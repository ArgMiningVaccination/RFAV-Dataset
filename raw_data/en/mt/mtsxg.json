PREFACE Legislative Requirements Two sections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) gove rn the establishment and revision of the national ambient air quality sta ndards (NAAQS). Section 108 (U.S. Code, 2003a) directs the Administrator to identify and lis t \"air pollutants\" that \"in hi s judgment, may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public heal th and welfare\" and whose \"prese nce in the ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources\" and to issue air quality criteria for those that are listed. Air quality criteria are inte nded to \"accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of identifiable effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of [a] pollutant in ambient air.\" Section 109 (U.S. Code, 2003b) directs the Ad ministrator to propose and promulgate \"primary\" and \"secondary\" NAAQS for pollutants li sted under Section 1 08. Section 109(b)(1) defines a primary standard as one \"the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on such criteria and allowi ng an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health.\"1 A secondary standard, as defi ned in Section 109(b)(2), must \"specify a level of air quality the attainment and maintenance of which, in the judgment of the Administrator, based on such crit eria, is required to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects asso ciated with the presence of [the ] pollutant in the ambient air.\"2 The requirement that primary standards incl ude an adequate margin of safety was intended to address uncertainties associated with inconclusive scientific and technical 1 The legislative history of Section 109 indicates that a primary standard is to be set at \"the maximum permissible ambient air level ... which will protect the health of any [sensitive] group of the population\" and that, for this purpose, \"reference should be made to a representative sample of persons comprising the sensitive group rather than to a single person in such a group\" [U.S. Senate (1970)]. 2 Welfare effects as defined in Section 302(h) [U.S. Code , 2005)] include, but are not limited to, \"effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, man-made materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility and climate, damage to and deterioration of property, and hazards to transportation, as well as effects on economic values and on personal comfort and well-being.\" ii information available at the time of standard set ting. It was also intende d to provide a reasonable degree of protection against hazards that research has not yet id entified. See Lead Industries Association v. EPA, 647 F.2d 1130, 1154 (D.C. Ci r 1980), cert. denied, 449 American Petroleum Institute 665 F.2d 1176, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1034 (1982). Both kinds of uncertainties are components of the risk associated with pollution at levels below those at which human health effects can be said to occur with reasonable scientific certainty. Thus, in select ing primary standards that include an adequate margin of safety, the Administrator is seeking no t only to prevent pollution levels that have been demonstrated to be harmful but also to prev ent lower pollutant levels that may pose an unacceptable risk of harm, even if the risk is not precisely identified as to nature or degree. In selecting a margin of safety, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers such factors as the na ture and severity of the health effects involved, the size of sensitive population(s) at ris k, and the kind and degree of the uncertainties that must be addressed. The selection of any pa rticular approach to providing an adequate margin of safety is a policy choice left specifically to the Administrator's judgment. See Lead Industries Association v. EPA, supra, 647 F.2d at 1161-62. In setting standards that are \"requisite\" to protect public health a nd welfare, as provided in Section 109(b), EPA's task is to establish st andards that are neither more nor less stringent than necessary for these purposes. In so doing, EPA may not consider th e costs of implementing the standards. See generally Whitman v. Am erican Trucking Associ ations, 531 U.S. 457, 465- 472 and 475-76 (2001). Section 109(d)(1) requires that \"not later than December 31, 1980, and at 5-year intervals thereafter, the Administrator sh all complete a thorough review of the criteria published under Section 108 and the national ambient air quality standards and shall make such revisions in such criteria and standards and promulgate such new standards as may be a ppropriate ....\" Section 109(d)(2) requires that an indepe ndent scientific review committ ee \"shall complete a review of the criteria ... and the national pr imary and secondary ambient air quality standard s ... and shall recommend to the Administrator any new standa rds and revisions of existing criteria and standards as may be appropriate ....\" Since the early 1980s, this independent review function has been performed by the Clean Air Scient ific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of EPA's Science Advisory Board. iii History of Reviews of the Primary NAAQS for NO 2 On April 30, 1971, EPA promulgated identi cal primary and secondary NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), under Section 109 of the Act, se t at 0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average (Federal Register, 1971). In 1982, EPA published an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD) for Oxides of Nitrogen (Environmental Protection Agency, 1982), which updated the scientific criter ia upon which the initial NO 2 standards were based. On February 23, 1984, EPA proposed to retain these standards (Federal Register, 1984). After taking into account public comments, EPA published the final decisi on to retain these standards on June 19, 1985 (Federal Register, 1985). On July 22, 1987, EPA announced that it wa s undertaking plans to revise the 1982 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen (Federal Register, 1987). In November 1991, EPA released an updated draft AQCD for CASAC and public review and comment (Federal Register, 1991). The draft document provided a compre hensive assessment of the avai lable scientific and technical information on heath and welfare effects associated with NO 2 and other oxides of nitrogen. CASAC reviewed the document at a meeting he ld on July 1, 1993, and concluded in a closure letter to the Administrator that the document \"p rovides a scientifically balanced and defensible summary of current knowledge of the effects of this pollutant and provides an adequate basis for EPA to make a decision as to the appropriate NAAQS for NO 2\" (Wolff, 1993). The EPA also prepared a draft Staff Paper that summarized and integrated the key studies and scientific evidence contained in the revised AQCD and identified the critical elements to be considered in the review of the NO 2 NAAQS. The Staff Paper recei ved external review at a December 12, 1994, CASAC meeting. CASAC comments and recomm endations were reviewed by EPA staff and incorporated in to the final draft of the Staff Paper as appropriate. CASAC reviewed the final draf t of the Staff Paper in June 1995 and responded by writt en closure letter (Wolff, 1995). In September of 1995, EPA fina lized the document enti tled, \"Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ni trogen Dioxide Assessment of Scientific and Technical Information\" (U.S. Envi ronmental Protection Agency, 1995). Based on that review, the Administrator announ ced her proposed decision not to revise either the primary or the secondary NAAQS for NO 2 (Federal Register, 19 95). The decision not to revise the NO 2 NAAQS was finalized after careful eval uation of the comments received on the iv proposal. The level for both the exis ting primary and secondary NAAQS for NO 2 is 0.053 ppm annual arithmetic average, calculated as the arithmetic mean of the 1-h NO 2 concentrations. v Integrated Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen - Health Criteria (First External Review Draft) 1.

It forms the scientific foundation for the review of the primary (health-based) National Ambien t Air Quality Standard s (NAAQS) for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2).1 The draft ISA is intended to \"accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of id entifiable effects on public health which may be expected from the presence of [a] pollutant in ambient air\" (Clean Air Act, Section 108 (42 U.S.C. 7408)).2 Scientific research is incorporated from: atmospheric sciences, air quality analyses, exposure assessment, dosimetry, controlled human exposure studies, toxicology, and epidemiology. This document focuses on the ga seous oxides of nitrogen. The draft ISA contains the key information and judgments formerly found in the Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD) for Oxides of Nitrogen. Also, a series of Annexes to the draft ISA provide more details of the most pertinent scientific literature. The draft ISA and the Annexes, thus serves to update and revise the information included in the 1993 AQCD document (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993). It will be useful at the outset to distinguish between the definition of \"nitrogen oxides\" as it appears in the en abling legislation related to the NAAQS and the definition commonly used in the air pollution research and management commun ity. In this document, the terms \"oxides of nitrogen\" and \"nitrogen oxides\" refer to all forms of oxidi zed nitrogen compounds, including nitric oxide (NO), n itrogen dioxide (NO 2), and all other oxidized nitrogen-containing compounds transformed from NO and NO 2. This follows usage in the Clean Air Act Section 108(c): \"Such criteria [for oxides of nitrogen] shall include nitr ic and nitrous acids, nitrites, nitrates, nitrosamines, and other carcinogenic an d potentially carcinogenic derivatives of oxides of nitrogen.\" By contrast, with in the air pollution research and control community, the terms \"oxides of nitrogen\" and \"nitrogen oxides\" are re stricted to refer only to the sum of NO and NO 2, and this sum is commonly abbreviated as NO x. The category label used by this community for 1 Information on legislative requirements and history of NO 2 NAAQS reviews are presented in the Preface. 2 The secondary NAAQS for NO 2 is being reviewed independently, in conjunction with the review of the secondary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide (SO 2). A review of the primary NAAQS for SO 2 is also underway.

For the current review, multiple species of many nitrogen oxides are considered, as appropriate and as allowed by the available data. For example, descriptions of the atmospheric chemistry of nitrogen oxides include both gaseou s and particulate species, because a meaningful analysis would not be possible otherwise. In addition, the health effect s of gaseous nitrogen oxides other than NO 2 are evaluated when information on th ese other species is available. Finally, the possible influence of other atmospheri c pollutants on the interpre tation of the role of NO 2 in health effects studies is considered, including interactions of NO 2 with other pollutants that co-occur in the environment (e.g., sulfur dioxide [SO 2], carbon monoxide [CO], ozone [O 3], particulate matter [PM]). The available database for this draft ISA largely provides information on the health effects of NO 2, with limited information examining other forms of oxides of nitrogen (e.g., nitrous acid [HONO]). As discussed in the Draft Integrated Plan for the Review of the Primary NAAQS for Nitrogen Dioxide (U.S. Environmental Protectio n Agency, 2007), a series of policy-relevant questions frames this review of the scientific evidence to provide a scientif ic basis for a decision on whether the current primary NAAQS for NO 2 (0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average) should be retained or revised. The draft IS A focuses on evaluation of the newly available scientific evidence to best inform considera tion of these framing questions, including the following: Has new information altered the scientific s upport for the occurrence of health effects 21 following short- and/or long-term exposure to levels of oxides of nitrogen found in the ambient air? What do recent studies focused on the near -roadway environment tell us about health 24 effects of oxides of nitrogen? At what levels of oxides of nitrogen expos ure do health effects of concern occur? 26 Has new information altered conclusions from previous reviews regard ing the plausibility 27 of adverse health effects caused by exposure to oxides of nitrogen? To what extent have important uncertainties identified in th e last review been reduced 29 and/or have new uncertainties emerged? August 2007 1-2 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE What are the air quality relationships be tween short-term and long-term exposures 1 to oxides of nitrogen? 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 29 31 1.1 DOCUMENT DEVELOPMENT The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency form ally initiated the current review of the NO 2 NAAQS by announcing the commencement of the re view in the Federal Register with a call for information (Federal Register, 2005). In addition to the call for information, publications are identified through an ongoing literature search process that includes searching MEDLINE and other databases using as key words the term s: nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide, NO, NO x, NO y, nitric acid, HNO 3, pernitric acid, 2, peroxyacytyl nitrate, PAN, and total reactive nitrogen. The search strategy is periodically r eexamined and modified to enhance identification of pertinent published papers. A dditional papers are id entified for inclusion in the publication base in several ways. First, EPA staff reviews pre-publication tables of c ontents for journals in which relevant papers may be published. Sec ond, expert chapter aut hors are charged with independently identifying relevant literature. Finally, additional publications that may be pertinent are identified by both the public and CASAC during the external review process. The focus of this ISA is on literature published si nce the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen. Key findings and conclusions from the 1993 review are di scussed in conjunction with recent findings. Generally, only information that has undergone scientific peer review and that has been published (or accepted for publication) in the ope n literature is considered. The following sections briefly summarize criteria for selection of studies fo r this draft ISA. General Criteria for Study Selection In assessing the scientific quality and relevance of epidemiological and human or animal toxicological studies, the follo wing considerations have been taken into account. To what extent are the aerometric data, expos ure, or dose metrics of adequate quality and 28 sufficiently representative to serve as credible exposure indicators? Were the study populations adequately selected and are they sufficiently well defined to 30 allow for meaningful comparisons between study groups? Are the health endpoint measuremen ts meaningful and reliable? 32 August 2007 1-3 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Does the study contain unique data such as the documentation of a previously unreported 1 effect, documentation of the mechanism for an observed effect, or information on exposure-response relationships? 2 3 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Are the statistical analyses appropriate, prope rly performed, and properly interpreted? 4 Are likely covariates (i.e., potential confounders or eff ect modifiers) adequately 5 controlled or taken into account in the study design and statistical analysis? Are the reported findings intern ally consistent, biologically plausible, and coherent in 7 terms of consistency with other known facts? Consideration of these is sues informs our judgments on the rela tive quality of individual studies and allows us to focus the assessment on the most pertinent studies. Criteria for Selecting Epidemiological Studies In selecting epidemiological studies for this assessment, EPA consid ered whether a given study contains information on (1) associations with measured oxides of nitrogen concentrations using short- or long-term exposures at or near ambient levels of oxides of nitrogen, (2) health effects of specific oxides of nitr ogen species or indicators related to oxides of nitrogen sources (e.g., motor vehicle emissions, combustion-rela ted particles), (3) health endpoints and populations not previously extensively research ed, (4) multiple pollutant analyses and other approaches to address issues related to potential confounding and modification of effects, and/or (5) important methodological issues (e.g., lag of effects, mode l specifications, thresholds, mortality displacement) related to interpretation of the health evidence. Among the epidemiological studies, particular emphasis has been focused on thos e most relevant to standard settings in the United States. Sp ecifically, studies conducted in th e United States or Canada are discussed in more detail than those from other geographic regions. Particular emphasis has been placed on: (A) new multicity studies that employ standardized methodological analyses for evaluating effects of oxides of nitrogen and that provide overa ll estimates for effects based on combined analyses of information pooled across multiple cities, (B) new studies that provide quantitative effect estimates for populations of interest, and (C) studies that consider oxides of nitrogen as a component of a comp lex mixture of air pollutants.

Studies that elucidate mechanisms of action and/or susceptibility, particularly if the st udies were conducted under atmospherically relevant conditions, are emphasized whenever possible. The selection of research eval uating controlled human exposures to oxides of nitrogen is mainly limited to studies in which subjects were exposed to <1 ppm NO 2. For these controlled human exposures, emphasis is placed on studies that (1) investigate potentially susceptible populations such as asthmatics, particularly studies that compare responses in susceptible individuals with those in age-ma tched healthy controls; (2) address issues su ch as concentration- response or time-course of respons es; (3) investigate exposure to NO 2 separately and in combination with other pollutants such as O 3 and SO 2; (4) include control exposures to filtered air; and (5) have sufficient stat istical power to assess findings. 1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE DOCUMENT This draft ISA includes five chapters. This introductory chapter (C hapter 1) presents background information on the purpose of the doc ument and characterizes how policy-relevant scientific studies are identified and selected for inclusion in the ISA. Chapter 2 highlights key concepts or issues relevant to understanding th e atmospheric chemistry, sources, exposure and dosimetry of oxides of nitrogen, following a \"source to dose\" paradigm. Chapter 3 evaluates and integrates health information relevant to the review of the primary NAAQS for NO 2. In this chapter, findings from epidemiological controll ed human exposure and to xicological studies are integrated into an assessment of the relationships between exposure to ambient oxides of nitrogen and health outcomes. This chapter focuses on the strength of epidemiological or toxicological evidence a nd the consistency, coherence, and plausibility of the body of evidence for effects on the respiratory, cardiovascular, or other system. Chapter 4 provides information relevant to the public health impact of e xposure to ambient oxides of nitrogen, including potential susceptible pop ulation groups.

In addition, a series of Annexes provide additional details of information in the ISA. Annex 1 is an introduction and background for the Annex series. In Annex 2, we present evidence related to the physical and chemical processes controlling the production, destruction, and levels of reactive nitroge n compounds in the atmosphere, including both oxidized and reduced species. Annex 3 presents informati on on environmental concen trations, patterns, and human exposure to ambient oxides of nitrogen. Annex 4 presents results from toxicological studies as well as information on dosimetry of oxid es of nitrogen. Annex 5 presents results from controlled human exposure studie s, and Annex 6 presents evidence from epidemiological studies. Annex tables for health studies are generally organized to include information about (1) concentrations of oxides of nitrogen levels or doses and ex posure times, (2) description of study methods employed, (3) results and comments, and (4) quantitative outcomes for oxides of nitrogen measures. Annexes 2 and 3 contain additional discussion of information because these Annexes will be used for other ISAs, such as Oxides of Sulfur (SO x). August 2007 1-6 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 2.

The order of topics essent ially follows that given in the National Research Council paradigm for integrating air pollutant research (National Rese arch Council, 1998). 2.1 INTRODUCTION As noted in Chapter 1, the definition of \"nitrogen oxides\" as it a ppears in the enabling legislation related to the NAAQS and the definition commonly used in the air pollution research and control community differ. In this document, the terms \"oxides of nitrogen\" and \"nitrogen oxides\" refer to all forms of oxidized nitr ogen compounds, including nitric oxide (NO), NO 2, and all other oxidized nitrogen-containing compounds transformed from NO and NO 2.1 In the Federal Register Notice for the last AQCD for Ox ides of Nitrogen (199 6), the term \"nitrogen oxides\" was used to \" describe the sum of NO, NO 2 and other oxides of nitrogen. \" Nitric oxide and NO 2, along with volatile organic co mpounds (VOCs); anthropogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, etc.) and carbon monoxide (CO), are precursors in the formation of ozone (O 3) and photochemical smog. Nitrogen di oxide is an oxidant and can react to form other photochemical oxidants, including organic nitrates like the peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs). Nitrogen dioxide can al so react with toxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to form nitro-PAHs, some of which are more toxic than either reactant alone. Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide (SO 2), another EPA criteria air pollutant, can also be oxidized to the strong minera l acids nitric acid (HNO 3) and sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4), respectively, thereby contributing to the aci dity of cloud, fog, and rainwa ter and ambient particles. 1 This follows usage in the Clean Air Act Section 108(c): \"Such criteria [for oxides of nitrogen] shall nitric and nitrous acids, nitrites, nitrat es, nitrosamines, and other carcinogenic and potentially carcinogenic derivatives of oxides of nitrogen.\" By contrast, within th e air pollution research and control community, the terms \"oxides of nitrogen\" and \"nitrogen oxides\" are restricted to refer only to the sum of NO and NO 2, and this sum is commonly abbreviated as NO x. The category label used by this community for the sum of all forms of oxidized nitrogen compounds including those listed in Section 108(c) is NO y.

Mechanisms for transporting O 3 precursors including NO x, the factors controlling the efficiency of O 3 production from NO x, methods for calculating O 3 from its precursors, and methods for measuring NO y were all reviewed in Section 2.6 of 2006 AQCD for O 3. The main points from 2006 AQCD for O 3 will be presented here along with updates based on new material. The overall chemistry of reac tive nitrogen compounds in th e atmosphere is summarized in Figure 2.2-1 and described in greater detail in this docum ent's Annex AX2.2. Nitrogen oxides are emitted by combustion sources mainly as NO with quantities of NO 2 typically in the range of 5 to 10% of NO. The major combustion sources of NO x, shown schematically in Figure 2.2-1, are motor vehicles and electrical utilities, although stationary engines, off-road vehicles, and industrial faciliti es also emit NO x. In addition to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning also produces NO x. And apart from these anthropogen ic sources, there are also smaller natural sources which include microbial activity in soils, lightning, and wildfires. NO and NO 2 are often grouped together and given the category label \"NO x\" because they are emitted together and can rapidly interconvert as shown in the inner box in Figure 2.2-1. Nitrogen dioxide reacts with various free radicals in the gas phase and on surfaces in multiphase processes to form the oxidation products s hown in Figure 2.2-1. These products include inorganic species (shown on the left side of the outer box in Fi gure 2.2-1) and organic species (shown on the right side of the outer box in Figur e 2.2-1). The oxidized n itrogen species in the outer box are often collectively termed NO z: thus, NO x + NO z = NO y. The time scale for reactions of NO x to form products shown in the outer box of Figure 2.2-1 typically ranges from a few hours during summer to about a day during winter. As a result, morning rush hour emissions of NO x can be converted almost completely to products by late afternoon during August 2007 2-2 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Figure 2.2-1.

As shown in Figure 2.2-1, different sources emit NO x at different altitudes. Because the prevailing winds aloft ar e generally stronger than those at the surface, emissions from elevated sources can be distri buted over a wider area than those emitted at the surface, and because of the time required for mixi ng of emissions to the surface, emissions of NO x from elevated sources will tend to be transformed to the more oxidized NO z products before they reach the surface. The concentrations and atmospheric lifetimes of inorganic and organic products from reactions of NO x vary widely in space and time. I norganic reaction produ cts include HONO, HNO 3, HNO 4, and particulate nitrate (pNO 3!). While a broad range of organic nitrogen compounds are emitted by combustion sources (e.g. nitr osamines and nitro-PAHs), they are also formed in the atmosphere from reactions of NO and NO 2. These include peroxyacyl and isoprene nitrates, other nitro-PAHs, and the more recently identified nitrated organic compounds August 2007 2-3 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 in the quinone family. The largest fractions of the mass of products shown in the outer box of Figure 2.2-1 are in the form of PAN and HNO 3, although other organic nitrates, e.g., isoprene nitrates and specific biogenic PANs can be important at locations near er to biogenic sources (Horowitz et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2007). In addition to gas-phase reactions, reac tions occurring on surfaces or occurring in multiple phases are important for the formation of HONO and pNO 3!. These reactions can occur on the surfaces of suspended particles, soil, and buildings and within aqueous media. The lifetime of PAN is strongly temperature dependent and is stab le enough at low temperatures to be transported long distances before decomposing to release NO 2, which can then participate in O 3 formation in these regions remote from the original NO x source. Nitric acid can act similarly to some extent, but its high solubility and fast depositi on rate mean that it is removed from the atmosphere by uptake on aqueous aeroso ls and cloud droplets or to the surface faster than PAN. Characteristic concentrations of ma ny of the oxides of nitrogen species are given in Annex AX3.2. As mentioned earlier, NO and NO 2 are important precursors of O 3 formation. However, because O 3 changes in a nonlinear way with the concen trations of its prec ursors, it is unlike many other secondarily-formed atmospheric species whose rates of formation vary directly with emissions of their precursors. At the low NO x concentrations found in most environments (ranging from remote continental areas to rura l and suburban areas downwind of urban centers) the net production of O 3 increases with increasing NO x. At the high NO x concentrations found in downtown metropolitan areas and especially near busy streets and roadways and in power plant plumes, net destruction of O 3 is initiated with the excess NO found there. In the high NO x regime, NO 2 scavenges OH radicals that would ot herwise oxidize VOCs to produce peroxy radicals, which would in turn oxidize NO to NO 2. In the low NO x regime, oxidation of VOCs generates excess free radicals, and hence O 3 production varies more nearly directly with NO x. Between these two regimes, there is a transition zone in which O 3 shows only a weak dependence on NO x concentrations. Formation of Nitro-PAHs Nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydr ocarbons (nitro-PAHs) are produ ced either by either direct emissions or by atmospheric reactions. Among co mbustion sources, diesel emissions have been August 2007 2-4 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 identified as the major source of nitro-PAHs in ambient air (Bezabeh et al., 2003; Gibson, 1983; 1986). Direct emissions of \"nitro-pa tts\" in PM vary with type of fuel, vehicle maintenance, and ambient c onditions (Zielinska et al ., 2004). In addition to being directly emitted, nitro-PAHs can also be formed from both gaseous and heterogeneous reactions of PAHs with gaseous nitrogen-cont aining pollutants in the atmosphere, with the reactions of OH and NO 3 radicals with PAHs being the majo r sources of nitro-PAHs. (Arey et 1989; Bamford and Bake r, 2003; Reisen and Arey, 2005 and references therein). Reactions involving OH and NO 3 radicals imply that nitro-PAH formation occurs during both daytime and nighttime in the atmosphere . The major loss process of nitro-PAHs is photodecomposition (Fan et al., 1996; Feilberg et al., 1999; Feilberg and Nielsen, 2001) with lifetimes on the order of hours, followed by reactions with OH and NO 3 radicals. The reaction mechanisms for forming and destroying nitro-PAHs in the atmosphere have been described in Section AX2.2.3. In ambient particulate organic matter (POM), 2-nitrofluoranthene (2NF) is the dominant compound, followed et al., 1989). 2NF and 2NP are not directly emitted from primary combustion emissions , but are formed in the atmosphere. 1NP is generally regarded as a tracer of primary combustion sources, in par ticular, diesel exhaust. After formation, nitro-PAHs with low vapor pressures (such as 2NF and 2NP) immediately migrate to particles under ambient conditions (Fan et al., 1 995; Feilberg et al., 1999). More volatile nitro- PAHs, such as nitronapthalene (NN) re main mainly in the gas phase. The concentrations for most nitro-PAHs f ound in ambient air are typically lower than 1 pg/m3, except NNs, 1NP, and 2NF, which can be pr esent at levels up to several tens or hundreds of pg/m3. These levels are much lower (~2 to ~1000 times lower) than their parent PAHs. However, nitro-PAHs are much more toxic than PAHs (Durant et al., Grosovsky et and Ohnishi, 1986). Moreover, most nitro-PAHs are present in particles with a mass median diameter of <0.1 \u00b5m.

The Fe deral Reference Method (FRM) for NO 2 makes use of this technique of NO detection with a prereq uisite step to reduce the NO 2 to NO on the surface of a molybdenum oxide (MoO x) substrate heated to between 300 and 400 C. Because the FRM monitor cannot detect NO 2, the concentration of NO 2 is determined as the difference between the samp le passed over the heated MoO x substrate (the nitrogen oxides total) and the sample not reduced (t he NO). However, the reduction of NO 2 to NO on the MoO x substrate is not specific to NO 2; hence, the chemiluminescence analyzers are subject to unknown and varying interferences produced by the presence in the sample of the other oxidized nitrogen compounds (i.e., NO z compounds shown in the outer box of Figure 2.2-1). Interference by NO z compounds has long been known (F ehsenfeld et al., 1987; Rodgers and Davis, 1989; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993, al., 2002; Dunlea et al., 2007). These studies have relied on intercomparisons of measurements using the FRM and other techniques for measuring NO 2. The sensitivity of the instrument to potential interference by individual NO z compounds is highly variable and is dependent in part on instrument inlet design and on the temperature of the reducing substrate, and on the interactions of species with the reducing substrate. Co mmercially available NO x monitors have been converted to NO y monitors by moving the MoO x convertor to interface dire ctly with the sample inle t. Because of losses on inlet surfaces and differences in the efficiency of reduction of NO z compounds on the heated MoO x substrate, NO x can not be considered as a universal surrogate for NO y. However, in settings close to relatively high concentration fresh emissions like thos e in urban areas during rush hour, most of the NO y is present as NO x. To the extent that all the major oxidized nitrogen species can be reduced quantitati vely to NO, measurements of NO y should be more reliable than those for NO x, particularly at typical ambient levels of NO 2. Routine measurement reporting of total NO y rather than of NO and NO 2 by subtraction has the additional benefit of characterizing the entire suite of oxidized nitrogen compounds to which humans are exposed. Reliable measurements of NO y and NO 2, especially at the low concentrations observed in many areas remote from sources are also crucial for eval uating the performance of three-dimensional, August 2007 2-6 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 chemical transport models of oxidant and ac id production in the atmosphere (described in Section AX2.7 of Annex 2). There are other approaches to measuring NO 2 that do not suffer from the artifacts mentioned above. For example, NO 2 can be photolytically reduced to NO, with an efficiency of about 70%. At present, however, this method requires additional development to ensure its cost effectiveness and reliability for extensive field deployment. The relatively low and variable conversion efficiency of this technique, for exam ple, means that increased attention to frequent calibration exercises would be required for rou tine operation. Optical methods such as those using differential optical absorption spectrosc opy (DOAS) or laser indu ced fluorescence (LIF) are also available, as descri bed in Section AX2.8 of Annex AX 2. However, these methods are even more expensive than either the FRM monito rs or photolytic reduction technique and require specialized expertise to operate as well; moreover, the DOAS is an area-integrated rather than a point-measured technique. 2.4 AMBIENT CONCENTRATIONS OF NO 2 AND ASSOCIATED OXIDIZED NITROGEN SPECIES AND POLICY RELEVANT BACKGROUND CONCENTRATIONS This section provides a brief summary of in formation on ambient concentrations of NO 2 and associated oxidized nitrogen compounds in the United States. It also provides estimates of Policy Relevant Background Concen trations, i.e., background conc entrations used to inform policy-relevant ons about the NAAQS. 2.4.1 Ambient Concentrations Figure 2.4-1 shows ambient concentrations of NO 2 measured at all monitoring sites located within Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA s) in the United States from 2003 through 2005. As can be seen from Figure 2.4-1, mean concentrations of NO 2 are about 15 ppb for averaging periods ranging from a day to a year, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 10 to 15 ppb. However, the average daily maximum hourly NO 2 concentrations are ~30 ppb. These values are about twice as high as the 24- h averages. The highest maximum hourly concentrations (~200 ppb) are more than a factor of ten higher than the mean hourly or 24-h concentrations. August 2007 2-7 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Figure 2.4-1. Ambient concentrations of NO 2 measured at all monitoring sites located within Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States from 2003 through 2005. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Recall from the discussion above that the FRM for NO 2 is subject to positive interference by other oxidized nitrogen compounds (NO z), and the degree of interference can be substantial. In particular, Dunlea et al. (2007) found an average of about 22% of ambient NO 2 (~9 to 50 ppb) measured in Mexico City wa s due to interference from NO z compounds. Comparable levels of NO 2 are found in many locations in the United Stat es. The Dunlea et al. (2007) results were based on comparison between the chemiluminescent in strument with other (optical) techniques. The main sources of interference were HNO 3 and various organic nitrates. Peak interference of up to 50% was found during afternoon hours and was associated with O 3 and NO z compounds such as HNO 3 and the alkyl and multifunctional alkyl nitrates. Data for concentrations of NO z constituent species in urban areas in the United States are sparse. The most comprehensive set of data for any NO z species was obtained for HNO 3 as part of the Children's Health Study for which gas-phase HNO 3 was measured at 12 sites in Southern California from 1994 through 2001 (Alcor n et al., 2004). Levels ranged from <1 ppb to >10 ppb August 2007 2-8 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 in general, the highest concentrations of HNO 3 and the highest ratio of HNO 3/NO 2 were found downwind of central Los Angeles in the San Be rnadino Valley during summer, as one would expect for this more oxidized nitrogen product. Measurements of HONO in urban areas are very limited; however, data from Stutz et al., (2004) and Wang et al., (2006) indicate that levels of HONO are <1 ppb even under heavily polluted cond itions (with the highest levels found during the night and just after dawn a nd lowest values found in the afternoon). Several field studies such as Hayden et al. (2003) in rural Quebec, Williams et al. (1987) near Boulder, CO, and Singh et al. (2007) in aircraft flight s over eastern North America have also found much higher levels of NO z compounds than NO x in relatively unpolluted rural air. Calculations with EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system for the mid-Atlantic region in a domain from Vi rginia-Southern New Jersey showed that the highest levels of HNO 3 and organic nitrates occur during mid-afternoon, consistent with their formation by photochemical processes that also produce O 3. Model calculat ions during an O 3 episode in July 2002 made for the Maryland State O 3 Implementation Plan (SIP) showed episode averages of the ratio NO z /NO 2 ranging from 0.26 to 3.6 in rural Virginia, with th e highest ratios in rural areas and lowest ratios in urba n centers nearer the sources of fresh NO x emissions. The capabilities of three-dimensional transport models like CMAQ and issues associated with their use are presented in Annex Section AX2.7. 2.4.2 Policy Relevant Background Con centrations of Nitrogen Dioxide Background concentrations of NO 2 used for purposes of informing decisions about NAAQS are referred to as Policy Relevant Back ground (PRB) concentrations. Policy Relevant Background concentrations are those concentrations that would occur in the United States in the absence of anthropogenic emissions in continenta l North America (defined here as the United States, Canada, and Mexico). Policy Relevant Background concen trations include contributions from natural sources everywhere in the world and from anthropogenic sources outside these three countries. Background levels so defined facilitate separation of pollution levels that can be controlled by U.S. regulations (or through intern ational agreements with neighboring countries) from levels that are generally uncontrollable by the United States. The EPA assesses risks to human health and environmental effects from NO 2 levels in excess of PRB concentrations.

Natural sources of NO 2 and its precursors include biogenic emissions, wildfires, lightning, and the stratosphere. Biogenic emissions from agricultural activities are not considered in the fo rmation of PRB concentrations. Discussions of the sources and estimates of emissions are given in Annex Section AX2.6.2. Analysis of Policy Relevant Ba ckground Contribution to Nitrogen Dioxide Concentrations over the United States The MOZART-2 global model of tropospheric chemistry (Horowitz et al., 2003) was used to diagnose the PRB contribution to NO 2 concentrations. The model setup for the present- day simulation has been published in a series of papers from a recent model intercomparison (Dentener et al., 2006ab; Shindell et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2006; van Noije et al., 2006). MOZART-2 is driven by Nationa l Center for Environmental Pr ediction meteorological fields and IIASA 2000 emissions at a horizontal resolution of 1.9\u00b0 H 1.9\u00b0 with 28 sigma levels in the vertical, and it includes gas-phase and aerosol chemistry. Results shown in Figure 2.4-2 are for the meteorological year 2001. An additional \"PRB\" simulation was conducted in which continental North American anthropoge nic emissions were set to zero. We first examine the role of PRB in contributing to NO 2 concentrations in surface air. Figure 2.4-2 shows the annual mean NO 2 concentrations in surf ace air in the base case simulation (top panel) and the PRB simulation (middle panel), along with the percentage contribution of the background to the total base case NO 2 (bottom panel). Maximum concentrations in the base case simulation occur along the Ohio River Valley and in the Los Angeles basin. While present-day concentr ations are often above 5 ppbv, PRB is less than 300 pptv over most of the continen tal United States, and less than 100 pptv in the eastern United States. The distribution of PRB (middle panel of Figure 2.4-2) largely reflects the distribution of soil NO emissions, with some local enhancements due to biomass burning such as in western Montana. In the northeastern United States, where present-day NO 2 concentrations are highest, PRB contributes <1% to the total. Thus, it appears that PRB levels of NO 2 are much smaller than observed levels.

People spend various amounts of time in different microenvironmen ts (Figure 2.5-1) characterized by different pollutant concentrations. The figure represents a composite average across the United States across all age groups. Different co horts, e.g., the elderly might be expected to exhibit different activity patterns. The integrated exposure of a person to a give n pollutant is the sum of the exposures over all time intervals for all microe nvironments in which th e individual spent time. Therefore, the personal exposure concen tration to a pollutant, such as NO 2, can be represented by the following equation: (2.5-1) 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 where E T is the time-weighted average personal expos ure concentration over a certain period of time, n is the total number of microenvironments that a person encounters, fi is the fraction of time spent in the ith microenvironment, and C i is the average concentration in the ith microenvironment during the time fraction, fi. The exposure a person experiences can be characterized as an instantaneous exposure, a peak exposure such as might occur during cooking, an average exposure, or an integrated exposur e over all environments a person encounters. These distinctions are important because health effects caused by long-term low-level exposures may differ from those caused by short-term peak exposures. An individual's total exposure ( ET) can also be represented by the following equation: (2.5-2) 25 26 subject to the constraint (2.5-3) 27 August 2007 2-12 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Figure 2.5-1.

Other symbols have the same definitions in Equation 2.5-2 and 2.5-3.

Indoor combustion sources such as gas stoves and space h eaters need to be considered when evaluating exposures to NO 2. Exposure misclassification may resu lt when total human exposure is not disaggregated between various microenvironments , and this may obscure the true relationship between ambient air pollutant e xposures and health outcomes. In a given microenvironment, the ambient component of a person's microenvironmental exposure to a pollutant is determined by the following physical factors. Ambient concentration The air exchange rate The pollutant specific penetration coefficient The pollutant specific decay rate The fraction of time an individual spends in the microenvironment These factors are in turn determined by th e following exposure fact ors (see Annex AX3.5). Environmental conditions, such as weather and season Dwelling conditions, such as the locati on of the house which determines proximity to sources and geographical features that can modify transport from sources; the amount of natu ral ventilation (e.g., open windows and doors, and the \"draftiness\" of the dwelli ng) and ventilation system (e.g., filtration efficiency and operation cycle) Personal activities, (e.g., the ti me spent cooking or commuting) Socioeconomic status, (e.g., the level of education and the income level) Demographic factors (e.g., age and gender) Indoor sources and sinks of a pollutant Microenvironmental line and point sources (e.g., lawn equipment) In general, the relationship between persona l exposures and ambien t concentrations can be modified by microenvironments in the follo wing ways: (1) during infiltration, ambient pollutants can be lost through chemical and physi cal loss processes, and therefore, the ambient August 2007 2-14 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 component of a pollutant's concentration in a mi croenvironment is not th e same as its ambient concentration but the product of the ambient concentration and the infiltration factor ( F inf or if people spend 100% of their time indoors) and (2 ) exposure to nonambient, microenvironmental sources. In practice, it is extremely difficult to characterize community exposures by measurements of each individual's personal expo sures. Instead, the distribution of personal exposures in a community, or the population exposure, is ch aracterized by extrapolating measurements of personal exposure using various techniques or by stochastic, deterministic or hybrid exposure modeling approaches such as APEX, SHEDS, and MENTOR (see AX3.7 for a description of modeling methods). Variations in community-level personal exposures are determined by cross-community variations in am bient pollutant concentrations and the physical and exposure factors mentioned above. These factors also determine the strength of the association between popul ation exposure to NO 2 of ambient origin and ambient NO 2 concentrations. 2.5.2 Ambient Monitors and Personal Exposures Of major concern is the ability of NO 2 measured by ambient monitors to serve as a good indicator of personal exposure to NO 2 of ambient origin. The key question is what errors are associated with using NO 2 measured by ambient monitors as a surrogate for personal exposure to ambient NO 2 in epidemiological studies. There are th ree aspects of this issue: (1) ambient and personal sampling issues; (2) the spatial variability of ambient NO 2 concentrations; (3) the associations between ambient concentrations and personal exposu res as influenced by exposure factors, e.g., indoor sources and sinks, and the time people spend indoors and outdoors. These issues are treated individually in the following subsections. 2.5.2.1 Ambient and Personal Sampling Issues Personal exposures in human exposure and panel studies of NO 2 health effects are monitored by passive samplers. Their perf ormance is evaluated by comparison to the chemiluminescence monitoring method. Some form of evaluation is crucial for determining measurement errors associated with exposure estimates. However, measurements of NO 2 are subject to artifacts both at the ambient level and at the personal level. As discussed above in Section 2.3, measurements of ambient NO 2 are themselves subject to variable interference August 2007 2-15 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE caused by other NO y compounds, in particular P ANs, organic nitrates, pNO 3!, and HONO and HNO 3. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 The most widely used passive samplers are Palmes tubes (Palmes et al., 1976), ura, and radial diffusive samplers (Cocheo et al., 1996). The theories behind and applications of Palmes T ubes and Yanagisawa badges have been described in the last AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993). Descriptions of the rest of th e commercialized samplers will be presented in detail in Annex Section AX3.3. Briefly, after penetrating into a passive sa mpler governed by Fick's law, environmental NO 2 is fixed by the adsorbent (Krupa and Legge, 2000). The sorbent can be either physically sorptive (e.g., active carbon) or chemisorptive (e .g., triethanolamine [TEA], KI, and arsenate sodium oxide [AsNaO 2]); passive samplers for NO 2 are chemisorptive, i.e., a reagent coated on a support (e.g., metal mesh, filt er) chemically reacts with and captures NO 2. The sorbent is extracted and analyzed for one or more reactive derivatives; the mass of NO 2 collected is derived from the conc entration of the derivative(s) ba sed on the stoichiometry of the reaction. The effect of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, wind speed, humidity) on the performance of passive samplers is a concern when used for residential indoor, outdoor, and personal exposure studies, because of sampling rates that deviate from ideal and can vary through the sampling period. Overal l, field test results of pass ive sampler performance are not consistent, and they have not been extensively studied over a wide range of concentrations, wind velocities, temperatures and relativ e humidities (Varshney and Singh, 2003). Another concern for passive sampling is interf erence from other pollutants. Interference from other NO y species can contribute to NO 2 exposure monitoring errors, but the kinetics and stoichiometry of interferent co mpound reactions have not been well established, especially for passive samplers. In the U.K., an NO 2 monitoring plan using a cost -effective, simpler tube-type passive sampler has been proposed and implemente d countrywide. However, in a comparison of NO 2 concentrations measured outdoors by the pa ssive samplers with those measured by the chemiluminescence method, NO 2 concentrations measured by th e passive samplers were ~30% higher than those measured by the chemilu minescence method (Campbell et al., 1994).

As mentioned before, TEA-based diffusive sampling methods tend to overestimate NO 2 concentrations in field comparisons with chemiluminescence analyzers (Campbell et al., 1994). This could be due in part to chemical reactions between O 3 and NO occurring in the diffusion tube, or differential sensitivity to other forms of NO y, such as HONO, PAN, and HNO 3, between the passive samplers and the chemiluminescence analyzers (Gair et al., 1991). Due to spatial and temporal variability of NO and NO 2 concentrations, especially at roadsides wh ere NO concentrations are relatively high and when sufficient O 3 is present for interconversion between the species, the lack of agreement between the passive samplers and ambient mon itors can represent differences in sampler response (Heal et al., 1999; Cox, 2003). A third aspect of passive sampler perfo rmance is that, compared with ambient chemiluminescence monitors, passive samplers give relatively longer time averaged concentrations (from days to w eeks). Consequently, diffusive sa mplers including those used for NO 2 monitoring provide integrated but not high time-resolution concentration measurements. Hourly fluctuations in NO 2 concentrations may be important to the evaluation of exposure-health effects relationships, and continuous monitors, su ch as the chemiluminescent monitors, remain the only approach for estimating short-term peak exposures. 2.5.2.2 Spatial Variability 2.5.2.2.1 Spatial Variability of Ambient NO 2 Concentrations Summary statistics for the spatial variability in several urban areas across the United States are shown in Table 2.5-1. These areas we re chosen because they are the major urban areas with at least five monito rs operating from 2003 to 2005. Values in parentheses below the city name indicate the number of monitoring sites in that partic ular city. The second column shows the mean concentration across all sites and the range in means at individual sites. The third column gives the range of Pearson correlation coefficients be tween individual site pairs in the urban area. The fourth column shows the 90th percentile absolute difference in August 2007 2-17 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 concentrations between site pair s. The fifth column gives the coefficient of divergence (COD), an indication of the variability across the m onitoring sites in each ci ty; a COD value of 0 indicates there are no differences between concentr ations at paired site s (spatial homogeneity), while a COD value approaching 1 indicat es extreme spatially heterogeneity. As can be seen from the table, mean concentr ations at individual si tes vary by factors of 1.5 to 6 in the MSAs examined. The sites in New York City tend to be the most highly correlated and show the highest mean levels, reflec ting their proximity to traffic, as evidenced by the highest mean concentration of a ll the entries. They are also located closer to each other than sites in western cities. Correlations between indi vidual site pairs range from slightly negative to highly positive in all of the urban areas excep t for New York City. However, correlation coefficients are not sufficient for describing spatia l variability as concentr ations at two sites may be highly correlated but show differences in levels. Thus, the range in mean concentrations is given. Even in New York City, the spread in mean concentrations is about 40% of the citywide mean (12/29). The relative spread in mean con centrations is larger in the other urban areas shown in Table 2.5-1. As might be expected, th e 90th percentile concen tration ranges are even larger than the ranges in the means. The same statistics as shown in Table 2.5-1 have been used to describe the spatial variability of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004; Pinto et al., 2005) and O 3 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2006). However, because of relative sparseness in data coverage for NO 2, spatial variability in all cities that were considered for PM 2.5 and O 3 could not be considered. Thus, the number of cities included here is much smaller than for either O 3 (24 urban areas) or PM 2.5 (27 urban areas). Even in those cities where there were monitors for all three pollutants, data may not have been collected at the same locations, and even if they were, there will be different responses to local sources. For example, concentrations of NO 2 collected near traffic wi ll be highest in an urba n area, but concentrations of O 3 will tend to be lowest there because of titration by NO forming NO 2. However, some general observations can still be made. Mean concentrations of NO 2 at individual monitoring sites are not as highly variable as for O 3 but are more highly variable than PM 2.5. Lower bounds on intersite correlation coefficients for PM 2.5 and for O 3 tend to be much higher than NO 2 in the same areas shown in Table 2.5-1. CODs for PM 2.5 are much lower than for O 3, whereas CODs for NO 2 tend to be the largest amon g these three pollutants.

Depending on the pollutant, either there can be positive, negative, or no vertical gradient from the surface to the monitor inlet. Positive gradients (i.e., concentrations increase with heig ht) result when pollutants are formed over large areas by atmospheric photochemical reactions (i.e., secondary pollutants such as O 3) and destroyed by deposition to the surface or by reacti on with pollutants emitted near the surface. Pollutants that are emitted by sources at or ju st above ground level show negative vertical gradients. Pollutants with area sources (widely dispersed surface sources) and that have minimal deposition velocities show little or no vertical gradient. Restrepo et al. (2004) compared data for criteria pollutants collected at fixed monitoring sites at 15 m above the surface on a school rooftop to those measured by a van whose inlet wa s 4 m above the surface at monitoring sites in the South Bronx during two sampling periods in November and December 2001. They found that CO, SO 2, and NO 2 showed negative vertical gradients, whereas O 3 showed a positive vertical gradient and PM 2.5 showed no significant vertical gr adient. As shown in Figure 2.5-2, NO 2 mixing ratios obtained at 4 m (mean ~74 ppb) we re about a factor of 2.5 higher than at 15 m (mean ~30 ppb). Because tail pipe emissions occur at lower heights, NO 2 values could have been much higher nearer to the su rface and the underestimation of NO 2 values by monitoring at 15 m even larger. Restrepo et al. (2004) noted that the use of the NO 2 data obtained by the stationary monitors underestimates human exposures to NO 2 in the South Bronx. This situation is not unique to the South Bronx and could arise in other large urban areas in the United States with populations of similar demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Thus, weak associations might be found between concentrations at ambient monitors and other outdoor locations and between concentrations in i ndoor microenvironments and personal exposures in part because of the spatial (horizontal and vertical) vari ability in NO 2. As mentioned earlier, there are far fewer monitors for NO 2 than for O 3 or PM 2.5. Consequently, NO 2 ambient monitors may be less representative of community or personal exposures than are ambient monitors O 3 or PM 2.5 for their respective exposures.

Penetration of outdoor NO 2 and combustion in various forms are the major sources of NO 2 to indoor environments, e.g., homes, schools, restaurants, and thea ters. As might be expected, indoor con centrations of NO 2 in the absence of combusti on sources are determined by the infiltration of outdoor NO 2 (Spengler et al., 1994; Weschler and Shields, 1994; Levy et al., 1998b), with potentially significan t indoor contributions from ch emical reactions of NO in August 2007 2-20 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 exhaled breath with O 3 (see AX3.4.2 for sample calculations). Indoor sources of nitrogen oxides have been characterized in several reviews, name ly the last AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993); the Revi ew of the Health Ri sks Associated with Nitrogen Dioxide and Sulfur Dioxi de in Indoor Air for Health Ca nada (Brauer et al., 2002); and the Staff Recommendations for revision of the NO 2 Standard in Califor nia (California Air Resources Board, 2006). Mechanisms by which nitrogen oxides are produ ced in the combustion zones of indoor sources were reviewed in th e last AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993) and will not be repeated here. Sources of ambient NO 2 are reviewed in AX2.6. It should also be not ed that indoor sources can affect ambient NO 2 levels, particularly in areas in which atmo spheric mixing is limited, such as in valleys. Combustion of fossil fuels and biomass is th e major primary source of nitrogen oxides. Combustion of fossil fuels occurs in appliances used for cooking, heating, and drying clothes, e.g., oil furnaces, kerosene space heaters, coal stoves. Motor vehicles and various types of generators in structures attached to living areas al so contribute NO 2 to indoor environments. Indoor sources of NO 2 from biomass include wood bur ning fireplaces and wood stoves and tobacco. A large number of studies, as described in the reviews cited above , have all noted the importance of gas cooking appliances as sources of NO 2 emissions. Depending on geographical location, season, other sources of NO 2, length of monitoring period, and household characteristics, homes with gas cooking applia nces have approximately 50% to over 400% higher NO 2 concentrations than homes with electric cooking applian ces (Gilbert et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2000; Garcia-Algar et al ., et al., 2004; Leaderer et al., 1986; Garcia-Algar, 2003). Gas cooking appliances remain si gnificantly associated with indoor NO 2 concentrations after adjusting for several potential confounders including season, type of community, socioeconomic status, use of extractor fans, household smoking, and type of heating (Garcia- Algar et al., 2004; Garrett, 1999). Homes with gas appliances with pilot lights emit more NO 2 resulting in NO 2 concentrations ~10 ppb higher than in homes with gas appliances with electronic ignition (Spengler et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1998). Sec ondary heating appliances are additional sources of NO 2 in indoor environments, particularly if the appliances are unvented or inadequately vented. As heating costs increase , the use of these seconda ry heating appliances tends to increase.

Results summarized by Brauer et al. (2001) indicate that concentrations of NO 2 in homes with unvented gas hot wa ter heaters were 10 to 21 ppb higher than in homes with vented heaters, which in turn, had NO 2 concentrations 7.5 to 38 ppb higher than homes without gas hot water heaters. Table 2.5-2 shows short-term average (i.e., minutes to hours) concentrations of NO 2 in homes with combustion sources (mainly gas fi red), and Table 2.5-3 shows long-term average (i.e., 24 h to 2 weeks) concentrations of NO 2 in homes with mainly gas combustion sources. As can be seen from Tables 2.5-2 and 2.5-3, shorter-term average c oncentrations tend to be much higher than longer-term averages. As Triche et al. (2005) indicated, the 90th percentile concentrations can be substantia lly greater than the medians, even for 2-week samples. This finding illustrates the high variability of indoor NO 2 found among homes, reflecting differences in ventilation of emissions from sources, air exchange rates, the size of rooms, etc. The concentrations for short averagi ng periods that are li sted in Table 2.5-2 correspond to about 10 to 30 ppb on a 24-h average basis. As can be seen from inspection of Table 2.5-3, these sources would contribute significan tly to the longer-term averages report ed there if operated on a similar schedule on a daily basis. This implies that m easurements made with long averaging periods may not capture the nature of the diurna l pattern of indoor c oncentrations of NO 2 in homes with strong indoor sources, a problem that becomes more evident as ambient NO 2 levels decrease with more efficient controls on outdoor sources. The contribution of NO 2 from combustion of biomass fuels has not been studied as extensively as that from gas. A main conclusion from the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen was that properly vented wood stoves and fireplaces would make only minor contributions to indoor NO 2 levels and several studies conclude th at using wood burning appliances does not increase indoor NO 2 concentrations (Levesque et al., 2001; Triche et al., 2005). Other indoor combustion sources of NO 2 are candle burning and sm oking. In a study of students living in Copenhagen, Sorensen et al . (2005) found that pers onal exposures to NO 2 were significantly associated with time exposed to bur ning candles in addition to other sources (data not reported). Results of studies relating NO 2 concentrations and exposures to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) have been mixed. Several studies found positive associations between August 2007 2-22 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 NO 2 levels and ETS (e.g., Linaker et al., 1996; Fa rrow et al., 1997; Alm al., 1998; Levy, 1998; Monn et al., 1998; Cyrys et al., 2000 ; Lee et al., 2000; Garcia-Alg ar, 2004) whereas others have not (Madany et al., 1993; Hackney et al., 1992; Kawamoto et al., 1993). Some copollutants could be generated from indoor combustion sources along with NO 2. Spicer et al. (1993) compared the measured increase in HONO in a test house resulting from direct emissions of HONO from a gas range and from production by surface reactions of NO 2. They found that emissions from the gas range co uld account for ~84% of the measured increase in HONO. In a study of Southern California homes (Lee et al., 2002), indoor levels of NO 2 and HONO were positively associated with the presence of gas ranges. Rogge et al. (1993) reported that most of th e particle mass emitted from a vented natural gas space heater and a hot water heater was in the form of organic compounds. About 26% of the mass could be ascribed to single organic compounds, the majority of which were PAHs, oxy- PAHs, aza arenes, and thia arenes. Brown et al. (2004) characterized emissions of NO 2, formaldehyde (HCHO), carbon mon oxide (CO) and a number of hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and acids from unvented gas heaters in a chamber study in Australia. They found highly variable concentrations of these pollutants depending on th e model of heater and operating conditions. Concentrations of NO 2 in their room-sized test chambe r ranged from 180 to 810 ppb; HCHO ranged from <10 to 2100 ppb; CO ranged from ~1 to 18 ppm along with smaller amounts of PM 2.5 and hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and acids. Chemistry in indoor settings can be both a source and a sink for NO 2 (Weschler and Shields, 1997). NO 2 is produced by reactions of NO with O 3 or peroxy radicals, while NO 2 is removed by gas phase reactions with O 3 and assorted free radicals and by surface-promoted hydrolysis and reduction reactions. The concentration of indoor NO 2 also affects the decomposition of PAN. Each of these processes is discussed below. Indoor NO can be oxidized to NO 2 by reacting with O 3 or peroxy radicals. The latter are generated by indoor air chemistry involving O 3 and unsaturated hydrocarbons such as terpenes found in air fresheners and other household pr et al., 2002a,b; Nazaroff and Weschler, 2004; Carslaw, 2007). At an indoor O 3 concentration of 10 ppb and an indoor NO concentration that is significantly smaller than that of O 3, the half-life of NO is 2.5 min (using kinetic data contained in Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 2006). This reaction is sufficiently fast to compete with even August 2007 2-23 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 relatively fast air exchange rates. Hence, the amount of NO 2 produced from NO tends to be limited by the amount of O 3 available (Weschler et al., 1994). NO 2 reacts with O 3 to produce nitrate radicals (NO 3). To date, there have been no indoor measurements of the concentration of NO 3 radicals in indoor setti ngs. Modeling studies by Nazaroff and Cass (1986), Weschler et al. (1992) , Sarwar et al. (2002b), and Carslaw et al. (2007) estimate indoor NO 3 radical concentrations in the ra nge of 0.01 to 5 parts per trillion (ppt), depending on the indoor levels of O 3 and NO 2. Once formed, NO 3 can oxidize organic compounds by either adding to an unsaturate d carbon bond or abstra cting a hydrogen atom (Wayne et al., 1991). In certain indoor settings , the nitrate radical may be a more important indoor oxidant than either O 3 or the hydroxyl radical (Naz aroff and Weschler, 2004; Wayne et al., 1991). Thus, NO 3 radicals and the products of NO 3 radical chemistry may be meaningful confounders in NO 2 exposure studies. Reactions between NO 2 and various free radicals can be an indoor source of organo- nitrates, analogous to the chain-terminating reactions observed in photochemical smog (Weschler and Shields, 1997). Additionall y, based on laboratory measurements and measurements in outdoor air (Finlayson-Pitts and Pitts, 2000), one would anticipate that NO 2, in the presence of trace amounts of HNO 3, can react with PAHs sorbed onto indoor surfaces to produce mono- and dinitro-PAHs. Nitrogen diox ide can also be reduced on certain surfaces, forming NO. Spicer et al. (1989) fo und that as much as 15% of the NO 2 removed on various indoor surfaces was reemitted as NO. Weschler and Shields (1996) found that the amount of NO 2 removed by charcoal filters used in buildings were almost equally matched by the amount of NO subsequently emitted by the same filters. Nitrogen dioxide can also be converted to HONO indoors through air chemistry. As noted earlier in this chapter, HONO occurs in the atmosphere mainly through multiphase processes involving NO 2. Nitrous acid has been observed to form on surfaces containing partially oxidized aromatic structures (Stemm ler et al., 2006) and on s oot particles (Aumann et al., 1998). Indoors, surface-to-volume ratios are much larger than outdoors, and the surface-mediated hydrolysis of NO 2 is a major indoor source of HONO (Brauer et al., al., 1993; Wainman et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002). Lee et al. (2002) repor ted average indoor HONO levels were about 6 times higher than outdoor levels (4.6 versus 0.8 ppb). Indoor HONO con centrations averaged August 2007 2-24 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 17% of indoor NO 2 concentrations, and the two were strongly correlated. Indoor HONO levels were higher in homes with humidifiers compared to homes without humidifiers (5.9 versus 2.6 ppb). This last observation is consistent with the studies of Brauer et al. (1993) and Wainman et al. (2001), indicati ng that the production rate of HONO from NO 2!surface reactions is larger at higher relative humidities. Spicer et al. (1993) reported that an equilibrium between adsorption of HONO from the gas range (or other i ndoor combustion sources) and HONO produced by surface reactions determines the relative impor tance of these processes in producing HONO in indoor air. 2.5.2.3.2 Associations among Ambient and Ou tdoor Concentrations and Personal Exposures Results of studies showing associations be tween ambient concentr ations and personal exposures are shown in Table 2.5-4A and result s of studies showing associations between outdoor concentrations and personal exposures are shown in Table 2.5-4B. Figure 2.5-3 summarizes these correlation coeffici ents with box-whisker plots. The association between personal NO 2 exposure and ambient and outdoor NO 2 concentrations varies from poor to good as s hown in Tables 2.5-4A and B, with stronger associations generally found when outdoor rather than ambient concentrations are used. This situation arises in part because outdoor measurements are generally made much closer to study participants' homes than are measurements of ambient NO 2 concentrations (cf. Section 2.5.2.2). Associations between ambient concentrations and personal exposures were not stratified by the presence of indoor sources, except in Alm et al. (1998) and Sarn at et al. (2006). The strength of the association between pers onal exposures and ambient and/or outdoor concentrations for a population is determined by va riations in indoor or other local sources, air exchange rate, penetration, and decay rate of NO 2 in different microenvironments and the time people spend in different microe nvironments with different NO 2 concentrations. Alm et al. (1998) indicated that the associ ation between personal exposure and outdoor concentration was stronger than the correlation be tween personal exposure and central site concentration.

Home ventilation is another im portant factor modifying the personal-ambient relationships; one would expect to observe the strongest associations for subjects spending time indoors with open windows. Alm et al. (1998) and Kodama et al. (2002) observed the association between personal exposure and ambi ent concentration became stronger during the summer than the winter. However, Sa rnat et al. (2006) reported that R 2 values decreased from 0.34 for a low ventilation population to 0.16 for a hi gh ventilation population in the summer, and from 0.47 to 0.34 in the fall. The association between personal exposure a nd ambient concentrati on is complicated and is determined by many factors. Exposure misclassi fication might occur if a single factor, such as August 2007 2-26 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 season or ventilation status, is used as an exposure indicator. Higher personal to ambient correlation has been found for subjects living in ru ral areas and lower correlation with subjects living in urban areas (Rojas-Brac ho et al., 2002; Alm et al., 1998). Spengler et al. (1994) also observed that the relationship between personal exposure and out door concentration was highest in areas with lower ambient NO 2 levels (R2 = 0.47) and lowest in areas with higher ambient NO 2 levels (R2 = 0.33). This might reflect th e highly heterogeneous distribu tion or the effect of local sources of NO 2 in an urban area, and personal activities are more diverse in an urban area. However, it is also possible that indoor sour ces could explain more personal exposure when ambient concentrations become lower and more homogeneously distributed. When there is little or no contribution from indoor sour ces, ambient concentrations primarily determine exposure; however, if ther e are indoor sources, th e importance of outdoor levels in determining personal exposures de creases. The association between ambient concentrations and personal exposures streng thens after controlling for indoor sources. Raaschou-Nielsen et al. (1997), Spengler et al. (1994), and Gauvin et al. (2001) reported that R2 values increased by 10 to 40% after controlling for indoor sources, such as gas appliances and ETS. The correlation coefficient between personal exposures and ambient concentrations has different meanings for different study designs. There are three types of correlations generated from different study designs: longitudinal, \"pooled,\" and daily-average correlations. Longitudinal correlations are calculated when data from a study includes measurements over multiple days for each subject (longitudinal study design). Longitudinal correlations describe the temporal relationship between daily personal NO 2 exposure or microenvironment concentration and daily ambient NO 2 concentration for each individual subject. The longitudinal correlation coefficient may differ for each subject. The dist ribution of correlations across a population could be obtained with this type of data. Pooled co rrelations are calculated when a study involves one or only a few measurements per subject and when different subjects are studied on subsequent days. Pooled correlations combine individual subject/individual day data for the calculation of correlations.

The type of correlation analysis can have a substantial effect on th e value of the resultant correlation coefficient. Mage et al. (1999) showed that very low correlations between personal exposure and am bient concentrations could be obtained when people with very di fferent non-ambient exposures are pooled, even though their individual longitudinal correlations are high. Most studies, (employing both cross- sectional and longitudinal study designs) examined in the current review showed that ambient NO 2 is associated with personal NO 2 exposure, however, the streng th of the association varied considerably. 2.5.2.3.3 Ambient Contribution to Personal NO 2 Exposure Another aspect of the relationship of personal NO 2 exposure and ambient NO 2 is the contribution of ambient NO 2 to personal exposures. The infiltration factor ( Finf) and alpha ( ) are the keys to evaluate personal NO 2 exposure of ambient origin. As defined in Equations 2.5-2 through 2.5-5, the infiltration factor ( Finf) of NO 2, the physical meaning of which is the fraction of ambient NO 2 found in the indoor environment, is determined by the NO 2 penetration coefficient ( P), air exchange rate (a), and the NO 2 decay rate ( k). Alpha ( ) is a function of Finf and the fraction of time people spend outdoors ( y), and the physical meaning of is the ratio of personal ambient exposure concen tration to ambient concentrati on, in the absence of exposures to non-ambient sources (i.e., when E na = 0). The values for and F inf can be calculated physically through Equations 2.5-2 through 2.5-5, if P , k, a, and y are known. However, the values of P and k for NO 2 are rarely reported, and in most mass balance modeling work, P is assumed to equal 1 and k is assumed to equal 0.99 h!1, (Yamanaka, 1984; Yang et al., 2004; Dim itroulopoulou et al., 2001; Kulkarni et al., 2002). It is well known that P and k are dependent on a large number of indoor parameters, such as temperature, relative humidity, surface propert ies, surface-to-volume ratio, the turbulence of airflow, building type and coexisting pollutant s (Lee et al., 1996; Cotterill et al., Monn et 2003; Sorensen et al., 2005; Zota et al., 2005). As a result, using a fixed value, as mentioned above, would either over- or underestimate the true or Finf. It should also be pointed out that both P and k are functions of the complicated mass transfer processes that occur on indoor surf aces, and therefore, are associ ated with air exchange rate, August 2007 2-28 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE which has an impact on the turbulence of indoor airflows. However, the relationship between P, k, and a has not been thoroughly investigated. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Alternatively, the ratio of personal exposure to ambient concentration can be regarded as in the absence of indoor or nonambient sources. Only a few studies have reported the value and distribution of the ratio of personal NO 2 exposure to ambient NO 2 concentration, and even fewer studies reported the value and distribution of based on sophisticated study designs. Rojas-Bracho et al. (2002) repor ted the median personal/outdoor ratio was 0.64 (with an IQR of 0.45), but the authors reported that was overestimated by this rati o because of indoor sources. The random component superposition (RCS) mo del is an alternative way to calculate Finf or using observed ambient and personal exposure concentrations (Ott et al., 2000). The RCS statistical model (shown in Equation 2.5-2 through 2.5-5) uses the slope of the regression line of personal concentration on the ambient NO 2 concentration to estimate the population averaged attenuation factor and means a nd distributions of ambient and nonambient contributions to personal NO 2 concentrations (the intercept of the regression is the averaged nonambient contribution to personal exposure) (U.S. Environmental Protecti on Agency, 2004). As shown in Table 2.5-5, calculated by the RCS model ranges from 0.3 to 0.6. Similarly, as shown in Table 2.5-6, F in ranges from 0.4 to 0.7. The RCS model calculates ambi ent contributions to indoor concentrations and personal exposures based on the statistical inferences of regression analys is. However, personal-outdoor regressions could be affected by extr eme values (outliers either on the x or the y axis). Another limitation of the RCS model is that this mode l is not designed to estimate ambient and nonambient contributions for individuals, in part because the use of a single value for does not account for the large home-to-home variations in actual air exch ange rates and penetration and decay rates of NO 2. In the RCS model, is also determined by the se lection of the predictor. Using residential outdoor NO 2 concentrations as the model pr edictor might give a different estimate of than using ambient NO 2 because of the spatial variability of NO 2 mentioned early in this section. Personal exposure levels in most of the stud ies considered here were lower than the corresponding outdoor or ambient leve ls. In the presence of local sources (indoor or local traffic sources not accounted for by the ambient monitor), personal exposure levels could be higher than outdoor or ambient levels (Spengler et al ., 1994, 1996; Nakai et et al., 1996; August 2007 2-29 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 1997; Alm et al., 1998; Levy et al., 1998; M onn et al., 1998; Liard et al., 1999; Kramer et al., 2000; al., et al et al., 2001; et al., 2001; Sarnat et al., 2001, 2005, odama et Mosqueron et et al., 2005; Sorensen et al ., 2005; Kim et al., 2006). Nerriere et al. (2005) investigat ed factors determining the discrepancies between personal exposure and ambient levels in the Genotox ER study in France (Grenoble, Paris, Rouen, and Strasbourg). The authors reported that factors a ffecting the concentrati on discrepancies between personal exposure and correspondi ng ambient monitoring site con centrations were season, city and land use dependent. During th e winter, city and land use account for 31% of the variation of the discrepancy, and during the summer, 54% of the variation in the discrepancy can be explained by these factors. When using the ambi ent site to represent ambient levels, the largest difference between ambient and personal exposure was found at the \"proximity to traffic\" site, while the smallest difference was found at the \"background\" site . When using urban background site as ambient level, the largest difference was observed at the \"industry\" site, and the smallest difference was observed at the b ackground site, which reflected the heterogeneous distribution of NO 2 in an urban area. During winter, differen ces between ambient site and personal exposure concentrations were larger than those in the summer. In summary, NO 2 is monitored at far fewer sites than either O 3 or PM. Significant spatial variations in ambient NO 2 concentrations were observed in urban areas. Measurements of NO 2 are subject to artifacts both at the ambient level and at the pers onal level. Personal exposure to ambient and outdoor NO 2 is determined by many factors as listed in Section 2.5.1 and mentioned previously in Section 2.5.2. Th ese factors all help determine the contribution of ambient NO 2 to personal exposures. Personal activities determin e when, where, and how people are exposed to NO 2. The variations of these physical and expos ure factors determine the strength of the association between personal exposure and ambien t concentrations both l ongitudinally and cross- sectionally. In the absence of indoor a nd local sources, personal exposures to NO 2 are between the ambient level and the indoor level. However, personal exposures could be much higher than either indoor or outdoor concentrat ions in the presence of these s ources. A number of studies found that personal NO 2 was associated with ambient NO 2, but the strength of the association ranged from poor to good.

Reasons for the differences in study resu lts are not clear, but are related in large measure to differences in study design, to the spatial heterogeneity of NO 2 in study areas, to indoor sources, to the seasonal and geographic vari ability in the infiltration of ambient NO 2, and to differences in the time spent in different microenvironments. Measurement artifacts at the ambient level and difference s in analytical measurement capabilities among different groups could also have contributed to th e mixed results. The collective variability in all of the above parameters, in general, contribut es to exposure misclassi fication errors in air pollution-health outcome studies. The association between community average exposures and ambient concentrations is more directly relevant to epidem iological studies, in which ambien t concentrations are used as a surrogate for community exposure. Liard et al. (1999) conducted an exposure study for office workers and children in Paris. Three 4-day averaged measurements were conducted for both adults and children, and personal NO 2 exposures were measured at the same time for each study participant. The authors reported that the population-averaged exposure during each measurement fluctuated with the ambient concentration, with an r s of 1, although the correlation coefficient based on individual measurements was low (Table 2.5-4A). The findings in this study support the assumption in tim e-series epidemiological studies that ambient concentrations are a reasonable surrogate for community av erage exposures. Monn et al. (1998) and Monn (2001) reported personal NO 2 exposures obtained in the SAPA LDIA study (eight study centers in Switzerland). In each study location, personal exposures for NO 2 were measured simultaneously for all participants, as well as the residential outdoor concentrations (Table 2.5-4B). Monn (2001) observed a strong associati on between the average personal exposures in each study location and corresponding average outdoor concentrations with an R2 of 0.965. As pointed out by the author, in an analysis of individual single exposure and outdoor concentration data, personal versus outdoor R2 was less than 0.3 (Monn et al ., 1998). The results of Monn (2001) imply that long-term averaged ambient concentrations are a good surrogate for population exposures. August 2007 2-31 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 2.5.2.4 Exposure Measurement Error in Epidemiological Studies: NO 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 In many air pollution epidemiological studies , especially time-series studies with administrative data on mortality and hospitali zation outcomes, data from central ambient monitoring sites generally are used as the estimate of exposure. Personal exposures of individual study subjects generally ar e not directly measured in epidemiological studies. Routinely collected ambient monitor data, though readily av ailable and convenient, may not represent true personal exposure, which includes both ambient and nonambient (i.e., indoor) source exposures. Also, personal exposure measurements may or ma y not be subject to th e same artifacts as the ambient measurements. Therefore, they may not be measuring the same quantities. Zeka and Schwartz (2004) state that each pollutant, as measured at a central site in each city, is a surrogate for exposure to the same pollutant in personal exposure measurements. In considering exposure error, it should be noted that total personal exposure can be partitioned into two types of sources, ambient and nonambient. Sheppard (2005) notes that nonambient source exposures typically vary acro ss individuals, but the community averages do not vary across communities. In addition, nonambi ent exposures are not li kely to have strong temporal correlations. In cont rast, ambient concentrations ac ross individuals should be highly correlated, as they tend to vary over time simila rly for everyone because of changes in source generation, weather, and season. The indepe ndence of ambient and nonambient exposure sources has important implication. Sheppard et al. (2005) observes that when ambient and nonambient sources are independent, exposure va riation due to nonambient source exposures behaves like Berkson measurement error (i.e., statistically independent from the observed variable) and does not bias the effect estimates. A simulation study by Sheppard et al. (2005) also considered attenuati on of the risk based on personal behavior, their microenvironment, a nd qualities of the pollutant in time-series studies. Of particular interest is their finding that significant va riation in nonambient exposure or in ambient source exposure that is independent of ambient concentration does not further bias the effect estimate. In other words, risk estimates were not further attenuated in time-series studies even when the correlations betw een personal exposures and ambient concentrations were weak. In the case of NO 2, there are exposures to nonambient indoor sources to consider. Exposures to nonambient sources are largely inde pendent of ambient expos ures for a number of sources such as exposures associated with c ooking or smoking. However, the relationship August 2007 2-32 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 between exposure to some nonambient sources and to ambient concentrations may not be entirely straightforward. If th e indoor source strength is driven by outdoor parameters that also determine ambient levels, then exposures to th ese sources could be associated with ambient concentrations. For example, use of natural ga s or other fuels for hea ting varies with outdoor temperatures and are a source of nonambient exposures to NO 2. Of course, the contribution to personal exposures from indoor heating depends to a large extent on how efficiently the emissions are vented. Ambient levels will also vary with emissions from local facilities, such as power plants, that respond to changes in temper ature. Indoor sources could also be affecting ambient levels. This situation is found in many areas where there can be trapping of emissions within topographic features. Again, the contribution of the nonambient sources depends largely on how efficiently the emissions are vented. Other complications for NO 2 in the relationship between personal exposures and ambient concentrations include expected strong seasona l variation of personal behaviors and building ventilation practices that can m odify exposure. Also, there may be potential differential errors based on different measurement techniques for ambient and personal measurement. In addition, the relationship may be affected by temperat ure (e.g., high temperature may increase air conditioning use, which may reduce NO 2 penetration indoors), further complicating the role of temperature as a confounder of NO 2 health effects. It should be noted that the pattern of exposure misclassification error and influence of confounders may differ across the outcomes of interest as well as in suscep tible populations and by study design. For example, those who may be suffering from chronic cardiova scular or respiratory conditions may be in a more protective environment (i.e., with less exposure to both NO 2 and its confounders such as temperature and PM) than those who are healthy. As discussed thoroughly in the 2004 PM AQCD (Section 8.4.5), the resulting exposure measurement error and its effect on the estimates of relative risk must be considered to include both Berkson type and classical-type error (i.e., statistically indepe ndent of the true variable). Errors of the classical type arise when a quant ity is measured by some device and repeated measurements vary around the true value. Erro r of the Berkson type is involved when a group's average is assigned to each indi vidual suiting the group's character istics. The group's average is thus the \"measured value,\" that is the value that enters the analysis, a nd the individual latent value is the \"true valu e\" (Heid et al., 2004) August 2007 2-33 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 In theory, there are three components to exposure measurement error in time-series studies as described by Zeger et al. (2000): (1) th e use of average population rather than individual exposure data, (2) the difference be tween average personal ambient exposure and ambient concentrations at central monitoring si tes, and (3) the difference between true and measured ambient concentrations. The first error component, having aggregate rather than individual exposure data, is a Berkson measurement error, wh ich in a simple linear model increases the standard error, but does not bias the risk estimate. The second error component resulting from the difference between average personal ambient exposure and outdoor ambient concentration level has the greatest potential to introduce bias. If the error is of a fixed amount (i.e., absolute differences do not change with increasing concentrations ), there is no bias. However, if the error is not a fixed differe nce, this error will likely attenuate the NO 2 risk estimate, as personal NO 2 exposures are generally lower than ambient NO 2 concentrations in homes without sources while they are higher in homes with sour ces. The third error component, the instrument measurement error in the ambi ent levels, is referred to as nondifferential measurement error and, while unlikely to cause s ubstantial bias, can lead to a bias toward the null. Sheppard (2005) stated that the time-series design is an ecologic study design and, thus, suffers from loss of information (i.e., sources of variation) in the analysis. In air pollution studies, it only uses information about the am bient concentrations, which represent only a fraction of the total personal exposure variation over time and individuals in a population. Thus, there is less power in time-series studies than th ere would be if the time-series design could use all the exposure variation in the population. Sheppard concluded th at the size of the populations that can be feasibly studied in time-series stud ies, even with the lower exposure variation from using only ambient concentration data, overwhelms the benefits of using total personal exposure on a subset of the population in a feasible panel study. Relative to panel studies, time-series studies are immensely more powerfu l, because they can consider all the events over time in entire populations. Interpretation of the results observe d in epidemiological studies using NO 2 measurements from ambient monitoring sites needs to consider the impact of exposure measurement error. Results from a simulation study by Sheppard et al. (2005) seem to suggest that effect estimates were not further biased in tim e-series studies even when the correlations between personal August 2007 2-34 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 exposures and ambient concentrations were weak. Zeger et al. (2000) in dicated that realistic models for estimating air pollution health effect s have elements of both classical and Berkson error models, which generally lead to effect estimates biased toward the null. However, they also noted that when a pollutant with no health effect is correlat ed with at least one pollutant having a nonzero effect, regressi on coefficients can be biased away from the null; that is, positive associations can be observed. 2.5.3 NO 2 as a Component of Mixtures 2.5.3.1 Correlations between Ambient NO 2 and Ambient Copollutants Confounding of NO 2 health effects is often examined at the ambient level, as ambient concentrations are generally used to reflect expo sures in epidemiological studies. The majority of studies examining pollutant a ssociations in the ambient environment have focused on ambient NO 2, PM 2.5 (and its components), and CO, with fewer studies reporting the relationship between ambient NO 2 and ambient O 3 or SO 2. Data were compiled from EPA's Air Quality System and a number of exposure studies. Correlations between ambien t concentrations of NO 2 and other pollutants, PM 2.5 (and its components where available), CO, O 3, and SO 2 are summarized in Table 2.5-7. Mean values of paired, site-wise correlations are shown. As can be seen from the table, NO 2 is moderately correlated with PM 2.5 (range: 0.37 to 0.78) and with CO (0.41 to 0.76) in suburban and urban areas. At locations such as Riverside, CA, associations between ambient NO 2 and ambient CO concentrations (both largely tra ffic-related pollutants) are much lower, likely as the result of other sources of both CO and NO 2 increasing in importance in moving away from the urban core. These sources include oxidation of CH 4 and other biogenic compounds, residential wood burning and prescribed and wild land fires for CO and soil emi ssions, lightning, and residential wood burning and wild land fires for NO 2. In urban areas, the ambient NO 2-CO correlations vary widely. The strongest correlations are seen between NO 2 and elemental carbon. Note that the results of Hochadel et al. (2006) for PM 2.5 optical absorbance have be en interpreted in terms of elemental carbon (EC). Correlations between ambient NO 2 and ambient O 3 are mainly negative, owing to the chemical relation between the two, with agai n considerable variability in the observed correlations. Only one study (Sarna t et al., 2001) examined associations between August 2007 2-35 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 ambient NO 2 and ambient SO 2 concentrations, and it showed a negative correlation during winter. This analysis needs to be extended to other cities. Figures 2.5-4a-d show seasonal pl ots of correlations between NO 2 and O 3 versus correlations between NO 2 and CO. As can be seen from the figures, NO 2 is positively correlated with CO during all seasons at all sites. However, the sign of the correlation of NO 2 with O 3 varies with season, ranging from negative during winter to sli ghtly positive during summer. There are at least two main factors contributi ng to the observed seasonal behavior. Ozone and radicals correlated with it te nd to be higher during the summer, thereby tending to increase the ratio of NO 2 to NO. Nitrogen oxide compounds formed by further the oxidation of NO x are also expected to be correlated with O 3 and increased summertime phot ochemical activity. Because some of these additionally oxidized nitrogen com pounds create a positive ar tifact in the FRM for NO z, they may also tend to increase the correlation of NO 2 with O 3 during the warmer months. A number of case studies show sim ilar correlations between ambient NO 2 and other pollutants presented above. Particulate and gase ous copollutants data were analyzed at 10 sites in St. Louis Regional Air Pollution Study datase t (1975-1977) by Kim et al. (2005). This study examined the spatial variability in source contributions to PM 2.5. Table 2.5-8 shows correlations between NO x and traffic pollutants measured in ambient air. Leaded gasoline was in use at the time , making Pb and Br good markers for motor vehicle exhaust. Motor vehicl e emissions are the main anthropogenic source of CO in urban areas. However, outside of urban areas and aw ay from sources burning fossil fuels, biomass burning and the oxidation of bioge nic hydrocarbons, in particular isoprene and methane, can represent the major source of CO. In general, biogenic emissi ons of precursors to CO formation or CO from biomass burning can cause the relatio nship between CO and motor vehicles to break down. In the Restrepo et al. (2004) study, NO 2 behaved as if traffic wa s its main source, as NO 2 behaved similarly to CO and PM 2.5, i.e., their concentrations d ecreased with height. Ozone showed the opposite vertical gradient, i.e., its co ncentration increased with height.

A time-series mortality study (Wichmann et al., 2000; re-analysis by St \u00f6lzel et al., 2003) conducted in Erfurt, Germany, measured and analyzed ultrafine particle number a nd mass concentrations as well as NO 2. Unlike Seaton and Dennekamp's data, in this data set, the correlation between NO 2 and various number concentration indices were not much stronger than those between PM 2.5 and number concentration indices or those between PM 10 and number concentration indices. For example, the correlation between NC 0.01-0.10 (particle number concentration for particle diameter between 10 and 100 nm) and NO 2, PM 2.5, and PM 10 were 0.66, 0.61, and 0.61, respectively. 2.5.3.2 Correlations of Personal and Ambient NO 2 and Personal and Ambient Copollutants Correlations between ambien t concentrations of NO 2 and personal copollutants, PM 2.5 (and its components where available), CO, O 3, and SO 2 are summarized in Table 2.5-9. Correlations between persona l concentrations of NO 2 and ambient copollutants, PM 2.5 (and its components where available), CO, O 3, and SO 2 are summarized in Table 2.5-10, and correlations between personal NO 2 concentrations and personal copollu tant concentrations are shown in Table 2.5-11. Most studies examined above show that personal NO 2 concentrations are significantly correlated with either ambient or personal level PM 2.5 or other combustion generated pollutants, e.g., CO and EC. As might be expected from a pollutant having a major traffic source, the diurnal cycle of NO 2 in typical urban areas is characterized by traffic emissions, with peaks in emissions occurring during morning and evening rush hour tra ffic. Motor vehicle emissions consist mainly of NO, with only about 10% of prim ary emissions in the form of NO 2. The diurnal pattern of NO and NO 2 concentrations are also st rongly influenced by the diurnal variation in the mixing layer height. Thus, during the morning rush hour when mixing layer heights are still low, traffic produces a peak in NO and NO 2 concentrations. As the mixing layer height increases during the day, dilution of emissions occurs, and NO and NO 2 are converted to NO z. During the afternoon rush hour, mixing layer heights are often still at, or are near, their daily maximum values resulting in dilution of traffic emissions through a larger volume than in the morning. Starting near sunset, the mixing layer height drops and conversion of NO to NO 2 occurs without subsequent photolysis of NO 2 recreating NO.

Fi gure 2.5-5 shows that lowest hourly median concentrations are typically found at ar ound midday and that highest hourly median concentrations are found either in the early morn ing or in mid-evening. Median values range by about a factor of two from about 13 ppb to about 25 ppb.

In this regard, NO 2 behaves as a primary pollutant, although there is no good reason to suspect strong seasonal variations in its emissions. 2.6 DOSIMETRY OF INHALED NITROGEN OXIDES 5 This section provides a brief overview of NO 2 dosimetry and updates information provided in the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitr ogen. A more extensive discussion of NO 2 dosimetry appears in Annex 4. Nitrogen dioxide, classified as a reactive gas, interacts with surfactants, antioxidants, and other compounds in the epitheli al lining fluid (ELF). The compounds thought to be responsible for a dverse pulmonary effects of inhaled NO 2 are the reaction products themselves or the metabolites of these products in the ELF. Acute NO 2 uptake in the lower respir atory tract is thought to be rate-limited by chemical reactions of NO 2 with ELF constituents rather than by gas solubility in the ELF (Postlethwait and Bidani, 1990). Postlethwait and Bidani ( 1994) concluded that th e reaction between NO 2 and water does not significantly contribute to the absorption of inhaled NO 2. Rather, uptake is a first-order process for NO 2 concentrations of <10 ppm, is aqueous substrate-dependent, and is saturable. Postlethwait et . (1991) reported that inhaled NO 2 (<10 ppm) does not penetrate the ELF to reach underlying site s and suggested that cytoto xicity may be due to NO 2 reactants formed in the ELF. Related to the balance be tween reaction product formation and removal, it was further suggested that cellular responses may be nonlinear with greater responses being possible at low levels of NO 2 uptake versus higher levels of uptake. Ascorbate and glutathione (GSH) are the primary NO 2 absorption substrates in rat ELF (Postlethwait et al., 1995). Velsor and Postleth wait (1997) investigated th e mechanisms of acute epithelial injury from NO 2 exposure. Membrane oxidation wa s not a simple monotonic function of GSH and ascorbic acid levels. The maximal levels of membrane oxidation were observed at low antioxidant levels versus null or high antioxi dant levels. Glutathi one and ascorbic acid- related membrane oxidation were superoxide and hydrogen peroxide de pendent, respectively. The authors suggested that increased absorption of NO 2 occurred at the higher antioxidant concentrations, but little secondary oxidation of the membrane occurred because the reactive species (e.g., superoxide and hydr ogen peroxide) generated during absorption were quenched. A lower rate of NO 2 absorption occurred at the low antioxida nt concentrations, but oxidants were not quenched and so were available to interact with the cell membrane. Illustrating the complex August 2007 2-40 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE interaction of antioxidants, some studies suggest that NO 2-oxidized GSH may be again reduced by uric acid and/or ascorbic acid (Ke lly et al., 1996; Kelly and Tetley, 1997). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Very limited work related to the quantification of NO 2 uptake has been reported since the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen. In both humans and animals, the uptake of NO 2 uptake by the upper respiratory tract decreas es with increasing ve ntilator rates. This causes a greater proportion of inhaled NO 2 to be delivered to the lower respiratory tract. In humans, the breathing pattern shifts from nasal to oronasal du ring exercise relative to rest. Since the nasal passages absorb more inhaled NO 2 than the mouth, exercise (with respect to the resting state) delivers a disproportionately great er quantity of the inhaled mass to the pulmonary region of the lung, where the NO 2 is readily absorbed. Bauer et al. (1986) reported a statistically significant increase in uptake from 72% during rest to 87% during exercise in a group of 15 asthmatic adults. The minute ventilation also increased from 8.1 L/min during rest to 30.4 L/min during exercise. Hence, exercise increased the dose rate of NO 2 by 5-fold in these subjects. Similar results have been reported for b eagle dogs where the dose rate of NO 2 was 3-fold greater for the dogs during exercise than rest (Kleinman and Mautz, 1991). 2.7 INDOOR AND PERSONAL EX POSURE HEALTH STUDIES At the time of the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen, many of th e available health effects studies consisted predominately of indoor NO 2 exposure studies. Although indoor sources in these studies include both gas-fueled cooking and heati ng appliances, in most of the older studies the focus was primarily on cooking stoves. Indoor studies evaluated in the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen include Neas et al. (1991), Dijkstra et al. (1990), Ekwo et al. (1983), Ware et al. (1984), Me lia et al. (1977, 1979, 1982a,b, 1990), and Keller et al. (1979a,b). Indoor studies examining children 2 years ol d or younger include Same t et al. (1993, 1992), Ogston et al. (1985), and Margolis et al. (1992). Available ou tdoor studies with ambient NO 2 measures include Dockery et al. (1989), Braun-Fahrlaender et al. ( 1992), Schwartz (1989), Schwartz et al. (1991), Schwartz and Zeger (1990), and Vedal et al. (1987). Although there was some evidence suggesting that increased NO 2 exposure was associated with increased respiratory symptoms in children aged 5 to 12 years, the main conclusion was that there was insufficient epidemiological evidence for an association be tween short-term exposure and health effects. August 2007 2-41 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 2.7.1 Recent Indoor Studies of Exposu res to Nitrogen Oxides and Heath Outcomes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 These studies consist of NO 2 exposures that may differ from ambient exposure in relation to pattern, levels, and associated copollutants (see Annex Table AX6.1 for details). Samet and Bell (2004) state that, while \"evidence from st udies of outdoor air pollution cannot readily isolate an effect of NO 2 because of its contribution to the formation of secondary particles and ozone, observational studies of exposure i ndoors can test hypothesis related to NO 2 specifically although confounding by combustion sources in th e home is a concern.\" Thus, indoor NO 2 sources are not likely confounded by othe r ambient pollutants such as PM, O 3, CO, and SO 2. Most of the studies conducted since 1993 have taken place in Australia and attempted to capture indoor exposures (with passive diffusion badges) from bot h cooking and heating sources in homes and schools (Pilotto et al., 1997a, 2004; Garrett et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2000). Several indoor exposure studies ha ve also been conducted in Europe (Farrow et al., 1997; Simoni et al., 2002, 2004), one in Singapore (Ng et al., 2001), and one cohort study in the United States (Belanger et al., 2006; van Strien et al., 2004). The key results from these studies are summarized in the Annex Table AX6.1. These incl ude one key intervention study (Pilotto et al., 2004) that provides strong evidence of a detrimenta l effect of exposure to indoor levels of NO 2. Pilotto et al. (2004) conducted a randomized intervention study of respiratory symptoms of asthmatic children in Australia before and afte r selective replacement of unflued gas heaters in schools. In the study, 18 schools using unflued gas heaters were ra ndomly allocated to have an electric heater (n = 4) or a flue d gas heater (n = 4) installed or to retain their original heaters (n = 10). Changes to the heating systems were di sguised as routine maintenance to prevent bias in reporting of symptoms. Children were eligible for the study if they had physician-diagnosed asthma and no unflued heater in their homes. For the 114 children enrolled, symptoms were recorded daily and reported in fortnightly tele phone interviews during 12 weeks in the winter. Passive diffusion badges were used to measure NO 2 exposure in classrooms (6 h/day) and in the children's homes. Schools in the intervention gr oup (with new heaters) averaged with overall means (SD) of 15.5 (6.6) ppb NO 2, while control schools (with unflued heaters) averaged 47.0 (26.8) ppb. Exposure to NO 2 in the children's homes was quite variable but with similar mean levels. Levels at homes for the intervention group were 13.7 (19.3) ppb, and 14.6 (21.5) ppb for the control group. Children a ttending intervention schools had significant August 2007 2-42 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 reductions in several symptoms: difficulty breathing during the day (rate ratio [RR] = 0.41 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.98]) and = 0.32 [9 5% CI: 0.14, 0.69]); chest tightness during the day (RR = 0.45 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.81]) and at night (RR = 0.59 [95% CI: 0.28, 1.29]); and asthma attacks during the day (RR = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.93]). Samet and Bell (2004) state that Pilotto et al. (2004) provides persuasive evidence of an association between exposure to NO 2 from in-class heaters and the respiratory health of children with asthma and further that the study provides evidence from an intervention and, thus, avoids some potential limitations at obs ervational studies. The two groups of children studied had similar baseline characteristics. In addition, the concentrations in the home environment were similar for the two groups, implying that expo sure at school was likel y to be the primary determinant of a difference in indoor NO 2 exposure between the two groups. Samet and Utell (1990) concluded that, the \"abse nce of significant differences between the groups for lung function tests and bronchial res ponsiveness are consiste nt with the majority of chamber study results.\" In an earlier study of the hea lth effects of unflued gas heat ers on wintertime respiratory symptoms of 388 Australian schoolchildren, Pilotto et al. (1997a) measured NO 2 in 41 classrooms in 8 schools, with half using unflued gas heaters and half using electric heat. Although similar methods were used to measure NO 2 levels (passive diffusion badge monitors exposed for 6 h at a time), there were three major differences between this study and the 2003 study: (1) the 1997 study was not a randomized tr ial, (2) enrollment was not restricted to asthmatic children, and (3) enrollment was not rest ricted to children from homes without unflued gas heaters. In Pilotto et al. (1997a), only ch ildren from nonsmoking homes were enrolled and a subset of children (n = 121) liv ing in homes with unflued gas heaters were given badges to be used at home. Symptoms were recorded daily by each child's parents. Children were classified into low- and high-exposure gr oups based on their measured expos ure at school, their measured exposure at home (if they lived in homes with unflued gas heater s), or their reported use of electric heat at home. Ma ximum hourly concentration in these classrooms each day over 2 weeks of hourly monitoring were highly correlated with their corresponding 6-h concentrations measured over the same 2 weeks (r = 0.85). Hourly peaks of NO 2 of the order of $80 ppb were associated with 6-h average levels of approximately $40 ppb. They inferred that children in classrooms with gas heaters that had 6-h average levels of $40 ppb were experiencing August 2007 2-43 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 approximately 4-fold or higher 1- h peaks of exposure than the NO 2 levels experienced by children who had no gas exposure (6-h average le vels of 20 ppb). The importance of this study is that it examines the effect of repeated peaks over time as have been used in toxicological infectivity studies (e.g., Miller et al., 1987). Pilotto et al. (1997a) report that during the winter heating season, children in the high exposure category (NO 2 > 40 ppb) had higher rates of sore thro at, colds, and absenteeism than all other children. In models adjusted for persona l risk factors including asthma, allergies, and geographic area, classroom NO 2 level and school absence were significantly associated (odds ratio [OR] = 1.92 [95% CI: 1.13, 3.25]). Incr eased likelihood i ndividual respiratory symptoms was not significantly asso ciated with classroom level of NO 2 (e.g., cough with phlegm: adjusted OR = 1.28 (95% CI: 0.76, 2.15). Dose-response relations hips are illustrated in Figure 2.7-1 for symptom rates for cough and in Figure 2.7-2 for school absence. Pilotto et al. (1997b) notes that this study \"provides evidence that short-term exposure to the peak levels of NO 2 produced by unflued gas appliances affects resp iratory health and that the significant dose- response relationship seen with increasing NO 2 exposure strengthens th e evidence for a cause- effect relationship.\" One recent birth cohort study in the United States measured indoor exposure to NO 2 (Belanger et al., 2006; van Strien et al., 2004). Fam ilies were eligible for this study if they had a child with physician-diagnosed as thma (asthmatic sibling) and a newborn infant (birth cohort subject). NO 2 levels were measured using Palmes tubes left in the homes for 2 weeks. Higher levels of NO 2 were measured in homes with gas stoves (mean [SD], 26 [18] ppb) than in homes with electric ranges (9 [9] ppb). Children livi ng in multifamily homes were exposed to more NO 2 (23 [17] ppb) than children in single-family homes (10 [12] ppb). The authors examined associations between NO 2 concentrations and respiratory symptoms experienced by the asthmatic sibling in the month prior to sampli ng (Belanger et al., 2005). For children living in multifamily homes, each 20-ppb increase in NO 2 concentration increase d the likelihood of any wheeze or chest tightness (OR for wheeze = 1.52 [95% CI: 1.04, 2.21]; OR for chest tightness = 1.61 [95% CI: 1.04, 2.49]) as well as in creasing the risk of su ffering additional days of symptoms. No signifi cant associations were found between level of NO 2 and symptoms for children living in single-family homes. The auth ors suggested that the low levels of exposure may have been responsible for the lack of associ ation observed in single-family homes.

Although wheeze was not associated with NO 2 concentration, persistent cough was associated with increasing NO 2 concentration in a dose-response re lationship as shown in Figure 2.7-3 (van Strien et al., 2004). An important consideration in the eval uation of these study results is that NO x is part of a complex mixture of chemicals emitted from unven ted gas heaters. In addition to NO and NO 2, indoor combustion sources such as unvented gas h eaters emit other pollutant s that are present in the fuel or are formed during combustion. The major products from the combustion of natural gas are carbon dioxide (CO 2) and CO followed by HCHO with smaller amounts of other oxidized organic compounds in the gas phase. In a study of pollutants emitted by unvented gas heaters, Brown et al. (2004) found that CO in a room test chamber ranged from 1 to 18 ppm for August 2007 2-45 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Figure 2.7-2.

(2000) concluded that particulate mass emissions from natural gas heaters are low but that natural gas heaters are larger sources of organic compounds, such as HCHO. They also measured emission rates for individual particles, which are exp ected to be present mainly in the ultrafine size range, but concluded that thes e rates are low and they could not detect an increase in particle number from one of the tw o model heaters tested. However, Rogge et al. (1993) found that at least 22% of the fine partic le mass emitted by natural ga s heaters consists of PAHs, oxy-PAHs, and aza-and thia-arenes.

These studies can serve as a bridge between epidemiological studies and controlled human exposure studies, as noted above, and provide some evidence of coherence for respiratory effects. As is true for NO x in the ambient air, indoor NO x concentrations may be correlated with a mixture of other pollutants. The major products of combustion of natural gas include CO 2 and CO, followed by HCHO, with sma ller amounts of other oxidized organic compounds in the gas phase and sub-micrometer PM whose major identifiable components are PAHs, possibly complicating the interpretation of associations between health effects and indoor NO 2 levels.

Personal exposure to NO 2 and the severity of virus-induced asthma (Chauhan et al., 2003), including risk of airflow obstruction (Linaker et al., 2000) was studied in a group of 114 asthmatic children in England. Children were supplied with Palmes diffusion tubes, whic h they clipped to their clothing during the day and placed in the bedroom at night. Tubes were changed every week for the duration of the 13-month study period. Nasal aspirates were obtained and analyzed for a variety of respiratory-illness causing viruses (Chauhan et al., 2003). The authors found significant increases in the 4 point symptom severity score associated with exposure to NO 2 levels greater than 14 \u00b5g/m3 (7.4 ppb) in the week preceding any viral infect ion (score increase of 0.6 [95% CI: 0.01, 1.18]) or respiratory syncytial virus of 2.1 [95% CI: 0.52, 3.81]). Chauhan et al. 2003 also found a significan t reduction in PEF associated with exposure greater than 14 \u00b5g/m3 (by 12 L/min [95% CI: !23.6, !0.80]). Exploration of the relationship between PEF and NO 2 showed that the risk of a PE F episode (as diagnosed by a clin ician's review of each child's PEF data) beginning within a week of a upper resp iratory infection was significantly associated with exposure to NO 2 greater than 28 \u00b5g/m3 (14.9 ppb) (RR = 1.9 [95% CI: 1.1, 3.4]) (Linaker et al., 2000). See Figure 2.7-4. Thus, high personal NO 2 exposure in the week before an upper respiratory infection was associated with either increased severity of lower-respiratory-tract symptoms or reduction of PEF for all virus types together and for two of the common respiratory viruses, C picornavirus and RSV, individually. Nitschke et al. (2006) used passi ve diffusion badges for measuring NO 2 exposures in 6-h increments at home and school for 174 asthmatic children in Australi a. School and home measurements were based on 3 consecutive days of sampling. The maximum of 9 days of sampling (for 6 h each day) NO 2 value was selected as the representative daily exposure for dose-response analyses. Children kept a daily record of respir atory symptoms for the 12-week study period. Significant associations were found between the maximum NO 2 level at school or home and respiratory symptom rates (see Annex Table AX 6-1). The dose response relationship is illustrated in Figure 2.7-5. In a cross-sectional survey of 344 children in Australia , Ponsonby et al.

Of the health outcomes measured (recent wheeze, asthma ever, lung function measured when NO 2 sampling stopped), only the FEV 1/FVC ratio following cold air challenge was significantly associated with NO 2 levels measured with the personal badges ( !0.12 [95% CI: !0.23, !0.01]) per 1 ppb increase in personal exposure).

There is convincing eviden ce for a direct effect of NO 2 exposure on respiratory health from the randomized interven tion study by Pilotto et al . (2003) and from other studies enrolling asthmatic childr en (Pilotto et al., 1997; Nitschke et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2000; Belanger et al., 2006). From indoor and persona l exposure studies, effects observed in these studies all occurred at ambient levels and are relatively unc onfounded by copollutants found in ambient air that make unambiguous interpretatio n of many of the health effects studies of ambient exposure problematic. Chauhan et al. (2003) shows an association between increased personal exposure to NO 2 and the severity of virus-induced asthma exacerbations in children. The study design reduced potential bias from misclassification of other pollutant exposure or health outcomes. As is true for NO 2 in the ambient air, indoor NO 2 concentrations may be correlated with a mixture of other pollutants, as the major products of combustion of natural gas includes CO 2, CO, and HCHO, along with smaller amounts of other oxidized organic compounds in the gas phase and sub-micrometer PM, particul arly PAHs, thus complicating the interpretation of associations between h ealth effects and indoor NO 2 levels. Nonetheless, the findings of these recent indoor and personal exposure studies, combin ed with studies availa ble in the previous AQCD, provide strong evidence that NO 2 exposure is associated with respiratory effects. These studies can serve as a bridge between epidemio logical studies and cont rolled human exposure studies, as noted above, and pr ovide some evidence of cohere nce for respiratory effects.

The body of epidemiological and expe rimental evidence is evaluated for strength, consistency, coherence, and plau sibility. Judgments are made about the extent to which causal inferences can be made on the observed associat ions between health effects and exposure to oxides of nitrogen. The focus is on studies conducted at environmentally relevant concentrations, i.e., primar ily studies that identify effects associated with NO 2 levels #5 ppm. The evaluations of those studi es incorporate the science a nd conclusions from the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen. More detailed informa tion is summarized in the Annexes, highlighting key study findings. The chapter first presents a br ief overview of the toxicological evidence for potential mechanisms of injury. Morbidity and mo rtality associated with short-term exposures to NO 2 are presented next, followed by morbidity and mortality associat ed with long-term exposures. The chapter concludes with discussi ons of the limited literature on health effects associated with other oxides of n itrogen, including NO, HONO, and HNO 3. Issues relevant to the evaluation of epid emiological study findings were discussed in previous documents, particularly in the AQCDs for PM (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004) and O 3 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2006). These include the influence of model specification on study findings, the evaluati on of lag periods used in epidemiological analyses, and general considera tions regarding confounding or eff ect modification. In evaluating NO 2 epidemiological studies, the consideration of measurement and exposure errors are of particular relevance. Chapter 2 describes the extent and significance of the positive artifacts from other oxidized nitrogen compounds in the FRM-reported NO 2 values found in standard regulatory networks. Because nearly all ep idemiological studies use FRM-reported NO 2 as the population exposure estimates, these estimates repr esent the effects of ot her oxidized nitrogen compounds in addition to NO 2.

Asthmatics and COPD patients demonstrated increased decrements in lung functi on that were dependent on exposure conditions. However, concentration-response relationships we re not observed for changes in lung function, airways responsiveness, or symptoms, and no as sociation was apparent between lung function responses and respiratory symptoms. Epidemiological evidence was somewhat mixed for the effects of NO 2 exposure on lower respiratory symptoms and disease, but supportive for effects in children aged 5 to 12 years. However, at th e time, data were inadequate to determine a quantitative relationship between estimates of exposure and symptoms. There was similarly insufficient epidemiological evidence regard ing the long- or short-term effects of NO 2 on pulmonary function. Animal toxicology st udies evaluated in the 1993 AQCD identified biochemical and cellular mechanisms whereby NO 2 induces effects. The ability of NO 2 to modulate host defenses and enhan ce susceptibility to bacterial and viral disease was attributed to alterations in alveolar macropha ge (AM) structure, function, a nd metabolic activity. Animal infectivity models also demonstrat ed decreased resistance to bacter ial infections associated with NO 2 exposure. Analysis of exposure regimens showed the dependence of effects on the concentration and duration and the exposure prof ile, rather than the cumulative product of concentration times dura tion of exposure (C H T). 3.1 POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF INJURY The effects of NO 2 on respiratory tract function acc ount for most of the currently available literature relevant to this evaluation of the effects of gaseous NO x, and the evidence includes a variety of endpoints ranging from bioc hemical effects to morp hological and functional changes. Limited relevant data are available fo r effects of other gaseous oxides of nitrogen, such as NO and HNO 3 vapor. This evidence is briefly discu ssed in Section 3.7 with further details available in Annex Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Biochemical studies on the effects of NO 2 on the lung focus on the possible mechanism(s) of toxicity and/or on detection of indicators of tissue and cellular damage. The biochemical effects observed in the respiratory tract after NO 2 exposure include chemical alteration of lipids, amino acids, proteins, a nd enzymes and changes in oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis.

These effects appear to occur at concentrations as low as 0.04 ppm. Another li kely mechanism involves the oxidation of water- soluble low-molecular-weight reducing substances and proteins, resulting in enzyme dysfunction that manifests itself as toxicity (Freeman and Mudd, 1981). Mechanisms of respiratory tract toxicity may relate to NO 2 metabolites or reaction products resu lting in local pH changes or to direct damage to target cells via reactive me tabolites. The underlying mechanisms are complex, because their effects may occu r directly through the action of nitrogen or oxygen radicals generated via NO 2-mediated chemical reactions or may be secondary to release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by leukocytes responding to lo cal irritation caused by cell damage. For a detailed description of mechan ism studies, see Annex Chapter 4. 3.2 MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT-TERM NO 2 EXPOSURE 3.2.1 Respiratory Effects A ssociated with Short-Term NO 2 Exposure 3.2.1.1 Lung Host Defenses and Immunity Lung host defenses are sensitive to NO 2 exposure, with numerous measures of such effects observed at concentrations of <1 ppm. According to Chauhan et al. (2003), potential mechanisms include \"direct effects on the upper and lower airways by ciliary dyskinesis (Carson et al., 1993), epithelial damage (D evalia et al., 1993a), increases in pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines (Devalia et al., 1993b), rises in IgE concentration (Sie gel et al., 1997), and interaction with allergens (Tunni cliffe et al., 1994), or indir ectly through bronchial immunity (Sandstrom et al., 1992).\" Table 3.2-1 summarizes a range of proposed mechanisms by which exposure to NO 2 in conjunction with viral infections may exacerbate upper and lower airways symptoms (Chauhan et al., 1998). A major concern has been the potential for NO 2 exposure to enhance susceptibility to, or the severity of, illness resulting from respiratory infections and asthma, especially in children. The following discussion focuses on studies published since the 1993 AQCD and conducte d at near-ambient exposure concentrations. August 2007 3-3 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 One new epidemiological field study (Chauha n et al., 2003) discussed in Section 2.7 provided evidence that increased personal exposure to NO 2 worsens virus-associated symptoms and lung function in children with asthma. Pers onal exposure concentrations were low, with medians for the exposure quartiles ranging from 2.6 to 10.9 ppb. These concentrations are at least 2 orders of magnitude lo wer than the lowest concentrat ions demonstrated to have measurable effects on airways inflammation in asso ciation with allergen challenge in clinical studies. Differences that can influence the interaction of NO 2 and infectious agents include exercise (Illing et al., 1980), the presence of O3 (Ehrlich et al., 1977; Gardner, 1980; Gardner et al., 1982; Graham et al., 1987), and elevat ed temperatures (Gardner et al., 1982). Several clinical studies have attempte d to address the question of whether NO 2 exposures impaired host defenses and/or in creased susceptibility to inf ection and produced mixed results (Rehn et al., 1982; Goings et al., 1989; al., 2002: from Samet and Bell, 2004, review) (see the 1993 AQCD for details of older studies and Anne x Table AX5-1 for additional details on newer studies). One approach has been to examine the effects of in vivo NO 2 exposure on the function of AMs obtained by bronchoalveola r lavage, including the susceptib ility of these cells to viral infection in vitro. Two studi es since 1993 involved 2.0-ppm NO 2 exposures for 4 or 6 h with intermittent exercise and found no effect on AM inactivation of influenza virus either immediately or 18 h after exposure (Azadniv et al., 1998; Devlin et al., 1999). However, the Devlin et al. (1999) study found redu ced AM phagocytic capacity after NO 2 exposure, suggesting a reduced ability to clear inhaled bacteria or other inf ectious agents. Frampton et al. (2002) examined NO 2 effects on viral infectivity of airways epithelial cells. Subjects were exposed to air, or 0.6- or 1.5-ppm NO 2 for 3 h, and bronchoscopy was performed 3.5 h after exposure. Epithelial cells were harvested from the airways by brushing and then challenged in vitro with influenza virus and resp iratory syncytial virus (RSV). NO 2 exposure did not alter viral infectivity, but appeared to enhance epithelial cell in jury in response to infection with RSV (p = 0.024). Similar results were seen with infl uenza virus. These findings suggest that prior exposure to NO 2 may increase the susceptibility of the respiratory epithelium to injury by subsequent viral challenge. Over all results from clinical studies are equivocal but suggestive of the potential for NO 2 effects. August 2007 3-4 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Animal studies provide clearer evidence that host defense system components such as mucociliary transport and AMs (see Annex Tabl es AX.4.3 and 4.4) are targets for inhaled NO 2. Animal studies further show that NO 2 can impair the respiratory hos t defense system sufficiently to render the host more susceptible to respiratory infections (See Annex Table 4.5). Ciliated epithelial cells involved in mucociliary transport in the conducting airways exhibit morphological changes at NO 2 concentration as low as 0.5 ppm with 7 months of exposure (Yamamoto and Takahashi, 1984). However, mu cociliary clearance is not affected by NO 2 exposure as low as 3 ppm. In a 1994 study, exposu re of guinea pigs to 5640- or 16,920-\u00b5g/m3 (3 or 9 ppm) NO 2 6 h/day, 6 days/week for 2 weeks re sulted in concentration-dependent decreases in ciliary activity of 12 and 30% of control values at NO 2 concentrations of 5640 \u00b5g/m3 (3 ppm) and 16,920 \u00b5g/m3 et al., 1994). These concentration-dependent decreases are accompan ied by a concentration-dependent increase in eosinophil accumulation on the epithelium and submuc osal connective tissue layer of the nasal mucosa. For foreign agents such as some bacteria and viruses that deposit below the mucociliary region in the gas-exchange region of the lung, AMs primarily provide host defenses by acting to remove or kill viable particles, remove nonviable particles, and process and present antigens to lymphocytes for antibody production. AMs are one of the sensitive targets for NO 2, as evidenced by in vivo acute and long-term anim al exposures and in vitro studies (see Annex Table AX4.4 for details of studies related to each of these morphological or functional parameters in exposed animals). The susceptibility to bacterial and viral pulmonary infections in animals also increases with NO 2 exposures of as low as 0.5 ppm. No new studies published since 1993 were identified that evaluated this endpoint. Annex Table AX4.5 summarizes the effects of NO 2 exposure and infectious agents in animal studies as compiled in the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen. It is important to note that the 1993 AQCD provi des evidence that the host's response to inhaled NO 2 can be significantly influenc ed by the duration and temporal patterns of exposure. This is important in cons idering continuous versus intermittent exposures and attempting to understanding observed differences in reported results. In summary, the evidence for altered host defense is coherent across disciplines and plausible. Taken as a whole, however, the body evidence lacks consistency and robustness. The epidemiologic, clinical, and animal data prov ide supportive evidence of impaired host-defense systems and increased risk of susceptibility to bo th viral and bacterial infe ctions. In particular, August 2007 3-5 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 the Pilotto et al. (2004) and the Chauhan et al. (2003) studies a dd to the weight of evidence produced since the last AQCD. Their findings indicate th at exposure to NO 2 before the start of a respiratory infection is associated with an in crease in respiratory symptoms and exacerbation of asthma. These effects are reported to occur at levels near and below the current NAAQS. These indoor/personal NO 2-exposure studies all were controlled for some variable associated with ambient NO 2 exposure; however, confounding with ul trafine emissions remains a concern. Clinical Studies on Host Defense and Immunity Clinical studies have attempted to address the question of whether NO 2 exposure increases susceptibility to inf ection. Goings et al. (1989) expo sed healthy volunteers to either 1- to 3 ppm NO 2 or to air for 2 h/day for 3 consecutive days. A live, genetically engineered influenza A vaccine virus was administered intranasally to all subjects after exposure on day 2. Infection was determined by virus recovery from nasal washings, a 4-fold or greater increase in antibody titer, or both. The findings of this st udy were inconclusive, in part, because of limitations in sample size. In addition, the attenuated, cold-adapted viru s used in the study was incapable of infecting the lower respiratory tract, where NO 2 may have the most important impact on host defense. There is evidence from both animal a nd human studies that exposure to NO 2 may alter lymphocyte subsets in the lung and possibly in th e blood. Lymphocytes, part icularly T cells and NK cells, play a key role in the innate immune system and host defense against respiratory viruses. Sandstr\u00f6m et al. (1990, 1991) observe d a significant, dose-re lated increase in lymphocytes and mast cells recovered by bronc hoalveolar lavage (BAL) 24-h after a 20-min exposure to NO 2 at 2.25 to 5.5 ppm. Rubinstein et al. ( 1991) found that a series of 4 daily, 2-h exposures to 0.60 ppm NO 2 resulted in a small increase in NK cells recovered by BAL. In contrast, repeated exposu res to 1.5- or 4 ppm NO 2 for 20 min every second day on six occasions resulted in decreased CD16+56+ (NK cells) and CD19+ cells (B lymphocytes) in BAL fluid, 24-h after the final exposure (Sandstr\u00f6m et al., 1992a,b ). No effects were seen on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) or total lymphocyte numbers. Solomon et al. (2000) found a decrease in CD4+ T lymphocytes in BAL fl uid 18-h after 4 daily, 4-h exposures to 2.0 ppm NO 2. Azadniv et al. (1998) observed a small but significant reduction in CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood, but not BAL, 18-h following si ngle 6-h exposures to 2.0 ppm NO 2. Frampton et al. August 2007 3-6 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 (2002) found small increases in BAL lymphocytes and decreases in blood lymphocytes with exposures to 0.6 and 1.5 ppm NO 2 for 3 h. The observed effects on lymphocyte responses , as described above, have not been consistent among studies. Differing exposure pr otocols and small numbers of subjects among these studies may explain the va rying and conflicting findings. Furthermore, the clinical significance of transient, small changes in lymphocyte subsets is unclear. It is possible that the inflammatory response to NO 2 exposure involves both lymphocytes and PMNs, with lymphocyte responses occurring transiently and at lower c oncentrations and PMN responses predominating at higher concentrations or more prolonged e xposures. The airways lymphocyte responses do not provide convincing evidence of impairment in host defense. One study found that 20-min exposures to NO 2 at 1.5 to 3.5 ppm transiently reduced airways mucociliary activity, assessed by fiber optic bronchoscopy (Helleday et al., 1995). Reduced mucus clearance would be expected to increase susceptibility to infection by reducing the removal rate of microorganisms from airway s. However, the study was weakened by a lack of a true air control e xposure as well as by the absence of randomization and blinding. As a clarification, Helleday et al . (1995) did not measure mucus clearance rates directly using radiolabeled particles; rather th ey utilized an optical technique to characterize ci liary activity. Rehn et al. (1982) examined the effect of NO 2 exposure on mucociliary clearance of a radiolabeled Teflon aerosol. After a 1-h e xposure to either 0.27- or 1.06-ppm (500 or 2000 \u00b5g/m3) NO 2, there were no changes in airways clearance rates. Another approach has been to examine the effects of in vivo NO 2 exposure on the function of AMs obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage , including the susceptibility of these cells to viral infection in vitro. Several NO 2 exposure scenarios, including continuous low-level exposure or intermittent peak exposures have been examined (Frampton et al., 1989). AMs obtained by BAL 3.5-h after a 3-h co ntinuous exposure to 0.60 ppm NO 2 tended to inactivate influenza virus in vitro less effectively than cells collected after air expos ure. The effect was observed in cells from 4 of the 9 subjects studied; AMs from these 4 subjects increased release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) after exposure to NO 2, whereas cells from the remaining 5 subjects decreased release of IL-1 following exposure. However, two subs equent studies (Azadniv et al., 1998; Devlin et al., 1999) involving 2.0 ppm NO 2 exposures for 4 or 6 h, with intermittent exercise, found no effect on AM inactivation of influenza virus either immediately or 18-h after August 2007 3-7 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 exposure. However, the Devlin et al. (1999) study found reduced AM phagocytic capacity after NO 2 exposure, suggesting a reduced ab ility to clear inhaled bacteria or other infectious agents. Frampton et al. (2002) examined NO 2 effects on viral infectivity of airways epithelial cells. Subjects were exposed to air, or 0.6- or 1.5-ppm NO 2 for 3 h, and bronchoscopy was performed 3.5-h after exposure. Epithelial cells were harveste d from the airways by brushing and then challenged in vitro with influenza virus and respirat ory syncytial virus (RSV). NO 2 exposure did not alter viral infec tivity, but appeared to enhance ep ithelial cell injury in response to infection with RSV (p = 0.024). A similar nonsignificant change was seen with influenza virus. These findings suggest that prior exposure to NO 2 may increase the susceptibility of the respiratory epithelium to injury by subsequent viral challenge. Toxicological Studies on Host Defense and Immunity Mucociliary Clearance Substances capable of disrupting or impairi ng mucociliary clearance can result in an excess accumulation of cellular secr etions, increased acute bacteria l and viral infections, chronic bronchitis, and prolonged pulmonary complications (Schlesinger et al., 1987). The respiratory tract often responds to irritants by increasing mucus secretion. Ideally, this would enhance the capture of harmful substances to be removed to the upper respiratory tract through the action of the ciliated epithelium. The cili ated epithelial cells lining the re spiratory tract (tracheobronchial region) can respond to insults by changing cilia beat frequenc y, cessation of beating, and/or development of abnormal forms of cilia. With ev en greater exposures, loss of cilia and ciliated epithelial cells can be found in animals exposed to NO 2, and a description of such histopathologic changes can be found in th e Section 3.2.1.1 on morphological changes. Changes in the functional impairment of mucociliary clearance are observed at high concentrations of NO 2 ($5.0 ppm) (Giordano and Morrow, 1 972; Kita and Omichi, 1974). At lower exposures (2 h/day for 2, 7, and 14 days to 564- and 1880-\u00b5g/m3 [0.3 and 1.0 ppm] NO 2), the mucociliary clearance of inha led tracer particles deposited in the tracheobronchial tree of rabbits was not altered (Schlesing er et al., 1987). Vollmuth et al. (1986) studied the clearance of strontium-85-radiolabelled polystyrene latex sphe res from the lungs of rabbits following a single 2-h exposure to NO 2 at 564, 1880, 5640, or 18,800 \u00b5g/m3 (0.3, 1.0, ppm). An acceleration in clearance occu rred immediately after exposure to the two lowest NO 2 August 2007 3-8 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 concentrations; a similar effect was found by Schlesinger and Gearhart (1987). At the higher levels of NO 2, acceleration in clearance was not ev ident until midway through the 14-day postexposure period. Repeated exposure for 14 days (2 h/day) to 1880- or 18,800-\u00b5g/m3 (1.0 or 10.0 ppm) NO 2 produced a response similar to a single exposure at the same concentration. Exposure of guinea pigs to 5640- or 16,920-\u00b5g/m3 (3 or 9 ppm) NO 2 6 h/day, 6 days/week for 2 weeks resulted in concentratio n-dependent decreases in ciliary activity of 12 and 30% of control values at NO 2 concentrations of 5640 \u00b5g/m3 (3 ppm) and 16,920 \u00b5g/m3 (9 ppm), respectively, et al., 1994) accompanied by concentration-dependent increase in eosinophil accumulation on the epithelium and connective tissue compound cilia, cytoplasmic vacuolization, sloughing) were observed only in the nose of anim als in the high-concentration group. Effects on AMs and Mast Cells The effectiveness of AMs depends on the type, number, and viability of the cells. To perform their primary function of detoxifying and/or clearing the lung of infectious and noninfectious particles, AMs must maintain an intact membrane, mobility, and phagocytic activity, and have functioning enzy me systems as well as secrete cellular mediators that recruit and activate inflammatory cells in the lungs (F els and Cohn, 1986). AMs are one of the sensitive targets for NO 2, as evidenced by in vivo acute and long- term animal exposures and in vitro studies, and there are studies (see Annex Table AX 4.4) related to each of these morphological or functional parameters in exposed animals. Structural changes, including the loss of surface processes, appearance of fenestrae, bleb formation, and denuded surface areas, have b een observed in AMs isolated from mice continuously exposed to 3760-\u00b5g/m3 (2.0 ppm) NO 2 or to 940-\u00b5g/m3 (0.5 ppm) NO 2 continuously with a 1-h peak to 3760 \u00b5g/m3 (2.0 ppm) for 5 days/week. The AMs showed distinctive morphological changes af ter 21 weeks of exposure that w ould be expected to interfere with cellular functions such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis (A ranyi et al., 1976). Continuous exposure to lower NO 2 concentrations, i.e., to 940 \u00b5g/m3 (0.5 ppm) continuous or to 1.8 \u00b5g/m3 (0.1 ppm) continuous with a 3-h peak to 1880 \u00b5g/m3 (1.0 ppm) for periods up to 24 weeks, did not result in any significant morphol ogical or biochemical changes. Mochitate et al. (1986) reported a significant increase in the total number of AMs isolated from rats during 10 days of exposure to 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (4.0 ppm) NO 2, but the number of PMNs August 2007 3-9 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 did not increase. The AMs from exposed animals also exhibited increased metabolic activity, as measured by the activities of glucose-6-phospha te dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, and pyruvate kinase. The AMs also showed increase d rates of synthesis of protein and DNA. All responses peaked on day 4 and returned to cont rol levels by the day 10. Increased numbers and metabolic activity of AMs would be expected to have a positiv e influence on host defenses. However, AMs are rich in proteolytic enzymes and increased numbers could result in some tissue destruction when the enzymes are releas ed. Schlesinger (1987a,b) found no significant changes in the number or the viability of AMs in BAL fluid from rabbits exposed to 564- or 1880-\u00b5g/m 3 (0.3 or 1.0 ppm) NO 2, 2 h/day for 13 days. Although there were no effects on the numbers of AMs that phagocytosed latex spheres, 2 days of exposure to 564 \u00b5g/m3 (0.3 ppm) decreased the phagocytic capacity (i.e., number of spheres phagocytosed per cell). The higher level of NO 2 increased phagocytosis, whereas longer exposures had no effect. In rats, continuous exposure at 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (4.0 ppm) or 15,000-\u00b5g/m3 (8.0 ppm) NO 2 for 10 days significantly increased the num ber of AMs in the BAL flui d, with the increase becoming significant by the fifth day of exposure. Viabilit y of these isolated cells decreased on day 1 and remained depressed throughout exposure. However, phagocytic activity of AMs was significantly depressed (after 5 days of exposure to 15,000 \u00b5g/m3 [8.0 ppm] and 7 days of exposure to 7520 \u00b5g/m3 [4.0 ppm]), but returned to the co ntrol value at 10 days of exposure (Suzuki et al., 1986). There may be a species difference in responsiveness, because Lefkowitz et al. (1986) did not obs erve a depression in phagocytosis in mice exposed for 7 days to 9400-\u00b5g/m 3 (5.0 ppm) NO 2. Suzuki et al. (1986) proposed that the i nhibition of phagocytosis might be due to NO 2 effects on membrane lipid peroxidation. Studies by Dowell et al. (1971) and Goldstein et al. (1977) add support to this hypothesis. Acute exposure to 5640 to 7520 \u00b5g/m3 (3.0 to 4.0 ppm) caused swelling of AMs (Dowell et al., 1971) and increased agglutin ation of AMs with concanavalin A (Goldstein et al., 1977), suggesting damage to membrane functions. NO 2 exposure appears to decrease the ability of rat AMs to produce superoxide anion, which may limit antibacterial ac tivity (Amoruso et al., 1981). Amoruso et al. (1981) presented evidence of such an effect at NO 2 concentrations ranging from 1.3 to 17.0 ppm. The duration of the NO 2 exposure was not given; all exposures were expressed in terms of parts per million \u00d7 h (ppm-h). A 50% decrease of superoxide anion production began after exposure to August 2007 3-10 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 54,700-\u00b5g/m3-h (29.1 ppm-h) NO 2. Suzuki et al. (1986) reported a marked decrease in the ability of rat AMs to produce superoxide anion following a 10-day exposure to either 7520- or 15,000-\u00b5g/m3 (4.0 or 8.0 ppm) NO 2. At the highest concentration, the effect was significant each day, but at the lower concentration, the de pression was significant only on exposure days 3, 5, and 10. Superoxide production in AMs from rat BAL fluid, stimulat ed by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), was decreased after 0.5 days of exposure to 940-\u00b5g/m3 (0.5 ppm) NO 2 and continued to be depressed after 1, 5, and 10 days of exposure (Robison et al., 1993). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Kumae and Arakawa (2006) compared the female offspring of Brown- Norway rats that were exposed continuously to NO 2 at 376, 940, or 3760 \u00b5g/m3 (0.2, 0.5, or 2.0 ppm) during breeding and gestation and up through 12 weeks of age to female offspring who were exposed continuously to 376, 940, or 3760 \u00b5g/m 3 (0.2, 0.5, or 2.0 ppm) only during the weanling period (from weeks 5 to 12). The ROS generation fr om AMs was significantl y suppressed in the 940- and 3760-\u00b5g/m3 (0.5 and 2.0 ppm) NO 2-exposed weanling animals; no change in ROS- generating capability was observed in the em bryonic-exposed animals compared to the air controls. The AMs obtained by BAL from baboons exposed to 3760-\u00b5g/m3 (2.0 ppm) NO 2 for 8 h/day, 5 days/week for 6 months had impaired responsiveness to migrat ion inhibitory factor produced by sensitized lymphocyt es (Green and Schneider, 1978). This substance affects the behavior of AMs by inhibiting fr ee migration, which in turn, in terferes with AM functional capacity. In addition, the random mobility of AMs was significantly depressed in rabbits following a 2 h/day exposure for 13 days to NO 2 at 564 \u00b5g/m3 (0.3 ppm) but not at 1880 \u00b5g/m3 (1.0 (Schlesinger, 1987b). Mast cells also play an impor tant role in modulating lung inflammatory responses. IgE- mediated histamine release from lung mast cells was significantly increased in guinea pigs, but not rats, exposed to 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (4.0 ppm) NO 2, 24 h/day for 12 weeks (Fujimaki and Nohara, 1994). No effect of NO 2 on histamine release was observed at the lower concentrations of 1880- or 3760-\u00b5g/m3 (1 or 2 ppm) NO 2. Several newer studies provide information on the concentration at which effects on the recruitment and infiltration of PMNs into the lung occur following NO 2 exposure. When Robison et al. (1993) exposed rats to 0 or 0.5-ppm NO 2, 8 h/day, 5 days/week for 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 days, no effects were observe d on neutrophil, lymphocyte, or macrophage/monocyte levels or August 2007 3-11 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 cell population percentages in BAL. Results, therefore, suggest no significant influx of inflammatory cells into lung airways and alveol ar spaces. In rats exposed to 0 or 1.2-ppm NO 2, there were no significant differences in cell vi ability and percentages of pulmonary AMs or PMNs between animals exposed to 1.2-ppm NO 2 and nonexposed controls (Bermudez, 2001). However, when Pagani et al . (1994) exposed rats to NO 2 at 0, 5, or 10 ppm, 24-h or 24 h/day for 7 days, exposure to 10 ppm caused maximal in flux of PMN at 24 h, but no influx was observed after 7 days of exposure. Like wise, no significant changes in lymphocyte counts were observed. Humoral Immunity and Response to Challenge Agents As noted by U.S. Environmental Protection Ag ency (1993), it is most relevant to assess the effects of inhaled compounds on cell-mediated and antibody responses in the lung itself, because this is the primary site of defense agai nst respiratory infections. However, because of technical obstacles, many older studies have as sessed the responses in inhaled pollutants or NO 2 in the spleen or peripheral blood. These studies are more difficult to interpret in terms of enhanced risk of respiratory infections. Some studies suggest little effect, whereas others suggest suppression or activation, depending not only on concentration bu t also on length of exposure, species tested, and specific endpoints measured. An nex Table AX4.3 summarizes the various humoral and cell-mediated eff ects seen in animals exposed to NO 2. Interaction with Infectious Microorganisms Suppression of host defense mechanisms by NO 2 as described in the studies above would be expected to result in an increased inciden ce and severity of pulmona ry infections (Miller et al., 1987, Gardner et al., 1979; Coffin and Gardner, 1972). Vari ous experimental approaches have been employed using animals in an effort to determine the overall functional efficiency of the host's pulmonary defenses following NO 2 exposure. In the most commonly used infectivity model, animals are exposed to either NO 2 or filtered air and the treatment groups are combined and exposed briefly to an aer osol of a viable mort ality rates are determined (Ehrlich, 1966; Henry et al., 1970; Coffin and Gardner, 1972; Ehrlich et al., 1979; Gardner, 1982). Although the endpoint is mortality, this experimental test is considered a sensitive indicator of the depression of the defense mechanisms and is a commonly used assay for assessing immunotoxicity.

No new studies published since 1993 were identified th at evaluated this endpoint. The susceptibility to bacterial and viral pulmonary infections in animals increases with NO 2 exposure. After acute exposure, the lowest observed concentrati on that increased lung susceptibil ity to bacterial infections was 3750-\u00b5g/m3 (2 ppm) NO 2 in a 3-h exposure study with mice (Ehrlich et al., 1977; Ehrlich, 1980). Acute (17 h) exposures to greater than 4250-\u00b5g/m3 (2.3 ppm) NO 2 also decreased pulmonary bactericidal activity in mice (Goldstein et al., 1974). L ong-term exposure studies have demonstrated that NO 2 exposure reduces the efficiency of defense against infections at concentrations as low as 940 \u00b5g/m3 (0.5 ppm). Mice challenged w ith influenza A/PR/8 virus after continuous exposure for 39 days had increased mortality (Ito, 1971); a 6-month exposure to the same NO 2 concentration likewise resulted in increased bacterial-induced mortality in mice (Ehrlich and Henry, 1968). Gardner et al. (1977a,b) also reported an increase in mortality with increasing length of exposure in mice exposed to NO 2 from 940 to 52,640 \u00b5g/m3 (0.5 to 28 ppm). The influence of a wide variety of exposure regimens has been evaluated using the infectivity model (Annex Table AX4.5). For example, the effect of varying durations of continuous exposure on the mortality of mice exposed to NO 2 was determined for varying durations of time (Gardner et al., 1977b). When the product of C \u00d7 T was held constant, the relationship between concentrati on and time produced significantly different mortality responses. Concentration had more influence than duration on the outcome. A more complete discussion of the C \u00d7 T relationship issues for NO 2 is summarized in a later sect ion. The effect of continuous versus intermittent exposure to NO 2 followed by bacterial challenge has been studied (Ehrlich and Henry, 1968; Gardner et al., 1979); results sugge st that fluctuating levels may ultimately be as toxic as sustained higher le vels (Gardner et al., 1979). Extens ive investigations have also been made on the response to airborne inf ections in mice breathing spike exposures to NO 2 superimposed on a lower con tinuous background level of NO 2, which simulates the pattern (although not the NO 2 concentrations) of exposure in the urban environment in the United States (Gardner 1980; Gardner et al., 1982 ; Graham et al., 1987). The pattern of exposure determined the response and that the response was found not to be predictable based on a simple C \u00d7 T relationship. Miller et al. (1987) further inve stigated the effects of chronic exposure to NO 2 August 2007 3-13 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 spikes on murine antibacterial l ung defenses using a spike-to-basel ine ratio of 4:1, which is not uncommon in the urban environment in the United States. Mice were exposed 23 h/day, 7 days/week for 1 year to a baseline of 376 \u00b5g/m 3 (0.2 ppm) or to this baseline level on which was superimposed a 1-h spike of 1500-\u00b5g/m3 (0.8 ppm) NO 2, twice a day, 5 days/week. There was significantly greater mortalit y in mice exposed to peak plus baseline compared to baseline- exposed animals. A dose-related decrease in pulmonary an tibacterial defenses occurs from NO 2 exposure. Decreases in antibacterial de fenses occurred at concentrations ranging from 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (4.0 ppm) NO 2 for Staphylococcus aureus to 37,500-\u00b5g/m3 (20 ppm) NO 2 for Proteus mirabilis (Jakab, 1987). Differences in species susceptibility to NO 2 or to a pathogen may play a role in the enhancement of mortality seen in experimental animals. Additional factors can influence the interaction of and infectious agents such as exercise (Illing et al ., 1980), the presence of O 3 (Ehrlich et al., 1977; Gardner, 1980; Gardner et al ., 1982; Graham et al., 1987), or elevated temperatures (Gardner et al., 1982). Table 3.2-1 summarizes a range of proposed mechanisms by which exposure to NO 2 in conjunction with viral infec tions may exacerbate upper and lower airways symptoms (Chauhan et al., 1998). 3.2.1.2 Effects of Short-Term NO 2 Exposure on Lung Function Epidemiological Studies of Lung Function Spirometry (FEV 1)\u2014Children Reliable, repeatable measurement of lung function in ch ildren presents special challenges. The method that seems to produce the most accurate results is spirometry, but because it requires special equipment and trained te sters, it is not generall y used for large-scale studies. Of the three studies re viewed here that did use spirom etry (Hoek and Brunekreef, 1994; Linn 2002), all c onducted repeat lung func tion measurements in schoolchildren. All found significan t associations between small decrements in lung function and increases in ambient NO 2 levels. Hoek and Brunekreef ( 1994) enrolled 1,079 children in the Netherlands to examine the effects of lo w-level winter air pollution on FVC, FEV 1, MMEF, and PEF. A significant effect was found only for the PEF measure: the mean (over all subjects) August 2007 3-14 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 slope (SE) was a reduction of 52 mL/s (95% CI: 21, 83) for 20-ppb increase in the previous day's NO 2. The authors do not give mean values fo r lung function measurements, so it is not possible to calculate what percentage of PEF th is decrement represents. Linn et al. (1996) examined 269 Los Angeles-area schoolchildren and short-term air pollution exposures. The authors found statistically significant associations between previous-day 24-h NO 2 concentrations and FVC the next morning (mean decline of 8 mL [95% CI: 2, 14] per 20-ppb increase in NO 2), and current-day 24-h NO 2 concentrations and morning to evening changes in FEV 1 (mean decline of 8 mL [95% CI : 2, 14] per 20-ppb increase in NO 2). Timonen et al. (2002) enrolled 33 Finnish children with chronic respiratory symptoms to study the effects of exercise-induced lung function ch anges and ambient air pollution. No significant effects were observed for lung function changes due to exercise , but significant associ ations were observed for level of NO 2 lagged by 2 days and baseline FVC (mean decline of 21 mL [95% CI: !29, !12] for 20-ppb NO 2) and of 20 mL [95% CI: !26, !13] for 20-ppb NO 2). Supervised Peak Flow Meter Measurements\u2014Children Other studies conducted superv ised lung function measuremen ts in schoolchildren using peak flow devices (Scarlett et al., 1996; Peacock et al., 2003; Steerenberg et al., 2001). Scarlett et al. (1996) used portable peak flow meters to measure lung function in 154 pupils in a school in southern England. No significant associati ons were found between level of ambient NO 2 and FEV 0.75, FVC, or the ratio of FEV 0.75 to FVC. They also reported that lung function of children with current wheeze (n = 14) was not differentia lly affected. In a second study by the same group of investigators, Peacock et al. (2003) measured peak flow rates for 177 children in three schools in southern England. Although no signifi cant associations were found between level of NO 2 and peak flow, there was a significant association for peak flow decrements of 20% or more with NO 2 lagged by 2 days or averaged over the prev ious 4 days. For all children, the OR (95% CI) for each 20-ppb increase in NO 2 was 1.91 (95% CI: 1.52, 2.76) and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.00, 5.50) for a 2-day lag and 1 to 4 day lag, respec tively. Odds ratios (OR) were similar for a subset of 43 children with current wheeze (as determined by a questionnaire administered to parents) (OR = 1.70 [95% CI: for a 2-day lag and 1 to 4 day lag, respectively). Steerenberg et al. (2001) enrolled 82 children (38 urban, 44 suburban) in the Netherlands and collected supervised peak flow measurements at their August 2007 3-15 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 schools. Significant inverse associ ations were found between PEF and NO 2: each 20-ppb increase in NO 2 lagged by 1 day was associated with a 3.1% decrease in PEF. Ward et al. (2002) studied the effects of air pollutants on PEF on a panel of 162 nine-year-old children in England for winter and summer periods and reporte d no significant associ ations between NO 2 and lung functions or symptoms. Home-Use Peak Flow Meter Measurements\u2014Children Reliable data are notoriously difficult to come by using portable peak flow measuring devices (for example, see Wensley and Silv erman, 2001). This may help explain why, in contrast to studies with supervised measurements , none of the nine studies using home peak flow measurements reported any significa nt associations with ambient NO 2 (Roemer et al., 1998 [2,010 children in the PEACE study in Europe]; Roemer et al., 1999 [a subset of 1,621 children from the PEACE study with chronic respiratory symptoms]; Mortimer et al., 2002 [846 asthmatic children from the NCICAS]; Van der Zee et al., 1999 [633 children in the Netherlands]; Timonen al., 2004 [118 with asthma , in the Italian AIRE study]; Segala et al., 1998 and Just et al., 2002 [over 80 asthmatic children in Paris]; Delfino et al., 2003a [22 asthmatic children in southern California]). Ward et al. (2000) examined the effect of correcting peak flow for nonlinear errors on NO 2 effects estimates in a panel study of 147 (47% female) 9-year olds. The correction resulted in a small increase in the group mean PEF (1.1 L-min!1). For the entire panel, NO 2 effect estimates were all corrected in the positive di rection with a narrowing of the 95% confidence interval, and all but the result for 0-day lag were decreased in absolute size by up to 73% (effect estimate for NO 2 lagged 3 days corrected from ! 0.56 to !0.15% per 10 ppb). When only the symptomatic/atopic children (i.e., reported wheezing and positive skin test) were considered, the estimates for associations with 5-day average NO 2 decreased in size from !2.53% to ! 0.90% per 10 ppb. In addition, lag 0 became significant with an increase in magnitude from !0.51% to !1.22% per 10 ppb. Figures 3.2-1 and 3.2-2 illustrate the results for the whole panel and the symptomatic/atopic children, respectively.

Patients were followed for two 1-month periods during a spring and winter. Significant inverse relationships were also found for FEV 1 in this study for both COPD and asthmatic patients. For each 20-ppb increase in NO 2 concentration FEV 1 decreased by 4.36% (95% CI: 1.18, 7.54) for previous day's NO 2 or by 5.19% (95% CI: 1.58, 8.80) for the mean of the previous 2 days' NO 2 levels for COPD patients.

Subjects were enrolled in one of two winters (n = 16 and 18 per winter panel). The authors observed no adverse effects of ambient ai r pollution on lung function for the first winter, but in the second winter did see a significant de crease in morning PEF associated with same day and previous day NO 2 level (quantitative results not provided). Home-Use Peak Flow Meter Measurements\u2014Adults Of the studies reviewed that employed porta ble peak flow meters for subject-measured lung function, none reported significant associations with NO 2 levels (van der Zee et al., 2000 [489 adults in the Netherlands]; Higgins et al., 1995 [153 adults in th e UK including COPD and asthma patients]; Park et al., 2005a [64 asthma tic adults in Korea]; Hiltermann et al., 1998 [60 asthmatic adults in the Netherlands]; Harre et al., 1997 [40 adults with COPD in Zealand]; Forsberg et al., 1998 [38 adult asth matics in Sweden]; and Higgins et al., 2000 [35 adults in the UK with COPD or asthma]). Clinical Studies of Lung Function Healthy Adults Studies examining responses of healt hy volunteers to acute exposure to NO 2 have generally failed to show alterations in lung mech anics such as airways re sistance (Hackney et al., et al., 1992; Rasmussen et al ., et al., 1996; Azadniv et al., 1998; Devlin et al., 1999). Exposures ranging fro m 75 minutes to 5 h at concentrations up to 4.0-ppm NO 2 did not alter pulmonary function. Bylin et al. (1985) found increased airways resistance after a 20-m in exposure to 0.25-ppm NO 2 and decreased airways resistance after a 20-min exposure to 0.5-ppm NO 2, but no change in airways responsiveness to aerosolized histamine challenge in the same subjects. Th ese effects have not been confirmed in other laboratories. Few human clinical studies of NO 2 have included elderly subject s. Morrow et al. (1992) studied the responses of 20 healthy volunteers , 13 smokers, and 7 nonsmokers, of mean age 61 years, following exposure to 0.3-ppm NO 2 for 4 h with light exercise. There was no significant change in lung function related to NO 2 exposure for the group as a whole. However, August 2007 3-19 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 the 13 smokers experienced a slight decrease in FEV 1 during exposure, and their responses were significantly different from the 7 nonsmokers (% change in FEV 1 at end of exposure: !2.25 versus +1.25%, p = 0.01). The post-hoc an alysis and small numbers of subjects, especially in the nonsmoking group, limits the interpretation of these findings. The controlled studies reviewed in O 3 AQCD (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2006) generally reported only small pulmonary f unction changes after co mbined exposures of NO 2 or HNO 3 with O 3, regardless of whether the interactive e ffects were potentiating or additive. Hazucha et al. (1994) found that pree xposure of healthy women to 0.6-ppm NO 2 for 2 h enhanced spirometric responses and methacholine airways responsiv eness induced by a subsequent 2-h exposure to 0.3-ppm O 3, with intermittent exercise. Following a 1-h exposure with heavy exercise, Adams et al. (1987) found no differences between spirometric responses to 0.3-ppm O 3 and the combination of 0.6-ppm NO 2 + 0.3-ppm O 3. However, the increase in airways resistance was significantly less for NO 2 + O 3 than for O 3 alone. Gong et al. (2005) studied 6 healthy elderly subjects (mean age 68 years) and 18 patients with COPD (mean age 71 y ears), all exposed to: (a) air, (b) 0.4-ppm NO 2, (c) ~200 \u00b5g/m3 concentrated ambient fine particles (CAPs), and (d) CAPs + NO 2. Exposures were for 2-h with exercise for 15 min of each half hour. CAPs expo sure was associated with small reductions in mid-expiratory flow rates on spirometry, and reductions in oxygen saturation, but there were no effects of NO 2 on lung function, oxygen saturation, or sput um inflammatory cells. However, the exposures were not fully randomized or blinded, and most of the NO 2 exposures took place months after completion of the CAPs and air exposures. In addition, the small number of healthy subjects severely limits the sta tistical power for this group. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients Few studies have examined responses to NO 2 in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hackney et al. (197 8) found no lung function effects of exposure to 0.3-ppm NO 2 for 4-h with intermittent exercise in smokers with symptoms and reduced FEV 1. In a group of 22 subjects with moderate COPD , Linn et al. (1985b) found no pulmonary effects of 1-h exposures to 0.5-, 1.0-, or 2.0-ppm NO 2 with 30 min of exercise. In a study by Morrow et al. (1992), 20 subjec ts with COPD were exposed for 4-h to 0.3-ppm NO 2 in an environmental chamber, with intermittent exercise.

The decrements in FVC occurred without changes in flow rates. These changes in lung function were typical of the \"restrictive\" pattern seen with O 3 rather than the obstructive changes descri bed by some studies of NO 2 exposure in asthmatics. Gong et al. (2005) exposed 6 elderly healt hy adults and 10 COPD patients to four separate atmospheres: (a) air, (b) 0.4-ppm NO 2, (c) ~200-\u00b5g/m3 CAPs, or (d) CAPs + NO 2. As noted above, there were no significant effects of NO 2 in either the healthy or the COPD subjects. Asthmatic Individuals Kleinman et al. (1983) evalua ted the response of lightly exercising asthmatic subjects to inhalation of 0.2-ppm NO 2 for 2 h, during which resting mi nute ventilation doubled. Forced expiratory flows and airways resistance were not altered by the NO 2 exposure. Bauer et al. (1986) studied the effects of mouthpiece exposure to 0.3-ppm NO 2 for 30 min (20 min at rest followed by 10 min of exercise at ~40 L/min) in 15 asthmatics. At this level, NO 2 inhalation produced significant decrements in forced expiratory flow rates after exerci se, but not at rest. J\u00f6rres and Magnussen (1991) found no effects on lung function in 11 patients with mild asthma exposed to 0.25-ppm NO 2 for 30-min, including 10-min of exercise. However, small reductions in FEV 1 were observed following 1-ppm NO 2 exposure for 3-h with intermittent exercise in 12 mild asthmatics. Koenig et al. (1994) found no pulmonary function effects of exposure to 0.3-ppm NO 2 in combination with 0.12-ppm O 3, with or without sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) (70 \u00b5g/m3) or HNO 3 (0.05 ppm), in 22 adolescents with mild asthma. However, 6 additional subjects dropped out of the study citing uncomfortable respiratory symptoms. Jenkins et al. (1999) examined FEV 1 decrements and airways re sponsiveness to allergen in a group of mild, atopic asthmatics. The subjec ts were exposed during rest for 6 h to filtered air, NO 2 (200 ppb), O 3 (100 ppb), or NO 2 (200 ppb) + O 3 (100 ppb). The subjects were also exposed for 3 h to NO 2 (400 ppb), O 3 (200 ppb), or NO 2 (400 ppb) + O 3 (200 ppb) to provide doses identical to those in the 6-h protocols (i.e., equal C \u00d7 T) . Immediately following the 3-h exposure, but not after the 6-h exposure, th ere were significant decrements in FEV 1 following O3 and NO 2 + O 3 exposures.

Each 20-ppb increase in same-day NO 2 concentration was associated with FVC deficits of 0.3% (Linn et al., 1996) to 2.7% (Schindler et al., 2001). No significant asso ciations were reported in any studies using unsupervised, self-administered peak flow measurements with portable devices. Clinical studies have not pr ovided compelling evidence of NO 2 effects on pulmonary function. Acute exposures of young, healthy volunteers to NO 2 at levels as high as 4.0 ppm do not alter lung function as measured by spirometry or airways resistance. The small number of studies of COPD patients prevents any conclu sions about effects on pulmonary function. The Morrow et al. (1992) study, performed in Rocheste r, NY, suggested restri ctive type effects of 0.3-ppm NO 2 exposure for 4 h. However, three other studies, performed in Southern California at similar exposure concentrations, found no effects. The contrasting findings in these studies may, in part, reflect the differe nce in duration of exposure or the differing levels of background ambient air pollution to which the subjects were exposed chronically, as there were much lower background levels in Rochester, NY than in Southe rn California. For asth matics, the effects of NO 2 on pulmonary function have also been inconsis tent at exposure concentrations of less than 1-ppm NO 2. Overall, clinical studies ha ve failed to show effects of NO 2 on pulmonary function at exposure concentrations relevant to ambient e xposures. However, highly variable findings in COPD and asthmatic patients suggest that some individuals may be partic ularly susceptible to NO 2 effects. 3.2.1.3 Respiratory Symptoms Since the 1993 AQCD, results have been publis hed from several single-city and multicity studies, including three large long itudinal studies in urban areas covering the continental United States and southern Ontario: the Harvard Six Cities study (Six Cities; Schwartz et al., 1994), the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study (NCICAS; Mortimer et al., 2002), and the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP; Sch ildcrout et al., 2006). Because of similar analytic techniques (i.e., multistaged modeling an d generalized estimating equations [GEE]), one strength of all three of these studies is that, as Schildcrout et al. (2006) st ated, they could each be considered as a meta-analysis of \"large, within-cit y panel studies\" without some of the August 2007 3-22 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 limitations associated with meta-analyses, e .g., \"between-study heterogeneity and obvious publication bias.\" The report from the Six Cities study include s 1,844 schoolchildren who were followed for 1 year (Schwartz et al., 1994). Symptoms (in 13 categories, analyzed as cough, lower or upper respiratory symptoms), were recorded da ily. Cities included Watertown (MA), Baltimore, Kingston-Harriman (TN), Steubenville, Topeka, a nd Portage (WI). In Mortimer et al. (2002), 864 asthmatic children were followed daily for four 2-week periods over the course of 9 months. The eight NCICAS cities were New York City (Bronx, E. Harlem), Baltimore, Washington (DC), Cleveland, Detroit, St Louis, and Chi cago. Morning and evening asthma symptoms (analyzed as none versus any) and peak flow we re recorded. Schildcrout et al. (2006) reported on 990 asthmatic children living within 50 miles of one of 31 NO 2 monitors located in eight North American cities (Boston, Baltimore, Toronto, St. Louis, Denver, Albuquerque, San Diego, and Seattle). Symptoms (analy zed as none versus any per day) and rescue medication use (analyzed as number of uses pe r day) were recorded daily for 2 months. All three studies found significant associations between level of NO 2 exposure and risk of respiratory symptoms in children (Schwartz et al., 1994), and in particul ar, asthmatic children (Mortimer et al., 2002; Schildcrout et al., 2006). In Schwartz et al. (1994), a significant association was f ound between a 4-day mean of NO 2 exposure and incidence of cough among all child ren in single-pollutant models: the odds ratio (OR) was reported for each 10-ppb increase in NO 2 as OR = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.56) (given in Annex Table AX6.2 for a 20-ppb increa se). Cough incidence was not significantly associated with NO 2 on the previous day. The local nonpara metric smooth of the 4-day mean concentration showed increased (p = 0.01) cough incidence up to approximately the mean concentration (~13 ppb), after which no furthe r increase was observed. The significant association between co ugh and 4-day mean NO 2 remained unchanged in models that included O3, but was attenuated and lost significance in two-pollutant models including PM 10 (OR for 10-ppb increase in NO 2 = 1.17 [95% CI: 0.94, 1.46]) or SO 2 (OR for NO 2 = 1.19 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.51]). In Mortimer et al. (2002), the greatest e ffect of the pollutants studied for morning symptoms was for a 6-day moving average. For increased NO 2, the risk of any asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, shortness of breath) am ong the asthmatic children in the NCICAS August 2007 3-23 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 was somewhat higher than for the healthy childre n in the Six Cities study: OR = 1.48 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.16). Effects were attenuated in multipollutant models that included O 3 (OR for 20-ppb increase in NO 2 = 1.40 [95% CI: 0.93, 2.09]), O 3 and SO 2 for NO 2 = 1.31 [95% CI: 0.87, 2.09]), or O 3, SO 2, and PM 10 (OR for NO 2 = 1.45 [95% CI: 0.63, 3.34]). In the CAMP study (Shildcrout et al., 2006), the strongest association between NO 2 and increased risk of cough was found for a 2- day lag: each 20-ppb increase in NO 2 occurring 2 days before measurement increased risk of cough (OR = 1.09 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.15]). Two-pollutant models including CO, PM 10, or SO 2 produced similar results . (See Figure 3.2-3.) Further, increased NO 2 exposure was associated with increased use of rescue medication in the CAMP study, with the strongest associa tion for a 2-day lag, both for single- and multipollutant models (e.g., for an increase of 20-ppb NO 2 in the single-pollutant model, the RR for increased inhaler usage was 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.09). (See Figure 3.2-4.) Two 3-month-long panel studies recruited asthmatic children from the one outpatient clinic in Paris: one study fo llowed 84 children in the fall of 1992 (Segala et al., 1998), and the other followed 82 children during the winter of 1996 (Just et al., 2002). GEE in logistic regression analyses found signifi cant associations between respiratory symptoms and level of NO 2 and are shown in Annex Table AX6.2 for each 20-ppb increase in NO 2. No multipollutant models were shown. In metropolitan Sydney, 148 children with a history of wheeze were followed for 11 months (Jalaludin et al., 2004) . Daily symptoms, medication use, and doctor visits were examined. In regression models using GEE, significant associations were found between increased likelihood of wet cough and each 8.2-ppb increase in NO 2 (OR = 1.05 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.10]). The authors report that estimates did not change in multipollutant models including O 3 or PM 10. Ward et al. (2002) examined respiratory symptoms in a panel of 162 children in the United Kingdom. No significant associations were reported for the winter peri od, but a significant association was reported for th e summer period for cough and NO 2 (lag 0; OR = 1.09 [95% CI: 1.17, 1.01]).

Asso ciations were found between NO 2 and either respiratory symptoms or inhaler use in a number studies (van der Zee et al., 2000; Harre et al., 1997; Silkoff August 2007 3-26 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 et al., 2005; Segala et al., 2004; Hiltermann et al., 1998), but not in all studies (Desqueyroux et al., 2002; von Klot et al., 2002). Summary Analysis Methodology of Respiratory Symptom Studies Of the ambient exposure studies reviewed a bove, it is striking th at the studies using generalized estimating equations (GEE) in the an alysis also report significant associations between daily exposure to NO 2 and respiratory effects (see li st of these studies in Annex Table AX6.2). It is possible th at the development of the GEE extension to generalized linear models (GLM) for analysis of longitudinal data (Liang and Zeger, 1986) and subsequent availability of GEE in statistical analysis pack ages permitted a much more accurate estimate of within-subjects variability in repeated-measures designs. This may explain, in part, why so many of the studies using GEE in the analysis show associations betw een daily exposure and symptoms, while other studies us ing alternative methods to estim ate (and perhaps overestimate) autocorrelation do not (e.g., Roemer et al., 1998 and the PEACE study). Among the studies using GEE, with the exception of Mortimer et al. (2002) where the strongest association was with a mean of the previous 6 days, studies enrolling asthmatics, children or adults, found significant associations between ambient NO 2 exposure and respiratory symptoms for lags of 0, 1, or 2 days (see Annex Table AX6.2). Interestingly, for the three stud ies enrolling healthy subjects (Schwartz et al., 1994; Pino et al., 2004; Segala et al., 2004) significant associations are only found for longer lag times (of 4 to 6 days). All significant associ ations between ambient NO 2 and respiratory symptoms occurred in locations with 24-h average NO 2 levels below the annual EPA standard of 53 ppb. Odds ratios and 95% confidence limits for asso ciations with cough and asthma symptoms in children are presented in Figures 3.2-5 and 3.2- 6, respectively. These figures are called forest plots, and the area of the square denoting the odds ratio is the proportional to the weight of the study. When combined in a random effect me ta-analysis, the results for cough showed a significant association with NO 2 exposure (OR = 1.09 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.24]; p value in test for heterogeneity = 0.110). For asthma symptoms, th e combined odds ratio from a meta-analyses was 1.14, (95% CI: 1.05, 1.24), and the test for heterogeneity had a p value of 0.055. The effects used in the analysis were selected as fo llows.

(2001) examined school absence among 2,081 schoolchildren in 12 communities in Southern California and found significant associations between 20-ppb increases in O 3 and respiratory illness related absences, but no association in single-pollutant models with NO 2 or PM 10. Annual mean daily NO 2 in the 12 communities ranged from 5 to 45 ppb. Park et al. (2002) studied school absenteeism in an elementary school in Seoul, Korea, and found significant risks associated with increases of PM 10 (RR = 1.06 [95% CI: 1.04, 1.09] for each 42.1-\u00b5g/m3 increase), SO 2 (RR = 1.09 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.12] for each 5.68-ppb increase), and O 3 (RR = 1.08 [95% CI: 1.06, August 2007 3-30 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 1.11] for each 15.94-ppb increase) but none with NO 2 (although there is a suggestion of an association with an RR of 1.02 (95% CI : 0.99, 1.04) for each 14.51-ppb increase). Summary Taken together, these studies indica te that short-term exposure to NO 2 is associated with respiratory symptoms in children and adults. For children, the results of new multicity studies provide substantial support for associations with respiratory symptoms, particularly in asthmatic children. In adults, the recen t studies link short-term NO 2 exposure with various respiratory symptoms or medication use, but the findings are not always consistent. 3.2.1.4 Airways Inflammation Epidemiological Studies of Airways Inflammation A number of studies have examined biol ogical markers for inflammation (exhaled NO and inflammatory nasal lavage [NAL] marker s [Steerenberg et al., 2001, 2003]; exhaled NO [Adamkiewicz et al., 2004]) and lung damage (uri nary Clara cell protein CC16 [Timonen et al., 2004]). Steerenberg et al. (2001) studied 126 schoolchildren from urban and suburban communities in the Netherlands. Sampling of exhaled air and NAL fluid was performed seven times, once per week over th e course of 2 months. On average, the ambient NO 2 levels were 1.5 times higher and ambient NO levels 7.8 times higher in the urban compared to suburban community. Compared to children in the subur ban community, urban children had significantly greater levels of inflammatory NAL markers (IL-8, urea, uric acid, albumin) but not greater levels of exhaled NO. However, within the urban group, a concentration-response relationship was seen. For increases of 20 ppb in NO 2 lagged by 1 or 3 days, exhaled NO increased significantly by 6.4 to 8.8 ppb. Exhaled NO also increased for suburban children versus comparable increases in NO 2, but not significantly. Another study by Steerenberg et al. (2003) of 119 schoolchildren in the Netherlands found associations between ambient NO 2 and level of exhaled NO, but quantitative regre ssion results are not given. The authors concluded from their data that an established, ongoing inflammatory response to pollen wa s not exacerbated by subsequent exposure to high le vels of air pollution or polle n Steerenberg et al., (2003).

Timonen et al. (2004) collected biweekly urine samples for 6 months from 131 adults with coronary heart disease living in Amsterda m, Helsinki, and Erfurt, Germany. Estimates using data from all three communities showed sign ificant associations between urinary levels of Clara cell protein CC16 (a marker for l ung damage) with elevations in daily PM 2.5 concentration, but not ambient NO 2. In Helsinki, however, there wa s a significant association between a 10-\u00b5g/m3 increase in NO 2 lagged by 3 days and a 9.2% increase (95% CI: 0.1, 18.3) in ln(CC16). Interestingly, the correlation between NO 2 and PM 2.5 was lower in Helsinki (r = 0.35) compared to this correlation in Amst erdam (r = 0.49) or Erfurt (r = 0.82). Bernard et al. (1998) examined personal exposure to NO 2 and its effect on plasma antioxidants in a group of 107 healthy adults in Montpellier, France. Subjects wore passive monitors for 14 days. When subjects were divided into two exposure groups (above and below 40 \u00b5g/m 3 [21.3 ppb]), those in the high-exposur e group had significantly lower plasma $-carotene levels. This difference was even gr eater when analysis was stratified by dietary $-carotene intake: exposure to >40-\u00b5g/m3 NO 2 had the largest effect on plasma $-carotene level among subjects who ate <4 mg/day $-carotene (p < 0.005). No othe r pollutants were included in this study. Clinical Studies of Airways Inflammation Healthy Adults Helleday et al. (1994) perfor med BAL before and 24 h af ter exposure to 3.5-ppm NO 2 for 20 min, with 15 min of light exercise in 8 smokers and 8 nonsmokers. The recovery of PMNs in the bronchial portion of BAL was slightly increase d in the nonsmokers, while only the alveolar portion showed increased PMN numbers in smokers . A significant weakness of this study was the failure to include a tr ue air exposure with a randomized, double-blind design. The 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen cited preliminary findings from two studies showing modest airways inflammation, as indicated by increased PMN numbers in BAL fluid after exposure to 2.0-ppm NO 2 for 4 to 6-h with intermittent exer cise. Both of those studies have now been published in complete form Azadniv et al. (1998); Devlin et al. (1999), and additional August 2007 3-32 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 studies summarized below provide d a clearer picture of the airw ays inflammatory response to NO 2 exposure. Healthy volunteers exposed to 2.0-ppm NO 2 for 6-h with intermittent exercise (Azadniv et al., 1998) showed a slight in crease in the percentage of PMNs obtained in BAL fluid 18-h after exposure (air, 2.2 \u00b1 0.3%; NO 2, 3.1 \u00b1 0.4%). In a separate group of subjects exposed using the same protocol but assessed immediately afte r exposure Gavras et al ., (1994), no effects were found in AM phenotype or expressi on of the cell adhesion molecule CD11b or receptors for IgG. Blomberg et al. (1997) reported that 4-h exposures to 2.0-ppm NO 2 resulted in an increase in IL-8 and PMNs in the proximal airways of hea lthy subjects, although no changes were seen in bronchial biopsies. This group al so studied the effects of repeated 4-h exposures to 2-ppm NO 2 on 4 consecutive days, with BAL, bronchial biop sies, and BAL fluid antioxidant levels assessed 1.5-h after the last exposure Blomberg et al., (1 999). The bronchial wash fraction of BAL fluid showed a 2-fold increase in PMNs and a 1.5-fold increase in myeloperoxidase, indicating persistent mild airways inflammation with repeated NO 2 exposure. Devlin et al. (1999) exposed 8 healthy nonsmokers to 2.0-ppm NO 2 for 4-h with intermittent exercise. BAL performed the fo llowing morning showed a 3.1-fold increase in PMNs recovered in the bronchial fraction, in dicating small airways inflammation. These investigators also observed a reduction in AM phagocytosis and superoxide production, indicating possible adverse e ffects on host defense. Pathmanathan et al. (2003) conducted four repe ated daily exposures of healthy subjects to 4-ppm NO 2 or air for 4 h, with intermittent exercise . Exposures were randomized and separated by 3 weeks. Bronchoscopy and bronchial biopsies we re performed 1-h after the last exposure. Immunohistochemistry of the respiratory epitheliu m showed increased expression of IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, well These are upregulated in Th2 inflammatory responses, which are characterist ic of allergic inflammation. The findings suggest repeated NO 2 exposures may drive the ai rways inflammatory response toward a Th2 or allergic-type response. Unfortunately, th e report provided no data on inflammatory cell responses in the epithelium or on cells or cytokines in BAL fluid. Thus, the findings cannot be considered conclusive regard ing allergic inflammation. Furthermore, the exposure concentrations of 4 ppm are considerab ly higher than ambient outdoor concentrations.

Frampton et al. (2002) examined NO 2 concentration responses in 21 healthy nonsmokers. Subjects were exposed to air or 0.6- or 1.5-ppm NO 2 for 3 h, with intermittent exercise, with exposures separated by at le ast 3 weeks. BAL was performed 3.5-h after exposure. PMN numbers in the bronchial lava ge fraction increased slightly (<3-fold) but significantly (p = 0.0003) afte r exposure to 1.5-ppm NO 2; no increase was evident at 0.6-ppm NO 2. Lymphocyte numbers increased in the bronchial lavage fraction after 0.6-ppm NO 2, but not 1.5 ppm. CD4+ T lymphocyte numbers increased in the alveolar lavage fraction, and lymphocytes decreased in blood. These findings suggest a lymphocytic airways inflammatory response to 0.6-ppm NO 2, which changes to a mild neutrophilic response at 1.5-ppm NO 2. J\u00f6rres et al. (1995) found that 3-h exposures to 1-ppm NO 2 with intermittent exercise altered levels of eicosanoids, but not inflam matory cells, in BAL fluid collected 1-h after exposure. Eicosanoids are chemical mediators of the inflammatory respon se; their increase in BAL fluid in this study suggests inflammation. The absence of an increase in PMN numbers may reflect the timing of bronchoscopy (1 h afte r exposure). The peak influx of PMNs may occur several hours after expos ure, as it does following O 3 exposure. The studies summarized in th is section provide evidence for airways inflammation at NO 2 concentrations of <2.0 ppm; separately anal yzing the bronchial frac tion of BAL appears to increase the sensitivity for detecting airways inflammatory effects of NO 2 exposure. The onset of inflammatory responses in healthy subjects appears to be between 100 and 200 ppm-min, i.e., 1 ppm for 2 to 3 h. Toxicological Studies of Airways Inflammation Numerous studies demonstrate changes in protein and enzyme levels in the lung following inhalation of NO 2 (see Annex Table AX4.2). These obs ervations reflect the ability of NO 2 to cause lung inflammation associated with concomitant infiltration of serum protein, enzymes, and inflammatory cells. However, inte rpretation of the array of changes observed may also reflect other factors. For example, NO 2 exposure may induce differentiation of some cell populations in response to damage-induced tissu e remodeling. Thus, some changes in lung enzyme activity and protein content may reflect ch anges in cell types, ra ther than the direct effects of NO 2 on protein infiltration. Furthermore, some direct effects of NO 2 on enzymes are August 2007 3-34 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 possible because NO 2 can oxidize certain reducib le amino acids or side chains of proteins in aqueous solution (Freeman and Mudd, 1981). Increased BAL fluid protein levels have been observed at low concentrations of NO 2. Exposure to 752-\u00b5g/m3 (0.4 ppm) NO 2 continuously for 1 week re sulted in increases in BAL protein in vitamin c-deficient guinea pigs (She rwin and Carlson, 1973). A slight increase in albumin, indicating a mild degree of injury to the pulmonary capillary membrane, was observed in mice exposed to 9400-\u00b5g/m3 (5.0 ppm) NO 2, 6 h/day for 6 days Rose et al., (1989). Guinea pigs demonstrated significantly increased la ctate dehydrogenase (LDH) content of the lower lobes of the lung following exposure to 3760-\u00b5g/m3 (2.0 ppm) NO 2 for 1, 2, or 3 weeks Sherwin et al., (1972). However, in rats, increases in LDH in BAL fluid were noted at exposure to 1880 to 9400-\u00b5g/m3 (1.0 to 5.0 ppm) NO 2, 7-h/day, 5-days/week for 2.7 weeks, but values returned to control levels after 15 weeks of exposure while histological changes persisted (Gregory et al., 1983). Numerous studies in rats and mice pub lished since the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen have investigated the ability of NO 2 to induce protein level changes consistent with inflammation. Muller et al. (1994) expos ed rats to 0, 0.8-, 5-, or 10-ppm NO 2 continuously for 1 or 3 days and reported that BAL protein content significantly increased in a concentration- and exposure duration-dependent manner, with the cha nge becoming significant at 5 ppm for 3 days and at 10 ppm for $1 day of exposure. Pagani et al. (1994) exposed rats to 0, 9-, or 18-mg/m3 (0, 5, or 10 ppm) NO 2, 24 h or 24-h/day for 7 days. In thei r study, protein content in BAL fluid increased significantly only afte r 24 h of exposure to 10-ppm NO 2. Overall, these newer studies suggest that ma rkers of inflammation measured in BAL fluid such as total protein content and content of markers of cell membrane permeability (e.g., LDH) increase only at or above 5-ppm exposure. Ba sed on the new studies, rats and mice appear to respond in a similar fashion. It has also been reported th at protein content changes in BAL fluid can be dependent on dietary antioxidant status, further clouding the interpreta tion of such effects. NO 2 exposure increases the protein content of BAL fluid in vitamin C- deficient guinea pigs at NO 2 levels as low as 1880 \u00b5g/m3 (1.0 ppm) after a 72-h exposure, but a 1-week exposure to 752 \u00b5g/m3 (0.4 ppm) did not increase protein levels (Selgrade et al., 1981). The re sults of this 1-week exposure apparently conflict w ith those of Sherwin and Carl son (1973), who found increased August 2007 3-35 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE protein content of BAL fluid from vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs exposed to 752-\u00b5g/m3 (0.4 ppm) NO 2 for 1 week. Differences in exposure techniques, protein measurement methods, and/or degree of vitamin C deficiencies may explain the difference between the two studies. Hatch et al. (1986) found that the NO 2-induced increase in BAL protein in vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs was accompanied by an increase in lung content of nonprotein sulfhydryls and ascorbic acid and a decrease in vitamin E c ontent. The increased susceptibility to NO 2 was observed when lung vitamin C was reduced ( by diet) to levels <50% of normal. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Summary Recent epidemiological studies provide some evidence that short-term exposure to NO 2 can result in inflammatory responses in the airways, but the findings are not consistently positive. The controlled human exposure studies summarized in this section provide evidence for airways inflammation at NO 2 concentrations of <2.0 ppm; se parately analyzing the bronchial fraction of BAL appears to increase the sensitivit y for detecting airways inflammatory effects of NO 2 exposure. The onset of inflammatory respons es in healthy subjects appears to be between 100 and 200 ppm-min, i.e., 1 ppm for 2 to 3 h. Bi ological markers of inflammation are reported in antioxidant-deficient laboratory animals with exposures to 0.4-ppm NO 2. Normal animals do not respond until exposed to much higher levels, i.e., 5-ppm NO 2. Together, the available evidence indicates that short-term exposure to NO 2 may result in airways inflammation particularly among the more susceptible, such as those with antio xidant deficiencies. 3.3.1.5 Airways Hyperresponsiveness Clinical Studies of Airways Responsiveness Inhaled pollutants such as NO 2 may have direct effects on lung function, or they may enhance the inherent responsiv eness of the airways to cha llenge with a bronchoconstricting agent. Several drugs and othe r stimuli that cause bronchoconst riction have been used in challenge testing, including the cholinergic drugs methacholine and carbachol, as well as histamine, hypertonic saline, cold air, and SO 2. Challenge with \"specific\" allergens is considered in asthmatics. Asthmatics are generally much more sensitiv e to nonspecific bronchoconstricting agents than non-asthmatics, and airways ch allenge testing is used as a di agnostic test in asthma. There August 2007 3-36 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 is a wide range of airways responsiveness in he althy people, and responsiveness is influenced by many factors, including medica tions, cigarette smoke, pollutants, respiratory infections, occupational exposures, and respirat ory irritants. Standards for airways challenge testing have been developed for the clinical laboratory (American Thoracic Society, 2000a). However, variations in methods for administering the br onchoconstricting agents may substantially affect the results (Cockcroft et al., 2005). Increases in nonspecific airways responsiveness in response to pollutant exposure mean that the pollutant causes the airways to be more sensitive to other stimuli, and in asthmatics, is one indicator of increased severi ty of disease. In addition, in creases in airways responsiveness are correlated with worsened asthma control, and effective treatment often reduces airways responsiveness. Nonspecific Responsiveness in Healthy Adults Several observations indicate that NO 2 exposures in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 ppm cause small but significant increases in airways responsiveness in hea lthy subjects. Mohsenin (1988) found that a 1-h exposure to 2-ppm NO 2 increased responsiveness to methacholine, as measured by changes in specific airways conductance, wi thout directly affec ting lung function. Furthermore, pretreatment with ascorbic acid prevented the NO 2-induced increase in airways responsiveness (Mohsenin, 1987a). A mild increase in resp onsiveness to carbachol was observed following a 3-h exposure to 1.5-ppm NO 2, but not to intermittent peaks of 2.0 ppm (Frampton et al. 1991). Thus, the lower threshold concentration of NO 2 for causing increases in nonspecific airways responsiveness in healthy subjects appears to be in the 1- to 2-ppm range. Nonspecific Responsiveness in Asthmatic Individuals The 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen reporte d results from some early studies that suggested that NO 2 might enhance subsequent responsiveness to challenge by bronchoconstricting agents. This increase in airways responsiveness in asthmatics has been observed in some, but not all st udies, at relatively low NO 2 concentrations within the range of 0.2 to 0.3 ppm. Appearing in Tables 15-9 and 15-10 of the 1993 AQCD (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993), the meta-analysis by Folinsbee (1992) also provided suggestive evidence of increased airways respon siveness in asthmatics exposed to NO 2 concentrations of as August 2007 3-37 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 low as 0.1 ppm for 1 hour during rest. However, numerous studies had not reported independent effects of NO 2 on lung function in asthmatic individuals. Roger et al. (1990), in a comprehensive, con centration-response experiment, were unable to confirm the results of a pilot study suggesting airways responses occur in asthmatic subjects. Twenty-one male asthmatics exposed to NO 2 at 0.15, 0.30, or 0.60 ppm for 75 min did not experience significant effects on lung function or airways responsiveness compared with air exposure. Bylin et al. (1985) found significantly increased bronchial responsiveness to histamine challenge compared with sham exposure in 8 atopic asthmatics exposed to 0.30-ppm NO 2 for 20 min. Five of 8 asthmatics demonstrated in creased reactivity, while 3 subjects showed no change, as assessed by specific airways resist ance. Mohsenin (1987b) reported enhanced responsiveness to methacho line in 8 asthmatic subj ects exposed to 0.50-ppm NO 2 at rest for 1 h; airways responsiveness was measured by partial e xpiratory flow rates at 40% vital capacity, which may have increased the sens itivity for detecting small change s in airways responsiveness. J\u00f6rres and Magnussen (1991) found no effects on l ung function or methacholine responsiveness in 11 patients with mild asthma exposed to 0.25-ppm NO 2 for 30 min with 10 min of exercise. Strand et al. (1996) performed a series of studies in mild asthmatics exposed to 0.26 ppm for 30 min and found increased responsiveness to histam ine as well as to allergen challenge (see below). The effects of NO 2 exposure on SO 2-induced bronchoconstriction have been examined, but with inconsistent results . J\u00f6rres and Magnussen (1990) f ound an increase in airways responsiveness to SO 2 in asthmatic subjects following exposure to 0.25-ppm NO 2 for 30 min at rest, yet Rubinstein et al. (1990) f ound no change in responsiveness to SO 2 inhalation following exposure of asthmatics to 0.30-ppm NO 2 for 30 min with 20 min of exercise. The inconsistent results of these studies have not been satisfactorily explained. It is evident that a wide range of responses occurs among asthmatics exposed to NO 2. This variation may in part reflect differences in subjects and exposure protocols: mouthpiece versus chamber, obstructed versus non-obstructed asthmatics, se dentary versus exercise, and varying use of medication(s) among subjects. Identifica tion of factors that predispose to NO 2 responsiveness requires further investigation. These studies have typically involved volunteers with mild asthma; data are needed from mo re severely affected asthmatics who may be more susceptible. Overall, there is only suggestive evid ence that short-term exposures to NO 2 at outdoor ambient August 2007 3-38 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 concentrations (<0.25 ppm) significantly a lter lung function or nonspecific airways responsiveness in most people with mild asthma. However, it remains possible that more severe asthmatics, or individuals with particular sensitivity to NO 2 airways effects, would experience reductions in lung function or increased airw ays responsiveness when exercising outdoors at NO 2 concentrations of <0.25 ppm. Furthermore, outdoor levels influence indoor concentrations, which may reach peak levels that are clinically important for some adults and children with asthma. Allergen Responsiveness in Asthmatic Individuals In asthmatics, inhalation of an allergen to which an individual is sensitized can cause bronchoconstriction and increased a llergic airways inflammation, and this an important cause of asthma exacerbations. Aerosolized allergens can be used in controlled airways challenge testing in the laboratory, either clinically to identify specific allergens to which the individual is responsive or in research to investigate the pathog enesis of the airways al lergic response or the effectiveness of treatments. The degree of resp onsiveness is a function of the concentration of inhaled allergen, the degree of sensitization as measured by th e level of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, and the degree of nonspecific ai rways responsiveness (Cockcroft and Davis, 2006). It is difficult to predict th e level of responsiveness to an allergen, and rarely, severe bronchoconstriction can occur with i nhalation of very low concentra tions of allergen. Allergen challenge testing, therefore, invo lves greater risk than nonspecifi c airways challenge with drugs such as methacholine. Asthmatics may experien ce both an \"early\" response, with declines in lung function within minutes afte r the challenge, and a \"late\" res ponse, with a decline in lung function hours after the e xposure. The early response primaril y reflects release of histamine and other mediators by airways mast cells; the late response reflects enhanced airways inflammation and mucous production. Responses to allergen ch allenge are typically m easured as changes in pulmonary function, such as declines in FEV 1. However, the airways inflammatory response can also be assessed using BAL, induced sputum, or exhaled breath condensate. The potential for NO 2 exposure to enhance responsive ness to allergen challenge in asthmatics deserves special mention. Several recent studies, summarized in Annex Table AX5.3, have reported that low-level exposures to NO 2, both at rest and with exercise, enhance the response to specific allergen challenge in mild asthmatics. August 2007 3-39 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Tunnicliffe et al. (1994) expos ed 8 subjects with mild as thma to 0.1- or 0.4-ppm NO 2 for 1-h at rest and re ported that 0.4-ppm NO 2 exposure slightly increase d responsiveness to a fixed dose of allergen during both the early and late phases of the response. In two U.K. studies (Devalia et al., 1994; Rusznak et al., 1996) , exposure to the combination of 0.4-ppm NO 2 and 0.2-ppm SO 2 increased responsiveness to subsequent allergen challenge in mild atopic asthmatics, whereas, neither pollutant alone altered allergen responsiveness. A series of studies from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden have explored airways responses to allergen challenge in asthmatics. Strand et al. (1997) demonstrated that single 30-min exposures to 0.26-ppm NO 2 increased the late phase response to allergen challenge 4-h after exposure. In a separate study (Strand et al., 1998), 4 daily repeat ed exposures to 0.26-ppm NO 2 for 30 min increased both the early and late-phase responses to allergen. Barck et al. (2002) used the same exposure and challenge protocol in the earlier Strand studies (0.26 ppm for 30 min, with allergen challenge 4-h after exposur e), and performed BAL 19-h after exposure to determine NO 2 effects on the inflammatory res ponse to allergen challenge. NO 2 (0.26 ppm for 30 min) followed by allergen caused increases in the BAL recovery of PMN and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), with reduced volume of BAL fluid and reduced cell viability, compared with air followed by allergen. ECP is released by degranul ating eosinophils, is toxic to respiratory epithelial cells, and is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of airways injury in asthma. These findings indicate that NO 2 enhanced the airways inflammatory response to allergen. Subsequently, Barc k et al. (2005a) exposed 18 mild asthmatics to air or NO 2 for 15 min on day 1, followed by two 15-min exposures separated by 1-h on day 2, with allergen challenge after exposures on both days 1 and 2. Sputum was induced before exposure on day 1 and after exposures (morning of day 3). NO 2 + allergen, compared to air + allergen, treatment resulted in increased levels of ECP in both sputum and blood and increased myeloperoxidase levels in blood. A separate study examined NO 2 effects on nasal responses to nasal allergen challenge (Barck et al., 2005b). Si ngle 30-min to 0.26-ppm NO 2 did not enhance nasal allergen responses. All exposures in the Karolinska Institute stud ies (Barck et al., 2002, 2005a; Strand et al., 1997, 1998) used subjects at rest. These studies utilized an adequate number of subjects, included air control expos ures, randomized exposure order, and separated exposures by at least 2 weeks. Together, they appear to demonstrate convincingly effects of quite brief exposures to 0.26 ppm on allergen responsiveness in asthmatics. The level of August 2007 3-40 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 confidence in the findings from the Karolinska Institute would be further increased with confirmation from other laboratories. However, the findings may shed some light on the variable results in earlier studies of NO 2 effects on nonspecific airways respons iveness. It is possible that some prior studies may have been variably confounded by environmental allergen exposure, increasing the variability in subject responses to NO 2 and perhaps explaining some of the inconsistent findings. Several studies have been conducted using longer NO 2 exposures. Wang et al. (1995a,b, 1999) found that more intense (0.4 ppm) and prolonged (6 h) NO 2 exposures enhanced allergen responsiveness in the nasa l mucosa in subjects with allergic rhinitis. Jenkins et al. (1999) examined FEV 1 decrements and airways responsiveness to allergen in a group of mild, atopic asthmatics. The subjects were exposed for 3-h to NO 2 (400 ppb), O 3 (200 ppb), and NO 2 (400 ppb) + O 3 (200 ppb). The subjects were also exposed for 6-h to produce exposure concentrations that would provide identical doses to the 3-h prot ocols (i.e., equivalent C \u00d7 T). Significant increases in airways responsivene ss to allergen occurred following all the 3-h exposures, but not followi ng the 6-h exposures. Lastly, one study examined the effects on alle rgen responsiveness of exposure to traffic exhaust in a tunnel (Svartengren et al., 2000). Twenty mild asthma tics sat in a stationary vehicle within a busy tunnel for 30 min. Allergen cha llenge was performed 4-h later. The control exposure was in a hotel room in a suburban area with low air pollution levels. Exposures were separated by 4 weeks and the or der was randomized. Median NO 2 levels in the vehicle were 313 \u00b5g/m3 or 0.166 ppm, PM 10 levels were 170 \u00b5g/m3, and PM 2.5 levels were 95 \u00b5g/m3. Median NO 2 levels outside the hotel were 11 \u00b5g/m3. Subjects in the tunnel experienced increased cough, and also reported awareness of noise and odors. More importantly, there was a greater allergen- induced increase in specific airw ays resistance after the tunnel e xposure than afte r the control exposure (44% versus 31% respectively). Thoraci c gas volume was also increased to a greater degree after the tunnel exposure, suggesting increased gas trapping within the lung. These findings were most pronounced in the subjec ts exposed to the highest levels of NO 2. This study suggests that exposure to traffic exhaust, and particularly the NO 2 component, increases allergen responsiveness in asthmatics, and the results fit well w ith the findings in studies of clinical exposures of NO 2 (Barck et al., 2002, 2005a). However, it was not possible to blind the exposures, and the control exposure (hotel room , presumably quiet and relaxed) was not well August 2007 3-41 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 matched to the experimental exposure (vehicle, noisy, odorous). It remain s possible that factors other than NO 2 contributed to, or were responsible for, the observed differences in allergen responsiveness. These recent studies involving a llergen challenge suggest that NO 2 may enhance the sensitivity to allergen-induced decrements in lung function, and increase the allergen-induced airways inflammatory response. Enhancement of allergic responses in asthmatics occurs at exposure levels more than an order of magnit ude lower than those associated with airways inflammation in healthy subjects . The dosimetry difference is even greater when considering that the allergen challenge studies were ge nerally performed at rest, while the airways inflammation studies in healthy subjects were performed with intermittent exercise. Enhancement of allergen responses has been found at exposures as low as 8 ppm-min, i.e., 0.26 ppm for 30 min. Additional work is needed to understand more completely the exposure-response characteristics of NO 2 effects on allergen responses, as well as the effects of exercise, relationship to the severity of as thma, the role of asthma medicatio ns, and other clinical factors. Additional animal and in vitro studies are needed to establish the precise mechanisms involved. Toxicological Studies of Airways Responsiveness The 1993 AQCD found airways responsiveness to be a key health response to NO 2 exposure. Although the mechanisms are not fu lly known, many studies have demonstrated the ability of NO 2 exposure to increase bronchial sensitiv ity to various challenge agents. Acute exposures of Brown-Norway rats to NO 2 at a concentration of 9400 \u00b5g/m3 (5 ppm) for 3-h resulted in increased specific immune re sponse to house dust mite allergen and increased immune-mediated pulmonary inflammation (Gilmour et al., 1996). Higher levels of antigen- specific serum IgE, local IgA, IgG, and IgE were observed when rats were exposed to NO 2 after both the immunization and challeng e phase, but not after either the immunization or challenge phase alone. Increases in the number of in flammatory cells in the lungs and lymphocyte responsiveness to house dust mite allergen in the spleen and mediastinal lymph node were observed. The authors concluded that this incr eased immune responsiven ess to house dust mite allergen may be the result of the increased permeability of the lung caused by NO 2 exposure, enhancing translocation of the an tigen to local lymph nodes and circ ulation to other sites in the body.

Guinea pigs were given an intraperitoneal injection of C. albicans , followed by a second injection 4 weeks late r. Two weeks after the second injection, the animals were given an i nhalation exposure of killed C. albicans. Animals were also exposed 4 h/day to 8955-\u00b5g/m3 (4.76 ppm) NO 2 from the same day as the first injection of C. albicans for a total of 30 exposures (5 days/week). Pulmonary function (lung resistance, dyna mic compliance) was not affected in NO 2-exposed rabbits immunized intraperitoneally w ithin 24-h of birth until 3 months of age to either Alternaria tenuis or house dust mite antigen. The ra bbits were given intraperitoneal injections once weekly for 1 month, and then every 2 weeks thereafter, and exposed to 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (4 ppm) NO 2 for 2-h daily (Douglas et al., 1994). Kobayashi and Miura (1995) studi ed the concentration- and time-dependency of airways hyperresponsiveness to inhaled histamine aerosol in guinea pigs exposed subchronically to NO 2. In one experiment, guinea pigs were e xposed by inhalation to 0, 113, 940, or 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (0, 0.06, 0.5, or 4.0 ppm) NO 2, 24 h/day for 6 or 12 weeks. Immediately following the last exposure, airways hyperresponsiveness was a ssessed by measurement of specific airways resistance as a function of increasing concentratio ns of histamine aerosol. Animals exposed to 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (4 ppm) NO 2 for 6 weeks exhibited increased airways response to inhaled histamine aerosol; airways response at 12 weeks was not de termined. No effects were observed at the lower exposure levels. In another experiment conducted in this study (Kobayashi and Miura, 1995), guinea pigs were exposed by inhalation to 0, 1880-, 3760-, or 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (0, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 ppm) NO 2, 24 h/day for 6 or 12 weeks, and the airw ays hyperresponsiveness was determined. Increased hyperresponsiveness to inhaled hist amine was observed in animals exposed 7520 ppm) for 6 weeks; 3760 12 weeks; and 1880 \u00b5g/m3 (1 ppm) for 12 weeks only. The results al so showed that at 1880- or 3760-\u00b5g/m3 (1 or 2 ppm) NO 2, airways hyperresponsiveness developed to a higher degree with the passage of time. Therefore, a higher concentration of NO 2 induces airways hyperresponsiveness faster than a lower concentration. When the specific airways re sistance was compared to values determined 1 week prior to initiation of the NO 2 exposure, values were increased in the 3760- and August 2007 3-43 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 7520-\u00b5g/m3 (2.0 and 4.0 ppm) animals at 12 weeks only.

Hyperresponsiveness to a challenge agent is typically characterized by bronchoconstr iction subsequent to NO 2 compared to clean air exposure. Subchronic exposures (6 to 12 weeks) of animals to NO 2 (1 to 4 ppm) increases responsiveness to nonspecific challenge. Healthy humans exposed to NO 2 in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 ppm for a few hours also develop small but significant incr eases in nonspecific airways responsiveness. There is limited evidence that asthmatics may experience increased airw ays responsiveness to nonspecific challenge following exposu re to between 0.2- and 0.3-ppm NO 2 for 30 min. A meta- analysis of four studies provided suggestive ev idence of increased airw ays responsiveness in asthmatics exposed to 0.1-ppm NO 2 for 1 h. Data supporting increased airways responsiveness to specific allergen challenges following NO 2 exposure is more compelling. Bronchoconstriction following an allergen challenge occurs in asthmatics exposed during rest to 0.26-ppm NO 2 for 30 min relative to clean air. However, inflammatory responses to allergen challenge in asthmatics may be a more sensitive endpoint and have been reported subsequent to exposure at 0.26-ppm NO 2 for 30 min. These inflammatory responses to the allergen challenge were not accompanied by any changes in pulmonary function or subj ective symptoms. Increased immune-mediated pulmonary inflammation also occurs in rats exposed to house dust mite allergen following exposure to 5-ppm NO 2 for 3 h. Overall, studies involving allergen challenge suggest that NO 2 exposure increases the allergen -induced airways inflammatory response and may also enhance the sensitivity to allergen-induced decrements in lung function. 3.2.1.6 Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Visits for Respiratory Outcomes Total respiratory causes for emergency departme nt (ED) visits typi cally include asthma, COPD (including pneumonia, bronchitis, a nd emphysema), upper and lower respiratory infections such as influenza, and other minor categories. Morbiditie s that result in ED visits are closely related to, but are genera lly less severe than, those that result in unscheduled hospital admissions. In many cases, acute health problems are successfully treated in the ED; however, a August 2007 3-44 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 subset of more severe cases that present ini tially to the ED may requi re hospital admission and are then classified as hospital admissions. ED visits represent an important acute outcome that may be affected by NO 2 exposures. Many studies have been published in the past de cade that examined temporal associations between NO 2 exposures and ED visits and hospital admi ssions for respiratory diseases. Asthma visits typically dominate the daily incidence counts. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema often are combined to define COPD, which is a pr ominent diagnosis among older adults with lung disease. 3.3.1.6.1 All Respiratory Outcomes (ICD9: 460-519) Overall, the majority of studies that have examined all respiratory outcomes as a single group have focused on hospital admission data. Those studies are summarized here, along with a single study of ED visits and all respiratory outcomes. Two multicity studies that combine the effects of ambient air pollution (including NO 2) in several cities and describe similar response rates and respirat ory health outcomes as measured by increased hospital admissions are available (B arnett et al., 2005); (Sim pson et al., 2005a). These studies are summarized in Table 3.2-2. Barnett et al. (2005) used a case-crossover method to study ambient air pollution effects on respiratory hospital admissions of children (age groups 0, 1 to 4, and 5 to 14 years) in multiple cities in both Australia and New Zealand during the study period 1998-2001. For NO 2 the interquartile ranges for 1-h and 24-h NO 2 were 9.0 and 5.1 ppb, respectively. No significant associations were reported between NO 2 and hospital admission for infants or children 1 to 4 years old in these cities. Fo r all respiratory admissions among children 1 to 4 years, a 2.8% (95% CI: 0.7, 4.9) increase was found for a 9-ppb increment in the daily maximum 1-h concentration of NO 2, and for children aged 5 to14 years the same increase in NO 2 resulted in a 4.7% increase in admission for all respiratory di sease (95% CI: 1.6, 7.9) both lagged 0 to 1 day (Barnett et al., 2005). Multipollutant models in the study showed that the results for NO 2 were often independent of the effect s of other pollutants, although so me impact caused by particles and SO 2 could not be separated from those found for NO 2. For respiratory admissions in the 5- to 14-year age group, a signi ficant association with PM 10 disappeared after adjusting for NO 2, indicating that this re sult could not be separated from that for NO 2. However, the association with NO 2 remained after adjusting for PM 10.

(2005a) examined the response to a change in the maximum daily 1-h concentration equivalent to the average IQR of the four cities (54.5 ppb). The calculated relative risk (RR, expressed per ppb) (1.0027 [95% CI: 1.0015, 1.0039] lag 0 to 1) was small, but statistically significant. Th e authors present results from three statistical models that produced similar results overall for the four cities. Perth generally experienced much lower 1-h maximum concentrations of NO 2 than the other Australian cities. In their analysis of two-pollutant models , Simpson et al. (2005a) reported that concentrations of NO 2 and particulate matter (PM 10) may be associated with similar outcomes or effects. There was clear evidence of heterogene ity of response across di fferent cities within similar age groups to the same pollutant mixtures. For respiratory hospitalization the city that provided the greatest source of hete rogeneity, Perth, was the same in each of the three statistical model approaches applied. Simps on et al. (2005a) suggest that a po ssible source of variation of response could lie in the population characteristics (age, structure, etc.) that differentiate one urban population from another. They concluded th at it might not be reasonable to generalize health outcomes in response to pollutants experi enced in one urban location to another location. Several North American studies have examined ED visits and hospital admissions for all respiratory causes and ambient NO 2 concentrations (Linn et al., 2000; Peel et al., 2005; Luginaah et al., 2005; Fung et al., 2006). These studies have generally focu sed on adults and the elderly. (See Figure 3.2-8.) Among adults (>30 years of age) living in a large area of Los Angeles, Linn et al. (2000) noted seasonal associations between NO 2 levels (mean 24-h average NO 2: 34 ppb) and the frequency of hospitalization for all pulmonary disease. Though associations were positive for each of the four seasons, the associations for autumn and winter were markedly higher. It was noted that these single-pollutant results could not be distingui shed from effects related to copollutants PM 10 and CO (Linn et al., 2000). Peel et al. (2005) examined ED visits for a ll respiratory causes among all ages in relation to ambient NO 2 concentrations in Atlanta, GA; they found a 1.6% (95% CI: 0.6, 2.7) increase in respiratory ED visits associated wi th a 20-ppb increase in 1-h maximum NO 2 concentrations.

(2006) used time-series analysis, the method of Dewanji and Moolgavkar (2000), and case-crossover analysis of all respiratory hos pitalizations for adults aged 65 and older. All three methods showed positive associations between incremental changes in NO 2 of 5.43 ppb (IQR) from a mean concentration of 16.83 ppb. Using a time-series analysis Fung et al. (2006) reported a RR of 1.018 ([ 95% CI: 1.003, 1.034] lag 0) while the case- crossover analysis showed a significant change in the relative rate of 1.028 ([95% CI: 1.010, 1.04] lag 0). These represented percent change s of 1.8% and 2.8% respectively. The Dewanji and Moolgavkar model did not produce a stat istically significant association between NO 2 and hospitalization for the IQR of 5.43 ppb (RR = 1.012 1.027] lag 0)]. Results of multipollutant models were not given, but there were strong correlations of NO 2 with CO (r = 0.74), SO 2, PM 10, and PM 10-2.5 (Fung et al., 2006). In the Windsor/Detroit border area of Cana da, Luginaah et al. (2005) noted a positive trend between an incremental change in NO 2 of 16 ppb (mean 1-h maximum: 38.9 ppb) and August 2007 3-47 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 respiratory admissions. These authors used two approaches that include d both time-series and case-crossover analyses segregated by sex. T hough associations for females in each of the age groups examined were positive, the authors found only one statistically si gnificant association in females aged 0 to 14 years that identified an increased percent of hospitaliz ation of 18.9% using the case-crossover analysis (RR = 1.189 [95% CI : 1.002, 1.411] lag 2). In this study, CO and NO 2 were correlated (r = 0.38) and thought to represent motor vehicle emissions. Studies from Europe on associations with respiratory hospitaliza tion were conducted in London, Paris, and in Drammen, Norway. A detailed analysis of respiratory hospitalization by age group and by seasonal temperature was carri ed out in London using the APHEA protocol (Ponce de Leon et al., 1996). In this study, significant positive rela tive risks were reported for all ages and for children (0 to 14 year olds), but the presence of O 3 during summer months may have also contributed to a change in the rate of hospitalization. Respiratory hospitalizations for adults (15 to 64 years) examined separately were not statistically significantly increased. The increased hospitalization rates were based on an incremental change for NO 2 of 27 ppb (similar to the difference of the 90th a nd 10th percentiles of the annual concentration) and an annual mean 24-h concentration of 37.3 ppb in London. In Paris, France (mean 24-h average NO 2 of 23.6 ppb), Dab et al. (1996) determined that there was no statistically signi ficant association between admissions for all respiratory causes combined based on an incremental change of 52.35 ppb, though the estimates were positive. In Drammen, Norway, Oftedal et al. (2003) reported associations between respiratory hospitalizations and NO 2. Oftedal et al. (2003) reported that both NO 2 and benzene were associated with an increase in hospital admission for all respiratory disease. In a single-pollutant model, the relative rate of hospitalization for all respiratory disease increased based on an increment of 11-ppb NO 2 (RR = 1.060 [95% CI: 1.017, 1.105] lag 3 days). This finding was robust, since in two-pollutant models NO 2 remained associated with a significant increase in admissions after adjusting for PM 10 (RR = 1.063 [95% CI: 1.008, 1.120]) [95% CI: 1.002, 1.091]). Other studies outside the United States found positive outcomes (Llorca et al., 2005; Braga et al., 2001; Wong et al., 1999). 3.2.1.6.2 Asthma (ICD9: 493) In North America, the most recent studies to investigate for evidence of an association between ambient concentrations of NO 2 and hospitalizations or ED visits were conducted by August 2007 3-48 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Linn et al. (2000); Lin et al. ( 2003, 2004); Jaffe et al. (2003); P eel et al. (2005); and Tolbert et al. (2000). Mean concentrations of NO 2 in studies of hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma in North America varied from city to city. The mean daily concentrations were relatively low in Canada, recorded at 25.24 ppb (SD 9.04) in Toronto, ON from 1981 to 1993, and 18.65 ppb (SD 5.59) in Vancouver, BC from 1987 to 1991. In Atlanta, GA between 1993 and 1995, the mean of the daily 1-h maximum concentration wa s 81.7 ppb (SD 53.8) (Tolbert et al., 2000) but decreased between 1993 and 2000 to 45.9 ppb (SD 17.3) (Peel et al., 2005). During studies carried out between 1991 and 1996, the mean of the 24-h average NO 2 concentration in Cincinnati was 50 ppb (SD 15) and 48 ppb (SD 16) in Cleveland (Jaffe et al., 2003). Surprisingly, the lowest concentrations were reported by Linn et al (2000), who calculated the overall mean in Los Angeles, CA from 1992 to 1995 to be 3.4 ppb (SE 1.3). Linn et al. (2000) found significant increases (1.14% [95% CI: 0.9, 1.9]) in hospital admissions for asthma with a 10 ppb change in the 24-h average concentration of NO 2 in Los Angeles (mean 24-h NO 2: 34 ppb). When seasonal differences in hospitalization frequency were examined, higher rates of hospitalization for asthma in Los Angeles were found for the cooler months of autumn (1.9% [95% CI: 1.1, 2 .7]), and winter 2.7, 2.9]) based on a 10 ppb change in the concentration of NO 2 (Linn et al., 2000). Lin et al. examined the data for hospital admi ssions due to asthma in the Canadian cities of Toronto (Linn et al., 2003) and Vancouver (L inn et al., 2004). Lin et al. (2004) studied gaseous air pollutants and 3,822 asthma hos pitalizations (2,368 boys, 1,454 girls) among children 6 to 12 years of age with low household income in Vancouver, Canada between 1987 and 1998. NO 2 levels were derived from 30 mon itoring stations. Exposures to NO 2 were found to be significantly and positively associated w ith asthma hospitalization for males in the low socioeconomic group but not in the high socioeconomic group. This effect did not persist among females. Lin et al. (2003) c onducted a case-crossover analysis of the effect of short-term exposure to gaseous pollution on 7,319 asthma hospitalizations (4,629 boys, 2,690 girls) in children in Toronto between 1980 and 1994. NO 2 concentrations measured from four monitoring stations were positively associated with asthma admissions in both sexes. The effects of NO 2 on asthma hospitalization remained after adjust ment for PM. Differences in the results of these two studies might be attributed to differences in the study designs.

For the 24-h NO 2 concentration, the estimate was 17.5% (RR = 1.175 [95% CI: 1.059, 1.304] lag 0 to 1); while for a similar incremental change in the 1-h maximum concentration of NO 2, the increase in admissions for asthma was 8.1% (RR = 1.081 [95% CI: 1.019, 1.148] lag 0 to 1). In Atlanta, GA, Peel et al. (2005) examined various respirat ory ED visits in relation to pollutant levels from 1 January 1993 to 31 A ugust 2000. The pollutants and metrics for this analysis were selected a priori based on cu rrent hypotheses regard ing potentia lly causal pollutants and components with a focus on PM aspects (Albritton and Greenbaum, 1998; Schlesinger, 2000) as well as usef ul models for primary traffic related pollutants. The mean daily count of asthma ED vis its for asthma was 39.0 \u00b1 20.5 over th e entire study period. Results for the a priori single-pollutant models examining a 3-day moving average (lag 0, 1, and 2) of NO 2 showed a small but not statis tically significant associations with asthma visits (RR = 1.014 [95% CI: 0.997, 1.030) for all age groups. In secondary analysis of patients ages 2 to 18 years, a 20-ppb increase in the day 5 lag of the NO 2 concentration yielded an RR of 1.027 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.000). Wade et al. (2006) examined the effects of instrument precision and spatial variability on assessment of the temporal variation of ambient air pollution (including NO 2) in Atlanta. The use of calculated instrument data yielded an estimate of instrument imprecision equal to 20% of the temporal variation for NO x and PM 2.5 mass and 10% of O 3 and CO. The spatial variability was approximately 80% of th e temporal variation for NO x. Population-weight ed uncertainty in primary pollutant levels because of instrument imprecision and spatial variation was found to be 60 to 70% of the temporal variation. Note that these ambient air pollutant error estimates have not been incorporated into the health risk models by Peel et al., (2005) and are expected to appear in a later publication. Jaffe et al. (2003) examined the effects of ambient pollutants during the summer months (June through August) on the daily number of ED visits for asthma among Medicaid recipients aged 5 to 34 years from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1996 in Cincinnati and Cleveland.

A number of studies outside of North America have examined the association between NO 2 and hospitalization or ED visits for asthma . Barnett et al., (2005) examined specific respiratory disease outcomes and did not find a ssociations between incremental changes in NO 2 concentration and respiratory admissions for asthma among children 1 to 4 years old. The largest association found in this study was a 6.0% increase in as thma admissions in the 5- to 14-year age group related to a 5.1-ppb increase in 24-h NO 2, with evidence of a seasonal impact that resulted in larger increas es in admissions during the warm season. When the same groups were examined for the effect of a 9.0-ppb ch ange in the maximum 1-h concentration of NO 2, there were no significant associations between NO 2 and hospitalization for asthma. Tenias et al. (1998) used the APHEA design and analysis appr oach in Valencia, Spain, to examine the association between hospital ED visits for asthma among patients over 14 years old and air pollution for the period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1995, yielding 734 cases. The mean 24-h NO 2 level was 57.7 \u00b5g/m3 and the mean 1-h NO 2 level was 100.1 \u00b5g/m3. There were 7.6% and 3.7% increases in ED visits associated with the 24-h average NO 2 concentration at lag 0 (1.076 [95% CI: 1.020, 1.134]) Examina tion of single- and two-polluta nt models shows that the addition O 3, smoke, or SO 2 into the model results in little variation in the NO 2 effect estimates, thus diminishing the effect of confounding on the NO 2 effect estimates. Castellsague et al. (1995) examined the asso ciation between hospital emergency visits for asthma and air pollutants during the winter and summer months from 198 5 to 1989 in Barcelona, Spain for the 14 to 65 year age group. Barcelona traffic density on working day shows little variability during the year, sugge sting a steady emission of vehicl e exhaust, which is the main source of NO 2 in the city. There were 460 summer asthma visits and 452 winter visits. Mean NO 2 levels averaged 104.0 \u00b5g/m3 (95th percentile = 183 \u00b5g/m3) during 100.8 \u00b5g/m3 (95th percentile = 153 \u00b5g/m3) during the winter. The increase in asthma visits for a 25-\u00b5g/m3 increase of current day levels of NO 2 was 4.5% (95% CI: 0.9, 8.1) in summer and 5.6% (95% CI: 1.1, 10.4) in winter . A cumulative measure of NO 2 yielded a slightly stronger association.

For children aged 1 to 14, a 5.3% increase in hospital admissions for asthma ([95% CI: 1.1, 9.7] lag 0) was associat ed with the daily 1-h maximum value based on 15-ppb incremental change. This association with the 1-h maximum daily concentration remained robust in a multiple pollutant model (5.95% [95% CI: 1.11, 11.02] lag 0) which was only marginally different from the single-po llutant model (Morgan et al., 1998a). The association with adults also was positive, but not statistically significant. Studies of ED visits for asthma have been reported from cities in Europe including London (Atkinson et al., 1999a,b; Ha jat et al., 1999); Belfast (Thom pson et al., 2001); Valencia, Barcelona, and Madrid, Spain (Ten ias et al., 1998; Galan et al., 2003; Castellsague et 2005); Marseille, (Boutin-Forzano et al., 2004); and Amsterdam and Rotterdam (Schouten et al., 1996). Sunyer et al. (1997) ha ve described a meta- analysis of several ci ties under the umbrella of the APHEA protocol (Katsouyanni et al., 1996). Additional cities where associations between ED visits for asthma and ambient concentrations of NO 2 have been examined include Melbourne, Bris bane and Perth, Australia (Erbas et al., 2005; Hinwood et al., 2006), and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (Farhat et al., 2005). Figures 3.2-9 and 3.2-10 show th e percent increases (and 95% c onfidence limits) in visits to the ED for asthma associated with daily NO 2 1-h peaks and 24-h averages for each study, respectively. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to summarize these results. The results of meta-regression show that the percent increases did not vary significantly for adults versus children, the sampling time of NO 2, or the daily NO 2 concentration for each sampling time. The lags presented in the figures vary depending on reported results. Most studies reported effect estimates from a short lag period (i.e., 0 to 2 days). Figure 3.2-11 provides three examples of dos e response relationships for the effect estimates of asthma visits to the ED and NO 2 concentrations. Jaffe et al. (2003) found a positive association between ambient NO 2 and asthma ED visits among Me dicaid-enrolled asthmatics in two urban cities in Ohio. When a concentratio n-response relationship was examined by quintile of NO 2 concentration, risk decreased in the second quintile and increased monotonically in the third and fourth quintiles in Cleveland, but were less smooth in Cincinnati.

Specifically, the adjusted risk estimat es of asthma visits for each quartile of NO 2 showed increased risks in each quartile, although the increase was not monotonic. Increased trends were apparent in both su mmer and winter for the second quartile, suggesting that if any threshold level exists, it may be quite low. COPD (ICD9: 490-496) Studies examining COPD outcomes have fo cused on hospital admission data, including multicity studies in the United States (Moolga vkar, 2000), Europe (Anderson et al., 1997) and August 2007 3-54 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Australia (Simpson et al., 2005a), and single-city studies in Canada (Ya ng et al., 2005), Europe (Dab et al., 1996), and Aust ralia (Morgan et al., 1998). Moolgavkar (2003) reported statistically significant associ ations between NO 2 and COPD admissions in two U.S. counties, with approximately 2% increases in Cook County, IL and Los Angeles County, CA associated with a 10-ppm increase in NO 2. Multipollutant models adjusted for PM 10 and PM 2.5 attenuated these estimates slightly, though they remain ed statistically significant. Anderson et al. (1997) examin ed COPD admissions in six European cities with mean 24-h average and daily 1-h maximum NO 2 concentrations ranging from 22 to 35 ppb and 33.5 to 51.3 ppb, respectively. Admissions in Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, Paris, and Rotterdam during different periods fr om 1977 to 1991 were analyzed for association with NO 2 by season (warm or cool) or for the entire year and usi ng an incremental change of 26 ppb for either the daily 1-h maximum or the 24-h average concentr ation. The APHEA protocol (time series) was employed in data analysis. The authors report ed associations between hospital admissions for COPD and 24-h average NO 2 during the warm season (RR = 1.03 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.06] lag 1) and 1-h (RR = 1.02 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.05] la g 1). Significant risks for hospitalization for obstr uctive respiratory diseases were found year round for both the 24-h average and the daily 1-h maximum value for NO 2 (Anderson et al., 1997). No multipollutant models were described for this meta-analysis, but black smoke, O 3, and SO 2 all appeared to be responsible for an increased frequency of admi ssions. The authors reported some heterogeneity of association between cities. When the authors investigated individual cities, only London, with a 26-ppb increase in NO 2 was clearly significantly positive on its own for increased hospital admissions for COPD. Amsterdam showed no association between NO 2 and COPD admissions. Simpson et al. (2005a) report small but statis tically significant a ssociations between incremental changes in NO 2 and COPD among patients $65 years using hosp italization data from four Australian cities (0.3% increase [95% CI: 0.15, 0.39). Th e analysis of admissions in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth sought to compare three modeling approaches for outcomes including generalized additive models (GAM), GLM and a penalized spline model. The authors found significant hete rogeneity of response among results in different cities.

Yang et al. (2005) reported that NO 2 was the strongest predictor of ho spital admissions for COPD in single- pollutant models; however, in two- pollutant models with either PM 10 or CO, the effect of NO 2 was attenuated and lost significance. A time-series analysis in Sydney, Australia, examined respiratory outcomes in children and adults, but generally failed to show an association between changes in NO 2 (24-h average) for increased hospital admi ssions among COPD patients $65 years (Morgan et al., 1998a). Similarly, a study in Paris, France, of COPD and related obstructive re spiratory disease found that NO 2 was not statistically significantly associat ed with increased hospital admissions (Dab et al., 1996). Multipollutant Modeling Results Several studies of the relationship between ambient NO 2 concentrations and ED visits evaluated copollutant models (Sunyer et al., 1997; Atkinson et al., 1999b; Galan et al., 2003). Individual models including NO 2 and black smoke (Sunyer et al., 1997; Atkinson et al., 1999b), SO 2 (Sunyer et al., 1997; Atkinson et al., 1999b; Galan et al., 2003) , CO (Atkinson et al., 1999b), PM 10 (Atkinson et al., 1999b; Galan et al., 2003), or O 3 (Atkinson et al., 1999b) did not produce effect estimates that were si gnificantly different than thos e produced when using the single- pollutant model. Respiratory ED visit and hospital ad mission studies obser ved consistent NO 2 risk estimates with the inclusion of SO 2, O3, and PM constituents (B urnett et al., 1997b, 1999; Lee et al., 2006). In one of these studies (Burnett et al., 1997), the effect of NO 2 was adjusted for SO 42! and coefficient of haze (CoH). With the addition of SO 42! in the model, the risk estimate for NO 2 on respiratory hospitalizations remained rela tively stable; however, the inclusion of the CoH term in the model yielded an attenuated risk estimate. In field studies, power to assess independent NO 2 effects may be limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up times. Yet, the NO 2 effect was not as r obust to the addition of copollutants in multipollutant models, with a few exceptions. For example, in Schwartz et al. (1994), the significant association between cough and 4-day mean NO 2 remained unchanged in models that included O 3 but was attenuated and lost sign ificance in two-pollutant models August 2007 3-56 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 including PM 10 or SO 2. In Mortimer et al. (2002), eff ects were attenuated in multipollutant models that included O 3; O3 and SO 2; or O 3, SO 2, and PM 10. In Schildcrout et al. (2006), each 20-ppb increase in NO 2 increased risk of cough (OR 1.09 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.15). This result was unchanged in two-pollutant models with CO, PM 10, or SO 2. Multipollutant regression analyses indicated that NO 2 risk estimates, in general, were not sensitive to the inclusion of c opollutants, including CO and SO 2. There is limited evidence that PM 10 or other ambient particle cons tituents do have an effect on NO 2 risk estimates. These results suggest that the effect of NO 2 on respiratory health outcomes appears to be robust and independent of the effects of other gaseous c opollutants but that ambi ent particles may confound NO 2 effects on health. Summary Overall, there is strong evidence that incr eased ED visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, including asth ma and COPD, are associated w ith ambient concentrations of NO 2. Still, it is important to note that there uncertainty remains regarding the role of NO 2 as a surrogate for other pollutants, wh ich could confound results presented in this section. In nearly all of these studies, there was ev idence of correla tions between NO 2 and CO and PM measures. Some authors found statistically significant associations between asthma ED visits or hospital admissions and NO 2 in single-pollutant models and subseque ntly examined these associations in two- or multipollutant models. In S\u00e3o Paulo, asthma remained strongly associated with NO 2 after adjustment for PM 10 and SO 2, but not when CO was included in the model (Farhat et al., 2005). In Madrid, significant association with NO 2 remained after adjustment for SO 2 but not PM 10 (Galan et al., 2003). Similarly, in Turin, ad justment for total suspended particulate (TSP)- attenuated effects of NO 2 (Migliaretti et al ., 2004) demonstrating that th e responses to individual pollutant species were not independent. In a meta-analysis of four cities in the APHEA project, NO 2 remained associated with asthma for adults after adjustment for the effects of black smoke (Sunyer et al., 1997). In associations be tween ED visits to hospitals and NO 2, Atkinson et al. (1999a) found that effects of NO 2 remained after adjustment for SO 2, CO, PM 10, or black smoke.

This conclusion is based on findings from numerous new epidemiological studies, including multipollutant studies that control fo r the effects of other pollutants, and is supported by evidence from toxicological and controlled human exposure studies. The body of evidence from epidemiological st udies has grown substantially since the 1993 AQCD. The strongest new epidemiological evidence is for associations with increased ED visits and hospital admissions for respiratory cause s, especially asthma and COPD, with ambient concentrations of NO 2. In nearly all of these studies, there were high correlations between ambient measures of NO 2 and CO and PM. The effect estimates for NO 2 were robust after the inclusion of CO and PM in multipollutant mode ls, as shown in Figure 3.2-12. Looking within the new epidemiological findings, there is evidence of coherence for respiratory effects in the associations between short-term NO 2 exposure and respiratory sy mptoms and ED visits or hospital admissions for respiratory diseases, pa rticularly asthma. Recent studies reporting associations between indoor and personal exposure to NO 2 and respiratory symptoms or lung function provide key support for epidemiological findings of associations with ambient NO 2 concentrations (e.g., Pilotto et al., 2004). In pa rticular, an intervention study (Pilotto et al., 2004) provides strong evidence of a detr imental effect of exposure to NO 2. Evidence from experimental studi es provides plausibility for effects on the respiratory system with NO 2 exposure. Toxicological studies have shown that lung host defenses, including mucociliary clearance and AM and other immune cell functions, are sensitive to NO 2 exposure, with numerous measures of such effects observe d at concentrations below 1 ppm. These are potential mechanisms underlying more frank effects observed in epidemiological studies, such as hospital admissions or ED visits for respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, or respiratory infections.

The limited evidence from controlled human exposure studies indicates that NO 2 may increase susceptibility to injury by subsequent viral challenge. Controlled human exposure studies provide strong evidence for airways responsiveness with short-term exposure to NO 2; however, they do not provide compelling evidence for other respiratory effects, such as changes in lung function or subjective respiratory symptoms.

Normal animals do not respond until exposed to much higher levels, i.e., 5-ppm NO 2. Recent epidemiological studies provi de somewhat mixed evidence on short- term exposure to NO 2 and inflammatory responses in th e airways. The controlled human exposure studies provide evidence for airways inflammation at NO 2 concentrations of <2.0 ppm; the onset of inflammatory responses in h ealthy subjects appears to be between 100 and 200 ppm-min, i.e., 1 ppm for 2 to 3 h. The biochemical effects observed in the re spiratory tract following exposure to NO 2 include chemical alteration of lipids, ami no acids, proteins, enzymes, and changes in oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis, with membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids and thiol groups as the main biochemical targets for NO 2 exposure. However, the biol ogical implications of such alterations are unclear. Asthma is the respiratory illness for which mo st evidence is available. The following section provides further integrative discussion w ith a particular focus on the epidemiological and experimental study findings relevant to asthmatics. Integration with a Focus on Asthma Asthmatic Children There is strong evidence from epidemiologi cal studies for an association between NO 2 exposure and children's hos pital admissions, ED visits, and calls to doctors for asthma. This evidence came from large longit udinal studies, panel studies, and time-series studies. NO 2 exposure is associated with aggravation of as thma effects that include symptoms, medication use, and lung function. Effects of NO 2 on asthma were most evident with cumulative lag of 2 to 6 days, rather than same-day levels of NO 2. Time-series studies also demonstrated a relationship in children between hospital admissions or ED visits for asthma and NO 2 exposure, even after correcting for PM and CO concentrations. As discussed in Section 3.2.1.3, large, longitudinal cohort studies in the United States, Canada and Europe have reported signif icant associations between level of NO 2 and risk of respiratory symptoms in children, particularly asthmatic children. A number of recent panel studies of asthmatic children have also gene rally reported significan t associations between respiratory symptoms and NO 2 exposure. The effects were ob served with lag periods ranging August 2007 3-60 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 from 2 days to a 6-day moving average for NO 2, suggesting that NO 2 may not only be directly triggering asthma attach\u00e9, but may also be acting indirectly as a primer for subsequent antigen exposure. Important evidence is also available from epidemiological studies of indoor NO 2 exposures. A number of recent studies show associations with wheeze, chest tightness, and length of symptoms (Belanger et al., 2006); respiratory symptom rates (Nitschke et al., 2006); school absences (Pilotto et al., 1997a); respirat ory symptoms, likelihood of chest tightness, and asthma attacks (Smith et al., 2000); and severity of virus-induced asthma (Chauhan et al., 2003). However, several studies (Mukala et al., 1999, 2000; Farrow et al., 1997) evaluating younger children found no association between indoor NO 2 and respiratory symptoms. Human clinical studies of the health effects of NO 2 have not been conducted on children; however, toxicological studies provide strong biological plausi bility of the effects of NO 2 exposure on asthma exacerbation in children. Se veral endpoints in these studies point to mechanisms by which NO 2 can produce these adverse health effects. These mechanisms include reduced mucociliary clearance, AM function, such as depressed phagocytic activity and altered humoral- and cell-mediated immunity. NO 2 effects on AMs at levels as low as l.0 ppm are especially relevant to effects se en with asthmatics. This exposure causes decreased bactericidal activity, reduced cell viability, di sruption of membrane integrity and reduced cell number. These are all mechanisms that can provide biological plausibility for the NO 2 effects in asthmatic children observed in epidemiological studies. Ch auhan et al. (2003) have reviewed potential mechanisms by which NO 2 exacerbates asthma in the presence of viral infections. They include \"direct effects on the upper and lower airways by ciliary dyskinesis, epith elial damage, increases in IgE concen or indirectly through impa irment of bronchial immunity.\" As stated above, asthma is a chronic inflam matory disorder. Animal studies provide strong evidence that NO 2 can produce inflammation and lung permeability changes. One limitation of this work is that effects on marker s of inflammation, such as BAL fluid levels of total protein and lactate dehydroge nase, and recruitment or pro liferation of leukocytes, occur only at exposure levels of $5 ppm. Studies conducted at thes e higher exposure concentrations may elicit mechanisms of action and effects that do not occur at near-a mbient levels of NO 2.

Epidemiological studies show a strong association between NO 2 exposures and asthma symptoms in adult asthmatics. Outdoor NO 2 studies in Europe found an increased risk of shortness of breath (Hiltermann et al., 1998); prevalence for wheeze, phlegm, cough, and breathing problems upon waking (Von Klot et al., 2002); and severe asthma symptoms (Forsberg et al., 1998) associated with NO 2 levels. Several indoor NO 2 exposure studies have shown associations, as well. Endpoint s include likelihood of cough (Smith et al., 2000) and rescue medication use (Ng et al., 2001). Controlled human exposure studies are limited to acute, fully reversible functional and/or symptomatic responses and are further limited to exposures of only mild asthmatics. Increased airways responsiveness, the most sensitive indicator of response, occurred with resting exposures of 0.2 to 0.5-ppm NO 2. Other studies showed an absence of effects on airways responsiveness at much higher concentrations, up to 4 ppm. Lung function effects are vari able and inconsistent; however, there is little evidence for effects at <0.25 ppm. Ther e is no obvious explanation for the apparent lack of concentra tion-response relationship; therefore, the findings do not provide clear quantitative conclusions about the health effects of short-term exposures to NO 2. Effects at lower levels are seen in the epid emiological studies described above. 3.2 CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT- TERM NO 2 EXPOSURE 3.2.2.1 Studies of Hospital Admissions and Emergency Department Visits for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Our current review includes approximately 40 studies published since 1992 that address the effect of NO x exposure on hospitalizations or ED visits for CVD. No studies were reviewed that linked CVD hospital admissions or emergency visits with exposure to NO x prior to the release of the document in 1993. Cases of C VD are typically identified using ICD codes recorded on hospital discha rge records. However, counts of hospital or ED admissions are also used. Studies of ED visits include cases that are less severe than those that have been documented to require hospitalization via discharge records and these studies are clearly August 2007 3-62 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 distinguished in the annex tables. All CVD dia gnoses or selected diagnoses for diseases or disease grouping such as myocar dial infarction (MI), ischemic heart disease pectoris, cardiac arrh ythmia, cerebrovascular di seases, or stroke are outcomes considered in the analyses. All CVD (ICD9 390-459) All studies of the associati on of hospitalizations or ED visits are positive and most confidence limits exclude the null value, with the exception of the lag 1 results for the elderly reported by Jalaludin et al., 2006. Results from these studies are summarized in Figure 3.2-13. However, findings from multicity studies conduc ted in Spain (Ballester et al., 2006) and Australia (Barnett et al., 2006) i ndicate weak associat ions in single-pollutant models, which are attenuated in multipollutant m odels. Analyses from a study c onducted in Los Angeles and Cook Counties (Moolgavkar et al., 2003), also show an increase in hospital admissions for CVD associated with NO 2 that was diminished in multipollutant models. Associations were also diminished with the use of increasingly stringent convergence cr iteria applied for subsequent reanalyses (Moolgavkar, 2003). Another la rge multiyear study conducted in Los Angeles County reports a small increase in CVD admi ssions, but authors could not distinguish independent effects of specific pollutants (Linn et al., 2000). Pekkanen et al. (2000) reports an association between plasma fi brinogen, a risk factor and possible biomarker for cardi ovascular disease, and NO 2 (See Section 3.1.2.3). In addition, findings from controlled human exposure and animal studies may provide limited biological plausibility and mechanistic evidence for the epidemiology findings. These studies evaluated cardiovascular endpoints such as blood pressure , cardiac output and hematological parameters (Folinsbee et al., et et al., 1978; al., 2002; al., 1981, et al., 1973; Kunimoto et al., 1984; Takano et al., 2004). Heart Disease (ICD9 390-429) Some investigators distinguish heart diseases from diseases of the cerebrovascular system, involving blood vessels supplying blood to the brain, in th eir research. Findings from studies conducted in Canada and the Detroit area report positive associations of heart disease with NO 2 that are diminished in two-pollutant mo dels (Fung et al., 2005; Burnett et al., 1997a, 1999).

A 20-ppb increase in 24-h average NO 2 level was associated (RR = 1.14 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.21) with an increase in hospital admissions among the elderly in five cities in Aust ralia and New Zealand (Barnett et al., 2006). Daily maximum NO 2 level was associated with a similar increase in hospitalizations (2.8% (95% CI: 1.38, 4.26) per increase of 9.3-ppb NO 2) among the elderly of Sydney, Australi a (Jalaludin et al., 2006). Daily 1-h maximum NO 2 level was associated with increases in hospitalizations among the elderly (RR: 1.06 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.08] per 30-ppb increase in NO 2) (Simpson et al., 2005a). Increases in admissions were also reported for all ages (Jal aludin et al., 2006; Simpson et al., 2005a). An earlier study also yielded positive results with an increase of 20 ppb in the 24-h average NO 2 level associated with a RR of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.14) increase in cardiac admissions among all ages and similar increase among the elderly (M organ et al., 1998a). Results were diminished slightly when the 1-h maximum NO 2 level was used (Morgan et al., 1998a). Some results remained robust in two-polluta nt models (Simpson et al., 2005a; Morgan et al., 1998a) while results report ed in other studies were attenua ted by the inclusion of CO in multipollutant models (Jalaludin et al., 2006; Barnett et al., 2006). Two Asian case crossover studies (Chang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2004) report increases in cardiac disease that are robust in multipollutant models. However, the effects reported by Yang et al. were orders of magnitude above results reported in other studies (Yang et al., 2006). A time-series analysis conducted in Hong Kong reported small associat ions that were not robust in multipollutant models (Wong et al., 1999). Arrhythmia (ICD9 427) Arrhythmia is variation from the normal heart rhythm. Ventricu lar arrhythmias cause most sudden cardiac deaths while atrial fibrilla tion or supraventricular arrhythmia, the most common type of arrhythmia, is not a direct threat to life (Dockery et al ., 2005). However, risk factors for atrial fibrillation in clude hypertension, coronary arte ry disease and COPD and atrial fibrillation is associated with increased risk of stroke. Hospital or ED admissions for arrhythmia were inconsistently associated with increases in ambient NO 2 level. Some studies report positive a ssociations (Rich et al., 2006a; Mann et al., 2002; Barnett et al., 2006) while others report null associations (Metzger et al., 2004; Lippmann et al., 2000; reanalysis Ito, 2003, 2004) .

Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) ICD9 410-414 Some studies further delineate cardiac dis ease by using groupings of specific conditions such as IHD, which includes acute MI, previous MI, angina pectoris, an d other chronic IHD. Figure 3.2-14 summarizes studies that include hosp italization for IHD as an outcome. Two U.S. studies report associ ations of IHD hospitalizations or ED visits with ambient NO 2 level (Mann et al., 2002; Metzger et al., 2004) , while another reports no association (Lippmann et al., 2000; reanalysis Ito, 2003, 2004). The study by Mann et al. (2002) was novel, because exposures were assigned based on proximity to the monitoring stati on and results were pooled across air basins. Independent NO 2 effects were not distinguished in th ese studies, however (Mann et al., 2002; Metzger et al., 2004). Figure 3.2-14.

In a multicity study in Europe, a 4.2-ppb increase NO 2 was associated with an increase in readmission for angina pectoris (ICD9 411, 413) among cardiac patients (von Klot et al., 2005). O 3 may have been contributed to this obs erved effect, however (von Klot et al., 2005). Small associations of IHD admissions with incremental increases in NO 2 have been observed in Australian populati ons (Barnett et al., 2006; Jalaludi n et al., 2006; Simpson et al., 2005a). In a study with populations from seven ci ties in Australia, Barn ett et al., (2006) found that there was no association between NO 2 and IHD admissions for the age group 25 to 64 years. For persons 65 years and older an increase of 2.5% ([ 95% CI: 1.0, 4.1] lag 0 to 1) in IHD hospital admissions per 5.1-ppb increase in NO 2 was reported. A study of four Australian cities reported a 1-ppb change in the dail y maximum 1-h concentration of NO 2 was associated with a 0.17% change in hospitalization for IHD ([95% CI: 0.07, 0.27] lag 0) among the elderly. In a single-city study of Sydney, Jalaludin et al. ( 2006) reported a 2.11% ([95% CI: 0.34, 3.01] lag 0) change in the rate of hospitalization of patients 65 years and older per 9.3-ppb increase in daily maximum 1-h concentration of NO 2. A seasonal effect of NO 2 on hospitalization for IHD was observed (Jalaludin et al., 2006) . However, the effect of NO 2 was diminished when it was modeled with CO (Jalaludin et al., 2006). Wong et al. (1999) reported no associati on between IHD admissi ons and 24-h average NO 2 concentration in Hong Kong (Wong et al., 1999). A Korean study reported an 8% increase in hospitalization for IHD during all seasons (RR = 1.08 [95% CI: 1.036, 1.14] lag 5) per 14.6-ppb increase in 24-h concentration of NO 2 (Lee et al., 2003a). Th e relative risk increased dramatically for those $64 years of age in the summer months to 25% for the same incremental change (RR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.11, 1.41] lag 5). The effect of NO 2 remained robust in two-pollutant models with PM 10 (RR = 1.09 [95% CI: 1.02, 1.16] lag 5) but not with CO. Hospital Admissions for Myocardial Infarction (MI) (ICD9 410) Key studies of hospital admissions for MI are summarized in Figure 3.2-15. Positive associations of emergency admissions for MI and increases in ambient NO 2 level were reported in Boston (Zanobetti and Schwartz, 2006) and Southern California (Linn et al., 2000; Mann et al., 2002).

Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) (ICD9 428) Studies of hospital admissions and ED visits for CHF have produced mixed results (Figure 3.2-16). A seven city study conducted in the US among the elderly found positive associations in Los Angeles (RR: = 1.32 [ 1.21, 1.43]), Chicago (RR: = 1.37 = 1.14 [1.04, 1.28] ) per 20-ppb increase in NO 2 (Morris et al., 1995).

The result for NO 2 was not affected by PM 10 but was diminished in a two-pollutant model containing CO. A 6.9% (O R = 1.3 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.55], lag 0) increase in CHF admissions was observed in a seven city Australian study (pooled results) per 20-ppb increase in 24-h average NO 2 concentration among the elde rly (Barnett et al., 2006). Hospital Admissions for Stroke and Ce rebrovascular Disease (ICD9 430-448) Cerebrovascular diseases include ICD9 codes 430-448 and may be more narrowly defined to capture ischemic stroke (IS) (IC D9 433-435) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) (ICD9 430). Studies that have evaluated the associ ation between all cerebr ovascular disease and ambient NO 2 concentration are summarized in Figure 3.2-17. Results from these studies are inconsistent. The largest study described in the figure, conducted by Linn et al. (2000), did not find an effect for NO 2 on cerebrovascular disease admission (L inn et al., 2000). However, these authors report an increase in hospitalizations of 2.7% (95% CI : 2.6, 2.8) for occlusive stroke during the winter months (year round effect also observed). Wellenius et al. (2005) found a 2.94% increase in IS admissions per 11.93% increase in 24-h average NO 2 level (multipollutant models were not examined) (Wellenius et al., 2005). In a Canadian study, Villeneuve et al. (2006) reported an a ssociation between NO 2 exposure and IS during the winter months, among the elderly (OR = 1.26 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.46], lag 3). Results from Europe are also inconsistent with Ponka and Virtanen (1996) reporting null results and Ballester et al. (2001) reporting a 1.15 ([95% CI: 1.02, 1.29], lag 4) increase in cerebrovascular admissions per 20-ppb increase in 24-h NO 2 level. No association was found in Sydney between daily 1-h maximum NO 2 concentration and cerebrovascular disease (Jalaludin et al., 2006). No associations between air pollutants and stroke were reported in a multicity study conducted in Australia and New Zealand (Barnett et al., 2006). Investigations of NO 2 cerebrovascular disease and str oke have been conducted in populations in Asia (Chan et al., 2006; Tsai et al., 2003). An increas e in 24-h average concentration NO 2 of 20 ppb resulted in increased risk of hospitalization (OR = 1.67 [95% CI: 1.48, 1.87] lag 0 to 2) in Taiwan (Tsai et al., 2003). The associations were stronger on warm days. Using multipollutant models that were adjusted for PM 10, CO, O 3, and SO 2, Tsai et al.

Vaso-occlusion in Sickle Cell A recent study evaluated the association of pain in Sickle Cell patients, which is thought to be caused by vaso-occlusion, with air pollution (Yallop et al., 2007). A time series analysis was performed to link daily hospital admissions for acute pain among sickle cell patients with daily air pollution levels in London using the cross correlation function. No association was reported for NO 2. However, Yallop et al. obse rved an association (CCF = !0.063, lag 0) for NO, CO, and O 3.

Since results from multi pollutant models in single-city studies are generally less stable because of smaller sample sizes, results for multicity studies are discussed in this section. Burnett et al. (1997a) report robust estima tes for cardiac disease hospital admissions and NO 2, whereas the observed association for cardiac hospitalizations and PM were explained by gaseous pollutants. In anot her multicity study conducted in the same area, associations of NO 2 with cardiac disease were not attenuated when CO, SO 2, and PM variables were included in the models (Burnett et al., 1999). Relative risks for NO 2 with CHF were diminished in multipollutant models used in a multicity study including six U.S. cities (Morris et al., 1995). Wellenius et al. (2005a) did not report multipollutant results for a study of ischemic and HS. In this study, only ischemic stroke was associated with NO 2 exposure. Investigators conducting a multicity study in Au stralia observed a different effect with the NO 2 association, with CVD weakening after inclusion of CO in the model (Barnett et al., 2006). The authors hypothesized that NO 2 is a good surrogate for PM, which may explain the observed effect of NO 2 on admissions for CVD (Barnett et al., 2006). Results from another multicity study in Australia are similar with authors suggesting that NO 2 effects on cardiac disease and IHD may be confounded by PM (Simpson et al., 2005b). Multicity studies from Europe are inconsistent with regard to the resu lts of multipollutant models. Von Klot et al. reported that the effect of NO 2 on MI, angina, and cardiac di sease was independent of PM 10 and O3 (von Klot et al., 2005), while Ballester et al. (2006) reported that the effect of NO 2 on cardiac disease was diminished in two-pollutant models. Copollutant model results for NO 2 were not reported for a third multicity study in Europe (Lanki et al., 2006). Results from multipollutant models have been inconsistent in large multicenter studies that have evaluated the effect NO 2 on hospital and ED visits for CVD. In general, investigators acknowledge the limitations of multipollutant mode ls to tease out independent contributions of individual and highly correlated pollutants. In addition, most researchers generally acknowledge the possibility that observed effects on the cardiovasc ular system are related to traffic pollutants. See Table 3.2-3 for the effects of including a copollutant with NO 2 in multipollutant models. August 2007 3-72 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 3.2.2.2 Heart Rate Variability, Repolarizati on, Arrhythmia, and Other Measures Cardiovascular Function Asso ciated with Short-Term NO 2 Exposure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Heart Rate Variability HRV, a measure of the beat-to-beat change in heart rate (HR), is a reflection of the overall autonomic control of the heart. It is hyp othesized that increased air pollution levels may stimulate the autonomic nervous system and lead to an imbalance of cardiac autonomic control characterized by sympathetic act ivation unopposed by parasympathetic control (Liao et al., 2004; Brook et al., 2004). Such an imbalance of cardiac autonomic control may predispose susceptible people to greater risk of ventricular arrhythmias and consequent cardiac deaths (Liao et al., 2004; Brook et al., 2004). HRV has been studied most frequently in cor onary artery disease populations, particularly in th e post-MI population. Lower time domain as well as frequency domain variables (i.e., reduced HR V) are associated with an increase in cardiac and all-cause mortality among this susceptible population. T hose variables most closely correlated with parasympathetic tone appear to have the strongest predictive value in hear t disease populations. Specifically, acute changes in RR-variability tem porally precede and are predictive of increased long-term risk for the occurrence of ischemic sudden death and/or precipitating ventricular arrhythmias in individuals with established heart disease (for ex ample, see La Rovere et al., 2003). However, acute changes in HRV parameters do not necessarily occur immediately prior to sudden fatal ventricular arrhythmias (Waxman et al., 1994). HRV itsel f is not the causative agent, nor has it been implied to be a causative agent in any of the studies performed to date. Altered HRV, including changes in HRV associated with exposure to criter ia pollutants, may be a marker for enhanced risk. The potentially adverse effects of air po llutants on cardiac autonomic control were examined in a large population- based study, among the first in this field. Liao et al. (2004) investigated short-term associ ations between ambien t pollutants and cardiac autonomic control from the fourth cohort examination (1996 to 1998) of the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. PM 10, NO 2, and other gaseous air pollu tants were examined in this study. PM 10 (24-h average) and NO 2 exposures (24-h average) 1 day prior to the randomly allocated examination date were used. The mean (SD) NO 2 level was 21 (8) ppb. They calculated 5-min HRV indices between 8:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and used logarithmically- transformed data on high-frequency (0.15 to 0.40 Hz) and low-frequency (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) August 2007 3-73 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 power, standard deviation of normal R-R interval s (SDNN), and mean HR. The effective sample sizes for NO 2 and PM 10 were 4,390 and 4,899, respectively, from three U.S. study centers in North Carolina, Minnesota, and Mississippi. PM 10 concentrations measured 1 day prior to the HRV measurements were inversely associated with both frequency- and time-domain HRV indices. Ambient NO 2 concentrations were inversely asso ciated with high-frequency power and SDNN. In single-pollutant models, a 20-ppb increase in ambient NO 2 was associated with a 5% reduction (95% CI: 0.7, 9.2), in mean SDNN. Consistently more pronounced associations were suggested between PM 10 and HRV among persons with a history of hypertension. The Liao et al. (2004) findings were cross-sectionally deri ved from a population-based sample and reflect the short-term effects of air pollution on HRV. When the regression coefficients for each individual pollutant model were compared, the effects for PM 10 were considerably larger than the effects for gaseous pollutants such as NO 2. Because of the population-based sample, this study is more generaliz able than other smalle r panel studies. The findings are suggestive of short-term effects of air pollutants, including NO 2, on HRV at the population level. Various measures of HRV have been examined in relation to daily levels of ambient air pollution in other studies (Cha n et al., 2005; Wheeler et al ., 2006; et al., 2006; Schwar tz et al., 2005). Chan et al. (2005) recruited 83 patients from the cardiology section of a hospital in Taiwan. Patients in cluded 39 with coronary heart disease (CHD) and 44 with more than one risk factor for CHD. The authors reported finding significant associations between increases in NO 2 and decline in SDNN (NO 2 lagged 4 to 8 h) and LF (NO 2 lagged 5 or 7 h) (see Annex Table AX6.4.1 for quantitative results). There were no significant associations for r-MSSD or HF and NO 2. None of the other pollutants tested (PM 10, CO, SO 2, O3) were significantly associated with a ny of the HRV measured. Wheeler et al. (2006) examined HRV and ambient air pollution in Atlanta in 12 patients who had an MI from 3 to 12 months prior to enrollment and 18 COPD pa tients. The results in the two patient groups were quite different: incr easing concentration of NO 2 in the previous 4-h significantly reduced SDNN in MI patients and si gnificantly increased SDNN in COPD patients (see Annex Table AX6.10). Similar significant associations were seen with increases in 4-h ambient PM 2.5. The PM 2.5 concentrations were moderately correlated with NO 2 levels (r = 0.4). August 2007 3-74 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 In contrast, Holguin et al. (2003) PM 2.5 concentrations were m oderately correlated with NO 2 levels (v = 0.04) in 34 elderly adults in Me xico City and found no significant associations with increases in NO 2, but did find significant effects of PM 2.5 on HF, particularly among hypertensive subjects. Similarly, Luttmann-Gibson et al. (2006) also foun d significant effects of PM 2.5 and SO4 on HRV measured in a panel of 32 senior adults in Steubenville, OH, but observed no effect of increasing NO 2. Likewise, Schwartz et al. (2005) found significant effects of increases in PM 2.5 on measures of HRV, while no associations with NO 2 were observed. A population-based study of air pollutants and HRV was conducted in Boston, MA on 497 men from the VA Normative Aging Study (NAS) (P ark et al., 2005b). The mean (SD) 24-h average NO 2 concentration was 22.7 (6.2) ppb. Associat ions with HRV outcomes were observed with a 4-h moving average of O 3 and PM 2.5 concentrations, but not with NO 2. Repolarization Changes In addition to the role played by the au tonomic nervous system in arrhythmogenic conditions, myocardial vulnerability and repolarization abnormalities are believed to be key factors contributing to the mechanism of such di seases. Measures of repolarization include QT duration, T-wave complexity, variability of T- wave complexity, and T-wave amplitude. A prospective panel study, conducted in East Germ any, analyzed 12 repeat ECG recordings for 56 males with IHD (Henneberger et al., 2005). Ambient air po llutants measured at fixed monitoring sites were used to assign individual exposures for 0 to 5, 5 to 11, 12 to 17, 18 to 23, 0 to 23 h and for 2 to 5 days prior to the EEG. Pollutants considered were ultrafine particles (UFP), accumulation mode particle (ACP), PM 2.5, elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), SO 2, NO 2, NO, and CO. Associations were observe d between (1) QT duration and EC and OC; (2) T-wave amplitude and UFP, ACP and PM 2.5; and (3) T-wave complexity and PM 10, EC, and OC. NO (r = 0.83) and NO 2 (0.76) were highly correlated with UFP but were not associated with repolarization abnormalities. Arrhythmias Recorded on Implanted Defibrillators Implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are often used in cardiac patients to detect life-threatening arrhythmias. Among patients with ICDs in eastern Massachusetts, increases in ambient NO 2 was significantly associated with defibril lator discharges (Pet ers et al., 2000) and ventricular arrhythmias (Dockery et al., 2005; Rich et al., 2005), but not with paroxysmal atrial August 2007 3-75 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 fibrillation (PAF) episodes (Rich et al., 2006a). In a pilot study, Peters et al. (2000) abstracted device records for 3 years for each of 100 patients with ICDs. Defibrillator discharge events were positively associated with the previous day and 5-day mean NO 2 concentrations: each 20-ppb increase in the previous day's NO 2 level was associated with an increased risk of a discharge event (OR = 1.55 [95% CI: 1.05, 2.29]) (see Annex Table AX6.4.2 for the increase associated with a 20-ppb increase in NO 2). Two separate analyses of the same cohort of patients examined th e association between air pollution and the incidence of ventricular arrhyt hmias (Dockery et al., 2005; Rich et al., 2005). A total of 203 patients with ICDs who liv ed within 25 miles of the ambient monitoring site in Boston were monitored. Data include d a total of 635 person-years of follow-up or an average of 3.1 years per subject. The median (IQR) 48-h average NO 2 concentration was 22.7 (7.7) ppb. In the analysis by Dockery et al . (2005), positive associations were observed between ventricular arrhythmias within 3 days of a prior event and a 2-day mean of several air pollutants including PM 2.5, BC, NO 2, CO, and SO 2. Rich et al. (2005, 2006a) examined associations between ambient ai r pollution levels and two othe r cardiac endpoint s recorded by the ICDs, namely ventricular arrhythmias (Rich et al., 2005) and PAF episodes (Rich et al., 2006a). In single-pollutant models, each 20-ppb increase in the mean NO 2 level over the previous 2 days was associated with an increa sed likelihood of ventricular arrhythmia, OR = 1.54 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.18). The association with NO 2 was not significant in two pollutant models with PM 2.5, but remained marginally si gnificant in models with O 3 (2.0-ppb increase in 24-h moving average NO 2 was associated with an OR = 1.36 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.80]). There was a strong association between an increase of NO 2 (by 20 ppb) and ventricular arrhythmia in the presence of ventricular arrhythmia within th e previous 72 h (OR = 2.09 [95% CI: 1.26, 3.51]). No association was found between NO 2 levels and PAF (Rich et al., 2006b). Plasma Fibrinogen, Biomarker for Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiological Studies In a large cross-sectional study of 7,205 offi ce workers in London, Pekkanen et al. (2000) collected blood samples and analyzed the associa tion between plasma fibr inogen, a risk factor for CVD, and ambient levels of air pollution.

The correlation between daily NO 2 and other traffic-related pollutants were high: daily levels of black smoke (r = 0.75), PM 10 (r = 0.76), SO 2 (r = 0.62), CO (r = 0.81). The authors suggest that the increas ed concentrations of fibrinoge n, a mediator of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, may be an indicator of inflammatory reactions caused by air pollution. Pekkanen et al. (2002) enrolled a panel of 45 adults with coro nary heart disease in order to examine associations between heart function as measured by risk of ST-segment depression and particulate pollution. Level of part iculate and gaseous po llutants, including NO 2, lagged by 2 days was found to have the strongest effect on risk of ST-segment depression during mild exercise tests (OR = 14.1 [95% CI: 3.0, 65.4] for ST-segment depression of >0.1mV with a 20-ppb increase in NO 2 lagged by 2 days). A large (n = 863) cross-sectiona l study of resting heart rate (HR) of adults in France found significant associations between elevated levels of NO 2 within 8-h of measurement and resting HR of $75 beats per minute (bpm) (OR = 2.7 [95% CI: 1.2, 5.4] for resting HR >75 bpm for each 20-ppb increase in NO 2) (Ruidivets et al., 2005). Controlled Human Exposure and Animal Studies Folinsbee et al. (1978) studied three groups of 5 healthy males exposed to 0.62-ppm NO 2 for 2 h. The groups differed by duration of exer cise during exposure: 15, 30, or 60 min. In addition to pulmonary function, outcome measures included indirect calorimetry, cardiac output using the CO 2 rebreathing technique, blood pressure, HR, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). There were no significan t effects for the individual groups, or for the 15 subjects analyzed together. However, th e small number of subjects in each group limited statistical power. Drechsler-Parks (1995) assesse d changes in cardiac output using noninvasive impedance cardiography. Eight older adults (56 to 85 years of age) were exposed to 0.60-ppm NO 2, 0.45-ppm O 3, and the combination of 0.60-ppm NO 2 + 0.45-ppm O 3 for 2-h with intermittent exercise. The exercise-induced increase in cardiac output was smaller with the NO 2 + O 3 exposures than with the filtered air or O 3 exposures alone. There we re no significant differences in minute ventilation, HR, or cardiac stroke volume, although the mean st roke volume was lower for NO 2 + O 3 than for air. The author speculated that chemical interactions between O 3 and NO 2 August 2007 3-77 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 at the level of the epithe lial lining fluid led to th e production of nitrite, leading to vasodilatation, with reduced cardiac preload and cardiac output . This study has not been repeated. One previous study (Linn et al., 1985a) repo rted small but statistically significant reductions in blood pressure after exposure to 4-ppm NO 2 for 75 min, a finding consistent with systemic vasodilatation in response to the expos ure. However, many subsequent studies at concentrations generally less than 4 ppm have not reported cha nges in blood pressure in response to NO 2 exposure. There is also evidence that NO 2 exposure may affect circula ting red blood cells. Posin et al. (1978) exposed 10 healt hy males to 1- or 2-ppm NO 2 for 2.5 to 3.0-h daily for 2 days. Blood obtained immediately after the second exposure showed a reduced hemoglobin and hematocrit (NO 2: 41.96 \u00b1 2.75; sham exposure: 43.18 \u00b1 and reduced red blood cell acetyl cholinesterase levels. However, the control air exposures were not identical to and concurrent with the NO 2 exposures, a potential fl aw in the study design. In the study by Frampton et al. (2002), healt hy subjects were exposed to air or 0.6- or 1.5-ppm NO 2 for 3-h with intermittent exercise, a nd blood was obtained 3.5-h after exposure. There was a significant, concentration-related reduction in hematocrit and hemoglobin in both males and females, confirming the findings of Posin et al. (1978). These studies suggest that NO 2 exposure in the range of 1- to 2-ppm for a few hours is sufficient to alter the red blood cell membrane. The reductions in blood hemoglobin were not sufficiently large to result in health effects for these healthy subjects. However, in the Frampton study, the reduction in hemoglobin represented the equivalent of about 200 mL of blood loss for a 70-kg male. This could conceivably have adverse cardiova scular consequences for someone with significant underlying lung disease, heart disease, or anemia. These few studies suggest systemic effects of NO 2 exposure at concentrations below 2.0 ppm, but the observations require confir mation. The results on the effect of NO 2 on various hematological parameters in animals are inc onsistent and thus, provi de little biological plausibility for the epidemiology findings. Ther e have also been reported changes in the red blood cell membranes of experimental animals following NO 2 exposure. Red blood cell D-2,3-diphosphoglycerate was reportedly increas ed in guinea pigs following exposure to 0.36-ppm NO 2 for 1 week (Mersch et al., 1973). An increase in red blood cell sialic acid, indicative of a younger population of red blood cells, was reported in rats exposed to 4.0-ppm August 2007 3-78 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 NO 2 continuously for 1 to 10 days (Kunimoto et al., 1984). However, in another study, exposure to the same concentration of NO 2 resulted in a decrease in red bl ood cells (Mochitate and Miura, 1984). A more recent study (Takano et al., 2004) using an obese rat st rain found changes in blood triglycerides, high-d ensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL ), and HDL/total cholesterol ratios with a 24-week exposure to 0.16-ppm NO 2. In the only study conducted below 5-ppm NO 2 that evaluated methemoglobin formation, Nakajima and Kusumoto (1968) reported that, in mice exposed to 0.8-ppm NO 2 for 5 days, the amount of methemoglobin was not increased. This is in contrast to some (but not all) in vitro and high concentrations of NO 2 in vivo studies, which have found methemoglobin effects (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993). 3.2.2.3 Integration for Effects of Short-Term NO 2 Exposure on Cardiovascular Outcomes Cardiac rhythm disorders are the leading cau se of hospital admissions for CVD in the United States (Henneberger et al., 2005). Results from a Boston area study of ventricular arrhythmias indicate an association of arrhythm ia with short-term exposure to ambient (Peters et al., 2000; Dockery et al., 2005; Rich et al., 2005; see also A nnex Table AX2.6.4-1). However, arrhythmias were also associ ated with PM exposure and high correlations among ambient pollutants were reported. A study of repolarization changes and air pollution also points to PM as a possible causative agent (He nneberger et al., 2005). Results from studies of HRV are also inconclusive with regard to the effect of NO 2 on the cardiovascular sy stem (Liao et al., 2004; Chan et al., 2005; Wheeler et al., 2006; Hol guin et al., 2003; Luttma nn-Gibson et al., 2006; Schwartz et al., 2005). Numerous studies have shown an association between NO 2 exposure and hospital or ED admissions for CVD including IHD, MI, CFH, car diac disease not involving the peripheral circulation, and cerebrovascular disease. Both incremental changes in daily 1-h maximum concentrations and 24-h averages of NO 2 are associated with IHD admissions worldwide. Associations between hospital admissions for MI and ambient NO 2 are reported in both the United States and Europe. Associations between ambient NO 2 and CHF were found in several U.S. cities and in an Australian multicity meta-analysis. Studies of ambient NO 2 and other cardiac disease or cerebrovascular disease are fewer and provide less consistent results. However, evidence from multipollutant models is inconsistent and does not suggest that the effects of NO 2 are robust when adjusted for ot her traffic-related pollutants.

Typically, the studies util ize short exposure durations and small numbers of subjects, resulting in poor characterization of NO 2 concentration-response and, thus, are of limited value in providing corroborating evidence for the epidemiological findings. Early work (Folinsbee et al., 1978) using exposures of 0.62 ppm for 2-h found no changes in HR and cardiac output in healthy males. Another early study (Linn et al., 1985a) demonstrated reductions in blood pressure (BP) following an exposure of 4-ppm NO 2 for 75 min. A more recent study (Gong et al., 2005) demonstrated re ductions in diastolic BP following a 2-h exposure to 0.4-ppm NO 2. Another cardiovascular endpoint affected by NO 2 is circulating red blood cells. Posin et al. (1978) found reduced hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC acetylcholinesterase levels following exposures to 1- or 2-ppm NO 2 for 2.5 to 3-h daily for 2 days. This was confirmed in a study (Frampton et al., 2002) exposing healthy subjects to 0.6 and 1.5 ppm for 3-h with intermittent exercise. Thes e alterations in hemoglobin and hematocrit do not pose a risk to healthy individuals, but could account for the obs erved cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in individuals with underlying IHD, CHF, and other heart and lung disease. There are limited experimental da ta on the effects of ambient NO 2 on the heart. Two early studies (Suzuki et al., 1981, 1984) showed reductions in PaO 2 at 4 ppm for 3 months and reduced HR at 1.2 and 4 ppm for 1 month. Data on the effects of NO 2 on hematological endpoints are inconsisten t; however, two early studies (Mersc h et al., 1973; Kunimoto et al., 1984) found changes in RBC membranes and sialic acid. A more recent study (Takano et al., 2004) using an obese rat strain found changes in blood triglycerides, HDL, and HDL/total cholesterol ratios with a 24- week exposure to 0.16-ppm NO 2. These studies may provide limited biological plausibility and mechanistic evidence for an effect on the cardiovascular system. 3.3 MORTALITY WITH SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE TO NO 2 Since the 1993 AQCD, a number of studies, mostly using time-series analyses, reported short-term mortality risk estimates for NO x, in most cases, (see Annex Table AX6.7). There was no epidemiological study reviewed in the 1993 AQCD that examined the mortality effects of ambient NO x. However, since most of these studies' original focus or hypothesis was on PM, a quantitative interpretation of the NO x mortality risk estimates requires caution.

Risk estimates from multicity studies are also usually reported for consistent lag days, further reducing potential bias caused by choosing the \"best\" lag in individual studies. There have been several multicity studies from the United States, Canada, and Europe. Meta-analysis stud ies also provide useful information on describing heterogeneity of risk estimates across studies, but unlike multicity studies, the heterogeneity of risk estimates seen in meta-analysis may also reflect the varia tion in analytical approaches across studies. Multicity studies and meta-analyses are reviewed in the following section, and effect estimates from these studies are summarized. Discussion will focus on the studies that were not affected by GAM with convergence issues (Dominici et al., 2002; Ramsay et al., 2003) unless otherwise noted when the studies raise relevant issues. 3.3.1.1 United States Largest 90 Cities Study The time-series analysis of the largest 90 U. S. cities (Samet et al., 2000; reanalysis Dominici et al., 2003) in the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) is by far the largest multicity study conducted to da te to investigate the mortality effects of air pollution, but its primary interest was PM (i.e., PM 10). It should also be noted that, according to the table of mean pollution levels in th e original report (Sam et et al., 2000), NO 2 was not measured in 32 of the 90 cities. The analysis in the original report used GAMs with default convergence criteria and Dominici et al. (2003) reanalyzed the data using GAM with stringent convergence criteria as well as using GLM. It s hould be noted that this model's adjustment for weather effects employs more terms than other ti me-series studies in the literature, suggesting that the model adjusts for poten tial confounders more aggressively than the models in other studies. PM 10 and O 3 (in summer) appeared to be more str ongly associated with mortality than the other gaseous pollutants. Regarding NO 2, SO 2, and CO, the authors stated, \"The results did not indicate associations of thes e pollutants with total mortality.\" However, it should be noted that, as with PM 10, NO 2, SO 2, and CO, each showed the strongest association at lag 1 day (for O3, it was lag 0 day), and as with PM 10, addition of other copollutants in the model at lag 1 day hardly affected the mortality risk estimates of these gaseous pollutants.

(2003). total mortality risk estimates for NO 2 from Dominici et al. (2003). The NO 2 risk estimates in the multipollutant models were about th e same or larger. Thus, these results do not indicate that the NO 2-mortality association was confounded by PM 10 or other pollutants (and vice versa). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3.3.1.2 Canadian Multicity Studies There have been four Canadian multicity studies: (1) analysis of gaseous pollutants in 11 cities from 1980 to 1991 (Burnett et al., 1998); (2) analysis of PM 2.5, PM 10-2.5, and gaseous pollutants in 8 cities from 1986 to 1996 (B urnett et al., 2000); (3) analysis of PM 2.5, PM 10-2.5, and gaseous pollutants in 12 cities from 1981 to 1999 (Burnett et al ., 2004); and, (4) analysis of NO 2, NO, PM 2.5 and its selected components, PM 10-2.5, PM 10, as well as an examination of correlation August 2007 3-82 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 between these pollutants and selected traffic- related species including VOCs and PAHs with between 1984 and 2000 (Brook et al., 2007). Since the first two studies were affected by the GAM issue (only the PM indices were reanalyzed for the second study in Burnett and Goldberg, 2003), and the third study is most extensive both in terms of the length and coverage of cities, the discussion will focus on the third study. Total (nonaccidental), cardi ovascular, and respiratory mort ality were analyzed in the Burnett et al. (2004) study. Daily 24-h average as well as 1-h max values were analyzed for all the gaseous pollutants and CoH. For PM 2.5, PM 10-2.5, PM 10, CoH, SO 2, and CO, the strongest mortality association was found at lag 1, whereas for NO 2, it was the 3-day moving average (i.e., average of 0-, 1-, and 2-day lags), and for O 3, it was the 2-day moving average. Of the single- day lag estimates for NO 2, lag 1-day showed the strongest associations, which is consistent with the NMMAPS result. The 24-h average values showed stronger associations than the 1-h max values for all the gase ous pollutants and CoH except for O 3. The pooled NO 2 mortality risk estimate in a single-pollutant mode l (for all available da ys) was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.1, 2.9) per 20-ppb increase in th e 3-day moving average of NO 2. NO 2 was most strongly correlated with CoH (r = 0.60), followed by PM 2.5 (r = 0.48). However, the NO 2-mortality association was insensitive to adjustment for thes e or any of other polluta nts in the two-pollutant models. For example, the NO 2 mortality risk estimate with CoH in the model was 2.6% (95% CI: 1.3, 3.9) per 20-ppb increase in the 3-day moving average of NO 2. The model with O 3 resulted in the largest reduction in the NO 2 risk estimate, 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9, 2.7). For the data subset for days when PM 2.5 data were available (every 6th day), the NO 2 risk estimate was 2.4% (95% CI: 0.7, 4.1) and 3.1% (95% CI: 1.2, 5.1) per 20-ppb increase in 1-day lag NO 2, without and with PM 2.5 in the model, respectively. The risk es timates for cardiovascular (2.0% [95% 20-ppb increase in the 3-day moving average) were similar to that for total mort ality. In their sensitivity analysis, larger risk estimates were observed for warmer months. Older age groups also showed larger risk estimates. The results from the above 12-city study appear to be similar to those from the 8-city study (Burnett et al., 2000) in that NO 2-mortality associations were stronger than those for the associations between the size-fr actionated PM indices and mortal ity, and simultaneous inclusion of NO 2 and the size-fractionated PM indices in the regre ssion model resulted in reductions in the August 2007 3-83 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 PM risk estimates. However, Burnett et al. ( 2004) mentioned, in their discussion section, results from additional data collection and analysis in which daily PM 2.5 was collected in 11 of the 12 cities between 1998 and 2000. In that an alysis, simultaneous inclusion of the PM 2.5 and NO 2 in the model resulted in a c onsiderable reduction of the NO 2 risk estimates. Thus, while the NO 2 risk estimates were not sensitive to adjustment for the PM indices collected every-6th-day, it was sensitive to adjustment for the daily PM 2.5. Burnett et al. (2004) discussed that reducing combustion would result in public health benefits because NO 2 or its products originate from combustion sources but cautioned th at they could not implicate NO 2 as a specific causal pollutant. Brook et al. (2007) further examined data from ten Canadian cities with a special focus on the NO 2 and the role of other traffic- related air pollutants. Again, NO 2 showed the strongest associations with mortality among the pollutant s examined including NO, and none of the other pollutants substantially reduced NO 2 risk estimates in multi-pollutant models. The analysis also confirmed the 2004 Burnett et al. study result that NO 2 risk estimate was larger in the warm season. Generally, NO showed stronger correl ation with the primary VOCs (e.g., benzene, toluene, xylenes, etc.) than NO 2 or PM 2.5. NO 2 was more strongly correl ated with the organic compounds than it is with the PM mass indices or trace metals in PM 2.5. Brook et al. concluded that the strong NO 2 effects seen in Canadian ci ties could be a result of it being the best indicator, among the pollutants monitored, of fresh combustion as well as photochemically processed urban air. In summarizing the Canadian multicity studies, NO 2 was most consistently associated with mortality among the air pollu tants examined, especially in warm season. Adjustments for PM indices and its components did not reduce NO 2 risk estimates. NO 2 was also shown to be associated with organic compounds that are indicative of combustion products (traffic-related air pollution) and photochemical reactions 3.3.1.3 Air Pollution and Health: A Eu ropean Approach (APHEA) Studies The first report (Touloumi et al., 1997) on NO 2 and O 3 effects on mortality from the Air Pollution and Health: a European Approach (A PHEA1) project include d six cities (Athens, Barcelona, Paris, Lyon, Koln, and London). The data were analyzed by each center separately following a standardized methodolog y, but the lag for the \"best\" model was allowed to vary in these cities from 0 to 3 days. A 30-ppb increase in 1-h max NO 2 was associated with a 1.5% August 2007 3-84 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.0) increased risk in nonaccident al mortality. There was a tendency for larger effects of NO 2 in cities with higher levels of black smoke. The pooled estimate for NO 2 was almost halved when black smoke was included in the model. The author suggested that the NO 2 effects on mortality could have been confounded by other \"vehicle-derived pollutants.\" Zmirou et al. (1998) analyzed (broad) cau se-specific mortality (cardiovascu lar and respiratory causes) in ten European cities including the four citie s (Barcelona, Paris, Lyon, and London) for which NO 2 was available, but th ey reported that \"NO 2 did not show consistent relationships\" with these mortality categories. One of the extended APHEA2 project studies (Katsouyanni et al., 2001 ; reanalysis, 2003) analyzed data from 29 European cities and reported risk estimates for PM 10 and not for NO 2, but found that the cities with higher NO 2 levels tended to have larger PM 10 risk estimates. Furthermore, simultaneous inclusion of PM 10 and NO 2 reduced the PM 10 risk estimate by half. An analysis of the elderly mortality in the same 28 cities (Aga et al., 2003) also found a similar effect modification of PM by NO 2. Thus, combined with the Touloumi et al. study result described above, PM and NO 2 risk estimates in these European cities may be reflecting the health effects of the same air pollution source and/or effect modifiers of each other. Samoli et al. (2005) investigated the concentration-response relationship between NO 2 and total nonaccidental mortality in nine of the APHEA2 cities where medians were >110 \u00b5g/m3 (57 ppb) third qu \u00b5g/m3 (68 ppb). Two methods, the nonparametric meta-smooth method and the parametric cubic spline method, were applied to estimate the shape of the concentration-response relationship. Bo th methods suggested a monotonic increase in the relationship, and the investigator s concluded that the linear mode l was adequate to describe the NO 2-mortality relationship. In another APHEA2 study, Samoli et al. (2006) analyzed 29 APHEA2 cities to estimate NO 2 associations for total, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths. Unlike the APHEA1 method, the average of lags 0 and 1 days were chosen a pr iori to avoid potential bias with the \"best\" lag approach. In addition, to estimate multiday effect s, a cubic polynomial distributed lag with lags up to 5 days before deaths was us ed. The figure for the total mortal ity risk estimates in the fitted distributed lag model is shown in Figure 3.3-2, wh ich suggests multiday effects. The strongest association shown at lag 1 day is also consistent with the re sults from NMMAPS and Canadian multicity studies. The estimated increase in tota l deaths was 1.7% (95% CI: 1.3, 2.2) per 30-ppb August 2007 3-85 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Figure 3.3-2.

The estimates using the distributed lag models were hi gher than those for the average of 0- and 1-day lags by 23%, 22%, and 45% for total, cardiovascu lar, and respiratory mortality, respectively. However, such a pattern was not consistently clear on the city-to-city basis (in 17 out of 29 cities, this was the case). Samoli et al. presented the shape of the association of total and respiratory mortality (they mentioned that the sh ape for the cardiovascular mortality was similar to that for total mortality) usi ng the cubic polynomial di stributed lag model. In the two-pollutant models with black smoke, PM 10, SO 2, and O 3, the risk estimates for total and cardiovascular mortality were not affected. The largest reduction in the NO 2 risk estimate for total mortality August 2007 3-86 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 was for the model with SO 2, reducing the estimate to 1.5% (95% CI: 1.0, 2.0). For respiratory mortality, only the risk estimate with SO 2 was substantially reduced (by ~50%). In a second- stage analysis, the city-specific effect estimate s were regressed on potential effect modifiers by weighted regression, with weights inversely proportional to their city-specific variances. For total and cardiovascular mortal ity, the geographical area (defin ed as western, southern, and central eastern European cities) was the most impo rtant effect modifier (estimates were lower in eastern cities), followed by the smoking prevalence (NO 2 risk estimates were higher in cities with a lower prevalence of smoking). For cardiovas cular mortality, the cities with higher natural gas consumption had higher NO 2 risk estimates. The authors concluded that the results showed effects of NO 2 on mortality, but that the role of NO 2 as a surrogate of other unmeasured pollutants could not be completely ruled out. In summarizing the series of APHEA studies, the NO 2 risk estimates were somewhat sensitive to the inclusion of PM in the model in the APHEA1 (six cities), but not in the analysis of a larger set in the APHEA2 (29 cities). The f act that PM risk estimates tend to be higher in the cities with higher NO 2, and vice-versa, appears to suggest that the mort ality risk estimates for NO 2 and PM share the same source type(s) in these European citi es. An examination of the concentration-response function in nine cities suggested no evidence of threshold. Multiday lagged effects were suggested. 3.3.1.4 The Netherlands Study While the Netherlands studies for the 1986 to 1994 data (Hoek et al. 2000 and 2001; reanalysis in Hoek, 2003) are not multicity studies and the Netherlands data were also analyzed as part of APHEA2 (Samoli et al., 2006), th e results from the reanalysis (Hoek, 2003) are discussed here, because the database comes from a large population (14.8 million for the entire country) and a more extensive analysis was conducted than in the multicity studies. PM 10, black smoke, O 3, NO 2, SO 2, CO, sulfate (SO 42!), and nitrate (NO 3!) were analyzed at lags 0, 1, and 2 days and the average of lags 0-6 days. PM 10, SO 42!, and NO 3! had less than 1/3 of the available days for other pollutant s. All the pollutants were associated with total mortality, and for single-day models, lag 1 day showed strongest associations for all the pollutants. The NO 2 risk estimate in a single-pollutant model was 1.9% (95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) per 20-ppb increase in 24-h average NO 2, and 1.5% (95% CI: 0.7, 2.4) per 20-ppb increase in the average of August 2007 3-87 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 0-6 day 24-h average NO 2. NO 2 was most highly correlated with black smoke (r = 0.87), and the simultaneous inclusion of NO 2 and black smoke reduced both pollutants' risk estimates (NO 2 risk estimate = 0.8% [95% CI: !0.5, 2.1] per 20-ppb increase in the average of 0-6 day NO 2). PM 10 was less correlated with NO 2 (r = 0.62), and the simultaneous inclusion of these pollutants resulted in an increase in the NO 2 risk estimate. Cause-specific analysis showed larger risk estimates for COPD (6.1% [95% CI: 2.7, 9.7] per 20-ppb increase in the average of 0-6 day daily average NO 2) and pneumonia (11.5% [95% CI: 6.7, 16.5]) deaths, but because essentially all of the pollutants showed larger risk estimates for these subcategories, it is difficult to interpret these estimates as effects of NO 2 alone. Likewise, the analysis of more specific cardiovascular mortality categories (Hoek et al., 2001; reanalysis in Ho ek, 2003) showed larger NO 2 risk estimates than that for the overall cardiovascular mortality, but again, since the same pattern was seen for other pollutants as well, it is difficult to interpret these cause-specific risk estimates as due to NO 2 alone. 3.3.1.5 Other European Multicity Studies There are also other European multicity studies , conducted in eight Italian cities (Biggeri et al., 2005), nine French cities (Le Tertre et al., 2002) and seven Spanis h cities (Saez et al., 2002). The studies by Le Tertre et al. (2002) and Saez et al. (2002) we re conducted using GAM methods with the default convergence setting. Biggeri et al. (2005) analyzed eight Italia n cities (Turin, Mila n, Verona, Ravenna, Bologna, Florence, Rome, and Palermo) from 19 90 to 1999. Only single-pollutant models were examined in this study. The NO 2 risk estimates were 3.6% (95% CI: 2.3, (95% CI: 0.2, 11.2) per 20-ppb increase in the average of 0- and 1-day lag 24-h average NO 2, for total, cardiovascular, and respirat ory deaths, respectively. Since all the pollutants showed positive associations with th ese mortality categories, and the correlation among the pollutants were not presented, it is no t clear how much of the observed associations are shared or confounded. The mortality risk estimates were not heterogeneous across cities for all the gaseous pollutants. The French nine cities study examined black smoke, SO 2, NO 2, and O 3 by generally following the APHEA protocol but using GAM and the average of lags 0 and 1 day for combined estimates. All four pollutants were positively associated with mortality outcomes, August 2007 3-88 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE with a 50-\u00b5g/m3 (26 ppb) increase in pollutants being asso ciated with an increase of 2.7 to 3.8% in total mortality. The study did not report desc ription of correlation among the pollutants or conduct multipollutant models; th erefore, it is difficult to as sess the potential extent of confounding among these pollutants. The NO 2 risk estimates were reported to be homogeneous across cities. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 The Spanish Multi-center Study on Air Polluti on and Mortality (whose Spanish acronym is EMECAM) published a study with a focus on PM indices (PM 10, TSP, and black smoke) and SO 2 in 12 cities (Ballester et al., 200 2) and a study that focused on O 3 and NO 2 in seven cities (Saez et al., 2002). These studies followed the APHEA protocol but using the GAM approach. The Ballester et al. study did not consider NO 2, and, while the Saez et al. study did consider SO 2 and CO in the multipollutant model, they did not consider PM indices. Thus, the extent of correlation between NO 2 and PM indices, or the extent of possible confounding between these pollutants is not known. The Saez et al. (2002) study reported that NO 2 was positively associated with total and cardiovascular mortality in the model with all the gaseous pollutants included simultaneously. The NO 2 risk estimates were reported to be heterogeneous across the cities. 3.3.1.6 Australian Four Cities Study Simpson et al. (2005b) analyzed data from four Australian cities (Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney) using methods similar to th e APHEA2 approach. They also examined sensitivity of results to three statistical mode ls: (1) GAM with a single nonparametric smoother (to adjust for temporal trends) and parametric sm oothers to adjust for ot her covariates and using stringent convergence criteria as implemented in the statistical package, Splus; (2) GLM with natural splines; and (3) GAM with a penalized spline algorithm in conjunction with multiple smoothing parameter estimation by generalized cr oss-validation, which avoids the back-fitting issues, as implemented in the statistical packag e, R. Associations between mortality and NO 2, O3, and nephelometer readings were examined at single day lag 0, 1, 2, and 3 days and using the average of 0- and 1-day lags. Among the thr ee pollutants, correlati on was strongest between NO 2 and nephelometer readings, ranging from (r ~ up to 0.62 among the four cities). Of the three pollutants, NO 2 showed the largest mortality risk es timates per inter-quartile-range. The authors state that the results us ing the three statistical methods \"yield similar results,\" although the figure of the results for the three methods appear to show some 20% difference in risk August 2007 3-89 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 estimates between the smallest (the GLM appro ach) and the largest (the GAM with R). The authors presented numerical results from the GAM/Splus approach. The estimated risk for 30-ppb increase in 1-h maximum increase of the average of 0- and 1-day lag NO 2 was 3.4% (95% CI: 3.5, 19.9) for total, cardiovascular, and respirator y deaths, respectively. The NO 2 risk estimates were not sensitive to the addition of nephelometer readi ngs (3.1% 6.2]) in the two-pollutant models for total mort ality, but the nephelometer risk estimate was greatly reduced in the model with NO 2. Multipollutant Modeling Results The results from multipollutant models in the multicity studies (i.e., NMMAPS, Canadian 12 cities, APHEA2, and Australian 4 cities studies) suggest that NO 2 mortality risk estimates were generally not sensitive to th e inclusion of copollutant(s) (mostly PM indices) in the models. The Netherlands study (Hoek et al., 2003), with a large population databa se, showed a reduction in NO 2 mortality risk estimates when black smoke wa s included in the model. Examining this issue in single-city studies is more difficult because of generally wider confidence intervals owing to smaller sample size. Also, many of th e available single-city studies that presented multipollutant model results were those that used GAM analyses with default convergence criteria. Furthermore, because a large majority of these single-city studies focused on PM (and less frequently, O 3), very few studies examined multipollutant models with NO 2 and other gaseous pollutants and the combinations of copo llutants examined were not usually consistent across studies. Thus, a systematic evaluation of the multipollutant results from single-city studies is limited, and we only br iefly summarize these results qualitatively, with focus on larger cities below. The single-city analyses that examined NO 2 and PM indices toge ther and did not find major reductions (i.e., more than 50% re duction in excess risk estimates) in NO 2 risk estimates include analyses of data from Cook County, IL, with PM 10 (Moolgavkar, 2003; GAM analysis); Los Angeles, CA, with 2003; GAM analysis ); Maricopa County, AZ, with PM 10 (Moolgavkar, 2000; GAM analysis ); and, Vancouver, Canada, with PM 10 (Vedal et al., 2003). The single-city st udies that analyzed NO 2 and PM indices together and did find major reductions in NO 2 risk estimates include analyses of data from Philadelphia, PA, with TSP August 2007 3-90 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE (Kelsall et al., 1997; GAM analysis ); Santa Clara County, CA, with PM 2.5 and NO 3! (Fairley, 1999 with GAM; reanalysis, 2003) ; Mexico City with PM 2.5 (Borja-Aburto et al., 1998); Sydney, Australia, with bsp (Morgan et al., 1998). Thus, it is difficult to find a consistent pattern of evidence of confounding with PM from these single -city results. It is also possible that the constituents of PM (e.g., relative contribution of traffic-related po llution to PM mass) vary from city to city and hence co rrelations of PM with NO 2 vary, contributing to a pparently inconsistent results. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 A fewer single-city studies examined multipollutant models with NO 2 and other gaseous pollutants. Those that examined NO 2 and O 3 simultaneously and did not find major reductions in NO 2 risk estimates include analyses of data from Los Angeles, CA (Kinney and \u00d6zkaynak, 1991); Philadelphia, PA (Kelsall et al., 1997; GAM PA (Lipfert et al., 2000b); London, England (Bremner et al., 1999 ). The studies in which adding O 3 did reduce NO 2 risk estimates include analyses of data from Barcelona, Spain (Saez et al., 2002, asthma mortality); and Sydney, Australia (Morgan et al., 1998). In Toront o data (Burnett et al., 1998), including both CO and NO 2 reduced the NO 2 risk estimate; however, in the Canadian 12-cities study, the combined NO 2 risk estimate was not sensitive to inclusions of CO. In the analyses of data from Philadelphia, PA (Kelsall et al., 1997 ; GAM analysis); Vancouver, Canada (Vedal et al., 2003); and London, England (Bremner et al., 1999), two-pollutant models with SO 2 did not reduce NO 2 risk estimates, whereas in the analys es of Seoul, Korea (Kwon et al., 2001) and Hong Kong, China (Wong et al., 2001), adding SO 2 in the model did reduce NO 2 risk estimates. Again, the results from these single-city studies are too limited to allow a consistent pattern to emerge. In summary, because of the lack of consistency in the way multipollutants were examined (e.g., lags examined, combination of pollutants examined, model specification) and because of the limited statistical power in individual cities, it is difficult to extract information that help elucidate a pattern of confounding between NO 2 and other pollutants from these single-city studies. Therefore, the multipollutant results from multicity studies provide more useful information on this issue. As noted before, the results from the multicity studies from the United States, Canada, and Europe generally suggest that NO 2 mortality risk estimates are not very sensitive to the addition of copollutants. Howeve r, this does not resolve the issue of surrogacy August 2007 3-91 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 and its interpretation is also co mplicated by the possible influence of varying extent of exposure characterization error across multiple pollutants. 3.3.1.7 Meta-analyses of NO 2 Mortality Studies Stieb et al. (2002) reviewed time-series mortality studies published between 1985 and 2000, and conducted meta-analysis to estima te combined effects for each of PM 10, CO, NO 2, O3, and SO 2. Since many of the studies reviewed in that analysis were affected by the GAM convergence issue, Stieb et al . (2003) updated the estimates by separating the GAM versus non- GAM studies and by single- versus multipollutant models. There were more GAM estimates than non-GAM estimates for all the pollutants except SO 2. For NO 2, there were 11 estimates from single-pollutant models and only 3 estimat es from multipollutant models. The lags and multiday averaging used in these estimates varied. The combined estimate for total mortality was 0.8% (95% CI: 0.2, 1.5) per 20-ppb increase in the daily average NO 2 from the single- pollutant models, and 0.4% (95% CI: !0.2, 1.1). Note that, although the estimate from the multipollutant models was smaller than that from the single-pollutant mo dels, the number of the studies for the multipollutant models was small (thr ee), also, the data extraction procedure of this meta-analysis for the multipollutant models wa s to extract from each study the multipollutant model that resulted in the grea test reduction in risk estimate co mpared with that observed in single-pollutant models. It shoul d also be noted that all the mu lticity studies whose combined estimates have been discussed above were published after this meta-analysis. 3.3.1.8 Summary of Risk Estimates for Mortality from Short-Term NO 2 Exposure Studies Figure 3.3-3 shows combined estimates for total mortality per the standardized increments (20 ppb for 24-h average or 30 ppb for daily 1-h maximum) from the multicity studies and meta-analysis discus sed above. The estimates from single-pollutant models range from 0.5 (the NMMAPS study) to 3.6 (the Italian 8 cities study) percent. The heterogeneity of estimates in these studies may be due to several factors including the diffe rences in: (1) model specification, (2) averaging/lag time, (3) NO 2 levels, and (4) effect modifying factors. Interestingly, the Canadian 12-city study showed co mbined risk estimates (average of 0-1 day or single 1-day lag) about 4 times larger than that for the U.S. estimate, despite the fact that the range of Canadian NO 2 (10 to 26 ppb) was somewhat lower than that for the U.S. data (9 to August 2007 3-92 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Figure 3.3-3.

In fact, th e NMMAPS estimate is the smallest among the multicities studies. Since a similar pattern (i.e., the NMMAPS estimate being the smallest August 2007 3-93 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 among multicities study) was seen for PM 10 mortality risk estimates (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004), it is possible that th is may be due to the difference in model specifications. The NMMAPS study used more smoothing terms (two terms for temperature [same-day and average of lag 1 to 3] and two te rms for dewpoint [same-day and average of lag 1 to 3]) and more degrees of freedom for the smoo thing terms (up to 6) than other studies, which usually include up to two smoothing terms for weather variables. The multipollutant models in these studies generally did not alter NO 2 risk estimates, except for the Netherlands study. The meta-analy sis by Stieb et al. (2003) shows a smaller combined risk estimate for the multipollutant mode ls than that for single-pollutant models, but since these are not from the same set of studies (11 studies for single-pollutant models and 3 studies for multipollutant models), it is not cl ear how much of the di fference was due to the addition of copollutants. Thus, the evidence of confounding, in the sense of instability of risk estimates in multipollutant models, is not clea r from these studies. The difference in risk estimates due to lag/averaging time also was not clear from these studies. In the Canadian study, the estimate for the 3-day average (2.0%) a nd that for 1-day lag (2.4%, though this was based on ever y-6th-day data, to match with PM 2.5 data) were similar in magnitude. In the Netherlands study, the estim ate for the 1-day lag (1.9%) and that for the average of 0 to 6 days (1.5%) were not very di fferent. In the Samoli et al. (2006) study, they examined a polynomial distributed lag, and reported that the combined risk estimate for total mortality was 23% larger (45% larger for respir atory mortality) than th at for the average of 0- and 1-day lags. However, such a pattern was no t consistently clear on the city-to-city basis. Thus, while the risk estimates for multiday effect s may be larger than the single-day or 1- to 2-day average risk estimates, the evidence so fa r indicates that the magnitude of such multiday risk estimates are not much bigger than the 1-or 2-day average estimates. Among the 1-day risk estimates, the association at 1-day lag was gene rally the strongest in these multicity studies. In summary, the range of NO 2 total mortality risk estim ates is 0.5 to 3.6% per 20-ppb increase in the 24-h average NO 2 (or 30-ppb increase in the da ily 1-h maximum). The risk estimates are generally insensitive to the inclusio n of copollutants. Multiday effects have been suggested, but their magnitude, when expressed pe r the same increment, is not very different from those for 1-or 2-day average exposure in dices. A few studies examined association August 2007 3-94 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 between cause-specific mortality and NO 2. While NO 2 risk estimates for some specific causes were found to be larger than for all-cause mortality, such a pattern was not unique to NO 2. 3.3.1.9 Cause-Specific Mortality from Short-Term Exposure to NO 2 Risk estimates for specific causes of death w ould be useful in evaluating consistency of the association with causal inference. However, comparing relative size of risk estimates across categories of different mean da ily counts (e.g., all-cause versus respiratory) requires caution when the \"best lag\" estimates are chosen from se veral lags. This is because the range of risk estimates for the smaller daily mean counts are expect ed to be larger due to larger standard error of estimates, and the \"best lag\" choice would resu lt in a larger bias for the category with smaller mean counts. Thus, it would be more appropria te to compare risk estimates across different cause-specific categories using the same lag (unless there is a strong indica tion that lag structure of associations would be different among the different causes). Several multicity studies provided risk estim ates for broad cause-specific categories (typically all-cause, cardiovascular , and respiratory) using consis tent lags/averaging for broad specific causes. In the Canadian 12 -city study (Burnett et al., 2004), the NO 2 excess risk estimates for all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and respiratory mortality were 2.0% (95% per 20-ppb increase in the average of 0 to 2 day lags of 24-h average NO 2, respectively, suggesting no difference in risk estimates among these categories. In the Samoli et al. (2006) APHEA2 analysis of 30 European cities, estimated increases in all-cause, cardi ovascular, and respiratory (95% CI: 1.0, 3.4) per 30-ppb increase in the average of 0- and 1-day lag daily 1-h max NO 2, respectively. In Biggeri et al. (2005) analysis of eight Italian cities, the NO 2 risk estimates for all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality were 3.6% (95% CI: (95% CI: 0.2, 11.2), respectively, per 20-ppb increase in the average of 0- and 1-day lags of 24-h average NO 2. In the Australian four-c ity study (Simpson et al., 2005b), the risk estimates for all- cause, cardiovascular, and respir atory mortality were 3.4% (95% CI: 3.5, respectively, per 20-ppb increase in the average of 0- and 1-day lags of 24-h average NO 2. In the Netherlands study, the risk estimates for all-cause (2.6% [95% CI: 1.2, 4.0] per 20-ppb increase in the average of 0 through 6 day lags of daily August 2007 3-95 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 24-h average NO 2) and cardiovascular (2.7% [95% CI: 0.7, 4.7]) deaths were 11.5, 29.0]) were much larger. These results suggest that, with some exceptions, the risk estimates for cardiovascular and respiratory causes are larger than that for all-cause mortality. However, it should be noted that this pattern was not unique to NO 2\u2014other pollutants often showed similar patterns. There are numerous sing le-city studies (see the annex table) that also examined broad specific causes (cardiovascular and respiratory), but the patterns are not al ways consistent, likely due to smaller sample size, or the lags reporte d were not consistent ac ross the specific causes examined. Some of the single-city studies examined mo re specific causes within cardiovascular or respiratory causes. In the Neth erlands study (Hoek et al., 2001; reanalysis Hoek, risk estimates for heart failure (7.6% [95% CI: 1.4, 1 4.2] per the average of 0- through 6-day lags of 24-h average NO 2) and cerebrovascular disease were larger than those for total cardiovascular (2.7% [95% CI: 0.7, 4.7]) causes. Howe ver, such a pattern was seen for PM 10, CO, and SO 2 as well. In the Goldberg et al. ( 2003) analysis of Montreal data, the risk estimates for the death with underlying cause of CHF and those deaths classified as ha ving CHF 1 year before death (through the universal insurance plan) were compar ed. They did not find associations between air pollution and those with unde rlying cause of CHF, but they found associations between some of the air pollutants examined (i.e., CoH, SO 2, NO 2) and the deaths that were classified as having CHF 1 year before death. Again, the association with the specific cause of death was not unique to NO 2. This pattern of association between multiple pollutants, including but not specific to NO 2, and specific causes of deaths were seen for asthma mortality (Saez et al., 1999), mortality in a cohort with COPD (Garcia-Aymerich et al., 2000; Sunyer and Basagana, 2001), mortality in a cohort with severe asthma (Sunyer et al., 2002 ), infant mortality (Loomis et al., 1999), intrauterine mortality (Pereira et al., 1998), and mortality in a cohort of patients with CHF (Kwon et al., 2001). While NO 2 may have contributed to these associations as part of the mixture of pollutants or as a surrogate index, thes e studies cannot be used to evaluate specificity of NO 2 effects on these specific causes of death. In summary, both broad specifi c (cardiovascular and respir atory) and more specific causes/categories of death have been shown to be associated with NO 2. However, since other August 2007 3-96 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 pollutants also showed similar associations with these causes or categories, it is difficult to discuss consistency with causal inference that is specific to NO 2. 3.3.3 Summary of Effects of Short-Term Exposure to NO x on Mortality Range of mortality risk estimates: In the short-term studies, the range of NO 2 total mortality risk estimates is 0.5 to 3.6% pe r 20-ppb increase in the 24-h average NO 2 (or 30-ppb increase in the daily 1-h maximum). Various lag/averaging days and di stributed lags do not appear to alter the estimates substantially. Confounding: In the large multic ity time-series studies, the NO 2 risk estimates were generally insensitive to the incl usion of copollutants in the m odels. In that sense, strong evidence of confounding is not indicated in the short-term studies' results. NO 2 (or NO x) as a surrogate marker: The issue of NO 2 being a surrogate marker of another pollutant or for a pollution type is probably the most important one in interpreting NO 2 risk estimates, but currently available informa tion is not sufficient to establish quantitative characterization of such surrogacy. NO 2 has been suggested to be a surrogate marker of traffic- related air pollution, ultrafine particles, fine part icles, and weather conditions. The fact that NO 2 plays a critical role in the photochemical r eactions that produce other potentially harmful pollutants make it difficult to treat NO 2 simply as a surrogate marker or confounder. More characterization of the surrogate marker is needed from different geographic locations. Increasingly available PM speciatio n data may help this effort. Concentration-response function: One multic ity time-series study (Samoli et al., 2006) examined this issue. There was no indication of a threshold, and the concentration-response curves were consistent w ith linear hypothesis. Effect modification: Only few studies in th e short-term effects studies examined possible effect modifiers. The APHEA2 time-series an alysis found that the most important effect modifier was the geographical ar ea (eastern citie s had lower NO 2 risk estimates than western or southern cities). For respiratory mo rtality, cities with high median PM 10 showed higher risk estimates. The Canadian 12 cities study reporte d that the risk estimate was higher in summer than in winter. Older age groups also showed larger risk estimates. Sensitivity of risk estimates to model specification: Most time-series studies examined the sensitivity of risk estimates to alternativ e model specifications by changing the degrees of August 2007 3-97 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 freedom for smoothing terms to adjust for temporal trends and weather effects, and the changes in risk estimates were typically not substantial (i.e., <30%). However, these studies did not apply qualitatively different alternative models (i.e., different number of smoothing terms) that are found across studies. One study using the N MMAPS data did find that varying degrees of freedom for temporal adjustment made a 2-fold change in the PM mortality risk estimate. Similar attempts should be made to examine sensitiv ity of risk estimates to qualitatively different weather model specifications. 3.3.4 Integration of Evidence Re lated to Mortality and Short-Term Exposure to NO 2 In evaluating the risk estimates for mortalit y, the main focus is on multicity studies and meta-analyses. These studies of short-term mortality effects include the NMMAPS, Canadian multi-cities studies, APHEA, Italia n 8 cities study, the Netherlands study, the Australian 4 cities study, and the Stieb et al. (2002, 2003) meta-analyses. The largest U.S. study of 90 cities showed a NO 2-mortality association with a total mortal ity risk estimate at lag 1 of 0.25% per 10 ppb or 0.50% per 20 ppb. A Canadian 12-city study (Burnett et al., 2004) showed an NO 2 mortality risk estimate of 2.0% per 20-ppb in crease in the 3-day moving average of NO 2. These acute mortality studies are described in detail in Annex Table AX6.7 and summarized in Figure 3.3-3. The range of NO 2 total mortality risk estimates is 0.5 to 3.6% per 20-ppb increase in the 24-h average of NO 2 (or 30-ppb increase in the daily 1-h maximum). As stated above, controlled human exposure st udies, by necessity, are limited to acute, fully reversible functional and/or symptomatic res ponses in healthy or mildly asthmatic subjects. Animal studies have not used mortality as an endpoint in acute exposure studies. However, a number of animal studies (described in Section 2.3) have shown biochemi cal, lung host defense, permeability, and inflammation effects with acute exposures that may provide limited biological plausibility for mortality in susceptible individuals. A 5-ppm NO 2 exposure for 24 h in rats caused increases in blood and lung total GSH and a similar exposure resulte d in impairment of alveolar surface tension of surfactant phospholipids due to altered fatty acid content. A fairly large body of literature describes the effects of NO 2 on lung host defenses at low exposures. However, most of these effects are seen only with subchronic or chronic exposure, and therefore, do not correlate well with the short lag times ev idenced in the epidemiological studies.

Six studies are listed in Annex Table AX6.6-1, three from the United States and three from Europe. Three of the studies involved lung f unction in children and three report lung function studies in adults. The Children's Health Study (CHS) in Californi a is a longitudinal c ohort study designed to investigate the effect of chronic exposure to several air contaminates (including NO 2) on respiratory health in children. Twelve California communities were selected based on historical data indicating different levels of specific pollutants. In each community, monitoring sites were set up to measure NO 2, O3, and PM 10 hourly and average PM 2.5 and acid vapor every 2 weeks. Children were recruited though local schools in grades 4, 7, and 10. Questionnaires were distributed though the schools and an swered with parental help. Lung function was measured for each child using portable equipment at the school. The study followed children for 10 years, with annual questionnaires and lung function measurement. In 2004, Gauderman reported results for 8-year follow up of the children enrolled in grade 4 (n = 1759). Exposure to NO 2 was significantly associated with deficits in lung growth over the 8-year period. The difference in FVC fo r children exposed to the lowest versus the highest levels of NO 2 (34.6 ppb) was !95.0 mL. (95% CI: (95% CI: !165.5 (95% CI: !377.6, !44.4). Results were similar for boys and girls and among children who did not have a history of asthma. These deficits in growth of lung function resulted in clinically significant differences in FEV 1 at age 18. The study had the following important characteristics: it was prospective; exposure a nd outcome data were collected in a consistent August 2007 3-99 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 manner over the duration of the study; and conf ounding by SES was controlled in the models and by selecting communities similar in demographic characteristics at the outset. In addition, the NO 2 concentration associated with deficits in lung growth was 34.6 ppb (39.0 ppb highest mean !4.4 ppb lowest mean), a level below the current standard. Similar results were reported for acid vapor (resulting primarily from photochemical conversions of NO x to HNO 3), with a difference in FVC are depicted in Figure 3.4-1. The authors concluded that the effects of NO 2 could not be distinguished fr om the effects of particles (PM 2.5 and PM 10). NO 2 was strongly correlated with thes e other contaminants (0.79, and 0.67, respectively). For example, exposure to the highest versus the lowest PM 2.5 concentrations was associated with a difference in FEV 1 of !79.7 mL (95% CI: !153.0, !6.4). The effects on growth in lung function in this study cannot be attributed to O 3. O 3 was not correlated with NO 2 (!0.11), and no significant effects of O 3 were detected (difference in FEV 1 !22.8 (95% CI: !122.3, 76.6). Gauderman et resu lts of an 8-year follow-up on 3,677 children who participated in the CHS in California. Briefly, this st udy recruited schoolchildren in 12 California communities with differing levels of air pollution. Each child had lung function measurements taken at school each year for 8 ye ars. Children living <500 m from a freeway (n = 440) had significant deficits in lung growth over the 8-year follow-up compared to children who lived at least 1500 m from a fr eeway. The difference in FVC was !63 mL (!131 the 1 !81 mL ( !243 to !11). This study did not attempt to measure sp ecific pollutants near freeways or to estimate exposure to specific pollutants for study subjec ts. Thus, while the study presents important findings with respect to traffic pollution and respiratory health in children, it does not provide evidence that NO 2 is responsible for these deficits in lung growth. Avol et al. (2001) studied the effect of relocating to areas of differing air pollution levels in 110 10-year-old children who were participa ting in the CHS. As a group, subjects who had moved to areas of lower PM 10 showed increased growth in lung function and the same relationship was observed for NO 2. In general, the authors fo cused on associations with PM, where larger and significant effects were obs erved; associations were reported with NO 2, but they did not reach statistical significance.

Peters (1999) reported the initial results from the CHS. This was a cross-sectional analysis of lung func tion tests conducted on 3,293 children in the first y ear of the study. Both NO 2 and PM 10 were associated with decreases in FVC, FEV 1, and MMEF. O 3 was associated with decreases in MMEF and PEFR. For all pollutants, the decreases were only significant for girls. In the United States, a study was conducted of students attending the University of California (Berkeley) who had b een lifelong residents of the Los Angeles or San Francisco areas (Tager, 2005). Using geocoded address historie s, a lifetime exposure to air pollution was constructed for each student. Increasing lifetime exposure to NO 2 was associated with decreased FEF 75 and FEF 25-75. Controlling for O 3 in the models, however, substantially reduced the effect of NO 2. In Germany, Moseler (1994) measured NO 2 outside the homes of 467 children, including 106 who had physician-diagnosed asthma. Five of six lung function parameters were reduced among asthmatic children exposed to NO 2 at concentrations >21 ppb. No significant reductions in lung function were detected among children without asthma. The SAPALDIA (Study of Air Pollution and Lung Diseases in Adults) study (Ackermann-Liebrich, 1997) compared 9,651 adults (age 18 to 60) in eight different regions in Switzerland. Significant associations of NO 2, SO 2, and PM 10 with FEV 1 and FVC were found with a 10-\u00b5g/m3 increase in annual average exposure. Due to the high correlations between NO 2 and the other pollutants (SO 2 = 0.86, PM 10 = 0.91), it was difficult to assess the effect of a specific pollutant. A random subsample of 560 adults from SAPALDIA recorded personal measurements of NO 2 and measurements of NO 2 outside their homes (S chindler, 1998). Using the personal and home measurements of NO 2, similar associations were reported between NO 2 with FEV 1 and FVC. Goss et al. (2004) examined the relationship of ambient pollutants on individuals with cystic fibrosis using the Cys tic Fibrosis Foundation National Pa tient Registry in 1999 and 2000. Exposure was assessed by linking air pollution values from the Aerometric Information Retrieval System with the patient's home zip code. Associations were reported between PM and exacerbations or lung function changes, but no clear associations were found for NO 2, SO 2, O3, August 2007 3-102 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 and CO. The odds of patients with cystic fibros is having two or more pulmonary exacerbations during 2000 per 10 ppb NO 2 is 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.01). Toxicology Studies A limited number of animal studies, es pecially those using spikes of NO 2, have shown decrements in vital capacity and lung distensibility, which may provide biological plausibility for these lung function findings. NO 2 concentrations in many urban areas of the United States and elsewhere consist of spikes superimposed on a rela tively constant background level. Miller et al. (1987) evaluated this urban pattern of NO 2 exposure in mice using continuous 7 days/week, 23 h/day exposures to 0.2-ppm NO 2 with twice daily (5 days/week) 1-h spike exposures to 0.8-ppm NO 2 for 32 and 52 weeks. Mice exposed to clean air and to the constant background concentration of 0.2-ppm NO 2 served as controls. Vital capac ity tended to be lower (p = 0.054) in mice exposed to NO 2 with diurnal spikes than in mice e xposed to air. Lung distensibility, measured as respiratory system compliance, also tended to be lower in mice exposed to diurnal spikes of NO 2 compared with constant NO 2 exposure or air exposure. These changes suggest that #52 weeks of low-level NO 2 exposure with diurnal spikes may produce a subtle decrease in lung distensibility, although part of this loss in compliance may be a reflection of the reduced vital capacity. Vital capac ity appeared to remain suppressed for at least 30 days after exposure. Lung morphology in these mice was ev aluated only by light microsc opy (a relatively insensitive method) and showed no exposure-related lesions. The decrease in lung distensibility suggested by this study is consistent with the thickening of collagen fibrils in monkeys (Bils, 1976) and the increase in lung collagen synthesis rates of rats (Last et al., 1983) after exposure to higher levels of NO 2. Tepper et al. (1993) expo sed rats to 0.5-ppm NO 2, 22 h/day, 7 days/week, with a 2-h spike of 1.5-ppm NO 2, 5 days/week for up to 78 weeks. No effects on pulmonary function were observed between 1 and 52 weeks of exposure. However, after 78 weeks of exposure, flow at 25% forced vital capacity was decreased, perhaps indicating ai rways obstruction. A significant decrease in the frequency of br eathing was also observed at 78 weeks that was paralleled by a trend toward increased expiratory resistance and expiratory time. Taken together, these results suggest that few, if any, signifi cant effects were seen that su ggest incipient lung degeneration.

(1988), who exposed 1-day- and 7-week-old ra ts to continuous base lines of 0.5-, 1.0-, and 2.0-ppm NO 2 with twice daily 1-h spikes at three time s these baseline concentrations for 1, 3, or 7 weeks. In neonatal rats, v ital capacity and respiratory system compliance increased following 3 weeks, but not 6 weeks, of exposure to the 1.0- and 2.0-ppm NO 2 baselines with spikes. In young adult rats, respiratory system compliance d ecreased following 6 weeks of exposure, and body weight decreased following 3 and 6 weeks of e xposure to the 2-ppm baseline with spike. In the young adult rats, pulmonary function chan ges returned to normal values 3 weeks after exposure ceased. A correlated morphometric study (Chang et al., 1986) is summarized in Section 3.4.1.2 below. Lafuma et al. (1987) exposed 12-week-old ha msters with and without laboratory-induced (elastase) emphysema to 2.0-ppm NO 2, 8 h/day, 5 days/week for 8 w eeks. Vital capacity and pulmonary compliance were not affected by NO 2 exposure. There were no effects on pulmonary function (lung resistance, dynamic compliance) in NO 2-exposed rabbits that were immunized intraperit oneally within 24-h of birth until 3 months of age to either Alternaria tenuis or house dust mite antigen. The rabbits were given intraperitoneal injections once weekly for 1 month, and then every 2 weeks thereafter and exposed to 4-ppm NO 2 for 2-h daily (Douglas et al., 1994). 3.4.1.2 Morphological Effects Animal toxicology studies demonstrate mor phological changes to the respiratory tract from exposure to NO 2 that may provide further biological plau sibility for the decrements in lung function growth observed in epidemiological studies discussed above. The centriacinar region is most sensitive to NO 2 and is where injury is first noted. This region includes the terminal conducting airways (terminal bronchioles), respiratory bronchioles, and adjacent alveolar ducts and alveoli. The upper respirator y tract (i.e., nasal cavity) does not appear to be much affected by NO 2 exposure. Within the centriacinar region, cell injury occurs in the ciliated cells of the bronchiolar epithelium and the type 1 cells of the alveolar epithe lium, which are then replaced with nonciliated bronchiolar (Clara) cells and type II cells, respectively. Permanent alterations resembling emphysema-like disease may result from chronic exposure. There is a large degree of interspecies variability in re sponsiveness to NO 2; this is clearly evident from those few early studies where di fferent species were exposed under identical August 2007 3-104 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 conditions (Wagner et al., 1965; Furiosi et al., 1973; Azoulay-Dupuis et al., 1983). This variability may be due to dosimetric differences in effective dose of NO 2 reaching target sites, but other species differences may play a role. Guinea pigs, hamsters, and monkeys all appear to be more severely affected morphol ogically by equivalent exposure to NO 2 than are rats, the most commonly used experimental animal. However, in most cases, similar types of histological lesions are produced when similar e ffective concentrations are used. Time Course Several investigators have studied the tem poral progression of early events due to NO 2 exposure in the rat (e.g., Freeman et al., 1966, 1968, 1972; Stephens et al., 1971, 1972; Evans et al., 1972, 1973a,b, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977; Cabral-Ande rson et al., 1977; Rombout et al., 1986) and guinea-pig (Sherwin et al., 1973). Thes e studies observed incr eased AM aggregation, desquamation of type I cells and ciliated bronchiol ar cells, and accumulation of fibrin in small airways as the earliest alterati ons resulting from exposure to NO 2. These alterations were seen within 24 to 72-h of exposure to NO 2 concentrations of $2.0 ppm. However, repair of injured tissue and replacement of destroyed cells begins within 24 to 48-h of continuous exposure. The new cells in the bronchiolar are derived from nonciliated bronch iolar (Clara) cells, whereas in the alveoli, the damaged type I cells are replaced with type II cells. One feature of the new cells is that they are relatively resistant to effects of continued NO 2 exposure. The time course of alveolar lesions was also investigated by Kubota et al. (1987) in rats continuously exposed to 0.04- to 4.0-ppm NO 2, 24 h/day for up to 27 months. One phase, which lasted for 9 to 18 months of exposure, consisted of a decrease in number a nd an increase in cell volume of type 1 epithelium, an increase in the number and volume of type II cells, and an increase in the relative ratio of type II to type I cells. A second phase, between 18 to 27 months of exposure, showed some recovery of the alveolar epithelium, but the tota l volume of interstitial tissue decreased, while collagen fibers in the interstitium increased. These findings indicate that some lesions, i.e., epithelial cha nges, tend to resolve, at least partially, with continued chronic exposure to low concentrations and to resolv e rapidly during postexposure periods. At 0.4 ppm, the authors reported that the lesion typically was milder and its initiation delayed, compared to the higher concentration. At 0.4 and 4.0 ppm, morphometric increases in the mean alveolar thickness of the air-blood tissue barrier in the rats were also observed. According to the authors, August 2007 3-105 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 these interstitial changes were considered to be progressive and leading to fibrosis, rather than resolving as do epithelial changes. In a more recent study, Barth et al., (1994a) eval uated cell proliferation at three different levels (bronchial, bronchiolar epit helium, and type II cells) in the lungs of rats exposed to 0, 0.8-, 5-, or 10-ppm NO 2, 24 h/day for 1 or 3 days. The highest rate of cell proliferation occurred in the bronchiolar epithelium. Cell proliferation was increased in type II cells after exposure to 5-ppm NO 2 for 3 days and 10-ppm NO 2 for 1 or 3 days. In the bronchiolar epithelium, cell proliferation was increased at 0.8 ppm and a bove for both 1 and 3 days. Increased cell proliferation (AgNOR-number only) in the bronchial epithelium was observed in animals exposed to 10 ppm for 3 days. Rats were also exposed continuously to NO 2 at 0, 5, 10, or 20 ppm continuously for 3 or 25 days (Barth et al., 1994b, 1995; Barth and Mulle r, 1999). The highest proliferative activity was in the respiratory bronchiolar epithelium (B arth et al., 1994b; Barth and Muller, 1999). After 3 days of exposure, cell proliferation in th e bronchiolar epithelium was increased 3-fold in the 5-ppm exposure group and remained elevated at the same level in the next two higher-concentration groups. The bronchial epithelium showed a different pattern, with a dose-dependent increase in the 10- and 20-ppm expos ure groups. After 25 da ys, cell proliferation levels were increased in both the bronchiolar and bronchial epithelium in the 10- and 20-ppm groups. The increase was dose-dependent and th ere was no significant difference in the levels between the two tissues. Pulmonary tissue damage, vascular altera tions, Clara cell prol iferation, and tissue- specific localization of NO 2 effects were all found to be both exposure duration- and concentration-dependent (Barth et al., 1995; Bart h and Muller, 1999). After 3 days of exposure, there were histopathological cha nges extending from slight intersti tial edema after exposure to 5 ppm, to epithelial necrosis a nd interstitial inflammatory inf iltration after exposure to 10 ppm, and an additional intra-alveolar edema after 20 ppm. Clara cells from the lungs of all NO 2-exposed groups lost the apical intraluminal projections, and the damaged epithelium was covered by a layer of CC10 reactive material. Th ese changes in Clara ce lls were not observed after 25 days of exposure. Exposur e for 25 days to 10- and 20-ppm NO 2 resulted in a dose-linear increase of cell proliferation in the bronchial and br onchiolar epithelium. Double labeling of August 2007 3-106 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 CC10 and BrdU showed that cell proliferation was restricted to Clara cells , an indication of the progenitor role of Clara cells in oxidative stress injury in the lung tissue. Morphometry studies showed that alveolar circumference was increased and alveolar surface density was decreased after an exposure to 20 ppm after 3 days and to 10 and 20 ppm after 25 days (Barth et al., 1994b, 1995). No signif icant alveolar changes were observed in the 5-ppm exposure groups. The average medial thickness (AMT) of the pulmonary arteries was decreased in the 5-ppm group at both 3 and 25 days; AMT was increased in the 10-ppm group after 25 days and in the 37,600-\u00b5g/m 3 (20 ppm) group after 3 and 25 days (Barth et al., 1994b, 1995). The AMT and alveolar density were negativ ely correlated (coeffici ent of correlation: !0.56), suggesting that pulmonary tissue damage a nd vascular alterations are closely related (Barth et al., 1995). These high exposure studie s undoubtedly initiate mechan isms of injury that do not occur at more relevant near-ambient exposu res, so little insight can be gained with these histopathology and morphometry st udies in animals regarding these epidemiological findings. Effects of NO 2 as a Function of Exposure Pattern Few morphological studies ha ve been designed to evalua te modifying factors to NO 2 exposures, such as the exposure duration and co ncentration relationship, short-term peaks in concentration, or cycles of exposure and postexposure. The relative roles of concentration and time in response to subchronic exposure have been investigated by Rombout et al. (1986). Rats were expose d from 0.53 to 10.6 ppm for up to 28 days; or to 10.2 ppm for either a single 6-h exposure, 6 h/day for 28 days, or 24 h/day for 28 days. Exposure concentration played a more important role in induc ing lung epithelial cell lesions than did expos ure duration provided C H T was constant. The eff ect of concentration was stronger with intermittent exposure than with continuous exposure. Few studies have examined ambient NO 2 patterns consisting of a low baseline level with transient spikes of NO 2, as exists in the environment. However, in some cases, there was no group at the baseline exposure , preventing evaluation of the contribution of peaks to the responses. Gregory et al . (1983) exposed rats (14 to 16 weeks old) for 7 h/day, 5 days/week for up to 15 weeks to NO 2 at 1.0 or 5.0 or 1.0 ppm with two 1.5-h spikes of 5.0 ppm per day. After 15 weeks of exposure, histopathologic changes we re minimal, with fo cal hyperinflation and August 2007 3-107 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 areas of subpleural accumulation of macrophages f ound in some of the animals exposed either to the baseline of 5.0 ppm or to 1.0 ppm with the 5.0-ppm spikes. Port et al. (1977) observed dilated respirat ory bronchioles and alveolar ducts in mice exposed to 0.1-ppm NO 2 with daily 2-h peaks to 1.0 ppm fo r 6 months. Miller et al. (1987) found no morphological effects in mice exposed for 1 year, although host defense functional changes were noted (see Section 4.3.2). Changes in the proximal alveolar and term inal bronchiolar regions in response to exposure to baseline NO 2 concentration plus NO 2 spikes were also investigated in the rat. Crapo et al. (1984) and Chang et al. ( 1986) exposed rats for 6 weeks to a baseline concentration of 0.5- or 2.0-ppm NO 2, 23 h/day for 7 days/week, onto which were superimposed two daily 30- min spikes of three times the baseline concentration for 5 days/week. Morphometric analyses showed increases in the volumes of the type 2 ep ithelium, surface area of t ype II cells, interstitial matrix, and AMs; no changes were seen in the volu me of fibroblasts at th e lower concentration. Most of the changes were also noted at the highe r exposure level, and in some cases, the change was greater than that at the lower level (i.e., incr ease in type 1 and type 2 epithelial volume). At both levels of exposure, the increase in the volum e of type II cells and interstitial fibroblasts were not accompanied by significant changes in their numbers, but the number of AMs decreased. At the highest exposure, the number of type I cells decreased and their average surface area increased. Generally, there was a sp reading and hypertrophy of type II cells. A correlation between decreased comp liance (Stevens et al., 1988) a nd thickening of the alveolar interstitium was found (see Section 3.3.1.1 for detail s of the pulmonary function portion of the study). Examination of the terminal bronchiolar region revealed no effects at the lower exposure level. At the higher level, there was a 19% decrease in ciliated cells per unit area of the epithelial basement membrane and a reduction in the mean ciliated surface area. The size of the dome protrusions of nonciliated bronchiolar (Clara) cells was decreased, giving the bronchial epithelium a flattened appearance, but there was no change in the number of cells. Factors Affecting Susceptibility to Morphological Changes Susceptibility to morphological effects may be influenced by many factors, such as age, compromised lung function, and acute infections. Age of the animal at the time of exposure may be responsible for some of the variability in morphological res ponse seen in the same species exposed to comparable concentrations. August 2007 3-108 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 It appears that neonates, prior to weaning, are re latively resistant to NO 2, and that responsiveness then increases (Ste vens et al., 1978). Furthermore, the responsiveness of mature animals appears to decline somewhat with age, until an increase in responsiveness occurs at some point in senescence. However, the morphological response to NO 2 in animals of different ages involves similarities in the cell types affected and in the nature of the damage incurred. Age-related differences occur in the extent of damage and in the time required for repair, the latter taking longer in older anim als. The reasons for age differe nces in susceptibility are not known but may involve toxicokinetic and toxico dynamic differences during different growth phases. Kyono and Kawai (1982) exposed rats at 1, 3, 12, and 21 months of age continuously for 1 month to 0.11-, 0.46-, 2.8-, or 8.8-ppm NO 2. Light and electron micr oscopic analyses were used, and various morphometric parameters we re assessed, including arithmetic mean thickness of the air-blood barrier and the volume density of various alveolar wall components. Because these investigators were interested in the e ffect of the overall gas-exchange area, they deliberately excluded the centriaci nar alveolar region, site of main damage. Analysis of individual results was complex, but depending up on the animal's age and the specified endpoint, exposure levels as low as 0.11 ppm changed spec ific morphometric parameters. There was a trend towards a concentration-de pendent increase in air-blood ba rrier thickness in all age groups, with evidence of age-related differences in respon se. At any concentration, the response of this endpoint decreased in rats from 1 to 12 months old, but increased again in 21-month-old animals. Type I and II cells showed various degrees of response, depending on both age at onset of exposure and exposure concentration. The response of each lung component did not always show a simple concentration-dependent incr ease or decrease, but suggested a multiphasic reaction pattern. Kyono and Kawai (1982) may not have used the most susceptible animal model. Azoulay-Dupuis et al. (1983) inve stigated the species and ag e-related susceptibility to morphological changes by exposing both rats and guinea pigs aged 5 to >60 days old to 2.0 and 10 ppm for 3 days. There was no mortality in the rats; however, mortality increased with increasing age in guinea pigs exposed to 10 ppm. In both species, older animals showed greater effects of exposure than did neonate s. Rats at all ages and guinea pigs less than 45 days old were not affected. The 45-day-old guin ea pigs showed thickening of al veolar walls, alveolar edema, August 2007 3-109 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 and inflammation; animals older than 45 days showed similar, but more frequent, alterations that seemed to increase with age. Adults also had focal loss of cilia in bronchioli. Age-related responsiveness to an urban pattern of NO 2 was evaluated by Chang et al. (1986, 1988) using 1-day- or 6-week-old rats ex posed for 6 weeks to a baseline of 0.5-ppm NO 2 for 23 h/day, 7 days/week, with two 1-h spikes (g iven in the morning an d afternoon) of 1.5 ppm 5 days/week. Electron microscopi c morphometric analysis of the proximal alveolar regions showed an increase in the surface density of th e alveolar basement membrane in the older animals that was not seen in the younger anim als. Although both age groups responded in a generally similar manner, the 6-week -old rats seemed to be generally more susceptible to injury than were the 1-day-olds, as the 6-week old an imals had more variables that were significantly different from their control group. There was no qualitative evidence of morphological injury in the terminal bronchioles of the younger rats, but there was a 19% in crease in the average ciliated cell surface that was not evident in the older rats . In addition, there wa s a 13% increase in the mean luminal surface area of Clara cells in the younger versus control animals of the same age. Pulmonary function was also altered in similarly exposed rats (Stevens et al., 1988) (see Section 3.3.1.1). Interpretation of the neonatal effects is di fficult. Assuming that rats prior to weaning are more resistant to NO 2 (Stevens et al., 1978) (see below), effects observed after a 6-week exposure from birth may have resulted from the la st 3 weeks of exposure, as the first 3 weeks may constitute a more resistant period. In contrast, effects observed in young adults probably reflect the impact of the entire 6-week expos ure. These findings ma y parallel the effects observed in the CHS studies reviewed above, identif ying school-age children as vulnerable to the effects of NO 2. Few studies have been conducted on effects in individuals with pr eexisting respiratory disease with exposure to e nvironmental levels of NO 2. These studies include animals with laboratory-induced emphysema or infections. Morphometric analys es of lungs from normal and elastase-induced emphysematous hamsters (2 months old) that had b een exposed to 2.0-ppm NO 2 for 8 h/day, 5 days/week, for 8 weeks, i ndicated that emphysematous lesions were exacerbated by NO 2 (i.e., NO 2 increased pulmonary volume and decreased internal alveolar surface area) (Lafuma et al. (1987) . The investigators suggested that these results may imply a role for NO 2 in enhancing pre-existing emphysema. A study by Fenters et al. (1973) also reported that acute infectious (influenza) lung disease enhanced the morphological effects of August 2007 3-110 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 NO 2 in squirrel monkeys when these animals were exposed continuously to 1.0-ppm NO 2 for 16 months. 3.4.1.3 Asthma Prevalence and Incidence\u2014Children Among the studies reporting results from the United States in regard to asthma prevalence incidence associated with NO 2 exposure, several publications from the CHS in California report results. Gauderman et al., 2005 conducted a study of children randomly selected from the CHS with exposure measured at children's homes. Although only 208 were enrolled, exposure to NO 2 was strongly associated with both lifetime history of asthma, and asthma medications use. Gauderman et al. (2005) measured ambient NO 2 with Palmes tubes attached at the subjects' homes at the roofline eaves, signposts, or rain gutters at an approximate height of 2 m above the ground. Samples were deployed for 2-week periods in both summer and fall. Traffic-related pollutants were characte rized by 3 metrics: (1) proximity of home to freeway, (2) average number of vehicles within 150 meters, and (3) model-based estimates. Yearly average NO 2 levels within the 10 communities ranged from 12.9 to 51.5 ppb. The average NO 2 concentration measured at home was asso ciated with asthma prevalence (OR = 8.33 [95% CI: 1.15, 59.87] per 20 ppb) with similar re sults by season and when taking into account several potential confounders. Tables 3.4-1 and 3.4-2 show associations with several indicators of traffic-related air pollution and as thma. In each community measured, NO 2 was more strongly correlated with estimates of freeway-related pollution than with non-freeway-related pollution. In a related CHS study, McConnell et al. (2006) studied the relati onship of proximity to major roads and asthma and found a positive relationship. Further evaluation of exposure estimation was done in this cohort of schoolchildren (Molitor et al., 2007). Several models of interurb an air pollution exposure we re used to classify and predict FVC in an integrated Bayesian modeling framework, using three interurban predictors: distance to a freeway; tr affic density; and predicted average NO 2 exposure from the California line source dispersion (CALINE4) model. Results sugge sted that the inclusion of residual spatial terms can reduce un certainty in the prediction of e xposures and associated health effects (Molitor et al., 2007). Islam et al. (2007) studied whether lung functi on is associated with new onset asthma and whether this relationship varies by exposure to ambient air pollu tants by examining a cohort of 2,057 fourth-grade children who were asthma- and wheeze-free at the st art of the CHS and August 2007 3-111 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 followed them for 8 years. A hierarchal model was used to evaluate the effect of individual air pollutants (NO 2, PM 10, PM 2.5, and acid vapor, O 3, EC, and OC) on the association of lung function with asthma as shown in Figure 3.4-2. Th e loss of the protective effect from better lung function can be appreciated from these graphs. PM indicators were significantly related, and NO 2 was marginally significant (p = 0.06). This study shows that better airflow, characterized by higher FEF 25-75 and FEV 1 during childhood was associated with decreased risk of new onset asthma during adolescence. However, exposur e to high levels of ambient pollutants (NO 2 and others) attenuated this protective associat ion of lung function on asthma occurrence. Brauer et al. (2007) assessed the development of asthmatic/allergic symptoms and respiratory infections during the first 4 years of life in a birth cohort study (n = 4.000, but the number of participants decreased over the study to ~3500) in th e Netherlands. The mean NO 2 concentration was 13.1 ppb. Air pollution concentrations at th e home address at birth were calculated by a model combining air pollution measurements with a Geographic Information System (GIS). This exposure model was validated. The associat ion between exposure and health outcomes was analyzed by multiple logistic regression in th e adjustment for confounding variables. The interquartile range in increase in NO 2 was 10.6 \u00b5g/m3. Wheeze, doctor-diagnosed asthma, and flu and serious colds were associated with air pollutants (considered traffic-related: NO 2, PM 2.5, soot); for example, NO 2 was associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma (OR = 1.28 [95% CI: 1.04, 1.56) for a cumulative lifetime indicator. Jerrett (2007) comments on this study that (1) the effects are larger and more consistent than in participants of the same study at age 2; (2) these effects suggest that onset and persistence of respiratory disease formation begins at an early age and continues; and (3 ) the more sophisticated method for exposure assessment used based on spa tially and temporally representative field measurements and land use regression is capable of capturing small area variations in traffic pollutants. Importantly, this study is one of the few assessing disease incidence in the same manner as the CHS discussed above. Kim et al. (2004a) reported positive associations for girls to both NO 2 and NO x in the San Francisco bay area. They studied 1,109 students (g rades 3 to 5) at 10 school sites for bronchitis symptoms and asthma in relation to ambi ent pollutant levels to include NO, NO 2, and NO x measured at the school site. Mean levels ranged for schools from 33 to 69 ppb for NO x; 19 to 31 August 2007 3-112 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Figure 3.4-2.

NO x and NO 2 measurements at school sites away from traffic were similar to levels measured at the regiona l site. They found associations between traffic- related pollutants and asthma and bronchitis sympto ms, which is consistent with previous reports of traffic and respiratory outcomes. Some U.S. studies had previously shown inconsistent results, possibly due to exposure misclassification as th e studies used only a single fixed site. The higher effect estimates with black carbon, NO x, and NO compared with NO 2 and PM 2.5 suggest that primary or fresh tra ffic emissions may play an etiol ogic role in these relationships and that while NO x and NO may serve as indicators of tra ffic exposures, they may also act as etiologic agents themselves. Millstein et al. (2004) studied the effects of ambient air pollutants on asthma medication use and wheezing among 2,034 fourth-grade schoolch ildren from the CHS. Included in the pollutants examined were NO 2 and HNO 3. They observed that monthly average pollutant levels produced primarily by photochemistry (i.e., O 3, HNO 3, and acetic acid) were associated with asthma medication use among children with asth ma\u2014especially among children who spent more than the calculated median time outdoor s. The March-August OR for HNO 3 (IQR 1.64 ppb) was 1.62 (95% CI: 0.94, ppb) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.37). Other studies (see Annex Table AX6.2) have in vestigated asthma prevalence in children associated with NO 2 exposure. Although several of th ese studies have reported positive associations, the large number of comparisons ma de and the limited numb er of positive results do not suggest a strong rela tionship between chronic NO 2 exposure and asthma. Exposure in these studies varied, but medians were often grea ter than 20 ppb. Most of the studies did not report correlations of NO 2 exposure with other air pollutants; therefore, it is not possible to determine whether some of these associations were related to other air contaminants. Annex Table AX6.6-2 lists several studies from Europe where the In ternational Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) protoc ol was used. Children were interviewed in school and results of the questionnaire were compared with air pollution measurements in their communities. These studies included thousands of children in several European countries and Taiwan, and all but one were negative. In Austria (Studnicka, 1997) the highest level of exposure (14.7- to 17.0-ppb NO 2) was associated with increased risk of asthma. Two studies (Shima and Adachi, 2000; Kim et al., 2004a) reported pos itive associations for girls, but negative associations for boys. It is difficult to interpret thes e studies since the level August 2007 3-114 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 of exposure did not vary by gender. The children surveyed were 9 to 11 years old. In this age range, asthma is more common among girls, perhaps due to hormonal influences, while asthma is more common in boys at younger ages. 3.4.1.4 Respiratory Symptoms Although a large number of studies have inves tigated effects of ch ronic exposure to NO 2 on respiratory symptoms, the validity of these studies is uncertain. More appropriately, symptoms should be compared to acute exposures . In some of these studies, a symptom (e.g. wheeze) may be used as a surrogate for disease th at is difficult to define or diagnose, (e.g. asthma). This confusion between acute and ch ronic symptoms or acute and chronic exposure may explain some of the inconsistenc y in results of these studies. Annex Table AX6.6-3 lists nine studies, most of which report some positive associations with NO 2 exposure and symptoms, but all report a large number of negative results. Only one of these studies (Peters et al., 1999) reported an association of NO 2 exposure with wheeze, and in boys. This was despite the fact that wheeze was investigated in a larg e number of studies, including several studies that included thousands of children. McConnell et al. (2003) studied the relationship between bronchitis symptoms and pollutants in the CHS. Symptoms assessed yearly by questionnaire from 1996 to 1999 were associated with the yearly variability for the pollutants for NO 2 (OR = 1.071 ppb [95% CI: 1.02, 1.13). In two-pollutant models, the effects of yearly variation in NO 2 were only modestly reduced by adjusting for other pollutants except for OC and NO 2. (See Figure 3.4-3). McConnell et al. (2006) evaluated whether the association of exposur e to air pollution with annual prevalence of chronic cough, phleg m production, or bronchiti s was modified by dog or cat ownership indicators or allergen and endotoxin exposur e. Subjects consisted of 475 children from the CHS. Among childre n owning a dog, there was strong association between bronchitis symptoms and all pollutants studied. Odds ratio for NO 2 were 1.49 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.95), indicating that dog ownership may worsen the relationship betw een air pollution and respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children. Cough and difficulty breathing were more commonly reported in association with NO 2 exposure. Interestingly, both Garrett et al., 1999 and Hirsch et al., 1999 report positive associations between NO 2 exposure and symptoms when symptoms are less common.

Three studies (Mukala et al., 1999; van Stri en et al., 2004; Nitschke et al., 2006) compared exposure to NO 2 measured by personal monitors, or monitors in the home, with respiratory symptoms. Mukala et al. (1999) reported a significant association of the highest level of weekly NO 2 exposure and cough. Both cough and s hortness of breath were reported by van Strien et al. (2004) associated with measured home exposure to NO 2 among infants. This relationship appeared to be dos e dependent. Nitschke et al. (2006) reported difficulty breathing and chest tightness in asthmatic children that was associat ed with 10-ppb increases in NO 2 measured in school classrooms. Further discussion of these studies was provided earlier in Section 6.2. Two studies of infants were conducted in Ge rmany and the Netherlands using the same exposure protocol (Gehring et al ., 2002; Brauer et al., 2002). In Munich, 1,756 infants were enrolled and followed for 2 years. Outcomes of interest were asthma, br onchitis, and respiratory August 2007 3-116 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 symptoms including wheeze, cough, and nasal sympto ms. To determine exposure, 40 measuring sites were selected in Munic h, including sites along main road s, side streets and background sites. At each site, NO 2 was measured four times (once in ea ch season) for 14 days using Palmes tubes. Regression modeling was used to relate annual average pollutant concentrations to a set of predictor variables (i.e., tr affic density, heavy vehicle dens ity, household density, population density) obtained from GIS. The percentage of variability explained by the model (R2) was 0.62 for NO 2. Using geocoded birth addresses, values for the predictor vari ables were obtained for each child, and the model was used to assign an estimate of NO 2 exposure. At 1 year of age, an increase of 8.5 \u00b5g/m3 of NO 2 was associated with cough (OR = 1.40 [95% CI: 1.12, 1.75]) and dry cough at night (OR = 1.36 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.74]). NO 2 exposure was not associated with wheeze, bronchitis, or respiratory infections. Estimated PM 2.5 exposure was also associated with cough and dry cough at night, with nearly identical odds ratios. In the Netherlands (Brauer et al., 2002), the same protocol was used to estimate NO 2 exposure in a birth cohort of 3,730 infants. However, these study subjects lived in many different communities from rural areas to large citi es in northern, central and western parts of the Netherlands. Forty sites were selected to repr esent different exposures and measurements were taken as in the Gehring et al . (2002) study. In this study, ear, nose, and throat infections (OR = 1.16 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.34]) 1.00, 1.23]) were marginally significan t. The association of NO 2 of with dry cough at night could not be replicated, nor was NO 2 associated with asthma, wheeze, bronchitis, or eczema. In both of these studies, the 40 m onitoring sites set up to measure NO 2 also measured PM 2.5 with Harvard Impactors. Estimates of NO 2 and PM 2.5 were highly correlated in Braurer et al., correlation = 0.97). The correlation wa s not reported in Gehring et al.; however, the similarity of odds ratios for each pollutant suggests that the estimated exposures were also highly correlated. Thus, a major limitation of these studie s is the inability to di stinguish the effects of different pollutants. In a study of 3,946 Munich schoolchildren, Nicola i et al. (2003) asse ssed traffic exposure using two different methods. First, all street segments within 50 m of each child's home were identified and the average daily traffic counts were totaled. Second, a model was constructed based on measurement of NO 2 at 34 sites throughout the city using traffic counts and street characteristics (R2 = 0.77). The model was then used to estimate NO 2 exposure at each child's August 2007 3-117 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 home address. When traffic counts of # 50m were used as an exposure variable, a significant association was found with current asth ma (OR = 1.79 [95% CI: = = 1.62 [95% CI: 1.16, 2.27]). Similar results were found when modeled NO 2 exposure was substituted as the exposure variable (current asthma OR = 1.65 [95% CI: 0.94, 2.90], wheeze OR = 1.58 = 1.60 [95% CI: 1.14, 2.23]). Asthma, whee ze, and cough were also associated with estimated exposures to soot and benzene derived from models, suggesting that some component of traffic pollution is increasing risk of respiratory conditions in children, but making it difficult to determine whether NO 2 is the cause of these conditions. 3.4.1.5 Integration of Evidence on Long-Term NO 2 Exposure and Respiratory Illness and Lung Function Decrements There is strong evidence for the increased o ccurrence of respiratory illness in children associated with long-term exposures to NO 2. An earlier U.S. Envir onmental Protection Agency meta-analysis of indoor NO 2 studies supported an effect of estimated exposure to NO 2 on respiratory symptoms and disease in children ages 5 to 12. A si milar relationship was not seen with infants and younger children ages 0 to 2. Recent evidence from cohort studies from California, examining NO 2 exposure in children over an 8-year period, demonstrated deficits in lung function growth. Deficits in lung functi on growth is a known ri sk factor for chronic respiratory disease and possibly for premature mortality in la ter life stages. Lung growth continues from early development through ear ly adulthood, reaches a plateau, and then eventually declines w ith advancing age. Dockery and Br unekreef (1996) have hypothesized that the risk for chronic respiratory disease is associ ated with maximum lung si ze, the length of time the lung size has been at the plateau, and the rate of decline of l ung function. Therefore, exposures to NO 2 in childhood may reduce maximum lung size by limiting lung growth and subsequently increase the risk in ad ulthood for chronic respiratory disease. Animal toxicological studies provide biologi cal plausibility for the observed increased incidence of respiratory illness among children. A number of de fense system components such as AMs and the humoral and cell-mediated immune system have been demonstrated to be targets for inhaled NO 2. The animal studies described above show that NO 2 exposure impairs the host defense system, causing animals to be more suscep tible to respiratory in fections. Morphological changes are elicited in ciliated epithelial cells at NO 2 concentrations as low as 0.5 ppm for August 2007 3-118 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 7 months; however, early studies showed that muco ciliary clearance is not affected by exposures <5 ppm. A more recent study in guinea pigs sh owed a concentration-dependent decrease in ciliary activity at 3-ppm NO 2. A second line of defense in the lung, the AMs, are affected by NO 2 in a concentration- and species-dependent manner with both acute and chronic exposures. Mechanisms whereby NO 2 affects AM function include membrane lipid peroxidation, decreased ability to produce superoxide anion, inhibi tion of migration, and decreased pha gocytic activity. Decreases in bactericidal and phagocytic activities are likely re lated to increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections. More recent studies have conf irmed that AMs are a primary target for NO 2 at exposure levels <1 ppm. Humoral and cell-mediated immune systems co mprise a third line of defense that has been shown to be suppressed by NO 2 exposure. The use of animal infectivity studies provides key biological plausibility evidence for the effects of NO 2 on respiratory morbidity and mortality. For these studies, the animals are exposed to NO 2, followed by exposure to an aerosol containing the infectious agent. This body of work shows that NO 2 decreases intrapulmonary bactericidal activity in mice in a concentration-de pendent manner, with no concurrent changes to mucociliary clearance. Thus, strong evidence indicates that the redu ced efficacy of lung defense systems is an important mechanism for the observed increase in incidence and seve rity of respiratory infections. Overall, the NO 2 toxicological literature suggest s a linear concentration-response relationship that exists in an exposure range of 0.5 to >5 ppm and mortality resulting from pulmonary infection. NO 2 exposure reduces the efficiency of defense against infections at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppm. The exposure protocol is important, wi th concentration being more important than duration of exposure and wi th peak exposures being important in the overall response. The effect of concentration is stronge r with intermittent exposure than with continuous exposure. Repeated exposures of low levels of NO 2 are necessary for many respiratory effects. The animal toxicological studies also demonstr ate differences in species sensitivity to NO 2 and differences in responses to the microbes used for the infectivity tests. Animal to human extrapolation is limited by a poor understanding of the quantit ative relationship between NO 2 concentrations and effective doses between anim als and humans. However, animals and humans August 2007 3-119 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 share many host defense components, making the infectivity model usef ul for understanding the mechanisms whereby NO 2 elicits adverse respirat ory health effects. The 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen stated that an increase of reported respiratory symptoms in some epidemiology studies may be an indication of the abi lity of the respiratory host-defense mechanism to either overcome an infection or to limit its severity. NO 2 may affect the immune system in such a way that one or several aspects of the immune system do not function at a level sufficient to limit the extent or occurrence of infection. Toxicological and human clinical studies de monstrating altered host defenses provide plausibility for the observed increase in frequenc y and severity of respiratory symptoms and/or infections in humans. Increased severity or rate of respiratory illness may result from altered host defenses in an NO 2 exposed lung subsequently infected with an infectious microorganism. Although the host defense system reacts both very sp ecifically and generally to the challenge, the overall response in humans is expressed as a ge neralized demonstration of signs and symptoms that may be associated with a site such as the lower respiratory tract and also may be reported or objectively discerned as a general outcome such as a chest cold, cough, or an incident of asthma or bronchitis (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993). Other important biochemical mechanisms ex amined in animals may provide biological plausibility for chronic effects of NO 2 observed in epidemiology studies. The main biochemical targets of NO 2 exposure appear to be antioxidants, me mbrane polyunsaturated fatty acids, and thiol groups. NO 2 effects include changes in oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis and chemical alterations of lipids and proteins. Li pid peroxidation has been observed at NO 2 exposures as low as 0.04 ppm (for 9-months) and at exposures of 1.2 ppm for 1 week, suggesting lower effect thresholds with longer durations of exposure. Other studies show decreases in the formation of key arachidonic acid metabolites in AMs following NO 2 exposures of 0.5 ppm. NO 2 has also been shown to increase collagen synthesis rates at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppm. This could indicate increases in total lung collagen, which are associ ated with pulmonary fibrosis. Morphological effects following chronic NO 2 exposures have been identified in animal studies that link to these increases in co llagen synthesis and may provide pl ausibility for the deficits in lung function growth described in epidemiological studies.

Alterations in vagal responses have been shown to occur in rats exposed to 10-ppm NO 2 for 24 h; however, exposure to 0.4-ppm NO 2 for 4 weeks revealed no change (Tsubone and Suzuki, 1984). NO 2-induced effects on cardiac performance are sugge sted by a significant reduction in PaO 2 in rats exposed to 4.0-ppm NO 2 for 3 months. When exposure was decreased to 0.4-ppm NO 2 over the same exposure period, PaO 2 was not affected (Suzuki et al., 1981). In addition, a reduction in HR has been shown in mice exposed to both 1.2 and 4.0-ppm NO 2 for 1 month (Suz uki et al., 1984). Whether these effects are the direct result of NO 2 exposure or secondary responses to lung edema and changes in blood hemoglobin content is not known (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993). A more recent study (Takano et al., 2004) using an obese rat strain found changes in blood triglycerides, HDL, and HDL/tota l cholesterol ratios wi th a 24-week exposure to 0.16-ppm NO 2. No effect on hematocrit and hemoglobin have been reported in squirrel monkeys exposed to 1.0-ppm NO 2 for 16 months (Fenters et al., 1973) or in dogs exposed to #5.0-ppm NO 2 for 18 months (Wagner et al., 1965). There was, howe ver, polycythemia and an increased ratio of PMNs to lymphocytes in rats exposed to 2.0 + 1.0 ppm NO 2 for 14 months (Furiosi et al., 1973). No additional studies were found in the literatu re since the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen. 3.4.3 Adverse Birth Outcomes Associated with Long-Term NO 2 Exposure The effects of maternal exposure during preg nancy to air pollution have been examined by several investigators in recent years (2000 through 2006). The most common endpoints studied are low birth weight, pr eterm delivery, and measures of intrauterine growth (e.g., small for gestational age [SGA]). Generally, these stud ies have used routinely collected air pollution data and birth certificates from a given area for their analysis. The reliability and validity of birth cert ificate data has been recently reviewed (DiGiuseppe et al., 2002). The authors found that specific variab les had different degrees of reliability. Variables rated the most reliable included birth weight, ma ternal age, race, and insurance status. Gestational ag e, parity, and delivery type (v aginal versus cesarean) were reasonably reliable, while obstetrical complications and personal exposures, e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption, were not.

Similarly, mothers who have a normal infant are at low risk for an adverse outcome in the next pregnancy. St atistically, births to the same mother are not independent observations. As mo st women in the United States have two or more births and these births often occur within a few years, birth certificate data , which include several years of observations, have a very large number of non-inde pendent observations. None of the studies reviewed considered this problem, and all analyz ed births as independent events. For studies using only 1 (or at most 2) years of birth certif icates, the effects are small; for studies using several years of birth ce rtificates, the variance es timates would be reduced. While most studies analyzed average NO 2 exposure for the whole pregnancy, many also considered exposure during specific trimesters or other time periods. Fetal growth, for example, is much more variable during the third trimester. Thus, studies of feta l growth might anticipate that exposure during the third trim ester would have the greatest likel ihood of an association, as is true for the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy. However, growth can also be affected through placentation, which occurs in the first trimester. Sim ilarly, preterm delivery might be expected to be related to exposure early in pregnancy affecting placentation, or through acute effects occurring just before delivery. Of the three studies conducted in the Unite d States, one (Bell et al., 2007) reported a significant decrease in birthweight associated with exposure to NO 2 among mothers in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The two st udies conducted in Ca lifornia did not find associations between NO 2 exposure with any adverse birth outcome (Ritz et al., 2000; Salam et al., 2005). Differences in these studies that may have contributed to the differences in results include the following: sample size; average NO 2 concentration; and differe nt pollution mixtures. The results reported by Bell et al . (2007) had the largest sample size and therefore greater power to assess small increases in risk. The two Calif ornia studies reported high er mean concentrations of NO, but also strong correlations of NO 2 exposure with PM mass and CO. Annex Table AX6.5-1 lists seven studies that investigated the relationship of ambient NO 2 exposure with birth weight. Since low birth weight may result from either inadequate growth in utero or delivery before the usual 40 weeks of gestation, th ree of the authors only considered low birth weight (<2500 g) in full -term deliveries (>37 weeks), the other four controlled for gestational age in the analysis. When correlations with other pollutants were August 2007 3-122 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 reported in these studies, they ranged from 0.5 to 0.8. All of th ese studies reported strong effects for other pollutants. Lee et al. (2003) reported a si gnificant association between NO 2 and low birth weight, and the association was only for e xposure in the second trimester. It is difficult to hypothesize any biological mechanism relating NO 2 exposure and fetal growth specifically in the second trimester. Bell et al. (2007) reported an increased risk of low birth weight with NO 2 exposure averaged over pregnancy (OR = 1.027 [95% CI : 1.002, 1.051]) and a deficit in birthweight specific to the first trimester. In addition, the deficit in birthwei ght appeared to be greater among black mothers ( !12.7 g per IQR increase in NO 2 [95% CI: !18.0, !7.5]) than for white mothers (!8.3 increase in NO 2 [95% CI: !10.4, !6.3]). Six studies investigated NO 2 exposure related to pret erm delivery (Annex Table AX6.5.2). Three reported posit ive associations (Bobak, 2000; Maroziene et al., 2002; Leem et al., 2006) and three reported no as sociation (Liu et al., 2003; Ritz et al., 2000; Hansen et al., 2006). Among the studies reporting an asso ciation, two (Bobak, 2000; Leem et al., 2006) reported significant associations for both the first trimester and th e third trimester of pregnancy. The third (Maroziene et al., 2002) reported significant increases in risk for exposure in the first trimester and averaged over all of pregnancy. In two (Bobak, 2000; Leem et al., 2006) of the positive studies, NO 2 exposure was correlated with SO 2 exposure (r = 0.54, 0.61 for the two studies); the third study di d not report correlations. Three studies (see details in Annex Table AX6.5-3) specifical ly investigated fetal growth by comparing birth weight for gestational age with national standards. Two of these studies reported associations of small for gestational age with NO 2 exposure. Mannes et al. (2004) determined increased risk for exposure in trimesters 2 and 3, while Li u et al. (2003) reported risks associated only with NO 2 exposure in the first month of pregnancy. In all three studies, NO 2 exposure was correlated with CO expos ure (r = 0.69, 0.57, 0.72 in the three studies). Reproductive and Developmental Effects of NO 2 Exposure in Animal Studies Only a few studies have investigated the effects of NO 2 on reproduction and development of NO 2. Exposure to 1.0-ppm NO 2 for 7 h/day, 5 days/week for 21 days, resulted in no alterations in spermatogenesis, germinal cells, or interstitial cells of the testes of 6 rats (Kripke and Sherwin, 1984). Similarly, breeding studies by Shalamberidze and Tsereteli (1971) found August 2007 3-123 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 that long-term NO 2 exposure had no effect on fertility. However, there was a statistically significant decrease in litter size and neonatal weight when male and female rats exposed to 1.3-ppm NO 2, 12 h/day for 3 months were bred. In utero death due to NO 2 exposure resulted in smaller litter sizes, but no direct teratogenic effects were observed in the offspring. In fact, after several weeks, NO 2-exposed litters approached weight s similar to those of controls. Following inhalation exposure of pregnant Wistar rats to 0.5- and 5.3-ppm NO 2 for 6 h/day throughout gestation (21 days ), maternal toxic effects and developmental disturbances in the progeny were reported (Tabacova et al., 1984 ; Balabaeva and Tabacova, 1985; Tabacova and Balabaeva, 1988). Maternal weight gain during gestation was significantly reduced at 5.3 ppm, with findings of pathological changes, e.g., desquamative bronchi tis and bronchiolitis in the lung, mild parenchymal dystrophy and reduction of glycogen in the liver, and blood stasis and inflammatory reaction in the placenta. At gross examination, the placentas of the high-dose dams were smaller in size than those of control rats. A marked increase of lipid peroxides was found in maternal lungs and partic ularly in the placenta at bot h exposure levels by the end of gestation (Balabaeva and Tabacova, 1985). Distur bances in the prenatal development of the progeny were registered, such as 2- to 4-fold increase in late post-implantation lethality at 0.5 and 5.3 ppm, respectively, as well as reduced fetal we ight at term and stunt ed growth at 5.3 ppm. These effects were significantly related to the content of lipid peroxides in the placenta, which was suggestive of a pathogenetic role of placen tal damage. Teratogenic effects were not observed, but dose-dependent morphological signs of embryotoxicity and retarded intrauterine development, such as generalized edema, subcutaneous hematoma, retarded ossification, and skeletal aberrations, were found at both exposure levels. In a developmental neurotoxicity study, Wist ar rats were exposed by inhalation to 0-, 0.025-, 0.05-, 0.5-, or 5.3-ppm NO 2 during gestational days 0 thr ough 21. It is unclear whether the study was conducted at two separate times. Maternal toxicity was not reported. Viability and physical development (i.e., incisor eruption and eye opening) were significantly affected in the group exposed only to 5.3 ppm. There wa s a concentration-dependent change in neurobehavioral endpoints, including disturbances in early neuromotor development, including coordination deficits, retarded locomotor develo pment, and decreased ac tivity and reactivity. Statistical significance was observed in some or all of the endpoints at the time point(s) measured in the 0.05-, 0.5-, and 5.3-ppm exposure groups.

(1994) i nvestigated whether in uter o exposure of rats to NO 2 changed ultrasonic vocalization, a behavior al response indicator of the development of emotionality. Pregnant Wistar female ra ts were exposed by inhalati on to 0, 1.5-, and 3-ppm NO 2 from day 0 to 20 of gestation. Dam weight gain, pregnancy leng th, litter size at birth, number of dams giving birth, and postnatal mortal ity were unaffected by NO 2. There was a significant decrease in the duration of ultrasonic signa ls elicited by the removal of the pups from the nest in the 10-day and 15-day-old male pups in the 3-ppm NO 2-exposed group. No other parameters of ultrasonic emission, or of motor activity, we re significantly affected in th ese prenatally exposed pups. Since prenatal exposure to NO 2 did not significantly influence the rate of calling, the authors concluded that this decrease in the duration of ultrasounds in the 3-ppm NO 2 exposed group does not necessarily indicate altered emotionality, and the biological significance of these findings remains to be determined. 3.4.3.1 Integration and Biological Plausibility for Reproductive and Developmental Effects Integration of epidemiological and toxicological findings is limited by the dearth of studies in both disciplines. In epidemiologi cal studies of birth outcomes, generally, birth certificate data were compared to NO 2 measured by routine monitori ng. Only a small number of studies looked at low birth wei ght or preterm delivery. Of th e seven studies that examined associations between low birth weight and ambient NO 2, only two reported a significant association (Bell et al., 2007; L ee et al., 2003). Two studi es of fetal growth reported associations of small for gestational age with NO 2 exposure. Overall, exposure in the third trimester may have the strongest association with evaluating eff ects on fetal growth. In evaluations of preterm delivery, three studies reported positive associations and three studies reported no association. Exposure early and late in the pregnancy may be associated more strongly with effects on preterm delivery. These results are confounded by prior pregnancy history (i.e., multiple births to the same mother are not independent obs ervations), smoking, and poor quality of birth certificate data. The small body of toxicological litera ture examining the effects of NO 2 on birth outcomes is somewhat inconclusive, but NO 2 does not appear to be a reproductive toxicant. One early study found a decrease in litte r size and neonatal weight when male and female rats were exposed to 1.3 ppm for 3 months and then bred. Earlier studies suggest ed that exposures of August 2007 3-125 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 #10 ppm did not induce mutagenesis in rats. Th e few toxicological st udies discussed that evaluated the effects of NO 2 on reproduction and development show that NO 2 at ~5 ppm throughout gestation reduced mate rnal weight gain. A 5-ppm exposure resulted in smaller placentas, increased maternal lipid peroxides, increased late post-implantation mortality, embryotoxicity, and retarded intrauterine deve lopment. Gestational exposure to 3-ppm NO 2 caused a decrease in duration, but not rate , of ultrasonic vocalization in pups. In summary, epidemiological evidence is not strong for associations between NO 2 exposure and grown retardation; however, some evidence is accumulating for effects on preterm delivery. Similarly, scant animal evidence supports a weak association between NO 2 exposure and adverse birth outcomes and prov ides little mechanistic information or biological plausibility for the epidemiology findings. 3.4.4 Cancer Incidence A ssociated with Long-Term NO 2 Exposure Two studies (see Annex Table AX6.5-6) have investigated the relationship between NO 2 exposure and lung cancer and reported positive asso ciations. Although this literature review has concentrated on studies that measured exposure to NO 2, modeled exposures will be considered for cancer studies. This is neces sary because the relevant exposure period for lung cancer may be 30 years or more. Nyberg et al. (2000) reported results of a case control study of 1,043 men age 40 to 75 years with lung cancer and 2,364 controls in Stockholm County. They mapped residence addresses to a GIS database in dicating 4,300 traffic-related line sources and 500 point sources of NO 2 exposure. Exposure was derived from a model validated by comparison to actual measurements of NO 2 at six sites. Exposure to NO 2 at 10 \u00b5g/m3 was associated with an OR of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.23). Exposur e to the 90th percentile ( $29.26 \u00b5g/m3) of NO 2 was associated with an OR of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.99). Very similar results were reported in a Norwegian study (Nafstad et al., 2003). The study population is a cohort of 16,209 men who enrolled in a study of cardiovascular disease in 1972. The Norwegian cancer registry identified 422 inci dent cases of lung cancer. Exposure data was modeled based on residence, estimating exposure for each person in each year from 1974 to 1998. Each 10 \u00b5g/m 3 of NO 2 was associated with an OR of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.15). Cancer August 2007 3-126 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE incidence with exposure of $30 \u00b5g/m3 was associated with an OR of 1.36 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.83); however, controlling for SO 2 exposure did appreciably change the effect estimates for NO 2. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 What is particularly striking in these two studies is the similarity in the estimate of effect. Despite the fact that these two studies were c onducted by different invest igators, in different countries, using different study designs and different methods for modeling exposure, the odds ratios and confidence interv als for exposure per 10 \u00b5g/m 3 and above 30 \u00b5g/m3 are virtually identical. Animal and In Vitro Carcinogenicity and Genotoxicity Studies There is no clear evidence that NO 2 acts as a complete carcinogen. No studies were found on NO 2 using classical carcinogene sis whole-animal bioassays. Of the existing studies that have evaluated the carcinogen ic and cocarcinogenic potential of NO 2, results are often unclear or conflicting. Witschi et al. (1988) criti cally reviewed some of the important theoretical issues in interpreting th ese types of studies. NO 2 does appear to act as a tumor promoter at the site of contact (i.e., in the resp iratory tract from inhalation exposur e), possibly due to its ability to produce cellular damage and, thus, promote regene rative cell prolifera tion. This hypothesis is supported by observed hyperplasia of the lung epithelium from NO 2 exposure (see Lung Morphology section, U.S. Environmental Pr otection Agency, 1993), which is a common response to lung injury, and enhancement of endogenous retrovirus expression (Roy-Burman et al., 1982). However, these findings were considered by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1993) to be inconclusive. When studied using in vivo assays, no inductions of recessive lethal mutations were observed in Drosophila exposed to NO 2 (Inoue et al., 1981; Vict orin et al., 1990). NO 2 does not increase chromosomal aberrations in lymphocyt es and spermatocytes or micronuclei in bone marrow cells (Gooch et al., 1977; Victorin et al ., 1990). No increased stimulation of poly(ADP- ribose)synthetase activity (an indicator of DNA repair, suggesting possible DNA damage) was reported in AMs recovered from BAL of rats continuously ex posed to 1.2-ppm NO 2 for 3 days (Bermudez, 2001). NO 2 has been shown to be positive when tested for genotoxicity in in vitro assays (see Annex Table AX4.8). NO 2 is mutagenic in bacteria and in plants. In cell cult ures, three studies August 2007 3-127 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 showed chromosomal aberrations, SCE, and DNA single-strand breaks. Ho wever, a fourth study (Isomura et al., 1984) concl uded that NO, but not NO 2, was mutagenic in hamster cells. Coexposure Studies with NO 2 and Known Carcinogens Rats were injected with N-bis(2-hydroxy-propyl)nitrosam ine (BHPN) and continuously exposed to 0.04, 0.4, or 4.0-ppm NO 2 for 17 months. Although the da ta indicated five times as many lung adenomas or adenocarcinomas in the ra ts injected with BHPN and exposed to 4-ppm NO 2 (5/40 compared to 1/10), the re sults failed to achieve statistical significance (Ichinose et al., 1991). In a later study, Ichinose and Sagai (1992) reported in creased lung tumors in rats injected with BHPN, followed the next day by either clean air (0%), 0.05-ppm O 3 (8.3%), 0.05-ppm O3 + 0.4-ppm + 1 mg/m3 H2SO 4-aerosol (8.3%) for 13 months, and then maintained for another 11 months until study termination. Exposure to NO 2 was continuous, while the exposures to O 3 and H 2SO 4-aerosol were intermittent (exposure for 10 h/day). The increased lung tumo rs from combined exposure of O 3 and NO 2 were statistically significant. Ohyama et al. (1999) coexposed rats to diesel exhaust particulates (DEP) extract-coated carbon black particles (DEPcCBP) once a week for 4 weeks by intr atracheal instillation and to either 6-ppm NO 2, 4-ppm SO 2, or 6-ppm NO 2 + 4-ppm SO 2 16 h/day for 8 months, and thereafter exposed to clean air for 8 months. Alveolar adenomas were increased in animals exposed to DEPcCBP and either NO 2 and/or SO 2 compared to animals in the DEPcCBP-only group and to controls. The incidences of lung tumors for the NO 2, SO 2, and NO 2 and/or SO 2 groups were 6/24 (25%), 4/30 (13%), and 3/28 (11%), respectively. were observed in animals exposed to DEPcCBP alone or in the controls. Increased alveolar hyperplasia was elevated in all groups compar ed to controls. In addition, DNA adducts, as determined by 32P- postlabelling, was observed in the 2/3 animals exposed to both DEPcCBP and either NO 2 and/or SO 2, but not in animals exposed to DEPcCBP alone or controls. The authors concluded that the cellular damage induced by NO 2 and/or SO 2 may have resulted in increased cellular permeability of the DEPcCBP particles into the cells. Studies in Animals with Spontaneously High Tumor Rates Three studies evaluated tumor re sponse in strains with high tumor rates. The frequency and incidence of spontaneously occurring pulmonary adenomas was increased in strain A/J mice August 2007 3-128 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 (with spontaneously high tumor rate s) after exposure to 10.0-ppm NO 2 for 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 6 months (Adkins et al., 1986). These small, but statistically significant, increases were only detectable when the control response from nine groups (n = 400) were pooled. Exposure to 1.0- and 5.0-ppm NO 2 had no effect. In contrast, Rich ters and Damji (1990) found that an intermittent exposure to 0.25-ppm NO 2 for up to 26 weeks decreas ed the progression of a spontaneous T cell lymphoma in AKR/cum mice and increased surviv al rates. The investigators attribute this effect to an NO 2-induced decrease in the prolifer ation of T cell subpopulation in the spleen (especially T-helper/inducer CD+ lymphocytes), that produc e growth factors for the lymphoma. A study by Wagner et al. (1965) suggested that NO 2 may accelerate the production of tumors in CAF1/Jax mice (a strain that ha s spontaneously high pulmona ry tumor rates) after continuous exposure to 5.0-ppm NO 2. After 12 months of exposur e, 7/10 mice in the exposed group had tumors, compared to 4/10 in the contro ls. No differences in tumor production were observed after 14 and 16 months of exposure. A statistical evaluation of the data was not presented. Facilitation of Metastases Whether NO 2 facilitates metastases has been th e subject of several experiments by Richters and Kuraitis (1981, 1983), Richters and Richters (1983), and Richters et al. (1985). Mice were exposed to several con centrations and durations of NO 2 and were injected intravenously with a cultured-derived melanoma cell line (B16) after exposure, and subsequent tumors in the lung were counted. Although some of the experiments showed an increased number of lung tumors, statistica l methods were inappropriate. Furthermore, the experimental technique used in these studies probably did not evaluate metastas es formation, as the term is generally understood, but more correctly, colonization of the lung by tumor cells. Production of N-Nitroso Compound s and other Nitro Derivatives Because of evidence that NO 2 could produce NO 2! and NO 3! in the blood and the fact that NO 2! is known to react with amines to produ ce animal carcinogens (nitrosamines), the possibility that NO 2 could produce cancer via nitrosamine fo rmation has been investigated. Iqbal et al. (1980) were the first to demonstrate a linear time- and conc entration-dependent relationship between the amount of N-nitros omorpholine (NMOR, an animal carcinogen) found in whole- mouse homogenates after the mi ce were gavaged with 2 mg of morpholine (an exogenous amine August 2007 3-129 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 that is rapidly nitrosated) a nd exposure to 15.0- to 50.0-ppm NO 2 for between 1 and 4 h. In a follow-up study at more environmentally rele vant exposures, Iqbal et al. (1981) used dimethylamine (DMA), an amine that is slowly n itrosated to dimethylnitr osamine (DMN). reported a concentration-related incr ease in biosynthesis of DMN at NO 2 concentrations as low as 0.1 ppm; however, the rate was significantly greater at concentrations above 10.0-ppm NO 2. Increased length of exposure also increased DM N formation between 0.5 and 2 h, but synthesis of DMN was less after 3 or 4 h of exposure than after 0.5 h. Mirvish et al. (1981) concluded that the resu lts of Iqbal et al. (1980) were technically flawed, but they found that in vivo exposure to NO 2 could produce a nitr osating agent (NSA) that would nitrosate morpholine on ly when morpholine was added in vitro. Further experiments showed that the NSA was localized in the skin (Mirvish et al., 1983) and that mouse skin cholesterol was a likely NSA (Mirvi sh et al., 1986). It has also been reported that only very lipid-soluble amines, which can penetrate the skin, w ould be available to the NSA. Compounds such as morpholine, which are not li pid-soluble, could only react with NO 2 when painted directly on the skin (Mirvish et al., 1988). Iqbal ( 1984), responding to the Mi rvish et al. (1981) criticisms, verified their earlier (Iqbal et al., 1980) studies. The relative significance of NO 2! from NO 2 compared with other NO 2 sources such as food, tobacco, and NO 3!-reducing oral bacteria is uncertai n. Nitrosamines have not been detected in tissues of animals exposed by inhalation to NO 2 unless precursors to nitrosamines and/or inhibitors of nitrosamine metabolism are coadministered. Rubenchik et al. (1995) could not detect N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in tissues of mice exposed to 7.5 to 8.5 mg/m 3 NO 2 for 1 h. NDMA was found in tissues, however, if mice were simultaneously given oral doses of amidopyrine and 4-methylpyrazole, an inhibitor of NDMA metabolism. Nevertheless, the main source of NO 2! in the body is formed endogenously, and food is also a contributing source of nitrite (from nitrate conversion). 3.4.4.1 Integration and Biological Plausibility for Cancer Incidence In summary, two epidemiological studies c onducted in Europe showed an association between long-term NO 2 exposure and cancer incide nce, with OR at 10-\u00b5g/m3 NO 2, ranging from 1.10 to 1.08. Animal studies have provided no clear evidence that NO 2 acts as a carcinogen. The 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogendeemed fi ndings of hyperplasia of lung epithelium from August 2007 3-130 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 NO 2 exposure as inconclusive, though NO 2 does appear to act as a tumor promoter at the site of contact. There are no in vivo studies that suggest that NO 2 causes teratogenesis or malignant tumors. Only very high exposure studies, i.e., levels not relevant to ambient NO 2 levels, demonstrate increased chromosomal aberratio ns and mutations in in vitro studies. 3.4.5 Summary of Morbidity Effects Associated with Long-Term Exposure This section has presented epidemiological and toxicological studies evaluating decrements in lung function, asthma prevalen ce, respiratory sympto ms, and morphological damage associated with long-term NO 2 exposures. It has further presented limited evidence of cardiovascular effects, advers e birth outcomes, and cancer in cidence linked to long-term NO 2 exposure. Toxicological studies characterizing altered lung host defenses provide convincing biological plausibility for many of the respirat ory effects observed in epidemiological studies, especially the decrements in lung function obs erved in the cohort st udies. Epidemiology evidence is less clear for effects of long-term NO 2 exposure on adverse birth outcomes and cancer incidence. Animal studies do not pr ovide mechanistic information to support these observational findings. Some t oxicological studies have demo nstrated an effect of NO 2 exposure on cardiovascular endpoints; howev er, whether these effects are the direct result of NO 2 exposure or secondary responses to lung edema and changes in blood hemoglobin content are not known. Parallel findings have been reported in the epidemiologica l literature for short-term exposures only. 3.5 MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TER M EXPOSURE There have been several studies that examin ed mortality associations with long-term exposure to air pollution, including NO 2. They all used Cox-proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for poten tial confounders. The U.S. studies tended to focus on effects of PM, while the European studies tended to investig ate the influence of traf fic-related air pollution. 3.5.1 U.S. Studies on the Long-Term Exposure Effects on Mortality Dockery et al. (1993) conducted a prospectiv e cohort study to study the effects of air pollution with main focus on PM components in six U.S. cities, which were chosen based on the levels of air pollution (with Portage, WI being the least polluted and Steubenville, OH, the most August 2007 3-131 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 polluted). Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted with data from a 14-to-16-year mortality follow-up of 8,111 adults in the six cities, adjusting for smoking, sex, occupational exposures, etc. Fine particles were th e strongest predictor of mortality, but NO 2 was not analyzed in their study. Krewski et al. (2000) conducted sensitivity analysis of the Harvard Six Cities study and examined associations between gaseous pollutants (i.e., O 3, NO 2, SO 2, CO) and mortality. NO 2 showed risk estimates similar to those for PM 2.5 per \"low to high\" range increment with total (1.15 [95% CI: 1.27] 10-ppb in crease), cardiopulmonary [95% CI: 0.76, 1.57]) deaths; however, in this dataset NO 2 was highly correlated with PM 2.5 (r = 0.78), SO 42! (r = 0.78), and SO 2 (r = 0.84). Pope et al. (1995) examined PM effects on mo rtality using the American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort. Air pollution data from 151 U.S. metropolitan areas in 1980 were linked with individual risk factors on 552,138 a dults who resided in these areas when enrolled in the study in 1982. Mortality was followed up until 1989. As with the Harvard Six Cities Study, the main hypothesis of this study was focu sed on fine particles and SO 42!, and gaseous pollutants were not analyzed. Krewski et al. (2000) examined a ssociation between gase ous pollutants (means by season) and mortality in the Pope et al. (1995) st udy dataset. NO 2 showed weak but negative associations with total and cardi opulmonary deaths using either seasonal means. An extended study of the ACS cohort doubled the follow-up time (to 1998) and tripled the number of deaths compared to the original study (Pope et al., 2002). In addition to PM 2.5, all the gaseous pollutants were examined. SO 2 was associated with all the mortality outcomes (including all other cause of deaths), but NO 2 showed no associations with the mortality outcomes (RR = 1.00 [95% CI: 0.98, 1.02] per 10-ppb incr ease in NO 2). Miller et al. (2007) studied 65,893 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50 and 79 years without previous cardiovascular diseas e in 36 U.S. metropolitan areas from 1994 to 1998. They examined the association between on e or more fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events and the women's exposure to air pollutants. Subject's exposures to air pollution were estimated by assigning the annual mean levels of air pollutants in 2000 measured at the nearest monitor to the location of residence based on its five-digit ZIP Code centroid. Thus, the exposure estimate in this study is spatially more resolved than those in the Harvard Six Cities or the ACS cohort study. A total of 1,816 women had one or more fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events, including 261 deaths from cardiovascular causes. The main focus of the study was August 2007 3-132 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 PM 2.5, but the overall CVD events (but not resu lts for death events only) using all the copollutants (PM 10, PM 10-2.5, SO 2, NO 2, CO, and O 3) in both single- and multipollutant models were presented. The results for the data w ith non-missing exposure data were included (N = 28,402 subjects resulting in 879 CVD events) ar e described here. In the single-pollutant model results, PM 2.5 showed the strongest associations with the CVD events by far among the pollutants (hazard ratio = 1.24 [ 95% CI: 1.04, 1.48] per 10-\u00b5g/m3 increase in annual average), followed by SO 2 (HR = 1.07 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.20] per 5-ppb increase in the annual average). NO 2 did not show association with the overall CVD events (HR = 0.98 [95% CI: 0.89, 1.08] per 10-ppb increase in the annual average). In the multipollutant mode l (apparently, all the pollutants were included in the model), the PM 2.5's association with the overall CVD events was even stronger and the estimate larger (1.53 [95% CI: 1.21, 1.94]), and the association with SO 2 also became stronger and the estimate la rger (HR = 1.13 [95% CI: 0.98, 1.30]). NO 2 became negatively associated with the overall C VD events (HR = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.70, 0.95]). Correlations among these pollutants were not desc ribed, and therefore it is not possible to estimate the extent of confounding among these pollutants in these associations, but it is clear that PM 2.5 was the best predictor of the CVD events. Lipfert et al. (2000a) conducted an analysis of a national cohort of ~70,000 male U.S. military veterans who were diagnosed as hyperten sive in the mid 1970s and were followed up for about 21 years (up to 1996). This cohort was 35% black and 81% had been smokers at one time. TSP, PM 10, CO, O 3, NO 2, SO 2, SO 42!, PM 2.5, and coarse particles were considered. The county of residence at the time of entr y to the study was used to estima te exposures. Pollution levels were averaged by year and county. F our exposure periods (1960-74, 1975-81, 1982-88, and 1989-96) were defined, and deaths during each of the three most recent exposure periods were considered. Lipfert et al. noted that the pollution risk estimates were sensitive to the regression model specification, exposure period s, and the inclusion of ecologica l and individual variables. The authors reported that indications of c oncurrent mortality risks were found for NO 2 (the estimate was not given with confidence bands) and peak O 3. Their subsequent analysis (Lipfert et al., 2003) reported that the ai r pollution-mortality a ssociations were not sensitive to the adjustment for blood pressure. Li pfert et al. (2006a) also examin ed associations between traffic density and mortality in the same cohort, w hose follow-up period was extended to 2001. The county-level traffic density was de rived by dividing vehicle-km trav eled by the county land area. August 2007 3-133 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Because of the wide range of the traffic density variable, log-transformed traffic density was used in their analysis. They reported that traffi c density was a better pred ictor of mortality than ambient air pollution variables, with the possible exception of O 3. The log-transformed traffic density variable was moderately correlated with NO 2 (r = 0.48) and PM 2.5 (r = 0.50) in this data set. For the 1989 to 1996 data period (the pe riod that showed generally the strongest associations with exposure variables among the f our periods), the estimated mortality relative risk for NO 2 was 1.025 (95% CI: 0.983, 1.068) model. The two-pollutant model with the tr affic density variable reduced NO 2 risk estimates to 0.996 (95% CI: 0.954, 1.040). Interestingly, as the inves tigators pointed ou t, the risk estimates due to traffic density did not vary appr eciably across these four periods. They speculated that other environmental factors such as par ticles from tire, traffic noise, sp atial gradients in socioeconomic status, etc., might have been i nvolved. Lipfert et al. (2006b) fu rther extended analysis of the veteran's cohort data to include the U.S. Envi ronmental Protection Agency's Speciation Trends Network (STN) data, which collected chemical components of PM 2.5. They analyzed the STN data for year 2002, again using county-level averages . As in the previous Lipfert et al. (2006a) study, traffic density was the most important predictor of mortality, but a ssociations were also seen for elemental carbon, vanadium, NO 3!, and nickel. NO 2, O3, and PM 10 also showed positive but weaker associations. The risk estimate for NO 2 was 1.043 (95% CI: 0.967, 1.125) per 10-ppb increase in a single-pollutant model. Multi-pollutant model results were not presented for NO 2. Abbey et al. (1999) investigat ed associations between long-term ambient concentrations of PM 10, O3, NO 2, SO 2, and CO (1973 to 1992) and mortalit y (1977 to 1992) in a cohort of 6,338 nonsmoking California Seventh-day Adventists. Monthly indices of ambient air pollutant concentrations at 348 monitoring stations throughout Ca lifornia were interpol ated to zip code centroids according to home or work location histories of study participants, cumulated, and then averaged over time. They re ported associations between PM 10 and total mortality for males and non-malignant respiratory mort ality for both sexes. NO 2 was not associated with all-cause, cardiopulmonary, or respiratory mortality for either sex. Lung cancer mortality showed large risk estimates for most of the pollutants in eith er or both sexes, but the number of lung cancer deaths in this cohort was very small (12 for female and 18 for male) and therefore it is difficult to interpret these estimates. August 2007 3-134 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 The U.S. studies mentioned above have differences in study populat ion characteristics and geographic unit of averaging for pollution exposure estimates, and therefore the results cannot be directly compared. The ACS and Wo men's Health Initiative (WHI) cohort studies found no associations with NO 2, but in the veterans study, NO 2 was among the pollutants that showed associations with mortal ity, though traffic density showed the strongest association. The geographic resolution of air pollution exposure estimation varied across these studies: the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)-level averaging in the ACS study; county-level averaging in the veterans' study; and assi gning the nearest monitor's annual average to the ZIP code centroid. Traffic density and other pollutants that showed mortality associations in the veterans study, including elemental carbon, nickel, and vanadium and NO 2 (but not O 3 or NO 3!), are more localized pollutants, and therefore, using county- level aggregation, rather than MSA-level, may have resulted in smaller exposure misclassification. However, in the WHI cohort study, despite its finer resolution of exposure estimation, NO 2 (which is presumably more locally impacted than PM 2.5) was not associated with cardiovascular events . It should also be noted that there are generally fewer NO 2 monitors than PM 2.5 monitors in U.S. cities (nationwide, NO 2 has the smallest number of monitors among the Criteria pollutants except lead). Therefore, even when the spatial resolution for exposur e estimates is high in the study design, the fewer available monitors for NO 2 compared to other pollutants, may re sult in compromised exposure estimation for NO 2. Thus, there is uncertainty regarding how th e scale of aggregation affects the analyses that utilize cross-sectional comparisons. 3.5.2 European Studies on the Long- Term Exposure Effects on Mortality In contrast to the U.S. studies described above, the European studies described below, have more spatially resolved exposure esti mates, because their hypotheses or study aims involved mortality effects of tr affic-related air pollution. One study from France used a design similar to the Harvard Six Cities study or ACS in that it was not intended to study of traffic- related air pollution, and the exposure estima te was not done on an individual basis. Hoek et al. (2002) investigated a random sample of 5,000 subjects from the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer (NLCS) ages 55 to 69 from 1986 to 1994. Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (black smoke and NO 2) was estimated using 1986 home addresses. Exposure was estimated with the measured regional and urban background August 2007 3-135 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 concentration and an indicator variable for livi ng near major roads. Cardiopulmonary mortality was associated with living near a major road (RR = 1.95 [95% CI: 1.09, 3.52]) and less strongly with the estimated air pollution levels (e.g., for NO 2, RR = 1.32 [95% CI: 0.88, 1.98] per 10-ppb increase). The risk estimate for living near a major road was 1.41 (95% CI: 0.94, 2.12) for total mortality. For estimated NO 2 (incorporating both background and local impact), the RR was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.60, 2.23) per 10 ppb). Because the NO 2 exposure estimates were modeled, interpretation of their risk estimates is not st raightforward. However, these results do suggest that NO 2, as a marker of traffic-re lated air pollution, wa s associated with these mortality outcomes. Filleul et al. (2005) investig ated long-term effects of air pollution on mortality in 14,284 adults who resided in 24 areas from seven French cities when enrolled in the PAARC survey (for air pollution and chronic re spiratory diseases) in 1974. Daily measurements of SO 2, TSP, black smoke, NO 2, and NO were made in 24 areas for 3 years (1974 through 76). Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for smoking, educationa l level, BMI, and occupational exposure. Models were run before and after exclusion of six area monitors influenced by local traffic as determined by the NO/NO 2 ratio of >3. Before exclusion of the six areas, none of the air pollutants were associated with mortality outcomes. After exclusion of these areas, analyses showed associations between total mortality and TSP, black smoke, NO 2, and NO. The estimated NO 2 risks were 1.28 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.55) , 1.58 2.12 (95% CI: 1.11, 4.03) per 10-ppb increase in NO 2 mean over the study period for total, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mo rtality, respectively. From these results, the authors noted that inclusion of air monitoring data from stations directly in fluenced by local traffic could overestimate the mean population exposure and bias th e results. This point raises a concern for NO 2 exposure estimates used in other studies (e .g., ACS) in which the average of available monitors was used to represent the exposur e of each city's en tire population. Nafstad et al. (2004) investigated the association between morta lity and long-term air pollution exposure in a cohort of Norweg ian men followed from 1972/1973 through 1998. Nafstad et al. also presented the result for lung ca ncer deaths only in their earlier (Nafstad et al., 2003) analysis discussed in Section 3.3.4, but their 2004 study includes more mortality categories and is therefore descri bed here. Data from 16,209 men 40 to 49 years of age living in Oslo, Norway, in 1972 and 1973 were linked with da ta from the Norwegian Death Register and August 2007 3-136 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 with estimates of average yearly air pollution levels at the participants' home addresses from 1974 to 1998. PM was not considered in this study because measurement methods changed during the study period. NO x, rather than NO 2, was used. Exposure estimates for NO x and SO 2 were constructed using models based on subjec ts' addresses and emission data for industry, heating, and traffic and measured concentrations. Addresses linked to 50 of the busiest streets were given an additional exposur e based on estimates of annual average daily traffic. The adjusted risk estimate for total morta lity was 1.08 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.11] for a 10-\u00b5g/m3 increase in the estimated exposure to NO x. Corresponding mortality risk es timates for respiratory causes other than lung cancer was 1.16 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.26); for lung cancer, 1.11 (95% CI: 1.19); and for ischemic heart diseases, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.12). SO 2 did not show similar associations. The risk estimates presented for categorical levels of these pollutants showed mostly monotonic exposure-response relationships for NO x, but not for SO 2. The authors noted that the SO 2 levels were reduced by a factor of 7 during the study period, whereas NO x did not show any clear downward trends. These results are suggestive of th e effects of traffic-related air pollution on long-term mortality, but NO x likely represented the combined effects of that source, possibly including PM, which could not be analyzed in this study. Nyberg et al. (2000), a case- control study of 1,043 men aged 40 to 75 with lung cancer and 2,364 cont rols in Stockholm County, reported similar results to this study. They mapped residenc e addresses to a GIS database indicating 4,300 traffic-related line sources and 500 point sources of NO 2 exposure. Exposure was derived from a model validated by comparison to actual measurements of NO 2 at six sites. Exposure to NO 2 at 10 \u00b5g/m3 was associated with an OR of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.97 1.23). Exposure to the 90th percentile ( $29.26 \u00b5g/m3) of NO 2 was associated with an OR of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.99). Naess et al. (2007) investigat ed the concentration-respons e relationships between air pollution (i.e., NO 2, PM 10, PM 2.5) and cause-specific mortality usi ng all the inhabitants of Oslo, Norway, aged 51 to 90 years on January 1, 1992 (n = 143,842), with follow-up of deaths from 1992 to 1998. An air dispersion model was used to estimate the air pollution levels for 1992 through 1995 in all 470 administrative neighborhoods. Correlations among these pollutants were high (ranged 0.88 to 0.95), but they we re not correlated with educa tion and occupation (less than 0.05). All causes of deaths were associated with all indicators of air pollution for both sexes and both age groups. The investigat ors reported that the effects appeared to increase at NO 2 levels August 2007 3-137 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE higher than 40 \u00b5g/m3 (21 ppb) in the younger age (51 to 70 years) group and with a linear effect in the interval of 20 to 60 \u00b5g/m3 (10 to 31 ppb) for the older age group (see Figure 3.4-4). However, they also noted that a similar pattern was found for both PM 2.5 and PM 10. Thus, the apparent threshold effect was not unique to NO 2. NO 2 risk estimates for all-cause mortality were presented only in a figure. Associations betw een these pollutants and cardiovascular causes, lung cancer, and COPD were also found in both age groups and sexes. The effect estimates were particularly larger for COPD deaths. The findi ngs are generally consistent with those from Nafstad et al. (2003 and 2004) studies, in which a smaller number of male-only subjects were analyzed. Unlike the 2004 Nafstad study, the Na ess et al. study (2007) did not adjust for smoking or physical activities. While NO 2 effects were suggested, the high correlation among the PM indices and NO 2 or NO x makes it difficult to ascribe these associations to NO 2/NO x alone. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Figure 3.4-4.

(2006) investig ated the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution originating from traffic and industrial sources and total and cause-specific mortality in a cohort of women living in North Rhine-Westpha lia, Germany. The area includes the Ruhr region, one of Europe's larges t industrial areas. Approxima tely 4,800 women (age 50 to August 2007 3-138 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 59 years) were followed for vital status and migr ation. Exposure to air pollution was estimated by GIS models using the distance to major roads, NO 2, and PM 10 (estimated from 0.71 H TSP, based on available PM 10 and TSP data in the area) concentrations from air monitoring station data. Cardiopulmonary mortality was associated with living within a 50 -m radius of a major road (RR = 1.70 [95% CI: 1.02, 2.81]), NO 2 (RR = 1.72 [95% CI: 1.28, 2.29] per 10-ppb increase in annual average), and PM 10 (RR = 1.34 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.71] per 7-\u00b5g/m3 increase in annual average). Exposure to NO 2 was also associated with all-cause mortality (1.21 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.42] per 10 ppb). NO 2 was generally more strongly asso ciated with mort ality than the indicator for living near a major road (within versus beyond a 50-m radius) or PM 10. 3.5.3 Estimation of Exposure in Long-Term Exposure Mortality Studies The long-term exposure mortality studies desc ribed above can be categorized into two types based on the way exposure estimates were made: (1) studies in which the community average values were assigned to all the subjec ts in that community; (2) studies in which individual subject's exposure was estimated based on spatial modeling using emission and concentration data. The first type is what K unzli and Tager (1997) called \"semi-individual\" study in which the information on potential conf ounders are collected an d adjusted for on an individual basis, but the air pollution exposure estimate was done on an ecologic basis. The Harvard Six Cities study, the ACS study, and the French PAARC study are of this type. The studies that used the latter type of approach are mostly studies that attempted to investigate the effects of traffic-related pollu tants. In the Abbey et al. (1999) Seventh-day Adventist study, individual exposure estimates were made through interpolation of ambient monitors because a relatively large number of monitors (348) were available within California, but unlike the European studies, they did not attempt to addres s specifically the influence of traffic-related exposures. The Filleul et al. (2005) French seven citi es (24 areas) study found that associations between NO 2 and mortality outcomes were found only afte r exclusions of six area monitors that were highly influenced by local tr affic. This raises a question about potential exposure errors associated with NO 2 or NO x in the semi-individual studies. In order for the population average exposure estimate to be representative in a se mi-ecologic study, the data from locally impacted NO 2 monitors may cause exposure erro r or, at the least, monitor se lection criteria need to be August 2007 3-139 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 consistent across cities (even if those who live near the source are the ones who are adversely affected). It is not clear; to what extent such exposure error affected other semi-individual studies. Unlike regional air pollutants (e.g., SO 42! and PM 2.5) in the eastern United States in warm seasons when its major constituent is SO 42!) whose levels are generally uniform within the scale of the metropolitan area, the within-city variation for more locally impacted pollutants such as NO 2, SO 2, and CO are likely to be larger and, ther efore, are more likely to have larger exposure errors in the semi-indivi dual studies. The smaller numb er of monitors available for NO 2 in the United States may make the relative error worse for NO 2 compared to other pollutants. In the Krewski et al. (2000) sensitivity analysis of the Harvard Six Cities study, NO 2 was associated with total and cardiopulmonary deaths. However, NO 2 was highly correlated with PM 2.5, SO 42!, and SO 2 in this data set, and combined with the relatively small number of cities studied, it is difficult to interpret the risk es timates. In Krewski et al.'s sensitivity analysis of the 1995 ACS study, or in the Pope et al.'s (2002) extended ACS study, NO 2 was not associated with deaths. In the Hoek et al. study (2002) , the indicator of living near a major road was a better predictor of mortality than the estimated NO 2 exposures. In the Gehr ing et al. study (2006) of the North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the estimated NO 2 was a better predictor of total and cardiopulmonary mortality than the indicator of living near a majo r road. Comparing the results for the indicators of living near a majo r road (categorical) and the estimated NO 2 or NO x exposures (continuous) is not stra ightforward, but it is possible th at, depending on the presence of other combustion sources (e.g., the North Rh ine-Westphalia area incl uded highly industrial areas), NO 2 may represent more than traffic-related pollution. The second type of studies discussed above , which estimated individual exposures, may provide more accurate exposure estimates than the semi-individual studies. However, because they generally involve modeling with such in formation as traffic volume and other emission estimates in addition to monitored concentratio ns, additional uncertainties may be introduced. Thus, validity and comparability of various methods may need to be examined. In addition, because the review process, such as this, ultimately needs to link the relationship between the concentration measured at the community monitors and the health effects, interpreting the risk estimates based on individual-level exposures will require an additional step to translate the difference. In addition, the studies with estima ted individual exposures w ill need to deal with August 2007 3-140 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 within-city spatial confounding w ith socioeconomic conditions. While most of these studies adjusted for the socioeconomic variables, resi dual confounding is always a concern. Finally, a more accurate exposure estimate does not solve the problem of the surrogate role that NO 2 may play. Most of these studies do acknowl edge this issue and generally treat NO 2 as a surrogate marker, but the extent of such surrogacy a nd confounding with other tr affic- or combustion- related pollutant is not clear at this point. 3.5.4 Summary of Risk Estimates for Mortality with Long-Term Exposure Figure 3.4-5 summarizes the NO 2 risk estimates for total mortality from the studies reviewed above. The risk estimates are grouped to those that used ecologic-level exposure estimates and those that used individual exposur e estimates, but because of the small number of studies listed, no systematic patter n is apparent. Not all of thes e studies presented correlation between NO 2 and other pollutants, but those that did present some high correlation coefficients. For example, in the Harvard Six Cities study, the correlation between NO 2 and PM 2.5 was 0.78. In the French study, the correlation between NO 2 and black smoke was 0.72. In the German study, the correlation between NO 2 and PM 10 was 0.8 for the 5-year averages. Therefore, interpretation of the estimates requires additional caution. The risk estimates for total mortality ranged from 0 to 1.28 per 10-ppb increa se in annual or longer averages of NO 2. The risk estimates for more specific categories were often larger than these, but such associations were often not specific to NO 2, or not consistent across studies. In the long-term studies, those that did re port correlation among po llutants suggest that NO 2 was highly correlated with PM indices to the extent (r ~ 0.8) that results from multipollutant models would be meaningless. Available information on long-term mortality NO 2 risk estimates for more specific causes is also limited. Among the studies with larger number of subjects, th e ACS study (Pope et al., 2002) examined cardiopulmonary and lung cancer deat hs, but as with the al l-cause deaths, they were not associated with NO 2. In the Naess et al. (2007) anal ysis of all inhabitants of Oslo, Norway, age 51 to 90, NO 2 risk estimates for COPD were highe r than those for other causes, but the same pattern was seen for PM 2.5 and PM 10. In the Gehring et al . (2006) study in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, NO 2 risk estimates for cardiopulmonary mortality were larger than August 2007 3-141 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Figure 3.4-5.

Thus, higher risk estimates seen for specific causes of deaths were not specific to NO 2 in these studies. In long-term studies, different geographic sc ales were used to estimate air pollution exposure estimates across studies. Since the re lative strength of asso ciation with health outcomes among various air pollutant indices may be affected by the spatial distribution of the pollutants (i.e., regional versus local), the numbers of monitors available, and the scale of aggregation in the study design, it is not clear how these factors a ffected the apparent difference in results. 3.6 STUDIES OF NO, HONO, AND HNO 3 As discussed earlier in Ch apter 3, the family of NO x contains many other chemicals besides NO 2. Of these, chemicals of interest from a toxicology standpoint include nitric oxide (NO) and HNO 3. Most of the data is on NO, with many of the studies using high concentrations. Only the lower concentration studie s (i.e., studies that tested con centrations within an order or two of magnitude above environmental leve ls) have been include d in this update. Nitric Oxide (NO) Endogenous Formation of NO Compared with NO 2, the toxicity database on NO is small. A confounding factor with the toxicity studies on NO is th at it is often difficult to obtain pure NO in air without some contamination with NO 2. Endogenous NO is formed in cells from the amino acid L-arginine by at least three different oxygen-utilizing NO synthetases. Endogenous NO is involved in intracellular signaling in the nervous system, mediation of vasodilation in both systemic and pulmonary circulation, and mediation of cytotoxicity and host defense reac tions in the immune al., 1991, 1992; S nyder and Bredt, 1992). There are two basic actions of endogenous NO. It is involved in a variety of actions at lo w concentrations (pico- nanomolar) within nerve and endothelial cells via activation of guanylate cyclase (Ignarro, 1989). The other action of endogenous NO involves high concentrations (nano- to micromolar) and is formed during induction of enzymes triggered by exposure of cells to bacterial toxins or to August 2007 3-143 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 growth-regulating factors (cytokin ins). The inducible nitric oxide occurs especially in macrophages and neutrophil leukocytes and is important for the killing of bacteria and parasites and possibly also for cytost asis in antitumor reactions (Hibbs et al., 1988; Ignarro, 1989; Moncada et al., 1991, 1992). Effects of NO on Pulmonary Function, Morphology, and Host Lung Defense Function Murphy et al. (1964) found that respiratory function was not affected in guinea pigs exposed to NO at 19,600 \u00b5g/m 3 (16 ppm) or 61,300 \u00b5g/m3 (50 ppm) for 4 h. Guinea pigs exposed to 6130-\u00b5g/m3 (5 ppm) NO for 30 min, twice a w eek for 7 weeks showed increased airways responsiveness to acetylcholine. Reve rsal of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction by NO has been reported in guinea pigs at 6130 \u00b5g/m3 (5 ppm) (Dupuy et al., 1992), while in rabbits, full reversal of methacholine-induc ed bronchoconstriction was seen at 98,100 \u00b5g/m3 (80 ppm) (H\u00f6gman et al., 1993). Th is action is in contrast to NO 2 as described above, which sensitizes the lung to bronchoconstriction fo llowing irritant and allergen challenge. Holt et al. (1979) found grossly emphysematous lungs in NO-exposed mice, whereas comparable exposures to NO 2 resulted in only airspace enlargement. In the study by Azoulay et al. (1981), rats expose d continuously to 3760-\u00b5g/m3 (2 ppm) NO for 6-h to 6 weeks were found to have significant enlargement of the ai rspaces and destruction of alveolar septa. Results from a recent study (Mercer et al. ( 1995) suggest that the pattern of injury produced by NO may differ from NO 2, as well as being more pot ent in introducing certain changes in lung morphology. In this study, male rats were exposed to either NO or NO 2 at 0.5 ppm with twice daily 1-h spik es of 1.5 ppm for 9 weeks. Th e number of pores of Kohn and detached alveolar septa were evaluated by electron microscopy, us ing stereological procedures for the study of lung structure that involved morphometric anal yses of electron micrographs. The average number of pores per lung for the NO group exceeded by approximately 2.5 times the mean number for the NO 2 groups, which was more than 10 times that for controls. The mean number of detached septa per lung was significan tly higher for the NO group (mean 117) than the NO 2 group (mean 20) or the controls (mean 4). There was also a statistically significant 30% reduction in intersti tial cells in the NO group, but no sign ificant differences in the other parenchymal cell types were observed be tween the controls and the NO- or NO 2-exposed groups. Lastly, the thickness of the interstitial sp ace was reduced for the NO group (mean 0.24 \u00b5m August 2007 3-144 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 versus 0.32 \u00b5m for controls) but not for the NO 2 group (mean 0.29 \u00b5m), and epithelial cell thickness did not differ between the groups. In a subsequent study, Mercer et al. (1999) exposed rats continuously 22 h/day to 0, 2454, or 7362-\u00b5g/m3 (0, 2, or 6 ppm) NO for 6 weeks. The surface density of the alveolar basement membrane and the average thickness of the type II alveolar epithelium, although reduced, did not differ statistically from control an imals. Morphometric analysis showed that a significant greater fraction of the alveolar surface was covered by type II cells in the lungs from both NO exposure groups. There was a 52% increase in the number of t ype II cells per surface area of basement memb rane in the 7362-\u00b5g/m 3 (6 ppm) NO-exposed animals, as well as an approximate 3-fold increase in the number of AMs in the airspaces of rat lungs. The mean number of AMs in the airspaces of lungs from the 2454-\u00b5g/m3 (2 ppm) NO-exposed animals was elevated but not statistically different from controls. Inhaled NO produced significant sequestration of platelets in the pulmonary capi llaries, as determined fr om transmission electron micrographs. The volume density of platelets in the pulmonary capillaries was increased approximately 2-fold in the NO-exposed groups . Although present in higher numbers, the platelets did not demonstrate morphologic features of activation such as large, irregular profiles. Under scanning electron microscopy, fenestrae we re found to be distri buted throughout the gas- exchange region of the lungs. Unlike the resu lts of Mercer et al. (1995), there were no statistically significant differe nces in the number of lung fenestrae between control and NO- exposed lungs, as determined by both serial -section counts and scanni ng electron microscopy. Thus, it appears that inhaled NO produces a pa ttern of injury similar to that of NO 2, at least in this regard. Two studies reported the effects of NO on host defense function of the lungs. Mice exposed to 12,270-\u00b5g/m3 (10 ppm) NO for 2 h/day, 5 days/week for 30 weeks (Holt et al., 1979) developed immunological alterations that are difficult to interpret due to the duration dependence of some of the responses (e.g., an enhancement of the humoral immune response to sheep red blood cells was seen at 10 weeks, but this was not evident at the end of the exposure series). In the study by Azoulay et al. (1981), mice exposed continuously to 3760-\u00b5g/m3 (2.0 ppm) NO for 6-h to 4 weeks did not show any effect on resist ance to infection induced by a bacterial aerosol administered after each NO exposure. Although the data are limited, NO does not appear to have the same effect on parameters re lated to host immune defense as NO 2. August 2007 3-145 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Metabolic Effects in the Lung and Other Tissues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 NO has a higher affinity for heme-bound iron than does CO. This affinity leads to the formation of methemoglobin and the stimulation of guanylate cyclase. NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in vitro, resulting in vasodilation (Katsuki et al., 1977; Ignarro, 1989; Moncada ). This activation pathway vi a guanylate cyclase is probably involved in the vasodilation observed in the pu lmonary circulation and the acute bronchodilator effect from inhaled NO. The initial pulmonary vasodilation that occu rs during NO inhalation does not appear to be maintained chronically. Pulmonary cGMP, iNOS, mRNA, and TNF- were increased in the lungs of rats after a 1-h exposure to 7362-\u00b5g/m 3 (6 ppm) NO, but decreased to control valu es after 1-day and 1-week exposure periods (Brady et. al., 1998). Lipid peroxidation (measured as malonyl dialde hyde) was decreased at all time points. It is unclear whether other effects might be exerted from ambient NO via the pathway involving guanylate cyclase. Since NO is rapidly inactivated by hemoglobin, internal organs other than the lungs are unlikely to be affected directly by cGMP -mediated vasodilator influence from ambient concentrations of NO. Methemoglobin formation from inhaled NO, via the formation of nitrosylhemoglobin (Oda et al., 1975, 1979, 1980a,b; Case et al., 197 9; Nakajima et al., 1980) and subsequent oxidation with oxygen, has been well-characterized (Kon et al., 1977; Chiodi and Mohler, 1985). Levels of reduced glutathione in the lung are not changed in mice exposed to NO concentrations of 12,300 to 25,800 \u00b5g/m 3 (10 to 21 ppm) for 3-h daily for 7 days (Watanabe et al., 1980). The cytotoxic effects of NO may be explaine d by the possible mechanism of NO reacting with thiol-associated iron in enzymes and ev entually displacing the iron (Hibbs et al., 1988; Weinberg, 1992). Other effects of NO with iron and various enzymes and nucleic acids are listed in Annex AX4.6. Effects of Short-Term NO Exposure Research on the role of endogenous NO as a me diator of vascular t one continues to be active. NO inhalation is used in clinical se ttings or therapeutically to treat pulmonary hypertension due to its effects on va scular tone in the pulmonary vasc ular bed. It is possible that NO 2 could influence airways or pulmonary vascular availability of NO, with consequences for the regulation of pulmonary vascular function. Ponka and Virtenen (1996) report an association August 2007 3-146 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 of hospital and ED admissions with NO. Other studies summarized below were experimental in design. The effects of inhaled NO are limited to the pulmonary vasculature presumably due to rapid removal of NO from the circulation aris ing from reactions with hemoglobin. Although many studies have used concentrations that are not relevant to environmental levels of air pollution and were not designed to evaluate th e effects of ambient exposures, changes in pulmonary vascular resistance do occur at con centrations as low as 10 ppm following acute exposure in pigs (Alving et al., 1993; Holopain en et al., 1999) and 5 ppm in sheep (Fratacci et al., 1991; Ichinose et al., 1995; DeMarco, et al., 1996). In addition, Jiang et al (2002) reported in a rodent model of chronic pulmonary hypertension that showed that inhaled NO concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 ppm reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure, while no such changes were observed in control rats (i.e., normal hypertensive). Thus, changes in vascular tone from inhaled NO occur in the 5-ppm range, although effects may also be present at lower concentrations in sensitized animals. Formation of methemoglobin, via the formati on of nitrosylhemoglobin (Oda et al., 1975, 1979, 1980a,b; Case et al., 1979; Na kajima et al., 1980) and subs equent oxidation with oxygen has been well-described (Kon et al., 1977; Chio di and Mohler, 1985). Methemoglobin in mice increased exponentially with the NO concentration, from 24,500 to 98,100 \u00b5g/m 3 (20 to 80 ppm); levels rapidly decreased after cessation of exposure, with a half-time of only a few minutes (Oda et al.,1980b). Exposure of mice to 2940-\u00b5g/m 3 (2.4 ppm) NO for 23 to 29 months resulted in nitrosylhemoglobin levels at 0.01%, while the maximal methemoglobin level was 0.3% (Oda et al., 1980b). Exposure to 12,300-\u00b5g/m3 (10 ppm) NO 2 for 6.5 months resulted in nitrosylhemoglobin level of 0.13% and methemogl obin level of 0.2% (Oda et al., 1976). Rats exposed to 2450 \u00b5g/m3 (2 ppm) continuously for 6 weeks showed no detectable methemoglobin (Azoulay et al., 1977). In humans , the ability to reduce methemogl obin varies genetically and is lower in infants, complicating direct extrapolat ion of effect levels to human health risk assessment. The ability of NO to react with iron-containing enzymes has additional ramifications beyond methemoglobin.

A s light increase in hemolysis was seen in mice exposed to 2940 \u00b5g/m 3 (2.4 ppm) of NO (Oda et al., 1980a). Nitrous Acid (HONO) Two indoor nitrous acid studies were identi fied that examine health effects and HONO exposure. One of these was van Strien et al. (20 04) discussed above, and the other is Jarvis et al. (2006). In England, Jarvis et al . (2005) studied 276 adults and related respiratory symptoms and lung function to home levels of NO 2 and HONO as well as outdoor NO 2 levels. The median indoor HONO level was 3.10 ppb (IQR 2.05 to 5.09) and 12.76 ppb for NO 2 indoors and 13.83-ppb NO 2 outdoors. The prevalence of wheeze was hi gher in individuals in the highest quartile HONO concentration where 33.3% reported wheeze in the previous 12 months versus those in the lowest concentr ation quartile where 25.5% repor ted wheeze. No significant relationships for NO 2 were noted. An increase in 1 ppb in indoor HONO was associated with a decrease in FEV 1, percentages predicted (-0.96% [95% CI: !1.82, !0.09). After adjustment for NO 2 measures, the association of HONO with low lung function persisted. In the van Strien et al. (2004) study of infant s in the United States, NO 2 and HONO were moderately correlated (r = 0.40) with higher correlations in homes during autumn and wi nter (r = 0.83). The highest nitrous acid level was 4.2 ppb. Nitrous acid expo sure was not independently associated with respiratory symptoms. There have also been controlled human expos ure studies evaluating the effects of nitrous acid. Beckett et al. (1995) exposed 11 m ild asthmatics to air or 0.65 ppm HONO for 3 h, including three 20-min exercise periods. Spirom etry and symptoms were measured during and immediately following exposure. HONO caused a small increase in irritant respiratory symptoms, and a 3% decline in FVC, relative to air exposure. FEV 1 was not significantly affected. Rasmussen et al. (1995) exposed 15 healthy nonsmokers to air, 0.077, and 0.395-ppm HONO for 3.5-h single 10-min exerci se period. HONO caused concentration-related increases in epithelial cells in eye tear fluid, suggesting eye conjunctival irritation. Specific airways conductance (the i nverse of airways resistance ) decreased 10% after HONO and 2% after air. There were no significant effects on FEV 1 or airways responsiveness.

Significant associations were re ported for long-term exposure to acid vapor with decrements in measures of lung function, though similar associations were reported with NO 2 and measures of PM (Gauderman et al., 2004). Very few toxicological studies have been conducted with HNO 3, even though it exists in ambient air generally as a water-soluble vapor. The few studies available have examined the histological response to instilled HNO 3 (usually 1%). This procedure was used to develop models of bronchiolitis obliteran s in various animal species, in cluding dogs, rabbits, and rats (Totten and Moran, 1961; Greenbe rg et al., 1971; Gardiner a nd Schanker, 1976; Mink et al., 1984). The World Health Organization (WHO, 1997) considered these studies to be informative for the design of inhalation studies but of que stionable relevancy to understanding the pulmonary response to pure HNO 3 vapor. Based on the limited data available, HNO 3 appears to affect some respiratory tract parameters in a fashion that is qualitatively similar to NO 2. In a study by Abraham et al. (1982), normal sheep and allergic sheep (i.e., having airways responses similar to those occurring in humans w ith allergic airways disease) were exposed to 4120-\u00b5g/m3 (1.6 ppm) HNO 3 vapor for 4-h using a \"head-only\" chamber. There was decreased specific pulmonary flow resistance in both groups of sheep, indicati ng no bronchoconstriction. The allergic, but not the normal, sheep showed increased airways reactivity to carbachol, both immediately and 24-h after HNO 3 exposure. Exposure of rabbits to HNO 3 concentrations of 50, 150, or 450 \u00b5g/m3 (0.02, 0.06, or 0.17 ppm), 4 h/day, 3 days /week for 4 weeks caused no overt pathology in conducting airways, and airways epithelium was normal in all exposure groups (Schlesinger et al., 1994). Stimulated s uperoxide production, howev er, was reduced in pulmonary macrophages at all exposure levels. Nadziejko et al. (1992) exposed rats to HNO 3 vapor for either a single 4- h exposure period to 1000-\u00b5g/m3 (0.39 ppm) HNO 3 vapor or 4 h/day for 4 days to 250-\u00b5g/m3 (0.1 ppm) HNO 3 vapor. There were no cha nges in cell populations in the BAL fluid from rats under either exposure condition. HNO 3 vapor, under either exposure condition, did not affect zymosan-stimulated respiratory burst activity when pulmonary macrophages were cultured overnight in order to prevent spontaneous respiratory burst activity.

Lavage fluid protein content was not affected, but lavage fluid elastase inhibitor capacity was increased in both exposure groups. It is not known whether this increase was caused by enhanced production of an elastase inhibitor within the lung or due to increased permeability and leakage of elastase inhibitor from the plasma into the lung lining layer. Sindhu et al. (1998) reported no effects on lung polyamine metabolism in rats exposed to 50-\u00b5g/m 3 (0.02 ppm) HNO 3 4 h/day, 3 days/week for 40 weeks. No other endpoints were evaluated.

Many other factors such as gender, nutritional status, smoking, and geneti c variability also may contribu te to the differential effects of environmental pollutants, including NO x. The reasons for paying special attention to these groups were that (1) they may be affected by lower levels of NO 2 than the general populations or that (2) the impact of an effect may be greater for these groups. Finally, epidem iological studies reviewed in the previous AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen iden tified children aged 5 to 12 y ears as a potentially susceptible subpopulation for increases in NO 2 respiratory morbidity. In the current document, we will focus on the susceptibility of subpopulations with preexisting asthma and cardiovascular disease, age -related susceptibility and vulnerability, high- exposure occupational groups, and genetic factors. 4.1.1 Preexisting Disease as a Potential Risk Factor A recent report of the National Research Counc il (NRC) emphasized the need to evaluate the effect of air pollution on susceptible groups including those with re spiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (NRC, 2004). Gene rally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), conduction disorders, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, and myocardial infarction (MI) are conditions believed to put persons at greater risk of a dverse events associated with air pollution. In addition, epidemiological evidence indicates that persons with bronchial hyperresponsivness (BHR) as determ ined by methacholine provocation may be at greater risk of symptoms, such as phlegm and lower respiratory symptoms, than subjects without BHR (Boezen et al., 1998). Several researcher s have investigated the effect of air pollution among potentially sensitive groups with preexist ing medical conditions. Asthmatic s are known to be one of the most NO 2-responsive subgroups in the population; the ev idence related to asthmatics is discussed in further detail below. August 2007 4-1 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE Asthmatics 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Airways hyperresponsiveness in asthmatics to both nonspecific chemical and physical stimuli and to specific allergens appears to be the most sensitive indicator of response to NO 2. Responsiveness is determined using a challenge agent, which causes an abnormal degree of constriction of the airways as a result of smooth muscle contract ion. This response ranges from mild to severe (spanning orders of magnit ude) and is often accompanied by production of sputum, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, an d chest tightness. Though some asthmatics do not have this bronchoconstrictor response and some nonasthmatic individuals do (Pattenmore et al., 1990), increased airways responsivene ss is correlated with asthma symptoms and increased asthma medication usage. Clinic al studies have repor ted increased airways responsiveness to a llergen challenge in asthmatic s following exposure to 0.26-ppm NO 2 for 30 min during rest (Barck et al ., 2002; Strand et al., 1996, 1998). Epidemiological studies have re ported associations with a ra nge of health outcomes with both short-term and long-term NO 2 exposure in asthmatics; Table 4.1 highlights some of the findings for asthmatics discussed in Chapter 3. The results reported in these studies generally report a positive excess risk for asthmatics associated with NO 2. The recent evidence strengthens conclusions drawn in the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen that asthmatics are likely more susceptible to effects from NO 2 exposures than the general public. Persons with Cardiovascular Diseases Epidemiological studies consistently have de monstrated an association between ambient levels of air pollutants and daily hospital admissions, and CVD emergency department (ED) visits. Recent epidemiological studies also have shown that persons with preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions are at increased risk for adverse cardi ac health events associated with ambient NO 2 concentrations (Peel et al., 2006; Mann et al., 2002; D'Ippoliti et al., 2003; von Klot et al., 2005). Peel et al. (2006) reported evidence of effect modification by co-morbid hypertension and diabetes for the association of ED visits for arrhythmia associated with NO x exposure. In another study, a statistically si gnificant positive relati onship was found between NO 2 concentrations and hospitalizations for ischem ic heart disease (IHD) among those with prior diagnoses of CHF and arrhythmia (Mann et al., 2002). The authors speculated, however that the vulnerability of the secondary CHF group may be due to differential diagnoses in this group (Mann et al., 2002).

Though there is limited evidence from clinical or toxicol ogical studies on potential suscepti bility in those with CVDs, the epidemiological evidence suggests that these indi viduals may be more sensitive to effects of NO 2 exposure. 4.1.2 Age-Related Variations in Susceptibility/Vulnerability Children and elders often ar e both considered at increa se risks from air pollution, compared to the general population. The American Academy of Pediatrics (2004) notes that children and infants are among the most suscep tible to many air pollutants, including NO 2. Eighty percent of alveoli are formed postnata lly and changes in the lung continue through adolescence; the developing lung is highly susceptible to damage from exposure to environmental toxicants (Dietert et al., 2000). Ch ildren also have increased vulnerability as they spend more time outdoors, are highly active, and have high minute ventilation, which collectively increase th eir dose (Plunkett et al., 1992; Wile y et al., 1991a,b). In addition to children, the elderly are frequently classified as being particularly susceptible to air pollution. The basis of the increased sensitivity in the elderly is not known, but one hypothesis is that it may be related to changes in th e respiratory tract lini ng fluid antioxidant defense network (Kelly et al., 2003). Also, the generally declining health status of many elders may increase their risks to air pollution induced effects. While evidence is limited for age-specific associations between NO 2 and acute respiratory ED visits, there is stronger evidence of the association between ambient NO 2 concentrations and hospital admissions for childre n and older adults. Peel et al. (2005) and Atkinson et al. (1999b) each found that the percent increase in ED visits for asthma among children was twice that found for s ubjects of all ages. Specificall y, Peel et al. (2005) found that asthma ED visits among children (2 to 18 year s) increased by 2.7% in response to a 20-ppb increase in the 1-h maximum NO 2 concentration, while the increase for all ages was 1.4%. Similarly, Atkinson et al. (1999b) reported an 8. 97% increase in ED visits for asthma among children aged 0 to 14 years associated w ith a 36-ppb increase in the 1-h maximum NO 2 concentration, while the increase for adults aged 15 to 64 and all ages together were 4.44% and 4.37%, respectively. Two additional studies (Sunye r et al., 1997; Migliare tti et al., 2005) found no difference in the rates of ED visits associated with NO 2 concentrations for children <15 years August 2007 4-3 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 and adults aged 15 to 64 years. Migliaretti et al. (2005) found that a 5.2-ppb increase in NO 2 was associated with a 7.7% increase in ED visits for asthma for participants over 64 years of age, while the same increment was associated with a 2.4% increase among partic ipants of all ages. Atkinson et al. (1999b) ev aluated the effect of a 36-ppb increase in NO 2 on ED visits for all respiratory causes and found percent increases to be higher among children (1 to 14 years, 2.17%) and the elderly ( $65 years, 3.65%) compared to adults aged 15 to 64 (1.87%). A number of studies investigated the association between ambient NO 2 levels and hospital admissions for all respiratory causes stratified by age group (Luginaah et al., 2005; Schouten et al., 1996; Ponce de Leon et al., 1996 ; Atkinson et al., 1999a; Prescott et al., 1998; Fusco et al., 2001; Braga et al., 2001; Wong et al., 1999). Of the six studies that evaluated the elderly population, four found that the percent increase in hospital admissions for all respiratory causes associated with ambient NO 2 concentrations was higher for the elderly age group ($65 years) compared with the adult age group (Schouten et al., 1996; Ponce de Leon et al., 1996; Atkinson et al., 1999a; Presco tt et al., 1998). Luginaah et al. (2005) and Wong et al. (1999) found no statistically signifi cant difference in the elderl y and adult age groups. Braga et al. (2001) only included subjects aged 0 to 19 years, but further stratified to find the largest percent increase in hospital admissions associated with NO 2 concentrations in the 0 to 2 age group (9.4%). Fusco et al. ( 2001) reported a larger increase in hospital admissions for all respiratory diseases among children compared with subjects of all ages (4.0% and 2.5%, respectively). The difference persisted when hos pital admissions were limited to asthma only. Likewise, Fusco et al. (2001) reported a larger increase in hospital ad mission for asthma among children compared with subjects of all ages ( 10.7% and 4.6%, respectively). Hinwood et al. (2006), Atkinson et al. (1999a), a nd Anderson et al. (1998) also f ound larger increases in hospital admissions for asthma among children (0 to 14 years) and the elderly ( $65 years) compared to subjects of all ages, though the increases repo rted in these studies were more modest in magnitude than that reported by Fusco et al. (2001). In elderly populations, associations between NO 2 and hospitalizations or ED visits for CVD, including stroke, have been observed in several multicity studies (Barnett et al., 2006; Simpson et al., 2005; Wellenius et al., 2005; Morris et al., 1995). However, some results were inconsistent across cities (Morri s et al., 1995), and investigators c ould not distinguish the effect of NO 2 from the effect of other tra ffic-related pollutants such as CO and particulate matter (PM).

The consequence of this hemoglobin reduc tion in individuals with significant underlying lung disease, heart disease, or anemia has not be en evaluated, but the reductions could lead to adverse cardiovascular consequences. Many field studies focused on the effect of NO 2 on the respiratory health of children, while fewer field studies compared the effect of NO 2 in adults and other ag e groups. In general, children and adults experienced decrements in l ung function associated with short-term ambient NO 2 exposures (see Section 3.2.1.2 for more details). Importantly, a number of long-term exposures studies suggest effects in childre n - impaired lung func tion growth, increased respiratory symptoms and infections, and onset of asthma (see Table 4.1 and Section 3.4.1.1). Several mortality studies have investigated age-related differences in NO 2 effects. Among the studies that observed positive associat ions between NO 2 and mortality, a comparison of all age or #64 years of age NO 2-mortality risk estimates to that of the $65 years of age indicates that, in general, the elderl y population is more susceptible to NO 2 effects (Biggeri et al., 2005; Burnett et al., 2004). One study (Simpson et al., 2005) found no difference in increases in CVD mortality associated with NO 2 concentrations between all ages and those participants $65 years of age. Collectively, there is supporting evidence of age-related differences in susceptibility to NO 2 health effects. Elders (>65 years of age) appears to be at increased risk of NO 2-related hospitalizations. Asthmatic childre n (<18 years of age) are likely to experience other adverse respiratory health outcomes with increased NO 2 exposure e.g. airways hyperresponsivness often accompanied by production of sputum, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and increased use of asthma medication. Toxicological evidence available in the 1993 AQCD also provided evidence for age-related differences in NO 2-induced lung injury. Neonates, prior to weaning, appeared to be rela tively resistant to effects of NO 2. However, responsiveness increased in young animals following weaning, appear ed to decline in mature animals, then an increase in responsiveness occurred at some poi nt in senescence. Additionally, new evidence since the 1993 AQCD raises concerns for increa sed severity and frequency of respiratory infections, decreased lung function growth, in creased onset of asthma and allergy, increase hospital and ED visits for asthmatic children.

(2005) reported on-road NO 2 concentrations in Los Angeles ranging from 40 to 70 ppb on freeways, compared to 20 to 40 ppb on residential or arteri al roads. People in traffic can potentially experience high concentrations of NO 2 as a result of the high air exchange rates for vehicles. Park et al. (1998) observed that the air exchange in cars varied from 1 to 3 times per hour, with windows closed and no mechanical ventilation, to 36 to 47 times per hour, with windows closed and the fan set on fresh air. These results imply that the NO 2 concentration inside a vehicle could rapidly approach those outsi de the vehicle during commuting. It follows that people with occupations that require them to be in or close to traffic or road ways (i.e. bus and taxi drivers, highway patrol officer s) could be different ially exposed to NO 2 and, therefore, should be considered a susceptible population. While driving, concentrations for persona l exposure in a vehicle cabin could be substantially higher than ambient concentrations measured near by. Sabin et al . (2005) reported that NO 2 concentrations in the cabins of school bus es in Los Angeles ranged from 24 to 120 ppb, which were typically factors of 2 to 3 (maximum, 5) higher than at ambient monitors in the area. Lewn\u00e9 et al. (2006) reported work hour exposures to NO 2 for taxi drivers (25.1 ppb), bus drivers (31.4 ppb), and truck drivers (35.6 ppb). Thes e levels were 1.8, 2.7, and 2.8 times ambient concentrations. Riediker et al . (2003) studied the exposure to NO 2 inside patrol cars. The authors found that the mean and maximum NO 2 concentrations in a patrol car were 41.7 and 548.5 ppb compared to 30.4 and 69.5 ppb for the ambien t sites. These studies suggest that people in traffic can be exposed to much higher levels of NO 2 than are obtained at ambient monitoring sites. Due to the high peak exposures while driving, total pe rsonal exposure could be underestimated if exposures while commuting ar e not considered; and sometimes exposure in traffic can dominate personal exposure to NO 2 (Lee et al., 2000; Son et al., 2004). Variations in traffic-related exposure could be at tributed to time spent in traffic, type of vehicle, and distance from major roads (Sabin et al ., 2005; Son et al., 2004; Chan et al., 1999). Sabin et al. (2005) reported that the intrusion of the vehicle's own exhaust into the passenger cabin is another NO 2 source contributing to personal exposure while co mmuting but that the fraction of air inside the August 2007 4-6 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 cabin from a vehicle's own exhaust was small, ranging from 0.02 to 0.28%, increasing with the age of the vehicle (CARB, 2007). Distance to major roadways could be anot her factor affecting indoor and outdoor NO 2 concentration, and personal NO 2 exposure. Many studies show that outdoor NO 2 levels are strongly associated with distance from major roads (i.e., the cl oser to a major road, the higher the NO 2 concentration) (Gilbert et al., 2005; Roorda-Knape et al., 1998; Lal and Patil, al., 2002; al., 2005; Cotterill and King ham, 1997; Nakai et al., 1995). Meteorological factors (wind dire ction and wind speed) and traffic density are also important in interpreting measured NO 2 concentrations (Gilbert et al., 2005; Roorda-Knape et al., 1998; Rotko et al., 2001; Alm et al., 1998 ; Singer et al., 2004; Nakai et al., 1995). Singer et al. (2004) reported results of the East Bay Children's Re spiratory Health Study. The authors found that NO 2 concentrations increased with decreasing downwind dist ance for school and neighborhood sites within 350 m downwind of a freeway, a nd schools located upwind or far downwind of freeways were generally indist inguishable from one another and regional pollution levels. Most studies show that indoor NO 2 is correlated with outdoor NO 2 and is also a function of distance to traffic, tra ffic density, and meteorological parameters. For example, Roorda-Knape et al. (1998) reported that NO 2 concentrations in classrooms were significantly correlated with car and total traffic density (r = 0.68), percentage of time downwind (r = 0.88) and distance of the school from the roadway (r = !0.83). Personal exposure is associated with traffi c density and proximity to traffic, although personal exposure is also influenced by indoor sources. Alm et al. (1998) reported that NO 2 exposures was higher for the children living in the downtown (13.9 ppb) than in the suburban area (9.2 ppb, p = 0.0001) of Helsinki. Within the urban area of Helsinki , Rotko et al. (2001) observed that the NO 2 exposure was significantly associated with traffic volume near homes. The average exposure level of 138 subjects having lo w or moderate traffic near their homes was 12.3 ppb, while the level was 15.8 ppb for the 38 subjec ts having high traffic volume near home. Gauvin et al. (2001) reported the ratio of traffic density to dist ance from a roadway was one of the significant interpreters of personal exposure in Grenoble, Toulouse, and Paris. After controlling indoor source impacts on personal exposure, Kodama et al. (2002) and Nakai et al. (1995) observed that personal exposure decreased with increasing distance from residence home to major road.

However, no published reports were found to address the effect of those sources on population exposure within the United States. Ne rriere et al. (2005) measured personal exposures to fine PM (PM 2.5), PM 10, and NO 2 in traffic dominated, urban background and industrial settings in Paris, Grenoble, Roue n, and Strasbourg, France. They always found highest ambient concentrations and personal exposu res close to traffic. In some cases, traffic urban background concentrations of NO 2 were higher than in the i ndustrial zone. However, PM levels and personal exposures tended to be highe r in the industrial area than in the traffic- dominated area. It should be remembered that there can be high traffic emissions in industrial zones, such as in the Ship Channel in Houston, TX . In rural areas where traffic is sparse, other sources could dominate. Martin et al. (2003) found pulses of NO 2 release from agricultural areas occur following rainfall. Ot her rural contributors to NO 2 include wildfires and residential wood burning. 4.1.4 Genetic Factors for Oxidant a nd Inflammatory Damage from Air Pollutants A consensus now exists among epidemiologists that genetic factors related to health outcomes and ambient pollutant exposures merit serious consideration (Kauffmann et al., 2004; Gilliland et al., 1999). Several crite ria must be satisfied in selecting and establishing useful links between polymorphisms in candidate genes and advers e respiratory effects. First, the product of the candidate gene must be significantly involved in the pathogenesis of the adverse effect of interest, often a complex trait with many determinants. Second, polymorphisms in the gene must produce a functional change in ei ther the protein product or in the level of expression of the protein. Third, in epidemiol ogical studies, the issue of c onfounding by other environmental exposures must be carefully considered. Several glutathione s-transferase (GST) fa milies have common, functionally important polymorphic alleles that significan tly affect host defense functi on in the lung (e.g., homozygosity for the null allele at the GSTM1 locus). GST genes are inducible by oxidativ e stress. Exposure to radicals and oxidants in air pollution induces decreases in GSH that in crease transcription of GS Ts. Individuals with genotypes that result in enzymes w ith reduced or absent peroxide activity are likely to have reduced oxidant defenses and increased suscepti bility to inhaled oxida nts and radicals.

(2006) investigated the re lationships between common polymorphisms in two genes involved in respons e to oxidative stress (i.e., GSTM1 and GSTP1) and both respiratory symptoms and lung function in response to O 3, NO 2, and PM 10 among 151 asthmatic children. The children were genotyped using polymerase chain react ion (PCR) methods and followed from October 1998 to April 2000. After ad justing for asthma severity, temperature, environmental tobacco smoke, chronological time and supplementation group, children with the GSTM1 null polymorphism were more likely to report difficulty breathing in response to O 3 than GSTM1 positive children. Children with the GS TP1 Val/Val genotype were more likely to experience breathing difficulty and bronchodilator use in response to O 3 compared with children with the GSTP1 Ile/Ile and Ile/Val genotype s. This pattern was consistent for O 3 exposure over various numbers of lag days. Table 4.1-1 shows the results for the effect of a 20-ppb exposure to NO 2 on respiratory symptom according to gene tic polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTP1. A small increase in breathing difficulty was observed with a 20-ppb increase in ambient NO 2 levels for all of the genotype groups across various numbers of lag days, though none of these associations was statistically signifi cant. This suggests that ambient NO 2 concentrations may affect breathing in children regardless of their GSTM1 or GSTP1 genotypes. In contrast to O 3, the GSTM1 positive and GSTP1 Ile/Ile and Ile/ Val genotype children were more likely to experience cough and bronchodilator use in response to NO 2 than GSTM1 null and GSTP11 Val/Val children. Contrary to expect ations, a 20-ppb increase in ambient NO 2 concentrations was associated with a decrease in bronchodilator use among GSTP1 Val/Val genotype children. A few studies of genotypes and respiratory hea lth or general air pollution also have been conducted. Lee et al. (2004) studied ninth grade schoolchildren w ith asthma in Taiwan for a gene-environmental interaction between GS TP1105 genotypes and out door pollution. While noting mean NO 2 levels of 41.2 ppb from 1994 to 2001, they examined general district air pollution levels of low, moderate, and high in the analysis and reported resu lts suggested of such an interaction of asthma, genotype and air pollution. Gilliland et al. (2002) examined effects of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genotypes and acute resp iratory illness, specifically respiratory illness related absences from school. The goal was to examine potential susceptibilities on this basis, but not specifically air pollutants. They concluded that fourth grade school children who inherited a GSTP1 Val105 variant a llele had a decreased risk of re spiratory illness related school absence, indicating that GSTP1 genotype influences the risk and/or sever ity of acute respiratory August 2007 4-9 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 infections in school-aged children. Gauderman et al. (2007) described a methodology that uses principal components (PC) analysis computed on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers for testing association between a disease and a candidate gene. As an example, they evaluated subjects in th e children's health study (CHS) looking at chronic bronchitis symptoms. The authors observed stronger evid ence of an association using th e PC approach (p = 0.044) than using either a genotype-based (p = 0.13) or haplotype-based (p = 0.052) approach. This methodology may be applied to relati onships in this and other databa ses to evaluate aspects of air pollutants such as NO 2. Khoury et al. (2005) states that wh ile genomics is still in its infancy, opportunities exist for developing, testing, and applying the tools of genomics to public health research with possible environmental causes. In summary, NO 2-related genetic effects have been pr esented primarily by Romieu et al. (2006) and indicate that asthmatic children w ith GSTM1 null and GSTP1 Val/Val genotypes appear to be more susceptible to deve loping respiratory symptoms related to O 3, but not NO 2, concentrations. It was suggested that ambient NO 2 concentrations may affect breathing in children regardless of their GSTM1 or GSTP1 genotypes. In contrast to O 3, the GSTM1 positive and GSTP1 Ile/Ile and Ile/Val genotype children were more likely to experience cough and bronchodilator use in response to NO 2 than GSTM1 null and GSTP11 Val/Val children. Contrary to expectations, a 20-ppb increase in ambient NO 2 concentrations was associated with a decrease in bronchodilator use among GSTP1 Val/V al genotype children. Understanding a basis for susceptibility to asthma, w ill facilitate improve the precision of future studies of air pollution and health. 4.1.5 Vulnerability Related to Socioeconomic Status Finally, it is possible that individuals w ith lower socioeconomic status be more vulnerable to the effects of exposure to NO 2. There are a range of potential factors that would cause increased vulnerability, in cluding reduced access to health care or living in areas with increased emissions, such as near major sour ces or roadways. However, the evidence specifically related to vulnerab ility is sparse. In one new study, Clougherty et al. (2007) evaluated the synergistic effects of tra ffic related air pollutants, including NO 2, and the synergistic effects between soci al and physical factors in asth ma, e.g. stress, violence.

In protecting public health, a distinction must be made between health effects that are considered \"adverse\" and those that are not. What constitutes an adverse health effect varies for different population groups, with some changes in healthy individuals not being viewed as adverse but those of similar type and magnitude in other susceptib le individuals with preexisting disease being seen as adverse. 4.2.1 Concepts Related to Defini ng of Adverse Health Effects The American Thoracic Society (ATS) pub lished an official statement on \"What Constitutes an Adverse Health E ffect of Air Pollution?\" (ATS, 2000b). This statement updated guidance for defining adverse respiratory health effects published 15 years earlier (ATS, 1985). The 2000 update takes into account (1) new investiga tive approaches used to identify the effects of air pollution; (2) increased fo cus on quality of life measures more sophisticated considerations of risks, particularly to susceptible groups; a nd (3) exposure to air pollu tion that increases the risk of an adverse effect to the entire population is viewed as adverse, even though it may not increase the risk of any identifia ble individual to an unacceptable leve l. For example, if the risk distribution for asthmatics is shifted toward increa sed risks, this is considered adverse even if this shift does not resu lt in clinically observa ble effects at the lower end of the distribution, because individuals within the population w ould have diminished reserve function. Reflecting new investigative approaches, the ATS statement also describes the potential usefulness of research into the genetic basis fo r disease, including responses to environmental agents that provide insights into the mechanistic basis for susceptibility and provide markers of risk status. Likewise, biomarkers that are indi cators of exposure, effect, or susceptibility may someday be useful in defining the point at wh ich one or an array of responses should be considered an adverse effect. In an attempt to provide info rmation useful in helping to define adverse health effects associated with ambient NO 2 exposure by describing the gradati on of severity and adversity of August 2007 4-11 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 respiratory related NO 2 effects, and those definitions are presented here as Tables 4.1-2 and 4.1-3. The severity of effects described in those tables and the approaches taken to define their relative adversity are adapted from the ATS statements (ATS, 1985, 2000). As assessed in detail in earlier chapters of this document and briefly recapitulated in preceding sections of this chapte r, exposures to a range of NO 2 concentrations have been reported to be associated with increasing severity of several categories of health effects. 4.2.2 Estimation of Potential Numbers of Persons in At-Risk Susceptible Population Groups in the United States 4.2.2.1 Asthma A recent CDC report (CDC, 2005) on the prevalence of asthma in the United States, states that the burden of asthma has increased over the past two decades. It is known that a complex set of factors influence asthma; it is not clear what factors are driving this increase in prevalence. In 1982, roughly 4% of people younger than 18 years old had asthma. Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease among child ren, and is the number one reason for school absences. By 1994, this rate had increased to almost 7%, or approximately five million people under the age of 18. Furthermore, from 1982 through 1994, the overall annual age-adjusted prevalence rate of asthma for people younger than 18 years old increased by 72%. In 2005, approximately 22.2 million (or 7.7% of the population) currently had asthma. The incidence was higher among children (8.9% of children) compared to adults ( 7.2% of adults.) Prevalence also is higher among certain ethnic or r acial groups, such as Puerto Rican s, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and African Americans. The asthma prevalence rate for black Americans in 1992 was just under 6%, representing almost two million pe ople with asthma. The prevalence rate among white was about 5%, which translates to approx imately 12 million people. Gender and age is also a determinant of prevalence, with adult females having a 40% higher prevalence rate than adult males, and boys having a 30% higher rate than girls. Additionally a recent study, Clougherty et al. (2007) evaluated th e synergistic effects of traffic relate air pollutants, including NO 2, and the synergistic effects between social and physical factors in asthma, e.g. stress, violence. The difference in prevalence among races may be related to differences in such things as socioeconomic status, living condi tions, diet, and allergen exposures.

Survey results published by Cent ers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2007 a,b) provide estimates of the prevalence of persons living with heart disease and stroke. The data used for the analyses was from the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). A random selection of the civilian population aged 18 years or more (n = 356,112) participated in the survey. Participants were asked if a doctor or other health professional had ever told them that they had a \"heart attack, also called a my ocardial infarction,\" \"angina or coronary heart disease,\" or \"stroke.\" Differences in prevalence were assessed by age, race/ethnicity/ sex, education, and state or territory of residence. Approximately 6.5% (13.6 million people, based on Census 2000 data) of respondents reported a history of MI, angina or coronary heart disease (CHD). Men reported a higher prevalence of heart disease than women, and prevalence increased with age. Hear t disease decreased with higher education, and American Indians/Alaska natives and multiracial persons had substantially higher prevalence of history of heart disease. Th e prevalence of heart disease al so varied depending on state of residence, with persons from West Virginia re porting the highest prevalen ce of heart disease. Approximately 2.6% of participants reported a history of stroke (approximately 5.4 million people, based on census 2000 data). Again, the prevalence of stroke increa sed with age, male gender, and lower educational at tainment. American Indians a nd Alaska natives reported a higher prevalence of stroke. In addition, residents for southern state repo rted a higher prevalence of history of stroke. Approximately 35 milli on people (12.4%) are above the age of 65 in the United States (Census 2000). Together, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and multiracial persons represent approximately 7.2 million people (2.5% of the U.S. population). August 2007 4-13 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE TABLE 4.1. NO 2 EXPOSURE AFFECTS ASTHMATICS An intervention study (Pilotto et al., 2004) of respiratory symptoms of asthmatic children in Australia resulted in reductions in several symptoms (difficulty in brea thing during the day and at night, chest tightness during the day and at night, and asthma attacks during the day) related to reduction in NO 2 exposure from in-class heaters. Information on other heater emissions, such as ultrafine particles, was not reported. Birth cohort studies in the Un ited Sates (Belanger et al., 2006 ; Van Strein et al., 2004) and Europe (Brauer et al., 2007) relate NO 2 concentrations to increas ed respiratory symptoms, infections, and asthma in the very young. In England, Chauhan et al. (2003) and Linaker et al. (2000) studied personal NO 2 exposure and found NO 2 exposure in the week before an upper re spiratory infection wa s associated with either increased severity of lower-respiratory-tract symptoms, or reduction of PEF for all virus types together, and for two of the common viruses, RSV and a picorna virus, individually. Nitschke et al. (2006) reported difficulty breathing and chest tightness associated with 10 ppb increases in NO 2 measured in school classrooms. Lung function tests were performed at the beginning and at the end of the study period, and the authors observed personal NO 2 exposures related in a dose-response manner for reported symptoms in asthmatics. United States multicity studies of ambient NO 2 exposure examined respiratory symptoms in asthmatics (Mortimer et al., 2002; Schildcrout et al., 2006). In the NCICAS (Mortimer et al., 2002) the greatest effect was seen for morning symptoms (cough, wheeze, shortness of breath) for a 6-day-morning average. In multi-pollutant models, the NO 2 effect was attenuated though remained positive, for O 3, SO 2, and combined coarse and fine particulate matter (PM 10). In the CAMP study (Schildcrout et al., 2006), the strongest association between NO 2 and increased risk of cough and increased us e of rescue medication was found for a 2-day lag, which was not attenuated, in two-pollutant models for CO, PM 10, or SO 2. Single city panel studies in the Los Angeles area are supportive of these associations for asthmatics (Ostro et al., 2001; Delfino et al., 2002, 2003a,b). Segala et al. (1998) and Just et al. (2 002), in Paris both found positive relationships to NO 2 exposure and symptoms in asthmatics. Few studies of the impact of NO 2 on respiratory symptoms of adult asthmatics are available. These find positive associations for NO 2 exposure and respiratory symptoms in European studies (Hiltermann et al., 1998; Von Klot et al., 2002; a nd Forseberg et al., 1998). The associations between ambient concentrations of NO 2 and ER visits for asthma in the United States are positive (Jaffe et al., 2003; Peel et al., 2005; Tolbert et al., 2000). Studies conducted outside the United States (Cas tlellsague et al., 1995; Sunye r et al., 1997; Atkinson et al., 1999a,b; Tenias et al., 1998; Erbas et al., 2005) found similar results. A concentration response for NO 2 and asthma ER visits is indicated in these studies (Jaffe et al., 2003; Tenias et al., 1998; Castellsague et al., 1995).

NO 2 EXPOSURE AFFECTS ASTHMATICS In relation to long-term exposure, Moseler (1994) examined a cohort in Germany and reported decrements in lung function parameters related to NO 2 exposure measures in a group of physician-diagnosed asthmatic children. The relationship between long-term NO 2 exposure and asthma prevalence and incidence has been examined in several studies. In the CHS, Gauderman et al. (2005) report a positive relationship. Further, Islam et al. (2007) studied the CHS cohort to determine whether lung function is associated with new onset asthma. A positive relationship was seen for NO 2 exposure, which was marginally significant whil e indications for PM we re significant. In a separate cohort in the Netherlands, Brauer et al. (2007) provide confirming evidence for this relationship. Acute mortality related to asthma was examined in Barcelona, Spain (Saez et al., 1999; Sunyer et al., 2002). In the study by S unyer et al.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 5.1 INTRODUCTION The previous chapters have presented the most policy-relevant science, integrated across disciplines, as it pertains to oxides of nitrogen. The goal of th is chapter is to summarize key findings and draw conclusions from this informati on. Sections of this ch apter are as follows: (1) this introducti on, (2) atmospheric sciences, (3 ) exposure assessment, (4) NO 2 exposure indices, (5) a summary of health effects, and (6) conclusions. It will be useful at the outset to distingui sh between the definitions of \"nitrogen oxides\" as it appears in the enabling le gislation related to the NAAQS and the definition commonly used in the air pollution research and management comm unity. In this document, the terms \"oxides of nitrogen\" and \"nitrogen oxides\" refer to all forms of oxidi zed nitrogen compounds, including NO, NO 2, and all other oxidized nitrogen-containi ng compounds transformed from NO and NO 2. This follows usage in the Clean Air Act Section 108(c): \"Such criteria [for oxides of nitrogen] shall include n itric and nitrous acids, nitrites, nitrates, nitrosamines, and other carcinogenic and potentially carcinogenic derivatives of oxides of nitrogen.\" By contrast, within the air pollution research and c ontrol community, the terms \"oxide s of nitrogen\" and \"nitrogen oxides\" are restricted to refer only to the sum of NO and NO 2, and this sum is commonly abbreviated as NO x. The category label used by this co mmunity for the sum of all forms of oxidized nitrogen compounds including t hose listed in Section 108(c) is NO y. For the current review, multiple species of many nitrogen oxides are considered as appropriate and as allowed by the available data. For example, descriptions of the atmospheric chemistry of nitrogen oxides include both gaseou s and particulate species, because a meaningful analysis would not be possible otherwise. In addition, the health effect s of gaseous nitrogen oxides other than NO 2 are evaluated when information on th ese other species is available. Finally, the possible influence of other atmospheri c pollutants on the interpre tation of the role of NO 2 in health effects studies is cons idered, including interactions of NO 2 with other pollutants that co-occur in th e environment (e.g., SO 2, CO, O 3, particulate matter). The available database for this draft ISA largely provides in formation on the health effects of NO 2, with limited information examining other forms of oxides of nitrogen (e.g., HONO). Thus, the review August 2007 5-1 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 examines a large NO 2 database along with other studies of other gaseous oxides of nitrogen, as available. 5.2 ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES Atmospheric sciences and exposure assessmen t are key elements in the causal chain linking pollutant sources to hea lth effects. Atmospheric ch emical processes involving NO 2 result in the formation of photochemical oxidants such as O 3 and PAN and precursors to acid aerosol formation such as the strong acid, mutagenic nitr o-PAHs and other potentially toxic compounds. Key findings related to measuring su ch compounds are listed below. The current method of determining ambient NO x (i.e., NO + NO 2) and then reporting NO 2 concentrations by subtraction of NO is subject to interference by NO x oxidation products (NO z), chiefly HNO 3 and PAN at levels that are largely uncharacterized and highly variable. Limited evidence suggest s that these compounds result in an overestimate of NO 2 levels by roughly 20 to 25% at ty pical ambient levels. Smaller errors are estimated to occur in m easurements taken nearer to strong NO x sources since most of the mass emitted as NO x would not yet have been further oxidized to NO z. Relatively larger errors, then, appear in locations more distant from strong local NO x sources. Techniques for measuring NO 2 more selectively than the FRM generally involve expensive and complex systems. As an example, NO 2 could be photolytically reduced to NO before detection by chemiluminescence in existing networks to eliminate the NO z interference; however, this tec hnique requires further development to ensure its reliability and cost effectiveness for extensive field deployment. A measurement of total oxidized nitrog en compounds, i.e., the sum of NO, NO 2, and all their reaction products, defined as NO y, would provide a more physically meaningful measurement of oxidized nitrogen than do measurements of NO x and NO 2 as reported currently. Existing NO x monitors could be converted to NO y monitors with relatively straightforward modifications. However, NO y monitors can be subject to relatively minor positive artifacts from particul ate nitrate compounds, and, like the FRM NO x August 2007 5-2 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 monitors, to positive interference by reduced nitrogen compounds if the converter temperature is not carefully controlled. Because motor vehicles are a large source of urban NO 2, ambient NO 2 generally behaves 3 much like a traffic-generated pollutant in urban areas. It is associat ed with other traffic- generated pollutants such as CO at ambien t levels and shows spatial and temporal variability consistent with othe r traffic-generated pollutants. Nitro-PAHs, which are responsible for most of the mutagenicity associated with ambient 7 PAH samples and other potentially toxic co mpounds are emitted both directly from automobile tailpipes and by other NO x sources and also are formed secondarily from atmospheric reactions of NO 2. Annual average concentrations of NO 2 (~15 ppb) are well below the level of the current NAAQS (53 ppb). However, daily maximum 1- h average concentrations can be greater than 100 ppb in a few locations, such as those heavily influenced by traffic. Policy Relevant Background Concentrations of NO 2 are much lower than average ambient concentrations and are typically le ss than 0.1 ppb over most of the United States, with highest values found in agricultural areas. Measurements of NO y have the additional benefit of ch aracterizing the entire suite of oxidized nitrogen compounds in ambien t air to which people are exposed. 5.3 EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT In assessing human exposures to NO 2, recall that people are exposed to the entire suite of oxidized nitrogen compounds th at are characterized by NO y and not just to NO 2 or NO x. The amount of time a person spends in different microenvironments and the infiltration characteristics of these microenvironments are strong determinants of the association between ambient NO 2 concentrations and human exposures. In addition to ambient NO 2, people are also exposed to NO 2 produced by indoor sources such as gas stoves, to NO 2 and other products of indoor air reactions, and to NO 2 in vehicles while commuting. Key findings related to assessing NO 2 exposures are listed below. Spatially, NO 2 is highly variable in urban areas, po tentially leading to exposure error resulting from either a lack of correlation or differences in levels between a central August 2007 5-3 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 monitoring site and the community aver age. Intersite correlations for NO 2 concentrations range from slightly negative to highly positiv e. The range of spatial variation in NO 2 concentrations is similar to that for O 3, but larger than that of PM 2.5. Twenty-four-hour concentration differences between individual pa ired sites in an MSA can be larger than the annual means at these sites. Rooftop NO 2 measurements, particularly in inne r cities, likely underestimate levels 6 occurring at or near the earth's surface closer to the vehicle emitters. Methods for measuring personal NO 2 generally correlate well with ambient methods in 8 collocated samples, but they tend to be biased high relative to reported ambient measurements and are subject to artifacts. In the absence of i ndoor sources, indoor NO 2 levels are about one-half those found outdoors. In the presence of indoor sources , particularly unvented combustion sources, NO 2 levels can be much higher than reported ambient concentrations. Alpha ( ), the fraction of the ambient NO 2 concentration that c ontributes to a person's exposure to ambient NO 2 ranged from ~0.3 to ~0.6 in studies where examined. Indoor exposures to NO 2 are accompanied by exposures to other products of indoor combustion and to products of NO 2 chemistry occurring indoors and outdoors, such as HONO. The evidence relating ambient levels to pe rsonal exposures is mixed. Most of the longitudinal studies examined f ound that ambient levels of NO 2 were reliable proxies of personal exposures to NO 2. However, a number of studies found no significant associations between ambien t and personal levels of NO 2. The differences in study results are related in larg e measure to differences in study design, to the spatial heterogeneity of NO 2 in study areas, to the presence of indoor sources, to seasonal and geographic differences in the infiltration of ambient NO 2, and to differences in the time spent in different microenvironments. Measurement artifacts and differences in analytical measurement capabilit ies could also have contribu ted to the mixed results. The collective variability in all of the above parameters, in general, contributes to exposure misclassification errors in air pollution-health outcome studies. A few European studies in which community averages of personal exposures were compared to either ambient or outdoor c oncentrations support the assumption that August 2007 5-4 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE ambient concentrations are a reasonable surr ogate for community average exposures in epidemiological studies. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 The available data are limited, but suggest that the regulatory ambi ent monitors provide reasonable proxies for personal exposures to NO 2. At the same time, variable, positive artifacts associated with measuring NO 2 using the Federal Reference Met hod severely limit its ability to serve as a precise indicator of NO 2 concentrations at typical ambient levels generally encountered outside of urban cores. Within the urban core, where many of the regulatory monitors are sited close to strong NO x sources such as traffic, th e positive artifacts are much smaller on a relative basis, and the measurement is more precise. Importantly, because the nitrogen species that introduce the positive artifacts in the FRM NO 2 measurement are present in ambient air, these artifacts introduce the same er ror into epidemiological studies. To alleviate these problems and provide a be tter understanding of the relations hips between nitrogen oxides and health outcomes, it may be appropriate either to adopt a different indicator for the mixture of nitrogen oxides, such as NO y-NO, or to actively aid continued development of the more specific techniques for measuring NO 2 with the goal of replacing th e current FRM method in the networks. 5.4 NO 2 EXPOSURE INDICES The available NO 2 indices used to indicate short-term ambient NO 2 exposure are daily maximum 1-h (1-h max); 24-h average; and 2-week average NO 2 concentrations. New data on short-term exposures have been published since the 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen. Some studies examined only one index, and these studie s form an evidence base for that individual index. A few studies used bot h 1-h and 24-h data and, thus, allow a comparison of these averaging periods. These include studies of resp iratory symptoms, ED visits for asthma, hospital admissions for asthma, and mortality. Meta-analysis regression results for asthma ED visits comparing effect estimates for the 1-h and 24-h time periods indicate that effect estimates are sl ightly, but not significantly, larger with a 24-h average compared with a 1-h max NO 2. Experimental studies in both animals and humans provided evidence that short-term NO 2 exposure (i.e., <1 h to 2-3 h) can result in re spiratory effects such as increased airways responsiveness or inflammation thereby incr easing the potential for exacerbation of August 2007 5-5 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 asthma. These findings generally support epidemiological evidence on short-term exposures, but do not provide evidence that distinguishes effects for one short-term averaging period from another. Based on these findings, we have conclude d that differences between 1-h and 24-h 4 exposures are unlikely for several health outcomes. 5.5 HEALTH EFFECTS 5.5.1 The 1993 AQCD Findings The 1993 AQCD for Oxides of Nitrogen found that there were two key health effects of greatest concern at ambient or ne ar-ambient concentrations of NO 2: (1) increases in airways responsiveness of asthmatic indi viduals after short-term exposur es and (2) incr eased occurrence of respiratory illness among children associ ated with longer-term exposures to NO 2. Evidence also was found for increased risk of emphysema, but this appeared to be of major concern only with exposures to levels of NO 2 much higher than current ambient levels of NO 2 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993). The ev idence regarding airway s responsiveness was drawn from controlled human exposure and animal toxicological studies showing both airways responsiveness and lung function changes, though there was a lack of a concentration-response relationship. Epidemiological studies reported increased respiratory symptoms with increased indoor NO 2 exposures, and animal toxicological findings of lung host defense system changes with NO 2 exposure provided a biologically plausi ble basis for these results. Subpopulations considered potentially more su sceptible to the effects of NO 2 exposure included persons with preexisting respiratory dis ease, children, and the elderly. In the 1993 AQCD, the epidemiological evidence for respiratory h ealth effects was limited, and no studies had considered effects such as hospital admissions, ED visits, or mortality. 5.5.2 New Findings New evidence developed since 1993 has generally confirmed and extended the conclusions articulated in the 1993 AQCD. Since the 1993 AQCD, the epidemiological evidence has grown substantially, including new field or panel studies on respiratory health outcomes, numerous time-series epidemiological studies of effects such as hospital admissions, August 2007 5-6 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 and a substantial number of studies evalua ting mortality risk with short-term NO 2 exposures. As noted above, no epidemiological studies were av ailable in 1993 that assessed relationships between oxides of nitrogen and outcomes such as hospital admissions, ED vis its, or mortality; in contrast, there are now dozens of epidemiologi cal studies on such outcomes included in this evaluation. Several new studies have reported findings from prospective cohort studies on respiratory health eff ects with long-term NO 2 exposure. Significant new evidence characterizing the responses of susceptible and vulnerabl e populations also has developed since 1993, particularly concerning children, as thmatics, and those living and working near roadways. While not as marked as the growth in the epidemiological literature, a number of new toxicological and controlled human exposure studies provide furt her insights into relationships between NO 2 and health effects. In the following subsections, we build upon previous chapters to draw conclusions regarding the overall strength of the evidence and extent to whic h causal inferences may be made. Where the associations observed in epidemiological and experimental studies are strong, consistent, coherent, and plausible, we have concluded that the relationship is \"likely causal.\" Where the epidemiological or clinical findings are generally strong and consistent, but the available experimental evidence is too limited to draw conclusions re garding coherence or plausibility of the results, we have concluded th at this relationship is \"suggestive.\" In some situations, the evidence from ep idemiological and experimental st udies is not found to be strong or consistent, and there is limited or no support for coherence and plausibility; these relationships we judge to be \"inconclusive.\" Where possible, we have also included observations about the concentrations at which effects ha ve been observed. A series of ta bles at the end of this chapter provide specific information supporting these conclusions. Table 5.5-1 summarizes the key findings of controlled human exposure studies, and the exposure levels at which those effects have been observed. Table 5.5-2 summarizes the lo west levels at which e ffects have been seen in toxicological studies for a series of effect categories. Table 5.5- 3 presents results of epidemiological studies on respiratory health effects, and it includes information about the distribution of NO 2 levels used in the study as presente d in the study publications (generally provided as mean and range). August 2007 5-7 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 5.5.2.1 Respiratory Health Effects and Short-Term Exposure to NO 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Taken together, recent studies provide strong scientific evidence that NO 2 is associated with a range of respiratory effects and describe a likely causal relationship between short-term NO 2 exposure and adverse effects on the respiratory system. This is based on findings from numerous new epidemiological studies, includi ng multipollutant studies that control for the effects of other pollutants. This conclusion is supported by evidence from toxicological and controlled human exposure studies. A number of studies have been conducted in areas where the full distribution of ambient 24-h average NO 2 concentrations was below the current annual- average NAAQS level of 53 ppb (see data in Tables 5.5-3A and 5.5-3B). Ke y findings related to assessing NO 2 associated health effects are listed below. The strongest new epidemiological evidence ex ists for associations with increased ED visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, especially asthma and COPD, with ambient concentrations of NO 2. In nearly all of these st udies, high correlations were found between ambient measures of NO 2 and of CO and PM. The effect estimates for NO 2 were robust after the inclusion of CO and PM in multipollutant models. Significant associations have been reported in some st udies conducted in areas such as Vancouver, Canada, where daily NO 2 concentrations were all below the level of the current annual NAAQS. Results from recent field and panel studies c onfirm previous studies that short-term NO 2 exposure is associated with increase d respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, wheeze), particularly in children and asthmatics. Fe w recent epidemiological evaluations of lung function measures such as FEV 1, and PEF exist, providing only limited new evidence for pulmonary effects of NO 2 exposure. Recent studies reporting associations betw een indoor and personal exposure to NO 2 and respiratory symptoms or lung function provide key support for epidemiological findings of associations with NO 2 concentrations (e.g., Pilotto et al., 2004, Chauhan et al., 2004). In particular, the Pilotto et al. (2004) intervention study provides strong evidence of a detrimental effect with exposure to NO 2. A recent epidemiological study (Chauhan et al ., 2003) provided evidence that increased personal exposures to NO 2 worsen virus-associated symptoms and lung function in August 2007 5-8 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 children with asthma. The limited evidence from controlled human exposure studies indicates that NO 2 may increase susceptibility to injury by subsequent viral challenge. Controlled human exposure studies provide st rong evidence in asthmatics for increased 3 airways responsiveness to bronchoconstricting agents with short-te rm exposure to 0.2 to 0.3 ppm NO 2. The clinical significance of increase d airways reactivity is the potential for a flare-up or exacerbation of asthma or ot her underlying pulmonary disease following increased bronchial response to nonspecific ai rborne irritants. These studies do not provide compelling evidence for other respir atory effects such as changes in lung function. Toxicological studies have shown that lung host defenses are sensitive to NO 2 exposure, with numerous measures of such effects observed at c oncentrations below 1 ppm. Biological markers of inflammation are repor ted in antioxidant-d eficient laboratory animals with exposures to 0.4-ppm NO 2. Normal animals do not respond until exposed to much higher levels, i.e., $5 ppm NO 2. Recent epidemiological studies provide somewhat mixed evidence on short-term exposure to NO 2 and inflammatory responses in the airways. Controlled human exposure st udies provide evidence for increased airways inflammation at NO 2 concentrations of <2.0 ppm; the onset of inflammatory responses in healthy subjects appears to be between 100 and 200 ppm-min, i.e., 1 ppm for 2 to 3 h. 5.5.2.2 Cardiovascular Effects and Short-Term Exposure to NO 2 Overall, the evidence is inconclu sive regarding the effect of NO 2 on the CV system. Numerous epidemiological studies report an association of NO 2 with hospital admissions or ED visits for CVD (MI and CHF in partic ular). However, PM and other ambient air pollutants were also associated with hospitaliz ations. Further, results from multipollutant models were inconsistent, with no clear pattern emerging to s uggest that the NO 2 associations observed were robust. Epidemiological evidence from studies of HRV and cardiac rhythm disorders provide limited evidence of associations with NO 2. The parameters measured in these studies were associated most strongly with PM compared to other ambient pollutants, so the effects observed for NO 2 may have been confounded. Furthermore, a study of August 2007 5-9 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 repolarization changes found no association between NO 2 and the outcomes measured, while an effect for PM was observed. The limited evidence from controlled huma n exposure studies suggests a reduction in 3 hemoglobin with NO 2 exposure may occur at concen trations between 1.0 and 2.0 ppm (with 3-h exposures), but the observations require confirmati on. The results on the effect of NO 2 on various hematological parameters in animals are inconsistent and, thus, provide little biological plausibility for effects on the CV system. 5.5.2.3 Mortality and Short-Term Exposure to NO 2 Epidemiological evidence is suggest ive of associations between NO 2 and nonaccidental and cardiopulmonary-related mortality, but add itional research is needed to establish underlying mechanisms by which such effects occur. Results from several large U.S. and European multicity studies and a meta-analysis study observed positive associations between ambient NO 2 concentrations and risk of all-cause (nonaccidental) mortality, with effect estimates ranging from 0.5 to 3.6% excess risk in mortality. In general, the effect estimates we re robust to adjustment for copollutants. Both CV and respiratory mortality have been associated with increased NO 2 concentrations in epidemiological studies; however, similar associations were observed for other pollutants, including PM and SO 2. Clinical studies showing hematologic effect s (noted above) and animal toxicological studies showing biochemical, lung host defe nse, permeability, and inflammation changes with short-term exposures to NO 2 provide limited evidence of plausible pathways by which risks of morbidity and, potentially, mo rtality may be increased, but no coherent picture is evident at this time. While NO 2 exposure, alone or in conjunction with other pollutants, may contribute to increased mortality, evaluation of the specific ity of this effect is difficult. Limited experimental evidence exists to prohibits cons idering biological plausibility at this time, and the range of mortality risk estimates is sm aller than that for other pollutants such as PM. It is possible that NO 2 is acting as a marker for another pollutants or traffic-related mixtures. August 2007 5-10 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 5.5.2.4 Morbidity and Long-Term Exposure to NO 2 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 The available epidemiological and toxicological data provide suggestive evidence that long-term exposure to NO 2 affects respiratory health. A number of epidemiological studies examin ed the effects of long-term exposure to NO 2 4 and observed associations with decrements in lung function, and partially irreversible decrements in lung function growth. In one analysis, results were similar for boys compared to girls and among children who did not have a history of asthma: clinically significant differences in lung function remain ed at age 18. These studies, however, are confounded by other ambient pollutants. In par ticular, associations are also found for PM and proximity to traffic (<500 m). As shown in Table 5.5-3C, the mean NO 2 concentrations in these studies range from 21.5 to 34.6 ppb; thus, all have been conducted in areas where NO 2 levels are below the level of the NAAQS (53 ppb, annual average). A limited number of epidemiological studies ex amined the effects of long-term exposure to NO 2 and observed associations with increas es in asthma prevalence. However, potential confounding by other ambient pollutants introduces uncertainty. Animal toxicological studies de monstrate that exposure to NO 2 results in morphological changes in the centriacinar region of the lung and in bronchiolar epithelial proliferation, which may provide biological plausibility for the observed increased incidence of respiratory illness. Two epidemiological studies conducted in Eur ope showed an association between long- term NO 2 exposure and cancer incidence, althoug h animal studies have provided no clear evidence that NO 2 acts as a carcinogen. There are no in vivo studies suggesting that NO 2 causes malignant tumors and no evidence of mu tagenicity. Substantial evidence exists that nitro-PAHs are formed via combination of NO x and other air pol lutants, though many of these are found in the particulate phase. The PAHs are considered to be known human carcinogens, and nitration of PAHs is thought to increase carcinogenic potential. No studies have been conducted on potential CV effects of long-term exposure to oxides of nitrogen. Epidemiological evidence is weak for associations between NO 2 exposure and intrauterine growth retarda tion and preterm delivery. Limited toxicological evidence suggests a weak association between NO 2 exposure and adverse birth outcomes and August 2007 5-11 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 provides little mechanistic information or biol ogical plausibility for the epidemiological findings. 5.5.2.5 Mortality and Long-Term Exposure to NO 2 Results from the few available epidemiologi cal studies are inconc lusive regarding the association between long-term exposure to NO 2 and mortality. A limited number of epidemiological studies ha ve investigated the effect of long-term 7 exposure to NO 2 on mortality. In general, inconsiste nt associations we re observed across study locations and cause-specific mortality outcomes. Multipollutant analyses were usually not conducted, but studies indicated high correlations between NO 2 and PM indices (r ~ 0.8). 5.5.2.6 Concentration-Response Relationships and Thresholds An important consideration in characterizing the public health impacts associated with NO 2 exposure is whether the con centration-response relationship is linear across the full concentration range that is enc ountered or if nonlinear departures exist along any part of this range. Of particular interest is the shape of the c oncentration-response cu rve at and below the level of the current annual aver age standard of 53 ppb (0.053 ppm). Identifying possible \"thresholds\" in air pollution epidemiologi cal studies is problematic. Various factors tend to linear ize the concentration-respons e relationships, obscuring any thresholds that may exist. Exposure measurem ent error, response measurement error, and low data density in the lower concen tration range are some factors that complicate determining the shape of the concentration-res ponse curve. Biological in susceptibility to health effects, additivity of pollutant-induced effect s to the naturally occurring background disease processes, and the extent to which health effect s are due to other environmental insults having a mode of action similar to that of NO 2. Additionally, if the concentration-response relationship is shallow, identification of any threshold that may exist will be more difficult. The slope of the NO 2 concentration-response relationshi p has been explored in several studies. To examine the shape of the c oncentration-response relationship between NO 2 and daily physician consultations for asthma and lower resp iratory disease in children, Hajat et al. (1999) used bubble plots to examine resi duals of significant models plotted against moving averages of August 2007 5-12 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 NO 2 concentration. They noted a weak trend for asthma and 0-1 day moving average of NO 2 and suggested that effects are we aker at low concentrations and stronger at higher concentrations than predicted by the linear model. These de partures are in accord with the sigmoidal dose- response models. A number of epidemiological studies have reported no evidence for nonlinear relationships or a threshold res ponse in relationships between NO 2 and mortality or morbidity. One multicity time-series study (Samoli et al ., 2006) examined the relationship between mortality and NO 2 in 29 European cities. There was no indication of a response threshold, and the concentration-response curves were consistent with a li near relationship. Kim et al. (2004b) investigated the presence of a threshold in rela tionships between air pollutants and mortality in Seoul, Korea, by analyzing data using a log-linear GAM (linear model), a cubic natural spline model (nonlinear model), and a B-mode splined model (threshold model). The 24-h average NO 2 level was 32.5 ppb (SD 10.3); there was no evidence that NO 2 had a nonlinear association with mortality. Burnett et al. (1997a) us ed the LOESS smoothing method to present nonparametric concentration-response curves for respiratory and cardiac ho spitalizations. These smoothed curves did not have sign ificant departures from the lin ear model. One problem with this approach is that the LOESS smoothed curv e may lack biological rati onale. Burnett et al. (1997b) tested for nonlinearity by testing the sign ificance of the quadratic term in a study of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases an d reported no evidence for nonlinearity for the association with NO 2. In studies that have specifically examined concentration-response relationships between NO 2 and health outcomes, there is little evidence of an effect threshold. Factors that make difficult identification of any thresh old that may exist are noted above. 5.5.2.7 Susceptible and Vulnerable Populations Several susceptible subpopulations can be identified. Based on both short- and long-term studies of an array of respiratory and cardiac health effects data, asthmatics and persons with pr eexisting cardiopulmonary conditions are at greater risk from ambient NO 2 exposures than the general public, with the most extensive evidence available for asthmatics as a potenti ally susceptible group. In addition, studies suggest that upper respiratory vi ral infections can trigger sus ceptibility to the effects of exposure to NO 2.

Limited studies, however, provide no evidence that they are more susceptible to the effects of NO 2 than the general population. In addition to observed increases in NO 2-exposure-related illnesses, a general shift of the population response distribution towards greater se nsitivity to illness is anticipated. This shift, in itself is considered adverse. 5.6 CONCLUSIONS New evidence confirms previous findi ngs in the 1993 AQCD that short-term NO 2 exposure is associated with increased airways responsiveness, often accompanied by respiratory symptoms, particularly in children and asthmatics. Additionally, the new body of epidemiological data provides strong evidence of associations with in creased ED visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes, especi ally asthma and COPD, and short-term ambient exposure to NO 2. These new findings are based on nume rous studies, including panel and field studies, multipollutant studies that control for the effects of other pollutants, and studies conducted in areas where the full distribution of ambient 24-h average NO 2 concentrations was below the current NAAQS of 53 ppb (see data in Table 5.5-3A and 5.5-3B). These conclusions are supported by evidence from toxicologica l and controlled human exposure studies. Individually and together, these da ta sets form a plausible, consis tent, and coherent description of a relationship between NO 2 exposures and an array of adverse health effects that range from the onset of respiratory symptoms to hospital admission. It is difficult to determine from these new studies if NO 2 is the causal agent or if NO 2 is a marker for the effects of another traffic-related pollutant or mix of pollutants (see Chapter 2 and Section 5.4 for more details on exposure issu es). To understand the relationship of NO 2 and impacts on public health with more certainty, one must turn to other lines of evidence.

Recent studies reporting associations between personal exposure to NO 2 indoor sources and respiratory sy mptoms provide key support for epidemiological findings of associations with ambient NO 2 concentrations. In particular, an intervention study (Pilotto et al., 2004) provide s strong evidence of a detrimental effect on asthmatic children of exposure to NO 2 from indoor sources. Additionally, a complex set of recent controlled human exposure studies provides good evidence for increased airways responsiveness to alle rgen-induced inflammation and allergen-induced bronchoconstriction following short-term exposure to levels of NO 2 in the range of 0.26 ppm. The significance of increased airways responsiveness is the potential for exacerbation of asthma. Increases in biological markers of inflammation are also report ed in antioxidant-deficient laboratory animals exposed to 0.4-ppm NO 2; however, it is not clear how these antioxidant-deficient laboratory animals differ from humans. An argument can be made that NO 2 exacerbates the response to allergen challenge and worsens virus-associated symptoms in asthmatic children, although data to support this argument is more limited. A recent epidemiological st udy (Chauhan et al., 2003) provided evidence that an increased personal exposure to NO 2 worsens virus-associated symptoms and lung function in children with asthma. Controlled human exposure studies of healthy adu lts, conducted at higher than ambient concentrations, also provide limited evidence that NO 2 may increase inflammation and increase susceptibility to injury associated with subsequent viral challenge. Lastly, but importantly, la rge, well-conducted prospect ive studies provide strong evidence of partially irreversib le decreased lung function growth and lung function capacity among children with long-term exposure to NO 2 and/or traffic. These studies do not suggest that NO 2 alone is responsible for these deficits. Chro nic animal toxicological studies, at higher than ambient exposure concentrations, demonstrate that exposure to NO 2 results in morphological changes in the centriacinar region of the lung and bronchiolar epithelial pr oliferation and provide biological plausibility for th e lung function growth decrem ents observed in children. Integrating across the epidemiological, clinical , and animal evidence presented above, we find that it is plausible, consistent , and coherent that current ambient NO 2 exposures directly result in adverse impacts to public health at concentrations below the current NAAQS for NO 2. In particular, a set of coherent and plausibl e respiratory health out comes indicative of August 2007 5-15 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE August 2007 5-16 DRAFT-DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 exacerbated asthma are associated with NO 2 exposures: increase airways hyperresponsivness, inflammation, impair host defense, a progression of respiratory symptoms, worsened virus infections, emergency room visits, and hospita l admission. Additionally, evidence is suggestive of potentially permanent decr eased lung function capacity an d increased mortality. The evidence presented in Chapters 2, 3, and 4 also leads us to conclude that NO 2 can be expected to be an indicator of the effects of traffic-related pollu tants. Furthermore, since is it well known that traffic-relate d pollutants other than NO 2 produce adverse effects on public health, it is reasonable to conclude that the impact of multiple pollutant mixtures on public health produce greater impacts on public health than would be expected from NO 2 alone.
