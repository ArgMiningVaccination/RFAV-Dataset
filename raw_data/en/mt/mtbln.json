After 15+ years of chronic pain and working with numerous professionals, I found Dr. Lauren. From our initial meeting, I knew that Dr. Lauren was a perfect fit for me. Professional and compassionate, Dr. Lauren took the time to listen and learn about my experience. During each appointment, she puts me at ease and gives me hope as she works with my structural alignment, muscle tension and emotional struggles with chronic pain. She understands instinctively what my body/mind needs to bring me back into balance and optimal wellness. She encourages my own work with Somatics to release my muscle tension and is able to \"listen with her hands\" to give me adjustments, release fascia or move trapped energy. Most recently, she's given me cranial adjustments which allow me to relax my \"fight or flight\" response and calm my entire body. I am 61 years old and feel better than I have in decades. Prior to working with Dr. Lauren, my focus was always on the pain. I never dreamed I could feel so attuned and at peace with my body/mind. Dr. Lauren has changed my relationship to aging as I better understand what I need to feel comfortable and energized. Dr. Lauren changed my life and I will be forever grateful.\" \" I have been a strong advocate of chiropractic care for over fifteen years and have received regular care form several different doctors in the multiple cities in which I have lived over that time. I can't say it enough, Lauren stands out head and shoulders above the rest! My experience with her was absolutely second to none. Her approach, knowledge, and methodology are incredible, but even beyond that, she has a truly intuitive touch and is amazingly attentive to her clients' specific needs. I even had an issue that had persisted for nearly two years with a minimal decrease in symptoms over that time (all with at least monthly visits to my regular chiropractor), and after just two visits with Lauren, I felt not just a noticeable change, but the symptoms had been relieved altogether...something that I honestly had stopped expecting! She is such an asset to her trade, her community, and most importantly, the people fortunate enough to be under her care! Thank you, Lauren!\" \"Meeting Lauren and Jade at Lux Wellness has been a delight and gift to my wellness needs. Lauren's knowledge and expertise as a chiropractor has given me the chance to work on solving some persistent injuries. Her gentle nature has allowed me to relax into the process of healing. These gals are going to remain a part of my \"team\" to help with aging gracefully.\" \"I was very pleased with my first visit to Lux. Sarah led me to the office very skillfully and Lauren made me feel relaxed and cared for.\" \"Love coming. You are like family.\" \"At the age of 59, I sought out Dr. Jade Wimberley's consultation to help monitor my aging process by interpreting blood tests and boosting my system with vitamin-mineral drips. She is pragmatic, and asked me interesting questions like: 'How are you sleeping?' and 'How are you pooping?' She is present. Her bedside manner is assuring. Dr. Wimberley is keenly interested in the complexities of the human organism and tends to not rush to a conclusion. She is an advocate of the ancient medical models in which one went to the doctor to maintain one's health, as opposed to putting it off until the dis-ease was fully developed. Through our consultations, I developed a deeper trust and knowing of my body's ability to heal itself.\" \"I am always a little nervous when seeing a new practitioner, but Lauren has a \"natural healer\" energy that can't be taught, it just comes through so clearly in her touch. The result was that I felt ease in her care that allowed for an adjustment that was way beyond physical structure.\" \"Dr. Lauren Whittaker is a loving, gentle and powerful healer. She brings so much joy to the world and I am truly blessed to have been adjusted by her. Her hands are masterful, her words so wise and her heart so loving. I highly recommend Lux Wellness Center to all!\" \"Dr . Lauren is more than just a chiropractor, she gives so much love and individual attention to each patient. I felt she personalize my appointments based on my needs and listened to my thoughts and concerns. She understands that chiropractic is more than just back pain; it's about the overall physical, mental, and spiritually health of the person. I'm forever grateful!\" |lks | noun Latin word for \"light.\" The "}
