We vaccinate against lots of childhood diseases now because we are told that having the diseases is a bad thing and leads to thousands of deaths. However, when we look at the figures from the Office for National Statistics, we see that 95% of the people who used to die from measles stopped dying before the vaccine was introduced in 1968 and similarly 99% of the people who used to die of whooping cough. The mortality rate for tuberculosis fell no differently in countries that did and did not use the BCG vaccine. Scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and typhus were deadly killers. They all disappeared without a vaccine. Why?

Courts can clarify, and at times they do so in very explicit terms, as happened last year in Austria\". Dr. Nancy Banks is a graduate of Hunter College and Harvard Medical School. As a senior medical student she was awarded a scholarship from the American College of Surgeons to study surgery and tropical medicine at the Benin Medical College in Benin, Nigeria. She completed her internship and residency in general surgery and obstetrics and gynecology at St. Luke's and Mt. Sinai Hospital and Medical Center. She was a Galloway Fellow in gynecological oncology at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Dr. Banks has a master's degree in finance from Pace University. Dr. Banks spent twenty-five years practicing general obstetrics and gynecology during which she was also the director of outpatient gynecology at The North General Hospital in Harlem, New York and served as an attending physician at not only North General, but Nyack Hospital in Nyack, New York, the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and the Mt. Sinai Hospital and Medical Center. She felt that it was an honor and a privilege to attend to the thousands of women who trusted her with their care as their primary care physician or as their obstetrician or their surgeon. During her years of practice Dr. Banks was daily confronted by a caravan of drug representatives in her office and at medical conferences. She became aware of not only how the pharmaceutical industry controls the practice of allopathic medicine but specifically how the industry targets women and increasingly their children. This industry more through propaganda than science has cleverly medicalized normal life processes and transitions and has promoted the use of drugs when additional non-patentable nutrient replenishments are indicated. By reading original journal reports she learned how the industry used its money and its might to suppress countless medical discoveries. Had these discoveries not been suppressed we would not be facing the terrible current health challenges and skyrocketing costs of the insurance industry. Finally, she became acutely aware of the deception and fraud in the deliberate suppression of information about the adverse effects of their products to physicians and by extension to the public.

She earned a bachelor's degree in theoretical physics from Rutgers University in 1987. After a two year education as the head technician in a research biochemistry lab, she went to medical school, graduating from Temple University School of Medicine in 1993. She then explored the area of social medicine in the Bronx NY where she completed her 3 year medical residency. At this juncture, Dr Humphries became more aware of the failures of primary care medicine, observing that doctors are largely trained to prescribe drugs and hunt down disease. Despite this approach, the patients continued to get sicker, requiring more drugs and ultimately developing degenerative diseases. Not wanting involvement in the generation of chronically ill patients, she opted to work at the other end of the allopathic continuum. After 14 years of practicing medicine in the form of Nephrology, or otherwise known as kidney medicine, her perspective on the overall success of the allopathic paradigm has developed and matured. She views allopathic medicine as an overused system- that when implemented as first line treatment across-the-board for mild illnesses and symptoms, will mostly just drive the forces that generate chronic illnesses. She has been a student of homeopathy for 4 years and is at the end of her studies to becoming a fully certified homeopathic physician.

Dr. Tenpenny was board certified in Emergency Medicine through 2005 (she chose not to renew) and has been board certified in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine since 1995. Prior to her career in alternative medicine, Dr. Tenpenny served as director of the Emergency Department at Blanchard Valley Regional Hospital Center in Findlay, Ohio, from 1987 to 1995. In 1994, she and a partner opened OsteoMed, a medical practice in Findlay limited to the specialty of osteopathic manipulative medicine. Vaccine Nation At the end of the eighteenth century, British physician Edward Jenner, with highly questionable medical credentials, initiated the theory and practice of live virus immunization that continues to serve as the scientific basis for the ever increasing vaccination of the world's citizens. With the number of vaccinations given to infants and children rising, kids are receiving doses of toxic mercury and other heavy metals well above environmental safety levels. Yet the medical evidence is clear. Mercury, known as thimerosal, and other heavy metal additives are highly toxic and threaten children with neurological damage. The long-term efficacy of global vaccination remains controversial, inconclusive and is suspect in light of the powerful corporate interests, lobbying efforts, and profits associated with a multi-billion dollar vaccine industry.. In his documentary film Vaccine Nation, award-winning investigative film director Dr. Gary Null challenges the basic health claims by government health agencies and pharmaceutical firms that vaccines are perfectly safe. This is one of the most critical questions facing today's children and future generations to come. If inoculation with a large regimen of vaccines is safe, what can account for the rapid increase in autism and other mental disabilities that are now at epidemic proportions? And why isn't the sudden onset of neurological illnesses in children being treated as an urgent crisis by our government and medical industries? Weaving together interviews with many of the nations most expert medical researchers, private physicians specializing in autism, parents of children victimized by immunization, congressmen, vaccination activists, legal authorities and more, Vaccine Nation will awaken viewers to one of the continual perils to the health and future of children.

Mark retired during the last decade. He says he was \"disgusted with what he discovered about vaccines.\" He is a little reluctant to speak out, even under the cover of anonymity, but with the current push to make vaccines mandatory -- with penalties like quarantine lurking in the wings -- he has decided to break his silence. He lives comfortably in retirement, but like many, he has developed a conscience about his former work. Excerpt: Q: \"Looking back now, can you recall any good reason to say that vaccines are successful? A: No, I can't. If I had a child now, the last thing I would allow is vaccination. I would move out of the state if I had to. I would change the family name. I would disappear. With my family. I'm not saying it would come to that. There are ways to sidestep the system with grace, if you know how to act. There are exemptions you can declare, in every state, based on religious and/or philosophic views. But if push came to shove, I would go on the move.\" George Bernard Shaw: \"Within my long lifetime, its ruthless enforcement throughout Europe ended in two of the worst epidemics of smallpox in record, our former more dreaded typhus and cholera epidemics having meanwhile been ended by sanitation. After that failure, the credit of vaccination was saved for a while by the introduction of isolation, which at once produced improved figures. At present, intelligent people do not have their children vaccinated, nor does the law now compel them to. The result is not, as the Jennerians prophesied, the extermination of the human race by smallpox; on the contrary more people are now killed by. vaccination than by smallpox. Yet the British Government, against the law, has just made vaccination compulsory in the Army by explicitly refusing to discipline an officer who has had an objector forcibly vaccinated; and the House of Commons received the news with cheers. Why does this exploded superstition persist? Simply because our education is not controversial, which means that as it is a hundred years out of date on all open questions, reforms have to come from the uneducated who suffer from the facts and know nothing of the books. . My own education has been entirely controversial: that is why I know what I am writing about; and appear eccentric to dogmatically educated Old School Ties whose heads are stuffed with obsolete shibboleths.\" George Bernard Shaw (August 9, 1944, the Irish Times).

Ever since vaccinations were introduced 200 years ago there has been a lot of controversy surrounding them. Some people think of illnesses as being primarily dangerous or at least inconvenient. They see vaccinations as an effective means to avoid diseases and possibly even eradicate them while others see the benefits of certain diseases and the potential dangers of vaccinations.
