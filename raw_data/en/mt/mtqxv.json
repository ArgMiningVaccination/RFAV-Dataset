Sense of Community I grew up with a very strong sense of community. In fact, I belonged to several communities: the kids in my neighbor-hood, my peers in school, my soccer buddies, and my friends in the youth movement. Although I was materially very poor, I was spiritually very rich. I was surrounded by caring commu-nities. After my parents died when I was eight years old, I was raised by a loving aunt and protected by friends who knew, intuitively, how to be there for me. As I grew older, my communities of care evolved. My own family has been an anchor and a rock. The financial risks that many families face today compound the isolation that many experience. Lack of community exacerbates the stress of material deprivation. Well-being requires both: material and spiritual resources. The current economic crisis affects vast sectors of the popu- lation. Perhaps you know somebody who has been laid off, a student who couldn' t return to UM because of financial problems, or a family facing foreclosure. Caring and compassion will not undo the damage of the economic col- lapse instigated by greed and demagoguery. But, they are an essential component of the good society. Promoting a sense of community is an important first step in building human and social capital. The question is: Can you turn human and social capital into financial capital? In the long term, I believe you can. Social capital, turned into social movements, can be used to ad- vance social justice. And justice, in turn, is the fair and equita-ble distribution of resources. He lping others, not just with em- pathy and sympathy, but also with empowerment and partici- pation in the democratic process, can contribute to social jus- tice and the prevention of economic crises like the one we are now facing. Isolated, despondent, and demoralized people may easily give up on the quest to find their individual and collective voice. A sense of community is an antidote to these ailments. In the School of Education, we need to be concerned with the students, staff, and faculty who are facing economic chal-lenges. Now, more than ever, we need to strengthen our sense of community. I continue to advocate for our financial future, but I worry that some of our people in the school may be suffering because of the recession. I have no magic solu- tions, but I know that a sense of community and solidarity are essential ingredients in caring for each other and for our stu-dents. If you know of people in need of help, don't ignore the situation just because you don't have an answer. Talk to them and talk to me. A community that cares for its people doesn't ignore its people. If a sense of community is a key ingredient of a successful organization, so is a mission. Our vision is to study, promote, and integrate psychological, educational, and physical well-being in multicul- tural communities, and our mission is to produce knowledge and train the next generation of leaders and agents of well-being in education and the com- munity. We have been fortunate recently to hire two new professors who believe in our vision and mission. Laura Kohn Wood join s EPS as Associ ate Professor and Patrick Walsh joins ESS as Assistant Professor. They join an exemplary group of faculty, staff and students. In financial terms, we are not a big player in the university scene. Our budget amounts to 0. 5% of the entire university budget. You might say that we're not more than a rounding error. Yet, in terms of our contribution to UM, some statistics are worth noting: we are the highest ranked graduate school; and on a per capita basis, we graduate more doctoral stu- dents than any other school and are third in obtaining exter-nal funding. In addition to these comparative indicators, we continue to place excellent teachers in the community, and our professors continue to help schools, as in the case of Marjorie Montague's project Solve It!

Our new ma- jor in Human and Social Development is already attracting students who want to improve commu- nity well-being, and plans for our new graduate program in Community and Educational Leader-ship are well underway. The media haven't failed to pay attention to our good works. Recently, Okhee Lee's P-SELL pro- ject was featured in Education Week and the local newspaper carried stories on our great Teacher Support Network and on the educational and com- munity work that Beth Harry does in Trinidad and Tobago. Walter Secada was also featured in na- tional media on math education via the net. On the scholarly front, our professors continue to publish at a healthy pace. Gene Provenzo, for in- stance, has recently published the Encyclopedia of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education. Many of our professors contributed to the volumes. Guerda Nicolas, in turn, used her own scholarship to shed light on the challenges faced by the Black community of Miami. Together with her graduate students, Guerda led a session on the psychoso- cial and economic problems faced by that commu-nity. Her students noted t he many strengths of the community, including of course their sense of com- munity. Wes Smith also brought his scholarship to the community. He planned with students a health fair that was very well attended. And these are only some of the ways in which we translate scholar-ship into well-being. Indeed, the quality of the people in the school is second to none. Each one of you makes an impor- tant contribution to our personal, organizational, and collective well-being. In the fall we hosted a workshop on evolutionary theory and education that reinforced my strong belief that private suc-cess is a communal endeavor (visit our website education.miami.edu for a link to the presenta- tions). Individuals thrive in environments that are conducive to creativity and collaboration. Hostile environments generate fear, and fear is the worst enemy of thriving. I call on you to call on me when I fail to improve our environment and our sense of community. Isaac Exercise Physiology Organization by Dr. Wesley Smith The Exercise Physiology Organization held a Health Fair at the LaGorce Country Club in Miami Beach. The students set up 4 stations: 1) A cardiovascular health section where they measured heart rate, blood pressure and aerobic capacity of the club mem bers. They provided the me mbers with target exer- cise intensities and recommended bouts of exercise and caloric expenditure to achieve improved health and weight loss; 2) A body composition station, where club members had their body fat tested and were given target body weight and caloric intake recommendations. Also, general dietary guidelines were pro- vided at this station; 3) A muscle strength and flex ibility assessment where, from the performance of some basic movements, EPO identified muscle stre ngth imbalances and flexibility issues that could lead to pain and musculoskeletal injuries. Exercise re commendations were provided to correct imbalances and poor flexibility; and, 4) Muscle power was esti mated from the UM copyrighted Chair Stand Power Test, which allowed us to predict the functional status of club members and risk of falls and disability in the future. Exercise recommendations to preserve powe r were provided at this station. The seminar was the first of many to come and was very well rece ived. Some club members called their families and had them come in to be tested. Even after the seminar had closed, students stayed around to provide more fitness assessments and advice to interested people. We believe that these health fitness seminars re- flect some key aspects of SOE's mission of promoting physical well-being in the community. Dr. Andy Gillentine of ESS was selected as the 2009 NASPE S port Management Outsta nding Achievement Award Winner. He will be at the AAHPERD Convention in Tampa where he will be honored on April 2nd for his accomplishments and contributions to NASPE/AAHPERD and the profession. In the News... Ms. Morgan Kirk , a School of Education alumna, was recogniz ed by the Golden Apple Program in Lee County, Florida. The Golden Apple is one of the top recognitions a teac her can receive. It is a community award given to the best and brightest teachers. Students, parents, and other members of the comm unity nominate the elemen- tary, middle, and high school teachers. After nominati on, a committee of volunteers narrows down the list after looking at the teachers' qualifications and reading each teac her's essay. Ms. Kirk of Fort Myers High School is 1 of 31 finalists selected for this prestigious award. Th e teachers will be interviewed and observed in their class- rooms and 6 finalists will be chosen. Dr. Beth Harry was featured in an article by Ana Veciana-Suarez in The Miami Herald on January 12, 2009. The story was about Beth and her daughter, whose short lif e became the inspiration for the book, Melanie: Bird with a Broken Wing. Beth told Veciana-Suarez that her book is a mother's story. \"It's about coming to terms with what she meant to us. I feel this huge sense of gratitude that her life proved meaningful for others an d that it motivated me to help oth- ers.\" Melanie had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy soon after bi rth. Beth was motivated by her daughter's struggles to found a non-profit school for special-needs children in Trinidad and Tobago. Melanie was in and out of hospitals for most of her five-and -a -half years, and Beth \"w ent on a pilgrimage to improve her daughter's life.\" As she continued her academic career after Melanie's deat h, Beth became a nationally recognized expert in spe- cial education, particularly in relation to the needs of mi nority children and their families. Beth is quoted as telling her university students that the biggest lesson s he hopes to impart is to respect parents and be willing to understand them, because the students \"have no idea what the parents are going through.\" Beth has returned to Trinidad only twice in the last 22 years. When she was there in De- cember of 2008, she was gratified to see t hat the school she had started with only 40 pre- schoolers had expanded and is now receivi ng long-sought government help. As she looked at the school she thought, perhaps with a mixture of sorrow and pride, \"Look at what Melanie's life has created.\" Dr. Brian Arwari - After working as an Adjunct Professor last se mester, Brian Arwari joined the Department of Exercise and Sport Sciences as a full-time lecturer of Sport Psychology and Psychophysiology in January 2009. Prior to working for U.M., he worked in Italy for the Univer sity of Rome as a researcher and part time Professor. Brian holds a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology and Psychophysi ology from the University of Rome, \"La Sapienza,\" which is one of the oldest and largest Universities in the world. New Faces... Former Elementary Ed. Graduate , Anjuli Pandit is now the director of a major \"Green\" project in Mumbai (formerly Bombay) in India that is funded by The Al Go re Foundation. She has a massive budget (US $15 million) and is doing amazing work - including setting up local schools for the young and \"catch-up\" classes for women who, on marriage, left education to keep house and bring up children, thus missing out on a university or college education. Anjuli was an outstanding teacher-in-training who had vision, energy, and commitment. She claimed, right from the beginning on her application, that GST (G lobal Student Teaching) wa s an experience she did not want to miss. Well, GST certainly changed her life. She now sends a Project Report - a sort of newsletter - every month. GST folk go on to do interesting and challenging th ings - and certainly this young woman has done just that! Female Athlete Triad by Dr. Arlette Perry Dr. Arlette Perry, Chair, Exercise and Sport Sciences, and Kysha Harriell, Director, Athl etic Training undergraduate program, presented a Symposium on the \"Female Athlete Triad\" on Saturday, December 6th, 2008. The symposium was part of the Latin American Confer- ence on Sports Medicine, Arthroscopy, Re- habilitation, and Exercise Physiology Se ries developed by Dr. Perry in conjunc- tion with the UHZ (Dr. John Uribe, Dr. Ke ith Hechtman, Dr. John Zvijac) team of Orthopedic Surgeons at HealthSouth Do ctors' Hospital. Physicians, nurses, therapists, trainers, and physiologists we re in attendance at the conference, which included over 150 participants repr esenting a dozen different nations from South and Central America. The confer- ence was so highly received that speakers are hoping to get support to bring the \"Female Athlete Triad\" symposium to the University of Miami for local participation by Varsity Athletic Coaches, Trainers, Therapists, and athletes alike. 1st Annual Sport Administration Sport Ethics Debate by Dr. Sue Mullane The first and hopefully annual sport administration sport ethics debate was held on December 4, 2008 at the Bank United Center Hurricane 100 Room. Partici-pants were Master's students in the Sport Administration program enrolled in Dr. Sue Mullane's ESS 574 class, \"Ethical Decision Making in Sport and the Professions.\" The idea was conceived from Dr. Mullane's concern that a few of her graduate students had already had her un- dergraduate ethics class and might need an extra aca- demic challenge in order to utilize what they already knew about ethics and specifically, sport ethics. These four students became the coaches of the four teams that were created very early in the semester. Teams con- sisted of six students. Since the sport administration graduate program is now mostly a one year program, an important goal of this project was to get the students to interact and work together early in their graduate pro-gram. Once the teams were formed, a case packet was dis- tributed to coaches and team members. Packets con-tained six cases and were researched and written by Dr. Mullane in consultation with the coaches. It was then the job of the coaches and team members to research each of the cases throughout the semester, assign responsi- bilities to each team member , create \"specialists\" on the teams for each case, and develop arguments for and against the ethical dilemma presented in the case. The students had to research and be prepared for all the cases, even though only three would be chosen in the actual debate. Prior to this, the students had learned ethical theories and decision making models in class lectures and discussions. Tips on research, debate strategies, and debate rules were also given to the stu- dents. The coaches met with Dr. Mullane each Monday morning for an update, and it was a pleasant surprise to learn how well the students were working and how seri-ously they were taking the upcoming debate. According to the coaches, strong bonds were being formed, and the students were becoming quite competitive. Every-thing seemed to be going as planned. Judges were selected. The judges were Dr. Shawn Post, Norman Parsons, Director of the Department of Wellness and Recreation, and Tim Mirabito, our sport administration undergraduate advisor and alumnus of our graduate program. They were sent the packets and rules prior to the debate and briefed about what would transpire. On the night of the actual debate, over 100 were in attendance, consisting mostly our undergraduate students, in addition to t he ESS faculty and chair, Dr. Perry. Emcee for the event was one of our graduate stu- dents, Ashley Woods, who might have missed her calling as a student athlete and st and-out volleyball player. It was clear who was in command, and she did a phe-nomenal job of keeping time and keeping the event run- ning smoothly. There were two initial rounds, with two teams debating in each, and the winners of each round debating in the final round. The cases were chosen by the judges. The cases were (1) the ethics of the LZR Swim Suit in the Olympics, (2) the ethics of horseracing and Eight Belles in the Kentucky Derby, and (3) the Alonzo Mourning Kid- ney transplant case. The teams each had names, and were extremely prepared and excellent debaters. Most importantly, the students ex hibited a keen mastery of ethics theories and moral reasoning techniques, in addi-tion to demonstrating their ability to apply theory to real life ethical dilemmas. They were dressed \"to the nines\" and as one observer noted, \"They looked like a bunch of Wall Street lawyers.\" The winning team received a gift certificate to a local restaurant, and it was later learned that they split it with t he other three teams. Indeed, a good time was had by all! From an academic perspec- tive, though, the best part was that the students showed a mastery of ethical reasoning and knowledge of how to apply what they learned in class to the \"real world.\" Can Evolutionary Theory Improve Childhood Education? If evolutionary theory were applied to public schools, several hours of playtime might be included in daily class-room schedules. Older children could teach youngsters, pass-ing along skills while building self-esteem. On a broader level, school districts might experiment with a variety of learning models to see which strategies were most effective. \"Modern evolutionary theory provides important tools for improving educational practices,\" said David Sloan Wilson, Distinguished Professor of Biology & Anthropology and Co-Director of the Evolution Institute at Binghamton University, State University of New York. \"It also helps us understand the process of human development outside the classroom in families and communities,\" Wilson moderated a Nov. 17 panel discussion on \"How Evolutionary Theory Can Improve Childhood Education\" as part of a three-day national conference hosted by the School of Education, sponsored by the Evolution Institute and supported by the Humanists of Florida Association. \"Our School's mission is to be a center of excellence in the promotion and integration of psychological, educational and physical development in multicultural communities,\" said Dean Isaac Prilleltensky. \"Evolutionary theory offers unique insights into how environments interact with individuals to produce - or to stop - desirable outcomes in early childhood education.\" Wilson noted that since Charles Darwin published his theory of natural selection in 1859, researchers have largely focused on the biological sciences, rather than evolution's role in the social sciences. \"Only now is this separation being broken down,\" he noted. \"This coming century will be a time of integration for all the human-related subjects.\" Although evolution has often been misinterpreted as a competition process that results in \"survival of the fittest,\" Wilson pointed out that cooperation, mutual respect, and other social skills are even more essential for human growth and development. Insights from evolutionary theory may help to im-prove early childhood education and address critical long-term community problems like poverty, crime, and teenage drug use, according to several panelists. \"Creating school environments that are nurturing and safe can bring down lev-els of aggressive behavior,\" said Anthony Biglan, Senior Sci-entist and Director, Oregon Research Institute and Center on Early Adolescence. \"When teachers feel less stress and are empowered to make choices based on their values, students can tell the difference.\" Reflecting on the nature of hunter-gatherer societies, both past and present, Peter Gray, Research Professor of Psychology, Boston College, said, \"These are very civilized groups of people, whose children are expected to share and behave kindly to each other. Their survival skills are learned and transmitted across generations.\" In contrast with modern schools, children in hunter-gatherer communities have little instruction from adults. In-stead, they learn primarily from older children in the context of play. \"Children need to feel empowered,\" Gray said, \"and that can come from a sense that you're helping other people. In age-mixed groups, for example, a 7-year-old might be some-what responsible for a 4-year-old sibling. I believe that age mixing is a natural environment for humans that reduces the potential for aggression and violence.\" David Bjorklund, Professor of Psychology, Florida Atlantic University, agreed with Gray and noted the socializa-tion process works both ways. \"A younger child can help a shy, older child stay connected to others in and outside the classroom,\" he said. Turning to mathematics, Daniel Berch, Dean for Re- search and Faculty Development, University of Virginia's Curry School of Education, focused on why some children struggle with numbers. \"Our brains were not evolved to deal with math concepts like fractions and decimals,\" he said. \"We know that putting more effort into the study of math can make a difference. But we don't know much about making the evo-lutionary transition from the basics like three cows or horses to more advanced concepts like three times four equals twelve.\" In a broader sense, applying the evolutionary proc- ess of natural selection can help school districts identify the most effective teaching and learning strategies for students, according to Bruce Ellis, Professor of Family Studies & Hu- man Development, University of Arizona. \"We should remem- ber there is no single answer - no one type of school - that will work for everyone. One of the lessons of evolutionary theory is that humans need multiple learning environments that encourage innovation and individual growth.\"For more information please visit the website, www.evolution.binghamton.edu/evos/MiamiWorkshop.html. From left, Anthony Biglan, Dean Isaac Prilleltensky, David Sloan Wilson and David Bjorklund Panel moderator David Wilson makes a point University of Miami Education Evaluation Team (UMEET) by Dr. Ann Bessel The University of Miami Education Evaluation Team (UMEET) is a successful, self -contained, full service pro- vider of evaluation services to community and academic groups. The team is directed by Dr. Ann G. Bessell. Due to the wide range of areas of expertise, the team is regularly sought by numerous public sc hool districts, governmental agencies, and community and professional organizations. Since its inception in 2004, UMEET has been supported 100% by extramural funding whic h to date has reached over $3,000,000. UMEET provides quality program evaluation ser- vices to local institutions in the state of Florida, as well as private institutions and comm unity, and non-profit organiza- tions throughout the United States. We have also engaged in collaborative consultation with professionals in the School of Medicine, Law, and Engineering. In addition, we assist in the feasibility of potential evaluations for educational en-deavors around the world. To provide the most effective and individual atten- tion to each one of our projects, the UMEETeam is divided into three different focused oriented teams: Non-Profit (PASS-Partnership to Advanc e School Success and CEC- Council of Educational Change), Community-Based (SunSmart America project, Kindergarten Support, Qual- ity Counts, and 21st CCLC-Century Community Learning Centers), and School-Based (SLC-Smaller Learning Com- munities, Cohorts 5, 6, and 8). Each team is facilitated by a project coordinator, and assisted by a lead data collector and a University of Miami stude nt worker and/or doctoral student. In addition, all teams work closely with a data ana- lyst and statistician; when n eeded, additional researchers, data collectors, and transcribers are engaged. All project evaluations are supervised by Dr. Bessell and budgets are monitored by a budget coordi nator-accountant. Because the UMEETeam is a multidisciplinary, multilingual, and multicul- tural group of people with different research and evaluation expertise, our work is cooperat ively done; in other words, any member of any team could be assisting, at some point in time, another team. Based on our work, particularly in inner cities and other urban areas, we have developed a number of innova-tive strategies for successfully meeting the challenge of pro- gram evaluation when dealing simultaneously with multiple student populations and a plethor a of school sites. We use logic models and conceptual frameworks to guide our evaluations. The knowledge, experience and abilities of our team members afford us flexibility in the type of methods (quantitative and/or qualitat ive approaches) and techniques employed within those method s, such as Photolanguage and Photovoice. These are uni que qualitative tools that have the capacity to stimulate and facilitate individuals' imagination, memory, and emotions, as well as to provide an opportunity for the person to articulate thoughts. Informa-tion that emerges from focus groups is often arranged using mind-mapping and spider diagrams to provide a graphic display of significant data points. Data on domains identified as critical to the success of a program are plotted to create a diagram to aid in interpretation and comparison. As we move forward, we continue to take a utiliza- tion-based perspective in order to build capacity in the or- ganizations we work with. We are not only committed to pro- vide quality evaluation services and participate in dissemi- nation efforts, but also strive to assist in the development of capacity-building skills needed for successful community, school-based, and non-profit organizations.

Youth Violence Prevention Dr. Wendy Cavendish participated in a presentation of a program/proc ess evaluation of the Palm Beach Youth Vio- lence Prevention Project (PBYVPP) to the Palm Beach Boar d of County Commissioners in June 2008. Dr. Cavendish is part of an evaluation team that includes faculty from Florida State University and t he Center for Criminology and Public Policy Research. The PBYVPP is a two million dolla r Palm Beach County funded initiative utilizing a gang and youth violence reduction model adapted from the Spergel Model (University of Chic ago) and the Office of Juvenile Jus- tice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). The initiative is bei ng implemented in five high violent crime cities within Palm Beach County. The components of the initiative include a four-pronged approach in each of the five cities. These include involvement from stakeholders in (1) law enforcement, (2) courts, (3) corrections, and (4) prevention which in- cludes the collaboration of the Palm Beach School Board, multiple community and grass roots agencies, and business partners to provide infrastructure and support for the devel opment of Youth Empowerment Centers (governed by com- munity teens) in five crime \"hot spots\" in each of the five cities. The five cities experienced varying levels of implement ation within the first year, but general findings were re- ported that include: The YVPP served 16,840 youth The teen councils of each Youth Empowerment Cent er (YEC) increased their self-determination skills (specifically, level of psychological empowerment an d goal setting/problem solving skills) through involve- ment in leadership activities related to the governance of the YECs. A reduction in the actual county-level rates of viol ent crime (murder, rape, and assault) compared to the \"projected\" levels (absent the progra m) during the project's first year These crime \"reductions\" (actual versus projected) duri ng the project's first year of operations resulted in an estimated economic impact of $4,377,730 COUNSELING PROGRAM HELPS RETURNING VETS FIND JOBS by Dr. Margret Crosbie-Burnett \"All they know how to do is carry a gun 24-7 and now they are home and are desperate for work. Half of them have PTSD; many have physical disabilities; most don't trust anyone and they run into all kinds of problems in the work environment. Can you help me?\" said Stephanie Dargoltz , a Master's student in Counseling whose practicum out- placement is one of Miami's Vet Centers, to Margaret Crosbie-Burnett last November. Dr . Crosbie-Burnett, who teaches Lifestyle and Career Counseling to Master's stude nts in Counseling, replied, \"I don't know anything about that population, so I will be on a steep learning curve, but I am grateful to have an opportunity to help our veterans.\" That was the beginning of a relationship between a prof essor-student team from the Counseling Programs and the Vet Center. Shanna Dulen , a doctoral student in Counseling Psychology, offered to join the team and lend her valuable experience working on basic job hunting skills with simi- lar populations. The goal of the series of sessions is to help the veterans find and keep jobs. The UM team helps the vets identify st rengths and skills, identify work settings that are prone to hiring veterans, reviews resumes, role plays job interviews, and provides general encouragement and problem-solving. Crosbie-Burnett reports, \"It is an emo-tional experience to see what war has done to these young minds and bodies. All we can do now is help them pick up the pieces and put them together in a way that will land them a job that will enable them to be productive and happy civilians.\" SOE Funded Grants PI Title Sponsor Start Date End Date Aldarondo, Etiony Immigrants Child ren's Legal FIAC 8/1/2008 7/31/2009 Complexity of Carnegie Foundation 8/1/2008 7/31/2009 Bessell, Ann Smaller Learning Communiti es- 1/2/2007 6/30/2009 Bessell, P&C of Houston 10/1/2003 9/30/2009 Corces, Teachers Roblee Foundation 6/17/2008 6/30/2009 Elbaum, Project 1/1/ Scotney Miami SPEC Youth Children's Trust 8/1/2008 7/31/2009 Marie Upward Boun d Program US DED 5/31/2009 Harry, Elizabeth OSEP Combined Priority DOE 9/1/2008 8/31/2009 Kevin Can Sildenafil Impr ove Exercise WADA 8/17/2007 8/16/2009 Lee, APA Incid ent Reading DED Mathemati cs Foundat ion 8/1/2008 8/1/2010 TAL Master's Program Update The Early Childhood Special Education master's program w ent through a quiet change of hands when Dr. Beth Harry be- came the new Program Director at the beginning of the y ear.

Twenty-two years later, we cont inue strong with the recent award for t he tuition support grant offered by the Office of Special Educ ation Programs (OSEP). CRESPECD (\"Culturally Responsive Professionals in Early Childhood Disabilities\") is the acrony m for the most recent project under the direction of Dr. Beth Harry and coordinat ion of Maria Papazian. The first cohort of 12 students was recruited, admitted and enrolled with the assistance of seve ral members of the SOE family, especially Patty Capps, Tinisha Hollinshead, and Marissa Stevenson (listed alphabetic ally). Students will be participating in the two practical experiences in the Summer 2009 sessions and their an ticipated graduation date is set for May 2010. CRESPECD does not spell Respect, but it is pronounced Respect. It is the goal of CRESPECD to introduce master's candidates to the full range of Part B and Part C services. Field ex- periences in both areas will result in Early Childhood Specia l Educators who are well prepared to have a more holistic view of the needs of young children and their families. Furt her, the program provides a model of professional collabo- ration by interfacing with key agencies serving young children with, and at-risk for, disabilities in Miami-Dade County, and by requiring students to participate in several activities with families from a range of ethnic and socio-economic circumstances. Thus, through both University based and commu nity based activities, Master's candidates will learn not only how to collaborate with families and other service prov iders, but will also gain firs thand experience of key agen- cies in their community.

Richter Library, University of Miam i, served as the publication's associate editor. Below is a list of the faculty and graduate student articles (as they appear) which are included in the encyclopedia. In many respects, they represent an index of the interests and research areas of the School's faculty and students in the area of School and Society: Lina Lopez Chiappone, \"Adaptive Tech Education,\" Issues English Language Learners,\" Juliet Hart, \"Least Restrictive Environment,\" Juliet Hart, \"Mainstreaming\" in Pr ovenzo, Jr. E.

Below is a description of some of the projects. If you are interest ed in learning more about these projects, send an email to nguerda@miami.edu The Kalula Project (Kalula means one who will succeed, achieve, accomplish) In partnership with the Thelma Gibson Health Initiative in Coconut Grove with the support of a grant from the Chil- dren's Trust, the Kalula project is a culturally enriched tutoring and mentoring program for elementary, middle, and high school students in the Coconut Grove area. The vision of the Kalula project is to implement a culturally enriched tutoring and mentoring program for Black students in Miami-D ade. The Kalula Project aims at using an Afrocentric mentoring approach to enhance the academic skills and cu ltural awareness of Black students in Miami-Dade. Women of Color Diary Project In partnership with EPS faculty member Dr. Debbiesiu Lee, we are creating a web-based project t hat highlights video clips of women discussing their experiences with \"isms\" and ways that they cope with t hese experiences. This is a pilot project that will be conducted with approximately 20 wo men, and we hope to expand this project with funding. The goal of the project is to for women across the globe to share their experiences with each other in an effort to de- velop skills and strategies to effectively cope and manage the day-to-day experiences that many women encounter with \"isms\" in their lives. Children of Color Diary Project Similar to the women of color diary project, this is a web- based intervention project that focuses on the experiences of children and adolescents of color in their schools and community settings. With permission from parents and or guardians, children and adolesce nts are creating video clips of themselves discussing their experiences with a variety of different issues such as racism, discrimination, prejudice , sexuality, religion, etc. In addition, a group of children and adolescents is also being trained or will be trained on how to conduct interviews with their peers on these topics. These clips will be uploaded on the website along with reso urces for how to cope and manage these experiences. Similar to the YouTube concept, individuals will have an oppor tunity to also upload their individual videos, which will be screened prior to being published on the website. Taking Action Against Racism in K-12 Schools Every day, children as young as 5 years are experiencing ra cism from peers, teachers, and school administrators in their school environment. Daily occurrences of racism or ra cial microaggressions negatively affect self-esteem, iden- tity, and academic success children and Capodilupo, Torino, Bucceri, Holder, Nadal, & Esquilin, 2007).Such experiences also impact the students' retention, and engagement in their learning. In collaboration with some colleagues representing different geographical location s in the United States, educators, psychologists, commu- nity leaders, etc. are docum enting the experiences of children in K-12 scho ols with racism, documenting interventions that are combating racism in the schools, and developing additi onal strategies for reducing the racial experience and impact on children.

Welcome to the new Dunsp augh-Dalton Community and Educational Well-Being Research Center! By Dr. Etiony Aldarondo, Director, Dunspaugh-D alton Community and Educational Well-Being Re- search Center It is with great pleasure that we announce that on January 29th President Shalala, upon the recommen- dation of the Faculty Senate, appr oved the the Duns paugh-Dalton Community and Educa- tional Well-Being Research Center (CEW). As many of you know, the CEW is a central piece of our strategic plan and an important component for the real ization of the SOE's mission to produce knowl- edge and train the next generation of leaders, researchers, and agents of change in education and the community. The vision of the CEW is to become an in ternational and interdisciplinary center for the study and promotion of community and educational we ll-being. The CEW's mission is threefold: to un- derstand educational, psychological, physical and social problems; to seek ways to prevent these problems; and to promote well-being in individuals, relationships, organizations, and communities through interdisciplinary research, university-comm unity partnerships, professional development, and consultation. The establishment of the CEW synergizes with ongoi ng SOE research efforts. The Center addresses a need within our school for infrastructure and technica l support. It will facilitat e integrative scholarship and the development of large-scale re search projects. The CEW will provide an interdisciplinary home for faculty and trainees in the Scho ol of Education as they pursue t heir research. CEW will provide a base from which to collaborate with faculty in other University of Miami schools and colleges with re- lated research interests. "}
