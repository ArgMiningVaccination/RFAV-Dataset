SECTION TWO DNV Accreditation & ISO Certification DNV is our accreditation organization. Each year, DNV conducts surveys using its NIAHO standards to determine our compliance with Center for Medicare /Medicaid Services ' Conditions of Participation (COP). Passing accreditation surveys is a requirement for reimbursement for Medicare . SECTION THREE HIPAA Regulations The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law which protects the privacy of patients and all information about them. Violating these laws may result in civil and/or criminal penalties and result in termination. Therefore, any information you may see or hear must not be shared with others. PHI Protected Health Information (PHI) is defined as any information that can be used to identify a patient, whether living or deceased. It relates to the patient' s past, present or future mental health or condition including healthcare services provided and the payment of those services. PHI Examples : Medical records, problem logs, photographs, videotapes and billing records. Treat confidential information with the utmost care as it should only be accessed, used or disclosed for legitimate business -related treatment, payment or health care operational purposes. If you access PHI without consent or without a job -related reason for doing so, you may be violating HIPAA AND Lee Health policy. 2022 Education Guide Page 5 Camera Cell Phones Use of cameras on cell phones is not permitted while on duty because they pose a risk to patient privacy, and the privacy and security of protected health information . Workstations Don't logon and let someone else use the system with your logon ID . You are responsible for all activities during each of your computer sessions. If you are given password access to a Lee Health computer, keep it confidential and do not share it with anyone or keep it where others ca n find it. Never leave your workstation unattended unless it has been locked or it is logged off. Avoid clicking on unexpected or suspicious links in an email as we are not immune to cyber -attacks and phishing (when an email appears to be from a reputable source, to lure individuals into revealing sensitive data such as user names, passwords, etc.) . Compliance & Business Ethics The Lee Health Compliance Program was developed to promote full and continued compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations including those related to participation in government health care programs and the Florida Code of Ethics. Hotline Individuals at Lee Health may report compliance questi ons or concerns using the Compliance Hotlin e. The Hotline is available 24/7 , and any caller may choose to remain anonymous. Employees and volunteer s are encouraged to follow the chain of command first. Gifts Sometimes patients or their family members want to express their appreciation by offering gifts. Gifts such as candy, flowers, gift cards may be accepted up to a value of $25. Gifts of cash or cash gift cards should never be accepted. SECTION FOUR Patient Safety Reports A Patient Safety Report must be completed whenever an event occurs which causes (or could cause) harm to a patient. For example: Falls Equipment failure or misuse of equipment which causes (or could cause) injury Who should complete the Patient Safety Report? The person who witnesses an event should initiate the Patient Safety R eport as soon as possible. Please contact public safety/security, your department supervisor or volunteer resources to file a report. 2022 Education Guide Page 6 Notice of Injury Report A Notice of Injury form must be completed if a volunt eer or employee is injured. These forms can be filled out in the Employee Health Office or the Emergency Department during off hours. Once the completed document is received it is sent to Work ers' Compensation for review and follow-up. If you are involved in an accident or injury, we also ask that you contact Volunteer Resources so we are aware. The employee/volunteer may be required to submit to drug and alcohol testing . SafeLee Error-Prevention Tools At Lee Health, we exercise safe b ehaviors every day by using SafeLee Error -Prevention Tools. 1. Clarifying Questions - we encourage volunteers to ask questions. 2. C.U.S.: I'm Concerned; I'm Uncomfortable; Stop! - use CUS should you find yourself in a situation that may put you or others at a risk. 3. Our LEE HEALTH Safety Absolute - Red Rule : Two Patient Identifiers - in order to avoid errors and harm caused by misidentification, it is a System -wide expectation that every Lee Health team m ember will match and verify two patient identifier s. Every Patient > Every Time . The reliable patient identifiers include: 1. Patient's FULL Name 2. Date of Birth (verbalize month, day, and year) SECTION FIVE Risk Management Risk Management seeks to identify, reduce or eliminate actual and potential sources of risk, as well as to minimize damages. Caring behaviors, such as good communication with patients and their families, increases the likelihood of compliance with treatment, good outcomes and a po sitive patient experience. It is important to encourage patients and families to tell us whenever they are concerned, upset or unhappy with their care . Guest Services and Risk Management staff are available to help if needed. Risk and Volunteers Volunte ers should perform only duties within their assigned job description. Licensed professional (retired or active) may not perform licensed functions as a volunte er. Lee Health will cover volunte ers under the liability policy when performing within the scope of the defined volunte er job descriptio n. Volunteer Protection Act Florida Statute: \"Any person who volunt eers to perform any service for any nonpro fit organizatio n, including an officer or director of such organization, without comp ensation from the nonpro fit organization, regardless of whether the person is receiving compensation from another source, except reimbursement for actual expenses, shall be considered an agent of such nonpro fit organization when acting within the scope of any official duties performed under such volunt eer services. Such person, and the source of any such comp ensation, if the volunte er is not acting 2022 Education Guide Page 7 as an agent of the sourc e, shall incur no civil liability for any act or omission by such person which results in personal injury or property damage if: a. Such person was acting in good faith within the scope of any official duties performed under such volunte er service and such person was acting as an ordinary reasona bly prudent person would have acted under the same or similar circumstances; and b. The injury or damage was not caused by any wanton or willful misconduct on the part of such person in the performance of such dutie s.\" Sexual Abuse Prevention and Reporting To protect patients from sexual abuse and provide for reporting of sexual misconduct in accordance with Florida law, immediately report any allegation or suspicion of sexual misconduct made against any member of the facility's staff to the Risk Management Department and the Security Department. After regular business hour s (Monday - Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) contact the operator to page the Risk Manager on call. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) EMTALA is a federal law created in 1985 to ensure access to quality healthcare for everyone. The law was put into place to protect people who were being rejected by healthcare professionals. EMTALA is easy to violate and stiff fines can be levied when a violation occurs. It is important for you to understand EMTALA and to help us ensure we do not violate the law. Should you come across someone who enters the hospita l looking for medical attention, your responsibilities include the following: Get help if needed . Assist the patient to the ED. Simply giving directions is NOT sufficient. Call a NURSE STAT if the p atient cannot be moved. The responding team will treat and move the patient to the ED for the medical screening to occur and transfer , if necessary . If an individual is seeking care for a medical condition on hospital property, never say or do anything that would encourage them to leave the hospital property to seek care somewhere else. Sometimes individuals will ask how long the wait is and under those circumstances you can respond to the question, but please make sure to encourage the person to stay and be seen in the emergency department. An individual may decide they do not want to wait and that is acceptable as long as they make the decision on their own. Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation Abuse can be child or elder abuse, intimate partner abuse (domest ic violence) or abuse from an assault. Any person who has reasonable cause to suspect abuse, neglect, or exploitation shall immediately report knowledge, or suspicion to the department leader and/or public safety. 2022 Education Guide Page 8 SECTION S IX Diversity -> DiverseLee Lee Health is a community that puts diversity and inclusion into practice. At Lee Health, we work together to achi eve positive results. For Diversity resources, and Diversity and Cultural Responsiveness call 239-424-3806. Discrimination, Harassment, Retaliatio n In accordance with Lee Health Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation Policy discrimination, harassment or retaliation of any individual on the basis of any protected category will not be tolerated. If you have observed, or if you believe you are the victim of discrimination, harassment or retaliation, speak to the harasser, and clearly request the offending behavior to stop. If the behavior does not stop, or if you are not comfortable speaking to the harasser, c ontact your leader, and/or Volunteer Resources. Patient Discriminatory Bias Any patient request or demand based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age or disability is an unlawful discriminatory bias. If you experience direct discriminatory bias from a patient who requests that you comply with a demand that appears to be based on discriminatory reasons, y ou should alert your supervisor. Disability Awareness We are required by law to ensure that patients, visitors and guests with disabilities can fully and equally access services and facilities at Lee Health.

A service animal is trained to perform work or tasks for the benefit of the individual. 2022 Education Guide Page 9 SECTION S EVEN Hand Hygiene Hand hygiene is the single -most important means of preventing the spr ead of infections to yourself or others. Hand washing, using either a system -approved soap and running water or an alcohol hand gel, helps prevent the spread of infection. It is important that we prompt each other to wash hands if an opportunity has been missed, and patients or visitors should be empowered to remind their caregivers about hand hygiene as well. Clean hands save lives! Alcohol Gel (hand sanitizer) - after touching services such wheelchairs, keyboards and equipment, before putting on gloves and after removing them Use a full pump of gel - as that is the determined optimal amount for proper Hand Hygiene Rub hands together, covering all surfaces of the hands and fingers Continue rubbing u ntil hands are completely dry - don't wipe on clothes Traditional Hand Washing - when hands are visibly soiled and after using the restroom and before and after eating Soap and warm water (proven to cause less irritation to the skin) Rub hands together w ith friction for a minimum of 20 seconds Rinse hands thoroughly to remove all the soap Gently pat hands to completely dry with paper towels Use paper towels to turn off the faucet and open the bathroom door Artificial Nails are NOT permitted for volunteers or employees who have direct patient contact. This includes: exte nders, overlays, wraps, acrylics, tips, tapes or other appliques. These products have been proven to harbor germs and are a danger to patients. Perfumes/Cologne/Scented lotions can cause discomfort to those with severe allergies and breathing issues. Please refrain from using strong scents when volunteering, especially in patient care areas. Standard Precautions, Transmission -Based Precautions Standard Precautions are infection co ntrol procedures used in the care of ALL patients to prevent contact with blood, mucous membranes or any infectious material. Standard Precaution practices include good hand hygiene, cough etiquette, wound coverage and the use of appropriate personal prote ctive equipment (PPE) for any contact with soiled or contaminated matter. During the pandemic we use eye protection for all patient encounters . Transmission -Based Precautions will be cle arly marked for your protection. When you see a stop sign hanging fr om the top of the door frame of a patient's room , DO NOT ENTER the room. The sign means the patient may be contagious or be immunocompromised. Check at nurses' station if you need assistance. 2022 Education Guide Page 10 Viral Respiratory Illness Influenza and other viral respiratory diseases can become serious enough to require hospitalization, and in some instances, can cause death. Vaccination for influenza is the primary strategy to prevent infection, or to reduce risk of severe influenza disease. ALL Employees and Volunteers are required to get a flu vaccine or qualify for an exemption annually by the designated deadline. Volunteers may apply for an exemption for medical re asons or for religious/strongly -held personal beliefs or convictions. Stay Home When Sick Please s tay home a nd call your supervisor if you are experiencing fever or symptoms of COVID including: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea. COVID-19 During pandemic conditions, ALL peopl e in Lee Health facilities are required to wear a mask and/or eye protection (except for patients who would be harmed by doing so). Prevention practices for Viral Respiratory I llness Wash hands frequently Avoid touching eyes, nose, face and mouth Do not come to work when you are sick Always use appropriate PPE (mask and protective eyewear when in patient care areas.) Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that usually affects the lungs. TB germs may be spread when a person who has the active disease coughs, sneezes, laughs, sings or even talks. Employees and Volunteers are required to complete an annual TB questionnaire which is used to screen for TB (according to updated CDC guideline). If the s creening questionnaire has positive answers, further testing is done to determine whether the person has active or inactive TB infection. Sharps Safety The use of needles, scalpels and other sharp objects is common in the healthcare setting. Volunteers SHO ULD NEVER handle sharps or needles. If a needle stick or exposure to a sharp does occur, it is vital to follow these steps : 1. Wash your hands and the area affected with soap and water 2. Report incident to supervisor 3. Report immediately to Employee Health or Emergency Department for a confidential medical evaluation. Employee Health will conduct follow -up counseling. Notice of Injury/Illness Form will be completed during that time. NOTE - All needle sticks/blood exposures that occur at times when Employee Heal th is closed must report to the Emergency Department for a medical evaluation . 2022 Education Guide Page 11 SECTION EIGHT Hazardous Materials Employees and v olunteers need to be aware of and have a right to know about the hazardous chemicals stored or used in their work place. For access to the material safety data sheets, please contact the Volunteer Resources Office or your Department Supervisor. They will be able to provide the information. HCS Pictograms and Hazards USING LABELS To make it easier to recognize a chemical or hazardous material's potential dangers, the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) uses hazard- specific icons. There are eight used at Lee Health. HCS PICTOGRAMS AND HAZARDS Health Hazard Carcinogen Mutagenicity Reproductive Toxicity Respiratory Sensitizer Target Organ Toxicity Aspiration Toxicity Flam e Flammables Pyrophorics Emits Flammable Gas Self-Reactives (skin and eye) Skin Sensitizer Acute Toxicity (harmful) Narcotic Effects Respiratory Tract Irritant Hazardous to Ozone Layer (Non-Mandatory) Compresse d Gas Gases Under Pressure Corrosiv e Skin Corrosion/Burns Eye Damage Corrosive to Metals Explosiv e Explosives Self-Reactives Organic Peroxides Oxidize r Oxidizers Toxi c Acute Toxicity (fatal or toxic) 2022 Education Guide Page 12 Compressed Gas Cylinder Guidelines Oxygen gas cylinders (tanks) can pose safety hazards if not operated and transported properly. The contents of full gas cylinders ar e compressed to a pressure of 20 00 pounds per square inch. That amount of pressure is capable of prop elling the metal cylinder with explosive force if its ' integrity is breached due to being dropped or otherwise mis used. It is essential all volunteers handling any compressed gas cylinders be trained and have documented competencies established prior to us ing cylinders without supervision. Radiation Safety Guidelines To keep radiation exposure to a minimum (or As Low As Reasonably Achievable), respect the yellow and purple or yellow and black radiation/radioactive material signs posted prominently on doors and containers: CAUTION RADIATION AREA CAUTION HIGH RADIATION AREA CAUTION RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS CAUTION 'AIRBORNE' RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS Entering these areas requires special permission.
