To get these, a doctor must give you a prescription or send a prescription to the pharmacy. Prescription drugs should be taken only by the patient they are prescribed for.

A: They can be found in pharmacies, grocery stores, discount stores, airports, and gas stations. Some examples include Advil (ibuprofen), an anti-inflammatory (calcium carbonate), a stomach acid reducer. Q: Is it cheaper to buy a medication over-the-counter? A: Not always. OTC medications are generally not covered by health insurance plans and can be expensive. It may be easier to buy OTC medication if you do not have insurance that covers prescriptions. However, it may not be cheap. Buying store brands (generic medications) and using coupons may help to lower costs. For example, it is cheaper to buy store brand ibuprofen than it is to buy Advil because ibuprofen is the generic version. You can always ask the pharmacist if you are choosing the least expensive option. Medicare Part D covers prescriptions, and sometimes it may cost less to buy medication with a prescription. Getting a prescription, however, usually requires a visit to a healthcare provider and may not be as easy as buying an OTC medication. Q: My doctor warned me about taking certain OTC products. Do manufacturers list the generic name of the drug on their products? A: The generic drug name is not always listed where you can easily find it. Usually, it is listed in the ACTIVE ingredients section in small print on the back of the medication bottle or box. The FDA asks manufacturers to clearly label the generic name of the drug or active ingredients and the purpose of the product on the Drug Facts label. However, it is not required to list the names of drugs that would have similar effects. This information can be obtained from your pharmacist or healthcare provider and will help you avoid taking too much of the same or similar medications which can cause side effects. For example, if you are taking Celebrex (celecoxib), a prescription for arthritis, and Advil or Motrin IB, which contain ibuprofen, you could increase your risk for stomach or kidney trouble. Q: If a drug is available over-the-counter, does it have fewer side effects than a prescription drug? A: Not always. OTC products still cause side effects, drug interactions, and disease interactions. These medicines may worsen your condition or they may cause another drug you are taking to build up in your body. For example, men with an enlarged prostate may have difficulty urinating if they take OTC decongestants (such as phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine) or antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine). Q: Do I need to tell my healthcare provider about my use of OTC medications and herbal and nutritional supplements? A: Yes, it is important to tell your healthcare provider and pharmacist about your use of these products. They will be able to help you choose the right medicine for your condition or symptom. Your healthcare providers will also need to check for interactions with other drugs you may be taking or drugs they are considering prescribing for you. Sometimes vitamins and supplements interact with medicine too. You can help your provider by bringing in all prescription, OTC, or herbal/nutritional medicines you are taking to your office visits. This is so problems can be identified and prevented. Last Updated June 2019 "}
