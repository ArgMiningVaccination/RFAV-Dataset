Healthy food choices before, during and after pregnancy can help you stay healthyand well. This will also help your baby grow healthy and strong. Healthy eatingduring pregnancy may also protect your baby against diseases in later life. Use the food pyramid below to help you choose healthy eating options which are good for you and for baby. Further information is available on: healthpromotion.ie and search 'pregnancy' . page | 4alcohol There is no known safe level of alcohol use in pregnancy - so stopping completely is best. Further information is available on: www.yourdrinking.ie Taking Medicine Research shows that over-the-counter medicines you use in pregnancy caninfluence your child later in life. Even medicines that don't seem to do you anyharm may be damaging to your baby. Take as few medicines as possible, andonly where the benet from taking them outweighs the risk. Always tell any doctor, dentist, midwife or pharmacist that you are pregnant. Remember to seek advice from your health professional before taking anymedication or alternative therapies in pregnancy. Further information is available on: www.drugs.ie Smoking Stopping smoking is the single most important thing you can do to protectyour health. If you are pregnant, giving up will help protect your baby's healthtoo. Cork University Hospital is a smoke-free campus which means thatsmoking is not permitted anywhere on the grounds including all the areasaround Cork University Maternity Hospital. This includes doorways, walkways,car parks, internal roads and bike sheds. It may be helpful to contact your GP in advance of your stay at Cork University Maternity Hospital for advice on smoking cessation support options or nicotine replacement therapy. Further information is available on: www.quit.ie and search 'pregnancy'page | 5Depression during pregnancy Most women have mood swings during pregnancy. This is perfectly normal. However, if you are constantly feeling down, angry or anxious, this may bemore than a temporary blip and might need more careful attention. If you feelthat you are slipping into depression, talk to your GP or midwife at the ante-natal clinics. If you already have mental health problems, you are more likelyto become ill again during pregnancy, or in the rst year after giving birth,than at other times in your life. Sometimes people who have a mental healthproblem stop taking their medication. If you do this without talking to yourGP or midwife when you become pregnant, this can make your illness returnor get worse, so it's important to talk to them rst. From the minute you know you are pregnant, your feelings change: feelings about yourself, about your baby and about your future. Your relationshipchanges: with your partner, other children and also with your parents andfriends. Dealing with these changes is not always easy. If you are feelingconcerned or anxious - for whatever reason - talk to your midwife or doctoras soon as possible. Further information is available on: www.hse.ie/healthaz and see 'P' , 'postnatal depression' . Sexual health Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) often have no symptoms, so you maynot know if you have one. However, many STIs can aect your baby's healthduring pregnancy and after the birth. If you have any reason to believe that you or your partner may have an STI, go for a check-up as soon as possible. You can ask your GP or midwife, or, if youprefer, go to a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or sexual health clinic. Further information is available on: www.thinkcontraception.iepage | 6Sex during pregnancy You can have sex during pregnancy. Your partner's penis can't penetrate beyond your vagina, and the baby cannot tell what's going on. It is normalfor your sex drive to change during pregnancy though. Don't worry aboutthis, but do talk about it with your partner. Your midwife or doctor willprobably advise you to avoid sex if you've had any heavy bleeding inpregnancy, since sex may increase the risk of further bleeding if the placentais low. We will advise you to avoid sex if your waters have broken (rupture of membranes) as this can increase the risk of infection. If you're unsure, ask yourmidwife or doctor Further information is available on: www.nhs.uk/conditions and search 'sex in pregnancy' . activity and exercise The more active and t you are during pregnancy, the easier it will be for youto adapt to your changing shape and weight gain. It will also help you to dealwith labour and get back into shape after the birth. Keep up your normal daily physical activity or exercise (walking, pilates, swimming, yoga or even just walking to the shops and back) for as long asyou feel comfortable. Exercise is not dangerous for your baby - there is someevidence that active women are less likely to experience problems in later pregnancy and labour. Further information is available on: www.hse.ie/healthaz . Expecting more than one baby- multiple pregnancy Classes are available at CUMH, tailored specically for women/couples expecting twins, triplets or more. When you are expecting more than one baby it is nice to meet others at these classes who are in a similar situation. The Irish Multiple Births Association has a helpful booklet and it is available on: www.imba.iepage | 7Teenage Parents Becoming a mum or dad is a pretty big deal, but being a teen mum or dad can be even more of a challenge. From the time you nd out that there is ababy on the way, there are many things you might want to nd out. As partof our Preparation for Birth and Parenthood Education programme, CUMHruns a special information session for teenagers and young adults expectinga baby. You can also nd lots of information to help you become the best mum or dad you can be on the website: www.teenparents.ie/iopen24 Domestic Violence Domestic violence can be described as \"The use of physical or emotional forceor threat of physical force, including sexual violence, in close adultrelationships...the term 'domestic violence' goes beyond actual physicalviolence. It can also involve emotional abuse, the destruction of property,isolation from friends, family and other potential sources of support, threatsto others including children, stalking, and control over access to money,personal items, food, transportation and the telephone. Pregnancy does not oer protection from domestic violence. In fact, international research has found that 30% of women who experiencedomestic violence are physically assaulted for the rst time during pregnancy. The Rotunda Hospital, Dublin conducted research which found that one in eight women surveyed were being abused during their current pregnancy. It is recognised that the birth of a baby can be a stressful time. Social workers based at Cork University Maternity Hospital provide a counselling and support service for expectant parents. They work closely with other professionals both within the hospital and with those based in the community. If you wish to speak to a social worker, please ask your midwife or doctor who will make contact with the department on your behalf.

Pleaseconsult your midwife or doctor to discuss any concerns that you may have.Below is a list of various discomforts and illnesses that may come up duringyour pregnancy. These include constipation, piles, heartburn and indigestion,varicose veins, stretch marks, thrush, vaginal discharge and incontinence. For more information see: 'pregnancy care' on www.hse.ie/healthaz Irish Maternity Early Warning System (IMEWS) CUMH has an early warning system in place to pick up any change in yourcondition. This system is used along with clinical assessment to detect anychange in your condition to improve the decision making about the care youmay need if you are ill during pregnancy or in the rst 42 days following thebirth of your baby/babies. For further information symptoms such as frequency and urgency can be common in early pregnancy, up to 18 weeks and after 30 weeks. This is due to pressure fromthe uterus in the pelvis. Urinary incontinence on exertion is common as yourpelvic floor muscles relax from the hormonal changes of pregnancy andincreased pelvic pressure. A pelvic floor muscle exercise programme, avoiding excessive weight gain, constipation and heavy lifting will help. If the problem has existed since your last pregnancy, is severe, or you have other bladder problems outside of pregnancy please contact the Continence Advisory Service in Cork University Maternity Hospital at 021 4920761.page | 10Pregnancy Related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) or Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction (SPD) is a common condition in pregnancy. Between 50 and 70% of pregnantwomen experience pain in the pelvic joints or lower back during pregnancy.Women experience dierent symptoms and these are more severe in somewomen than others. If you understand how PGP may be caused, and how youcan help yourself, this may lessen the impact of PGP on your life. Thesymptoms of PGP are often felt over the pubic bone at the front, below yourtummy or across one or both sides of your lower back or buttock. Symptoms You may have diculty: lWalking; lTaking weight on one leg at a time e.g. climbing stairs, dressing or gettinginto or out of the bath; lParting your legs for example getting in and out of the car; lWith hip movements for example turning in bed; lLying on your back or side; or lWith normal movement activities of daily life. Causes of Pelvic Girdle Pain It may be a combination of factors for example the ligaments around yourpelvis can have increased laxity due to your pregnancy hormones. This can lead to increased or uneven movement in your pelvis. This extra movementin itself can cause pain. As your baby grows, your posture changes. This leadsto a change in the activity of the muscles of your tummy, pelvic girdle, hipsand pelvic floor. This can increase the strain on your lower back and pelvis. Due to increased movement in the joints of your pelvis and the change in muscle activity this can cause mal-alignment of the pelvic girdle joints. Thiscan be a source of pain and discomfort. If you have a history of back pain your symptoms may worsen during pregnancy. Occasionally women experience pain due to the position of their baby.page | 11General tips for preventing or managing Pelvic Girdle Pain Standing Changes in your posture occur as you carry the weight of your baby at thefront. This changes the position of your centre of gravity. Sometimes, the curve in the small of your back increases and your shoulders become more rounded. This can place extra strain on your lower back or yourpelvis.Your tummy muscles can help lift and support the weight of your baby.This can reduce the strain on your back and pelvis. To feel these musclesworking, place your hands on your lower tummy, below your belly button.Breathe in normally and as you breathe out gently pull your tummy musclesin, away from your hands, a very small amount. Hold your tummy muscles ingently as you continue to breathe. Practice tightening your lower tummy muscles when you walk and stand. This will ease the strain on your lower back and pelvis. Always maintain equalweight through both feet. Avoid putting weight onto one leg only. Wearcomfortable flat supportive shoes. Rest when you can - you may need to restand sit more often. Sit to get dressed and undressed. activities of daily living lBe as active as possible within your pain limits and avoid activities that make the pain worse. lTake the stairs one step at a time. lWhen going upstairs try leading with the less painful leg. lGoing downstairs, try leading with the more painful leg and use the banister for support. lTry to avoid lifting heavy things or doing heavy housework such as vacuuming. lWhen lifting bend your knees and keep your back straight rather than stooping over. lYou may nd it easier to sit when doing some house work such as ironing or preparing vegetables. lTake care when pushing a heavy shopping trolley. lAvoid turning quickly as this can strain your pelvis. Instead move slowly as you turn. lAsk for or accept help with your daily work.page | 12If you have toddlers or small children lAvoid lifting them as much as you can. lKneel down to comfort them or sit and let them climb up to you instead of lifting. lWhen lifting a small child bend your knees and keep your back straight. lLet them climb into the car seat themselves if they can. lAvoid bending or stooping as this places strain on your lower backand pelvis. lKneel down or place them at a height where you can stand or sit when caring for them. SittingSitting, slouching or sitting very straightcan strain your back and pelvis. Aim forhalfway between these two positions. Placing a small support such as a cushion or rolled up towel at your lower back can help to avoid slouching. Sit well back into the chair and take its full support. Don'tperch on the edge as your muscles will tire more quickly. If using a computer bring your chair under the desk or the keyboard closer soyour arms can rest by your side as youtype. Adjust the monitor so it is at eyelevel. When driving, adjust your seat so that your arms can rest by your side as you turn the wheel. This helps prevent slouching. When getting in and out of thecar, move your legs in and out in stages rather than one big movement. page | 13Sleeping You may nd lying on your side with a pillowbetween your knees comfortable. As your pregnancy progresses, placing an additional pillow under your bump may prevent strain on yourhips and low back. To turn in bed easily, bend your knees up, pull in your tummy muscles and keep your knees together. Turn,moving your shoulder and hip together in onemovement. If you nd your hips are sore or achingthis may be because your mattress is very rm.Doubling over a single duvet and placing itunderneath you, can help to relieve this. To get outof bed, roll onto your side and drop your legs over theedge of the bed. Use your elbow and hands to pushyour body into a sitting position. When you want toget in to bed reverse this procedure. During Labour The majority of women with PGP cope very well with a vaginal birth. We willgive you an information leaflet on managing PGP during labour and birth. Further information is available on: www.cuh.hse.ie and search 'Pelvic Girdle Pain' . page What is the carpal tunnel? The carpal tunnel is a narrow passage in your wrist made up of small bonesand a tough band of tissue. Several tendons and your 'median nerve' runthrough the tunnel to supply movement and sensation to your ngers. What is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)? CTS is a condition where the median nerve in the hand becomes compressedat the wrist. Symptoms of CTS occur when the median nerve becomes'pinched' by pressure within the tunnel. What causes CTS? Fluid retention in pregnancy increases the pressure in your carpal tunnel.Symptoms are made worse if your wrist is bent for long periods of time e.g.prolonged use of a computer keyboard. If you had similar, milder symptoms prior to pregnancy there may be other causes for this. Please discuss this with your GP or physiotherapist. What are the symptoms of CTS? lTingling or numbness in a part of your hand (thumb, index, middle or ring ngers); lSharp pains that shoot from your hand or wrist up along the arm; lBurning sensations in your ngers; objects; and lWaking at night with hand pain and numbness. Your symptoms will tend to be worse at night or rst thing in the morning. This is because you are unaware of what position your hands are in when youare asleep. They may have been bent for a period of time causing pressure on the nerve. We will give you a splint to wear at night to prevent you frombending your wrist and compressing the nerve.page | 15What can I do to help improve the symptoms of CTS? Remember PRIME (Positioning, Rest, Ice, Movement, Elevation). Positioning - Avoid bending your wrists for prolonged periods of time e.g. typing at a keyboard. When doing any activities with your hands, such as typing, try and keep your hands in a supported neutral position. Wear yoursplint particularly at night. Change the position of your hands regularly. Rest - Minimise any activities that make your symptoms worse. Take regular work breaks if you are doing a manual task.Ice- When your symptoms flare up, cooling your wrists can help relieve your symptoms. Run your wrists under the cold tap. Use a cold compress, such as an ice pack or ice wrapped in a towel. Do not apply ice directly to your skin asit can cause an ice burn. Movement - Gentle exercises will help to control the symptoms. Shaking your hands when they are numb or tingling may help.Elevation - Where possible, try to elevate your wrists/arms on pillows, to help reduce swelling. This may help in the evenings before going to bed. Exercises for CTS Range-of-motion exercise: Clench st tightly for 5 seconds, then release, straightening your ngers all the way and keep them straight for 5 seconds. Repeat 5 times for each hand.Stretching exercise: Using one hand, bend the ngers and wrist of the other hand back towards you gently. Only stretch it back as far as comfort allows. Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 5 times for each hand.page | 16Will my CTS improve after my baby is born? CTS usually resolves after your baby is born. For some women it can happen immediately, for others it can take a few weeks. Bring your splints to thehospital as your symptoms may be a little worse in the rst few days after yourbaby is born. This is due to extra retained fluid or swelling. Your symptomsshould be gone completely by your six week check with your GP . If not, discussthis with your GP . If you have any queries CTS or would like to get a pair of wrist splints call our Physiotherapy Department on telephone (021) 4920567. Further information is available on: www.hse.ie/healthaz and see 'carpal tunnel syndrome' . Common viral illnesses in pregnancy Chicken Pox Chickenpox is a mild and common childhood illness that most children andsometimes adults catch at some point. It causes a rash of red, itchy spots thatturn into fluid-lled blisters. They then crust over to form scabs, whicheventually drop o. Chickenpox during pregnancy can cause complications, both for the pregnant woman and the unborn baby. However, the actual risk of any complications occurring is low, occurring in approximately three in every 1,000 pregnancies. Most pregnant women who get chickenpox recover, with no adverse eectson the baby. Seek advice from your GP or midwife immediately if you'repregnant and: lyou think you may have chickenpox; leither you've never had chickenpox or you're not sure, and you've been near someone that has it (even if you have no rash or other symptoms); or lyou get chicken pox within seven days of giving birth.page | 17Whooping cough Whooping cough (medically known as pertussis) is a serious infection thatcauses long bouts of coughing and choking, making it hard to breathe. Getting vaccinated while you're pregnant may help to protect your baby from developing whooping cough in the rst few weeks of their life. The immunity you get from the vaccine will protect you and will pass to your baby through the placenta and provide passive protection for them until theyare old enough to be routinely vaccinated against whooping cough. The antibodies you pass to your baby in the womb decline rapidly in the rst six months of life so it is important your baby gets the routine childhoodvaccines (which include whooping cough vaccine) on time at two, four andsix months. Is it safe for pregnant women to be vaccinated for whooping cough?Yes. The vaccine is safe for pregnant women. The National Immunisation Oce has recommended this vaccine for pregnant women in Ireland. This whoopingcough vaccine has been studied in pregnant women in the US and no riskshave been found. Reactions are generally mild and serious side eects arevery rare. Further information is available on: www.immunisation.ie and search for 'whooping cough and pregnancy' .page | 18Section 2. Preparing to give Birth Preparing a Birth Plan A birth plan is a written plan that helps you to think about options you may like to explore around your labour and birth. There is a section in yournotes/chart about your birth plan. Discuss your wishes for your labour andbirth with your partner. Talk to your midwife or doctor at your antenatal visitsabout your wishes. Keep an open mind when you are discussing your birth process as plans may need to change. Packing your Bag What you need to bring with you for your stay at Cork University MaternityHospital: Mother lyour maternity chart, l4 large packs maternity sanitary towels, l3 or more cotton nightdresses or pyjamas (an old nightdress or t-shirt for the Birthing Suite), ldisposable/or large panties, ldressing gown, lslippers, and ltoiletries: shower cap, soap, towels, face cloth, wash bag, etc. Baby l4 baby vests, l6 babygros and bibs, lbaby towels for washing baby, l24 disposable nappies (extra will be required if baby is admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit), l1 roll cotton wool, lbaby wipes or baby cleansing lotion, lVaseline or Sudocrem, lblanket and hat for going home, and lbaby seat for car journey home.page | 19Nesting Normal pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, but it can range from 38 to 42 weeks. In the last few weeks of pregnancy you may have noticed your body is gettingready for the birth of your baby. You may begin to clean the house andmany women describe a burst of activity that can come before labour. It isoften called 'nesting' . How can I help my baby to get into the bestposition for birth? Your baby is also preparing for birth bytrying to get into the best position to beborn. The best position for your baby tobe in at the start of labour is with hishead down and his back faced outwardstowards your tummy. This is called optimal fetal positioning or theoccipito-anterior (Oa) position. Sometimes babies may adopt a head down, back inwards (towards your back)approach, called the occipito-posterior (OP) position. This OP position may lead to a longer labour time. To encourage your baby to adopt an OA position there are a few things that you could try from 34 weeks onwards. The best way to do this is to spend lots of time kneeling upright, or sitting upright, or on your hands and knees. lWhen you sit on a chair, make sure your knees are lower than your pelvis, and your trunk should be tilted slightly forwards. lWatch TV while kneeling on the floor, over a beanbag or cushions, or sit on a dining chair. lTry sitting on a dining chair facing (leaning on) the back as well. lUse yoga positions while resting, reading or watching TV - for example, tailor pose (sitting with your back upright and soles of the feet together, knees out to the sides). page | 20lSit on a wedge cushion in the car, so that your pelvis is tilted forwards. Keep the seat back upright. Don't cross your legs! This reduces the spaceat the front of the pelvis, and opens it up at the back. For good positioning,the baby needs to have lots of space at the front. lDo not put your feet up! Lying back with your feet up encourages posterior presentation. lSleep on your side, not on your back. lAvoid deep squatting, which opens up the pelvis and encourages the baby to move down, until you know he/she is the right way round. We recommend squatting on a low stool instead, and keeping your spine upright, and not leaning forwards. lSwimming with your belly downwards is said to be very good for positioning babies - not backstroke, but lots of breaststroke and front crawl. Breaststroke in particular is thought to help with good positioning,because all those leg movements help open your pelvis and settle the baby downwards. lA birthing ball can encourage good positioning, both before and duringlabour. lVarious exercises done on all fours can help such as wiggling your hips from side to side. If the baby's back is positioned toyour back, getting down on the floor on your hands and knees (all foursposition) in late pregnancy or labouris helpful. Please be aware that this may not be suitable for allpregnancies or for all women soalways ask your midwife or doctorrst. Only do this if there is just one baby and it's coming head rst. Your baby's head also needs to drop down into your pelvis, this is called engagement, dropping or lightening. If it is your rst baby, his head may drop down into your pelvis from about 37 weeks on. Don't worry if this does not happen until you go into labour. Further information is available on: http://optimal-foetal-positioning.co.nz All fours positionpage | 21Preparing your body to give birth - perineal massage Research has shown that massaging your perineum from approximately 34weeks into your pregnancy reduces the risk of damaging this area during birth(with a tear or bruising). This is particularly benecial if you are having yourrst baby. Antenatal perineal massage can also help with your recovery after the birth, particularly if you are having your second or further babies. What is the perineum and pelvic floor? The perineum is the area of tissue between your vagina and anus (openingof your back passage). It connects with the muscles of the pelvic floor. Thepelvic floor is a hammock of muscles which support your pelvic organs, suchas your bladder and bowel. Tearing your perineum during childbirth can aect the support that your pelvic floor gives you at the back wall of your vagina. This can mean that youare more likely to have a prolapse (or dropping down) of your uterus. A weakpelvic floor can also aect the control you have over your bladder and bowel.Damage to your perineum might also lead to discomfort and pain duringsexual intercourse. Approximately, 85% of women will have some degree ofperineal tear during a vaginal birth. What is perineal massage? Perineal massage is a way of preparing your perineum to stretch more easilyduring childbirth. During birth the perineal tissues need to relax and open toallow your baby to pass through your vagina. The advantages of perineal massage are: lIt increases the elasticity (stretchiness) of the perineum. This improves the perineum's blood flow and ability to stretch more easily and less painfully during the birth of your baby. lTears in the perineum are less likely, and you are less likely to need an episiotomy (a cut to the perineum that is sometimes performed to speed up the birth of your baby or to prevent a more severe tear). lIt helps you focus on the feeling of letting your perineum open up. lYour perineum is less likely to be painful after the birth of your baby.page | 22lIt can be particularly helpful if you have previous scar tissue or a rigid perineum, which can occur in some horse riders or dancers. When should I start?You can start anytime from when you are 34 weeks pregnant. Perineal massage can be done by you or your partner, if you are comfortable with this. You may want to start o yourself and then inviteyour partner to massage as you get nearer to the time of the birth. When should I do it? A good time is during or after a bath or a shower because the blood vesselsin the area are dilated. This makes the perineum softer and morecomfortable to touch. You are also more relaxed. We suggest you use a smallamount of unscented, organic oil, for example olive, sunflower or grapeseed oil to lubricate the area and make the massage more comfortable. Youcan also use an unscented personal lubricant, such as K-Y Jelly . Do notuse synthetic oils such as baby oil or petroleum jelly (Vaseline). Make sureyour hands are clean before you start. Comfortable positions include: lPropped up with pillows on a bed/sofa with your knees bent out and supported. lResting back in the bath with one leg up the side. Then change legs. lStanding under a warm shower with one leg up on a stool, then change legs. lSitting on the toilet. How do I do it? lGet comfortable and relaxed in a place where you feel safe, secure and will not be interrupted. lYou might nd it easier to use a mirror for the rst few tries, to help you see what you are doing. lPlace one or both thumbs on and just within the back wall of your vagina, resting one or both forengers on the buttocks. You may prefer to use only one hand.page | 23lPressing down a little towards your rectum (back passage), gently massage by moving your thumb(s) and forenger(s) together in an upwards and outwards rhythmic \"U\" shaped movement. You are aiming to massage the area inside your vagina, rather than the skin on the outside. However, you may still feel the stretching sensation on the skin on the outside. lPerineal massage should be comfortable but you will also feel a stretchingfeeling. This is similar to how your perineum will open up as you give birthto your baby. lFocus on relaxing your perineum as much as possible during the massage. lThe massage can last as long as you wish, but aim for around ve minutesat a time. lWith time and practice, as your perineum becomes more elastic, you willincrease your ability to relax and you can increase the pressure towards your rectum. Being able to relax through this feeling of increased pressurewill help you relax as you feel the pressure in labour and your baby's headis about to be born. lRepeat as often as you wish. For most benet, aim for a massage every day or every other day. Do not do perineal massage if you have: lvaginal herpes; lthrush; or lany other vaginal infection. If you feel pain at any point, stop and try again another time. If you continue to nd this painful speak with your midwife or doctor and they will help you to check your technique. See: www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/leaflets/les/10938Pmassage.pdfpage | 24Should I have a birth partner? A midwife will be with you at all times during your labour and birth. If you like, you can also have one person stay with you throughout your labour and birth.You will benet from emotional support in the form of praise, encouragement,being listened to and the physical presence of a support person. Research shows that having continuous support in labour can mean you will: luse less pain-relieving drugs; lhave a better chance of having a natural, vaginal birth; lhave a greater chance of avoiding a Caesarean birth or using forceps or ventouse (vacuum); and lhave a more satisfying childbirth experience. Helpful hints for your birth partner lJust being there is very supportive. You can be a very important supportin the early labour before you go to the hospital. lYou may not like hospitals or worry about being 'in the way' . However, yourpresence is a valuable source of support for your partner. Having a friendlyface is very important to women in labour. If you have any worries discussthem with the midwife. lQuiet time is very important for the woman in labour. This is especially true when labour progresses and the contractions are coming often. Try not to talk or ask questions while your partner is having a contraction as this can be very distracting. lMake sure she is well supported and relaxed. Work through any relaxation techniques you have learned and practiced during the pregnancy. lHelp her to concentrate on her breathing techniques, if she needs it. Beware of over breathing as this can lead to dizziness or pins and needles- in this case she will need to slow her breathing down. lDiscuss how to deal with contractions together beforehand. It takes PRaCTICE to master pain coping techniques. These techniques need to become a HaBIT in order for them to work in stressful situations like labour. It's dicult for women to make decisions when in labour but shewill know at the time what she most needs and her wishes need to be respected. page | 25lEye to eye contact can be helpful as it helps focus attention away from the pain. lMassage. This will need to be discussed beforehand as some women arehypersensitive during labour and may nd touch annoying. Ask her whereshe needs it, how strong it needs to be and be aware that over massagingcan lead to skin soreness. Avoid this by using massage oil like olive oil orgrape seed oil. lPositions. Using dierent positions in labour may be useful for dierent times. Practice these beforehand and how best you may support her. lRemember there is no 'right' way for labour and birth to happen. Each woman's experience is dierent and each time she does it, it's dierent. Take each contraction as it comes. Do not try to anticipate events. Ask questions and do the best thing at that time in each given situation. page | 26What is labour? Labour is the process by which your baby is born. It usually starts by itself between 38 and 42 weeks and ends up with you actively helping your babyto be born. Normal labour usually begins with occasional contractions(tightening of the womb) which will happen more often and last for longeras your labour continues. Your waters may release naturally and the neck of your womb (cervix) will open (dilate) to allow your baby to be born. In rst time mothers this processmay take up to 18 hours and up to 12 hours for mothers expecting theirsecond or later baby. Sometimes the waters do not release until your baby isalmost ready to be born. There are three phases of labour: 1. Contraction phase of Labour. This is when your contractions make the neck of your womb (cervix) gradually open up and it continues until it is fully open at 10cms. 2. Birth phase of labour: from when the neck of your womb is fully open until your baby is born. This is the part of labour where you help your baby to move through your vagina by pushing with your contractions. 3. Birth of placenta: this happens after the birth of your baby. Contractions cause the afterbirth (placenta) to come out through the vagina. What are the signs that my labour may be starting? There is no one denite sign that tells you labour may be starting, thefollowing are examples of what you can expect. A show, waters releasing, contractions, backache and an urge to go to the toilet are all signs of labour starting. We will now explain what these signsmean and what to do when you experience any or all of these. l Show: this is when you pass a bloody, plug of mucus from your cervix. This looks like egg white streaked with blood.Section 3. Labour and Birthpage | 27l Regular and painful uterine contractions: these are painful so they are dierent to the Braxton Hicks (practice) contractions that you might get from 36 weeks onwards. l Waters releasing/breaking: Your unborn baby develops and grows inside a bag of fluid called the amniotic sac. When it's time for your babyto be born, the sac breaks and the amniotic fluid drains out through yourvagina. This is your waters releasing/breaking. You may feel a slow trickle,or a sudden gush of water that you cannot control. If your waters break/ release before labour starts phone the hospital for advice. l Backache and an urge to go to the toilet, which is caused by your baby's head pressing on your bowel. If you have any of the above signs, it doesn't not mean that you have to hurryto the hospital but may mean that labour will start soon. If you are unsureplease phone the hospital and we will discuss the best option for you. If you experience heavy vaginal bleeding (this is not usual) or if your waters are releasing (the sac of water around the baby breaking), please come directly to the Reception at Cork University Maternity Hospital and we will see you.Remember to bring your chart with you. active Labour (True Labour) Practice Labour (False Labour) Contractions/Surges Contractions/Surges May be irregular at first. Usually become regular, longer, closer together and stronger.Usually irregular and short. Do not get closer together. Do not get stronger Walking makes them stronger Walking does not make them stronger Lying down does not make them go away Lying down may make them go away Usually felt in the lower back and may radiate to the frontUsually felt in the top of the uterus and groin Changes in the cervix/neck of womb Changes in the cervix/neck of womb It softens, thins and opensIt may soften but no significant change in thinning or opening Baby Baby Begins to go into the pelvis No real change in position If you have any worries about your labour including your baby' s movements or if your waters are releasing please contact Cork University Maternity Hospital at any time, day or night,on telephone (021) 4920545.page | 28What will I do if labour starts at home? If it's your rst pregnancy, you may feel unsure about when you should go into hospital, telephone us for advice on (021) 4920545. If your waters have released (broken), we will tell you to come in to be checked. If it is your rst baby and you are having contractions but your watershave not released (broken), we may ask you to wait at home until yourcontractions are: lregular, lstrong, labout ve minutes apart, and llasting about 45-60 seconds. If you don't live near the hospital, you may need to come in before you get tothis stage. Make sure you know the signs of labour and what happens. Second babies often arrive more quickly than the rst, so you may need to contact the hospital, sooner. Telephone the hospital before leaving home, andremember to bring your chart. If you are happy to stay at home, stay as active as possible when your labour starts. You can do a lot at home before you decide to go in to hospital: lHave a bath or a shower. lGo for a walk. lHave a snack, as this will keep your energy levels up during labour. lPractice the breath awareness that you learned at our Preparation for Birth and Parenthood Education programme. Time your contractions so that you know when they are strong and that you need to go into the hospital.page | 29What happens at the hospital? A midwife will assess you and if you are in early labour and you live nearby you may prefer to go home until labour becomes more established (getsstronger). If you need to stay in hospital, we will admit you to the antenatal ward or the birthing suite. If you are admitted to the antenatal ward it may not be possiblefor your partner to stay with you during the night. This is for the comfort ofother mothers and babies who may be sleeping. However, if you are in labourand are admitted directly to one of the single birthing suite rooms yourpartner will be able to stay with you. Inducing Labour What is induction of labour? In most pregnancies labour starts naturally between 37 and 42 weeks. Inpreparation for labour the cervix (neck of womb) softens and shortens. Thisis called ripening. Before or during labour the membranes break and the fluidsurrounding the baby drains away. This is also known as 'the waters releasing' .The cervix then opens up and the womb contracts and pushes the baby out.Induction of labour is the term used when this process is started articially.About one in ve labours are induced. Why is it necessary to induce your labour? We oer to induce your labour if we feel it would benet you and your baby's health. Your doctor will explain why it is being recommended for you. The most common reasons for induction are: lProlonged pregnancy. If you are 10 days over your expected date of birth we will oer you an induction. This is because the placenta, which nourishes the baby may begin to work less eciently after this time. lIf your waters have broken (released) more than 24 hours and labour hasnot started. There is an increased risk of infection to both you and your baby. lIf your baby is not growing as well as expected. lIf you have any medical conditions such as pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure or diabetes.page | 30Where does induction take place? As it can take up to 24 hours for labour to start after we induce you, you eitherstay in our Induction Room, which has ve beds or in an antenatal ward. Whenlabour starts we will take you to the birthing suite. How do you induce labour? We use three ways to induce labour. You may need just one or you may needall three. 1. Prostaglandin gel/tablets. We use this hormone if your cervix is not ripe. It softens the cervix and encourages labour to begin. We place the gel ortablets behind the cervix during an internal examination, and you will remain in bed for at least 30 minutes afterwards to allow it to be absorbed.It is normal to have some tightenings but this does not necessarily meanthat you have gone into labour. It may be necessary to repeat the gel or tablets after six to eight hours if it has not had an eect on the cervix. Wewill monitor your baby's heartbeat using a machine called a fetal monitorbefore we give you the gel/tablets. 2. articial Rupture of Membranes (aRM). This is another name for breaking the waters. We will only do this if your cervix is soft and open. The doctor or midwife will gently break the waters during an internal examination. This allows the baby's head to push down on the cervix andencourages labour to start. It only takes a few minutes and can be a bit uncomfortable. You will be encouraged to move around afterwards. We will monitor your baby's heartbeat for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, using a fetal monitor. 3. Oxytocin. This is a hormone, given in a drip, which causes the womb to contract. We will place a small plastic tube (cannula) in a vein in your hand and connect the drip to it. We will increase the rate of the drip gradually until your contractions are regular and strong. When you are on the drip we will monitor your baby's heartbeat all the time, using a fetal monitor.page | 31are there any risks with induction? 1. y our labour fails to start , which is rare but it can happen. The doctor and midwife will fully explain the options available to you and you will make a decision together based on the best choice for you and your baby's health. Induction increases the risk of having an assisted birth or a Caesareanbirth. For information on assisted births and Caesarean births see page 50. 2. Increased need for pain relief: Some women nd that the pain is more intense when labour is induced. We will oer you support and appropriate pain relief. This includes inhaled gas, tablets and injections. You can ask for an epidural when your labour starts. Further information on pain reliefis on page 50. 3. Over stimulation of the womb: Sometimes the drugs we use for induction can cause the womb to contract too much. This can aect the baby's heartbeat and may be very uncomfortable for you. In that case, wewill stop using or reduce the drugs and we will monitor your baby continuously. We can also give you other drugs to counteract the eect of the induction drugs, if necessary. Can my birth partner stay with me?Yes, your birth partner can stay with you from 8am to 10pm while you are inthe ward. They will have to go home at night as you and other women andbabies will need to sleep. When you are in the birthing suite your partner can stay with you until you give birth. No other visitors are allowed duringinduction.page | 32Being active In Labour Spend some time thinking about what positions you'd like to use before you go into labour. Use the skills you have learned at our Preparation for Birth andParenthood Education programme to try out dierent positions andPRaCTICE these skills at home with your partner so that you become comfortable with them and nd what works for you. Practice these skills so that they will come naturally to you when it comes to labour and birth. lWalking in labour helps shorten the early stages of labour and can be a distraction, especially if things seem to be moving slowly. lWhen you are in active labour, you might need support to walk betweencontractions. At this time, you might prefer to lie on your side or in a reclining position as these positions will help your body to fully relax. lThe Slow Dance is an upright childbirth position that uses gravity and movement to increase comfort during labour. It is usually done by rhythmically rocking back and forth, with or without music, as you put your arms around your birth companion's neck and shoulders. Your birthpartner can apply counter pressure to any particular spot or simply wraptheir arms around your belly. You can rest your head on the partner's shoulder or neck if you prefer.It is also easy to use other comfort measures while in this position, such as any of the relaxation techniques, breathing,counter-pressure, or hot/cold pads. This position can also be very emotionally supportive for you.page | 33What positions can I use for Labour and Birth? There are many benets to staying upright in labour for as long as possible. This means using any position that avoids lying flat. The benets include: lGravity helps your baby move down the birth passage; lBetter oxygen supply to your baby; lBaby gets into a better position for its journey down the birth canal; and lContractions are stronger and more eective when you are upright. This helps your cervix (neck of womb) to open up more quickly and leadsto a shorter labour. Why will it help me if I stay upright instead of lying down? You will know best which position is best for you and your baby when you arein labour. Many women say they have an urge to stay upright, mobile andadopt a certain range of positions, which helps relieve the pain ofcontractions. Being upright can be: lstanding, lsitting in a chair, lon a birthing ball, lkneeling, lsquatting, or lon all fours. However, some equipment such as electronic monitors, drips (intravenous infusions) and epidurals can limit your movement but we will help you to stay as upright as comfortably possible.page | 34The benets of being in an upright position rather than lying down for labour and birth Upright Positions: Standing, Kneeling and SquattingLying Positions: Lying down In Labour In Labour Gravity works: Weight of the baby's head puts even pressure on the cervix (neck of womb), means it opens faster.Gravity doesn't work: Less pressure on the cervix (neck of womb) from the baby's head, means uneven pressure on the cervix with slower opening. Womb tilts forward during contractions freely: means better contractions and less pain.Womb tilts backwards during contractions, less free: means slower contractions and more pain. Less Pressure on Major Blood Vessels: Means better blood flow to the baby and better oxygen supply with less risk of baby getting distressed.Weight of womb presses on major blood vessels: This can aect the blood flow to the baby and placenta with a risk of baby getting into distress. Sacrum (lower part of spine) can move: Pelvic canal can widen and make room for the baby's head.Sacrum (lower part of spine)can't move: Pelvic canal and outlet are narrowed. Pelvic joints can expand and move which means less pressure on nerves: Less pressure on joints means less pain and more space for the baby as the room in the pelvis increases.Pelvis less mobile meaning more pressure on nerves: More pressure leads to pain and less space for the baby as the room in the pelvis is reduced. Birth Birth Pelvis upright: Baby's angle of descent (downward movement) is easier womb exerts maximum force bearing down is ecient Birthing phase (second stage) is shorter.Pelvis flat/horizontal: Baby's angle of descent is uphill. Bearing down is less ecient Birthing phase (Second stage) is prolonged. Perineum expands evenly: This reduces the risk of tearing.Direct pressure on perineum: This leads to greater risk of tearing. Baby at birth in best position. Baby at birth, position may be compromised. Mum upright and active: Less need for pain relief or interventions (to help get your baby out).Gravity assist separation and expulsion of the placenta.Mum passive: More need for pain relief and interventions (to help get your baby out). Less ecient separation of placenta.page | 35Using birthing balls (gym balls) and other equipment during labour We have many items to support you and make you feel more comfortable in our birthing suites. These include pillows, adjustable beds, floor mats, a poolroom and wall rails (in the bathrooms). The birthing suite beds are adjustableinto many positions to help you give birth comfortably, (see pictures on page39). Birthing balls, also called gym balls, are available in the birthing suite.However, the use of some hospital equipment can limit your movement inlabour for example electronic fetal (baby) monitors, drips and epidurals.Discuss your wishes about your positions in labour with the midwife caringfor you. If you PRaCTICE with the equipment, for example a birthing ball, during your pregnancy you will feel more comfortable using them when you are in labour. It is not a good idea to use a birthing ball for labour, if you have not practisedusing it beforehand. What are helpful positions in the labour phase and the contractionphase? Standing and leaning forward lThis position can help your baby's head stretch your cervix by using gravity. lLeaning forwards and keeping your legs apart helps your pelvis widen. lA step can be used instead of a chair (Please avoid using this position if you have pelvic girdle pain). KneelingKneeling is helpful because it can help relieve back pain. Gravity helps your cervix stretch and your pelvis widens as you lean forward and keeps your legs apart. page | 36Sitting on a birthing ball Sitting is a helpful position as it allows gravityto help stretch your cervix. It can be acomfortable position to rest in. It allows yourpartner to do some massage. Leaningforward and keeping your legs apart helpswiden your pelvis. Sitting on a birthing ball is helpful because it is versatile and a comfortable position to rest in. It also allows your partner to do some massage if youwould like that. When sitting on a birthing ball ensure it is inflated such thatyour hips are higher than your knees. This makes it easier to lean forward towiden your pelvis. Rocking back and forth can be soothing and helps yourcervix stretch. Tips for buying a birthing ball: lIt is safer to get a ball with an anti-burst valve. lPumps are often sold with gym balls or it can be inflated at the air pump at a petrol station. lAccording to the manufacturer's guidelines, the table below helps you tochoose your birthing (gym) ball: l y ou will need a larger ball, if: l you have longer legs and your knees are above 90 degrees and are higher than your hips when sitting on the ball. l you have a back problem. y our Height Ball Size Less the ball before you buy it to ensure the ball is big enough. lTo see if a 55cm ball is right for you, place a mark on a wall about 20 inches high (16 in. for a 45cm ball), and squat next to it. Consider that you will sink down a few inches (depending on your weight and amount of inflation). This is approximately how tall the ball will be when sitting on it. Get a larger size if you don't like this height! Most people underinflate a ball because it is so rm (like a rock) when inflated to its maximum diameter. lMake sure that the ball is inflated correctly and that when you sit on it your hips are higher than your knees. Further information is available on: www.cuh.hse.ie and search 'positions for an active labour' . page | 38Peanut ball There are several dierent positions to use the peanut ball. During activelabour and transition, the midwife will help you to nd the most comfortableposition for you. See pictures below. Further information is available on: www.cappa.net see 'archived articles' and On Labouring Women' . page | 39What are helpful positions when I'm giving birth (pushing phase)? Sitting upright: lUses gravity to assist with the birth of your baby. lHelps to widen your pelvis. Leaning forward and bringing your legs apart in this position also helpsto widen your pelvis. Kneeling: lUses gravity to assist with the birth of your baby. lCan help relieve back pain. lCan be more comfortable if you have pain in the pubic area during pregnancy and nd keeping your legs apart uncomfortable. The back of the bed may be positioned to upright to be used as a support instead of the bar. If you have an epidural: lYou will be unable to lean on or take weight through your legs as they may be numb. lYou can be supported into upright sitting. This allows gravity to assist withthe birth of your baby. We can put pillows at either side of your legs to support them. lLying on your side with your upper leg supported will allow your pelvis to widen, bringing your tailbone out of the way. This helps with the birthof your baby. Examination:If we need to examine you or help you with the birth of your baby, we mayplace your legs on supports to do theexamination easily. Your midwife and doctor are there to provide you with advice and support regarding labour positions. You may change positions during thesecond stage of labour depending on how longit is and how it is progressing. Further information is available on: www.givingbirthnaturally.com and search 'positions for childbirth' . page | 40Breathing Techniques for Labour Breathing lDuring labour the contractions you feel may cause you to become tense. lWhen tense, breathing may be erratic, or you may hold your breath. lBreathing is something you can use to help you deal with the contractions in labour. How can breathing help in labour? lIt increases the oxygen available to you and your baby. lIt helps you to relax. lIt conserves your energy. Breathing techniques for the contraction stage of labour 1. Slow Relaxed Deep Breathing Technique lSit comfortably with your eyes closed and rest your hands on your tummy. lAs the contraction begins, breathe deeply in through your nose and feelyour tummy rise. lPurse your lips and exhale slowly through your mouth. lAs you breathe out let the tension flow from your body as if you are blowing a feather away. lKeep your shoulders relaxed. lBreathing should be slow and relaxed. lWhen in doubt breathe out. l Focus on your breathing.....Focus on the contraction. Try not to let your mind race ahead. 2. Sigh Out Slowly (SOS) Breathing Technique As the rst phase of your labour progresses and the contractions arebecoming more frequent and intense, you may nd the SOS breathingtechnique more useful to cope. This breathing technique will help keep youcalm and focused on the task and maintain a regular breathing pattern. lOpen your mouth. lSigh out long and slowly; imagine you are fogging up a mirror. lBreathe in and repeat this technique.page | 41Pushing Technique - Birth Stage of Labour Your midwife will tell you when you have reached this stage and you may feel a strong urge to push. How do I push? lIt is important to work with the 'urge' to push. The urge to push is similar to the urge to opening your bowels, therefore pushing is similar to opening your bowel. lGet into the position that feels most comfortable for you. lBreathe in through your nose allowing your belly to expand and widen your waist as you breathe in. lBreathe out through your mouth and as you breathe out keep your bellyand waist widened and bear down steadily through your back passage asyou would if you were emptying your bowel. lKeeping your belly and waist widened helps you to bear down more easily. lGrunting and moaning on breathing out also helps with the force required to bear down. lDon't hold your breath when bearing down. lKeep your chin tucked in gently towards your chest. This can help direct the pressure downwards. lRepeat as needed. lIt is important to relax between contractions and remember to breathe slowly and deeply. PantingAs your baby's head is stretching the vaginal muscles you may feel a tight,burning sensation. Stay calm as your midwife will guide you through panting. Why do I need to pant?Panting helps your vaginal muscles to slowly stretch over your baby's head.This allows you to give birth to your baby slowly and safely. How do I pant? lOpen your mouth in the shape of an 'O' . lMake an 'OH' 'OH' panting sound. (like blowing out a candle). lStay calm and listen to your midwife. lYour midwife will guide you to push and pant when needed. Further information is available on: www.cuh.hse.ie .page | 42Dealing with contractions (Pain Relief Options) Pain from contractions in labour is probably one of the most important issues for all pregnant women. Labour can be painful, so it's important to learn aboutall the ways that you can relieve the pain. It's also helpful for whoever is going to be with you during your labour to know about the dierent options, as well as how they can support you.Discuss the issue with your birthing partner. All pain relief options will havebeen explained to you during our Preparation for Birth and ParenthoodEducation programme. Preparation for childbirth during pregnancy (such as breathing techniques, positions, helpful equipment and medication) has been shown to reduce theneed for pain relief in labour. If you have not had information before the babyis born, the midwife looking after you in labour will guide you. You may needhelp and support from the midwife to choose between the dierent methods,of coping with labour, available to you. Massage Your partner or midwife can help by massaging you in labour. However somewomen may prefer not to be touched. Be sure to discuss this beforehand andlet them know what feels right. It is a good idea to start practicing this in the weeks before your due date and before labour starts so that it will feel natural when you are in labour. You will learn some massage techniques at thePreparation for Birth and Parenthood Education programme. page | 43Water Water is very helpful and therapeutic in labour. There areshowers and baths available onthe wards and each birthingroom has an en suite shower.We also have a pool room,which you may use: if it isavailable; if there are enoughsta on duty; and if using thepool is safe for you and your baby. Will I be able to use the pool? You will be able to use the pool if you: lhave a straightforward pregnancy; lare in the contraction stage of labour; lare able to move around without diculty; lhave no medical conditions; lif your waters are not broken (released) more than 18 hours; and lhave not received Pethidine in the previous four hours. Can I give birth in the pool?No, the pool facility at CUMH is not for use during birth. However, you can give birth upright, or on a mat in the pool room, or move to a nearby room. What clothes do I need to bring to the pool room? A dressing gown and non-slip shoes/flip flops. Some women like to wear a t-shirt or a similar item in the pool. Will the midwife assist me in and out of the pool? Women using the pool must be fully mobile as health and safety guidelinesrecommend that our sta do not lift women whenever possible. What is the water temperature? The water will be at body temperature (37\u00ba C) which is nice and warm. page | 44Can I eat and drink in the pool? We encourage women to eat and drink during labour whether you are in thepool or not. Can I use Gas and air (Entonox) in the pool? Yes. How will the midwife monitor my baby while I am in the pool? The midwife will use an underwater machine called a Sonicaid to listen to yourbaby's heartbeat. Will labour slow down when I get into the pool? Rarely- once you are in established labour the water can relax you and speedup the labour. Complementary therapies Complementary therapies that may help you include: lhypno-birthing, lacupuncture, laromatherapy, lhomeopathy or lreflexology. Consult a qualied therapist to discuss the use of these therapies inpregnancy, labour and after you give birth to your baby. Please discuss your intended use of any of these therapies with your midwife. TENS machine What is a TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation)? TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) is a non-invasive, drug- free method of controlling pain. It has been used for many years for thecontrol of acute and chronic pain, particularly where people are wishing tominimise their use of medication. Over the last 15 to 20 years women havebeen using TENS as a means of managing labour pain.page | 45The TENS unit consists of a battery powered stimulator and one or two pairs of electrodes with connecting leads. A mild electrical current is produced bythe TENS unit which you will feel as a tingling sensation on your skin. Theintensity, rate and duration of the electrical impulses produced by the TENSunit can be adjusted by the person using it. Benets of using TENS in labour lTENS is a form of non-invasive pain relief lTENS has no harmful eects on either the mother or baby lTENS does not restrict your ability to move about in labour lTENS can be applied at home during early labour Other pain relief options can still be used if TENS does not provide you with adequate pain relief. How does TENS work? When we experience pain, messages are sent along the nerves to the brainand then pain is felt. The TENS unit produces tiny electrical impulses which are sent through the skin to the nerves. This electrical stimulation of the nerves blocks those painmessages from reaching the brain. The brain then registers the tinglingsensation produced by the TENS unit rather than the pain. TENS also increases your body's production of endorphins - these are your body's natural painkillers. page | 46How eective is TENS? For many women, TENS is an attractive rst option for pain relief in labour.Women who use TENS report that they have a feeling of control over theirpain and that they can actively participate in their labour, which is not alwayspossible with other forms of pain relief. Many women who have used TENSare keen to use it again for subsequent labours. However, the results ofresearch on the eectiveness of TENS for relieving labour pain are conflicting.Overall, there is weak evidence of the positive eects of TENS on labour pain;however, better quality research is needed in this area. Precautions when using TENS TENS is an electricity-based apparatus and therefore care must be taken whenusing it. Specic precautions include: lTENS should not be used in the bath or in the shower. lWomen who have metallic implants or an implanted electronic device, (e.g. a cardiac pacemaker) should not use TENS. lTENS should not be used while driving a car. lTENS should not be used prior to the 37th week of your pregnancy unlessadvised by your doctor or physiotherapist. lTENS must be turned o before applying or removing the electrodes. lTENS should be kept out of reach of children. If you wish to use a TENS machine, we recommend that you start using it in early labour. TENS is not an eective pain reliever in established labour. However most women assess TENS favourably and say they would use it again in a subsequent labour. It may be more eective for back pain than abdominal pain. At present you should hire your own TENS machine to bring into hospital and you or your partner need to be able to use it when you come in.page | 47Gas and air (Entonox) We can give you gas and air (Entonox), which is a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide gas to reducepain at anytime during labour, even when you arelabouring in water. It can increase your sense ofpersonal control, as you use it yourself. However, itmay make you feel light-headed and nauseous. Gas and air needs to be used as soon as a contraction starts as it takes 20 seconds to work. By taking gas and air as soon as a contraction starts it meansthat it will be working at its most eective when your contraction reaches itsstrongest point. You can stop using gas and air as soon as the contractionstops. You can then rest in between contractions and takes sips of fluid to keepyou energised. Pethidine injections Pethidine is a pain relieving medication that we can inject into your thighduring the contraction phase / rst stage of labour. However, it only provideslimited pain relief during labour and may make your baby sleepy. This couldslow down your baby's breastfeeding eorts in the rst few hours. We willneed to do a vaginal examination before giving you Pethidine, to check incase the birth of your baby is too close. Further information is available on: used for painrelief in and, in general, aresafe and eective. During anepidural, painkilling drugs arepassed into the small of your backvia a ne tube. It is a regionalanaesthetic, so the drug is injected around the nerves that carrysignals from the part of your body that feels pain in labour. It will numb your tummy and provide you with very eective pain relief. page | 48Setting up your epidural We will insert an intravenous cannula into your arm and attach it to a drip. lYou will need to have a catheter inserted into your bladder to drain yoururine. lWhile the epidural is being put in, it is important that you keep still and let the anaesthetist know if you are having a contraction. lThe epidural usually takes about 20 minutes to set up and a further 20 minutes before it starts to relieve the pain. advantages of an epidural lAn epidural that is working well usually provides excellent pain relief. lEpidurals may also be topped up for a Caesarean birth. Disadvantages of an epidural lSome epidurals do not work fully and need to be adjusted or replaced. lThe most common complication of having an epidural is a headache which may need further treatment (1-2%). lYou may experience low blood pressure, itching or shivering. lYou may experience leg weakness and you will be conned to bed for theduration of the epidural, the birth of your baby and for 6 hours after the birth. We will monitor your baby's heartbeat using a machine called acardiotocograph once you had your epidural. For further information see: www.hse.ie/healthaz when you access this website see 'E' and 'epidural' . Giving Birth Giving birth normally Giving birth normally is when your baby is born vaginally with your own eort. When the neck of the womb is fully open you will get a strong urge to beardown/push. As you bear down, your baby's head moves down the vagina until it can be seen. When the head is almost ready to come out, the midwife will ask you to stop pushing and to pant, (see page 40 breathing techniques \"How do I push?). This helps your baby's head to be born slowly and gently, givingthe skin and muscles of the perineum (the area between your vagina andanus) time to stretch without tearing. page | 49Once your baby's head is born, most of the hard work is over; your baby will be born then with one more gentle push. We can put the baby straight ontoyour abdomen before we clamp and cut the cord. Your baby may be born covered with a white, greasy substance known as vernix, which protected the baby in your uterus. Birth of the placenta (after birth) Once your baby is born, the placenta (afterbirth) will then need to be born.This is the third phase of labour. At CUMH our policy is to medically managethe birth of the placenta. This means that we will give you an injectioncontaining a drug called Syntocinon, during the birth of your baby. This makesthe womb contract and helps to prevent heavy bleeding (haemorrhage). Thisis recommended by the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologistsand the HSE. Should you prefer not to have the Syntocinon injection, this is possible if you have a normal blood count, have started labour naturally and you haven'ttaken any medication, such as an oxytocin drip, pethidine or epidural, duringlabour and birth. The midwife or doctor will discuss the benets and risks ofmedicated and natural management of the third stage of labour with you tohelp you to make an informed choice. We will encourage you to breastfeed your baby as soon after birth as possible. This helps your womb to contract and it also helps with breastfeeding lateron. Having an assisted birth Some women need to have an assisted birth, for which we can use twoinstruments a forceps or a vacuum (also called a ventouse or Kiwi), to helpwith the birth of the baby's head. This is done by a by a specially traineddoctor. The reasons for an assisted birth can be that: lwe are concerned about your baby's heart rate; lyour baby is lying in an awkward position; or lyou are too exhausted to give birth naturally.page | 50Vacuum Birth (also called Ventouse or Kiwi) We will place a suction cup on the baby's head. The doctor with the help ofyour breathing out pushing eort with a contraction, gently helps the birthof your baby, usually with three pushes. We will give you a local anaestheticto help with the pain or we can top up your epidural. Focusing on yourbreathing out eort will help you relax and protect your pelvic floor fromdamage. Forceps Birth Forceps are smooth metal instruments, which are curved to t around thebaby's head. We carefully position the forceps around your baby's head andjoin then together at the handles. With a contraction and your pushing, thedoctor gently pulls to help your baby to be born. We usually give you anepidural or local anaesthetic to help with the pain. Focusing on your breathingout eort will help you relax and protect your pelvic floor from damage. Episiotomy An episiotomy is a cut in your perineum to enlarge the entrance of yourvagina, given under local anaesthetic injection or epidural top up. It is onlygiven after discussion with your midwife or doctor usually if the baby is indistress and has to be born quickly or if an instrumental birth is needed.Afterwards, we will stitch the cut to help the healing process. Will I have to have an episiotomy if I have an assisted birth? We usually need to do an episiotomy during a forceps or vacuum birth. Themidwife or doctor will only do it, if necessary. Focusing on your breathing helps you to relax during this procedure. Caesarean birth A Caesarean birth is where we will give you an anaesthetic; make a cut in your abdomen and then your uterus, to enable your baby to be born. Sometimesit may not be safe for you or your baby to have a vaginal birth and we may advise you to have a Caesarean birth. As this involves major abdominalsurgery we only advise it when absolutely necessary. If we know in advance that you will need a Caesarean birth, we call this a planned Caesarean birth.Your doctor of midwife will explain it fully to you, give you our information leaflet, answer any questions you may have and get your consent. If, however, unforeseen complications arise during your labour, we may have to performan emergency caesarean birth. If this happens we will discuss it with you and explain the reasons and the anaesthetic choices available (for exampleepidural/spinal or general anaesthetic) and get your consent. page | 51Skin-To-Skin Contact We recommend that you make skin-to-skin contact with your baby immediately after birth unless you or your baby needs medical treatment. Thishelps your baby to adjust to life outside the womb and also helps youbreastfeed. We will place your healthy newborn baby naked (with a nappy) on your chest for at least one hour. The midwife will help you with your rst feed during skin-to-skin contact. Wear a very loose tting top without a bra or neck jewellerywhen you begin labour. If you or your baby need medical care immediately after birth, we will help you start skin-to-skin contact as soon as possible. Examples of medical carethat will delay starting skin-to-skin contact include: lstitching; lbeing in a legs up position (known as the Lithotomy position); lhaving received sedation; or lif you have had a Caesarean birth. We will dress your baby in a Babygro (without a vest) and wrap him in blankets. When you move to the recoveryroom we will unwrap the blankets, open the Babygro and you can make skin-to-skin contact then. Section 4. After the Birth page | 52During the early hours of life both you and the healthcare sta need to closely observe your baby while he is in skin-to-skin contact or breastfeeding so that,he: lis in a good position that keeps his airway open; lis breathing easily and regularly; and lhas a good colour. Your midwife will explain this to you. To ensure that your baby enjoys safe skin-to-skin contact make sure that: lyour baby's chest is on your chest; lyour baby's head is turned to one side and visible; lyour baby's nose and mouth are not covered; lyour baby's neck is straight not bent; lyour baby's back is covered with a blanket; and lyou are not wearing tight restrictive clothing or neck jewellery. We will give you a leaflet on safe skin-to-skin contact when you are 32 weeks pregnant and when you come in to give birth. We also give you informationon other baby safety issues and safe sleep when you are in hospital.page | 53Vitamin K We recommend that all babies born at Cork University Maternity Hospital receive Vitamin K, to ensure that your baby's blood will clot properly and toprevent bleeding disorders. Why does the baby need Vitamin K? Babies are born with low levels of Vitamin K and are prone to a bleedingdisorder that can be prevented by giving your baby Vitamin K. How is Vitamin K given? With your consent, the midwife will give your baby an injection of Vitamin K1mg (0.1ml) into the thigh. When is Vitamin K given? Vitamin K will be given to your baby in the Birthing Suite immediately afterbirth. are there any side eects? While there are no reports of side eects from the Vitamin K, some babies willhave a minor swelling for a short time around the injection area. Examining baby While you are establishing skin-to-skin contact, we will examine your baby from head to toe. We will take your baby's temperature and check his oxygenlevels. We will check your baby's identication and security tags and put them onto your baby in front of you. Please feel free to ask us any questions that you may have at this time. page | 54Examining mum We will also examine: lyou to see if you need stitches to repair a natural tear or after an episiotomy. lyour tummy to ensure that your uterus has tightened after the birth of your baby and the placenta. lyour placenta to make sure that it has all been delivered.We will also check that your blood loss is normal and not too heavy. You can have some refreshments while you and your partner spend sometime with your baby while the midwife completes the paperwork. We will thentransfer you and your baby to a postnatal ward or room. Baby Tagging Security System In order to keep all babies safe, we have a computerised Baby Security systemalong with a strict Baby Security policy at CUMH. When your baby is born, wetie an electronic security tag on to your baby's ankle. This tag is picked up by the computerised security system, which is monitored at all times by the security ocers and the midwifery sta. If a babyapproaches a door the tag will activate and the door will automatically lock.If a baby with a tag goes through a door the next door will lock and an alarmwill sound. All of this activity is carefully monitored. When the baby is going home we will remove the security tag.page | 55Moving on to the postnatal ward You and your baby will stay together at all times while in hospital unless the baby needs special care. Your baby will stay at your bedside and this is calledRooming In. It helps you to get used to caring for your baby and to recognisewhen your baby needs feeding, which helps a lot with mothers who arebreastfeeding. All newborn babies have very tiny tummies and they prefer to feed little and often. This can be challenging in the rst few days of life. Once babies are wetting and soiling their nappies you can be assured that they are getting enoughmilk. You will need plenty of rest, help and support in the rst few days. Duringyour stay the midwives will examine you and your baby daily. They will assistyou with feeding and baby care. Washing your hands before and after nappychanging and before feeding your baby is very important in preventinginfection. A paediatric (baby) doctor will carry out a full examination of your baby at your bedside before you go home. Visiting Times Our hospital has strict visiting times. Mothers have told us this is helpful to allow for rest and baby bonding. Be sure to tell your family and friends that they will not be allowed to visit outside of these times. You may prefer to askthem to wait until you are at home when you will be very grateful for the visits and support. lHusbands and partners: 7am visiting: 3pm-4pm and pm. (Children may only visit during these times.)Visiting Timespage | 56Special Cases What happens if my baby needs to go to the Neonatal Unit? Occasionally some babies who may be premature or unwell need to be admitted to our Neonatal Unit for specialised care. The Neonatal Unit hasintensive care and special care areas. In the unit we practice skin-to-skin carefor parents and babies. We encourage mothers to express breast milk forpremature babies who cannot suck. Our sta will inform you of the benetsof providing breast milk for babies while they are in the Neonatal Unit. Parents are welcome to visit and spend time with their babies in the Neonatal Unit. A parent support group is run in the unit weekly and neonatal stamembers attend. There is also a dedicated social work service for the NeonatalUnit. Further information is available on: www.irishprematurebabies.com The Irish Neonatal Health Alliance supports families aected by prematurityby advocating increased awareness, improved pre-conceptual, ante-nataleducation and post natal education equitable and standardised neonatal careand improved long-term care for both the premature baby and the family. Their Facebook page is: www.facebook.com/pages/Irish-Neonatal-Health-Alliance Pregnancy Loss Unfortunately, some women have to deal with a pregnancy loss late inpregnancy. This can be a stillbirth or the death of their baby soon after birth. In Ireland about 350 babies are stillborn every year. This usually means that the pregnancy has lasted for 24 weeks or more and the baby has died in thewomb before birth. A smaller number of babies die soon after birth, in the birthing suite or in the Neonatal Unit. Stillbirth is a signicant and complex bereavement and may have profound and devastating eects on the parents, their other children and their wider family. At Cork University Maternity Hospital we have a dedicated pregnancy loss support team on hand to provide invaluable support and assistance following page | 57a pregnancy loss or the death of a baby soon after birth. We also oer counselling after the parents have returned home in order to help you workthrough the dicult aspects of the grieving process. The team includesbereavement and loss midwives, social work sta and hospital chaplains. Further information is available on: your baby Breastfeeding Your breast milk gives your baby all the nutrients he needs for the rst sixmonths of life. It is important for your baby's health, growth and development.Breastfeeding even for a short time will help to protect your baby's health.Your body will produce all the milk your baby needs for the rst six months.No water or other fluids are needed. From six months onwards you can startyour baby on solid foods, however, your milk continues to be an importantpart of his diet, as other foods are introduced, for up to two years of age andbeyond. The longer you breastfeed the greater the health protection, sobreastfeed as long as you can. Benets of breastfeeding lYour breastmilk is uniquely made for your growing baby's needs. lIt is easy for your baby to digest and breast milk protects your baby's digestive system. lIt helps protect your baby from infection and other illnesses. lResearch suggests that breastfed babies have better mental developmentand it is also important for your baby's brain development. lBreastfeeding is also convenient and free-of-charge. lYou will enjoy the feeling of closeness breastfeeding creates with your baby. lBreastfeeding also provides instant food when your baby is hungry; and it provides instant comfort when your baby is distressed. Benets for mumAs a mother breastfeeding reduces your chances of getting some illnesseslater in life. It can help protect you from breast and ovarian cancer and give you stronger bones in later life. It also helps you lose the weight gained during pregnancy. page | 58Some good reasons to breastfeed Research shows that children who are not breastfed: lare more likely to develop ear, nose and throat infections; lare more likely to develop gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhoea); lare more likely to develop kidney and chest infections; lhave a greater risk of asthma and eczema; lhave a greater risk of obesity and of developing diabetes; and lhave an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Guidelines from the Department of Health, Ireland and World HealthOrganizationThe Department of Health, in line with the World Health Organization,recommends that babies should be exclusively breastfed for six months (notintroducing any other food or drink). You should continue to breastfeed incombination with solid foods until the baby is two years and beyond. Breastfeeding in CUMH Having good information aboutbreastfeeding will help you get o to a goodstart and the right support will help you tocontinue. The breastfeeding service in CorkUniversity Maternity Hospital (CUMH) aims to educate, encourage and empower womenand their families starting and continuing tobreastfeed. We discuss the benets ofbreastfeeding and how we support mothersto breastfeed with all women during theirantenatal visits to the hospital. We oerbreastfeeding classes to all pregnant women. When all mothers give birth to their babies in CUMH, we encourage skin-to-skin contactbetween mother and baby and show youhow to start the rst breastfeed and how tocontinue. We will show you how to position and correctly latch on your babyto your breast. This is the secret to successful breastfeeding. Booklet available to order on: www.breastfeeding.ie and see 'Publications' . page | 59If your baby is in the Neo Natal Unit (NNU) and is too unwell to breastfeed, we will show you how to hand express or pump your breast milk. During your rst days of being a parent we will encourage you to regularly feed your baby on demand and to avoid using formula feed, teats andpaciers. We run a support group for breastfeeding mothers while you are inhospital. Ask a midwife for details. On discharge, we will give you written information about the hospital breastfeeding support group. It is held every Wednesday from 4.30pm to6.30pm in the Parentcraft Room, on the rst floor at CUMH (no appointmentnecessary). There is also a breastfeeding helpline available for any queries youmay have on breastfeeding your baby. The number is (021) 4920752 or (087)6623874. We will also give you information on community breastfeeding support groups facilitated by the public health nurses and voluntary breastfeedingand social support groups (La Leche League, Cuidi and Friends ofBreastfeeding). Recognising if my baby is hungry In the rst few weeks of life your newborn baby will only wake up because heis hungry. Early feeding cues include stirring, mouth opening, head turning,seeking/rooting. If you don't recognise these early cues your baby will becomeincreasingly more alert. Mid feeding cues include stretching, becomingincreasingly more physically active, putting their hand into their mouth.Finally your baby will become upset, begin crying, and becoming moreagitated and distressed. By keeping your baby with you (rooming in) you willlearn to recognise their early feeding cues and this means that you will beable to pick them up and feed them early, before they become too distressed. When you are learning to breastfeed these cues are a useful way of getting toknow your baby.page | 60Further information is available on: http://kemh.health.wa.gov.au , 'breast feeding advice for new parents' . How do I know my baby is getting enough milk? Your breasts will make milk, whether you breast or bottle feed your baby. Therst milk you produce is called colostrum and it is in your breasts from whenyou are 16 weeks pregnant. After your baby is born this colostrum will nourish you baby for the rst three to four days of life. Your milk will change to mature milk around day three to four. Colostrum is small in volume but rich in nutrients, ideal rst food for your baby. You know that your baby is getting enough milk when he is having wet and dirty nappies. For example one wet and one dirty nappy on day one; two wet and two dirty nappies on day two; three wet and three dirty nappies on day three. From four days, on your baby will be having six wet nappies and at least one dirty nappy a day. Source Queensland Health, Australiapage | 61Vitamin D Whether you choose to breastfeed or formula feed your baby you should give your baby 5 micrograms (5\u00b5g) of vitamin D3 every day. Why should I give my baby Vitamin D? Vitamin D helps control the amount of calcium and phosphate in your baby'sbody, which are needed to keep bones and teeth healthy. Children (andadults) in Ireland have low levels of vitamin D which can lead to weak bones.In severe cases low levels of vitamin D can cause rickets in children. There hasbeen an increase in the number of cases of rickets in Ireland in recent years. Vitamin D is known as the 'sunshine vitamin' because our bodies can make vitamin D from the sun. When sunlight hits our skin, the ultra-violet B (UVB)sun rays are used to make vitamin D. However, it is not possible for babies tosafely get the vitamin D they need from the sun. There are a number of suitable Vitamin D3 products available to buy in Ireland. You can nd a list of these products and further information on the websitewww.hse.ie/vitamind or ask your pharmacist, doctor, nurse or otherhealthcare professional. Vaccines and tests for your baby There is a routine vaccination and a number of tests that we will oer for yourbaby while you are in hospital. We will explain them to you and ask for yourconsent to vaccinate and do the tests before doing them. BCG vaccination We oer the BCG vaccination to protect your baby against tuberculosis (TB).Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infection which aects the lungs, but it can aect other parts of the body such as the bones, joints and kidneys. It can also cause meningitis. Although TB can be a very serious disease, it is possible to make a full recovery from most forms of TB with treatment. page | 62When we give your baby the BCG vaccine we will also give you information on further vaccines. Below is a short summary of these vaccinations: Further information is available on: www.immunisation.ie Hearing Test We will oer you a routine hearing screening test for your baby before theyare discharged from hospital. This test uses quick and simple methods tocheck the hearing of all newborn babies. It only takes a few minutes and youcan stay with your baby while the test is being done. The test doesn't hurt andis not uncomfortable. It will usually be done while your baby is asleep orsettled. Why screen my baby's hearing? One to two babies in every 1,000 are born with a hearing loss in one or both ears. It is not easy to tell if a baby has a hearing loss. This hearing screeningtest means that if your baby has a hearing loss, it will be picked up early. Early identication of a problem is important for the development your child. It also means that you get the support and information you need at an early stage. Further information is available on: www.newbornscreening.ie Heel Test (Newborn Bloodspot Screening) Soon after your baby is born we will oer you a Newborn Bloodspot Screening Test (or Heel Prick Test) for your baby. This test is strongly recommended, butyou may say no if you wish. This test helps us to nd rare but serious conditions in babies. Early treatment of these conditions can prevent severedisability or even death. When my baby is My baby should have Number of Injections Born or soon after BCG 1 2 months 6 in 1 + PCV 2 4 months 6 in 1 + Men C 2 6 months 6 in 1 + Men C + PCV 3page | 63In Ireland, all urine disease. The test is carried out four days after your baby isborn. The public health nurse (PHN) or midwife will prick your baby's heelusing a special device to collect some drops of blood onto a special card. Youcan help by making sure your baby is warm and comfortable and by beingready to feed and/or cuddle your baby. For babies at a higher risk ofgalactosaemia, a heel-prick sample will also be taken at birth for a special test(Beutler test). If your baby is at risk of galactosaemia, you may be advised notto breastfeed until the result of a normal test is back. If your baby's tests are normal, we will not contact you directly. Occasionally the public health nurse or midwife will contact you to take a second bloodsample from your baby's heel. This may be because there was not enoughblood collected, or the test result was unclear. Usually the repeat results arenormal. CUMH will have the results of abnormal results within ve workingdays. If your baby's results are of concern we will contact you to arrange moreblood tests. Some babies may need to stay in hospital for a short time. If yourbaby has one of these rare conditions, a team of specialist doctors, dieticians,midwives and nurses will advise you on how to manage your baby's conditionand will follow your baby's progress long term. The majority of babies withthese conditions will grow up healthy and well, once the treatment hasstarted. For further information please ask your midwife or PHN. Further information is available on: www.newbornscreening.ie Newborn Infant Oxygen Saturation Test All infants born at CUMH will have the oxygen levels in their blood checkedby pulse oximetry. The procedure will be performed by your midwife andinvolves attaching a small plastic probe to your infant's foot. It takes about two minutes to perform and your baby will not feel anything. The test helps detect some heart problems that may not otherwise be possible to detect during your baby's newborn examination.page | 64Rubella (German Measles) Vaccination If you are not immune to rubella (rubella negative) we will oer you the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. Rubella is a serious concernif a pregnant woman catches the infection during the rst 20 weeks of herpregnancy. This is because the rubella virus can disrupt the development ofthe baby and cause a wide range of health problems, such as: leye problems, such as cataracts (cloudy patches on the lens of the eye); ldeafness; lheart abnormalities; and lbrain damage. The birth defects caused by the rubella virus are known as congenital rubellasyndrome (CRS). If you get the vaccination at CUMH, it is important not to become pregnant afterwards for one month. Further information is available on: www.immunisation.ie Going home from hospital On average, you will stay in hospital for two nights after a vaginal birth andfour nights after a Caesarean birth but each woman's experience is dierent.You and your baby can go home earlier if all is well and all the screenings andtests have been completed. Please discuss your wishes for returning home with the midwives when you are admitted to the postnatal ward. We ask thatyou leave your room by 11 am on the morning that you are going home asthere will be women waiting in the birthing suite for a bed. Your public health nurse will visit you on your return home. Infant Safety - Car Seats When you are making arrangements to take your baby home please ensure that you have a proper baby car seat. This car seat should be carefully checked on purchase and also checked before baby is discharged. A baby should never be carried in the front passenger seat as most cars now have air bags. Further information is available on: www.rsa.ie and see ' Education Leaflet & Poster Corner' .page | 65Immediate care after vaginal or Caesarean birth This information below is designed to help you recover after a vaginal or Caesarean birth. Further advice is provided by a woman's healthphysiotherapist or a midwife. Classes are held in the wards at CUMH after yougive birth. Rest Rest properly after childbirth to help you recover. Do not push yourself andlisten to your body. Comfortable resting position lRest on your side and make yourself comfortable by placing pillows under your abdomen and between your knees. lThis position is comfortable if you have stitches in either your abdomen or your perineum (the area between your legs). This is also a useful position for breast feeding your baby. Sitting lIt can be uncomfortable to sit if you are sore at the perineum. lTo ease the soreness while sitting, take two rolls of towels. Place them on the bed or a chair parallel to each other, with sucient gap between them.Sit with one thigh on one towel and the other thigh on the second towelsuch that your perineum is placed between the towels, not touching thebed or chair. lPerching on a wedge pillow can also help relieve the pressure o the perineum. Bladder awareness lMake sure you empty your bladder 6 to 8 hours after the birth especially if you have had an epidural. lThe midwife will measure the amount of urine you pass following the birth to ensure your bladder is working normally. lIf you have not emptied your bladder, inform the midwives on your ward. lRemember to empty your bladder regularly and completely. lDrink normal amounts, about 1.5 litres of liquids and aim to go the toiletevery 2 to 3 hours. lDo not 'stop and start' the flow of urine.Section 5. Looking after yourself following the birthpage | 66Bowel care lWhile having a bowel movement, try holding a wad of toilet paper or sanitary pad rmly in front of the back passage to give support to your stitches. lIf you have had a Caesarean birth, supporting your abdomen wound witha folded towel may help. lDo not strain. lBreathing out slowly as you move your bowel or pass urine, may help to ease any discomfort you may have. Hygiene lThere is an increased risk of infections with cuts, tears and stitches. lChange pads regularly. lShowering or pouring warm water over stitches after going to the toilet helps. Pat or blot the area dry. While in the hospital, bathe using a bidet or have a bath at home. Warm water and baths will also help soothe the area. lDo not use perfumed products such as vaginal deodorants, creams or talcum powder for 4 to 6 weeks. There is no benet to adding salt to yourbath water. lDo not use herbal or aromatherapy remedies without consulting a qualied therapist. Healthy Eating lEat well to help you recover. lIncrease your bre intake to prevent constipation as this in turn will prevent you from straining on your stitches and pelvic floor muscles. lAsk your pharmacist for product advice if you are prone to constipation. Care for tears/episiotomy lYour pelvic floor muscles can be injured during a vaginal birth when the baby's head is coming down the vagina and crowning. lSome women tear naturally while others have an episiotomy. An episiotomy is a surgical cut from the vaginal opening to the left or right side away from the anal sphincter muscles (back passage).page | 67lTears are graded from 1\u00a9 (rst degree) to 4\u00a9 (fourth degree). If you have a 3\u00a9 or 4\u00a9 tear the women's health physiotherapist will visit you in your wardto advise and treat you. lIt is vital that you start your pelvic floor exercises within the rst few daysor when you feel able. See below. lEven if you have not received stitches, you may experience some sorenessor pain in the perineal area. This can last from a few days to weeks. y ou may experience: ldiculty in walking, ldiculty in sitting comfortably, lproblems in passing urine, lfeelings of not wanting to breastfeed, lfeelings of being unable to care for your baby, or lfeeling irritable or tired. Pain killers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen can help. If the pain gets worse or if you have an unpleasant discharge ask your midwife, public health nurse or GP to check for signs of poor healing or infection.Redness may be a sign of infection. 'Cold therapy' such as ice packs or gel packs can relieve pain, swelling and ease discomfort.

Caring for a baby or babies is enjoyable, but also verydemanding. Getting to know your baby's/babies' needs and adjusting to theirpresence in your life takes time also. Exercises to help you to think about parenting Before your baby is born ask yourself \"How do I want my baby to see me?\" Think about what you would like your baby to say about you if he or she could chat with other babies at his rst birthday party? What are your dreams about becoming a parent? How can you best full these dreams? Another exercise that you might nd helpful is to write a parenting adjustment plan.

From your list choose the two most likely solutions to ease each of these problems. If you were to implement a solution what would be yourrst small step? Write it down now and implement it when the time comes. Another suggestion is to write a letter to your unborn baby telling them that you love them and look forward to being a loving parent to them. page | 79Helpful tips to enjoy parenthood Support: from family and friends Ask for and accept help and support from family and friends.
