It is an ancient Indian mind- body technique that mostly focuses on meditation, mindfullness, breathing, and activity or posture. All yoga exercises mild or with much exertion can improve the muscle tone and reduce fatigue and spasticity (Namjooyan, Ghanavati, Majdinasab, Jokari, and Janbozorgi, 2014). Meditation \"There are many types of meditation, but most have four elements in common: a quiet location with as few distractions as possible; a specific, comfortable posture (sitting, lying down, walking, or in other positions); a focus of attention (a specially chosen word or set of words, an object, or the sensations of the breath); and an open attitude (letting distractions come and go naturally without judging them)\"(NIH, 2017). Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is the art or science of extracting the scented oils from certain plants in order to balance and promote the order of the body, mind and spirit. \"Aromatherapy is a caring, hands-on therapy which seeks to induce relaxation, to increase energy, to reduce the effects of stress and to restore lost balance to mind, body and soul\", (NAHA, 2017). It can also give significant relief from anxiety. It works by stimulating the smell receptors in the nose and then sends impulses to the nerve endings the brain. The essential oils can used in a diffuser to disperse throughout a room. Combining Alternatives When you combine aromatherapy with meditation or yoga then the practice can be enhanced to a positive degree. There are combinations of oils that can be used together or alone to create that atmosphere that that one is looking for such as relaxation, mindfulness, deeper breathing techniques, and different energy levels.

Also they should make their meditation/yoga instructors aware of their condition. Topical use or ingestion for essential oils is not recommended without advisement of a professional. Some can cause skin irritation, (NIH, 2017). Inhalation through a diffuser should be the only means until full knowledge of the oils are known. Do not let children come in contact physically with any essential oil because they are usually concentrated. References F. Namjooyan, R. Ghanavati, N. Majdinasab, S. Jokari, M.
