Spectar* I. INTRODUCTION There is growing realization that in certain regions of the world the unusual virulence of AIDS is connected to the prevalence of insecurity and destabilizing conflict in a mutually reinforcing relationship. The recognition of AIDS as a security issue has significant implications for international law, politics, and diplomacy, particularly on the traditional conceptions of national interest, sovereignty, and non-intervention. This article examines the implications of the link between AIDS and security, focusing particularly on certain policy responses of key international actors, including the UN Security Council and the Clinton Administration. The article argues that the (belated) but nonetheless robust global response, particularly the Security Council resolution on AIDS, signified the on-going development of a new consensus about international governance in an age of galloping globalization and globetrotting super-viruses.' In Part II, the article focuses on the emerging consensus that AIDS is a security threat, in terms of human security2 as well as national and international security. With respect to human security, the article describes how AIDS weakens and destroys families, communities, economies and * Ph.D.1999, Claremont Graduate University; M.A.P. 1997, Claremont Graduate School; J.D. 1992, University of Maryland School of Law; M.A. 1992, George Washington University; M.B.A. 1989, Frostburg State University.

This article is an outgrowth of my notes for a seminar I taught in Princeton University during the spring of 2002 as well as my preparation for a human rights symposium at the University of Connecticut School of Law in December 2001. In addition, the article is also an extension of a lecture this author delivered in Princeton University titled, \"Non-State Violence, HIV-Pestilence & Other Emerging Threats: Rethinking National Interest, Sovereignty and Non-Intervention.\" (Sept. 2002). I would like to express my gratitude to all who participated in these events for their beneficial comments and thought provoking questions. I would also like to thank my former Princeton University students whose love of learning strengthened my faith in the future. Last but not least, I would like to thank my colleague, Professor Vitonio San Juan for his assistance in reviewing this and other articles by this author. 1. It is this sense that the dominant paradigm is shifting that gave rise to my co-optation and invocation of Alfred Lord Tennyson's \"The Passing of Arthur\" (Part 12 of the Idylls of the King) and its oft-quoted lines: \"The order changeth, yielding place to the new ...... 2.

REV. prospects for development in a mutually reinforcing cycle. The article also discusses the link between AIDS and conflict, focusing on the degree to which AIDS exacerbates national, regional, and global security dilemmas and undermines the international capacity to manage conflicts.3 Part III analyzes the emerging international response to the link between AIDS and security dilemmas as well as the potential ramifications for international theory and practice. With a focus on certain actions taken by the UN and the Clinton Administration, the article examines the impact of the global response on conventional understandings of the core concepts of national interest, sovereignty, and non-intervention. The article argues that the intractable nexus between pestilence and international security precipitated a rethinking of traditional conceptions of national interest, security, and sovereignty. Mounting an effective global response to AIDS as a security issue required a re-conceptualization of national interest and security, as well as an integration of national interest and international interest. The policy proposals and pronouncements of key world leaders revealed a reflective reappraisal and critical rethinking of priorities in the throes of the pandemic -a process that sparked an unusually high level of international cooperation and engendered a new consensus about the synergy between national and international interests. The article further contends that as the human needs/human rights concerns of AIDS victims are increasingly addressed by international organizations, the boundaries around the nation-state-reified by the institution of sovereignty-are under attack. Hitherto prohibited forms of intervention into erstwhile domestic zones4 are more tolerated, permissible, desirable, and imperative; states are modifying their conceptions of national interest to embrace a broader vision of 'world interest;' the concept of international security itself is undergoing substantial revision and 3.

See U.N. CHARTER, art. 2, para. 7. Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII.[Vol. 13:2 THE OLDE ORDER CRUMBLETH transformation, and the principle of non-intervention is gradually being weakened.5 In sum, the Article also argues that the global response to AIDS as a security issue was a significant challenge to the statecentric international system and a key test of its ability to develop a viable normative framework for addressing governance dilemmas catalyzed and exacerbated by runaway globalization. The Article argues that global response suggested the limits of the state-centric system, and its epistemological enabler, political realism, when it comes to resolving the challenges of the emerging global society. By the same token, the response vindicates the growing relevance of neoliberal institutionalist approaches in explaining the heightened international cooperation required to respond to dire human needs as the processes of globalization accelerate at breakneck speed. 11. AIDS & SECURITY AIDS is a security threat at both the micro-level and the macro-level, imperiling the domestic situation as well as the peace and tranquillity of international society. Due to the conterminous and mutually reinforcing symbiotic realities of HIV-pestilence, violence and security dilemmas in Africa,6 AIDS is a multidimensional security threat. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)7 and the International Crisis Group (ICG) identified several important ways in which AIDS threatens security. The pandemic is concomitantly: (1) a personal security issue; (2) an economic security issue; (3) a community security issue; (4) a national security issue; and (5) an international security issue.9 The first three above are, taxonomically, human security issues, whereas the last two are the more traditional or conventional global security issues. While these threats are discussed separately, it should be noted that they are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. 5. In a lecture at Princeton University, the author argued that much like microbial pestilence, the growing threats posed by terrorists and other violent non-state actors require a proactive and multi-level internationalist foreign policy. To protect and defend our way of life, the U.S. cannot afford to ignore seemingly local problems in 'distant' lands as these issues can fester like a sore wound and eventually wind up infecting us. Thus even as the U.S. must engage in robust and necessary self defense involving the use of force, I contend that other and equally vital dimensions of \"self-defense\" require perennial and preemptive assessment, engagement and intervention. I advocated a strategy that included \"multiple war-heads\" some to be launched against poverty, pestilence, ignorance, oppression and other factors exacerbating human insecurity. See J.M.

AIDS & Human Security There is growing recognition that AIDS constitutes a serious human security threat, precipitating severe personal, social, cultural, and economic dislocations that manifest themselves on the global level. As the world awakens to this catastrophe, it is becoming even more apparent that human security is an inextricable aspect of international security. Yet, the notion of human security is itself relatively new in mainstream international political and diplomatic discourse. Commentators such as Peter Stoett have put forth a conception of human security that includes \"analyses of those contemporary insecurities which affect us all, as individuals and as part of a global ecosystem.\"10 The term has even found its way into the lexicon of James Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, who has urged states to rethink their approach to security by embracing a focus on human security and its relationship to sustainable development: Security develops from within societies. If we want to prevent violent conflict, we need a comprehensive, equitable, and inclusive approach to development. ...Security, empowerment and opportunity must be recognized as key to freedom from poverty -just as freedom from poverty must be recognized as key to security.\" Consequently, Wolfensohn urges development and aid agencies to give careful thought to \"the nature of human security.\"'2 On the human security plane, AIDS damages the individual and family, and, the disease also ravages economies and communities.'3 HIV/AIDS obliterates advances in health, life expectancy, and infant mortality; imperils agricultural and food production; fractures families and communities; and robs 10.

Thus, instead of reaching and exceeding the mid sixties by 2010-2015, as would have occurred in the absence of AIDS, life expectancy will regress on average to forty-seven years.16 In addition, personal household income has fallen by as much as 25% in certain areas in a continent where three-quarters of the people are surviving on less than $2 per day.' The pandemic is having a particularly brutal impact on Africa's children and their prospects or dreams for a better future. Child mortality rates are rising in countries with a high prevalence rate. For instance, up to 70% of deaths of Zimbabwean children under five is attributable to AIDS.'s In 1998, nine out of ten children under fifteen that were infected with AIDS were Africans. Additionally, about 95% of all AIDS orphans have been African.9 More than one child in every ten has lost a mother to AIDS, and, by 2010, there will be about forty million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa largely because of AIDS.2\u00b0 As a consequence of these threats to personal security, fissures between social and ethnic groupings may be worsened thus potentially undermining the overall security situation.2 Additionally, as AIDS manifests itself as a threat to personal security, there may be an upsurge of economic migrants and refugees.22 Furthermore, children without jobs and prospects are more susceptible to joining or being forced to join local paramilitary groups.23 14.

As an economic threat, the pandemic is having a devastating impact on Africa's economy and development prospects.24 The pandemic imperils human capital and natural resource development as well as business investment-the critical pillars of national economies.25 The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has dubbed AIDS a \"destabilizing factor\" because as parents and workers are felled by disease, the \"structures and divisions of labour in households, families, workplaces and communities are disrupted.26 This especially impacts women in developing countries who bear additional burdens due to these dislocations and disruptions.27 AIDS also reduces income levels, impedes economic growth, and damages the social fabric.28 The pandemic has led to a spate of absenteeism, lower productivity, higher overtime costs, escalating death benefits, excessive health expenditures,9 and additional costs for recruiting and training new employees to replace the dead and dying.3\u00b0 As AIDS attacks the nerve centers of Africa's economy, the impact on the labor pool or human capital is particularly far reaching. Since AIDS in Africa kills most of the victims in their productive years (ages twenty-five to forty-four) the pandemic has attenuated the class of skilled labor such as teachers,\" doctors, nurses, small business owners, and other members of the managerial and professional elite.32 In the most affected African countries, the labor pool is expected to be 10-22% smaller, reducing the workforce by about 11.5 million persons.: The pandemic is rapidly decimating key sectors in African economies such as agriculture, mining, and transportation.' Agricultural output is increasingly in jeopardy as millions of farm workers have died and continue 24. See, e.g., Spectar, Hybrid Horseman, supra note 13. 25.

The citizens are aware of the increase in illness and death, the stigma associated with it; and lack of leadership leads to blame.48 In addition, as the citizenry becomes increasingly restive, the risk of \"communal violence\" against suspected disease carriers is increasingly likely.9 It is also increasingly apparent that AIDS thrives in conditions of socio- economic instability and insecurity.\u00b0 Marginalized persons (migrant workers, refugees, ostracized minorities, etc.) subjected to \"socioeconomic insecurity\" are more susceptible to infection and are just as likely to go without treatment.5 The lack of economic security also propels some people into the sex trade and its attendant health risks.52 As the pandemic advances, it exacerbates conditions of socioeconomic instability and insecurity, thereby perpetuating a pernicious cycle of pestilence and high prevalence.3 B.

Consequently, Susan E. Rice, the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, called AIDS \"the greatest threat ever to Africa's security and potential prosperity.57 In the same vein, the Zambian representative to the Security Council called the pandemic \"a threat to [African countries] very survival as viable nations.\"\" The AIDS pandemic has devastated African military personnel and thereby contributed to the weakening of national security and stability in many African countries. In some sub-Saharan African countries, the ministries of defense reported \"averages of 20-40 percent positivity within their armed services.\" 59 Estimates indicate that as much as 50% of military personnel could be HIV positive in countries with adult prevalence rates higher than 20%.6o It is not uncommon for prevalence rates in the military to far exceed civilian rates.

These high HIV/AIDS infection rates among military personnel could precipitate national security threats as military command structures are diminished and destroyed by the pandemic.62 The increase in HIV-infected military personnel is steadily attenuating the ability of armed forces to protect their nations and preserve civil order as well as to have access to a healthy conscription pool.63 As the disease advances, militaries are likely to experience\"a debilitated leadership\" and they will fail to meet military needs and commitments.\" In addition to its impact on national security, it is increasingly apparent that the pandemic is a threat to international security and stability, even if security is defined conventionally. As awareness grew about the potential impact of AIDS on international security, the pandemic was referred to variously as: a \"real and present danger to world security;'65 \"the world's most dangerous insurgency;''6 a \"war more debilitating than war itself;\" 67 \"one of the most devastating threats ever to confront the world community;','6 and \"as RESPONSE] (citing UNAIDS, AIDS and the Military: UNAIDS Point of View, 2 (May 1998), available athttp:llwww.unaids.orgpublications/documents/sectors/military/militarypve.pdf/). 62.

The State Department concluded that the \"collective hopes of new markets, foreign investment and stable democracies\" could be threatened by the unbridled spread of HIV.73 The State Department cited the tragedy in Rwanda and the upheaval in the countries of the former Soviet Union as exemplars that illustrate how \"political instability and disease have reinforce[d] each other.,74 AIDS is an international security threat because by striking at military personnel and limiting the pool of qualified persons for peacekeeping functions,7\" the pandemic acts as \"an inhibitor of international response to security problems.\"76 It has been observed that nations ravaged by the epidemic may not be able to \"muster troops to keep peacekeeping commitments.\"77 The perceived link between AIDS prevalence and UN peacekeeping activities was brought to international attention, in large part, by Richard Holbrooke, former U.S. Ambassador to the UN.

Holbrooke told a UN Security Council gathering, that it was \"a fact\" and \"an unpleasant truth\" that due to lack of proper training, education, and prevention techniques, UN peacekeepers were \"spreading AIDS inadvertently.\" 8' As noted that peacekeepers and other international workers \"must be made to realize\" that in the AIDS virus, they faced \"as deadly an enemy as the traditional enemies they usually come in contact with.\" 82 Similarly, Dr. Peter Piot, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, told UN officials the link between HIV/AIDS and UN peacekeeping, was a \"significant\" problem.3 Although there are no comprehensive statistics concerning HIV and AIDS among UN peacekeepers, many believe \"the process of spreading is self-evident.\" In particular, it is alleged that peacekeepers spread AIDS through \"commercial sex with civilians.\"'5 Many of the world's 36,000 itinerant peacekeepers often \"attract women who are working full-time or part- time as prostitutes. '86 The purported link between AIDS and peacekeepers is strongest in Africa where the UN has deployed most of its peacekeeping operations.7 In the view of Anwarul Karim Chowdhury, Bangladesh's representative, Africa's armed forces and civilian law enforcement personnel were \"slumping as AIDS took a toll on their personnel.\"88 Since these forces played a crucial role in 78.

Due to the efforts of Holbrooke, Peter Piot and other leaders, UN members began to realize \"the supreme irony\" whereby the very UN peacekeepers charged with preventing conflicts, were actually spreading AIDS -\"a disease even more deadly than the conflicts themselves.\" 9 There was a growing realization that to ensure a first rate defense, a \"truly modem and effective military\" had to take AIDS education and prevention \"seriously.\" 9' It became clear that since AIDS was also a security threat, peacekeeping troops had to be as protected against \"enemies like AIDS,\" as against conventional military foes.92 C.

HIV is the leading cause of death in the region,99 responsible for the deaths of over fifteen million Africans since the onset of the pandemic.'0 The death toll continues to mount, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1998 alone, two million Africans died of AIDS, ten times the number who died in war.'0' Three years later, the estimated death toll from AIDS in Africa was about 2.3 million02 with some estimates as high as 2.5 million. Most of these fatalities (about 85%) occur in the crescent of states from Kenya to South Africa.103 Despite the high AIDS death toll and infection rates, it remains unclear whether the unusual virulence of AIDS in Africa is directly attributable to the prevalence of violent conflict or vice versa. Even if AIDS itself does not cause conflict, it clearly exacerbates the overall security situation and thereby contributes to atrophy and ensuing violence. In a speech to the UN Security Council, Mr. Annan summed up the nexus as follows: \"The breakdown of health and education services, the obstruction of humanitarian assistance, the displacement of whole populations and a high infection rate among soldiers- as in other groups which move back and forth across the continent-all these ensure that the epidemic spreads even further and faster.''\"\"4 The fiery mix of war and AIDS wrecks the lives of those least able to defend themselves in developing countries and totally frustrates the realization of fundamental human rights, including right to health.\"5 Africa's wars have \"seriously undermined Africa's efforts to endure long-term stability, prosperity and peace for its peoples,\"'06--and this is especially so in the context of the pandemic.

Many of these people had fled from rural areas where the pre-conflict HIV rate was about 1.3%.13 Similarly, a significant increase among pregnant women in Luanda, Angola, is believed to be linked, to the displacement of people precipitated by the Angolan civil war.3' 119.

The dramatic increase in HIV/AIDS prevalence in many refugee camps is fueled by dismal social conditions, including \"overcrowding, violence, rape, despair and the need to sell or give away sex to survive.\"'33 Additionally, the AIDS crisis in the Congo was reportedly \"exacerbated\" by the millions of Rwandan refugees who poured into the country.'34 Sudden and/or massive refugee flows have the potential of undermining the stability of the host states. The situation is especially grave when already marginal and unstable states are overwhelmed by large numbers of refugees \"mingled with (fleeing) combatants.\"'35 For example, in the African Great Lakes area, the mingling of combatant and non-combatant refugees following the upheavals in Somalia and elsewhere, destabilized neighboring Zaire and other countries. 136 The impact of huge refugee inflows on health and social well-being is particularly pronounced in Guinea-a country with the highest per capita refugee population worldwide. 137 About 10% of the population is war refugees fleeing Sierra Leone and Liberia,' and their presence is creating significant dislocations with implications for overall health and well-being. These \"long- term\" refugees have had a profound effect on Guinea's economy and resource by fueling rising unemployment and increasing the number of street children.

' Similarly, over half of Rwandan women who reported they had been raped stated the rape occurred during the course of the conflict.' Women and young girls raped by military men suffer more than just the immediate physical and psychological trauma: they are tragically exposed to a much higher risk of HIV/STD infections as the forcible, unprotected sex often leads to tom vaginal or anal tissue, creating an easy entry point for the virus.53 Among Rwandan women who had been raped, 17% were HIV-positive, as compared with 11% who had not.

The UN Secretary General Mr. Kofi Annan summed up the situation as follows: By overwhelming the continent's health services, by creating millions of orphans and by decimating health workers and teachers, AIDS is causing social and economic crises which in turn threaten political stability. It also threatens good governance, through high death rates among the elites, both public and private. And high infection rates in the police and armed forces leave African States ill equipped to face security threats. 156 The dovetailing of the human security threats and their impact on the national and international policies illustrates a new type of three-level game,157 marked by fluid interactions of the personal, the national and the international levels. By blurring the distinction between matters of local versus global concern, AIDS is a \"human security\" dilemma that is simultaneously a global security issue. II.

INT'L & COMP. L. REV. well as the UN Security Council resolution on HIV/AIDS, the article argues that a new consensus has emerged regarding the governance of global threats, such as AIDS. These new understandings integrate more seamlessly the national and the international interest with respect to the globalization of health. In addition, the heightened international coordination and cooperation on the AIDS problem is best explained by neoliberal institutionalist approaches as opposed to conventional realism. At first, the world reacted to the unfolding pandemic with a mixture of denial and defeatist despair.'59 The initial global response to the AIDS pandemic was slow, uncoordinated and many international agencies bickered with each other over turf.'60 In particular, many African governments were demobilized by a paroxysm of debilitating denial about the scale of the pandemic unfolding before them.'6' Additionally, for the first decade of the epidemic, HIV/AIDS was viewed as a health issue affecting mostly gays and drug users.6 To the chagrin of AIDS and human rights activists, a deafening silence enveloped the pandemic, as millions died around the world.63 Nevertheless, after being ignored or denied by many members of the international community during much of the eighties, the global AIDS pandemic and its wide-ranging ramifications have emerged as a key issue at the forefront of the global agenda. By the early nineties, African governments began to recognize HIV as \"a real threat to the continent's future.\"'1 To affirm their seriousness, African leaders meeting at an OAU summit committed themselves to \"exert all possible means to limit the spread and impact of the scourge.\"'165 The recognition of the ravaging AIDS pandemic as a security threat has created even more international attention, sparking \"a new surge of momentum\" and \"a wide-range of action to fight AIDS around the world.\"'166 The U.S. administration of William Clinton took a leadership role in rethinking and redefining U.S. national interests regarding international health, as well as in spurring a new global consensus about responding to AIDS as a security threat. Most significantly, the United States steered the Security Council towards the passage of a seminal resolution that crystallized and AIDS in Africa. See infra at part III.

Below, the article examines how the new global consensus about HIV-pestilence, as crystallized in large measure by the Council's resolution warrants a rethinking of several core concepts of international theory and practice, including concepts of national interest, security, sovereignty and the associated concept of non-intervention. A. National Interest & National Security National interest has often served as rationalization for the choices of statesmen, including their choice of particularly unpleasant courses of action. It appears as if the mere authoritative invocation of \"national interest\" by a statesperson is sufficient to chill debate on foreign policy questions and to affix the imprimatur of legitimacy on all actions, even including those that contravene principles of international law. Nonetheless, despite its common usage, the concept is often misunderstood. A particularly prevalent misconception relates to the frequent attribution of a reified and concrete meaning to the concept -a semantic transubstantiation that suggests orderings of national interest are largely impervious to the international ecosystem. After a brief examination of the historical meanings of the concept, the author will explore the case of the United States' response to AIDS to illustrate the process of re-conceptualization of national interest and the emergence of a new consensus about core priorities, values and interests. The article also argues that this re-conceptualization is best explained by neoliberal approaches that embrace the modification of core realist'67 variables as a result of continuous engagement in coordinated activity in response to a common problem. Traditional understandings of national interest and security are anchored to the realist doxology of international relations. Realism, which has been traced back to Machiavelli's politico-historical analyses, made its American debut in the work of Hans Morgenthau and Kenneth Waltz.'68 Since Machiavelli's seminal work about princely statecraft, national interest has been a sacerdotal pillar of foreign policy, rationalizing a potpourri of actions and inactions. Neo-realism has three fundamental properties: the nature of man is characterized by an endless desire for increasingly more power; all states regardless of their size or capability are identical in their fixation regarding a specific concept of national interest as a guide to their actions; and the nature of the state system imposes rational constraints on the unrestrained pursuit of conflicting national interests via the balance of power. 169 167.

As neo-realism developed into a problem-solving theory, history became a mere \"quarry providing [the] materials\" to demonstrate predictable variations on persistently recurring themes.7 The approach, which became increasingly ahistorical, \"dictates that, with respect to essentials, the future will always be like the past.\"'' Notwithstanding its purported value neutrality, neo-realism is also embedded with an inherent normativity and performs a \"proselytizing function\": the theory rests on the assumption that given the experiences of all actors within the system, they will all adopt the neo-realist formula as a road map. 172 Intrinsic to the neo-realist dogma is the notion that states act out of well- articulated and rationally derived interests in a process of calculation that is uninfluenced by moral or humanistic considerations. Waltz sums up the neo- realist conception of national interest as follows: [T]o say that a country acts according to its national interest means that, having examined its security requirements, it tries to meet them ... Entailed in the concept of national interest is the notion that diplomatic and military moves must at times be carefully planned lest the survival of the state be in jeopardy. ' For Waltz, the \"elusive notion of national interest\" is made clearer by comparing nations and corporations: the latter presumably \"seek to maximize expected returns\" while the former \"strive to secure their survival.\"'74 Nonetheless, despite this \"assumed interest\" it is difficult to generate \"useful inferences\" unless one can determine what steps are necessary for successful pursuit of the articulated interest. 175 Thus, to say a state seeks its own preservation or pursues its national interest is much more compelling if one can determine just what actions are necessitated by national interest.'76 As each state exercises its prerogative of choosing its own policies, choosing \"effectively requires 170, Id. 171.

The anarchic, ipso facto, self-help system, is also marked by a dearth of \"central authority and collective security,\" thus leading to the \"inherently competitive dynamics of the security dilemma and the collective action problem.\"' Given the prevailing conditions of self-help, state survival is the primordial value as \"survival is a prerequisite to the achievement of other ends.\"'\"0 In pursuit of self-interest, a state calculates its actions according to the situation in which it finds itself.' Thus, relative gains could be more significant than absolute ones because one's gain counter-balanced against others', impacts the ability to shift for oneself.\"2 Under the competitive neorealist schema, only \"simple learning or behavioral adaptation is possible; the complex learning involved in redefinitions of identity and interest is not.\"''83 Thus, in hobbesian'\" \"competitive\" schema (as well as in neoliberal \"individualistic\" security systems) power politics is inherently about \"efforts to manipulate others to satisfy self-regarding interests.\"185 However, realist conceptions of national interest fail to capture the dynamic process of reflectivity about the interest matrix, particularly in institutionally-bounded settings where coordination is imperative. The fact of interest re-conceptualization within the context of patterned interactions is more adequately accounted for in neoliberal institutionalist approaches. Unlike neo-realism, which tends to ascribe a \"low value on the normative and institutional aspects of world order,\"'86 neo-liberal institutionalism is more optimistic about the possibility of warm cooperation; additionally, neo-liberal internationalism neither excludes moral goals nor reduces everything to power equations.'7 Neoliberals challenge the realists' dim view of cooperation arguing that \"process can generate cooperative behavior,\" and that interests and identities can be transformed.'88 Neo-liberal institutionalists reject the notion of fixed exogenously structured interests, citing concepts such as 177.

With respect to AIDS, the global focus on HIV/AIDS as a security threat was spurred, in part, by a decisive rethinking of U.S. national interests with regard to international health and a more comprehensive view of nexus between national and international security, broadly conceived.0' The conceptions of U.S. national interest and security (traditional realist variables) were transformed by new understanding about the catastrophic potential of the AIDS, new knowledge about the processes of bio-globalization and visionary reflectivity regarding these new trends. New thinking about security in the vortex of the pandemic ushered in a novel \"consensus\"\"2' about imperative values intrinsic to the long term sustainability and governance of a nascent global society besieged by seemingly implacable microbial foes. In effect, the new thinking on international security in the era of AIDS was arguably fueled by a \"breakdown of consensus'209 about possibilities of statecentrism in the era of bio-globalization. Just as the collapse in consensus about the possibilities of Marxist-Leninism precipitated Gorbachev's perestroika,10 so too did the international community awaken to a new way of thinking about national and international interests in the era of globalization and a most ominous plague.

Redefining Interests & Priorities in a Changed World: The U.S. Case In the mid eighties, the Reagan and Bush administrations were in possession of highly classified intelligence reports about the potential scale and scope of the burgeoning AIDS pandemic.\" Yet there was a prevailing view among U.S. officials that AIDS in Africa and other developing countries was of very little concern to the United States.212 In other words, staving off the looming epidemic was not in the national interest, and hardly a subject for national security officials to devote significant attention. In fact, two CIA analysts, Katherine J. Hall and William L. Barrows, were rebuffed by the CIA when they sought agency backing to study the mushrooming pandemic.3 For a three year period (1987-1990), the CIA rejected requests for personnel and resources to study the epidemic, arguing that it was not an appropriate issue for intelligence agencies.214 By 1990, the CIA relented and it sanctioned an intelligence appraisal of the burgeoning epidemic.2\"' The resultant classified document titled \"The Global AIDS Disaster\" (Interagency Intelligence Memorandum 91-10005 of July 1991), predicted that AIDS will grow to catastrophic proportions with a projected 45 million infections by 2000.\"16 At about the same time, a World Health Organization (VHO) report predicted that that tens of millions would be infected and would eventually die by 2000.217 The CIA's report on the global AIDS disaster as well as other reports predicting similar calamities were reportedly greeted with \"indifference\" and inaction by Bush administration officials.\" The indifferent or lackluster U.S. response to AIDS in the Reagan and Bush administrations was, in part, a function of the conventionally myopic approach to assessing national interest. This traditional conception of national interest was wedded to the notion of narrow strategic issues related to power and positioning, as shaped by the post Cold War era. It was also fueled by a 211.

There was a sense that President Clinton would be both more internationalist and more pro-Africa in his articulation of foreign policy goals. These expectations were, for the most part, fulfilled; although, several contradictions and blunders marred Clinton's 219. See infra. 220.

The Clinton-Gore administration effectively presided over a dramatic redefinition of U.S. national interests in light of the new age of bio- globalization and ancillary governance dilemmas. The administration's redefinition of national interest with respect to the pandemic was partly fueled by \"new\" facts and findings about the interconnectedness of global processes, a greater appreciation of the challenges of global governance, as well as by the determined efforts ardent spokespersons with a deep concern for Africa. In effect, a paradigmatic re-interpretation of U.S. interests and obligations was increasingly evident throughout the Clinton Administration-a shift marked by a growing focus on a range of issues hitherto confined to the under valued realm of \"low politics.\" This transformation eventually culminated in U.S. leadership on the passage of the Security Council Resolution on HIV/AIDS and the emergence of a new global consensus on security. Clinton administration officials were spurred to action not just by data showing the extent of the pandemic, but by a growing understanding of the increasingly interconnected nature of the threats confronting the United States. In particular, U.S. policy makers were making new interconnections between the escalating threats posed by major infectious diseases (AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, and hepatitis) and a range of other U.S. interests in the age of globalization. The growing recognition and articulation of these interconnections increasingly shaped the development of U.S. foreign policy goals by senior officials. The public perorations of U.S. officials about the interconnections between infectious diseases, communications technology, mass migrations, and security in a closely connected globalizing planet provided evidence of critically reflective and \"self-conscious efforts\"27 to significantly change the prioritization of key U.S. interests. A close examination of the Clinton Administration foreign policy, especially from 1995-2000, reveals a marked shift in articulation of U.S. foreign policy goals -at least on the priority accorded issues of global health. The Clinton administration intentionally changed U.S. rhetoric, as well as diplomatic posturing on AIDS, paving the way for a surge of internationalist activism on a global scale. Partly due to strong presidential leadership, the 226.

REV. new conceptions of national interest, national security, and world interest were increasingly integrated into U.S. foreign policy pronouncements and positions. In addition, the Clinton administration provided commendable international leadership228 as it worked ensure the global diplomatic agenda included efforts to combat the global AIDS pandemic. By the mid-nineties, the Clinton administration was confronted with data about the scope and potential ramifications of the AIDS virus and other microbial threats.229 The administration was quickly spurred into developing a global effort to fight infectious diseases because it recognized the futility of unilateral efforts in an era of accelerating bio-globalization. It was apparent that the staggering costs of controlling the coming microbial threats far outstripped \"the means available to any one country or international organization to respond completely.\"230 In addition, a 1995 report by the National Science and Technology Council's Committee on International Science, Engineering and Technology (CISET) revealed that the annual aggregate cost to the United States for infectious diseases exceeded an estimated $120 billion.23\"' The Clinton Administration was also impelled to critically rethink national interest and security because of the confluence of related events, including the extant revolution in communications technologies (that made the world even smaller), as well as the quickening processes of globalization. Due to rapid technological growth and the increasing mobility of populations, threats that were once perceived as local could now have catastrophic consequences on a regional or global scale.232 As the pace of bio-globalization quickened, U.S. leaders recognized they had to adjust their conception of international security to reflect a new world of increasingly menacing globetrotting viruses. Wendy Sherman, a diplomat in the Clinton administration stated: 228. See id. The Clinton Administration's Africa record was occasionally marred by some notable failures and squandered opportunities.

Infectious microbes can easily travel across borders with their human or animal hosts, in the food and products we trade. No nation is impervious to these health threats. Beyond the terrible AIDS pandemic and the more exotic, publicized diseases such as the Ebola virus in the former Zaire, lie a wide range of microbiological threats.233 Noting that these diseases are \"the silent enemies of economic growth, national well-being and stability around the globe,\" Sherman observed that \"the threats they pose and the devastation they portend give reason to reexamine how we define 'national security.' 234 By the end of the nineties, the Clinton Administration was effectively treating emerging infectious diseases as growing global health threat capable of imperiling several U.S. national interests. The administration believed U.S. national interests were affected because infectious diseases are a challenge to health and economic productivity,3 as well as a danger to economic development and political stability abroad. 236 In addition, there are \"potential dangers of bio-terrorism,237 as well as the \"necessity of enhanced preparedness to safeguard the U.S. and the global community against the threat of infectious diseases.\" 238 Furthermore, the U.S. faces the challenge of mobilizing technical and financial resources \"to reduce human suffering and stem further disease transmission.'239 Additionally, intelligence reports began to indicate that AIDS and other ravaging epidemics will eventually be significant triggers of conflicts in the Third World, and, in some cases, determine the results of conflicts in the near future.240 Also, the potential of destabilizing mass migrations spurred by disease and conflict was a source of concern to some analysts.24' For these reasons, the Clinton Administration gradually expanded its notions of national security to embrace the fight against 233.

As Samuel Berger, national security adviser to former president Clinton stated: We understand, I think, ... [in a] global age, and a global economy that instability in other parts of the world which can lead to war and conflict can have a direct effect on the United States. And I think we have an obligation to act with others to try to both deal with the consequences and increase the degree of education and prevention to try to slow this down.245 Besides the policy-oriented reasons for the reformulation of U.S. interests, the \"self-conscious\" reflectivity and zealous advocacy of key U.S. spokespersons catalyzed the process of rethinking and reassessment. The most ardent articulator of Clinton Administration policy on the global pandemic was Richard Holbrooke, a former UN Ambassador. It can be argued that Holbrooke, with some assistance from Vice President Gore, was the pivotal actor in the redefinition of U.S. national interests in this area. For Ambassador Holbrooke, the battle against AIDS was clearly the premier issue of the global agenda: Of all the problems that we face in the world today and there are many-the conflicts we are here to try to prevent or 242.

Such thinking was imperative to grapple with the \"the greatest global pandemic of our time,\" which had quickly morphed into diplomatic, economic, trade, security and human rights issue.248 Holbrooke maintained the global scope of the pandemic necessitated concerted international action: AIDS is not just the problem of a single country. It is not just an African problem. It cannot be treated simply as a problem of a single continent. In a world defined by globalization and interdependence-two of the catchwords of the modem era-we can't do triage by countries or continents. And we can't simply focus on economic interdependence. We have to recognize that while interdependence gives economic opportunities, it also can pose global threats. You cannot deny AIDS a visa; you cannot embargo it or quarantine it; you cannot stop it at a border. That's why we must work together.49 Besides redefining its own strategic priorities to include the war against HIV/AIDS, the U.S. urged other nations to make AIDS a priority. President Clinton placed infectious disease in his agenda during both of his African trips,25\u00b0 where promised assistance to fight AIDS and challenged Africans to take responsibility.

For example, in the United States, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott stated that he did not consider AIDS to be a threat to national security and he accused the White House of playing politics with the issue. 254 In addition, while testifying before the Senate Relations Committee, Holbrooke disclosed that the U.S. \"idea\" to hold a special Security Council session on AIDS was \"initially met with some resistance, including from inside the U.S. Mission.'25 The dissenting views notwithstanding, U.S. leadership on this issue was clearly causing the rest of the world to fall in line. Partly as a result of U.S leadership, the pandemic was one of the main issues in the global diplomatic agenda in between 1999 -2001 ,256 as evidenced by proclamations in major intemational conferences in from Durban to Okinawa.57 In what was arguably most visible sign in the on-going redefinition of U.S. national interest ordering the Security Council with very strong U.S. nudging took up a health-only matter for the first time in summer 2000.258 252.

The Security Council's First Health-Only Resolution & Its Impact In a clear demonstration of its revised issue-prioritization, the U.S. strongly supported and even championed Security Council involvement in the AIDS crisis. At the 4086th Security Council Meeting on January 10, 2000, the United States challenged the international community to rethink the pandemic as a security issue. The United States urged the Security Council to \"work toward a resolution that describes and responds to the impact of AIDS as a cause and consequence of security crises.\"'259 In particular, the United States urged the Council to do more to \"address the tragic relationship between AIDS, conflict, and peacekeeping.\"\"26 The new focus on AIDS in the Security Council was in large measure the product of the joint efforts of Richard Holbrooke and Albert Gore, both of whom were determined to approach the matter multilaterally within the framework of the UN system.261 Given their shared preference for concerted and coordinated multilateral action, the duo was able to lead the Council through uncharted waters as the debate proceeded on this unprecedented resolution. With Holbrooke and Gore leading the charge and declaring AIDS a threat to international security, other states took their cue from robust U.S. leadership, thus precipitating a series of similar proclamations.262 As Mr. Gore stated, AIDS is a security issue because it \"strikes at the military, and subverts the forces of order and peacekeeping.263 In his groundbreaking peroration at the Security Council meeting on AIDS, Mr. Gore implored the international community to \"wage and win a great and peaceful war of our time -- the war against AIDS.2\"I The unanimous resolution of July 18, 2000 sought to intensify the war against AIDS by calling on countries to design and implement long-term strategies to stave off the pandemic.65 The resolution noted that the Security Council was \"deeply concerned by the extent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic worldwide, and by the severity of the crisis in Africa in particular.\"'266 In the 259.

In addition, the proponents were able to overcome the resistance of those who viewed this resolution as an unwarranted and unauthorized interference in the domestic jurisdiction of UN Member States. Supporters of the resolution viewed its passage as a clarion call in the battle against AIDS; they rejected the imputation that it was merely a symbolic gesture presented with plenty of pomp and protocol. The resolution was clearly \"historic for the Security Council\" and it constituted an \"important benchmark in the process\" of fighting against AIDS. 272 Additionally, supporters argued the measures in the resolution were \"significant steps\" 273 and even \"ground-breaking.'274 As a delegate to the Security Council stated, the importance of the debate \"lies in raising awareness\" of the devastation and of the \"greater threat ahead if effective action is not taken.\"275 Furthermore, supporters hoped that resolution would \"go a long way towards ending'271 the link between AIDS and peacekeeping, especially to the extent that humanitarian aid workers, military personnel properly trained in HIV prevention and behavioral change could serve as force for prevention.277 For his part, Richard Holbrooke sought U.S. congressional support for implementation of the resolution, particularly with respect to the education of peacekeepers about the dangers of AIDS.278 As if to accentuate the new consensus about U.S. perception of its interests, Holbrooke vowed before Congress that \"the U.S. will never again vote for a peacekeeping resolution that does not require specific action by the UNDPKO to prevent AIDS from spreading by or to peacekeepers.279 However, some were miffed by what they saw as the resolution's excessively narrow focus and the missed opportunities with respect to dealing with the wider issues relating to treatment equity and poverty-as-a-pandemic- purveyor. Despite the broad support for the U.S.-backed approach, some wondered whether the U.S. had defined the issue too narrowly, addressing only U.S. interests while deftly ignoring the larger issues.

The delegate from Zimbabwe expressed his disappointment with this limited approach stating, \"It remains painfully clear that the profit motive takes precedence over humanity's well-being.282 While some saw the focus on peacekeeping as limiting, Holbrooke took the view that the resolution was an important and targeted step that focused on a key aspect of the problem. Even as he acknowledged that the resolution primarily focused on peacekeeping, Holbrooke maintained that \"the ultimate goal must be to increase international intensity and coordination against HIV/AIDS across the board.\" 283 B. Sovereignty The new global understanding of AIDS as a security threat and the global response thereto warrants a rethinking of the principle of sovereignty, particularly as it relates to the putative exclusivity of UN Member states' dominion over so-called \"matters essentially within the [member states'] domestic jurisdiction.282 The principal argument is that due to the extant and emerging threats in the age of bio-globalization, the archaic and static realist conceptions of sovereignty must be modified or discarded in favor of dynamic institutionalist approaches that connect the domestic and international planes in a seamless framework of universal human rights and responsibilities. Below, the article explores the nature of sovereignty and the necessity of a re- conceptualization in the age of globalization, particularly in light of the UN resolution on AIDS. At the dawn of the seventeenth century and prior to the emergence of the nation-state as we know it, Jean Bodin set forth a doctrine of sovereignty in which the monarch was an absolute ruler within his/her dominions, but equal externally with respect to other sovereigns.2\"' Only by voluntary agreement could the sovereign monarch incur obligation from abroad.286 Following the emergence of the territorial state and the creation of the state system, the 280.

HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY, supra note 285, at 4.[Vol. 13:2 THE OLDE ORDER CRUMBLETH absolutist notions of sovereignty postulated by Bodin became \"the most important notion for both domestic and international politics.287 Consequently, Stanley Hoffman referred to sovereignty as \"the prevalent structure of the international system,\" and he summed up the last two and half or three centuries of international relations as \"the age of sovereignty.'28 Similarly, Falk acknowledges that the predominant world ordering logic289 since Westphalia has been the statist framework of Bodin and subsequently Emmerich de Vattel.29 Many commentators continue to wrestle with the \"bothersome concept'291 of sovereignty, bemoaning the lack of consensus regarding its implications for world order and justice.292 According to Kenneth Waltz, the concept of sovereignty suggests that each state \"unit\" is like every other in so far as each state is \"an autonomous political unit.293 The sovereign state determines on its own accord, the strategies necessary for coping with its internal and external problems, including whether seek outside assistance and, in doing so, to voluntarily constrain its freedom by making commitments or concessions to other states.294 As Falk observes, the statist logic, associated with the \"will of the territorial sovereign state\" has resulted in the government of the state acting as the de jure exclusive agent with regard to formulating the will of the state in external relations.295 On the domestic front, the principle of sovereignty \"signified the establishment of hierarchical patterns of authority\"; at the international level, sovereignty symbolized the putative \"equality of autonomous actors, analogous to the status of property holders in Roman private law.'296 At the core of the principle is the notion that the state \"is 287.

In its radical form, the institution of sovereignty \"serves to perpetuate modem nation-states\" to the detriment of social justice and human rights.29' For example, commentators who adopt a maximalist view of genocide see the nation state, and the system that supports it, as an accomplice in the deaths of millions either deliberately or unwittingly.299 It is argued that under the guise of sovereignty, states commit or encourage the commission of large scale atrocities, or permit the exacerbation of catastrophes such as the AIDS pandemic.300 Thus, Peter Stoett concludes, the \"reluctance of some Asian and African governments to respond to the health needs of AIDS patients could be viewed as genocidal.\"'' Similarly, Stoett argues the eleven million children who die each year from easily preventable diseases can be considered victims of \"silent genocide,\"32 or what Henry Shue dubbed the \"Holocaust of Neglect.\"\"03 In the same vein, Leo Kuper remarked: \"[T]he sovereign state claims, as an integral part of its sovereignty, the right to commit genocide ...and the United Nations, for all practical purposes, defends this right.\"304 Thus, when used as a shield, sovereignty is perceived as a threat to enforcement of international human rights and the creation of a just and sustainable world order. Consequently, it is no surprise that some maintain sovereignty is \"an oppressive institution that aids the wealthy\" and/or\"precludes genuine international harmony.\"305 Exploiting the legal protections putatively afforded sovereignty, certain ruling elites effectively enjoy sanctuary or immunity from external intervention even as they foment or facilitate massive human rights abuses. In fact, gross human rights abusing states \"typically\" hide behind sovereignty and nonintervention as they demand all outsiders refrain from direct or indirect interference with their so-called 297.

Such a system exhibits only a modest capacity for international cooperation and coordination. The distribution of power and authority, as well as the organization of human effort, is overwhelmingly guided by the selfish drives of nations.3\u00b00 Sovereignty's doppelganger, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign states, taken to its logical and perverse extreme poses a clear and implacable threat to the promotion of international human rights. The values imputed to sovereignty \"a legal license to do your own thing\" and its associated principle nonintervention (\"an injunction to mind your own business\") do not meld well with human rights concerns that require each to be her sister's keeper.\" Nonetheless, some argue that moderate expressions of sovereignty constitute a positive good for a system of states with unequal capabilities. As Wendt argues, the sovereign state depends on certain \"intersubjective understandings and expectations\" -leading to a particular type of community marked by a \"mutual recognition of one another's right to exercise exclusive political authority within territorial limits.\"3' Sovereignty norms are\"presupposed by an ongoing artifact of practice\"; states thus act against the background of and thus replicate \"shared norms\" about understandings of the meaning of sovereignty.\" Therefore, the argument goes, to the degree that states \"successfully internalize sovereignty norms they will be more respectful toward the territorial rights of others.\"'312 In this regard, David Strang argues that sovereignty has a constraining institutional effect to the degree that it increases the protection weak states [Vanuatu, Bahamas etc.] receive inside as opposed to outside \"communities of recognition.3t3 As states grapple with new emerging threats that defy borders, such the AIDS pandemic and other problems in the age of galloping globalization, the 307.

REV. traditional realist conception of sovereignty is severely wanting.314 Conventional realists consider sovereignty the \"defining feature\" of the international political system\"5 and they effectively ascribe timeless features to sovereignty as a seminal, causal and analytical variable. At the same time, the power of the sovereign to determine, and act, according to national interests is accorded maximal deference, even when such actions contravene international legality. Realists often overplay the significance of sovereignty and perhaps as a result, overstate distinctions between hierarchy in the domestic setting marked by formal government, law, order and organized force and the international setting ostensibly marked by anarchy or the absence of hierarchy, norms and common values.\"6 Nonetheless, it is wrong-headed to equate the sovereignty of states with their ability to act arbitrarily or according to their wills and wishes.3\"7 International cooperation is, or should be, possible because in spite of sovereignty, the system is not boundlessly anarchic. Even Bodin recognized the sovereign's power was not unlimited, because God, natural law, and, the law of nations bound the prince.31 While sovereignty may frustrate the creation of a hegemonic central authority, it does not preclude significant levels of international coordination and cooperation common problems. Sovereign states are sometimes \"constrained\" to act or not act in certain ways; they may be sovereign yet dependent on others and, of course, they may be impacted by the conduct of other sovereign actors.3'9 There is substantial cooperation in international politics; states conclude alliances or treaties, exploit common resources and assign exclusive property rights despite the lack of a world government.32\u00b0 Additionally, states surrender certain rights to federations or supranational institutions and sometimes bear significant costs and hardship \"to vindicate particular fundamental principles of international conduct.\"32' Further, sovereignty, like other basic realist/neorealist variables such as anarchy, security, rationality and power can be modified322 by social 314.

To cope with the emerging threats of the 21st century, it will be necessary to challenge the realists' static conception of sovereignty, and ipso facto, to embrace a dynamic institutionalist perspective. Liberal institutionalists view sovereignty as a \"diffuse concept\" that is intrinsically\"part of a larger network of interstate communication and regime formation.''324 The liberal institutionalist approach accounts for an evolutionary notion sovereignty and provides a viable framework for thinking about sovereignty and justice. Even as the territorial sovereign state \"keeps proliferating,\"325 the nature and quality of coeval sovereignty is not static and the institution appears to be undergoing significant transformations. Although the institution of sovereignty remained relatively unchanged in the first three centuries of the post Westphalia system,326 the fallout of World War II hastened the pace of change. In the wake of the Nazi horrors, there was a \"most radical\" shift as many commentators abandoned their unquestioning \"reverence\" for absolute sovereignty.327 It became increasingly apparent that traditional notions of sovereignty had to be modified, particularly in instances when significant outside intervention was required to protect people from gross human rights violations.32 Consequently, the doctrine of sovereignty was changed dramatically by the arrival of the United Nations on the scene and related institutions bent on promoting and securing universal human rights.329 After the debut of the post War human rights institutions, matters such as \"the proper limits of state sovereignty\" increasingly became the central focus of most international institutions.33 It is often said the domain of international human rights is, among other things, an on-going and escalating \"attack upon the concept of state sovereignty as traditionally conceived\" involving among other entities, \"a spirited movement\" of nonstate actors that transcend political boundaries.33\"' 323.

As Sir Hersch Lauterpacht had observed, the dominant trend of the last half of the twentieth century involved the sovereign state giving way to the \"sovereignty of humankind.'339 For Lauterpacht, the recognition of human rights in the post World War 1I era was \"a brake upon exclusive and aggressive nationalism, which is the obstacle, both conscious and involuntary, to the idea of world community under the rule of law.\"'34 The process of fundamental re-conceptualization of sovereignty that 'began' in the immediate post war era continues to gather momentum as it is catalyzed by a convergence of forces and processes in the age of bio-globalization. Although Article 2(7) of the UN charter appears to firmly proscribe intervention of internal matters of states, new interpretations of that provision may be emerging in the age of globalization. In fact, many concede that definitions of the \"sovereign rights of states\" or what is \"essentially within the domestic jurisdiction\" are continuously changing.341' To cope with the new dilemmas of sovereignty and article 2(7) in the age of globalization, international lawyers, publicists and other commentators need to revise and update their understandings of sovereignty. Some publicists and commentators are already taking up the challenge of re-working sovereignty for a new day. Ivan Simonovic argues that, in the age of globalization, \"the old paradigm of international relations,\" based on assumptions about autonomous sovereign states that only factor their national interest calculations \"does not reflect the present reality of international relations.\"'342 Simonovic puts forth a new conception of sovereignty that builds on the concept of the equality of states: as globalization constrains states and transforms patterns of interactions between individuals, states, and international organizations, the principle of the sovereign equality of states should be transformed into the \"principle of equally reduced sovereignty.\"'343 Simonovic endorses the role of international law and organizations in the governance of globalization, particularly with respect to threats such as environmental degradation, international crime, terrorism, AIDS, and human rights violations.3 In this context, Simonovic argues UN involvement is a necessary and \"significant step\" in managing the problems associated with 338.

C. International Security The invigorated global response to AIDS was possible largely as a result of the broadening of the definition of security. To form a global consensus about the need for concerted international action, members of the Security Council discarded traditional notions of security, recasting the concept in light of exigent realities as well as alternative visions of the future. Given the exigencies of the pandemic, proponents of the resolution contended members had to be willing to \"see security through a new and wider prism, and forever after, think about it according to a new, more expansive definition.346 Although AIDS was not \"an issue of strategic security in the classic sense,\" 347 proponents argued that world community needed to \"reshape\" thinking about definitions of security. \" It was also apparent that unless the matter could be defined in ways that suggested a legitimate role for the Security Council, the Members would not agree that it was appropriate for the Council to discuss a health issue, much less pass a health-only resolution.9 It was therefore necessary to redefine the AIDS issue in such a way that UN members could make the case that the UN was acting within its constitutional mandate. The task was rendered more difficult because UN founders did not envision, nor provide explicitly, a role for the UN in matters of health. Customarily, matters related to health and other social issues are generally considered to be within the competence of the World Health Organization or reserved for the Economic and Social Council.\u00b0 In effect, throughout its history, the Council confined itself to a\"classic security agenda built upon common efforts to resist aggression, and to stop armed conflict.,35' Until the development and acceptance of a broader vision of security, it was unlikely that AIDS would be accepted as an appropriate subject for a high level Security Council discussion.352 Prior to and during Council debate, more and more world leaders endorsed a \"new agenda for world security\" that involved a redefinition of 345.

In particular, James Wolfensohn of the World Bank urged the international community to \"think beyond battalions or borders\" when thinking about security.356 Wolfensohn called on all to focus on \"human security,\" to increase the efforts aimed at winning the battle against poverty.357 We will be judged on whether we understand the nature of human security and sustainable development ..Security develops from within societies. If we want to prevent violent conflict, we need a comprehensive, equitable, and inclusive approach to development. A culture of prevention needs to permeate our work. Security, empowerment and opportunity must be recognized as key to freedom from poverty -just as freedom from poverty must be recognized as key to security.\"' In his usually trenchant prose, Holbrooke summed it up thusly: \"post- Cold War international security is about more than guns and bombs and the balance of power.\"'359 It was necessary to think of international security in broader terms, in terms that legitimized the Council's intrusion into the health matters of Members -in seeming disregard for article 2(7) of the Charter. The efforts to rethink security were so successful that some members resorted to hyperbole, dubbing AIDS an \"aggressor.\"36 In urging a re-conceptualization of security, a UN representative argued that the pandemic was the functional equivalent of an armed aggressor and ipso facto, 353.

AIDS and armed conflict, with all their impact on Africa, should be accorded the status of an international security agenda item, falling within the competency of the Security Council.6 In sum, in light of the new consensus about international security, it was argued that the machinery of the United Nations \"created to stop wars\" should now be summoned in a \"common cause, to defeat a common foe\" -the AIDS virus.162 The passage of the resolution constituted \"a benchmark in the evolution of the Security Council,\"'363 as well as the recognition of the changed environment. In effect, the vote was a \"recognition that AIDS is as great a security challenge\" as any other conventional security threat in UN history. 64 D.

The resolution sparked a heightened level of international cooperative activity and coordination that in turn have given rise to further expectations about future cooperation about a wide range of joint problems. The resolution also had a transformative and normative impact on international diplomatic discourse, fueling an intensified and unprecedented level of cooperation and coordination regarding global health. Supporters saw the resolution as \"only a beginning\"'365 and they hoped similar resolve would be exhibited in upcoming UN fora. In particular, the stage was set for Members to \"take further action\" at the upcoming Millennium Summit and in the General Assembly's special session on HIV/AIDS. 366 As expected, the UN General Assembly followed the Security Council's lead by adopting the \"Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS,\" adopted during the General Assembly's Special Session on June 27,2001.

With respect to national security, the resolution exhorted members to have in place by 2003, national strategies to address spread of HIV among national uniformed services, where required, including armed forces and civil defence force, and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency, humanitarian, disaster relief and rehabilitation.369 To realize the goals in the both the Council's resolution and the UNGA declaration, the UNAIDS Secretariat established a global initiative on HIV/AIIDS and security with the goal of strengthening partnerships with co- sponsors, especially in areas plagued by conflict.37\u00b0 UN efforts to stem the pandemic intensified following the resolution, as evidenced by the dissemination of hundreds of thousands of condoms to peacekeepers in war- torn areas around the world. 3 367.

In addition to the interests listed above, the U.S. posture also served the goal of showing commitment to Africa at a time when U.S. Congress members and AIDS activists were becoming restive. It was thought that showing such leadership during the \"Month of Africa\" was a sign that America was once again reasserting its power and influence in the UN.79 In lauding the resolution, members gave credit to the United States, with one representative expressing hope that \"the pioneering initiative of the United States will be pursued by others in justified earnestness.''38\u00b0 By highlighting international attention on African issues in the Security Council discussion of AIDS, development, and war, the Council was helping to \"put to rest the canard that Africa doesn't matter; to refute the belief that the international community has one set of rules for Europe or Asia and another for Africa.\"'' It was hoped that the Council's action would precipitate worldwide attention to the needs of Africa in the throes of the global AIDS crisis.3\"' Proponents of the resolution also expected that the new focus on African conflict zones would lead the UN to \"assist African governments in devoting more resources to tackling economic and social problems,\" and thereby ameliorate the epidemic.383 Similarly, others hoped that the Council's involvement could \"provide the moral and political commitment\" needed to secure resources to support civil society initiatives efforts such as the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa. \" The intensified cooperation was also born out of a re-learning of the truism regarding the interconnectedness of the human condition, especially as a result of new communications technologies and the realities of bio- globalization. Thus, James Wolfensohn exhorted the international community to \"mobilize\" not just for a \"war against AIDS,\" but for \"a war for Africa's future and for our own.\"'385 Similarly, Mark Malloch Brown, Administrator of UNDP, argued that the international community needed to take concerted action because failure to act could endanger everyone: \"Today, this is Africa's 378.

Many expect that in going forward, the Security Council, UNAIDS, and other international agencies would play an even more activist role in coordinating the efforts to combat and contain AIDS and other the pandemics. Potential roles for the UN could include the establishment of a Security Council mechanism for close cooperation and coordination with UNAIDS, involving regular open briefing sessions with the Executive Director of UNAIDS;388 reinforcing UNAIDS through a \"strengthened mandate, greater resources and enhanced coordinating authority for its Executive Director;\"39 the creation of a central register or clearinghouse to monitor and harmonize global efforts to fight the pandemic;390 a UN campaign to raise funds by \"assessing contributions to Member States according to their economic level\"39' as well as voluntary \"contributions by universities, research centres, companies, NGOs and individuals.392 The Security Council resolution and subsequent proposals for greater cooperation derived thereunder generally received broad support, notwithstanding concerns about sovereignty and intervention In the euphoria of the moment, UN representatives seemingly sought to outdo one another in touting this new era of cooperation. One UN representative saw the new cooperative relations in terms of international legal or moral obligation, maintaining that the world community \"owe[s] it to the African people affected by this scourge to deploy every means necessary to defeat the pandemic and transform a legacy of despair into an endowment of hope.\"'393 The new and broader vision of human security was touted as the true dimension of security394 as opposed to the narrower or constricted antiquated 386.

In this new epoch, the international community had to credibly address issues of development because it was clear \"the world would not be a secure place if women and children had no security of their individual self.'395 Another delegate member noted the link between peace and development, calling them \"two sides of the same coin;\" true peace was impossible without \"economic and social progress for all people.396 The Malian delegate remarked that peace and security \"depended on the socio- economic realities of nations\"-not just on the absence of war.397 Since AIDS \"truly threatened the very basis of human security,\" an effective war against AIDS was a precondition for peace and sustainable development in Africa.398 As many UN representatives spoke eloquently about the new-fangled dawn of intensified international cooperation, they unwittingly gave credence to the views of those who felt the UN system was overreaching. While these holistic visions of international security and enhanced international cooperation may indeed augur well for the future of humankind, some observers were alarmed by the prospect increasingly activist international organizations. Below, the Article examines some of the concerns triggered by this new revolution of expanding and indeterminate obligations. E. Intervention & Humanitarian Intervention Given the expanded commitments, expectations and potential obligations that could be triggered by a UN resolution on a health-only matter, some commentators were concerned the Security Council resolution could infringe on national sovereignty. Several countries raised objections to what they viewed as U.S.-led interference in their internal affairs.399 The Russian and the Indonesian delegates were especially skeptical of U.S. motives, expressing concerns that the resolution may be used to infringe upon the sovereignty of UN member states.4\u00b0\u00b0 As the Indonesian representative to the UN stated, \"My delegation holds the view that linking HIV to international peacekeeping operations raises serious questions.\"'' Additionally, ambassadors whose nations provide peacekeeping troops complained that the U.S., which had relatively fewer UN peacekeeping soldiers, was overstepping its bounds by trying to use the Security Council resolution to mandate training and education for others.4\"2 395.

Likewise, some in the U.S. are inherently suspicious of what they perceive to be UN activism, particularly far reaching resolutions that could threaten sovereignty and usurp independence. There is simmering bitterness and even resistance from certain quarters in the far right of the political spectrum against creeping cosmopolitanism and the purported loss of precious sovereignty. In particular, some fear that U.S. participation in international organizations and treaties, even for humanitarian reasons is eroding national sovereignty.\"3 This phobia regarding international organizations is intensified when it appears to some that these agencies are deviating from their narrowly focused traditional missions.\" For diehard adherents of this perspective, coeval international organizations are heedlessly \"shifting rapidly towards an activist, internationalist agenda\" that undermines U.S. sovereignty in favor of a hostile Third World majority.405 Under this view traditional conceptions of sovereignty, and constitutional governance are purportedly \"being subjugated to self-anointed 'intellectually progressive' and vague concepts of international responsibilities and control.\"\"46 Proponents of the resolution were quick to reject the contentions that the resolution was a tool for illegitimate and unwarranted intervention. They argued that rather than infringe \"on sovereignty or authority of countries,\" the resolution merely reflected the \"collective will of the Security Council.-407 Further, it was argued that resolution was fully within the competence and jurisdiction of the Council. The resolution focused \"appropriately on the area where the Security Council has the primary responsibility and the most at stake,\" to wit, the impact of AIDS on peacekeeping\" \" Rather than usurping powers, the resolution was simply a legitimate extension of Security Council \"interest into a field that had previously not been considered.\"49 Proponents argued the resolution was not all that different from other council resolutions. Like other Council resolutions, this one too was simply designed \"to galvanize international action to meet common threats\" -the quintessence of one of the primary purposes for which the UN was founded.410 As further evidence of their sensitivity towards the institution of sovereignty, proponents pointed to the limited nature of the resolution and its narrow focus on peacekeeping. 403.

See id.[Vol. 13:2 THE OLDE ORDER CRUMBLETH The resolution also raises, albeit obliquely, the question and the prospect of humanitarian intervention on behalf of AIDS victims. Humanitarian intervention has been defined as proportionate transboundary help, including forcible help, provided by governments to persons in another state who are being denied fundamental human rights and who themselves would be rationally inclined to rebel against their oppressive government.4' As some commentators have argued, humanitarian intervention is legitimate and even necessary in cases involving \"genocide, famine, etc. [sic].\" 412 It is no surprise then that for some, the resolution (or perhaps its penumbras) evoke the specter of forcible UN humanitarian intervention on behalf of AIDS victims. The doctrine of humanitarian intervention remains very controversial. Opponents of the doctrine worry that due to many \"inherent difficulties and costs,\" there is \"little consistency in the practice of intervention\" and weak states are far more likely to be victims of intervention than powerful states.\"' Others worry humanitarian intervention could become a ruse for \"gratuitous interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.\"'' The practice has very strong advocates, including Mr. Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary General. In remarks that generated some controversy, Mr. Annan advocated the use armed forces in humanitarian interventions to stop mass murder and egregious violations of human rights-a position that has generated significant controversy among UN members.\" Mr. Annan maintains that when crimes against humanity occur and \"peaceful attempts to halt them have been exhausted, the Security Council has a moral duty to act on behalf of the international community.'416 As the Secretary-General argues, the fact that the international community cannot protect people everywhere is \"no reason for doing nothing when we can.417 Unlike intervention for self- detennination, humanitarian intervention goes above the principle of sovereignty as it acknowledges certain basic human rights, including the right to life, which \"transcends the limits of the state.\"4' 411. For a good discussion of the concept of humanitarian intervention and the acceptability of the use of force to achieve it, see, e.g., FERNANDO R. TESON, HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION: AN INQUIRY INTO LAW AND MORALITY (1988). Teson argues that from an \"ethical standpoint\" governments are mere agents of the people, \"their international rights derive from the rights of the individuals who inhabit and constitute the state.\" Id.

Since humanitarian intervention is acknowledged as a very clear exception to the principle of sovereignty,419 the resolution may be viewed as laying the foundation for subsequent efforts to engage in potentially intrusive interventions on behalf of AIDS victims. In effect, the notion that AIDS is a genocide-like threat to international security opens up intriguing possibilities with regard to humanitarian intervention by the international community in support of the victims. It is feared that this seemingly benign encroachment into health matters-matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction- could open the door to even more invasive interventions-including perhaps measures under Chapter VII of the Charter. As far-fetched as it sounds, the prospect of forcible intervention by international organizations on behalf of disease sufferers is not entirely without precedent or historical analogy. Ram Dass and Paul Gorman have written about a dramatic episode during the small pox eradication campaign where an international immunization team invaded an Indian household in the night to \"forcibly vaccinate a family against their will.420 These concerns notwithstanding, supporters of the resolution aver that the UN, even with the resolution, could not \"require member states to force involuntary testing of their troops,\" as such a move \"would violate the United Nations' respect for national sovereignty.\" 421 However, it is not clear how the Security Council would deal with a very high HIV-prevalence country whose government staunchly and systematically refuses to cooperate with international agencies on implementing the peacekeeping resolution. Regardless of how these questions are eventually resolved, it is clear that the Security Council resolution on AIDS has significantly reshaped coeval understandings of Article 2(7) of the UN Charter that prohibits the UN from encroaching into \"matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction\" of Member States. III. A PERMANENT SHIFT? A NOTE ON BUSH ADMINISTRATION POLICmS It was feared that the new administration of George W. Bush would rethink U.S. interests in Africa and sharply reverse Clinton's pro-Africa policies. One analyst predicted a Bush presidency would mean a return to the \"blatantly anti-African policies of the Reagan-Bush years, characterized by a general disregard for black people and a perception of Africa as a social welfare case.\"'422 Unlike candidate Gore's policy advisers and likely 419.

When Mr. Bush was asked about his foreign policy regarding Africa during the second presidential debate, he offhandedly remarked: \"There's got to be priorities.\"'425 Notwithstanding these ominous portents, AIDS and other infectious diseases have emerged as a major priority in the global security agenda of the Bush administration -at least pre-September 11 th. Fueled by the leadership of Secretary of State Powell, the U.S. government continued and even expanded Clinton era foreign assistance to combat AIDS.

One of Mr. Gore's chief foreign policy advisers, Leon Fuerth, a progressive internationalist, had identified AIDS, terrorism, and environmental degradation as key threats to U.S. security and as centerpieces of a future Gore foreign policy. See id. With respect to AIDS, Fuerth argued that a coordinated global response was required, warning \"It isn't as if this disease is going to stay put in sub-Saharan Africa.\" Id.

HIV/AIDS Task Force co-chaired by Health and Human Service Secretary (Tommy Thompson) and Colin Powell; it also named Jack Chow to the newly created position of Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Health and Science. In May 2001, the president pledged $200 million for the Global Fund to fight AIDS tuberculosis and malaria.428 In March 2002, on the eve of the Monterey Summit for Development, the U.S. announced a \"compact for development\" that included a pledge for an additional $5 billion in development assistance (mostly grants) over the next three years.429 By June 2001, Secretary Powell was fully engaged in the global war against AIDS, leaving no doubt in the minds of observers that he considered the pandemic a threat to U.S. interests. Powell urged the UN to develop \"comprehensive and coordinated efforts\" to combat AIDS because posed a grave danger to international security. Sounding like very much like Holbrooke, Powell remarked: AIDS is not just a humanitarian or health issue. It not only kills. It also destroys communities. It decimates countries. It destabilizes regions. It can consume continents. No war on the face of the earth is more destructive than the AIDS pandemic.430 Until September 11th and the necessary shift in U.S. overseas priorities, it appeared as if the realignment of national interests began in the Clinton administration was going to continue. As the Bush administration turned its attention to the global war on terror, attention to the AIDS pandemic fell off 428.

Nonetheless, even as the Bush administration was aggressively emulating the Clinton-Gore lead on this issue, the administration was being tugged to the right in certain areas. The administration was the only abstaining party when the fifty-three member UN Human Rights Commission voted on a resolution designed to improve access to AIDS drugs. See United States Abstains from Vote on AIDS Drugs Resolution, available at http://usinfo.state.gov/ topical/global/hiv/01042302.htm (last visited June 19, 2002) (However, the Commission itself lost a lot of credibility when it took the step of ousting the United States, even as human rights violators such as the Sudan were well ensconced). Additionally, some activists were concerned by what they perceived as a seemingly disproportionate focus on prevention, including abstinence, as opposed to treatment by key Bush administration officials. See id. Critiquing what he believed to be a cosmetic response to the gravest health threat in nearly a millennia, Tony Burdon, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam noted the world's richest nations had scrounged up \"enough money for some prevention, but not a penny to treat the sick.\" Id. Additionally, the Bush administration mounted a fierce but unsuccessful campaign to defeat the treatment equity proposals by the developing countries at the Doha Ministerial Summit of the WTO in Nov. 2001. 430.

Even as the war on the global terror network remains on the front burner, Bush administration officials continue to view the fight against AIDS as an important U.S. national interest. Speaking in the post September 11 period, Paula Dobriansky, Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs stated that AIDS in Africa remains one of the administration's \"highest priorities.''131 During the 2003 State of the Union speech, Bush gave credence to this view when he stated that he would ask Congress for $15 billion over the next five years, including nearly $10 billion in new money to fight AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean.432 Bush's endorsement of a vigorous campaign to reduce the threat of AIDS \"surprised many433 of his supporters and detractors alike. In a University of Scranton lecture discussing the threat of AIDS in Africa, Leon Fuerth remarked \"Something has happened to the thinking of President Bush along the way... It may be the realization that chaos in other countries\" increases the likelihood that these countries may become \"bases for the operations of terror.434 Even as some skeptics questioned the President's commitment on the global AIDS issue, this writer saw Bush's pledge as further evidence of the continuing rethinking of 'security' and other concepts in international affairs-a process largely precipitated and accelerated by the Clinton-Gore team, including key advisers such as Richard Holbrooke and Leon Fuerth. IV. CONCLUSION The concepts of national interest and sovereignty are not cast in stone, nor are they entombed in a hermetically sealed conceptual casket. In the course of the global response to AIDS, the international community questioned and re-assessed traditional understandings of national interest, security, and sovereignty, precipitating a new consensus about the synergies between national interest and international interest.

In a scathing editorial for the New York Times, Princeton University economist Paul Krugman questioned Bush's program to fight AIDS in Africa, citing it as further evidence of the President's \"mendacity,\" \"record of broken promises,\" \"discredited the administration's foreign policy\" and visited great harm on the reputation of the United States \"in the eyes of much of the world.\" Paul Krugman, Threats, Promises and Lies Straining Bush's Credibility, THE SCRANTON TIMES, Feb. 26,2003, at4.2003] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REV. transborder security threat, interstate cooperation on health issues is weakening traditional conceptual boundaries, placing into question the conventional meanings of national interest, sovereignty, and non-intervention. Efforts to understand these transformations in the international ecosystem are aided by flexible neoliberal institutionalist perspectives instead of the realists' static conceptions of interest and sovereignty. The U.S. administration of Bill Clinton took a leadership role in rethinking and redefining U.S. national interests regarding international health, as well as in building global support for a campaign against AIDS as a security threat. In fact, an examination of the global response to AIDS as a security threat is also a case study about the role of U.S. as a force for good. It is apparent that in a uni-polar world dominated by an undisputed hegemon, with disproportionate resources, U.S. leaders have tremendous impact on the quality of world order.435 In that regard, the Clinton Administration strongly demonstrated the tremendous ability of the U.S. to be a force for good in the battle against AIDS. The intensified global focus on HIV/AIDS as a security threat was spurred, in part, by a decisive rethinking of U.S. national interests with regard to international health and a more comprehensive view of nexus between national and international security, broadly conceived. Conceptions of national interest and security (traditional realist variables) were transformed by new understanding about the catastrophic potential of the AIDS, new knowledge about the processes of bio-globalization and visionary reflectivity regarding these new trends. New thinking about security in the vortex of the pandemic, ushered in a novel consensus about values intrinsic to the long term sustainability and governance of a nascent global society besieged by seemingly implacable microbial foes. With strong U.S. leadership, world leaders recognized AIDS as a major security crisis, and they placed the pandemic at the apex of global security agenda. The nature and quality of coeval sovereignty is not static. As the international community developed targeted interventions designed to multilaterally respond to AIDS as a security issue, the institution of sovereignty underwent substantial transformation. The Security Council's engagement on the matter of AIDS and its relationship to conflict is arguably the clearest harbinger yet of a bold new challenge to the sacrosanct institution of sovereignty. The meeting and the ensuing resolution were key indicators of the changing assessments of national interest, international security, and the nature of sovereignty in the age of globalization. The Security Council's resolution on AIDS as well as the heightened level of cooperative synergies portend a significant-even a radical-transformation of sovereignty. The destructive threat of global pestilence effectively re-ordered state's valuations 435. See Spectar, supra note 158, at 1036 (suggesting that \"like Atlas or the Archimedean lever,\" the U.S. can, and should, lead the world in resolving or managing the thorny global challenges of the twenty-first century).[Vol. 13:2 THE OLDE ORDER CRUMBLETH of sovereignty and curtailed states' resort to the use of sovereignty as a shield. By challenging the primacy of the state on \"local\" issues such as health, the global response to AIDS is a challenge to the institution of sovereignty. In effect, the emerging consensus that AIDS is a transborder security requiring sustained concerted responses laid the groundwork for more intensified interstate cooperation on health issues, and ipso facto, a loosening of the bonds of sovereignty. The transformation of the institution of sovereignty and its doppelganger, the principle of non-intervention, is further evidence of the limits of statecentrism and national-interest-based approaches to global problems. The principle of non-intervention is equally being transformed by increasingly activist international institutions in the war against AIDS. The coordinated global response, especially the Security Council resolution, arguably opens the door for the 'intrusion' of the UN into even more spheres hitherto considered \"matters essentially within domestic jurisdiction.\" This revivified internationalism has raised the dander of UN detractors and others suspicious of a brave new interventionist world order, marked by the erosion of national sovereignty. Despite its seemingly narrow focus, the overall thrust of the resolution and its long term implications portend an expansion of the scope and power of international institutions at the expense of state power. The global response to AIDS might in a sense be a precursor to bolder humanitarian interventions on behalf of victims of the four horsemen. The heightened international coordination and cooperation on the AIDS problem is best explained by neoliberal institutionalist approaches, as opposed to conventional realism. Liberal institutionalists take a more flexible approach to concepts such as sovereignty and view them to be capable of modification in the interactive processes of interstate discourse and intercourse. The liberal institutionalist approach accounts for an evolutionary notion sovereignty and provides a viable framework for thinking about sovereignty and justice. To cope with the emerging threats of the twenty-first century, it will be increasingly necessary to reject the realists' prescriptions and to embrace a dynamic institutionalist perspective. The inextricable linkage between global and human security further blurs the distinction between so called international and domestic issues and this is sure to spark further interest in the so called 'intermestic realm.' To the degree that the response to the AIDS pandemic fueled a new consensus about significance of 'intermestic' thinking regarding traditional concepts such as national interest, security, and sovereignty, the pandemic is altering the nature of diplomatic discourse and practice. Given the link between health and security, it would seem that the much-vaunted border between high and low politics is not so impervious after all. International lawyers and political scientists will need to develop new interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary approaches that capture the multidimensional dynamics of this new realm. By blurring the distinction between matters of local versus global concern, the response to the AIDS pandemic is fueling a new reflective2003] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REV. consensus on core conceptions such as national interest, security and sovereignty. Evidence of the new international consensus is evident in the intensified level of concerted action to come to the rescue of Africa -the vortex of the pandemic. Out of this has come a clear sense of the interconnectedness of the human condition, particularly as technological and socio-economic links demonstrate the relative smallness of the planet. This intensified and concerted response by a broad swath of states was an exemplar of international cooperation at the dawn of a new era. If the promise and momentum created by UN Security Council resolution is sustained, humankind may be at the threshold of a new era of international cooperation. In its response to AIDS as a security issue, the international community took the first important baby step, transcending the shackles of statecentrism and venturing forth in the development of a viable normative framework for managing galloping globalization. Recognizing the limits of the statecentric system, world leaders opted for intensified cooperative and coordinated activity in the management of a common threat. Looking ahead, sovereignty will continue to be eroded by increasingly prohibitive forms of intervention into conventionally internal matters. Significant derogations from sovereignty may be necessary and appropriate if the international community is going to successfully manage globalization. States will increasingly modify their conceptions of national interest to embrace a broader vision of 'world interest' and the concept of international security will continue to undergo sustained revision and transformation; likewise, the traditional doctrine of non-intervention will be increasingly limited in scope.436 436. The need for greater cooperation and coordination is made even more urgent today as the new specter of the new SARS epidemic stealthily stalks the planet. See HK Braces as Global Toll Mounts, at http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTHI04/06/sars.wrap/index.htn- (last visited Apr. 7, 2003). SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome is a new communicable disease that reportedly originated from China's Guangdong province but that has spread rapidly to Hong Kong, Canada, and Singapore, and is also threatening the United States and other areas. Id. In just a few months, SARS has already infected about 2600 persons and killed ninety-five people around the globe. Id. The epidemic is also threatening the global economic recovery. See Geoff Hiscoc, Virus Raises Asian Recession Fear, at http://www.cnn.com/2003/BUSINESS/ asia/ 04/01/asia.sarsimpact.biz/index.html (last visited Apr. 8, 2003) (noting economists' fears that SARS is \"potentially the most serious event facing the region since the 1997-98 financial crisis\"). On a positive note, it appears as if the international community learned a valuable lesson from its initially slow response to the AIDS pandemic. In the face of impending disruptions of global society and commerce by SARS, the international community is mobilizing a quicker response and chastising China's lackadaisical reaction to the epidemic and her failure to quickly warn her neighbors. The lesson is becoming clearer: a viral outbreak in one country is not an internal matter, a local secret, to be shrouded by the outmoded cloak of national sovereignty, and to be screened from external problem solver and/or decision makers by the myopic prism of national interest. In the age of globalization, marauding microbes threaten the peace, progress, and well-being of global society just as much as two-bit tyrants or terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. The SARS epidemic further highlights the need to continue to rethink the security, sovereignty, intervention, and national interests in the new age of galloping globalization and jet "}
