Urban India produces 62 million metric tonnes (MMT) of municipal solid waste every year, 70 per cent of which is collected and only 25 per cent of this collected waste is processed. Figures for recycling are abysmal; for instance, out of 25,940 tonnes of plastic waste generated per day, only 15,564 tonnes gets processed; similarly 95 per cent of e-waste is managed by the informal sector, which is a huge concern. The need of the hour is to shift the focus towards source segregation, recycle and reuse. This will further strengthen and foster 'Circular Economy' by creating and optimizing resource 'loops' along value chains and will ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns into waste management systems. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has been working on policy and implementation with regard to waste management at the national and global levels. The Anil Agarwal Environment Training Institute (AAETI), a CSE initiative, recognizes the need to adopt resource efficient waste management regimes, and offers an advanced five-day training programme on 'Circular Economy & Resource Efficiency for Sustainable Waste Management'. The objective of the programme is to provide a better understanding of the key aspects of management of solid, plastic, biomedical, construction and demolition (C&D) and e-waste; feasibility of technologies involved in their treatment; regulatory frameworks; best practices and stakeholders involved. COURSE HIGHLIGHTS Status of waste management in India Major provisions of the Waste Management Rules, 2016 and its amendments Utilization of the concept of circularity and resource efficiency in different waste streams Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Developing decentralised waste management frameworks Using information, education and communication for behaviour change National and international best practices Site visits WHO CAN APPLY Waste management practitioners, officials from central and state urban departments and municipalities, urban and town planners, village panchayat officials and members, academicians, students, and NGO representatives.CIRCULAR ECONOMY & RESOURCE EFFICIENCY for Sustainable Waste ManagementCERTIFICATE COURSE ON Rashmi Shrivastav, Feb 29 ad.indd 2 11/02/20 2:43 PM DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 3 CALL IT the revenge of the bug. The new coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, has done to the Chinese economy what US President Donald Trump could not do. It has wreaked havoc in the world's second largest economy; grinding it to a halt; shutting down its cities; and, isolating its people. Today, we are seeing perhaps the largest effort ever to contain the spread of this infection\u2014Chinese President Xi Jinping called it a people's war on the virus. But the worrying question is this: with over 600 deaths and over 31,000 people infected in just about a month, how long will it last? The virus stays dormant for over two weeks\u2014that is even if people are infected, the symptoms do not show. The good news is that the mortality rate is low; but on the other hand, the fear of contagion is high as the virus moves through the air from people to people. So, the answer is to ensure that anyone possibly exposed is isolated and quarantined. But what does this mean for an inter-connected world, which has broken every record in terms of trans- boundary movement of people and trade? Consider this. In 2003, when the world witnessed the first such global health crisis, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( sars), China accounted for only 4 per cent of the world's gdp. Today it is 16 per cent. Business begins and ends in China. It is the world's ultimate supply chain. So, this health crisis will disrupt business all across the world. Also, now, the movement of people is massive and this is why the movement of the virus is also so fast. There is no doubt that governments are stepping in; closing doors. But it shows our common vulnerability; how quickly a common cold can become a global contagion. There is also more that we must discuss\u2014more seriously than when we were confronted with sars in 2003, and then with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( mers) in 2012. The fact is that in these cases, including the 2019-nCoV, the virus found in bats has jumped from animals to humans. In the case of sars, the World Health Organization ( who) found that the civet cat, raccoon dog and badger were the most likely intermediate hosts. In the case of mers , the camel was the interme - diate host. The route of 2019-nCoV is not yet clear\u2014the local market, which is seen to be the source of the outbreak, does not sell bats, it is said. But even as scientists work out the details, the fact is that we are beginning to see more zoonotic diseas - es\u2014from swine flu to avian influenza. These are diseases that are getting trans - ferred from animals to humans, triggering a pandemic. The fact is that so much of this virus transference is happening because of our dystopian relationship with the natural world. On the one hand, we are pushing every kind of chemical and toxin into our food. This is making food a source of disease, not just nutrition. Antibiotics are being shoved into animals and even crops\u2014not for disease control but to make them grow more; put on weight, so that business profits. As a result, resistance to drugs needed for human survival is on the rise. On the other, we are growing our food in ways that favour disease growth\u2014industrial farms, which are vertically integrated, are fast becom - ing the source of contagion. Remember the origin of swine flu from industrial hog factories in Mexico that contaminated water! This breaking of the boundaries between animal and human habitats will lead to more such outbreaks. And this, in a world that is even more inter-connected and globalised, will make the infection wildly contagious. There is also the question of the manner in which trade works in the world. The fact is global vulnerability will increase\u2014from disease to climate change. In the past three decades, the world has invested in building a monolith trade system, which has no local or regional control. The risk management systems of the poor should teach us that diversification is the key to survival. The farmers of our world always minimised risk through a system of crop and livestock management. They grew a variety of crops\u2014scientists have counted over 50 crops growing in single homesteads. They reduced dependence on the factors that they could not control, but worked on ways to build more resilient local economies. Now, I know that we cannot turn back the clock of globalisation; we cannot wish away this monster world trade system. It is profitable and it is aspirational\u2014everybody wants to be integrated to the world supply chain. But surely, given the almost certain shocks that await us in our world, it is time we re-thought the very idea of globalisation. Let's start by working on localisation first.

The chance discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 and its subsequent development by Howard Walter Florey introduced a new era of medicine. Both Fleming and Florey were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1945. In his acceptance speech, Fleming raised alarm on the overuse of antibiotics: \"Time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant men may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug, make them resistant. \" The antibiotic apocalypse described in the article corroborates Fleming's apprehensions. Indeed, now we are moving backwards to the world of our grandparents where bacterial infections were often lethal because no specific treatments were available. The natural process of evolution of resistant strains has been acceler - ated by the selective pressure exerted by the widespread,indiscriminate and irrational use of antimicrobial drugs. Because of the legendary resilience of microbes, the least that humans can do is to keep them at bay. In the continuing epic struggle with microbes we are in critical need for novel strategies to boost the antimicrobial arsenal. In any event, we should not forget what the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould said: \"We live in the age of bacteria...as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, until the world ends. \" JAYDEV JANA KOLKATAFood supplements a concern This is in reference to the cover story \"Communicating diseases\" (16-31 December, 2019). Consumer awareness is very low not only in case of fast foods but also in case of diet supplements which is a soaring industry fast gaining popularity among Indians, particularly among youth. India is one of the world's youngest nations and the craze for body building is quite significant among school- and college-goers. Diet supplements like whey protein, fat cutters, glutamine and protein isolates make good sales and youngsters are fanatical about taking them, even skipping their normal meals. This is a great concern.

At a time when the country is struggling to find a solution to dispose of the faecal sludge of millions of Indians who have septic tanks, your article on the treasure in excreta and some success stories in the pilot studies are most heartening.

In most of the Himalayas, including the Shivalik Range, a lot of the so-called agricultural land would be better off under trees. In fact, most of this agricultural land was anyway earlier forestland but gradually became agricultural due to the insidious and relentless encroachments\u2014something no politician or political party is willing to tackle. This illegal \"transfer\" of forestland continues unabated. It is very difficult to grasp this encroachment because it is extremely gradual and incremental, and is done on a very widespread scale in forests that have no boundaries and whose areas were measured a 100 years ago with primitive instruments. Governments are not even willing to demarcate forest boundaries using Global Positioning System and making proper, verifiable Geographic Information System (GIS) maps. Compulsory afforestation done even on twice the area diverted in degraded forests is generally untraceable after five to six years because there is neither any GIS map nor record of survival with the forest departments. After a decade or so, compulsory afforestation can be done again on the same patch, like it happens in most forest department afforestation schemes. In this way we can keep going around in circles and patting ourselves on the back with the unverifiable \"State of Forest\" reports, even as our forests continue to thin out and disappear.

The machines cut straw, chop them and even turn them into bundles. The farmers travel across Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab, collect straw and sell them to dairy farms and gaushala s (cow sheds) as fodder for cows of native breeds.WHAT'S INSIDE VIKAS CHOUDHARY 1,000 WORDS 11-13Digest.indd 11 10/02/20 11:42 AMTrees that bind families INDIA HAS a culture of carrying out plantation drives and they attract huge participation. The survival rate of these plants, however, remains low as most are left uncared for. This always bothered Kalyan Singh Rawat, who is now 66 years old and lives in Dehradun, Uttrakhand. So in 1994, this biology teacher at the government intercollege in Gwaldam, Chamoli district, started the Maiti Andolan. Maiti in local language means the home of a bride's mother. Rawat's idea was simple: each bride would gift a sapling to her mother before leaving for her in-laws' house. In return, the newly-wed would get sapling of a fruit-bearing tree. Over the years, more than 500,000 plants have been sowed under the initiative and each one has been raised with love and care because of the emotional connect. This has improved water and fodder availaibility in the region. \"We also carry out plantation drives. In one such drive, we transformed a 10-hectare barren land into a small forest in Chamoli and named it after Gaura Devi to pay homage to the Chipko movement, \" he says, adding that the movement brought him close to nature. The idea of Maiti came to him in 1982 when his wife, Manju Rawat, planted two papaya trees in the backyard just days after their wedding. The couple invested time and effort in the trees and were overwhelmed when they bore fruit. Drawing from the experience, Rawat undertook similar initiatives in nearby communities, but those were unsuccessful. In 1987, Uttarkashi witnessed a severe drought. To ensure that the parched trees were taken care of, a tree coronoation ceremony was organised. A village-level tree committee was also established and the panchayat head was made its chief. That was also the time when Rawat had started sensitising students about the Maiti initiative. Soon, at a wedding, a bride gifted her mother a sapling. \"The gesture affected all at the wedding and the practice became the norm in Uttarakhand. Now, most wedding cards mention Maiti as a distinct ceremony, \" Rawat says. The practice has also become popular in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. In fact, it has now gained international recognition. Some cities in Indonesia have made it mandatory for couples to plant saplings before getting their marriage registered. The initiative is successful in Nepal as well. Flora MacDonald, Canada's foreign minister in the late1970s, met Rawat in 1999 and promised him that she would popularise the initiative in her country. This biology teacher has been awarded Padma Shri this year and says the initiative can go a long way in increasing local climate resilience.An Uttarkhand teacher gives reasons to take care of plants after plantation drives VARSHA SINGH Digest /IN FRONT 11-13Digest.indd 12 14/02/20 10:27 AMOVER 350 Amazon employees from across the globe have alleged that the US tech multinational is funding climate deniers for oil and gas trade. The news comes months after Amazon chief Jeff Bezos publicly announced that his company is committed to become carbon-neutral by 2040. The employees, under the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice banner, spoke out after Amazon changed its external communications policy that threatens to fire employees for speaking out about climate change without proper authorisation. \"They are telling Jeff Bezos to end his hypocrisy: You cannot call your corporation a 'leader' on climate change while partnering with ExxonMobil and BP to extract more fossil fuels,\" tweeted US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. This trend of tech multinationals either downplaying or, worse, faking their climate commitments is becoming common. In November 2019, over 2,300 Google employees, under Google Workers for Action on Climate, issued a list of efforts they want the company to undertake to fight climate change. The list includes, zero emissions by 2030, zero contracts with fossil fuel firms, zero funding for climate-denying or -delaying think tanks, lobbyists and politicians, and zero collaboration with entities enabling the incarceration, surveillance, displacement, or oppression of refugees or frontline communities. Similarly, employees of Microsoft openly criticised the company's \"complicity in the climate crisis\" last September when it entered a partnership with oilfield services company Chevron and Schlumberger. Tech giants clandestinely join hands with climate deniersINDIA MAY soon get its first cheetah from Namibia after the Supreme Court gave the green signal. The apex court had earlier stayed such relocations stating that there was no scientific study to show that reintroduction of cheetahs and lions in Madhya Pradesh's Kuno- Palpur Wildlife Sanctuary would be successful. Cheetahs became extinct in India when the ruler of an erstwhile princely state in Koriya, Chhattisgarh, gunned down the last three Asiatic cheetahs in 1947. However, some did spot a female cheetah in 1951. CUTTLEFISH EAT fewer crabs during the day if they know they will get shrimps, their favourite food, in the evening. Their sophisticated brain allows them to optimise their foraging activity not only to guarantee they eat enough but also to ensure they eat more of the food they prefer. A University of Cambridge report shows they quickly shift from one eating strategy to another depending upon their experience. This discovery could provide valuable insight into the evolutionary origins of such complex cognitive ability.BITS Court halts mining in Borneo's pristine land AFTER A two-year legal battle, Indonesia's Supreme Court has revoked the permit to mine coal in the mountainous forests of Central Hulu Sungai regency in Borneo's South Kalimantan province. The region, with rich-biodiversity, is home to several endangered species, including critically endangered Bornean orangutan, and has so far remained untouched by coal mines and palm oil plantations. That's the reason, in 2017 when the Indonesian government granted PT Mantimin Coal Mining (MCM) a permit to operate there, it caused an uproar among residents and environmental groups and surprised local government officials who have supported local people in their opposition to mining and plantation projects. With assistance from Walhi, Indonesia's largest environmental protection group, the residents sued MCM and the ministry of energy and mineral resources. Their line of defence was centred around the loophole related to granting of the permit, which requires the approval of local people. Activists had also delivered over a thousand handwritten letters to Indonesian President Joko Widodo calling for justice and to save the verdant mountain range.An Amazon employee speaks at a rally outside the company's shareholders meeting in May 2019PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY: AMAZON EMPLOYEES FOR CLIMATE JUSTICE SNAPSHOTS /Digest DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 13 11-13Digest.indd 13 10/02/20 2:30 PMANALYSIS /BUDGET 2020 EXPERT'S GUIDE TO RURAL DISTRESS This year's Budget has all the ingredients to deepen India's farm crisis JITENDRA NEW DELHI 14 DOWN TO EARTH 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 14-21Budget.indd 14 12/02/20 4:53 PMTHESE ARE times. Rural unem - ployment is at a 45-year high while the con - sumption expenditure of rural families has fallen by 9 per cent between 2011-12 and 2017-18, as per a report by the National Sample Survey Office ( nsso) that the government never released but got leaked to the media in November 2019. Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, the income of farmers grew by just 0.44 per cent a year, and has not risen since then. One way to counter a flailing economy is cash infusion. So, when Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sithara - man presented the Budget for financial year 2020-21, economists were expecting a substantial fiscal stimulus to key government initiatives, such as the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi ( pm-kisan is a direct cash transfer scheme under which farmers receive income support of R 6,000 a year) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ( mgnregs ). In a media interac - tion in October 2019, Nobel laureate Abhijit Baner - jee also suggested increase in allocation to mgnregs to reboot the economy by boosting demand and in - creasing consumption in rural areas. But this did not happen. Instead, the announcements are likely to aggra - vate rural distress, facilitate privatisation of the farm sector and trigger population movement from villages to cities because allocations to many cru - cial schemes have either gone down, remained static or risen marginally (see 'Who gains?'). Budget allocation for pm-kisan has been kept the same at R75,000 crore, while the budget for mgnregs has gone down by R10,000 crore\u2014from R71,002 crore (re - vised estimates) for 2019-20 to R61,500 crore in 2020-21. There are more such inexplicable announcements. The gov - ernment has massively reduced the food subsidy bill\u2014from R 1.84 lakh crore to R 1.15 lakh crore. This is bound to impact the purchasing capacity of the Food Corporation of India ( fci), the nodal agency that procures wheat and rice to be supplied under the public distri - bution system, and indirectly impact farmers whose grains will not be bought. Moreover, fci, whose share in the food subsidy bill last year was R 1.51 lakh crore, spent just R75,000 crore.

Similarly, the subsidy on fertilisers has been re - duced by R9,534 crore\u2014 R83,434 crore to R73,900 crore. This has been done ostensibly to discourage the use of chemical fertilisers and promote organic ones. But there is no corresponding rise in subsidy of organic fertilisers. \"It's plain ignorance if the government thinks organic farming does not re - quire fertiliser,\" says Devinder Sharma, a Chandi - garh-based agriculture and trade policy analyst. The government has allocated a paltry R12.5 crore to promote the use of organic and biological sources of nutrients. \"Study shows that stopping the use of chemical-based fertilisers to shift to zero-budget natural farming can reduce yield by 25 per cent to 50 per cent, which may put the country's food secu - rity at risk,\" says Ashok Gulati, Infosys chair profes - sor at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations ( icrier ), a Delhi- based think tank. \"So the government needs to be cautious while moving towards zero budget or organic farming,\" he adds. The minimum support price regime has also taken a hit. The government has reduced alloca - tions to Market Intervention Scheme and Price Support designated Union government agencies, such as the National Agricultural Coop - erative Marketing Federation of India ( nafed ), procure crops under price support schemes and work to provide adequate remuneration to farmers for their produce. The budget for pm-aasha has been reduced to a third\u2014from R 1,500 crore in 2019-20 to R 500 crore. What exactly is the government trying to do? GRAND DESIGN \"It seems the government wants to aggravate rural distress, if not engineer new ones. It wants to reduce the number of people working in the farm sector and trigger a population migration towards cities. That is its idea of development and urbanisation,\" says Sharma.

The government seems to be working to that end. In its two terms, the National Democratic Alli - ance government has brought in three \"Model\" Acts that show its intent to bring in private play - ers in the agrarian economy\u2014the Model Agricul - tural Land Leasing Act, 2016; the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017; and the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Con - tract Farming and Services (Promotion and Fa - cilitation) Act, 2018. The government wants all states to adopt these Acts but so far only three\u2014Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra\u2014have complied, and that too in part. These Acts not just formalise and facilitate involvement of big companies in agriculture but tilt the playing field in their favour. For instance, the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016, provides security to the landowner to lease out land to anyone. Agricultural laws in the country work on the presumption that the tiller is the owner of the land. For this reason, big landown - ers in villages have traditionally feared signing contracts with farmers who work on their lands. Most such arrangements work on trust. This Act will not only make landowners secure about their right over the land, but also encourage companies to lease large tracts and undertake initiatives for captive farming. The second, Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, ends the monopoly of state-level Agri - cultural Produce Marketing Committees in orga- nising and controlling agriculture markets or mandi s. At such markets, buyers pay a mandi tax, and legally no trade can happen between farmers and buyers outside such markets as that will be a tax theft. Traders have always demanded that they be allowed to buy produce anywhere as this would save them mandi tax and allow them to bargain. But farmers stand to lose from this. The third, Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Pro - motion and Facilitation) Act, 2018, formalises contract farming.

This is aggravated by the urban heat island effect (UHIE), which is a result of diminishing green spaces, waste heat from air-conditioners (AC), polluted air, heat absorbing building materials, constricted ventilation due to dense urban fabric, among others. Bureau of Energy Efficiency predicts that India's built-up area will increase by five times by 2030, dominated by residential use. Therefore, housing sector plays an instrumental role in shaping India's future built stock to be resilient to the effects of climate change such as heat stress in urban areas, soaring energy budget due to rising demand for cooling and flooding due to extreme rainfall among others. As India is building about 12 million units in urban areas as part of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, there is a strong need to mainstream climate-appropriate development practices. Anil Agarwal Environment Training Institute (AAETI) offers this course to familiarize participants with the ambit of current government policies and schemes, inclusive spatial planning, innovative and cost-effective environmental services, and the role building geometry and material choice plays in planning and designing climate appropriate housing. SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS PROGRAMME WILL BE: Affordable housing in India, demand and supply footprints Housing environment, urban planning and climate vulnerability issues: Health risk related to rising outdoor and indoor temperatures Implication to energy consumption, mobility costs and other socio-economic disadvantages Housing and urban planning: Location attractiveness index and accessibility to socio-economic infrastructure Housing and mobility: land use and transport integration and pro-poor mobility Urban design impacts health and living costs: Heat island effect and its interface with urban landscape, Environmental Impact assessment for housing projects Conservation practices and their interface with design: rainwater harvesting, decentralised wastewater treatment, solar rooftop etc. Enabling thermal comfort for all via building geometry, layout and materials Introduction to India Cooling Action Plan 2019 and the focus on thermal comfort Eco Niwas Samhita 2018 for energy conservation in residential buildings Walling materials and their properties; introduction to 24 alternative materials and construction technologies for housing Building energy simulation exercise for indoor thermal comfort Daylighting and its components AAETI is an ECBC compliant sustainable, state of the art campus.

If there is a natural calamity and the crop is destroyed, farmers would still be obligated to honour the contract and supply crops. If the market rate of the crop goes up, the farmer would still be contract-bound to sell it at the agreed rate. Again, they are unlikely to benefit from this Act. 16-POINT AGENDA In her budget speech, Sitharaman announced a 16-point action plan to counter rural distress. These also re-emphasised the government's intention to fa - cilitate private players at the cost of farmers. The government plans to set up and run ware - houses and cold storages on public-private partner - ship ( ppp) model at the block level. So far, all such government facilities were solely owned by fci and the Central Warehouising Corporation. There are many problems with the proposed ppp model. One, private owners will prefer using these facilities to store their own produce. Two, there might be forced land acquisition for setting up the facilities. To improve connectivity for transporting produce, the government has proposed train (Krishi Rail) and flight (Krishi Udaan) facilities. These too will aid big companies more. \"Small and marginal farmers, even large farmers, will not be able to use these facilities. Companies that deal in huge volumes will use them,\" says Ramandeep Singh Mann, a farmer activist based in Delhi. Fisheries is another sector in which the policies announced encourage non-fishers to enter the field. This is most evident from the minuscule R19 crore granted for asset creation (such as cold storages) which could be used by traditional fishers. \"The government has not announced any scheme to help the traditional captive fish farming. This move to shift the traditional occupation away from fishers, and 'liberalising' farm markets is not in the inter - est of fishing communities, both inland and ma - rine,\" says T Peter, general secretary, National Fishworkers' Forum, a trade union.

Under the scheme 30 per cent of the amount is given by the Centre, 30 per cent by the state and 40 per cent by the farmer, of which 30 per cent can be sourced through bank loan. \"This will further in - crease extraction of groundwater,\" says Ghatak. \"Farmers would show interest in producing elec - tricity only if the government gives them better and timely payment for the electricity they supply to the grid,\" says Siraj Hussain, former Union ag - riculture secretary. Even the allocation for rainfed area development and climate change has been reduced from R250 crore to R202 crore. Under this, farmers get financial and other kinds of support, such as cheaper seeds, to practice integrated farming system like inter-crop - ping and rotational cropping. These methods enhance farm returns and mitigate the impacts of drought, flood and other extreme weather events. With climate change, extreme weather events will only rise. Though the government has increased the allocation to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yoja - na\u2014a scheme launched in 2016 to secure farmers against natural calamities and crop loss\u2014from R14,000 crore in 2019-20 to R 15,695 crore for 2020-21, it remains to be seen whether the rise will be enough. In 2018-19, the government accepted claims worth R19,000 crore, shows agriculture ministry data, and in the kharif season of 2019-20, the government has received R18,000 crore of insurance claims, as per media reports. The Centre has also decreased the funds for adap - tation and climate action. The National Adaptation Fund gets R80 crore while the figure in 2019-20 was R100 crore. \"Expenditure on agriculture, livelihood and rural development should have been oriented to - wards mitigating risks, which include climate change. But this has not happened,\" says Kapil Subramanian, climate policy expert at Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Science and Environment. Budget 2020 seems to have all the ingredients that will force farmers to quit agriculture in droves. Is this how the government plans to counter rural distress and double farmers' income by 2022?

It has a manufacturing presence in Newai, a tehsil in Tonk District of Rajasthan. As part of its community development initiatives, Dabur has been rolling out programmes aimed at Environment Sustainability across the country, which includes successfully introducing cultivation of Shankpushpi herb in Barmer. Following a detailed need analysis with the community, Dabur decided to extend its community development initiative in the state and venture into Water Management and Water Conservation to help farmers in the region gain access to water all through the year. During the year 2016-17, Dabur rolled out its maiden project on water conservation in Rajasthan. The intent was to improve the sustainable livelihood of the poorest and excluded communities in the area by strengthening their access to water and technology as well as management capacities. Through this project, , Dabur sought to protect water resources in water-stressed areas, and also aim for significant water-balancing through cost-effective, eco-friendly, community-based technologies like Water Harvesting, Water Conservation, Recharging of Tube Wells and Plantation. Three years later, it's heartening to see that this project has helped increase the water table in Newai region while ensuring round the year availability of water for farmers in 6 villages in the states despite the erratic nature of Monsoon rains. As part of the programme, special sessions were also organised for farmers to generate awareness water conservation and management techniques and adoption of sustainable farm practices for collection and storage of rainwater. The results of this initiative were visible after the Monsoon season every year; with the village water table rising and farmers are gaining access to quality water for irrigation. Around 1200 families have directly benefited from this initiative, earning higher crop yields and better income for their produce. For implementation of the project, the following three activities were carried out in the working area: Nadi Formation, Tanka Construction and Recharging pits (see boxes). A traditional water-harvesting system in Rajasthan, Tanka (small tank) is an underground tank that is built in the main house or in the courtyard. The Tankas are circular holes made in the ground, lined with fine polished lime or cemented, in which rainwater is collected. Under this project, the company decided to construct an improved version of the Tankas with labour contribution from the participating families. In all, 10 Tankas have been constructed in different villages for public use. These Tankas, having a dimension of 12 ft x 12 ft, were constructed at common places so that every SOME OF THE KEY ACHIEVEMENTS WERE: n W ater table has risen significantly (10- 20 meters) n Nearly 3 ,000 cubic metres of rainwater collected and delivered to tube wells every year n St ored water used for irrigation purpose during dry spell n Due t o recharge of tube well and improved availability of water, farmers cultivated wheat, barley and vegetables in addition to mustard n Ar ea under cultivation increased n Soil salinit y decreased due to availability of good quality irrigation water n P roduction increased by 10-20%, resulting in R 10,000-50,000 higher annual earnings for the farmersA CSR initiative of Dabur India LimitedDESERT BLOOM Bringing Water to the Desert 22-23Dabur Advertorial.indd 22 11/02/20 2:45 PMADVERTORIAL ADVERTORIAL Nadis are village ponds that are used for storing water from an adjoining natural catchment during the rainy season. Nadis in Rajasthan serve the purpose of building up water reserves for human beings and their cattle. Besides, being a surface water body, they also act as a watering hole for animals. After detailed discussion with the community, an existing nadi in Palai village was selected for rejuvenation. The nadi was in a neglected state with uneven ground level and very little water storage capacity. Dabur started the rejuvenation work on this nadi by cleaning, repairing, desilting and deepening it with the aim of completing the nadi digging and other related activities around this pond before the onset of Monsoon. Alongside rejuvenating the nadi, its officials also conducted programmes to create awareness among the communities on water conservation and regeneration. The 66 metre (length) x 33 metre (breadth) x 3 metre (depth) nadi now has a capacity to store around 65 lakh litres of water, enough to meet the potable as well as irrigation needs of the villagers for a year. This nadi has been providing water to three adjacent villages for irrigation as well as their drinking purposes. NADI FORMATION household in these villages can have easy access to potable water. Each Tanka has a cemented catchment area for collection of rainwater and one hand pump for taking out water. Each Tanka - with cement plaster, cement concrete and covered with a cemented roof - has the capacity to harvest 32,000 litres of rainwater. While the Tankas were constructed primarily for meeting domestic-water needs, families can use the tanka water for irrigating their plots. Today, 250 families are benefiting from these Tankas. TANKA CONSTRUCTION Over the past decade, scanty rainfall and long periods of dry spell have led to a drop in ground water levels in Tonk district. Understanding the fact that tube well recharge is the best way of harvesting every possible drop of rainwater and sending it directly to the ground water table, Dabur initiated a recharging project as part our larger Water Manage-ment & Conservation initiative in these villages. Under this project, 55 tube wells and wells across the three villages were recharged. For the purpose, cemented containers (with a 3ft x 3ft x 3ft dimension) were constructed and 50-200 ft long pipeline set-up. During rain-fall, the catchment area water flows towards these containers. Once the container was full, the water moved from these contai-ners to the well through the pipe-line, thereby recharging the well. Additionally, a 6ft deep circular ring structure has been cons-tructed near the existing tube wells. The containers are connec-ted to these structures, directing the water flow to recharging these tube wells. RECHARGING PITS 22-23Dabur Advertorial.indd 23 11/02/20 2:45 PMSPECIAL 2009.

As many as 200 workers were trained to generate awareness and to increase demand for healthcare services. These workers went from house to house collecting real-time information on the health of mothers and children on tablets pro - vided to them. Corrective action was taken without delay. The programme helped reduce neonatal mortal - ity up to 32.7 per cent and infant mortality up to 26.5 per cent within three years. Such philanthropic initiatives have a long history in India. But the idea was brought into a legal frame - work in 2014 when csr was introduced as a statutory obligation under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013. Under this, every company with an annual net worth of over `500 crore, turnover of over `1,000 crore, or net profit of over `5 crore, must spend at least 2 per cent of its net profit on csr. Latest data with the Min - istry of Corporate Affairs ( mca) shows expenditure on csr activities has increased from `10,066 crore in 2014-15 to ` 13,624 crore in 2017-18. During this time, the number of public sector undertakings ( psu) and private sector firms also increased from 16,548 to 21,397. These companies divert a major chunk of the csr funds towards human development. A 2019 study by the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs ( iica), a gov - ernment think tank that provides holistic advice on issues related to corporate affairs, shows 55 per cent of the csr funds in the country are spent on human devel - opment and social welfare. As many as 104 companies are involved in activities related to human develop - ment. These include 30 psus and 74 private firms. However, the focus on economic development and envi - ronment sustainable development is relatively poor, the report states. The reason for this, say experts, is the nature of these sectors. \"Traditionally, sectors such as health and education have a clear blueprint and are easy to undertake. Moreover, these activities are easily quantifiable which gives companies ready numbers. But companies have not focused much on environmental activities,\" says Pradip Narayanan, member, csr Laws, Praxis, a Delhi- based non-profit. PHILANTHROPY FROM A DISTANCE In the initial years of the csr Act, mca observed that companies would execute projects far from their area of operations. As per the Act, companies should choose local areas for csr activities, but 73 per cent companies were found to be engaged in areas beyond their area of operations, states the iica report that analysed data from 2014-15 to 2017-18. Maximum expenditure is in industrialised areas, while the least developed states received least funds. The phrase \"local area prefer - ence\" in the Act may have been interpreted as manda - tory and not directory, the report states. Considering Source: Status of Corporate Responsibility India, 2019, Praxis DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWN 11/02/20 1:23 PMSPECIAL /CSRDINESH AGARWAL is former general manager and head of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) department at NTPC. He was the drafting member of Ministry of Corporate Affairs' national guidelines on responsible business conduct. He speaks to Down To Earth on what improvements can be brought about in the sector What are the biggest achievements and challenges of CSR? The biggest achievement is that CSR has created a level playing field among companies. The provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, has ensured that CSR activities involve the board of the company. This guarantees that even the senior-most company official has a clear understanding on CSR. The biggest challenge is that CSR is not fully integrated into the corporate philosophy yet. It is still seen as additional activities that focus on expenditure and not on the projects undertaken. Why has CSR expenditure been more on human development and social welfare schemes? There are many companies that want quick mileage from CSR projects. This is possible by focusing on human development and social welfare. The companies also use these CSR investments to buy peace from the project-affected people. The idea of CSR is that companies should have a clear reason for undertaking a particular project, based on their core competencies, but that is rarely done. There should be long-term vision on CSR projects based on principles such as sustainable development. But companies don't have it. And, as long as they don't have a vision, they will continue to have ad-hoc approach towards CSR. Government reports have found that geographical distribution of CSR spending is skewed and places like aspirational districts are left behind. The real question is what does the government think CSR is, and what do corporates understand it as. The responsibility of CSR project is towards the stakeholders, those who live near the area of operations of companies. Now, the category of aspirational district has been created by the government based on the development level of a particular district. It has nothing to do with the operations of a corporate. So if aspirational districts are far from the area of operation of a corporate, it does not make sense for it to invest there. The corporate's responsibility is towards stakeholders in the area of its operations.However, if an aspirational district is near the area of operation of a company, then it can be incorporated in CSR activities using a long-term plan for the district. Most companies have undertaken CSR projects, but some lack scalability or the ability to replicate. This points to the fact that companies are committed towards CSR. I would blame the government for this. It never asks companies about their long-term visions. All companies have their corporate vision for at least five to 10 years. But when it comes to CSR there is no such vision. And the government does not demand it. The government has kept parameters such as scalability and the ability to replicate a CSR project in considering a company's project for the CSR award. However, there is no award for projects that have actually been scaled up or replicated. With this approach, there is a big gap between the cup and the lip. Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, the number of companies that undertook CSR activities increased, but the amount spent on it dipped. In 2015-16, as many as 18,290 companies spent `14,517 crore, while 21,397 companies spent `13,624 crore in 2017-18. Why did this happen? This can be due to several reasons. The most probable one is that CSR expenditure is stipulated at 2 per cent of a company's net profit, but firms are not making profits nowadays. It is also possible that firms did not find good CSR project to invest in. \"LONG-TERM VISION IS A MUST\" 26 DOWN TO EARTH 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 24-27CSR Special.indd 26 11/02/20 1:24 PMthis, mca issued a directive in 2018 for all companies to follow the law in letter and spirit. State-wise analysis of expendi - ture reveals low concentration of activities Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh received only 9 per cent of the total expenditure from 2014-15 to 2017-18. These states account for more than 55 per cent of the 117 aspirational districts identified by niti Aayog. However, Maharashtra, Kar - nataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Ta - mil Nadu and Delhi, which account for only 11 per cent of the aspira - tional districts, received 40 per cent of the total ex - penditure. \"Companies usually undertake csr activities in areas where work can be done without any hardship. This may be the rea - son that aspirational districts, with their poor infrastructure and devel - opment level, are not in the focus of companies,\" says Narayanan. Further, aspirational districts are not aware of corporates' respon - sibility towards them, says Gayatri Subramaniam, director, Associa - tion of Women in Business, a Delhi-based non-profit. \" niti Aayog has directed only psus to spend in these districts,\" she says. csr activities are similarly scarce in the Northeast. An mca assessment identifies infrastruc - tural gaps here in basic minimum services such as rail, road, water and air connectivity. However, data shows a tiny portion of the funds was spent in the Northeast between 2014-15 and 2017-18. Among the states here, Assam spent the maxi -mum with ` 653.19 spent `24.78 and Meghalaya `24.11, Tripura, Naga - land and Mizoram spent as low as `5.88 crore, ` 3.35 crore and ` 2.41 crore respectively. On the other hand, Maharashtra spent a huge `8,468.28 crore during the period. Subramaniam says, \"There is not enough corporate presence in these states. This could be a reason for the poor expendi - ture here. It is also possible that corporates are un - willing to invest here be - cause some areas are inacces-sible and lack strongimplementation agencies,\" she says. What's more, five years after the Act was enforced, 70 per cent of the companies still do not have a strategy to implement csr ac- tivities. As per the law, companies should set up board level commit - tees, which draw plans for the ef - fective implementation of their projects. According to the iica study, if a firm has a csr policy and committee in place, but does not have an implementation strategy, supports the conclusion that com-panies are more focused on comply - ing with the law and spending csr funds rather than making a seri - ous initiative. Such a behaviour, says the study, could be due to lack of capacity or experience in the de - velopment sector. csr has a huge potential to im - prove the lives of a large number of people in the country. It's `13,624 crore corpus can bring change in a wide variety of sectors. Therefore, it is crucial that companies do not relegate it as a perfunctory exer - cise, but make a meaningful contri - bution to society.

The vision is a set of six challenges, three of which focuses on reducing the CO2 emissions to zero from vehicle, manufacturing and throughout the life cycle and the remaining three focuses on having positive impact on environment by conserving water, establishing circular economy and conserving the biodiversity. The sixth environment challenge aims in \"Establishing the society in harmony with nature\".To realize the same, three clear programs have been developed to achieve the same. Toyota Green Wave, Today for Tomorrow and Education for Sustainable Development programs have been designed to ensure the conservation of biodiversity and developing the eco-minds that will take care of the sustainable development in the future. Toyota Kirloskar Motor, Indian subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation Japan, aligned its program in line with the global vision and came up with various interventions to enhance eco-consciousness among the school children.TOYOTA ECOZONEAt the inception of the Education for Sustainable Development programs, TKM developed \"Green Me\" project through which 35 Government Schools in the Ramanagr District were selected to introduce activity based environmental learning curriculum. The detailed study of the curriculum in the schools gave the insight on the requirement for the experience-based learning center to effectively inculcate eco-consciousness among the citizens of the future. In 2018, TKM opened the gates to our most ambitious and impactful project - the EcoZone - an experiential learning center spread over 17 theme parks across 25 acres at our manufacturing plant in Bidadi, Bangalore.

The strain remains a mystery, its symptoms deceptively similar to common cold and there are no curative or preventive vaccine or medicine. What's certain is that the virus is highly contagious. In just 45 days, it has killed over 1,000 people in China and infected more than 40,000 in 27 countries. Worryingly, we have not yet seen the peak of the spread. Is the world ready to face a pandemic? A report by DOWN TO EARTH 31 PHOTOGRAPH: REUTERSPeople queue up to buy masks in Hong KongPANIC story_coronavirus.indd 31 12/02/20 2:09 PM32 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN COVER STORY /CORONAVIRUSTHE LUNAR New Year break has been uncomfortably long and quiet for almost 50 million people in China. Since January 23, the authorities have locked down some 13 cities, including Wuhan in the province of Hubei, which is the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. Public transport and ride-hailing services have been suspended in this city of 11 million people. Trains and flights from the city have been suspended and people have been asked to leave their houses only for essential reasons like stocking up food. At places, the police has employed drones to ensure that people stay indoors. Travel restrictions and quarantine measures have also left streets, parks and shopping centres deserted in a dozen other cities, including Chibi, Zhejiang, Huangshi, Xiantao, Enshi, Qianjiang and Xiannning. The country's largest metropolis, Shangahi, resembles a ghost city. As many criticise the government's draconian enforcement of epidemic control laws, the government says the measures are to contain the spread of the virus that poses a \"grave threat\" as there is no preventive vaccine or cure for it. But if only travel restrictions and lock- downs could stop this virus. A week later, the School of Public Health at University of Hong Kong, published a paper in The Lancet which said infections may have spilled over to other cities even before the lockdown happened and \"the epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks\". \"Travel restrictions and lockdowns often only delay transmission, not stop it. Transmission is occurring as expected for a respiratory disease that is contagious in very dense urban areas,\" says Nathan Grubaugh, a virologist at the Yale School of Public Health, usa. As of February 10, the new coronavirus\u2014named covid -19 by the World Health Organization ( who) almost one-and-a-half month after the virus was first identified\u2014had infected 42,638 people and killed 1,018 in 27 countries. Most of them are in China. On February 10, Hubei reported 103 deaths in 24 hours. The toll could further rise as at present, 3,000-4,000 new cases are being confirmed every day. \"Some of these cases are likely a backlog in testing and the daily case reports may present onsets that happened weeks ago,\" says Grubaugh. There are other reasons, too. The symptoms are deceptively similar to common cold\u2014the classical symptoms include fever, cough and fatigue. In some people, the virus can remain asymptomatic for up to 14 days and thereby, spread stealthily. Besides, Chinese authorities have been notorious for keeping information under wraps. Consider this. A mathematical model developed by the Johns Hopkins University, usa, to gauge the spread of the virus, estimates that 58,000 people would have been affected in China by January 31. Though government data puts the figure at 11,791, it is difficult to believe given the government's track record. On December 30, 2019, Li Wenliang, a doctor in Wuhan, is believed to have first disclosed about the virus to his medical school alumni group on the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat . The same day, the city's municipal 2:09 PM DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 33 med medical institutions about the patients but warned them not to release treatment information to public. Though on December 31, Wuhan's health authorities announced the outbreak and alerted who, Li was reprimanded by the police for \"spreading rumours online\" and \"severely disrupting social order\". The whistleblower succumbed to covid -19 a week later. NEW BUT FAMILIAR ENEMY The virus is not entirely new to scientists. It belongs to a large family of viruses that have taken the world by storm earlier. In November 2002, a strain of coronavirus, named the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( sars), was first isolated from patients in southern China suffering from pneumonia-like symptoms. Then too, China had kept the illness a secret for months. sars travelled across 24 countries, killing 800 people and infecting another 8,000 before it was contained in July 2003. Almost a decade later, another strain of coronavirus caused the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( mers) in Saudi Arabia. It spread to 27 countries killing 912 people and infecting 2,400 before being contained in 2014. But covid -19 has caused global mayhem in just 31 days (see 'Record spread' on p34). So far, epidemiologists have managed to prepare a preliminary estimation of the epidemic potential of covid -19 and say the basic reproduction number, or R0, of covid -19 is 2.6. This means a person infected with covid -19 can infect 2.6 more susceptible people. In comparison, sars had an R0 of 2; mers had 1. But as more and more studies pour in \u2014some 50 scientific studies have been published on covid -19 in just 20 days of the outbreak \u2014 the value appears to exceed who's estimate that ranged between 1.4 and 2.5. A study published in journal medRxiv on January 29, in fact, estimates that the R0 for covid -19 could climb up to 4.08. A probable reason for this exponential spread is a highly interconnected world (see 'How the virus spread' on p35). A lot has changed since last major outbreaks of sars and mers . Today it takes less than 36 hours for one to travel to any part of the world. Consider Hubei. Its mobility is unmatched\u2014it has a robust rail and bus service and waterways systems. Air travel connects it to 55 cities within the country and 23 international cities. Wuhan alone hosts 23 universities and colleges that attract students from across the globe. Since travel ensures the virus a smooth transmission from person to person, Lunar Year festivities enabled it to spread faster. Scientists and health workers are racing against time to contain its spread. But they are yet to decipher the nature of the virus. \"The global medical fraternity is 'shadow boxing' as the basics are still unknown,\" says who director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. So far, the Chinese authorities identified the source of covid -19 to the Hunan seafood market, where game meat, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, porcupines and camel meat are sold. This market could have provided vital clues and helped researchers identify the real source of the virus. But the local authorities quickly cleaned the market and shut it down.

In fact, scientists who have studied genome sequence of the virus \u2014isolated from blood samples of the initial 41 patients who contracted the virus\u2014say bats could be the host of the virus. On February 7, state news agency Xinhua published a study by South China Agricultural University that says genome sequences of viruses in pangolins is 99 per cent identical to those on coronavirus patients. The study thus suggests that pangolins could be the intermediate host for covid -19. However, researchers are still uncertain on both these counts. They also cannot decipher how the virus will mutate.RESPONSE ASSESSMENT China has built a 1,000-bed hospital in record 10 days, which is a first-of-its-kind intervention in any past outbreak. The government has also announced a financial package of 1 billion Yuan (US $143 million) to Hubei to deal with the crisis. China manufactures 20 million face masks per day; it is now trying to scale up production. However, the magnitude of the outbreak is testing China's health infrastructure. When the crisis began to explode, the region was hit by shortage of testing kits, medicines, masks and hand sanitisers. \"There's severe shortage of medical supplies not just in Wuhan but also in surrounding cities,\" says Wang Xiaodong, governor of Hubei. Other countries too have pressed the panic button or are struggling to RECORD SPREAD From a city in China, the new coronavirus spread to 27 countries in just 31 days 3 India1 Sri Lanka 1 Nepal13 USA 3 Italy 1 Finland1 Sweden8 UK 29263527 21 002814 Germany 11 France1 Belgium 2 Spain3029 31 317 Canada 30 00 Cases 00 Deaths The number of days the new coronavirus took in January this year to travel from China to regions and countries across the world.

Russia and Singapore have shut borders with China. The US and Australia have imposed travel restrictions. Many others have moved towards imposing partial bans. As far as India is concerned, it has cancelled visas of all those travelling from China, except for Indians, and has advised its citizens not visit China for now. There is no safety protocol, but the advisory has been taken on the basis of assessment of the pathogen's virulence, says a health ministry official. About 650 Indians have been evacuated from Wuhan and kept at quarantine centres. Three patients, diagnosed positive for covid -19 in Kerala, had returned from Wuhan. As of February 7, as many 1,275 flights coming from China, Hong Kong and Thailand covering 0.13 million passengers had been screened. In all this, the Union ministry of ayush stunned the world saying certain homeopathic and ayurvedic medicines could prevent the infection. \"This was a irresponsible statement,\" says Asokan K V, secretary of Indian Medical Association. Chinese scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology say they are testing antiviral drugs, which can suppress the activity of the virus, and not necessarily kill it. This drug will soon enter the human trial phase. Globally, various groups of scientists are working to develop a vaccine. However, it may not be easy. Scientists have still not found a vaccine for either sars or mers . Though there has been a pathological optimism about fast development for a weapon against this new, but familiar enemy.HOW THE VIRUS SPREAD Feb 01, 2020 Humans without exposure to animals also start transmitting the virusUnknown animalsDec 31, 2019 New coronavirus affects humans exposed to animalsJan 21, 2020 Virus spreads from infected humans to humans without animal contactBats Humans exposed to animalsHumans exposed to animals Humans without animal contact Infected humans Rapid spread due to mobile population Note: figures as of January 11, 2020. *Information not available.

ADITYA BIRLA GROUP 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INCOVER STORY /CORONAVIRUS A pandemic is an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a wide area, crossing international boundaries and ususally affecting a large number of people,\" says a World Health Organization ( who) bulletin. The covid -19 has already spread to 27 countries and infected over 40,000 people. The past four pandemics were caused by the influenza (flu) virus, therefore the medical discourse has so far been only on flu pandemics. For the past two years, who has been listing pandemic as an important health challenge. \"A pandemic of a new, highly infectious, airborne virus\u2014most likely a strain of influenza\u2014to which most people lack immunity, is inevitable. It is not a matter of \"if\" another pandemic will strike, but \"when\" it will strike,\" who said this year. While who had warned of an impending flu pandemic, nobody expected a new coronavirus to strike first, and in such magnitude. Earlier outbreaks\u2014 sars in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( mers ) in 2012\u2014were also caused by coronaviruses, but were not declared pandemics. Even during the last pandemic in 2009 due to swine flu, the Are we prepared for a pandemic?

Over the years, Himalaya has actively promoted the health and well-being of individuals across all age groups. Our campaign 'Healthy India, Happy India' focuses on health-care by conducting comprehensive health camps in rural, semi-urban, and remote areas.Our recent camp in Mawphlang village, East Khasi Hills, in association with SYNJUK (Ka Synjuk Ki Hima Arliang Wah Umiam Mawphlang Welfare Society), gave the local community access to specialized healthcare services, such as Dental, Ophthalmology, Gynecology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, and General screening. Awareness sessions were conducted on health and hygiene, and free medicines were distributed during the camp. Through this initiative, we reached out to over 1000 individuals. Similar camps have also been conducted in Rajasthan and in more than 40 government schools in Bengaluru. 39Himalaya Feb 2020_Healthy India, Happy India.indd 39 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INreproduction (R0)\u2014infected people transferring infection to other affecting others\u2014was 1.3-1.8; for covid -19, it is 2.6. The fact that the outbreak is assuming pandemic proportions has been established in a research paper published in medRxiv by three researchers from health institutes in Glasgow and Lancaster in the UK and Florida in the US. They state that the total number of cases just within Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, would be greater than 190,000. (See 'Peak season for...' on p 42.)ARRIVAL OF THE ZOONOTIC Though we do not know when and where the next pandemic will surface, we do know how it will emerge. \"The next pandemic will be a zoonotic disease,\" Jonathan Epstein, vice-president of Science and Outreach at EcoHealth Alliance, a science-based non-profit in New York, told Down To Earth . Zoonotic diseases are caused by infections that spread from animals to humans. EcoHealth Alliance says waterfowls will host the flu pandemic, while bats and rodents would be the source for a coronavirus pandemic. \"Over the last 15 years, we've found dozens of novel sars-related coronaviruses in bats in China and other parts of the world. Our research has shown that people in China hunt bats that are known to carry viruses linked to sars and novel coronavirus. Those exposed to these host animals earlier have developed antibodies against these viruses, which means they've been exposed to them and can spread the disease,\" says Epstein. It is not a coincidence that China is the country of origin of three of last four pandemics. \"While we can't predict from where the next influenza pandemic is going to emerge, there are certain places that need particular attention. And, China is the place of all of them,\" said Dennis Carrol, former director of emerging threats division of United States Agency for International Development, in a Netflix series, Pandemic (see 'History of pandemics'). After the outbreak, China imposed a temporary ban on wildlife trade across the country. \"What we need is not a temporary ban, but permanent regulations for wildlife trade in China. What is not required is the elimination of wildlife. We need to adjust the way we do things so that we safely live alongside wildlife by limiting opportunity for outbreaks to occur,\" Epstein suggested. The World Wide Fund for Nature has issued a similar statement. Though no direct has been established between covid -19 outbreak and climate COVER STORY /CORONAVIRUS All the four pandemics the world has seen so far were zoonotic diseases SPANISH FLU 1918-20 Deaths 50 million Host animal Waterfowl ASIAN FLU 1957-58 Deaths1.5 million Host animal PigHONG KONG FLU 1968-70 Deaths2 million Host animal Pig SWINE FLU 2009-10 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 41 change, but studies say warming temperatures and melting of ice are exposing new viruses to the ecosystem. For instance, researchers recently found 33 viruses trapped in the Tibetan glacier. Out of these, 28 were completely new to science and all of them had the potential to cause an outbreak. The study was published in bioRxiv on January 7, 2020. As ice melts, viruses are being released in the air, which would travel through rivers and streams, infecting humans. Also, as the world is urbanising at a rapid pace, natural habitats are being destroyed. This has further exposed us to a host of new viruses for which we have no immunity. So how many people will be affected in a future pandemic? \"The 1918 global influenza pandemic sickened one-third of the world's population and killed as many as 50 million people\u20142.8 per cent. If a similar contagion occurred today with a population four times larger and travel time anywhere in the world less than 36 hours, 50-80 million people could perish,\" who warned in a 2019 report. On any given day, more than 10,000 flights operate globally, and this explains how inter-connectivity will accelerate this spread. \"During the Ebola epidemic in 2014, models estimate that without travel restrictions, 7.17 infected passengers per month would have departed from highly-affected countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to various destinations around the globe,\" say Pierrot Derjany and his colleagues from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, usa. As a pre-emptive move, the global airline industry has cancelled flights now because it does not want to become the virus carrier. Biritish Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Delta Airlines, Egypt Air, Air India, Air Canada, Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, FinnAir, Hainan Airlines, Israel Airlines, American Airlines and Air Tanzania have called off all or a few select flights within a couple of weeks of the outbreak in China.So there is no doubt that an outbreak of a large-scale pandemic will rattle the global economy. The World Bank estimates that a global influenza pandemic akin to the scale and virulence of the one in 1918 would cost the world economy US $3 trillion, or up to 4.8 per cent of the world's gdp. The cost would be 2.2 per cent of gdp for even a moderately virulent influenza pandemic. ARE WE PREPARED? The answer to this question depends on three conditions: nobody knows what virus will cause the pandemic; how virulent will it be; how many people would be killed or infected; and, if any symptomatic treatment will work. The shocking thing is that no country has developed precautionary safety protocols as prescribed by who\u2014planning and coordination, situation monitoring and assessment, prevention and containment of virus, health systems response and communication for awareness. \"National health security is fundamentally weak around the world. No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics, and every country has important gaps to address,\" warns the Global Health Security ( ghs) Index report prepared by the Johns Hopkins University and Nuclear Threat Initiative. There are certain parameters upon which countries are ranked. On a scale of 100, almost all countries scored only 40.2. Less than 7 per cent countries scored better in terms of prevention of pandemic. Worse, less than 5 per cent countries had a rapid response strategy, says the report. A British Medical Journal paper on global preparedness published last year highlighted the most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries were clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia. But coronavirus is also becoming a great leveller. It is attacking both rich and poor THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZA - TION SAYS IT IS NOT A MATTER OF \"IF\" ANOTHER PANDEMIC WILL STRIKE, BUT \"WHEN\" IT WILL STRIKE TURN TO P44 38-46Cover story_coronavirus.indd 41 2:24 PM42 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN\"Peak for coronavirus is yet to come\" ERIC FEIGL-DING , an epidemiologist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, USA, spoke to DOWN TO EARTH Do you believe in reports that there was a cover-up by China in early December?I do not want to go into the politics of cover-up, but I do believe that China delayed a little bit in ramping up public health facilities in the initial days due to which crucial time was lost. More significantly, even at present a lot of underdiagnosis is happening because the labs have reached saturation point and are facing shortage. So the actual number of cases can be much higher. What about the controversy in the number of people affected?It is true that the number of cases is high. You may still not be counting the milder cases. There are reports that patients are being turned away in Wuhan. Everyone agrees the difference could be of eight times at least in the epicentre. WHO has not announced bans, but many countries have imposed full or partial bans. No doubt the transmission rate is very high. But before imposing blanket bans, countries would keep people coming from China under quaratine for 14 days\u2014the incubation time period. This was a pragmatic approach. And one has to understand whether such travel bans, if at all they were to be implemented, were required only for Wuhan city, the epicentre of the outbreak, or entire China. Countries should be rational about it. What about the fact that human-to-human transmission has happened in more than five countries other than China?It has happened, but it is restricted to close family members. How much is this coronavirus outbreak comparable with SARS? The reproductive number (R0) of SARS varied from 2 to 2.5, at some places even 4. The R0 of this outbreak is nearly 2.6. But what is important is SARS took three months to reach a number of close to 8,000. In the case of COVID -19, in a little over one month's time, we are close to a tally of 41,000. This exponential growth should worry us while we still do not know the exact reasons for it. In the case of SARS outbreak, there were hardly any asymptomatic cases. But in the current outbreak, there are many. This poses a great challenge to us because they may go unreported and later lead to infections. Have the number of cases peaked? What can you say about the possible trajectory? It is very difficult to talk about a possible trajectory, but one thing can be said that the peak is yet to happen. This is expected by the end of February, after which the cases may begin to come down. Viruses do not usually like summers. 38-46Cover story_coronavirus.indd 42 12/02/20 2:10 4:30 PM44 DOWN TO EARTH 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN COVER STORY /CORONAVIRUSCOVER STORY /CORONAVIRUS countries. And there is no vaccine available. So those in rich countries are surviving only on symptomatic treatment. Since the world was sure that the next pandemic would be a flu pandemic, efforts have centred around developing the universal flu vaccine\u2014the one which will give protection against existing and future strains of flu. The US-based National Institute of Allergy and infectious Diseases is leading one of the initiatives to develop a universal flu vaccine. \"At present, seasonal influenza vaccines protect only against the existing strains of H1N1, H3N2 and two influenza B viruses. The next generation vaccine will provide protection against more than these four viruses and hopefully against other circulating strains and also the future ones that may emerge,\" Jennifer Gordon, influenza vaccines program officer with US' National Institutes of Health, told Down To Earth . The vaccine will provide 75 per cent immunity; existing vaccines are providing only 10-60 per cent immunity. There are several probable candidates for a universal flu vaccine\u2014many are under clinical trials and one has already reached the last phase, the human trial, as animal studies have shown positive results. \"However, we don't know when the final product will be out and what it would cost,\" says Gordon. who and philanthropic bodies are funding such research initiatives. Though there are many public and private initiatives to develop a universal flu vaccine, there are only a few projects in infancy to find a vaccine for coronaviruses. But whatever be the nature of the next pandemic\u2014be it a coronavirus or a flu virus\u2014what would be immediately requi- red for the world is to contain the spread of the virus from one place to another. A researcher at the Bonn Faculty of Medicine in Germany looks at bat and human cell culture models to characterise and compare TO EARTH 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN COVER STORY /CORONAVIRUSThough it has been criticised for its methods, China placed 13 big cities under full or partial lockdown, affecting about 50 million people, to contain the spread. This is happening for the first time in history anywhere in the world. Undoubtedly, this caused hardships to people and experts are divided over its efficacy. On the one hand, China has locked down its affected regions and on the other, many countries have strictly advised its citizens not to travel to China. So, are there any protocols for such bans? Globally, countries have taken stringent decisions to safeguard their citizens. Russia and Singapore have shut borders with China. The US and Australia have also imposed travel restrictions. Many other countries have moved towards imposing partial bans. But who stands alone. As countries have taken safety measures on their own, who has looked at the tottering economy and not issued a single travel advisory. In fact, Michael Ryan, who's director for health emergencies programme, defends this stance. \"If all 191 countries behave in a manner they wish to, there will be no alignment in our response and it will only add to the problem,\" says Ryan. who is expected to take the lead during such emergencies, but has supped with China and has defended it. It did not reprimand China for delaying the news of the outbreak. Ironically, the Chinese authorities admit the cost of delay. \"It's a moment of shame. If we had taken strong measures earlier, the outbreak would have been under control,\" Ma Guoqiang, Wuhan Communist Party Secretary, told the state broadcaster China Central Television on February 1. who's ambiguous position on covid -19 should force countries across the world to devise strategies, build health and emergency infrastructure. Meanwhile, to follow what trajectory the novel coronavirus takes, watch this space. DTE @down2earthindia \"WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE UNKNOWN\" THOUGH MANY experts say the coronavirus outbreak is close to a pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) does not believe so. At present, we are in the phase where it's an epidemic with multiple foci, and we will try to extinguish the transmission in each of these foci. Previous coronaviruses including SARS and MERS didn't lead to a pandemic when they first emerged. However, we still do not know much about this virus. That's why WHO is monitoring the evolution of this outbreak every minute with a network of scientists, clinicians, disease trackers, governments, supply chain experts and partners from the public and private sector. In fact, WHO declared the new coronavirus COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. This the sixth time a PHEIC has been declared\u2014 the previous ones were H1N1 in 2009, Polio in 2014, Ebola in West Africa in 2014, Zika in 2016, Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019. Following the declaration of a PHEIC, WHO has issued temporary recommendations. These measures address travel, trade, quarantine, screening and treatment to make sure countries are prepared to deal with this outbreak. They can also set global standards of practice in these areas. WHO is also working towards reducing secondary infections amongst close contacts and healthcare workers; preventing transmission amplification events and super spreading events (which happened in the case of SARS); and, preventing further spread. To reduce zoonotic transmission, we need to identify animal source(s) and limit exposure; equip countries to detect, isolate and provide healthcare for infected patients; and, provide optimised care. We also need to address the unknown through clinical severity, treatment options, epidemiologic studies, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.

In 2015, Cochin airport became the world's first to be completely powered by solar energy. It produces about 40 MW and saves over R1 crore annually in power bills PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY: UN ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMMEIN 2015 when India announced that 40 per cent of the 100 GW of solar power targeted under the National Solar Mission ( nsm) 2022 will be sourced from solar rooftop ( srt) systems, the task ap - peared simple. Although large solar farms, which are responsible for generating 60 per cent of the target under nsm, are a cost-effective way of harnessing solar energy, the idea of sourcing one's own electricity just by putting panels on the rooftop is alluring. However, with two years to the deadline, srt sector appears nowhere near the target. Data with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy ( mnre ) shows that by December 2019 the country has added only 2.3 GW from grid-connected srt systems. \"We have actually managed to in - stall 1.9 GW of grid-connected srt systems under nsm,\" Aujender Sin - gh, deputy secretary, mnre , tells Down To Earth . \"It's a mistake to place the srt sector in a silo,\" Singh says, suggesting to increase the scope of large solar farms to meet the 100 GW target. The suggestion sounds bizarre at a time when countries worldwide are promoting srt systems. For in - stance, srt systems account for 57 per cent of Australia's total solar power capacity.

Then why is the srt sector not able to take off in India? Understanding this is important at a time when the government is roll - ing out phase-II of Grid Connected Rooftop ( gcrt) Solar Programme to give new impetus to the srt sector. So far, srt sector has largely re - mained a non-performer in India because installing it and recovering the investment is an arduous task for residential consumers. In Delhi, says Ashok Kumar Jha, assistant general manager with Indraprastha Power Generation Company Ltd, several residents welfare associati- ons ( rwas) had to scrap srt projects after they failed to arrange financi - ers. Banks consider the projects as high-risk loan despite the Reserve Bank of India including the sector in its \"priority sector lending\" norms. Subsidies on srt systems, as assured by the government, are also hard to come by. In 2017, the rwa of Wellington Estate in Gurugram, Haryana, installed a 200 kW srt system by paying `1.05 crore from its own pocket. \"We should have re - ceived 30 per cent of subsidy soon after installing the system but are yet to get it,\" says resident Vineeth Bagga. In Thiruvananthapuram, installed a 15 kW grid-connected srt system in 2018. Though he could avail the subsidy within a couple of months and now saves almost `1.4 lakh a year on his electricity bills, it will take him more than seven years to recover the investment. Thaha is, however, worried about the payment he is supposed to receive for the excess electricity his srt system feeds into the grid. Like most prosumers (producer-consumers), Thaha has installed a net-meter, under which the surplus electricity generated is supplied to the grid. discoms allow prosumers to \"bank\" this power for a year and draw it back at any point. At the end of the \"banking\" period, dis - coms compensate consumers for any excess generation. But when he approached the Kerala State Elect- ricity Board, officials said they were still working on a tariff plan for compensating him. Moreover, there are examples of inordinate delay in installation of net-meters. The Ta - mil Nadu Generation and Distribu - tion Corporation Ltd admits to year-long delays in installing net- meters in 2017, which rendered all srt systems worthless for the period. BUT BIG ONES BENEFIT The only segment that appears to have benefitted are commercial and industrial ( c&i) establishments. They are responsible for 70 per cent of all srt systems, as per Bridge to India, a leading knowledge service provider in the Indian renewable energy market. Apart from the huge rooftop space available at c&i establishments and their techno - logical and maintenance capability, the reason they have taken to srt is the economic benefit it provides in a relatively short period. Since the power tariff for commercial instal - lations in India is much higher than what it is for the residential sector, c&i establishments can recover their capital investment in just five years. A case in point is Cochin airport, which has a 40 MW instal - lation that powers all its operations. \"Annually, the system saves the airport a significant R1.1 crore, which will help us recover the cost in four to five years,\" says Satish Kumar Pai, chief engineer, Cochin International Airport Ltd. Unfortunately, c&i establish - ments will no longer be eligible for government subsidy in gcrt phase- II. This might dampen the interest of the only segment that has exhib - ited an appetite for srt systems. What's worse, under the new re - gime, discoms that have been drag - ging their feet over srt system installations, will be the sole facili - tators. They will also be responsible for subsidy disbursal, notes the guidelines issued in August 2019 . While the guidelines have set pa - rameters for incentivising discoms for creating an ecosystem for expe - ditious implementation of srt pro- jects, it appears too small for the cash-strapped utilities . Industry experts offer a few suggestions that can help the coun - try realise its full rooftop solar po - tential. Neha Agrawal, head of corporate strategy, Vikram Solar, says the government should offer easy financing options, set up a larger fund for srt subsidies and ensure their faster disbursal. Ritu Lal, senior vice-president at Am - plus Solar, however, suggests the need for structural reforms in elec - tricity tariff. For a large segment of households, electricity tariffs do not reflect the true cost of electricity supply. Reserving these subsidies only for the poor and agricultural communities will force high-income households to shift to cheaper srt systems.

BOOKWhy common spaces remain almost ignored in urban planning P52Discrepancy in universe's expansion rates could indicate some new physics P56 51Palette 51 10/02/20 11:43 AMThe battle to save Aarey forest, where the authorities resorted to midnight chopping of some 2,000 trees to make way for the Metro Rail car shed, has grown into one of the most prominent environmental campaigns in recent months. As citizens and environmentalists call out that construction inside Mumbai's last remaining lungs will affect the temperatures and rains, and result in huge floodings in the city, the movement highlights the growing frustration among people due to poorly conceived urban growth and chaos. Be it parks, public squares, green spaces or sidewalks, urban folks are increasingly realising the importance of shared spaces in providing clean air and water supply, preventing floods droughts and heatwaves and ensuring their physical and mental well-being. Then, why are urban planners hesitant to re-imagine the urban commons? JITENDRA reaches out to experts to understand the scope and limitations.Can we triumph over tragedy of commons? \"Commons are almost ignored in city planning\" The word commons evokes the imagery of a rural landscape\u2014a village with ponds and grazing lands surround-ed by forests. Though commons are equally essential for cities, the fact remains almost ignored in urban policy and planning. Thus, in the heart of Bengaluru, cows graze on the edges of lakes and community fishing is practised in waste weirs; and in Mumbai, adivasis hunt and forage for food in Sanjay Gandhi National Park and Agaris use coastal and creek-side land for salt panning. We have forgotten that the commons act as a nutritional buffer and safety net for migrants who flock to cities from distressed parts of the country by providing them with wild plants, greens and brushwood, places to bathe, defecate, wash clothes and protec - tion from winter nights. The middle class and wealthy residents of the city are no less dependent on the commons, though they may not recognise the extent of it. Lakes, parks, wetlands, rivers and even roadside trees play a role in cleaning the air, raising groundwater levels and maintaining people's physical and mental well-being. Yet, across cities the commons seem to be the most dispensable of spaces. Forests like Mum - bai's Aarey are threat - ened for infrastructure projects, wetlands in Thiruvananthapuram acquired for technoparks and trees in South Delhi felled to build apart - ments. While the ecologi - cal consequences of the HARINI NAGENDRA Professor of sustainability, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru /DEBATE 52-54Debate.indd 52 10/02/20 11:43 AMdamage (which include floods, droughts and heat waves) are widely discussed, the social outcomes receive less attention. Commons represent those rare spaces in increasingly segregated cities where the rich and the poor can still meet, children of all classes play together and collaborations for conser - vation can occur. However, smart city plans and restoration projects take an approach that de-commonises the commons by evicting people who depend on them most. Beach sides, river fronts, lakes and parks become gated spaces, accessible only to those who can pay, and available only for recre - ational use, often coupled with \"entertainment\" in the form of flashing lights, loud music and food courts that evict wildlife. Our cities can hold out any promise of a better future only if the commons play a central role in urban planning. \"Local bodies must take lead\" Traditionally, the commons were managed sustainably by communi - ties whose culture and livelihoods were intrinsi - cally linked with them. Over last few decades, unplanned urbanisation, commercialisation of land, encroachments and over-exploitation of resources and unravel -ling of traditional structures have resulted in their deterioration. There is also a pronounced lacuna in the governance and regulations of urban commons. In recent years, civil society groups and citizen-activ - ists have stepped in to fill this gap. Some notable models include the initiative by The Nature Conservancy in Chennai to restore wetlands through scientific reclamation of lakes and catchment areas by involving local communities; civic engagement in lake management in Benga - luru through partner - ship with the authori - ties; and the movement for a \" raahgiri \" (car free) day for use of roads by residents in Delhi. The moot question is how to replicate and scale up such \"islands of excellence\". The gover - nance of urban commons should be integrated with the \"right to the city\" initiatives. Local governments should lead the way in setting up regulations, providing incentives and mentor - ing start-ups by millen - nials. These measures may result in the transformation of the \"tragedy of the com - mons\" into a triumph. \u00aaDevelop financing framework\u00ba In legal and technical terms, urban commons are owned by local bodies and thus are not un - owned or pure commons. But in practice, they are open access and close to \"pure commons\".

Cooperative or commu-nity funding also be - comes difficult as most urban commons do not have clearly defined, limited and stable pool of appropriators. This is the reason, financing of the urban commons by the private sector or by communities is confined to development and maintenance of traffic islands, parks, stadiums, streets or footpaths, that too in a limited number. So, urban commons are mainly dependent on governments, particu - larly local governments that are more often than not financially weak. The result is inadequate or no financing of the urban commons. There is an urgent need to come out with clear-cut policies, regulations and financ - ing frameworks or mechanisms for urban commons so that their development, mainte - nance and regulation can take place through investment by private and social sectors. \"Rethink their management\" As cities re-emerge as capitalist utopia for investors and consumers, the \"commons\" get converted into \"commodi - ties\". This loss of urban \"commons\" and \"com - muning\" among larger public have a direct impact on the way a city and its society are structured. Today, what can be considered as the \"commons\" is no more limited to the traditional understanding of shared natural resources but include a wide spectrum of urban elements, from ecological commons such as water bodies, air and landfills, to civic com - mons such as markets, parks, gardens, public transportation and sanitation systems. It also includes intangible aspects, such as socio-cultural commons that consist of various forms of art and customs, collective practices, equitable value genera - tion and collaborative digital platforms. The concept of communing, however, has been largely confined to guerrilla actions to co-produce and self-manage community gardens or reclaim derelict spaces and turn them into community hubs, like pop-up plazas and parklets in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. However, the big question is how can the public or community govern and design the areas they share in common. Traditionally, the commons were governed by customary rights of communities. For commoning to once again become main -stream, it would require new forms of collective governance, also referred to as multi-stakeholder governance in which the community or public is not just a user but partner with the state authorities and other players, such as social innovators, knowledge institutions and civil society groups. The commons must function outside of the capitalist market demand and be co-designed by communities and other stakeholders. Here, the designer acts as a facilitator while the design provides a frame - work that enables communities to work together to produce and govern commons that are accessible, safe and of high quality. Planners can play a role by identi - fying and allocating the commons as well as developing mechanisms to co-fund initiatives that revive the traditional commons and develop new urban commons.

LAST YEAR, A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS CALCULATED THAT THIS RATE OF EXPANSION IS 10 PER CENT HIGHER THAN THE EARLIER CALCULATION. AKSHIT SANGOMLA SPEAKS TO ABRAHAM LOEB, CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ASTRONOMY AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, ABOUT THE REASONS BEHIND THE DISCREPANCIES IN UNIVERSE'S EXPANSION RATES AND THE FORCES PULLING THE UNIVERSE APART\"DISCREPANCY IN UNIVERSE'S EXPANSION RATES COULD INDICATE SOME NEW PHYSICS\" The expansion of the universe is accelerating and scientists do not seem to agree on its rate. Why?All observers agree that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (owing to \"dark energy\", whose nature we do not understand, but which represents the energy of vacuum without matter). But there is a debate regarding the expansion rate. We can infer the expansion rate that the universe should have today based on the data we have on the cosmic microwave background [ cmb is an elusive radiation that emanated at or after the birth of the universe and extrapolating its trajectory to present time is one of the ways to calculate the expansion of the universe]. But some observers who measure the actual expansion rate today argue that their measured value disagrees with the expected value at a statistically significant level. Some scientists are calling for new physics to explain the discrepancies. What could this new physics be?The discrepancy in expansion rates could indicate some new physics or some unexpected behaviour of dark matter and dark energy between the time when the cosmic microwave background was produced (400,000 years after the Big PHOTOGRAPHS COURTESY: HARVARD.EDU Palette /INTERVIEW 56 DOWN TO EARTH 16-29 FEBRUARY 2020 56-57Science/Interview.indd 56 10/02/20 11:44 AMBang) and today. We do not know if that is the case. [Scientists estimate that 27 per cent of the universe is dark matter which does not absorb, emit or reflect light and whose existence is inferred only from the gravitational effect it seems to exert on visible matter.] How close are we from under- standing the true nature of dark energy and dark matter? We have evidence that there is much more matter out there than the ordinary matter we are made of. First, the inhomogeneities at early times would have been smoothed out by the radiation if there was only ordinary matter. There needs to be a type of matter that does not couple to the radiation in order for galaxies like the Milky Way to form. Second, when we look at galaxies, we infer that they must contain much more mass than the visible mass of their gas and stars. This was known for 70 years, since Fritz Zwicky inferred that clusters of galaxies contain much more matter than their visible mass. But we still have no clue as to the nature of that dark matter. It is most likely made of particles that do not couple to light (this being the reason that we cannot see them), but we do not know what particles these are. The breakthrough in our understanding could come from laboratory experiments. There were hopes that new particles will be produced and discovered at the Large Hadron Collider or other experiments, but so far we have had no success. How sure are scientists about the Big Bang Theory as the event with which it all began? The Big Bang model is supported by a large body of evidence. It postulates that the universe started from a hot dense state, and we have detected the relic radiation left over from that state. The model also assumes that the initial state was nearly uniform with small inhomogeneities that grew over time due to the attractive force of gravity to make the structure we see today in the form of galaxies and stars, of which the Milky Way hosting our Sun are examples. Indeed, we find the cosmic microwave background to have almost exactly the same brightness in all directions in the sky with small variations of the appropriate magnitude, reflecting the expected initial state. The model also predicts the abundan-ces of light elements, like helium, deuterium and lithium, which were cooked in the first few minutes of the cosmic expansion after the Big Bang (when the universe as a whole was hotter than the interior of stars). The predicted abundances agree with observations. Altogether, the data we have provides robust support to the Big Bang model but it also leads to intriguing questions: (i) What led to the Big Bang? In the very first instants, quantum mechanics was as important as gravity, but we still do not have a theory that unifies these two pillars of modern physics and so we cannot predict what may have happened before the Big Bang. (ii) We infer from cosmological data that most of the matter and energy in the present-day universe are dark. We call them \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\", but these are just labels that signify our ignorance. What will the near and far future of the universe look like with and without humans? Without humans: in a few billion years, the Milky Way will collide with its nearest neighbour, the Andromeda galaxy and the night sky will change. In about seven billion years, the Sun will die. First it will expand to a red giant and possibly engulf the Earth and then its core will cool and contract to make a \"white dwarf\", a piece of dense metal the size of the Earth. Most of the stars have a mass that is 10 times lower than that of the Sun and they will continue to shine for up to 10 trillion years (1,000 times longer than the Sun). After that, there will be darkness. If the accelerated expansion of the universe continues, it will become a dark and lonely place with our galaxy (the merger product of the Milky Way and Andromeda) surrounded by vacuum. With humans: since technology evolves exponentially with a time constant of a few years, we will witness vast advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and genetics. Within a thousand years, humans will build machines that transcend them and can venture into a long journey into space. 3D printers equipped with AI will produce life as we know it on other planets out of the raw materials there. We might also find evidence for other civilisations that are far more advanced than we are. DTE @aks7489MOST OF THE MATTER AND ENERGY IN THE PRESENT-DAY UNIVERSE ARE DARK.

As Donald Trump comes visiting later in February, a number of organisations are on edge about the kind of deal that Narendra Modi is likely to sign with the US President since his government has shown a readiness to address the concerns of major trade partners such as Japan by offering a controversial fast tracking of patent approvals. Reports hint at a mini deal with the US since a full-blown Free Trade Agreement ( fta) is still in the making and fears are that intellectual property (IP) is likely to be a major focus because this is an issue that has loomed large over India's trade negotiations with the US, Japan and the European Union. In the case of the US, it has been a constant irritant with Washington keeping up a fierce campaign against crucial parts of India's patent law, particularly those covering pharmaceuticals. A fixed point of dispute has been Section 3d of the law which seeks to curb the notorious tendency of Big Pharma to extend its drug patents through minor tweaks to the original drug. After a failed case in India's Supreme Court, the US has kept up its attack on India's patent regime, with its Super 301 review never failing to target India. With a trade deal in the works, civil society groups have been urging Modi not to negotiate an fta with US, primarily because it would impede access to affordable healthcare in India where availability of low-cost generic medicines have provided a lifeline to millions of poor patients. These groups have said they are aware that the US has sought specific amendments to the Indian Patents Act, which would undermine \"India's public health friendly patent laws\". The worry now is that Trump arrives triumphant in Delhi on the back of a new trade pact he has just signed with China. The Phase One trade deal he signed on January 15 sets up patent protections in China that are similar to those in the US and it would be worthwhile for officials of India's Commerce Ministry \u2014and, of course, activists\u2014 to study what Washington has actually secured from Beijing. The most disquieting concession is China agreeing to implement patent linkage and patent term extension. Patent linkage is dangerous because it means that marketing approval for a generic drug cannot be granted before the expiry of the patent on the original drug. This would delay the entry of cheaper generic medicines and protect brand drugs from competition. Big Pharma appears to be the big winner since Beijing has agreed to even extend the patent term in case of regulator delays, leading industry analysts to hail the IP concessions signed by the Xi Jinping government as the most significant part of the deal. But even as some are crowing, other analysts emphasise that much will depend on how China abides by the deal. Some measures are said to be old promises which China is implementing in its own way. Perhaps, Delhi needs to learn from the Chinese how to keep Trump happy without losing the plot.

To be effective, it requires the active involvement of all concerned stakeholders. There is a genuine need to develop the capacity of all concerned stakeholders including regulators to screen and scope the EIA process, to conduct transparent public consultations and to evaluate the EIA reports. At the same time, there is a need among environmental managers and NGOs to review and interpret EIA report; and for consultants, institutions and academicians to conduct an effective EIA process. Centre for Science and Environment recognises this need and has developed a hands-on five-day training programme aimed at giving exposure to the participants on EIA with specific reference to mining, power sector and infrastructure projects (road and highway). After the programme, the participants shall have an understanding of: 1. Legal requirements: Environmental Clearance Process, Circulars and Office Memorandums and other Laws and regulations applicable on projects 2.
