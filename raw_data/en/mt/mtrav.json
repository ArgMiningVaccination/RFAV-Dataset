OLIVA~ Most of the laboratories that manufac- ture vaccines for human use in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean were established at the beginning of this cen- tury and have already earned their place in history through their work in control- ling and eradicating diseases of public health importance. Nevertheless, vacci- nation has existed in this region since the early 19th century, when the varioliza- tion technique (whereby healthy individ- uals were inoculated with material from smallpox vesicles from the benign form of the disease) was introduced, this being followed by vaccination against smallpox based on Edward Jenner's development of a smallpox vaccine derived from cow- pox lesions (2). By the early 20th century, a technique developed to propagate virus vaccines on the skin of cattle or sheep was already being used by several laboratories in the 'This report will also be published in Spanish in the Boletin de la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana, Vol. 117, No. 3, 1994. 2Regional Adviser in Biologics, PAHO/WHO. \"Bureau of 5Bio-Manguinhos, FIOCRUZ, Brazil. 256 Bulletin of PAHO .28(3), 1994 Region. Also, around this time Dr. Vital Brasil showed the importance of the specificity of antivenom sera for the treat- ment of snakebites-a technology dis- seminated throughout the world that represented significant progress in this field. During the first half of the century, in the 193Os, the vaccine against yellow fe- ver (strain 17D) was developed by the Rockefeller Foundation in collaboration with researchers in the Region (2); and some years later, in the mid-1950s, a method for producing rabies vaccine in newborn mouse brains was developed by E. Fuenzalida and R. Palacios (3). This latter method is used to this day by lab- oratories in the region because of its sim- plicity, high degree of efficacy, low levels of adverse reactions, and manufacture based on readily available raw materials. In recent years Cuban scientists have developed methods for manufacturing vaccines against serogroup B meningo- coccal meningitis (4) and also against hepatitis B, the latter employing recom- binant DNA (5); Argentine researchers, in collaboration with the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in the United States, have developed a live attenuated vaccine against Argentine hemorrhagic fever (6); and a Colombian research group led by M.E. Patarroyo has developed a synthetic antimalarial vaccine that is now in the last stages of clinical evaluation (7). CURRENT TECHNOLOGIC CHALLENGES In recent decades vaccine manufactur- ing technology has made major strides in a number of areas. On the one hand, a series of standards and strict specific pro- cedures have been established as \"Good Manufacturing Practices\" (GMP) (8-12) to guarantee the quality of vaccines pro- duced. On the other hand, manufactur- ing technology has been improved so as to provide better vaccine purity and greater yields. To keep up with these advances, lab- oratories in developed countries, as well as a few in the developing world, have invested large sums of money to upgrade existing installations, build new ones, and acquire more sophisticated modern equipment. However, the sizable invest- ments required, the degree of technical complexity involved, and stiff competi- tion have tended to concentrate vaccine manufacture in the hands of a few very large laboratories. In addition, there has been a trend toward globalizing technol- ogic activities and forming strategic alli- ances to share technology, products, and markets in order to reduce development costs, financial risks, and monetary losses. With respect to meeting today's quality control standards, a need has arisen for modern techniques capable of detecting impurities and characterizing various vaccine components with increased ac- curacy. This demand, in turn, has cre- ated a need for up-to-date specialized equipment. Virtually all the laboratories manufac- turing vaccines for human use in Latin America and the Caribbean are public laboratories that are directly or indirectly under the jurisdiction of the State. In varying quantities, they manufacture all the vaccines used in the Expanded Pro- gram on Immunization (BCG, DTP, DT, Td, oral poliomyelitis, and measles vac- cines), as well as the Fuenzalida-Palacios rabies vaccine, the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, and vaccines against yellow fever and meningococcal meningitis ser- ogroups A, B, C, and W. The few private laboratories manufacturing vaccines for human use are very small and have hardly any impact on the market. One point convincingly driven home at the September 1990 World Summit for Children was that millions of children's lives could be saved by improving vac- cine quality and developing new low-cost vaccines for use in public health pro- grams. Accordingly, development agen- cies and the scientific and technologic community were specifically asked to re- double their efforts to this end. As part of this drive, the World Health Organization, United Nations Develop- ment Program (UNDP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Rocke- feller Foundation organized what has be- come known as the \"Children's Vaccine Initiative\" (13). In connection with this work, a number of desired technologic developments have been identified and are currently being pursued. One of these is the production of an improved DTP vaccine and utilization of DTP as a basis for new vaccine combinations. DTP vac- cine was singled out for attention partly because it is administered to very young children and partly because it will prob- ably be needed for many years. These new vaccines, improved and/or combined with other antigens, are al- ready being produced by several labo- ratories in the developed countries. Therefore, the questions are whether lab- oratories in Latin America and the Car- ibbean area are technologically prepared Special Report 257 to participate in this new phase involving the manufacture of improved vaccines, what principal obstacles are currently being encountered in their manufactur- ing operations, what their technologic potential is, and what new mechanisms are available for exchanging technology. Above all, it is important to establish vi- able procedures for immunizing the 11 million children born each year in Latin America and the Caribbean against dis- eases preventable by vaccination. ANALYSIS OF REGIONAL LABORATORIES' TECHNICAL CAPACITY To obtain appropriate technical in- formation and assess the technical ca- pacity of the 13 laboratories in the re- gion presently producing DTP vaccine (Table 1), PAHO's Regional Vaccine System Table 1.

The results of these visits were presented at the First Re- gional Meeting on Improved DTP and DTP-based Combination Vaccines, a con- ference sponsored by PAHO/SIREVA in collaboration with the Children's Vaccine Initiative that was held in Washington, D.C., in September 1993. Data from this survey and the corresponding technical assessments are presented on the pages that follow. DTP Production and Demand: Current Status and Future Projections If the nine DTP producing countries are grouped according to subregions (the Southern Cone, the Caribbean, the An- dean area, and Mexico and Central America), it may be seen that the South- ern Cone subregion (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay) has the highest de- mand and the highest projected capacity. Cuba has projected production well above its own needs and has plans to export DTP vaccine. Production and demand in the other subregions will be fairly well bal- anced once the producing countries reach their projected production capacities. The figures for installed capacity were calculated taking into account the current installations and existing equipment, as well as present possibilities for improv- ing production yields. Laboratory pro- duction volume was found to vary from 0.4 million doses per year to 9 million. Even though the overall reported pro- duction capacity was said to approach 39 million doses a year, total 1992 produc- tion came to only 22.3 million doses, cor- responding to 57.3% of stated production capacity or 24.7% of the annual demand in all the region's countries, which was estimated at 90.2 million doses. 2.58 Bulletin of PAHO 28(3), 1994 Table 2.

The other laboratories hsted are still working on proposals. \"Information presented at the First RegIonal Meeting on Improved DTP and DTP-based Com- bmation Vaccines indicated that Venezuela had achieved self-sufficiency in DTP vaccine. 'Total demand of the DTP-producing countries (the total demand of the entire Latm American and Caribbean region is estimated at 90.2 x lob doses). As of 1992, only 7 of the 13 regional laboratories surveyed were producing all three components of DTP vaccine (see Tables 1 and 3). Two others, one in Ar- gentina and one in Uruguay, were pro- ducing diphtheria and tetanus compo- nents and formulating bivalent DT or Td vaccines. These laboratories had sus- pended production of the pertussis com- ponent because of technical problems. One Brazilian laboratory was producing a single component, tetanus toxoid. As noted above, three laboratories with large planned production capacities were not yet operating at the time of the survey. Only Chile and recently Venezuela have reported having sufficient production ca- pacity to meet their own demands. For this reason, almost all the region's op- erating laboratories have plans to expand production. Some countries, such as Bra- zil and Cuba, are currently building mod- ern plants for large-scale manufacture of bacterial vaccines. These facilities, sup- plemented by other planned expansions, would raise present capacity 4.6 times, to a level of 177.5 million doses per year. In the case of Cuba, the vaccine produc- tion plant (which was in the final stages of being set up in September 1993) com- menced production at the end of 1993. This plant has a projected production ca- pacity of roughly 60 million doses of DTP per year. In Brazil, one laboratory re- cently inaugurated a new production in- stallation. In addition, investment in the construction of two other laboratories will raise the country's current production ca- pacity from 3.5 million doses per year to approximately 60 million. These two lat- ter laboratories are scheduled to begin start-up operations in 1994. It is important to point out that all of these new plants are designed to produce Special Reporf 259 ;r 3 e, ii Table 3.

In other words, in addition to the components of DTP vaccine, they can manufacture other bacterial vaccines pro- duced in fermentors. Assuming all goes well, once the new and expanded plants are operating at ca- pacity, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela wilI have the ability to meet not only their own national needs but also the needs of the entire region. It should be noted that the adoption of the acellular pertussis (since it utilizes only a few antigenic components of bacteria) will require a much larger production capac- ity, thus changing the production situa- tion in the region. Current and Projected Capacity to Produce DTP Vaccine and its Components in the Region Table 3 presents figures on the in- stalled capacity and 1992 production of DTP components by the 13 laboratories surveyed. The data shown indicate the diphtheria component was being pro- duced at 51.8% of installed capacity in 1992, within a range for the individual producing laboratories of 20-83%. Simi- larly, the tetanus component was being produced at 67.2% of capacity within a range of 40-lOO%, and the pertussis component was being produced at 61.2% of capacity within a range of 40-94%. (As of 1992 the pertussis component was being manufactured by only seven laboratories, another two having suspended produc- tion of it due to technical problems.) OveralI, total DTP production stood at only 57.3% of the region's installed ca- pacity. These differences between actual out- put and installed capacity appear due to a broad range of technical problems. In some laboratories, for example, there were no technical production backups, while in others the production levels were so low as to suggest inconsistencies in the production process, raising questions about vaccine quality. Formulation of DTP Vaccines Differences were found in the antigen concentrations formulated for DTP vac- cines manufactured at different regional laboratories. The diphtheria component ranged from 7.5 to 30 flocculation units (Lf) per dose; the tetanus component ranged from 2.5 to 20 Lf per dose; and the pertussis component ranged from 8 to 16 optical density units (OU) per dose. While these formulations met the min- imum requirements of the World Health Organization (concentrations ria toxoid ~30 (14), it is nevertheless impor- tant to know the technical and scientific criteria used to define the various antigen concentrations. The antigen concentra- tions in a DTP vaccine should be suffi- cient to ensure that 100% of the lots for- mulated will be able to pass potency tests for each of the antigens in question. The different concentrations of diphtheria and tetanus antigens may indeed be related to use of different potency tests adopted in the region, such as those of WHO and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to the absence of a reference vaccine for use in these tests. Only one laboratory produced 1 ml doses of DTP vaccine; all the others produced 0.5 ml doses. The concentrations of aluminum and thimerosal employed in making these vaccines were found similar in all the lab- oratories visited. Diphtheria Toxoid Production (25) In 1992, the nine laboratories involved produced 919 million Lf units of diph- theria toxoid, as compared to their the- Special Report 261 oretical installed capacity of 1 774 million Lf units per year. The individual outputs of the laboratories ranged from 2 to 340 million Lf units, as compared to an in- stalled capacity of 10 to 800 million Lf units per year. All the laboratories were using the Parke-Williams strain 8 (PW-8) of Coryne- bacterium diphtheriae, but this came from different sources, often without any re- liable record regarding its origin or toxin- producing capacity. There was also a dif- ference in the ways lots were preserved during the production process: three of the laboratories lyophilized the lots while the others froze them. These potential source and preservation variations could partly explain the performance variations observed for diphtheria toxoid produced by different laboratories. Those labora- tories with low production levels might wish to consider employing a C. diphthe- riae strain of known origin with high toxin- producing capacity for the culture method used. All the laboratories visited were using the seed lot concept, but the strains em- ployed could have originated from work- ing lots of the laboratories providing them. Within this context, it is important to underline the need to establish micro- biologic and biochemical control and de- fine other characteristics of the seed strain before it is introduced into the regular production process. Most of the laboratories (seven of them) were still using the static culture method for production of the diphtheria compo- nent, The culture media varied according to whether the static culture or fermentor approach was being used. Production volumes with the static culture method ranged from 20 to 70 1 per operation and yielded an antigen concentration of 70- 120 Lf/ml. The volume of culture medium processed in the fermentor was consid- erably larger (250-700 I), but the concen- tration of the diphtheria antigen pro- 262 Bulletin of PAHO 28(3), 1994 duced by this method was very low (50- 85 Lf!ml) compared with fermentor yields (around 200 Lf/ml) obtained by large pri- vate laboratories. To improve the re- gion's output, measures including the following need to be considered: Using a strain better suited to the deep culture process. Selecting the culture medium and its components so as to produce a large biomass quantity without inhibiting the production of toxin. Effectively managing the conditions and parameters of fermentation pro- cedures-including the geometry of the fermentor, the volume of the cul- ture medium, the degree of agitation and the speed of propeller rotation, the amount of dissolved oxygen in- corporated in the medium, the quan- tity and quality of the antifoaming agent, the quantity and quality of the inoculum, the pH of the medium, and the fermentation time. Differences were also observed in the processes used to separate the biomass from the culture medium. Only two lab- oratories had adopted the closed system, one employing continuous-flow centrif- ugation and the other tangential filtra- tion. Classical centrifuges were used by two others, the remainder using filtra- tion, either by membrane filter presses (in three cases), or gravity filtration through filter paper (in two cases). (In general, it is desirable that closed sys- tems be used for processing the cultures and biomass, as this avoids exposure of the product to the environment and also facilitates fulfillment of GMP standards.) Detoxification was performed in seven of the laboratories after separation of the bacterial mass. One of the other two lab- oratories detoxified the concentrated toxin, while the last detoxified with the cells present. The latter procedure, although much safer, could account for this labo- ratory's relatively low production yieIds. All nine laboratories concentrated their diphtheria toxoid by ultrafiltration, eight using 10 OOO-dalton membranes and one using 30 OOO-dalton membranes. All the laboratories purified their products by precipitation using ammonium sulfate, but some performed only two precipitations while others performed three. A technologic alternative would be to filter the culture, then do the concentra- tion using sterile 30 OOO-dalton ultrafil- ters, and then proceed to detoxify, add- ing an amino acid (glycine or lysine) together with formaldehyde to prevent toxin reversion. The percentage of diphtheria toxoid obtained through these production proc- esses by the different laboratories varied from 25% to 77% of the toxoid originally present in the cultures. The low end of this range (25%) clearly reflected the use of inadequate and obsolete technology at various stages of the production process, since the yield should always exceed 70%. The purity of the toxoid produced ranged from 930 to 1 780 Lf/mg protein nitrogen (PN). Although only three of the nine laboratories' products had the minimum purity of 1 500 Lf/mg PN re- quired by WHO standards (14), the vac- cines prepared with this toxoid were nevertheless released for routine use in vaccination programs. No registers were available for noting the occurrence of diphtheria toxoid reversion. Tetanus Toxoid Production (26) In 1992 a total of 10 laboratories pro- duced 1 818 million Lf units, as com- pared to their theoretical installed capac- ity of 2 704 million Lf units per year. The individual outputs of the laboratories ranged from 9 to 690 million Lf units, as compared to an installed capacity of 12 to 900 million Lf units per year. The same Clostridium fefani strain was used in all the laboratories, although there were differences with respect to its origin and the manner in which it was main- tained. The observations made with re- gard to diphtheria strain procurement and maintenance also apply to the C. tetani used to produce tetanus toxoid. Six laboratories were using the static culture method, with production vol- umes ranging from 40 to 150 1. Four of these laboratories produced yields with relatively low titers (in the range of 40- 60 Lf/ml), whereas the two others ob- tained somewhat better titers (290 Lf/ml). The four other laboratories used fer- mentors processing volumes of culture medium ranging from 300 to 600 1 per operation. The tetanus toxoid titers ob- tained were very low for this procedure, ranging from 40 to 90 Lf/ml. In order to improve the production conditions for this toxin, it will be nec- essary to consider the manufacturing method being used together with a broad range of factors including the following: l The bacterial strain and the method used to maintain the seed lot. l The culture medium and compo- nents used in production; the source of nitrogen, carbon, etc.; and the method of sterilization. l Culture conditions, agitation, pH, temperature, etc. As in the production of diphtheria tox- oid, several methods were used to sep- arate the biomass. Only one laboratory had adopted closed-circuit tangential fil- tration, the most modern methodology and the one that allows the best produc- tion yields. Only two of the laboratories were per- forming detoxification on the concen- Special Report 263 irate; the others were doing this step with the cells present. To curtail losses in the detoxification of tetanus toxoid, it is ad- visable to filter it before placing it in the oven for detoxification; but this would require that the producing laboratory have closed-circuit systems for separating the biomass as a safety precaution. In performing ultrafiltration of the tet- anus toxoid, five of the laboratories used 10 OOO-dalton membranes and five used 30 OOO-dalton membranes. In nine labo- ratories, the final stage of purification was carried out with precipitation using am- monium sulfate and subsequent dialysis. Only one facility performed chromato- graphic purification. A technologic alternative would be to centrifuge or filter the cultures in a closed- circuit system, then provide ultrafiltra- tion with a 30 OOO-dalton membrane to concentrate the toxin, then perform ster- ile filtration, and finally detoxify the product, adding glycine along with for- maldehyde . Overall, the percentage of tetanus tox- oid recovered by means of the existing production processes ranged from 26% at one laboratory to more than 60% (con- sidered the minimum acceptable) at six facilities. The purity of the toxoid ranged from 700 to 2 000 Lf/mg PN per dose; seven laboratories achieved a purity exceeding 1 000 Lf/mg PN per dose, which is the minimum level specified in the WHO re- quirements (14). As in the case of diph- theria toxoid, no registers were available for noting the occurrence of toxoid re- version. Pertussis Vaccine Production (27) In 1992 seven laboratories produced a total of 859 million opacity units (OU) of the pertussis component (versus an in- stalled capacity of 1404 million OU/year). The individual outputs of the seven pro- ducing laboratories ranged from 9 to 375 million OU, relative to an installed ca- pacity of 15 to 600 million OU/year. Several strains of BordeteIla pertussis of varying origins were used. The obser- vations made previously regarding the diphtheria and tetanus strains also apply to these pertussis strains. In cellular vac- cines, the agglutinogens in the strains used must meet the criteria specified by Pres- ton (18); and since these are not easily determined, only strains from laborato- ries that can certify the presence of these surface agglutinogens should be em- ployed. Immediately after the arrival of the strain in the production laboratory, it should be propagated with the fewest possible transfers and made into a ly- ophilized seed lot. It is then desirable to again assay for the presence of agglutin- ogens. In the case of one producing lab- oratory, which was employing a single strain, the need to determine whether this strain possessed all the agglutino- gens required for an effective pertussis vaccine appeared especially critical. The culture media varied, depending on whether the static process or fermen- tors were employed. In the three labo- ratories that used the static method, the volume produced in one operation ranged from 20 to 40.5 1. Although the antigen concentrations obtained were relatively high, ranging from 150 to 400 OU/ml, the use of bottles greatly limited production volume. In the four laboratories utilizing fermentors, the volume of culture me- dium processed in one operation ranged from 30 to 950 1 and the resulting antigen concentrations ranged from 35 to 90 OU/ ml. This last concentration is above av- erage for the fermentor process, and if consistency of this result is confirmed, it would be important that the other labo- ratories using fermentors adopt the same methodology and technology in order to obtain this level of bacterial mass con- centration. 264 Bulletin of PAHO 28(3), 1994 In three of the four laboratories using fermentors, separation of the biomass was accomplished by acid precipitation (using citric acid), a technique that some say increases toxicity. Of all the producing laboratories, only two were employing a closed-circuit system using continuous centrifugation or tangential filtration, the system that should be adopted in order to obtain a better-quality product. Several different detoxification proc- esses were used. Three laboratories used a combination of heat and thimerosal; two others used thimerosal alone; and the re- maining two used formaldehyde. Gen- erally speaking, it is important that the detoxification method used be one that has been validated, that gives reproduc- ible results, that does not increase tox- icity, and that preserves the product's immunizing capacity. Regarding the percentage yield ob- tained from the entire production proc- ess, one laboratory had a yield of only 45%. However, four others had yields exceeding 80%, which may be considered good results. Nevertheless, production of this pertussis component was found to present numerous technical problems for the facilities seeking to manufacture DTP, which is why two of these labora- tories had suspended production of this component at the time of our visit. Formdation of DTP Vaccine According to the WHO requirements, each of these containers should be con- sidered a single lot (thereby creating a very large number of lots) because for- mulation is a complex operation, and each of the several necessary steps entails risk of contamination and adds considerably to the challenge of quality control. Only three of the eight laboratories ac- According to the definitions of the pro- tively formulating DTP vaccine were found ducing laboratories, a total of 157 lots of to have an independent area specifically DTP were produced in 1992, but accord- dedicated to formulation that was also bio- ing to the WHO definition the actual total clean in accordance with GMI' standards was 776. Therefore, instead of perform- (8, 9). (These standards require that entry ing 157 potency tests for the diphtheria to the area be restricted to the personnel component, 157 for the tetanus compo- directly involved in these formulation ac- nent, and 157 for the pertussis compo- tivities, that there be protective barriers, nent, it would have been necessary to that the air be filtered by a High Efficiency conduct 776 tests of each. As all this sug- Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, that positive gests, there is a clear need to employ air pressure be employed, and that the personnel involved wear sterile clothing.) Aluminum phosphate was used as an adjuvant in four of the producing labo- ratories (see Table 4), while the other five used aluminum hydroxide. Four of the latter five imported an aluminum hy- droxide gel from Denmark. The concepts of lot and sublot were interpreted differently by different labo- ratories. Only four were found to use the concept of \"lot\" established for vaccine formulation in the WHO requirements (24), and only three were using the WHO concept of \"sublot.\" According to WHO, all the vaccine components and the adjuvant should be mixed in a single formulation tank. The vaccine should then be homogenized im- mediately and dispensed into sublots. However, most of the producing labo- ratories surveyed did not have formula- tion tanks for large-volume lots. Instead, most of them formulated a \"lot\" in a se- ries of 20-liter or 30-liter containers, add- ing a concentrate of each of the respective components and the adjuvant to each container, and this series of containers was considered a single \"lot.\" Special Report 265 better technologies in the formulation process. Filling of DTP Vaccine Vials Table 4 presents 1992 data on the nine actively producing laboratories' filling in- stallations and systems. Eight (all except one) had an independent area dedicated to filling vaccine vials, although only four of these areas were bio-clean according to GMP standards. Only one laboratory was using a man- ual filling system. All the others had semi- automated or fully automated systems. While the capacity of the equipment ranged from 1 000 to 12 000 vials per hour, the percentage utilization of this capacity varied considerably. This percentage was calculated on the basis of 800 hours per year, a total derived from 4 hours of use a day for 5 days a week and 40 weeks a year). The specific utilization percentages (shown in Table 4) suggest underutiliza- tion of the equipment at some or even most of the laboratories, though the de- gree of underutilization could be changed by plans for expanded output. Most of the laboratories were produc- ing multidose vials, with one lab having a 40-dose presentation. Such a presen- tation is inadequate because its use en- tails a relatively high risk of contamina- tion and wastage. Two laboratories were producing single-dose vials, one of which was sealed in plastic. Installation Conditions at the 13 Planned or Producing Laboratories (19, 20) Storage Rooms various materials and supplies. At four of the 10 operating laboratories the stor- age room was specifically built for that purpose and was well organized. Four of the others had storage rooms that had been adapted for the purpose and were in adequate condition. One laboratory had a storage room that was adapted for the purpose but was inadequate-being too small and not well situated. And finally, one laboratory had no storage room- the supplies, equipment, and materials being scattered about various laboratory spaces and corridors. In sum, eight lab- oratories had storage rooms in good con- dition, whereas two had poor storage ar- rangements. Production Area Of the 10 laboratories operating at the time of the survey, only two had an an- tigen production area that was specifi- cally designed for production and met the GMP requirements (8) (by being bio- clean and having adequate traffic flows and protection barriers). One of the eight remaining laboratories was producing in an area adapted for the purpose where the working conditions were adequate, but the other seven had producing areas adapted for the purpose that did not offer adequate working conditions. Specifi- cally, they were inadequate in terms of traffic flows, the mixing together of ster- ile and contaminated materials, lack of protective barriers, and several other technical problems that would be difficult to overcome. Of the 10 operating labo- ratories visited, five were judged to be in good working condition.

Formulation Area Laborato y Animal Facilities One of the nine producing laboratories was designed with a dedicated vaccine formulation area. One laboratory had adapted its area, which was adequate for the purpose; and another did the same thing but obtained unsatisfactory results. Six of the laboratories did not have a spe- cific area for vaccine formulation, creat- ing a potentially hazardous situation. In two of the laboratories the formulation area was well maintained. The three lab- oratories in the process of being set up had areas that were specifically designed and adequate for formulation. Five of the 10 operating laboratories had a technically adequate animal area built specifically for the purpose. One had an especially designed animal area that was not technically adequate. The re- maining four had animal areas suitably adapted for the purpose, but in two cases these areas were not in adequate condi- tion. Overall, seven of the operating lab- oratories had animal colonies that were well maintained. However, in general there was a serious shortage of laboratory animals, especially of the genetically and microbiologically controlled animals es- sential for quality control testing of vac- cines and their components. Filling Area The filling area in two of the eight ac- Personnel tively producing laboratories with such an area was specifically designed for the purpose, but in one of them the area was inadequate. Two laboratories had areas adapted for this purpose that met the technical requirements, while four others were in the process of adapting filling areas that did not meet all the established requirements. Five of the 10 operating laboratories had well-maintained filling areas, while the three laboratories in the setup stage were being planned with areas specifically designed to serve this pur- pose and meet all specifications. Cold Room In general, the cold rooms (used for stocking supplies, vaccines in bulk, quar- antined products, and released vaccines) were designed specifically for their pur- pose and were well maintained. Only two were not specifically designed to serve the intended purpose; these were very small, were located in unsuitable areas, and were used for stocking a variety of materials. The GMP standards determine that an institution dedicated to vaccine produc- tion must have a health unit for moni- toring the staff's health conditions. AS indicated in Table 5, all but two of the laboratories had a specific health pro- gram for the staff. In general, they used a routine medical service provided for the entire institute. Technical training was provided regu- larly and routinely at all but two of the laboratories visited. Training in biosafety (21) was provided at eight. Only one lab- oratory reported that it had never pro- vided a course in GMP for its production staff. In some cases, however, the knowl- edge provided by the training was not being effectively utilized. For example, in several of the laboratories offering courses in GMP, the GMP standards were not being applied. This demonstrates the need to change the attitudes of laboratory per- sonnel in order to have them apply their knowledge to concrete situations. The number of staff members assigned to the production area of a given Iabo- ratory tended to depend on the com- 268 Bulletin of PAHO 28(3), 1994 Table 5.

As noted above, some laborato- ries were manufacturing a single com- ponent, others two components, and others complete DTP vaccine as well as several other vaccines for human use. As Table 5 indicates, those laboratories that were still organizing for DTP production had already assigned staff members for this purpose; overall, three laboratories had 15 to 20 people assigned to produc- tion; three others had 44 to 82; and seven had 100 to 197. Seven laboratories had a research and development section, the number of staff members assigned to this section's activ- ity ranging from 2 to 176. However, only a few of the laboratories had specific vac- cine research and development projects, mainly because each of the laboratory fa- cilities was attached to a national institute or agency with responsibilities in all areas of health. Quality Control Table 5 also shows that the 12 labora- tories exercising quality control assigned anywhere from 3 to 50 staff members to this task. Indeed, one laboratory (which indicated no technical or biosafety train- ing) reported having more personnel as- signed to quality control than to produc- tion. In general, it appears that the number of staff members assigned may be af- fected by the manner in which quality control is carried out and also by other functions of the staff members at the in- stitution responsible for the laboratory, since the institutions involved carry out other public health activities. Of the nine operating laboratories that provided data on quality control activi- ties, only four were found to exercise in- ternal quality control outside the pro- duction area, as recommended by the international standards and WHO re- quirements (22, 23). At these nine labo- ratories, the production staff also per- formed the quality control tests. Although none of these tests for controlling the production process (e.g., testing of pH or application of the Gram stain for a microscopic test of purity) could be elim- mated because of pressure to reach a quick decision, final responsibility for the qual- ity of the intermediary and final products rested with the internal quality control staff of the production laboratory. With regard to quality standards fol- lowed, eight of the nine laboratories re- ported following either the WHO re- quirements, standards of other countries, standards of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or standards of the Pkar- macopoeia Europeia . Only one laboratory said it simply followed its own country's national standards. Only two laboratories applied quality control to all the inputs used in the pro- duction process. Four other laboratories exercised partial control over these inputs. In six of the nine operating laboratories that provided data on quality control ac- tivities, documentation of a given vaccine lot was being kept in a single file. In contrast, at the remaining three labora- tories the file records were incomplete or were found scattered in different places. Of the three new laboratories in the process of being set up, two had already established internal quality control at the time of the survey-in order to imple- ment quality control in the design of pro- duction parameters. However, in one of the production laboratories there was no internal quality control or control of in- termediate products, while testing of the final product was done by the country's National Quality Control Laboratory. Also, of the nine countries listed in Table 1, three had no national quality control lab- oratory. Only one of the laboratories vis- ited was found to systematically perform external reference quality control of DTP vaccine. 270 Bulletin of PAHO 28(3), 1994 It is important to emphasize that the manufacturer's responsibility does not end with production and distribution of the vaccine. The manufacturer is responsible for any problems that may occur in con- nection with utilization of a poor quality, low potency, or contaminated vaccine, as well as for any adverse reactions that may occur in response to inappropriate vac- cines. It is thus essential that the pro- duction process meet the required stand- ards in order to ensure the quality of the final product. CONCLUSIONS The long tradition of vaccine produc- tion in the region is an integral part of the area's historic public health devel- opment, a development paralleling that of the more industrialized nations. How- ever, in recent years only Chile's Na- tional Institute of Public Health has con- sistently produced enough DTP vaccine to meet national demand, though infor- mation presented in 1993 indicated that Venezuela's \"Rafael Rangel\" National In- stitute of Health had also achieved a pro- duction level consonant with national self- sufficiency. It is encouraging to note that the lab- oratories in Brazil, Cuba, and Mexico are receiving large government investments and making effective strides toward es- tablishment of modern plants specifically designed for human vaccine production that wilI satisfy all the technical require- ments set forth by prevailing interna- tional standards and WHO. At the same time, some of the currently operating lab- oratories making DTP or its components are considering how they might modern- ize their facilities, while others are in need of finding ways to overcome pronounced problems affecting current production ac- tivities. Within this context, whatever the precise goals involved, the following are some of the matters that need to be con- sidered by all laboratories desiring to change the present situation: (1) Since virtually all the vaccine pro- duction laboratories of the region are directly or indirectly dependent on the State, all of these laborato- ries should demand that their re- spective governments make a po- litical commitment to support their work. Such a commitment should be accompanied by a broad overall plan that includes short-, medium-, and long-term planning; targets specific products; and provides for the investment needed to attain the proposed goals. Governments in some of the vaccine-producing countries have already made political commit- ments along these lines, and a few have established programs directed at achieving national self-suffi- ciency in production of essential vaccines-programs with short- and medium-term plans for moderniz- ing production and maintaining ef- fective quality control laboratories. (2) Each country engaged in vaccine production should establish a Na- tional Control Authority with reg- ulatory functions such as product registration and laboratory licens- ing, and if possible should possess or create a National Quality Con- trol Laboratory. If the latter is not feasible because of insufficient funding or because very few lots are used, the National Control Au- thority should establish alternate ways of testing vaccines before they are released for use. (Development and use of a quality control labo- ratory network is a valid alternative for countries that have not yet or- ganized a quality control system.) (3) It is worrisome that some operating vaccine laboratories actually do not Special Rep-f 271 have internal control mechanisms. Such mechanisms constitute an es- sential part of any vaccine produc- tion scheme and should be estab- lished as soon as possible in any producing laboratory not having them in place. In addition, quality assurance activities, together with biosafety and GMP standards, should be effectively incorporated into the regular laboratory routine. (4) Most of the institutions engaged in vaccine manufacture in the region do not have the organizational, administrative, or managerial char- acteristics needed to ensure eco- nomically and financially self-sus- taining production of biologicals. To begin with, only three of the 13 lab- oratories surveyed had an appro- priate administrative structure en- compassing the study of cost-benefit aspects of their various production activities. In addition, the production activ- ity in a vaccine laboratory requires a special organizational support structure, as follows: (a) An administrative unit with managerial mechanisms that are flexible and permit quick decision- making. It is essential to have spe- cific sections assigned to deal with personnel matters, the manage- ment of expendable materials and supplies, finances, and various other concerns depending on each labo- ratory's level of complexity. Among other things, it is very important for each laboratory to establish a personnel policy that offers wages both compatible and competitive with the private sector in order to attract, encourage, and motivate new talent. (b) An internal quality control unit and quality assurance system that is independent of production op- erations and technically capable of providing professional advisory services to the production unit. (c) A technical unit to maintain the highly specialized equipment that is usually found in the pro- duction area. (d) A technologic development unit capable of supporting both the production and quality control ac- tivities. (5) As suggested above, like those en- gaged in any productive activity, it is important for vaccine-producing institutions to study cost-benefit re- lationships and the economic via- bility of their work. The informa- tion gained from studies of this type can serve to correct or define the course of the activity. In general, the production activ- ity should be self-sustaining and capable not only of recovering the cost of operations and the invest- ments made, but also of using the income generated to regularly up- date its installations and equip- ment and to invest in research and development. Thus, it is a sine qua non for laboratories that plan to ex- pand their operations or invest in new installations to carry out this type of study, as well as others, in order to assess the quality of the technology they are going to use, the equipment to be selected, the technical support requirements of the equipment, the availability of locally produced or imported sup- plies and raw materials, the nature of the vaccine product market, etc. (6) Today shared production is quite routine among private laboratories. The idea is to make the most of each facility's technical capabilities in a given area and to seek out com- plementary capabilities at other laboratories in order to make all the 272 Bulletin of PAHO 28(3), 1994 VI (8) (9) activities more effective. In Latin America and the Caribbean there are laboratories that produce only one or two DTI' components; shared production would seem the most logical option for dealing with this situation. In order to implement item 6 above, it is important to establish a system for certifying laboratories that have adequate technologic conditions for vaccine production; in this way, a laboratory obtaining a vaccine com- ponent from another laboratory that is certified will be able to expect that the product will possess ade- quate quality. Although laboratories in the region are receptive to the idea of exchang- ing information, this option is not being fully explored. Hence, it is im- portant to find ways of strengthen- ing technical exchanges-including exchanges of experiences, produc- tion strains, training activities, methodologies, etc. To judge from the intense techno- logic development taking place at several vaccine laboratories in the developed countries, it can be as- sumed that new and better vac- cines will be appearing in the very near future. The process for man- ufacturing these vaccines will also be more technologically complex. Therefore, laboratories wishing to participate in this new technologic \"revolution\" will need to have the technical and scientific capacity to in- corporate the new technologies re- quired. Among other things, they should have installations and equip- ment that meet the international GMP standards and WHO require- ments for existing technologies, as well as appropriate specialized hu- man resources. In addition, since projects taking advantage of the new technologies will be complex and will generally need substantial time to mature, it can be expected that an enormous financial investment will be needed. Considering all this, it seems both appropriate and important to orga- nize a regional strategic plan for de- velopment and production of im- proved DTP vaccine and other DTP vaccine combinations. Such a plan should make provisions for various types of technical cooperation, de- velopment and sharing of produc- tion, and selection criteria for par- ticipating laboratories.
