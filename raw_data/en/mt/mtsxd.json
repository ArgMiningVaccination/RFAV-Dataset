Histocompatibility laboratory member s 4. Medic al/scientific member s 5. Public o rganization member s 6. Individual member s Business member s do not have voting privileges in the OPTN. OPTN member s designated Member s Not in Good Standing do not have voting or other membership privileges. However, member s designated Members Not in Good Standing must continue to fulfill their OPTN member responsibilities. The table below summarizes the voting privileges for each OPTN membership type: Membership Type Number of Votes Additional Requireme nts to Qualify for Voting Privileges Transplant h ospital One per transplant hospital The transplant hospital must have current approval as a designated transplant program for at least one organ. OPO One per OPO The OPO must be independent, or a hospital -based OPO that is able to demonstrate all of the qualifications according to Section 1.3 .C Histocompatibility laboratory One per histocompatibility laboratory The histocompatibility laboratory must be independent, according to Section 1.4.

When a quorum is achieved, majority vote of member s may transact any business at the meeting, except when dif ferent voting requirements are defined in these Bylaws. A member or member e lector may only vote once on each resolution. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article I: Membership Effective Date: 7/27/2023 Page 3 C. Meetings Members have an annual meeting to elect a Board of Directors and officers, and to address other OPTN matters. The annual meeting of member s may be held in conjunction with a Board of Directors meeting. A member or member e lector who signs a waiver of notice will be exempt from the requirement of written notice. A member or member elector who attends a meeting is assumed to have received timely and proper notice of the meeting unless the member or member e lector attends only to object that the meeting is not lawfully convened. A notice sent to a member or member elector who is not eligible t o vote does not imply that the member or member elector may vote. The OPTN will not pay or reimburse a member 's cost to attend meetings of OPTN member s. Special Meetings Special meetings of the member s may be called at any time by the president , Executive Director, a majority of the Board of Directors, or by written request of a majority of voting members and member e lectors. Notice of a special meeting must state the time, place, and purpose of the meeting and be provided to each m ember not more than 60 days or fewer than 25 day s before the proposed date of the meeting. Closed Sessions of Meetings Meetings of the OPTN membership are usually open to the public. However, closed sessions may be held for discussions involving confidential matters which may include OPTN membership approval, credentials, monitoring, or disciplinary matters as defined in the OPTN contract. Matters involving individuals where an open meeting would clearly compromise their privacy will also be reviewed in closed sessio ns. Representatives from the Federal Government serving on the Board of Directors, or their chosen representatives, are not excluded from closed sessions of OPTN meetings. D. Expenses If the OPTN Contractor incurs any expenses on behalf of a member by providing organ transplantation assistance to the member , the member must reimburse the OPTN Contractor in full. Examples of expenses include, but are not limited to: Courier transport of an organ. Commercial airline or private aircraft for transporting an organ. Repackaging of organs or tissue. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article I: Membership Effective Date: 7/27/2023 Page 4 Transplant hospital, OPO, or histocompatibility laboratory member s must pay all OPTN fees, charges, or other financial obligation within 30 days to the OPTN Contractor or be considered in violation of OPTN member ship requirements. E. Member Compliance By ac cepting membership in the OPTN, each member agrees to comply with all OPTN Obligations, which include all of the following: 1. Applicable provisions of the: a. National Organ Transplant Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 273 et seq. b. OPTN Final Rule, 42 CFR Part 121 c. OPTN Bylaws d. OPTN Policies 2. Acting to avoid risks to patient health or public safety 3. Fulfilling all requests for information Signatures necessary to meet OPTN Obligations may be handwritten or electronically produced, including digital or electronically imaged signatures. F. Member Reviews and Evaluations The OPTN will conduct ongoing periodic reviews and evaluations of each transplant hospital, histocompatibility, and OPO member for compliance with OPTN Obligations. All compliance monitoring is performed using guidelines developed by the OPTN Contractor. G. Reporting Potential Noncompliance with OPTN Obligations Any member who becomes aware of a potential noncompliance of OPTN Obligations must inform the OPTN as soon as the member becomes aware of the issue, including potential noncompliance by the membe r itself. All incidences of potential noncompliance are referred for further review as outlined in these Bylaws. Any member who fails to comply with OPTN Obligations may be subject to actions as set forth in these Bylaws. H. Affiliated Organizations The OPTN Bylaws do not in any way require an OPTN member to: 1. Become a member of any organization that is a parent, sponsor, contractor, or affiliated organization of the OPTN. 2. Comply with bylaws of any parent, sponsor, contractor, or affiliated organizati on of the OPTN. 3. Assume any corporate duties or obligations of any parent, sponsor, contractor, or affiliated organization of the OPTN. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article I: Membership Effective Date: 7/27/2023 Page 5 I. Removal of Members Transplant hospital members who no longer qualify as an OPTN member will be reviewed according to Appendix L: Reviews and Actions. All other OPTN members who no longer qualify for OPTN membership may be removed as members t hrough any of the following procedures: The member itself may request to voluntarily withdraw from OPTN membership by forwarding a written request to the Executive Director. The OPTN may notify the member in writing that, unless the member demonstrates within 60 days of notification that it continues to meet applicable membership criteria, the member's OPTN membership will be terminated, even if the member does not request removal. If, within 60 days of notification, the member demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the OPTN, that the member meets OPTN membership requirements, the OPTN will withdraw its notice of termination. If the member fails to demonstrate that it continues to meet OPTN membership requirements, its membership in the OPTN will terminate on the 60th day after notification of termination by the OPTN. The member can appeal this decision to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In the event a member exercises this right of appeal, the member will notify the OPTN Contractor of this by any method that can be tracked and provides proof of receipt, such as: Commercial overnight delivery service Secure electronic communication Registered or certified mail, return receipt requested Pending a decision on the appeal, the removal process will continue unless the Secretary of HHS directs otherwise. If the appeal is denied, the process will be continued or reinitiated, as applicable. Any other decision by the Secretary of HHS will be submitted to the Membership and Professional Standards Committee (MPSC) or Board of Directors to act on the Secretary's decision. Any member removed from OPTN membership for any reason may later reapply for membership. The Board of Directors will periodically review these requirements and update these Bylaws with additional membership requirements for members. Failure to fulfill such requirements will be cause for any corrective action described in Appendix L: Reviews and Actions.

Actions without a Meeting The Board may take action without a convened meeting if there is unanimous written consent of all voting Directors. In order for actions to be taken without a meeting, all Directors must vote on the action and the vote must be unanimous. 2.7 Conflicts of Interest s It is the OPTN policy that all Directors avoid conflicts of interest s and the appearance of conflicts of interests. It is recognized that all Directors are directly or indirectly involved in organ donation, procurement and transplantation, and that the OPTN benefits from their collective expertise and experience in the development and implementation of OPTN policies. However, issues that involve certain institutions or individuals may involve conflicts of interest s. Upon commencement of service on the Board, annuall y, prior to every meeting of the Board, and at any intervening instance in which a potential conflict arises, Directors must disclose employment or activities that might provide personal or financial gain related to the outcomes of matters affecting the OP TN and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article II: Board of Directors Effective Date: 7/27/2023 Page 18 to act as required to avoid a conflict or the appearance of a conflict of interests. If a Director believes that another Director has an undisclosed conflict of interests, the Director must notify the President of the Board. Avoiding conflicts of interests or the appearance of conflicts of interest s may require that a Director abstain from voting on a matter or leave the room during discussion of the matter after providing relevant information to the Board. Prior to each Board meeting, the President will notify Directors that have a conflict of interests with issues to be discussed at the meeting, and will advise the Director how to avoid the conflict or the appearance of a conflict. 2.7.1: Disputed Conflicts of Interests Before the Board considers an issue around which a Director disputes whether a conflict of interests exists, the Executive Committee will convene in closed session. The Director whose potential conflict is in dispute will explain why the Director does not agree there is a conflict o r does not agree with the way in which the conflict has been proposed to be avoided. A Director alleging another Director has a conflict will also have an opportunity to explain that position. The Executive Committee will then vote on whether there is a co nflict of interests or the appearance of a conflict, and if so, how the Executive Committee believes the conflict should be avoided. If the Executive Committee believes the conflict of interests is so significant that the only way to avoid the conflict or the appearance of the conflict is to prevent the Director from continuing to serve on the Board, then the Board may consider removing the Director according to Article 2.5: Removals . 2.8 Relationship of the OPTN Board and the OPTN Contractor's Board When the OPTN contract requires it, the OPTN Board of Directors will be elected in parallel with and using the same procedures as the OPTN Contractor's Board of Directors, resulting in identical memberships. This enables the OPTN Contractor to perform tasks required by the OPTN contract under the authority of the OPTN Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will convene as the OPTN Board to conduct OPTN business and the OPTN Contractor Board to conduct OPTN Contractor business. Activi ties of the Board of Directors, while acting as the OPTN Board, will be limited only to activities and business of the OPTN. To accomplish this, separate agendas or sections within a combined agenda will identify if an item is OPTN business or OPTN Contrac tor business. Consistent with this process, OPTN Committees are appointed in parallel with OPTN Contractor Committees and operate under these same procedures.

Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article VII: Permanent Standing Committees Effective Date: 0727/2023 Page 27 Article VII: Permanent Standing Committees The OPTN will have the following permanent standing Committees: Ethics Heart Transplantation Histocompatibility Kidney Transplantation Liver and Intestinal Organ Transplantation Living Donor Lung Transplantation Membership and Professional Standards Minority Affairs Operations and Safety Organ Procurement Organization Pancreas Transplantation Patient Affairs Pediatric Tran splantation Policy Oversight Committee Transplant Administrators Transplant Coordinators The Committees are advisory to the Board of Directors, which makes the final decisions of the OPTN. The standing Committees will provide initial review and analysis of proposed policies and initiatives based on their collective expertise and unique perspectives, and present their recommendations to the Board of Directors. Committees may also be advisory to each other when Committee interest and expertise overlap. W hen Committees evaluate proposals jointly, they should present to the Board of Directors either a common recommendation or a report that summarizes the continued disagreement. Committees may have additional responsibilities as defined by the OPTN Bylaws a nd Policies. Committees' role in developing policies and standards is further defined in Article XI: Adoption of Policies of these Bylaws. 7.1 Composition of Standing Committees Each standing Committee must be represented by each of the OPTN geographic regions. For more information about the OPTN regions, see Article IX: Regions of these Bylaws. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Article VII: Permanent Standing Committees Effective Date: 7/27/2023 Page 28 All standing Committees should have at least one representative from each region as well as representatives from the following: Transplant hospitals OPOs Transplant coordinators Transplant candidates, recipients, donors, or their family members The Histocompatibility Committee should have at least one histocompatibility laboratory representative from each region . The vice president, as incoming president , will appoint representatives to the Committees from a list of nominations received from the regional councillors. Committees will, to the extent practical, include racial and gender representation reflec ting the diversity of those served by the OPTN. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Project Officer for the OPTN contract and the Director of the Division of Transplantation, or representatives they designate, serve ex-officio and do n ot have a vote on the Committees. Committee members are usually appointed to only one standing Committee at a time, but the vice president may appoint member s to multiple Committees to enhance communication between Committees, or for any reason that may increase knowledge and productivity of the Committees. 7.2 Permanent Standing Committee Chairs and Vice Chairs Committee Chairs inform the OPTN president and the Executive Director of the activities of their Committees and report to the Board of Directors upon request. The treasurer of the OPTN serves as the Chair of the Finance Committee. The vice president, with approval of the Board of Directors, appoints the Chair of the other permanent standing Committees. Chairs and Vice Chairs of the permanent standing Committees have the following terms: The Patient Affairs, Ethics and Transplant Administrator Chairs and Vice Chairs serve three year terms. Other Chairs and Vice Chairs serve two year terms. Chairs will serve an additional 1 -year term as an ex-officio member of the Committee. The vice pres ident may appoint one or more Committee Chairs for a one -year term so that a staggered rotation is achieved. Committee Chairs may be appointed to consecutive terms. The president will Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Article VII: Permanent Standing Committees Effective Date: 7/27/2023 Page 29 appoint the replacement for any Chairs or Vice Chairs who cannot complete their full term for any reason. 7.3 Terms of Permanent Standing Committee Members The vice president appoints members of the Committees for terms of three years, except for Membership and Professional Standards Committee (MPSC) members , who serve two -year terms. When appointing permanent standing Committee members, the vice president may also: Appoint up to one -third of the members of a Committee to a one -year term to achieve a staggered rotation. Appoint any Committee member to an additional full or partial term whose expertise is needed for the committee to continue its work. The president will appoint the replacement for any Committee members who cannot complete their full term for any reason. Committee terms begin on July 1. 7.4 Meetings Permanent standing Committees will meet as necessary to carry out projects approved by the Board of Directors. Committee meetings are typically open to the public. However, the Committees will hold closed sessions for discussions involving confidential matters including OPTN membership approval, credentials, monitoring, or disciplinary matters as defined in the OPTN contract. Matters involving individuals where an open meeting would clearly compromise their privacy will also be reviewed in closed sessions. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Project Officer for the OPTN contract and the Director of the Division of Transplantation, or representatives they designate, may attend all closed sessions of OPTN meetings. 7.5 The Policy Oversight Committee (POC) The OPTN will have a permanent standing committee, the Policy Oversight Committee (POC), that will be advisory to the Board of Directors. The POC will provide written recommendations about policies to the Board of Directors at least twice a year. A. Composition of POC The POC will be comprised of the Vice Chairs of each of the Committees, or a representative of each Committee appointed by the vice president, and other individuals as needed. B. Ex-officio Representation The Policy Oversight Committee will also have non -voting, ex-officio members from the Division of Transplantation of the HHS and the SRTR, or representatives they designate, as follows : Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Article VII: Permanent Standing Committees Effective Date: 7/27/2023 Page 30 1. The U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Project Officer for the OPTN contract. 2. The Director of the Division of Transplantation. 3. One other Federal representative to be designated by the OPTN Project Officer. 4. The Project Officer of the SRTR contract. 5. Two ex-officio, non -voting representatives of the SRTR, chosen by the SRTR. C. Terms of POC Members All POC members, except the Chair or Vice Chair, serve for terms equal to the term they are serving on the Committee they are representing. POC terms begin on July 1. 7.6 Finance Committee In addition to the permanent standing committees listed above, the OPTN will have a Finance Committee to assist in the governance of the OPTN. The Finance Committee will report to the Board. The Finance Committee will have memb ers, composition, terms, and duties, as may be determined by the President in consultation with the Board of Directors. The President may appoint any number of non -voting Advisors to the Finance Committee subject to approval by the Board of Directors for t erms the President may deem appropriate. 7.7 Conflicts of Interest s All OPTN Committee members must avoid conflicts of interests and the appearance of conflicts of interests. Committee members will be held to the standard for conflicts of interest s as described in Article 2.7: Conflicts of Interest s of these Bylaws. Prior to each Committee meeting, the Chair of the Committee will notify committee members that have a conflict of interests with issues to be discussed at the meeting, and will advise the committee member how to avoid the conflict or the appearance of a conflict. If the committee member disagrees, the committee member can appeal to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will deal with the disputed conflict of interests according to Article 2.7.1: Disputed Conflicts of Interests of these Bylaws. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article VIII: Financial Considerations Effective Date: 0727/2023 Page 31 Article VIII: Financial Considerations 8.1 Fiscal Year The fiscal year of the OPTN will begin on October 1 and end on the following September 30. 8.2 Reserve Fund The OPTN Board of Directors will establish and maintain a Primary Account and a Reserve Account as described in th e OPTN Contract. The Reserve Account will be available to pay allowable OPTN operating costs consistent with the terms of the OPTN Contract in the event of insufficient funds in the Primary Account. The Reserve Account will also be available for OPTN prog ram activities identified by the OPTN Board of Directors as critical to the OPTN, but that could not be implemented with available Primary Account funds. A. Reserve Fund Creation and Purpose The Reserve Account is funded by a designated amount from OPTN registration fees. The Finance Committee will regularly assess the Reserve Account, and make recommendations to the Board of Directors on the amount of the Reserve Account and the designation o f OPTN registration fees to be directed toward reserve funding. The Board of Directors may authorize additional transfers from the Primary Account to the Reserve Account at any time. If reserve funds are used due to insufficient funds in the Primary Account, the reserve funds will be replenished from the Primary Account as funds become available. B. Reserve Account Funds The Reserve Account will be fully funded when it contains funds equal to three months of average budget operating expenses based on the then -current fiscal year. Reserves may be held in several accounts with multiple financial institutions, and may contain cash or other short term investments. C. Use of Reserve Account Funds and Notification 1. The Board will approve a revenue estimate for each fiscal year based on the projected number of registrations, the amount of the registration fee, and the amount of any federal appropriated funds. 2. In the event of a funding shortfall, funds may be withdrawn from the Reserve Account if two conditions are met: a. A revenue shortfall equal to at least 3 percent of OPTN revenue for a fiscal year is projected to occur. The Executive Director will report to the Board the reason for the projected shortfall and the new revenue estimate for the fiscal year b. The amount of funds in the Primary Account is less than or equal to one month of average operating expenditures If both cond itions are met, the Executive Director may transfer the lesser of one- half of the amount of the projected shortfall or one -half of the amount of the balance of the Reserve Account to the Primary Account. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Article VIII: Financial Considerations Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 32 At least 72 hours prior to any transfer from the R eserve Account, the Executive Director will provide written notification to the Board of Directors of the planned transfer. 3. Funds may also be withdrawn from the Reserve Account if the HRSA Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and the Executive Director, with approval by the OPTN Executive Committee, mutually agree in writing to the transfer of funds. Organ Procurement and Transplant ation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article IX: Regions Effective Date: 0727/2023 Page 33 Article IX: Regions 9.1 Structure There are 11 OPTN geographic regions in the United States. The OPTN regions provide a platform for sharing ideas and information about organ procurement and transplantation in a smaller forum. OPTN member s belong to the region where their principal office or residence is located. The region s are: Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Eastern Vermont Region 2: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and the part of Northern Virginia in the Donation Service Area served by the Washington Regional Transplant Community (DCTC) OPO. Region 3: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Puerto Rico Region 4: Oklahoma and Texas Region 5: Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah Region 6: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington Region 7: Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin Region 8: Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Wyoming Region 9: New York and Western Vermont Region 10: Indiana, Michigan and Ohio Region 11: Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia 9.2 Meetings Each region holds at least two meetings per year. The purpose of these meetings is to: Exchange information. Discuss and comment on issues distributed for public comment during the OPTN policy development process. Nominate regional councillors and Associate regional councillors . Address any matters of interest to the region . Proposals developed at regional meetings are sent to the national Committees for consideration. The Committees, which include representatives from each region , then present the proposals to the Board of Directors for approval or rejection. 9.3 Regional Voting Privileges Members and member electors with voting privileges who reside in a region will have one vote on each OPTN regional matter, including the election of councillor and associate councillor. Transplant hospital, OPO, histocompatibility, medical/scientific, and public organization member representatives will belong Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article IX: Regions Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 34 to a region according to the location of the member's principal offices. Any individual who is currently serving on an OPTN Committee and who is not employed by or on the medical staff of a transplant hospital, histocompatibility laboratory, OPO, medical/scientific or public organization member will also have regional voting privileges. 9.4 Regional Elections Members, member electors, and individuals with voting privileges in each region will elect a regional councillor and an associate councilor, using one slate for councillor and a second slate for associate councillor. Unless otherwise determined by the regi on, the subsequent elections will include only a slate for a new associate councillor, with the current associate councillor automatically becoming the councillor. A. Regional Councillor Election The regional councillor serves as the region's representative on the Board of Directors. The councillor from each region is responsible, along with the president and the Executive Director, for coordinating regional activities to transact the business of the OPTN. The regional councillor is elected according to A rticle 2.2.B: El ection of Regional Councillors . B. Associate Councillor Election Each region determines the guidelines for electing associate councillors. The associate councillor serves on the MPSC for a two -year term that begins July 1 following the regional election. Associate councillors cannot serve consecutive terms, except when appointed by the OPTN vice president to fill an associate councillor vacancy. If the associate councillor is appointed to fill a portion of another associate councillor's term due to a vacancy, then the associate councillor will be eligible for one succeeding two -year term as associate councillor. Associate councilors must reside in or be employed in the region they represent at all times during their term. 9.5 Review Boards The OPTN establishes review boards to review requests for exceptions that are permitted by Policy. These review boards provide confidential medical peer review of transplant candidates placed on the waiting list at a more urgent status than the standard listing criteria justifies. As part of these reviews, review boards may perform the following tasks: Review justification forms submitted by the transplant hospital that document the candidate's current condition and decide if the requested status is appropriate. Refer transplant hospitals to the appropriate OPTN Committee for review of candidates listed and transplanted at an inappropriate status. The Committee may then, if necessary, refer the hospital to the Membership and Professional Standards Committee (MPSC). Serv e other peer review functions as determined by the Board of Directors. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article IX: Regions Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 35 Review boards are formed under the direction of the Committees and Board of Directors. R eview boards can operate and perform peer review functions as determined by the Board of Direct ors. The Board of Directors and Committees may establish other guidelines for Review Board organization and function as necessary. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article X: Amendment of Charter and Bylaws Effective Date: 0727/2023 Page 36 Article X: Amendment of Charter and Bylaws 10.1 Voting Requirements The Board of Directors can amend the Charter or Bylaws with a majority vote of all Directors. An amendment passed by the Board of Directors is in effect until the next annual meeting of member s. Every amendmen t to the Charter or Bylaws approved by the Board of Directors must be confirmed by a majority vote of a quorum of member s present at the annual meeting. If the amendment is not confirmed at the annual meeting, the amendment is repealed, effective from the date of the annual meeting. 10.2 Notice Each Director must receive notice of any meeting where there will be a proposal to amend the Charter or Bylaws. The notice will be sent to the address on file with the Executive Director, or by any method that, in the opinion of the Executive Director, gives adequate notice to the Directors. Notices for meetings must be sent no more than 60 days or no fewer than 10 days before the date of the meeting. The proposed amendment must be provided with the meeting notice. 10.3 Non- substantive Changes to Bylaws The OPTN Contractor may correct any of the following: Capitalization or punctuation, as needed to maintain consistency with current policy Typographical, spelling, or grammatical errors Lettering and numbering of a rule or the subparts of a rule, according to style conventions in current policy Cross -references to rules or sections that are cited incorrectly because of subsequent repeal, amendment, or reorganization of the sections cited The Executive Committee will retrospectively review any of these changes made to policy by the OPTN Contracto r. The OPTN Contractor may not make any substantive changes to policy without approval of the Board of Directors. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Article XI: Adoption of Policies Effective Date: 0727/2023 Page 37 Article XI: Adoption of Policies The OPTN Policies and OPTN Bylaws are the policy documents that govern the allocation, procurement, transportation and transplantation of d onated organs. The Board of Directors is responsible for approving and implementing policies that reflect the mission of the OPTN. The Board fulfills this responsibility with input from the OPTN membership and other interested individuals. The OPTN policy development process includes these main steps: 1. Issues are presented to one or more Committees for consideration. 2. The Committee creates a policy proposal. 3. The proposal is distributed to the public, including members of the transplant community, for review and comment. 4. The Committee considers and responds to comments, and then develops a final policy proposal. 5. The final proposal is sent to the Board of Directors for a vote. The Board of Directors may adopt, amend and adopt, or reject the proposal. The Board may also return the proposal to the Committee for further deliberation. 6. The OPTN Contractor provides notice to the transplant community that the Board of Directors has approved changes to OPTN policy, and takes the necessary steps to implement the changes. 7. Once the policy has been adopted and implemented, it is periodically evaluated for its impact and effectiveness. 11.1 Creating and Submitting Policy Proposals Committees develop proposals for new policies or changes to existing policies and submit them to the Board of Directors for consideration. Committees developing proposals may also request review and comment from one or more additional Committees if necessary. For more information about OPTN Committees, see Article VII: Permanent Standing Committees of these Bylaws. Committees analyze policy proposals using select data to measure the effect of the proposal on the transplant community. The analysis includes baseline data that reflects how current policy is performing as well as projected outcomes to estimate the impact of the policy proposal. Data, analysis, and other information requested by the Committees are provided by the OPTN Contractor and Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) contractor, as specified in their contracts with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Policy proposals include a summary that provides background information to explain the purpose of the proposal and the issues that were considered in developing the proposal. A. The Public Comment Period The public, including the transplant community, is usually included in the OPTN policy development process through the public comment process. Proposals to change organ Organ Procurement and Transplantation Networ k (OPTN) Bylaws Article XI: Adoption of Policies Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 38 allocation or membership requirements require public comment. However, some policy proposals do not require public comment, including: Proposals that clarify or correct existing policy rather than changing the intent or adding to the policy. Proposals that reflect administrative or non- substantive procedural changes that do not change the intent of the policy or do not impact the operations of the transplant community. The public comment period is usually 45 days. Proposals issued for public comment are distributed in the following ways: 1. Posted to the OPTN website or mailed to a ll OPTN member s and anyone who requests to be placed on the list . 2. Provided at regional meetings of the member s. 3. Provided at meetings of interested Committees. Comments received during the public comment period will be reviewed and addressed by the sponsoring Committee. Comments received after the end of the set public comment period may be reviewed and addressed at the discretion of the Chair of the sponsoring C ommittee. Based on the comments received, the Committee may make modifications to the proposal, including withdrawal of the proposal. Should the Committee choose to recommend the policy proposal to the Board, the proposal will be updated to include the public comments and the Committee's responses and then presented to the Board of Directors as a final proposal. B. Mandatory and Non- mandatory Policies In developing policy proposals, the sponsoring Committee d etermines if the policy should be one of the following: Mandatory, or designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a federal regulation defined by the OPTN Final Rule according to the requirements of Section 1138 of the Social Securit y Act. Non -mandatory, but binding as required by the OPTN Bylaws and agreed to by all OPTN member s in the membership contract. The OPTN Final Rule, section 121.11(b)(2) makes submission of data to the OPTN by OPO and transplant hospital members mandatory , and failure to submit the required data is considered by HRSA to be a violation of OPTN membership requirements. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Networ k (OPTN) Bylaws Article XI: Adoption of Policies Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 39 The sponsoring Committee can recommend that a policy be made mandatory, and the Board of Directors must support the recommendation. The poli cy must then be presented to the Secretary of HHS for approval as mandatory policy. Recommendations from the Board to make a policy mandatory must be approved by the Secretary of HHS or the policy remains non - mandatory. No OPTN policy will be subject to enforcement as specified in section 1138 of the Social Security Act until approved by the Secretary of HHS. Compliance with OPTN policies determined to be non-mandatory will be monitored by the OPTN according to these Bylaws. Policies recommended for ado ption into HHS regulation might include those necessary for the administration of other programs related to organ procurement and transplantation in the Department of HHS. The Secretary may solicit guidance from the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation in accordance with the OPTN Final Rule. 11.2 Submitting Policy Proposals to the Board of Directors After the sponsoring Committee completes the policy proposal and any necessary public comment process, the Committee submits the proposal to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may take any of the following actions: Approve the proposal without amendment. Amend and then approve the proposal. Reject the proposal. Refer the proposal back to the sponsoring Committee or to other Committees for additional consideration. Any other action the Board decides is appropriate. These actions may also be con sidered and implemented by the Executive Committee between meetings of the Board of Directors. For more information, see Article IV: Executive Committee of these Bylaws. Policies approved by the Board of Directors with or without amendment and recommended as non - mandatory will be implemented as described below. Policies approved by the Boa rd of Directors and recommended to be enforced as mandatory policies are forwarded to the Secretary of HHS for review and comment according to the OPTN Final Rule , section 121.4(b)(2) at least 60 days before implementation. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Networ k (OPTN) Bylaws Article XI: Adoption of Policies Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 40 11.3 Notification of Policy Up dates Some policies approved by the Board of Directors will require an update to the UNetsm computer allocation and matching system. After the system update is completed to reflect the new policy, the OPTN contractor will provide notice to OPTN member s and the Secretary of HHS through mailings, newsletters, or the Internet. Policy updates will also be posted to the OPTN web site. 11.4 Ongoing Policy Review Committees periodically evaluate OPTN policies to determine if the policies are meeting stated objectives and remain current with scientific and technological advances. Depending on the outcomes of these assessments, proposals for additional policies or changes to existing policie s may be proposed. 11.5 Non- substantive Changes to Policy The OPTN Contractor may correct any of the following: Capitalization or punctuation, as needed to maintain consistency with current policy Typographical, spelling, or grammatical errors Lettering and numbering of a rule or the subparts of a rule, according to style conventions in current policy Cross -references to rules or sections that are cited incorrectly because of subsequent repeal, amendment, or reorganization of the sections cited The Executive Committee will retrospectively review any corrections made to policy by the OPTN Contractor. Th e OPTN Contractor may not make any substantive changes to policy without approval of the Board of Directors. 11.6 Adoption of Policies New policy or changes to existing policy adopted by the Board of Directors may periodically be incorporated into these B ylaws by amendment to the Bylaws. Members must comply with all policies after adoption by the Board of Directors and after receiving written notice, even if the policies have not been incorporated as amendments to these Bylaws. 11.7 Emergency Actions Policy proposals that meet at least one of the following criteria may be adopted by the Board of Directors prior to public comment: A proposal that is necessitated by a pending statutory or regulatory change. A proposal that is required due to an emergent public health issue or patient safety factors. A proposal that is necessitated by a new medical device or technology that affects organ allocation, Organ Procurement and Transplantation Networ k (OPTN) Bylaws Article XI: Adoption of Policies Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 41 Instead, the policy development process for these proposals will require all of the following step s: 1. The sponsoring Committee submits the proposal according to 11.2 Submitting Policy Proposals to the Board of Directors . 2. The proposal designates a future date upon which the policy will expire, not more than 12 months beyond the policy's effective date. 3. The policy is distributed for public comment no more than 6 months after approval. This public comment period can be shorter than the normal public comment period but must be at least 30 days. 11.8 Expedited Actions Policy proposals that are expected to be non -controversial may be adopted according to the following process: 1. The Board approves a new or revised policy that includes specific policy language defining components of the policy that will be eligible for future expedited updates as well as the anticipated frequency of updates. 2. At a later date (as directed by the policy timeline), the sponsoring Committee develops a proposal for expedited action as stipulated in the policy. 3. The proposal is distributed for public comment. This public comment period can be shorter than the normal public comment period but must be at least 30 days. 4. The sponsoring committee considers public comments and recommends final adoption of the proposal. 5. If an objection to the use of the expedited action is received during the public comment period by five members of the public, another OPTN committee, or 4 members of the Board of Directors, then the sponsoring Committee will notify the Executive Committee of the objections and proceed with the normal OPTN policy development process. 6. If the specified number of objections in #5 above are not received during the public comment period, then the process will proceed as follows: a. If no objections were raised during the public comment period, the proposal will become effective upon notice to the OPTN membership, unless a different date is specified. b. If one or more objections were raised, then the sponsoring Committee will submit the proposal for final action according to 11.2 Submitting Policy Proposals to the Board of Directors. 11.9 Developing Organ Allocation Policies Policy proposals affecting organ allocation must specify the organ or combination of organs addressed in the policy and summarize how the proposal meets requirements of the OPTN Final Rule, 42 CFR Part 121. A. Guidelines for Organ Allocation Polices Committees developing or evaluating OPTN organ allocation policies should consider all the following: 1. The criteria used in listing and removing candidates on the waiting list, including the medical basis and analyses used in the development of the criteria. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Networ k (OPTN) Bylaws Article XI: Adoption of Policies Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 42 2. Accessibility and socio -economic equity, including how the proposal addresses ethnic barriers to transplantation, ethnic disparities on the waiting list, pediatric access to transplantation, and any barriers to transplantation resulting from economic factors. 3. Processes to promote and assess policy compliance, including prospective review, retrospective review, educatio nal measures, and any actions that might be recommended to the Secretary of HHS in the event of non -compliance. 4. Provisions to address patients on the waiting list under the former policy to ensure their equitable treatment under the policy proposal, inclu ding anticipated impact of the proposal on these patients and continuation of their former priority, within reasonable limits and to the extent possible. 5. Performance indicators to be used to evaluate the policy's effect including how performance will be measured, the basis for measurement, baseline data for evaluating performance of the current policy, projected data showing expected benefit from the proposal, and a plan for periodic review to assess effectiveness of the policy in achieving its goals. 6. Systems that test methods of improving organ allocation data variances, including an assessment of whether the variances are accompanied by a research design and include data collection, analysis plans, time limitations, standards for approving variances, and a determination of whether existing variances would continue under the policy proposal. 7. The impact on the organ allocation system, including: Categories for prioritizing transplant candidates and the medical basis (including medical urgency), supporting r esearch, and current medical practice. Geographic units used for allocating organs, including how criteria such as patient residence or listing location may be overcome by geographic allocation unit definition while considering organ ischemic time, logistical matters, and the availability of specialized transplant and post -transplant care. Overall allocation protocol, demonstrating how organs are allocated according to medical urgency or other relevant categories within geographic units using sound medica l judgment, the best use of donated organs, physician judgment in declining organ offers or use for the potential recipient, suitability for the specific organ or combination of organs, avoidance of organ waste and futile transplants, promotion of patient access to transplantation, efficient management of organ placement, periodic review and revision as appropriate, and disassociation with candidate's place of residence or place of listing as feasible in consideration of the previously listed elements. B. Organ Allocation Policy Data Analysis In developing organ allocation policy, data analysis should include: Organ Procurement and Transplantation Networ k (OPTN) Bylaws Article XI: Adoption of Policies Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 43 The effect on transplant programs that perform different transplant volumes. Organ -specific analyses within transplant programs. Risk-adjusted total life-years pre - and post -transplant. Risk-adjusted post -transplant patient and graft survival rates. Risk-adjusted waiting time. Risk-adjusted transplantation rates. The performance of OPOs. The performance of the OPTN Contractor. Other data as determined by the reviewing Committees. Review of data may result in additional questions and the need for further study and analysis, dismissal of the proposal, or formulation of a proposal by the Committee.

This includes statements, investigations, materials provided, or inquiries, oral or written, relating to an applicant's or member's qualifications, as well as the review of all relevant records and documents b. Any act, communication, report, recommendation or disclosure, with respect to any applicant or member made in good faith and at the request of the OPTN Contractor and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix A Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 46 its representatives, anywhere and at any time, for the purposes described in (a) above are privileged to the fullest extent permitted b y law as part of the OPTN medical peer review. The medical peer review privilege extends to any third parties who either supply or are supplied information and are authorized to receive, release or act upon the same. c. The immunity and release from liability provided in this section shall not apply to acts of willful misconduct by the OPTN Contractor and its representatives. B. Initial Review of the Membership Application To initiate the review of any new membership application, the applicant must deliver a completed application, including all requested supporting documentation to the Chair of the MPSC, the Executive Director, or their designated representative. The MPSC will not accept applications for review that are incomplete or missing supporting documentation. Designated staff of the OPTN Contractor will conduct a preliminary review of all submitted applications to ensure that they are complete. This initial review will occur for all application types. New membership applications that are not completed correctly or are missing information will be considered incomplete. The OPTN Contractor will not forward incomplete applications to the MPSC for review. The MPSC Chair, the Executive Director, or their designated representative will notify the applicant if an application is incomplete and provide guidelines for correctly completing the application. It is ultimately the applicant's responsibility to obtain and submit the missing information necessary for the application to be reviewed. C. MPSC Review of the Completed Membership Application The Board of Directors makes all final decisions regarding membership and transplant program applications. Before being considered by the Board, the MPSC reviews all applications and submits a written report with recommendations regarding the application to the Board of Directors. The MPSC Chair, or a chosen representative, may appoint an MPSC subcommittee of at least four MPSC members to review the completed application and supporting documentation. The MPSC subcommittee may make recommendations regarding applications for membership or approval as a designated transplant program. The MPSC subcommittee's recommendations are advi sory to the MPSC and the Board of Directors. MPSC Subcommittee Review and Recommendation A unanimous decision of approval by the MPSC subcommittee reviewing the application will result in interim approval of the application. Interim approval means that the member may function as an OPTN member while awaiting review by the entire MPSC and the Board of Directors. A member granted interim approval does not have voting privileges on OPTN matters. If any member of the MPSC subcommittee recommends rejection of the application, the applicant will not receive interim approval, and the application will be reviewed by the entire MPSC at its next meeting. MPSC Review and Recommendation Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix A Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 47 All applications reviewed by the MPSC subcommittee are sent to the entire MPSC for review at its next meeting. Based on the review at this meeting, the Chair will submit a written report with recommendations regarding the application to the Board of Directors. This report includes: 1. The reason for each recommendation, supported by citations to the completed application and any other documentation considered by the MPSC. 2. All dissenting or minority views that differ from the final recommendation, also supported by citations to the completed application and any other documentation considered by the MPSC. Interim MPSC Approval of the Membership Application An application approved by the entire MPSC receives interim approval until final review by the Board of Direct ors. This approval is in effect until a final determination is made by the Board of Directors. Interim approval will: 1. Grant the applicant OPTN membership or designated transplant program approval, as applicable. 2. Expire when and if the full Board rejects the interim action. MPSC Rejection of the Membership Application The MPSC must offer the applicant an interview if the MPSC recommends that the Board of Directors rejects a membership application. The applicant may also be entitled to a hearing with the M PSC and an appearance before the Board of Directors prior to the Board of Directors taking a final action on any MPSC recommendation. Any interviews, hearings, or Board of Directors appearances that occur as part of the membership application process will be held according to Appendix L: Reviews and Actions . D. Final Board of Director's Review of the Membership Application When the MPSC recommends that an application be approved, the MPSC Chair will forward the MPSC's report and recommendation to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will review the application and act on it during its next regular meeting if the following conditions are met: 1. The Board of Directors receives the recommendation from the MPSC at least 10 business days before the meeting. 2. A quorum is present at the meeting. Any application not received at least 10 business days before the meeting will not be c onsidered until the next regular Board meeting at which a quorum is present. If the MPSC gave the application interim approval, a decision to defer the matter will continue the interim approval until the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors where a quorum is present. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix A Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 48 A majority vote of the Directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present is required to approve a new member. E. Appeals to the Secretary Applicants rejected for membership in the OPTN or for designation as a transplant program may appeal to the Secretary. Appeals shall be submitted in writing within 30 days of rejection of the application. The Secretary may deny the appeal or direct the OPTN to take action consistent with the Secretary's response to the appeal. F. Geog raphically Isolated Transplant Program Applicants The MPSC may recommend to the Board of Directors the approval of a designated transplant program if the prospective program cannot satisfy the current key personnel requirements due to its geographical isolation. Geographically isolated applicants must demonstrate to the MPSC that the proposed key personnel have both a satisfactory level of transplant experience and an established history of transplant success for the specific organ type indicated in the app lication for designated transplant program status. MPSC recommendation of approval of a geographically isolated program that is not otherwise qualified does not give interim approval to the prospective program. The designated transplant program status of a geographically isolated program that is not otherwise qualified is effective only upon approval of the Board of Directors. For purposes of this provision, \"geographically isolated\" is defined as a program located entirely within a state or commonwealth noncontiguous with the mainland United States. This includes Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. A.2 Re-application after Rejection for Membership An applicant who has been denied OPTN membership or designated transplant program approval may re-apply for membership. A re -application is processed the same as the initial application and is evaluated based on criteria in effect when the re -application is submitted. The applicant may be required to submit additional information to the MPSC or the Board of Directors to demonstrate that the issues resulting in the earlier rejection of the application have been resolved. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix B Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 49 Appendix B: Membership Requirements for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) B.1 OPO Compliance By accepting membership in the OPTN, OPOs agree to comply with all OPTN Obligations according to Article 1.1.E: Member Compliance . If any regulatory agency takes a final adverse action against an OPO, the OPO must notify the OPTN Contractor in writing within 10 business days. The OPO must also provide all documents relating to the final adverse action to the OPTN Contractor. B.2 OPO Performance Requirements The Memb ership and Professional Standards Committee (MPSC) will evaluate all OPOs to determine if the difference in observed and expected organ yield can be accounted for by some unique aspect of the Donation Service Area or OPO in question. Those OPOs whose obs erved organ yield rates fall below the expected rates by more than a specified threshold will be reviewed. The absolute values of relevant parameters in the formula may be different for different organs, and may be reviewed and modified by the MPSC after d istribution to the transplant community and subsequent Board approval. The initial criteria used to identify OPOs with lower than expected organ yield, for all organs as well as for each organ type, will include all of the following: 1. More than 10 fewer observed organs per 100 donors than expected yield (Observed per 100 donors - Expected per 100 donors < -10). 2. A ratio of observed to expected yield less than 0.90. 3. A two -sided p -value is less than 0.05. All three criteria must be met for an OPO to be identified for MPSC review. If an OPO's organ yield rate cannot be explained by donor mix or some other unique clinical aspect of the OPO or Donation Service Area in question, the member, in cooperation with the MPSC, will adopt and promptly implement a p lan for performance improvement. The member's failure to adopt and promptly implement a plan for quality improvement will be considered a noncompliance with OPTN Obligations and may result in an OPTN action according to Appendix L: Reviews and Actions . As part of this process, the MPSC may conduct a peer visit to the OPO at the member's expense. The MPSC may also require, at its discretion, that the member participate in an informal discussion. The informal discussion will be conducted according to Appendix L: Reviews and Actions .

Transplant hospitals that annually perform, or intend to perform, 50 percent or more of their total transplants in patients less than 18 years of age will be identified as primarily serving pediatric patients. C. Review of Pediatric Transplant Activity at Transplant Hospitals that Share a Campus Transplant hospitals that primarily serve pediatric patients, and that share a campus with another transplant hospital, will be reviewed periodically by the MPSC to verify that it performed 50 percent or more of its transplants in patients less than 18 years of age during the previous 12 months. Any transplant hospital that is identified as not meeting this 50 percent threshold in any 12 month period will have the opportunity to explain its pediatric inactivity in a Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix D Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 65 report to the MPSC. As part of its review of pediatric transplantation activity at transplant hospitals that share a campus, the MPSC may require that the member participate in an informal discussion. The informal discussion will be conducted according Appendix L: Reviews and Actions. The MPSC may recommend that a transplant hospital sharing a campus with another transplant hospital inactivate due to one hospital no longer primarily serving pediatric patients. A member's failure to inactivate when the MP SC recommends it do so will be considered a noncompliance with OPTN Obligations that may result in an OPTN action according to Appendix L: Reviews and Actions . D.3 Designated Transplant Program Requirement In order to receive organs for transplantation, a transplant hospital member must have current approval as a designated transpl ant program for at least one organ.

Review of Member Functional Inactivity Transplant program functional inactivity will be reviewed periodically by the MPSC. Any program identified as functionally inactive will have the opportunity to explain its inactivity in a report to the MPSC. As part of its review of a program's functional inactivity, the MPSC may require, that the member participate in an informal discussion. The informal discussion will be conducted according to Appendix L: Reviews and Actions . The MPSC may recommend that a program inactivate or withdraw its designated transplant program status due to the program's functional inactivity. The MPSC must offer the member an informal discussion before recommending that the program inactivate or withdraw its designated transplant program status. A program's failure to inactivate or withdraw its designated transplant program status when the MPSC recommends it do so will be considered a noncompliance with OPTN Obligations and may result in an OPTN action according to Appendix L: Reviews and Actions . D.12 Additional Transplant Program Requi rements A. Transplant Program Performance Appendix D.12.A does not apply to VCA transplants. The MPSC will conduct reviews of transplant program performance to identify potential risks to patient health or public safety, as evidence by either: Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix D Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 79 1. The probability that the transplant program meets any of the following criteria is greater than 50% for adult transplants a. The transplant program's offer acceptance rate ratio is less than 0.30 during a 1 year period. b. The transplant program's 90 -day post -transplant graft survival hazard ratio is great er than 1.75 during the 2.5 year time period. For pancreas transplant programs, 90 -day post -transplant patient survival hazard ratio is greater than 1.75 during a 2.5 year period c. The transplant program's 1 -year post -transplant graft survival conditional on 90 -day post -transplant graft survival hazard ratio is greater than 1.75 during a 2.5 year period. For pancreas transplant programs, 1 -year post -transplant patient survival condit ional on 90 -day post -transplant patient survival hazard ratio is great than 1.75 during a 2.5 year period. 2. The probability is that the transplant program meets any of the following criteria is greater than 50% for pediatric transplants a. The transplant progr am's offer acceptance rate ratio is less than 0.35 during a 1 year period. b. The transplant program's 90 -day post -transplant graft survival hazard ratio is greater than 1.60 during a 2.5 year period. c. The transplant program's 1 -year post -transplant graft survival conditional on 90 day post -transplant graft survival hazard ratio is greater than 1.60 during a 2.5 year period. If a transplant program meets either of the above criteria based on reports produced by Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), it must participate in an MPSC performance review. As part of the transplant program review, the MPSC may require the member to take appropriate actions to determine if the program has demonstrated sustainable improvement including, but not limited to: Providing information about the program structure, procedures, protocols and quality review processes Adopting and implementing a plan for improvement Participating in an informal discussion with MPSC members as described in Appendix L: Reviews and Actio ns Participating in a peer visit as described in Appendix L: Review and Actions Once a member is under transplant program performance review, the MPSC will continue to review the program until the MPSC determines that the program has made sufficient and sustainable improvements in acting to avoid risk to public health or patient safety. If the MPSC's review determines that a risk to patient health or public safety exists, the MPSC may request that a member inactivate or withdraw a designated transplant program, or a specific component of the program to mitigate the risk. Before the MPSC requests that a member inactivate or withdraw a designated transplant program or a specific component of the program due to concerns identified during a performance review, the MPSC must offer the member an informal discussion with the MPSC, as described in Appendix L: Reviews and Actions . A member's failure to fully participate in the review process or to act to avoid a risk to patient health or public safety may result in action taken under Appendix L: Reviews and Actions . Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix D Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 80 B. Patient Notification Requirements for Waiting List Inactivation A transplant program must provide written notice to candidates if it does either or both of the following: 1.

The explanation that during the period of inactivity, organs cannot be accepted on the candidate's behalf at this transplant program 4. The options available to the candidate during this period, including multiple listing or transferring of accrued waiting time to another Transplant Hospital 5. How the candidates will be notified when the waiting list is reactivated or if the expected length of inactivation is extended 6. A copy of the OPTN Contractor's Patient Information Letter Note: If written notice is required because a transplant program exceeded the inactive waiting list threshold due to cumulative periods of inactivation, then the written notice must also include the dates of each instance of waiting list inactivation. Written notice must be provided within the periods defined in the table below: For... Written Notice Must be Provided... Periods of waiting list inactivation scheduled at least 30 days in advance 30 days before inactivity begins. Periods of waiting list inactivation scheduled less than 30 days in advance No more than 7 days following the initial date of waiting list inactivation. Any periods of waiting list inactivation related to a cumulative period of inactivation No more than 7 days following the last date of the inactive period that caused the transplant program to exceed the inactive waiting list threshold. C. Routine Referral Procedures Each transplant hospital must develop and follow routine referral procedures for all potential donors. Each transplant hospital is further expected to demonstrate compliance based on an Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix D Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 81 annual medical record review, performed in collaboration with the OPO.

A designated liver transplant program's conditional approval for a pediatric component is valid for a maximum of 24 months. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix F Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 123 D. Full Approval for a Pediatric Component following Conditional Approval The conditional approval period begins on the first approval date granted to the pediatric component application, whether it is interim approval granted by the MPSC subcommittee, or approval granted by the full MPSC. The conditional approval period ends 24 months after first approval date of the pediatric component application. The MPSC may consider granting a 24 -month conditional approval extension to the designated liver transplant for its pediatric component if the program provides substantial evidence of progress toward fulfilling the requirements, but is unable to complete all of the requirements within the initial 24 -month period. Once the designated liver transplant program has met the full approval requirements for the pediatric component, the program may petition the OPTN for full approval. If the designated liver transplant program is unable to demonstrate that it has both a pediatric primary liver surgeon onsite that meets all of the requirements as described in Section F.7. A: Primary Pediatric Liver Transplant Surgeon Requirements and a pediatric primary liver physician onsite that meets all of the requirements as described in Section F.7. B: Primary Pediatric Liver Transplant Physician Requirements at the end of the 24 -month conditional approval period, it must inactivate its pediatric component as described in Appendix K: Transplant Program Inactivit y, Withdrawal, and Termination. E. Emergency Membership Exceptions for Candidates Less than 18 Years Old A designated liver transplant program that does not have an approved pediatric component may register a patient less than 18 years old on the waiting list if both of the following conditions are met: 1. The patient meets the requirements for pediatric status 1A according to OPTN Policy 9.1.B: Pediatric Status 1A Requirements . This does not include a patient who meets the status 1A requirements by exception according to OPTN Policy 9.3: Status Exceptions . 2. The primary pediatric physician or primary pediatric surgeon at an approved pediatric liver component confirms that it is not medically advisable to transport this patient to a liver transplant program with an approved pediatric component. The transplant program that registers the candidate must document this confirmation. If at any time the candidate no longer meets these criteria, the transplant program must remove the candidate from their waiting list within 24 hours, and may not transplant the candidate. The transplant program must assist candidates in transferring to other designated transplant programs. Registration of a candidate less than 18 years old through an emergency exception does not grant the transplant program pediatric component approval.

Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix K Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 186 Appendix K: Transplant Program Inactivity, Withdrawal, and Termination This appendix defines transplant program inactivity, withdrawal, and termination, and outlines what members must do to be in compliance with OPTN obligations during these periods. K.1 Transplant Program Inactivity Transplant programs must remain active in transplantation to maintain membership in the OPTN. There are two types of member inactivity: 1. Short -term Inactivity 2. Long- term Inactivity A member may voluntarily inactivate a transplant program, on a short -term o r long -term basis, for reasons including but not limited to: The inability to meet functional activity requirements. The inability to serve potential candidates, candidates, recipients, potential living donors, or living donors for a period of 15 or more consecutive days. Temporarily lacking required physician or surgeon coverage. A substantial change in operations that requires an interruption in transplantation. For more information about the functional activity requirements for transplant programs, see Section D.11: Review of Transplant Program Functional Activity of these Bylaws. A. Program Component Cessation Programs that cease performing a specific type of transplant (e.g. the living donor component of a transplant program, or cessation of only pediatric or only adult transplants in a transplant program that performs both), must notify every patient affected by the cessation, including: Potential candidates, including thos e currently in the referral or evaluation process All candidates registered on the waiting list Potential living donors, including those currently in the referral process, in the evaluation process, or awaiting donation Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix K Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 187 Ceased Component* All Affected Pati ents Being Treated or Evaluated by the Transplant Program Including: Living Donor Component Potential Living Donors Potential and waitlisted candidates who have already expressed interest in LD Deceased Donor Component Potential and waitlisted deceased donor candidates Adult Component Potential and waitlisted adult candidates Potential and waitlisted pediatric candidates who may turn 18 during the component cessation period Pediatric Component Potential and waitlisted pediatric candidates *In instances when a program elects to cease transplant for a subset of patients within a program component, such as infants in a pediatric component, the affected group would be further defined to only include that specific patient population. For more information about the notification content and timing requirements, see Appendix K, Section K.3: Long -term Inactive Transplant Program Status and Section K.4: Withdrawal or Termination of Designated Transplant Program Status of these Bylaws. K.2 Short -term Inactive Transplant Program Status Short -term inactivity is defined as a transplant program that is inactive for no more than 14 consecutive days. A transplant program may voluntarily inactivate for no more than 14 days by changing its UNet SM waiting list status to inactive . When a member intends to voluntarily inactivate a transplant program on a short -term basis, the member is not required to notify the OPTN . A. Notice to Patients A transplant program must provide candidates and recipients with a written summary of its Program Coverage Plan at the time of listing and any time there are substantial changes in program or personnel. If a transplant program knows that it will have perio ds of short -term inactivity, this should be clearly stated as part of the Program Coverage Plan provided at the time of listing. For more information about the Program Coverage Plan, see Section D.7. B: Surgeon and Physician Coverage (Program Coverage Plan) of these Bylaws. K.3 Long -term Inactive Transplant Program Status Long- term inactivity occurs when a transplant program is inactive for 15 or more consecutive days. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix K Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 188 Members should voluntarily inactivate a transplant program that is not able to serve potential candidates, candidates, living donors, or recipients for 15 or more consecutive days. Voluntary inactivation may extend for a period of up to 12 months. Long term inactivation results in an inactive waiting list status and an inactive membership status. A. Notice to the OPTN of Long -term Inactive Status When a member will voluntarily inactivate a transplant program for 15 or more consecutive days, it must provide written notice, including the reasons for inactivation, to the OPTN Executive Director. B. Notice to the Patients of Long -term Inactive Status When a member intends to inactivate a transplant program for 15 or more consecutive days, it must provide written notice to the transplant program's potential candidates, candidates, recipients, and living donors currently being treated by the transplant program. Written notice should be provided at least 30 days prior to the planned inactivation date by a method that can be tracked and that provides proof of receipt, such as: Commercial overnight delivery service Secure electronic communication Register ed or certified mail, return receipt requested Written notice must be provided no later than 7 days after inactivation and include all of the following: 1. The reasons for inactivating the transplant program. 2. Explanation that although the patient is still on the waiting list, the candidate cannot receive an organ offer through this program while it is inactive. 3. Options for potential candidates, candidates, recipients, and living donors to transfer to another transplant program. 4. Prior to being registered as an active candidate at another transplant program, the accepting transplant program will complete an evaluation to determine suitability for registration. 5. The phone number of the inactive program's administrative office that can help with transferring to another transplant program. The member must provide to the OPTN a sample of each type of patient notice it sends to potential candidates, candidates, recipients, and living donors along with a list of patients who received the notice. If a natural disaster adversely affects the function of a transplant program, the patient Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix K Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 189 notification requirements will be applied reasonably and flexibly. C. Reactivation after Voluntary Long -term Inactive Status A member transplant hospital may reactivate its pro gram after long -term voluntary inactivation by submitting the application materials required by the Membership and Professional Standards Committee (MPSC). The MPSC will decide if all criteria for membership are met and that the program can reactivate. The MPSC will then recommend that the Board of Directors notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the member's reactivation. D. Extension of Voluntary Long -term Inactive Status A transplant hospital that voluntary inactivates may request an extension beyond 12 months by making a request to the MPSC. The request must explain how the extension will benefit the program, and include a comprehensive plan with a timeline for resuming transplantation at the hospital. The program must document that all membership criteria will be met when transplantation is resumed. Requests are subject to the MPSC's review and approval. K.4 Withdrawal or Termination of Designated Transplant Program Status Designated transplant program withdrawal means that a member voluntarily gives up its designated transplant program status and provides written notice to the OPTN. Members that withdraw from designated transplant program status are voluntarily closing the transplant program. Termination of designated transplant program status means that a member's designated transplant program status is terminated by the Secretary of HHS. In the case of noncompliance with policies covered by Section 1138 of the Social Security Act, the MPSC may recommend that the Board of Directors or the Executive Committee request approval from the Secretary to terminate a member's designated transplant program status as described in Appendix L: Revi ews and Actions of these Bylaws. The Board of Directors or the Executive Committee may, at its own discretion, request this approval from the Secretary. Once a member voluntarily withdraws from designated transplant program status or is terminated by the Secretary of HHS, that transplant program may no longer perform organ transplants. At this time, the member must also assist candidates in transferring to another transplant program, as described in Section K.5: Transition Plan during Long- term Inactivity, Termination, or Withdrawal below. A. Notice to the OPTN A transplant hospital must provide written notice to the OPTN within 30 days of the intent to withdraw its designated transplant program status, including the effective date and reasons for the withdrawal. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix K Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 190 B. Notice to the Patients When a transplant hosp ital intends to withdraw its designated transplant program status, or its designated transplant program status is terminated, it must provide written notice to the transplant program's potential candidates, candidates, recipients, and living donors current ly receiving care. Written notice should be provided at least 30 days prior to the anticipated date of withdrawal or termination by a method that can be tracked and that provides proof of receipt such as: Commercial overnight delivery service Secure electronic communication Registered or certified mail, return receipt requested Written notice must be provided no later than 7 days following withdrawal or termination and include: 1. The reasons for loss of designated transplant program Status. 2. Explanation that although the patient is still on the waiting list, the candidate cannot receive an organ offer through this program. 3. Options for potential candidates, candidates, recipients, and living donors to transfer to another transplant program. 4. Prior to being registered as an active candidate at another transplant program, the accepting transplant program will complete an evaluation to determine suitability for registration. 5. The phone number of the program's administrative office that can help with transferring the candidate or potential candidate to another program. The member must p rovide to the OPTN a sample of each type of patient notice it sends to potential candidates, candidates, recipients, and living donors along with a list of patients who received the notice. K.5 Transition Plan during Long -term Inactivity, Termination, or Withdrawal When a member transplant hospital experiences long -term inactivity, withdraws its designated transplant program status, or its designated transplant program status is terminated, it must: 1. Immediately suspend organ transplantation for the transplant program. 2. Assist potential candidates and candidates in transferring to other designated transplant programs. 3. Provide a list to the OPTN of all of the transplant program's candidates on the waiting list at the time of long -term inactivity, withdrawal, or termination and update it throughout this process. The program should indicate on the list of each candidate if: Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix K Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 191 A candidate or potential candidate chooses not to transfer to an alternative transplant program, provide the reason and indicate whether the candidate has been completely informed of the implications of this decision before they are removed from the waiting list. A candidate or potential candidate chooses to transfer, indicate the transplant program to which the candidate is transfe rring. Periodic status updates will be required that documents each candidate's transfer progress until the candidate is evaluated and accepted on the waiting list by another transplant program or removed from the waiting list. a. Expedite removal of all candidates from the transplant program's waiting list, or, if the patient requests, transfer the candidate to another OPTN member transplant hospital. b. Initiate transfer of all active candidates hospitalized at the transplant program to an accepting transplant hospital within 7 days of long -term inactivity, withdrawal, or termination. The transplant program must complete the transfer process within 14 days unless transfer would be unsafe or discharge is anticipated within that time, or circumstances outside of the program's control exist that prevent transfer within 14 days. The program must document and submit to the OPTN all efforts to transfer its hospitalized candidates, if it is unable to meet these time periods. c. Provide a priority list of the most urgent candidates listed at the transplant program with an individualized plan of transfer, potential alternative transplant programs, and a timeline for transferring these candidates according to the following priorities: For liver candidates, all Status 1A and 1B candidates must be transferred within 7 days of long -term inactivity, withdrawal, or termination, followed by all active candidates in descending MELD/PELD score order, with all candidates whose MELD/PELD score exceeds 25 to be transferred within 30 days, followed by all inactive candidates. For lung candidates, active candidates should be transferred according to descending Lung Allocation Scores with highest scores first, followed by inactive candidates. For kidney candidates, those whose PRA (measured or calculated) is over 80 percent should be transferred first, followed by all other active candidates in order of waiting time, then transfer of all inactive candidates last. For heart candidates, all pediatric status 1A and 1B and adult status 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be transferred within 7 days of long-term inactivity, withdrawal, or termination. For multi- visceral organ transplant candidates, transfer must be completed within 30 days of long -term inactivity, withdrawal, or termination. All active candidates should be transferred within 60 days of long -term inactivity, withdrawal, or termination without considering these guidelines. The program must document and submit to the OPTN all efforts made for transfer of its candidates if it is unable to meet these deadlines. Document all efforts to transfer candidates to an alternative designated transplant program including all contacts made to facilitate the transfer of candidates. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix K Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 192 Remove every transplant candidate from the transplant program's waiting list wi thin 12 months of the program's long- term inactivity, withdrawal, or termination date. A member that experiences long -term inactivity, withdrawal, or termination of a designated transplant program may still have the ability to temporarily provide care to transplant candidates, and provide follow -up care as necessary to transplant recipients and living donors. Should the transplant program continue to provide follow -up care to transplant recipients and living donors, the program must continue to submit OPTN follow up forms through UNetSM. Alternatively, transplant recipients may transfer care to another hospital. K.6 Transferred Candidates Waiting Time To ensure equity in waiting times and ease the transfer of candidates from the waiting list, the candidates at programs that voluntarily inactivate, withdraw or lose designated transplant program status will: 1. Retain existing waiting time. 2. Continue to accr ue waiting time according to their status on the waiting list at the time of the program's inactivation, withdrawal, or termination of designated transplant program status. This total accrued waiting time can be transferred to the candidate's credit when the candidate is listed with a new transplant program. The OPTN may collectively transfer patients from a transplant program, with a status of long -term inactive, withdrawal, or termination, and in other circumstances upon request to one or more active transplant programs. The transferring transplant program must complete all of the following before a collective transfer: 1. All required patient notifications according to Section K.3: Long- term Inactive Transplant Program Status or Section K.4: Withdrawal or Termination of Designated Transplant Program Status. 2. A written agreement with each accepting transplant program that includes all of the following: a. Request for collective transfer of candidates' waiting times b. List of patient names and identifiers to be transferred c. Mutually agreed upon transfer date d. Assurance of notification and patient consent to transfer according to Section K.5: Transition Plan during Long- term Inactivity, Termination, or Withdrawal e. List of active candidates that the transferring program agrees to change to inactive status if requested by the accepting transplant program f. Acknowledgement that all patient information and records available to the OPTN will be transferred without modification g. Acknowledgement that the transplant program accepting the patients accepts responsibility for Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix K Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 193 patient notification and management according to all applicable OPTN Policies and Bylaws Each accepting transplant program must develop and implement a plan that i ncludes all of the following: 1. Procedure and timeline for reviewing the status on each collectively transferred candidate and amending this status as appropriate until an evaluation is completed in accordance with the accepting program's selection and listing protocol. 2. If the transferred candidate's status is changed from active to inactive as part of the collective transfer agreement or part of implementing the accepting transplant program's plan, then the accepting transplant hospital must notify the candidate about the status change. The notification must include what the candidate must do to be considered for an active status at the accepting transplant program. The notification must be completed within 14 days after the collective transfer date or after the status change date if it occurs post -collective transfer as part of this plan. 3. Expected timeline for completing evaluations and subsequent waiting list status adjustments on collective transfer candidates according to the accepting program's selection and listing protocol. Upon receipt of the written agreement and plan, the OPTN will review the information and provide an expected collective transfer completion date to all the transplant programs involved. After the collective transfer process has been completed, the OPTN will provide written notification to the transplant programs. The accepting hospital must submit a progress report to the OPTN that contains an update on the evaluation status of each collective transfer candidate at day 90 following the collective transfer. The accepting hospital must submit this report within 14 days after day 90 following the collective transfer. Additional updates may be requested from the OPTN to monitor progress until all collective transfer candidates are evaluated and accepted on the waiting list by a transplant program or removed from the waiting list. If the transferring transplant program no longer qualifies as a designated transplant program and does not complete the requirements according to Appendix K , the OPTN may approve and comple te a collective transfer of candidates' registrations and waiting times if the accepting transplant program requests in writing to complete the transfer . K.7 Laboratory Tests If a transplant program is inactivated, terminated or withdraws from membership, it is still responsible for evaluating its candidates. This includes, but is not limited to, performing laboratory tests and evaluations required to maintain the candidate's a ppropriate status on the waiting list until the time of transfer.

While on site, the peer visit panel will review records, interview staff and tour the facilities as desired. After the visit, the peer visit panel will prepare a report for the MPSC. The MPSC will review the report and determine the appropriate next steps. A member's refusal to participate in the peer visit in the time and format determined by the MPSC Chair, or a member's refusal to provide requested information or to make available requested personnel, will be considered a potential noncompliance with the OPTN Obliga tions. L.7 Requests to Mitigate Risks If an OPTN review suggests a potentially urgent or severe risk exists to patient health or public safety, the OPTN may ask that the member take appropriate actions to mitigate the urgency and severity of the risk. A m ember's failure to sufficiently mitigate the risk in the period requested will be considered a separate potential noncompliance with OPTN Obligations. L.8 Scheduling MPSC and Member Interactions Members currently under MPSC review may be offered specific opportunities, in the form of informal discussions, interviews, and hearings, to interact with the MPSC. The MPSC Chair will determine when these interactions will be scheduled. Factors that will influence the scheduling of these MPSC and member interactio ns include, but are not limited to, any of the following: The urgency and severity of the issue Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix L Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 196 Whether the member has taken appropriate actions that mitigate the urgency and severity of the risk Adequate time for members to demonstrate the results and su stainability of their containment and corrective action plans The MPSC's meeting schedule The OPTN will notify the member when the MPSC is offering an informal discussion, interview, or hearing.

Informal discussions are intended to provide the MPSC and member an opportunity to openly discuss the review and seek feedback. Inf ormal discussions are information gathering activities that may lead to a more efficient and effective review than written correspondence and document reviews alone. A. Member Informal Discussion Requests A member currently under review by the MPSC may re quest an informal discussion at any time. Members requesting an informal discussion must submit all of the following: 1. The reasons the member is requesting an informal discussion, including the applicable OPTN Policy or Bylaw 2. A summary of what the member w ould like to present to the MPSC, or what the member would like the MPSC to address during the informal discussion 3. Any information the member would like the MPSC to consider in advance of the informal discussion The MPSC Chair will accept or decline a member's request for an informal discussion with the MPSC within 14 days of receiving the member's request. The OPTN will notify the member of the MPSC Chair's decision. B. MPSC Informal Discussion Requests The MPSC or MPSC Chair may offer members currently under review one or more informal discussions at any time. A transplant program is entitled to an informal discussion before the MPSC recommends that the program , or a component of the program, inactivate or withdraw its designated transplant program status due to functional inactivity or transplant program performance reviews according to Appendix D: Membership Requirements for Transplant Hospitals and Transplant Programs. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix L Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 197 C. Waiving an Inform al Discussion Members that decline the MPSC's informal discussion request may submit additional written information for the MPSC's review. The MPSC Chair will set a date by which the member must provide any additional written information.

If the MPSC determines the matter represents a potentially urgent and severe risk to patient health or public safety, the MPSC may recommend to the OPTN President that the OPTN Executive Committee considers the MPSC's recommendation to allow for a more timely resolution of the matter. The OPTN will notify the member following the hearing if the MPSC's recommendation also includes a recommendation that the OPTN Executive Comm ittee considers the recommendation. L.12 Appearances before the Board of Directors Members and the MPSC Chair may appear before the Board of Directors prior to the Board of Directors taking a final action on an MPSC recommendation. Appearances before the Board of Directors are formal procedures that provide an opportunity for the MPSC Chair to explain the MPSC's recommendation and for a member to present specific reasons as to why the Board of Directors should not support the MPSC's recommendation. If the OPTN President determines that an urgent and severe risk to patient health or public safety exists and that allowing the OPTN Executive Committee to consider the recommendation will allow for a more timely resolution of the matter, the OPTN President may permit the appearance to take place before the OPTN Executive Committee instead of the Board of Directors. In these instances, all requirements, considerations, and actions described in the sections that follow that pertain to appearances before the Board of Directors will apply to appearances before the OPTN Executive Committee.

Possible Board of Directors Appearance Outcomes At the conclusion of the Board of Directors appearance, the Board of Directors will approve the MPSC's recommendation or is sue a lesser action and will notify the member of the outcome. Within 21 days of the Board of Directors appearance, the OPTN will provide the member with a written summary of the Board of Directors appearance. If the Board of Directors approves an adverse action, the OPTN will issue a public notice and the member must provide additional notice within 30 days of receiving the Board of Directors appearance summary as required according to Section L.12.D: OPTN Adverse Actions . Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix L Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 203 L.13 OPTN Actions The OPTN may impose actions based on a member's failure to comply with OPTN Obligations. The OPTN may impose a separate action for each noncompliance or may choose to impose a single action for all related instances of noncompliance. The OPTN may also require a member to perform specific activities to address a noncompliance. The OPTN will document all actions in the member's compliance history. A. Deferred Disposition Deferred Disposition is a period to allow the member additional time to demonstrate improvemen t and its ability and willingness to meet OPTN Obligations. Only the MPSC may offer a member a Deferred Disposition period. The MPSC may offer a Deferred Disposition period at any time before a hearing and may offer a member more than one Deferred Disposit ion period during a review. Deferred Disposition does not apply to rejected membership applications. During this period, the member must demonstrate compliance with OPTN Obligations, including implementation of and adherence to the member's corrective action plan or plan for quality improvement. The MPSC will specify the length of the Deferred Disposition period, and may end the Deferred Disposition period at any time if the MPSC determines, at its discretion, the member is not demonstrating sufficient imp rovement or is not adhering to the member's corrective action plan or plan for quality improvement. After the Deferred Disposition period, the MPSC will evaluate whether the member has demonstrated improvement and implemented sustainable corrective actions and will determine an appropriate action. The member is not entitled to an informal discussion, interview, hearing or Board of Directors appearance to challenge the MPSC's decision not to offer, or to end, a Deferred Disposition period. B. Types of Acti ons The OPTN may offer Deferred Disposition or take any of the following actions: Close with No Action Issue a Notice of Noncompliance Issue a Letter of Warning Place a member on Probation Declare a member Not in Good Standing These actions represent a range, from Close with No Action to Member Not in Good Standing. Close with No Action, Issuing a Notice of Noncompliance, and Issuing a Letter of Warning are non-adverse actions. Non -adverse actions do not require approval by the Board of Directors and are not made public. Probation and Member Not in Good Standing are adverse actions. Adverse actions are further described in Section L.12.D: OPTN Adverse Actions . Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix L Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 204 C. Determining Appropriate Action Factors considered when determining the appropriate action include, but are not limited to, the extent to which: The member has demonstrated an awareness of and accountability for the noncompliance, including: o whether the member self -reported the noncompliance o whether the member took corrective action when learning of the noncompliance The noncompliance poses an urgent and severe risk to patient health or public safety The noncompliance poses or fails to avoid a substantial risk to the integrity of or trust in the OPTN Patient medical records or other documentation provide sufficient det ail to determine the presence of mitigating factors at the time the noncompliance occurred The noncompliance demonstrates lack of stewardship of donated organs The noncompliance is likely to recur The member has demonstrated previous and ongoing compliance with OPTN Obligations D. OPTN Adverse Actions Probation and Member Not in Good Standing are the two OPTN adverse actions. Adverse actions are OPTN membership designations that must be approved by the Board of Directors and require public notice. A memb er's ongoing failure to comply with OPTN Obligations or a member's failure to promptly address a potentially urgent and severe risk to patient health or public safety may result in the MPSC recommending that the Board of Directors takes an adverse action against the member. Before the Board of Directors approves an adverse action, members have the right to an interview and a hearing with the MPSC and an appearance with the Board of Directors. The Executive Committee will consider MPSC recommendations to r elease a member from an adverse action. 1. Probation a.

It has implemented and adhered to its corrective action plan 2. Its corrective action plan is effective and sustainable 3. Its ongoing compliance with OPTN Obligations The burden is on the member at all times to demonstrate that release from Probation or Member Not in Good Standing is appropriate. c. Possible MPSC Review Outcomes If the MPSC approves the member's request for release from Probation or Member Not in Good Standing, the MPSC will forward its recommendation to the OPTN Executive Committee. The OPTN President will determine the time and format for the OPTN Executive Committee to consider the MPSC's request. If the MPSC rejects the member's request for release from Probation or Member Not in Good Standing, the MPSC must offer the member an interview. d. Possible OPTN Executive Committee Review Outcomes The OPTN President will determine the time and format, either in person or by teleconference, of the review.

The member may submit another request to be released from Probation or Member Not in Good Standing to the MPSC only after it has addressed all of the reasons that the OPTN Executive Committee declined the MPSC's recommendation. 4. Downgrading Member Not in Good Standing At its discretion, the M PSC may recommend that the Board of Directors downgrades a Member Not in Good Standing designation to Probation. The OPTN President will determine the time and format for the OPTN Board of Directors to consider the MPSC's request. The burden is on the member at all times to demonstrate that the lesser adverse action is appropriate. The member is not entitled to an informal discussion, an interview, a hearing or a Board of Directors appearance if the MPSC or the Board of Directors does not support downgrading the Member Not in Good Standing to Probation. If the Board of Directors downgrades a Member Not in Good Standing to Probation, the OPTN will provide notice to the public.

As specified in the OPTN Final Rule, the OPTN will provide any data or documentation to the Secretary that the Secretary requests, in the format requested by the Secreta ry. B. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Representation The Project Officer for the OPTN Contract and the Director of the Division of Transplantation within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of HHS, serve as ex-officio , non - voting members of the OPTN Executive Committee and Board of Directors. As non -voting members of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors, they, or their designees, are Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Bylaws Appendix L Effective Date : 7/27/2023 Page 209 granted full access to all deliberations, determinations, and actions. Re presentatives of HRSA are also ex -officio, non -voting members of the Membership and Professional Standards Committee (MPSC) and granted full access to all MPSC deliberations, determinations, and actions as well. Other designees of the Secretary may also at tend OPTN meetings. C. Special Secretarial Reviews At the request of the Secretary of HHS, the OPTN will conduct special reviews of members when the Secretary has reason to believe that the member may not be in compliance with the OPTN Final Rule or may be acting in a way that poses a risk to patient health or public safety. A Special Review is a review of the member in the manner and within the period specified by the Secretary. This may include, but is not limited to, requests for root cause analysis, co rrective action, and due process proceedings completed in the period and as specified by the Secretary. Members must fully comply with all OPTN requests as part of a Special Review. D. OPTN Recommendations and Requests to the Secretary The OPTN Board of D irectors will advise the Secretary of the results of any ongoing or periodic reviews and evaluations, or Secretarial- directed reviews, of member OPOs and transplant hospitals which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, indicate noncompliance with OPTN Obligations or indicate a risk to the health of patients or to the public safety, and will provide any recommendations for appropriate action by the Secretary. Appropriate actions include, but are not limited to, those described in the OPTN Final Rule, as described in Section L.13.E Secretarial Actions that follows. At any time, the Board of Directors may make recommendations to the Secretary for specific actions, on its own or after receiving a recommendation from the MPSC. A member's failure to come into compliance with OPTN Obligations while designated as a Member Not in Good Standing may result in the Board of Directors recommending that the Secretary take action against the member. If the Board of Directors finds, based on available evidence, that the member's potential violation poses a severe and urgent risk to patient health or public safety, the Board of Directors may recommend that a Secretarial action be made effective immediately, before completing any required interview or hearing. E. Secretarial Actions The Secretary may impose sanctions or take other appropriate action at any time when a member poses a risk to the health of patients or to the public safety.
