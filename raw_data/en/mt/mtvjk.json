Instead of using harmful preservatives such as parabens, BHA or BHT, Human Nature products use natural alternatives, such as corn-derived preservatives. In addition to this, natural formulations often biodegrade much faster than synthetic ones. This is why all our products have a clear expiry date stamped on our packaging. Many times, these two terms are confused with each other because some products can be both organic and natural, or contain both organic and natural ingredients, but they mean different things. A genuinely natural product is made entirely or almost entirely of ingredients that are natural and extracted without the use of synthetic or petroleum-based chemicals. On the other hand, an organic product is made of ingredients that are, in addition, grown without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Human Nature products are genuinely natural, and make use of certified organic ingredients whenever possible.

We purposely do not create whitening products, because we believe that the Filipino natural skin color is beautiful, whatever the hue. Many whitening products in the market also contain harmful chemicals that are toxic to the body when absorbed through the skin over a prolonged period of time. Not only that, they create an unhealthy perspective that beauty depends on how light your skin color is. At Human Nature, we celebrate the beauty of diversity of skin tones of Filipinos and Filipinas everywhere! Yes!
