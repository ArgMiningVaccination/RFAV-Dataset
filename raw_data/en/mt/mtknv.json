The funding to Regeneron is a part of a $5 billion initiative dubbed \"Project NextGen\" by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Regeneron had earlier developed a monoclonal antibody therapy against COVID, which was authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November 2020, but its use was limited [early last year](/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-restrict-use-regeneron-lilly-covid-antibody-drugs-wapo-2022-01-24/) after it was found to be unlikely to work against the Omicron variant. The funding also includes $1 billion for four mid-stage clinical trials of new COVID vaccines, and $100 million to Global Health Investment Corp - a non-profit organization that invests in new technologies that will accelerate responses to diseases.
