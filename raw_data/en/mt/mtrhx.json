Keywords: Lung being connected with large intes- tine; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Clinical applica-tion INTRODUCTION Over the course of many centuries, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has formed a unique theoretical base,and diagnostic treatment techniques. The lung beingconnected with large intestine, is one of the most im-portant theories of TCM, which considers the humanbody to be a united whole. The theory posits that thelung and the large intestine are in physical contact andpathologically interact. 1In China, the theory has guid- ed clinical practice for thousands of years and shownpositive clinical efficacy. 2-6Research has shown that al- though the mechanism of the relationship between thelung and large intestine has not been completely eluci-dated, the theory has been fully accepted. 7 In the last decade, researchers in the field of integratedTCM and Western medicine have conducted compre-hensive in-depth studies of this theory. 8,9The studies in- cluded literature research, clinical 482JTCM|www.journaltcm.com September15,2012 |volume32 |Issue3|LiuPetal.StudyonTCMtheoryoflungbeingconnectedwithlargeintestine diseases influencing the lung, and pulmonary diseases influencing the large intestine, and an effort has beenmade to try to explain the mechanism of how the largeintestine and lung are related. In this study, we reviewthe origin, clinical application, and mechanism of thetheory of \"lung being connected with large intestine\". THEORIGINANDMAINCONTENTS OFTHETHEORY From the historical literature, it is has been shown that the theory of lung being connected with large intestinefirst appeared in the Qin (246-207 BC) and Han dy-nasties (206 BC-220AD), developed further in the Sui(581-618 AD) and Tang dynasties (618-907 AD), and advanced in the Song (960-1279 AD) and Yuan dynas- ties (1580-1368 AD), but was only perfected in theMing (1368-1644 AD) and Qing dynasties (1644-1911 AD).The earliest record of the theory comes from HuangdiNeijing (the Yellow Emperor's Canon of Internal Medi-cine), which is the \"bible\" for TCM and was first pub-lished over 2000 years ago. 10For example, Ling Shu Ben Shu,10a chapter in Huangdi Neijing, was the first to mention the lung being connected with the large in-testine. Then, Ling Shu Hai Lun, 10another chapter in volume one of Huangdi Neijing, proposed that meridi-ans connect with the viscera in the exterior, and link tothe limbs in the exterior. The meridian theory positsthat the Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin can connectwith the Large Intestine Meridian of Hand-Yangmingto form the interior-exterior relationship. It is consid-ered that meridians can connect the inner organs,joints, and extremities, thus converting the whole bodyinto one entire organ. Specifically, the pathways are asfollows: the Qiof the lung connects the large intestine to meridians and vessels and transfers from the indexfinger, branching crevice behind the wrist, and collater-als of acupoint Pianli (LI 6) along the lung meridian in- to the large intestine meridian and then to the large in-testine. Simultaneously, Large Intestine Qican transfer from meridians and vessels into the lung and form thecirculation. A divergent collateral of the lung meridianconnects the large intestine meridian at the side of theneck and forms a circulation route, which extendsfrom the hands to the head and is distributed over theheart. 11,12 However, it is also important to note that in TCM, thenames of the viscera of the human body are quite simi-lar to those used in modern medicine, but many con-notations differ between the two systems. Therefore, itis important to use the concepts of Zang-Fu organs tointerpret the theory. According to TCM theory, thelung, including two lobes on the left and right, is situ-ated in the thorax, communicates with the throat andopens into the nose, which is similar to the anatomicalstructure of the lung in Western medicine. The mainphysiological functions of the lung are to control Qi and respiration, govern dispersing and descending ac-tivities, and regulate the passage of water. The large in-testine is located in the abdomen. Its upper end con-nects with the small intestine through the ileocecumand its lower end connects with the anus. The mainfunction of the large intestine is to receive the wastecontent of food transmitted down from the small intes-tine, absorb part of the liquid from waste, and trans-form the rest into feces to be discharged from the anus,which is similar to the function of large intestine inWestern medicine. 13,14 Studies have shown that in pathological conditions,there are reciprocal affects between the lung and thelarge intestine. 15,16For instance, dysfunction of the lung can lead to constipation. When body fluid is low be-cause of excessive heat in the lung, the large intestinecan have trouble performing movements, and, in conse-quence constipation can occur. In TCM the author ofSu Wen writes \"cough incessantly is suffered from dys-function of large intestine\". 17Furthermore, large intes- tine dysfunction can result in pulmonary dysfunction.For example, dysfunction of the large intestine maycause asthma. 18,19In TCM the author of Lin Shu writes \"Abdominal singing, Qipunching upward to chest, and too puff to stand long, all lie in the evil of large in-testine.\" 20 On this basis, ancient physicians promoted the theorycontinuously. For example, Zhang Jingyue, a distin-guished physician of the Ming Dynasty (1563-1640AD), presented in Complete Works of Zhang Jingyue;the occurrence of pulmonary disease was associatedwith decreased water consumption and the formationof saliva and phlegm, which could indirectly inducethe decrease of fluids in the large intestine. 21Similarly, when the large intestine has a disorder of Qimove- ment, it not only affects the movement of Lung Qi, but also the distribution and excretion of body fluidsin the lung. THEMAINCLINICALAPPLICATION OFTHETHEORYINCHINA The theory of lung being connected with large intes- tine has had a long history of clinical application. Forthousands of years, TCM doctors continuously ex-plored the theory and showed that the theory has im-portant clinical value. It has been demonstrated thatthe significance of the relationship between the lungand large intestine is not only in the explanation oftheir physiological functions, but also for guiding clini-cal practice. 22Therefore, therapeutic principles includ- ing \"regulating the intestine function to treat lung dis-eases\", \"regulating the lung function to treat intestinediseases\", and \"regulating lung and large intestine si-multaneously\" areoftenusedincurrentclinicalpractice. 23 At present, it has been shown that treatment of intesti- 483JTCM|www.journaltcm.com September15,2012 |volume32 |Issue3|LiuPetal.StudyonTCMtheoryoflungbeingconnectedwithlargeintestine nal disease can help treat diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, pulmonaryheart disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome (AR-DS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),and others. 24-26In addition, it has also been found that treatment of disorders of the lung can aid in treatmentof large intestinal disorders such as constipation, coli-tis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bow-el disease (IBD), and others. 27-29 Thus far, available research has shown that the mecha-nism of this reciprocal treatment relationship includesthe promotion of intestinal movement, decreases in ab-dominal pressure, direct improvement of patients' re-spiratory function, the excretion of various intestinallytoxic substances, and an improvement in the microcir-culation metabolism. 30 Based on the facts above, we searched the clinical litera-ture published from 2008 to 2010, using frequency of lungsymptoms coincident with intestinal diseases, and viceversa. A total of 817 relevant articles were retrievedfrom the China Knowledge Resource Integrated data-base (CNKI), Chongqing VIP Information (CQVIP)database, and the MEDLINE database. The 817 arti-cles included 499 articles describing symptoms of intes-tinal diseases coincident with diseases of the lung, and318 articles describing symptoms of lung diseases coin-cident with intestinal disorders. From the search con-ducted it was clear that both TCM and Western medi-cine recognized the phenomenon of the lung beingpathologically related to the intestine.From the research above, it was found that in additionto the primary symptoms of lung and intestinal diseas-es, such as cough and asthma in the lung, and constipa-tion and diarrhea in the intestines, symptoms of intesti-nal diseases secondary to lung diseases such as constipa-tion, diarrhea, blood in stool, belching, and abdominalpain were observed (Table 1). Additionally, symptomsof lung diseases secondary to intestinal diseases such ascoughing, breathlessness, sputum, hemoptysis, and oth-er pulmonary symptoms were also observed (Table 2).These results show that it is necessary to consider therelationship between the lung and the intestine in thetreatment of lung and intestinal diseases. THETHEORYFROMTHEMODERN MEDICINEPOINTOFVIEW In recent years, studies have probed the relationship be- tween the lung and the large intestine from differentangles and aspects. It has been reported that the materi-al base of the theory may include body structure, endo-crine material, chemokines and proinflammatory endotox-ins. 31,32 Body structureSome studies have suggested that according to the bio-logical process of embryogenesis, most organs of the re-spiratory system and digestive system originate fromthe embryonic digestive tube. This common origin ofembryonic development, laid the phylogenic founda-tion for the inner link between the lung and the largeintestine. 33It may be that the common origin of embry- onic development formed the structural basis of thetheory. Excretion pathway of intestinal gas A study showed that intestinal gas is mainly absorbedin the circulation of the intestinal wall and is then ex-haled from the lung, and may be up to 20 times the amount of gas expelled from the rectum. If the lungsfail to remove the gas from the circulation, because ofpulmonary diseases such as pneumonia and bronchialasthma, it would adversely affect the excretion of gas-trointestinal gas. Therefore, cathartic and purgativetreatment may not only help intestinal function recov-er, but also lessen the burden of the lungs. 34 Endotoxins in the intestineIt has been found that endotoxins in the intestine canaccumulate and can be absorbed in the blood andcause damage to the lung. The endotoxins passthrough the inferior vena cava to the right heart andflow into the pulmonary artery, and the first organ tobe affected is the lung. Studies have also suggested thatintestinal infection can increase the level of endotoxinsand neutrophils in the lung and induce inflammatoryresponses. For these reasons, the level of endotoxin inthe intestine can signal early lung damage. 35 Immune systems of the mucosa of the gastrointestinal system and respiratory systemGastrointestinal and respiratory system mucosa play roles in immunity. It is generally considered that im-mune networks are likely mediating the mechanism ofthe relationship between the lung and large intestine.Mucous of the gastrointestinal immune system is muchmore complicated than other immune systems. The to-tal area of mucous in the human intestinal tract is ap-proximately 300 square meters, and mediates commu- nication between the internal and external environ-ment. Localized problems are communicated throughthe mucous immune system, which allows large area in-teractions to take place. For example, research indicatesthat both the gastrointestinal and respiratory tractshave a similar structure of mucous and secrete salivaryimmunoglobulin A (sIgA), which is one of the impor-tant molecules of mucous immune system. 36,37This sug- gests that sIgA signaling could allow the gastrointesti-nal and respiratory systems to interact with each other. 484JTCM|www.journaltcm.com September15,2012 |volume32 |Issue3|LiuPetal.StudyonTCMtheoryoflungbeingconnectedwithlargeintestine 17 36431413181320222638 30Blood in 4 11 9 26 10 873 12 8 17Belching 39 18 34 12 46 161520 17Abdominal pain 5 10 121110141015 9 1211 27Other symptoms stoolDiarrheaAbdominal intestinePulmonary tachypnea 31 9 181514 4 15Expectoration 2117 4 11 9 1015Hemoptysis 17 79 17 84 18Sweating, short of breath 12122113 656Other symptoms 18141315111017 CONCLUSION The study of the theory of lung being connected with large intestine has a long, rich history and is multi-di-rectional. In the last decade, many studies on the theo-retical meaning, biomedical mechanisms, and clinicalapplication of the theory that the lung and the large in-testine are interior-exteriorly linked have been made.Compared with modern medicine, studies in the fieldof TCM have paid increasing attention to the under-Neuroendocrine correlationsStudies have established that the lung is not merely a re-spiratory organ, but is also an endocrine organ. The re-lease of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) fromthe lung has a relaxation effect on the intestine. Con-versely, it has been shown that there are many endo-crine substances secreted by the intestine, such as calci-tonin gene-related (SP-A). 38,39 MicroecologyIt is has been shown that microorganisms inhabit thesurface of the mucous in the gastrointestinal and respi-ratory tracts. Enteric dysbacteriosis, induced by antibi-otics, is an important risk factor in the occurrence anddevelopment of allergic asthma. Moreover, applicationof microecological modulating agents has been shownto inhibit the generation of gastrointestinal gas and in-testinal endotoxins, promote the excretion of gas, andtherefore lighten the burden of the lung in discharginggas, and thus indirectly improved microcirculatory andpulmonary function. 40 485JTCM|www.journaltcm.com September15,2012 |volume32 |Issue3|LiuPetal.StudyonTCMtheoryoflungbeingconnectedwithlargeintestine standing of a disease as a whole from the view point of an interrelated and reciprocal relationship between thelung and the large intestine. In the present review, weanalyzed the theoretical origin, clinical application, andmaterial basis of the relationship between the large in-testine and the lung, to better explore the TCM inter-pretation of the theory. However, it is difficult to ob-tain a complete understanding of the theory over ashort time period. Further research is needed to contin-ue to reveal the biological foundations of the theory.
