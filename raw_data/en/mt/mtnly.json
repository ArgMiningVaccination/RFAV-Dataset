An estimated 15% of couples meet this criterion and are considered infertile. Half ofthese couples will have a component of male factor infertility andalmost 30% of infertility will be due solely to male factors. 1 Male conditions that affect fertility are still under-diagnosed and under-treated, as compared to female factor infertility. A completeevaluation is mandated for infertile men, which includes relevantmedical history, physical exam, and laboratory and imaging studies. 2 In general, causes of infertility in men can be explained by deficien-cies in ejaculate volume, sperm concentration (e.g., oligospermia,azoospermia), sperm motility, or sperm morphology. Male infertilitycan be due to anatomical abnormalities, endocrinopathies, or sys-temic disease. However, the clinician managing patients with maleinfertility often is frustrated by the limited therapeutic options avail-able, especially since in 40% of patients no cause for the infertilitycan be found. 3 After identifying abnormal parameters, the care of a subfertile male may depend on the desires of the affected couple, availableresources, local referral patterns, and the treatment style of theinvolved physician. Various treatments exist for the infertile male,ranging from optimizing the current semen parameters with medicaltherapy, to minor surgical procedures, and finally to complex spermretrieval and assisted reproduction techniques. Approximately one-third of infertile males seek non-conventional therapies for their ailment. 4In the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) setting, patients may be offered a variety of inter-ventions such as dietary manipulation, supplements, herbs, mind-body practices, or specific CAM modalities. 5,6Acupuncture is one of the most studied CAM modalities for male infertility.

There are six major patterns of qi(vital energy) disharmony that may manifest with male infertility.7The two most commonly involved organs in male infertilityaccording to TCM are the kidneys and liver. The kidneysstore essence qi, which roughly corresponds to the West- ern concept of male reproductive cells, while the liverstores blood and regulates the flow of qi, which are both fundamental for fertility. Traditionally, patients are categorized into their pat- tern of qidisharmony and treated accordingly with acupuncture and/or herbs. In addition, patients mayreceive lifestyle recommendations with regard to fre-quency of sexual activity, diet, exercise, and meditativepractices as stress reduction techniques. Within the paradigm of acupuncture, several approaches have evolved. Formulations of acupoints thathave been empirically and traditionally associated withfertility-boosting effects may be used in protocols for infertility treatments. These protocol-based acupunc-ture treatments do not attempt to address the underlyingqidisharmony. More recently, following the develop- ment of French auricular acupuncture therapy and itsendorsement in China, several protocols also combine auriculotherapy. Case Series Zongchang published a case series of 297 infertile males treated with various combinations of acupuncture,acupuncture point injections with Pilose Antler (a pow-der from the hairy, non-ossific, young horn of a stag),and Chinese herbs. 8Interventions were protocolized for acupuncture and point injections. Herbs were providedbased on a standard formula on top of which other herbswere added according to specific TCM patterns ofdisharmony. Patient population was heterogeneous forage, underlying infertility etiology, sperm motilityindices, and sperm count. Sperm morphology was notevaluated. Courses of acupuncture and point injectiontreatments were variable in length and were not wellcharacterized in the article. Within the time period ofeight treatment courses, approximately 50% of patientsachieved pregnancy, 27% achieved normal sperm countand motility, 18% improved sperm count but not spermmotility, and 7% had no change in the above outcomes.Highest rates of improvement were noticed in the groupthat received a combination of all three interventions\u2014herbs, acupuncture, and point injections. This study exemplifies the common practice of TCM for male infertility in China, in that several interventionsoften are used. Although this article documents veryhigh success rates, the methods used to report patientcharacteristics, treatments applied, and outcome meas-ures are not rigorous, which makes it difficult to drawconclusions. Controlled Clinical Trials In a single-blind controlled trial, 19 patients (24-42 years of age) with semen abnormalities in concentration,morphology, and/or motility, were randomized into twogroups. 9The protocolized acupuncture plus moxa (warming Artemisia vulgaris wool over acupuncture points), while the control groupwas needled in acupuncture points not known to haveany effect on infertility. Treatment was given twiceweekly for 10 weeks. Semen analyses were performedbefore and after the treatment course. Patients in thestudy group showed a significant increase in the percent-age of normal-form sperm compared to the controlgroup. However, there were no significant differencesbetween the two groups in sperm volume, concentration,or motility. Pregnancy outcomes were not mentioned inthe article. This study suggests that acupuncture canimprove sperm morphology, but not sperm activity orcount.

Therefore, one cannot project from this study how acupuncturemay affect the single most important outcome for infer-tile males\u2014successful fertilization of an egg. Siterman and colleagues conducted two randomized trials to assess the effect of acupuncture on the spermquality of males experiencing subfertility related tosperm impairment. In the first study, 16 males (average age 35 \u00b1 5 years) with subfertility associated with low sperm activityreceived acupuncture treatments twice weekly for fiveweeks. 10A group of acupuncture points with effects on fertility was predefined for this study. From this group ofpoints, the therapist selected specific points for individ-ual patients according to their pattern of disharmony.Semen was assessed one month pre- and post-treatmentin the acupuncture and the control group. Sixteenuntreated subfertile males, matched with the experimen-tal group for semen characteristics, served as a controlgroup. The fertility index, which serves as a validatedpredictor of fertility, increased significantly in theacupuncture group following improvement in total func-tional sperm fraction, percentage of viability, totalmotile spermatozoa per ejaculate, and integrity of theaxonema (structure of the sperm tail). Four (25%) spon-taneous pregnancies were achieved in the acupuncturegroup. In their second randomized trial, Siterman et al evalu- ated the effect of acupuncture treatment on sperm densi-ty. Semen samples of 20 males with previously diag-nosed azoospermia (the complete absence of sperm)were observed before and after acupuncture treatmentusing routine light microscope and special micro-scan-ning electron microscope examinations. These maleshad failed to achieve natural fertilization for an averageperiod of 9 \u00b1 4 years and none had undergone any treat-ment for at least one year prior to acupuncture. Age inboth acupuncture and control group averaged 39 \u00b1 7years. Following microscopy studies and endocrinologicevaluation, participants were categorized into three subgroups: 1. Patients (n = 6) with high follicle-stimulating hor- mone (FSH) and/or leutinizing hormone (LH) levelswithout any of genital tract inflammation, weredefined as suffering from spermatogenic failure. 2. Patients (n = 9) with normal basal blood FSH and LH levels, who exhibited signs of genital tract infectionaccording to the laboratory criteria, were defined as suf-fering from inflammation of the genital tract. 3. Patients (n = 5) who exhibited high FSH and/or LH levels as well as inflammation of the genital tract, weredefined as a combined subgroup of spermatogenic fail-ure and genital tract inflammation. Twenty males receiving no treatment with a matching andrological profile served as the control group.Acupuncture treatment was individualized according tothe TCM pattern of disharmony, and was administeredtwice weekly for five weeks. Following treatment, 13males exhibited a considerable improvement in spermdensity. Even the three males with the most severereduction in sperm count exhibited a marked but non-significant improvement in their sperm count (average0.7 \u00b1 1.1 \u00d710 6spermatozoa per ejaculate 4.3 \u00b1 3.2 \u00d7106spermatozoa per ejaculate after treatment). No effect was observed in the spermatogenicfailure patients (subgroup 1). Patients suffering fromgenital tract inflammation responded well to acupunc-ture treatment although levels of white blood cells andbacteria did not change following acupuncture treat-ment. Also noteworthy is that no changes in basal hor-monal blood levels were observed in any of the partici-pants of the experimental group. None of the untreatedcontrols exhibited any substantial changes in sperm den-sity. Only two of the 20 treated patients underwent invitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection(ICSI) following the acupuncture procedure. Pregnan-cies were achieved in both cases. These studies are important in that patients were well characterized for their sperm abnormality, and thatresearch methodology and outcome measures were ade-quate. Moreover, these studies, especially the latter, helpidentify infertility characteristics that are more amenableto acupuncture therapy. In summary, both sperm activityand sperm density were positively affected by acupunc-ture treatment. A study by Paulus and colleagues assessed the influ- ence of acupuncture on pregnancy rates in patients whoundergo assisted reproduction therapy. 11This study did not evaluate acupuncture's effectiveness on improvingsemen parameters but rather if acupuncture can improvepregnancy rates after ICSI. The severe male subfertilitygroup in this study was randomized to either acupunc-ture plus ICSI (n = 33) or ICSI only (n = 26). Eachfemale in the experimental group received a protocol-based body and ear acupuncture treatment. Acupuncturewas administered 25 minutes before and after embryotransfer. Pregnancy rates for the acupuncture group wereconsiderably higher than for the control group (42.5%vs. 26.3%; P = 0.03). A small case series echoes Paulus' results and describes better outcomes for ICSI with acupuncture interms of follicle yield and pregnancy rates. 12 The controlled trial and case series are important, since with a brief, safe, and inexpensive intervention Alternative Medicine Alert 39(acupuncture), it appears one can optimize the main out- come for a complex and highly expensive procedure. Mechanism of Action The possible mechanisms by which acupuncture improves sperm morphology and activity were notdirectly studied. However, several mechanisms weresuggested in the above articles. Acupuncture point stimulation may facilitate, through neuronally mediated mechanisms, vasodilatation to tes-ticular and epididymeal structures. Vasodilation to theseorgans may in turn reduce oxidative stress, which con-tributes to subfertility. 9 Acupuncture may also exert its effect via optimiza- tion of endocrine function. In at least one study,acupuncture was shown to cause a significant increase inbeta-endorphin. 13Beta-endorphins in turn affect GnRH secretion, which regulates the reproductive organs. Inaddition, acupuncture has been shown to normalize thehypothalamus-pituitary-reproductive organ axis. 14These hormonal effects may create a more favorable environ-ment for reproductive function. Moreover, emotional stress is an acknowledged factor that decreases fertility rates. 15Acupuncture can reduce anxiety and stress both through specific, non-specific,and placebo effects, thereby diminishing the stress com-ponent of couples seeking to conceive. 16 Safety MacPherson et al conducted a prospective postal audit of acupuncture treatments administered by 574professional acupuncturists who were members of theBritish Acupuncture Council. 17They found no serious adverse events after 34,407 acupuncture treatments. In2001, White et al reported prospective data from 78physicians and physiotherapists who administered31,822 acupuncture treatments. 18Altogether, only 43 significant events were reported, giving a rate of14/10,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8-20/10,000).All adverse events had cleared within one week, exceptfor one incident of pain that lasted two weeks and onereport of sensory symptoms that lasted several weeks.None of these events was serious. A total of 2,135 minorevents was reported, giving an incidence of 671/10,000(95% CI 42-1,013/10,000) consultations. The mostcommon events 49-247/10,000). Most recently, Melchart et al conducted a prospective investigation of adverse effects of acupuncture in 97,733patients receiving more than 760,000 acupuncture ses-sions. 19The mean (SD) number of inserted needles persession was 12.6 (\u00b1 5.1). Mild adverse effects were reported in 6,936 patients (7.10%, 99% CI 6.88%-7.32%). The most frequently reported adverse effectswere needling pain and hematoma. Comparison of thisadverse event rate for acupuncture with those of drugsroutinely prescribed in primary care suggests thatacupuncture is a safe form of treatment. 20 Conclusion Acupuncture has a long history in China of being an effective treatment for male infertility. Recent studiesconducted in Western countries assessing acupuncture'seffectiveness for this indication support those historicalobservations. Recommendation There is a paucity of methodologically sound studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment ofmale infertility. However, artificial reproductive tech-nologies are highly expensive and have limited effec-tiveness as well. In this setting, acupuncture with itsexcellent safety profile, low cost, and reported positiveoutcomes, may be recommended to patients with maleinfertility as part of an initial intervention or in conjunc-tion with conventional therapies.

Tai Chi for Anxiety and Depression By D\u00f3nal P. O'Math\u00fana, PhD THE SLOW GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS OF TAI CHI NOW REG - ularly show up in the backdrop of movies and TV shows. More and more tai chi classes are being offeredas a way to gently exercise the body and relax the mind.In addition, tai chi is said to have many general healthbenefits, primarily coming from the prevention of illnessrather than cure or relief of symptoms. Some claim itcan reduce blood pressure, cholesterol levels, tension,depression, fatigue, and anxiety. Others claim itimproves circulation, digestion, and appetite. It is also said to bring mental and spiritual clarity. Before recommending the practice, however, a closer examination of the growing number of clinical studies iswarranted. Although much of the focus on tai chi hasbeen on its potential to reduce falls among the elderly,the focus here will be on its psychological effects in thissame population, and specifically its impact on depres-sion and anxiety. 1 Background Tai chi, or tai chi chuan, literally means \"supreme ultimate power\" and is part of traditional Chinese medi-cine (TCM). It originally was developed to provide gen-eral physical fitness for the martial arts. 2However, the slow and smooth movements of tai chi now differ signif-icantly from the vigorous movements of judo, karate, ortae kwon do. Five major styles of tai chi developed overthe centuries, with the Yang form being the most popu-lar. 1A \"combined\" style developed from a meeting in China in 1956 and was designed to make the movementseasy to learn and practice in shorter periods of time. 2 The Chinese government promoted this form widely andmade it compulsory in most colleges and universities. Asa result, millions of Chinese people practice tai chitoday. Since the 1980s, it has also been growing in popu-larity in the West. All forms of tai chi involve meditation, breathing exercises, and slow, graceful movements. Each sessionis composed of a series of specific postures combinedinto one long exercise. The movements are all consid-ered circular with each session being viewed as one con-tinuous, integrated circle. 2Within each session, howev- er, there are many variations and changes. Sessionscome in short and long versions, lasting either 10 or 30minutes. Mechanism of Action As with all aspects of TCM, the traditional purpose of tai chi is to restore a balanced flow of qi(or chi) and thereby promote health. Qiis a nonphysical \"life energy\" that is believed to pervade and animate the universe. Illness is held to be a manifestation of imbal-ances or poor flow of qi. Tai chi movements are viewed as part of a healthy lifestyle that promotes a more bal-anced flow of qi. Practicing tai chi outdoors is said to be better because it allows universal qiin the earth to rise up through one's feet to replenish the person's ownqi. More biological or scientific mechanisms of action have not been established for tai chi, other than viewingit as a gentle form of exercise and \"meditation inmotion.\" Alternative Medicine Alert 41Clinical Studies One of the earliest studies of tai chi in the West found reduced tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion,and state-anxiety when comparing pre- and post-studyscores among 33 beginners and 33 experienced tai chipractitioners. 3This study was neither controlled nor blinded. The same researcher did a similarly uncon-trolled study to compare the psychological benefits of taichi to those of brisk walking, meditation, and reading. 4 After 3-4 years, all four regimens were equivalent inreducing mood disturbances, and the stress-reductioneffects of tai chi and brisk walking were comparable.Another nonrandomized controlled trial involved 90subjects using tai chi for 30 minutes daily, six days aweek, for one month. 5At the end of the trial, those prac- ticing tai chi had reduced stress and anxiety, andimproved overall psychological symptoms. The first randomized controlled trial examining psy- chological effects involved 135 subjects (average age 51years). 6These were randomly assigned to one of five groups: tai chi, control, moderate-intensity walking,low-intensity walking, or low-intensity walking plusrelaxation response. Each was practiced for 45 minutes,three times per week for 16 weeks. No significant differ-ences were found among the five groups on measures ofmood, self-esteem, personality, or life satisfaction. How-ever, sub-group analysis did find that women in the taichi group experienced significant reductions in mooddisturbance (P < 0.006) and improvements in generalmood (P < 0.04). Another controlled trial involved 98 healthy sub- jects (average age 73 years) who were not involved in any structured exercise program in the previousmonth. 7They were randomly assigned to either the con- trol group or to practice tai chi for one hour, twice aweek, for six months. At that point, the tai chi groupshowed significantly greater reductions in depression,negative affect, and psychological distress and greaterincreases in positive affect and well-being, life satisfac-tion, and health perception compared to the controlgroup (P < 0.05). The third randomized controlled trial of tai chi in this area was conducted with 14 patients (average age 73years) diagnosed with depression of a non-organicnature. 8None of the participants had been involved in regular exercise for the previous six months, and nonehad a medical contraindication to exercise. The subjectswere randomly assigned to either a group that participat-ed in three tai chi sessions per week for three months, orto a waiting group. According to their scores on the Chi-nese version of the Center for Epidemiology StudiesDepression Scale, the tai chi group showed statisticallysignificant improvements compared to the control group (P < 0.05). A multivariate analysis of subcategories ofdepressive symptoms (somatic, negative affect, interper-sonal, and well-being) showed significant improvementsin all four categories (P < 0.05). Adverse Effects No adverse effects of tai chi were reported in the literature examined. Although Western medicine ques-tions the existence of qi, tai chi can be practiced without any reference to, or in support of, any particular beliefsystem. Conclusion Few rigorously controlled trials examine the impact of tai chi on depression or anxiety. Some of the trialshave not been randomized and sometimes the outcomesreported were not clearly defined. All but the last trialexamined above involved healthy subjects rather thanthose diagnosed with depression or anxiety. In spite ofthese limitations, the results have generally been sup-portive of tai chi's ability to improve mood and reduceanxiety among the elderly. Whether this is the result of ageneralized benefit from moderate exercise, or specifi-cally related to the combination of exercise, meditation,and breathing aspects of tai chi, cannot be clearly deter-mined from the currently available trials. However, whatevidence is available suggests that tai chi, as a result ofits meditative and breathing dimensions, may providebenefits that go beyond those of exercise. The gentlenature of tai chi makes it particularly suited for elderlyadults. Recommendation Those interested in becoming more active could consider tai chi as one option that may bring accom-panying psychological and well-being benefits. Alladults, especially the elderly, who are considering starting an exercise program should seek out medicaladvice to ensure they are physically ready to do so. Doctors and others examining such people should seek details on the precise nature of the tai chi programas the duration and rigor can vary considerably. Patientsshould be made aware of what symptoms to watch outfor that would indicate overexertion. Keeping such cau-tions in mind, people can be advised that tai chi maybring the psychological benefits established for exercisealong with possible benefits from \"meditation inmotion.\" Dr. O'Math\u00fana is a lecturer in Health Care Ethics at the School of Nursing, Dublin City University, Ireland. 42 April 2005References 1.

Peppermint Oil for Irritable Bowel Syndrome By David Kiefer, MD THIS COMMON AND FLA VORFUL MEMBER OF THE MINT family has many well-proven uses that extend beyond simply being the tasty after-dinner candy. Pep-permint ( Mentha x piperita ), in leaf form, essential oil extract, or as its primary purified compound, menthol,has been used in a variety of gastrointestinal, biliary, andupper respiratory conditions in the pharmacopeia ofmany cultures around the world. In addition, there arenow many interesting in vitro and clinical research stud-ies refining what we know about its mechanism ofaction and clinical availability. History and Traditional Use Plants in the mint family, including peppermint ( Men- ), have a history of culinary and medicinal use dating back toGreek and Roman times, ancient Egypt, and 13th centu-ry Iceland, with general use in Western Europe begin- ning in the 18th century. 1Peppermint leaf tea was well- known to act as a digestive aid in cases of dyspepsia, toincrease bile production, and was used as an inhalant toclear upper respiratory symptoms, as well as to relievethe cough of bronchitis and pneumonia. 1,2 Topically, peppermint oil has been used as an anal- gesic for headache. In more recent times, preparations ofthe oil are prescribed for systemic use in functional gas-trointestinal disorders, intestinal spasm, and irritablebowel syndrome (IBS). Peppermint is a plant known to many cultures around the world and, as such, has a variety of common names,including brandy mint, lamb mint, Pfefferminze andKatzenkraut (German), 1,2. Botany and Pharmacology Peppermint is an herbaceous perennial in the genus Mentha , in the family Lamiaceae (also called Labiatae), a family that includes other common aromatic plantssuch as basil, sage, and oregano. Peppermint has stemsthat are square in cross-section, a common characteristicof this family. Peppermint is a hybrid of spearmint(Mentha spicata ) and water mint ( Mentha aquatica ), is expressed with an \"x\" its scientific name,Mentha x piperita . The fresh, above-ground parts of Mentha x piperita are distilled to yield peppermint oil. 1The resulting oil contains numerous compounds, including cineole (6-8%), and othervolatile oils. 1,3 Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS is a clinical entity that includes a group of func- tional bowel disorders with chronic, intermittent, or con-tinuous abdominal complaints or abnormal bowelhabits, which are specifically defined by, most currently,the Rome II Diagnostic Criteria. 4Patients with IBS usu- ally can be described as having one of three IBS sub-groups: constipation-predominant, diarrhea-predomi-nant, or alternating IBS. 5Treatments may be most effec- tive when based on these IBS sub-types.6,7In like man- ner, it is important to keep these characteristics in mindwhen interpreting the research behind the use of pepper-mint oil in IBS. Mechanism of Action The use of peppermint oil in IBS stems from several proposed mechanisms of action. Peppermint oil hasbeen shown to reduce gastric motility 8by directly acting on gut calcium channels to relax gastrointestinal smooth Alternative Medicine Alert 43muscle, similar to the actions of dihydropyridine calci- um antagonists.9A recent review of peppermint oil sup- ports in vitro research showing that peppermint oilrelaxes animal and human gastrointestinal smooth mus-cle, and that menthol has two distinct calcium-antago-nistic activities. 3 Peppermint oil also is known to relax the lower esophageal sphincter, which can lead to symptoms ofheartburn after oral administration. For this reason, sev-eral manufacturers have developed enteric-coated prepa-rations, delivering the peppermint oil to the small bowel,allowing its effects to focus on the area of the gastroin-testinal tract most relevant in cases of IBS. Theseenteric-coated preparations are those that have beenstudied for their effects in IBS in the clinical trials dis-cussed below. Clinical Studies Peppermint oil has been used for the treatment of IBS for at least three decades. 10,11Recent reviews have addressed the quality of the current clinical evidence forits therapeutic benefits, 3,12generally concluding that the efficacy of peppermint oil in IBS has not clearly beenestablished. These opinions are based on the few pub-lished clinical research trials, notable for their varyingresults and methodological quality. For example, in a randomized, double-blind con- trolled trial in 42 children, enteric-coated peppermint oilcapsules (Colpermin capsules, 0.2 mL [187 mg], three times daily before meals; patients 30-45 kg received 0.1mL three times daily) significantly reduced abdominalpain in acute IBS, though there was little effect on theother symptoms of IBS. 13 This is in agreement with one study of 29 adults that showed enteric-coated peppermint oil (Elanco LOK capsules, 0.2-0.4 mL three times daily) to be superior toplacebo in the treatment of IBS abdominal symptoms, 14 but contrary to another trial (n = 41 adults) that found nosignificant difference between peppermint oil (Colper-min capsules, 0.4 mL [374 mg] three times daily) andplacebo for IBS abdominal pain. 15To further complicate assessment, one prospective, randomized, double-blindtrial (n = 110) compared enteric-coated peppermint oil(Colpermin capsules, 0.2 mL [187 mg] 3-4 times dailybefore meals) to placebo for four weeks, demonstratingstatistically significant improvements in abdominal pain,abdominal distension, stool frequency, and flatulence inthe peppermint oil group. 16 Some of the methodological problems in the pub- lished literature include short treatment duration (usual-ly 6 weeks), small sample size, and failure to use established IBS criteria in inclusion criteria. Proprietary blends are also occasionally mentioned in the medical literature, offshoots of some of the peppermint oil research. For example, 90 mg pepper-mint oil and 50 mg caraway oil (called Enteroplant ), has been studied in functional dyspepsia,17,18and may affect gastrointestinal motility in healthy volunteers.19 These are interesting results, but difficult to apply direct-ly to IBS. Dosages and Forms Enteric-coated preparations are preferred for the treatment of IBS to prevent upper gastrointestinal sideeffects and to deliver the herb to the desired site ofaction. The daily dose is 0.6 mL of peppermint oil inenteric-coated tablets or capsules, often dosed as a 0.2mL of peppermint oil in a capsule or tablet three timesdaily before food. 1,2 Adverse Effects, Contraindications,and Drug Interactions Peppermint oil is contraindicated in certain clinical situations, such as pregnancy, because it may cause theonset of menstruation; cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, dueto its activity the of bile; andhiatal hernia or gastroesophageal reflux disease, becauseof lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. 20With pepper- mint tea, one study in rats points to a possible effect onthe cytochrome P450 system, specifically by CYP1A2, 21though the med- ical literature does not mention a problem with humanenzyme systems. Conclusion Peppermint ( Mentha x piperita ) has a long history of use for digestive disorders, and there is both clinicaland in vitro research on the whole plant and one of itsmain phytochemicals, menthol, to support some of itstraditional uses. Peppermint oil acts to reduce gastro-intestinal smooth muscle motility by acting as a calciumantagonist. There are both positive and negative clinicaltrials for the use of peppermint oil in IBS, and someexperts state that no conclusions can be drawn from the medical literature, mainly because of poor researchmethodology. Peppermint oil is dosed at 0.2 mL of peppermint oil per capsule or tablet, three times dailybefore meals, and it is contraindicated in pregnancy,gall bladder disorders, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Recommendation As with many herbal medicines, high-quality research is needed to definitively prove the efficacy of 44 April 2005peppermint oil in IBS. Future studies should use the Rome II Diagnostic Criteria as inclusion criteria, dividetreatment trials into IBS sub-types, be of longer dura-tion, and use uniform dosing and herbal formulations.Despite these limitations, there are some positiveresearch trials and well-documented effects via calcium antagonism on gastrointestinal smooth muscle,intriguing results especially for a clinical entity such asIBS where conventional treatments are not always suc-cessful. Provided peppermint oil is not contraindicated,the use of an enteric-coated preparation could be consid-ered for a trial in patients with IBS until further researchis undertaken to refine clinical use.

Acute treatment of moderate to severe depression with hyper-icum extract WS 5570 (St. John's paroxetine. BMJ Goal: To evaluate the efficacy of a stan- dardized extract of St John's wort formoderate-to-severe with single orrecurrent acute unipolar major depres-sion persisting for two weeks to oneyear recruited from 21 German psychi-atric primary care centers (data avail-able for analysis on 188 subjects). Sub-jects had to score 22 on the Hamilton depression scale and 2 points on the item for \"depressive mood.\" Methods: Subjects underwent a single- blind placebo run-in phase of 3-7 daysduring which time they received three placebo tablets of hypericum and one ofparoxetine. They were then randomizedto six weeks of either 900 mg hyper-icum (standardized to 3-6% hyperforinand 0.12-0.28% hypericin) or 20 mgparoxetine daily plus an identicallymatched placebo for the other agent(i.e., three tablets of hypericum plusplacebo paroxetine capsule or one cap-sule of paroxetine plus three placebohypericum tablets). If at least 20%improvement in total depression scorewas not noted after two weeks of treat-ment, doses were increased to either1,800 mg hypericum or 40 mg paroxe-tine daily. Primary outcome measurewas decrease in Hamilton depressionscore after six weeks compared to base-line. Secondary outcome measuresincluded results of the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale, clinicalglobal impressions, and the Beckdepression inventory. Assessments were made at baseline and at 4 and 6weeks. Results: Compared to baseline values, by day 42 Hamilton depression scoreshad decreased by 57% in the hypericumgroup and by 45% in the paroxetinegroup. Those patients who wereswitched to higher dosages at week 2 showed significant responses duringweeks 3-6. Regardless of dose, substan-tial symptom relief was achieved withtreatment in each group. Statisticalanalysis of validated rating scalesshowed the hypericum extract to besuperior to paroxetine at almost all ofthe centers. The number adverseevents higher for paroxetine hypericum Six weeks WS 5570 is at least as effectiveas paroxetine the treatment of adultswith moderate-to-severe major unipolardepression. Study strengths: Method of blinding; use of multiple validated rating tools;comparison to standard form of therapy. Study weaknesses: All participants were Caucasian, limiting generalizabili-ty; assessment of compliance (countingtablets); short duration of trial; three-quarters of the authors have ties to themanufacturer of the hypericum extractutilized. Of note: Participants were not allowed to use other psychotropic agents orAlternative Medicine Alert 47engage in psychotherapy during the trial; all assessments were made by psychiatrists and psychologists familiarwith the protocol; mean age and averageduration of episode were higher in thehypericum group; more than half theparticipants in each group were severelydepressed; after two weeks, 57% ofthose in the hypericum group and 48%in the switchedto group; two seriouscomplications occurred in the hyper-icum group, though they were felt to be unrelated to the agent (one hyperten-sive crisis, one psychotic decompensa-tion due to social problems); there wasno increase in adverse effects with higher dosages of the agents, includingphotosensitivity; an ongoing continua-tion phase will be reported at a laterdate. We knew that: Therapeutic effective- ness of St. John's wort for severe majordepression has been in doubt; standard-ized extracts of St. John's wort havebeen shown effective in treating mild-to-moderate depression, and to be aseffective as fluoxetine and some antide-pressants in this regard; a placebo con-trol was not used for these severelydepressed patients for ethical reasons;St. John's wort has been reported tolower levels of pharmaceu-tical or complementa-ry modalities, industry involvement inresearch is a given in today's environ-ment. While it is cause for especiallycareful assessment before drawing con-clusions, as well as for investigation byother centers, industry involvementalone does not nullify positive results.At a time when the benefits of antide-pressant therapy are being challengedby fears of frightening side effects (i.e.,increased suicide risk), practitioners andpatients alike are likely to seek out safealternatives. A single trial of short dura-tion, in a clinical situation where place-bos have also been reported to offer sig-nificant benefit, is not sufficient to man- date change in the long-term manage-ment of depression. Potential drug inter-actions do loom large when consideringthe use of hypericum. However, thestudy is clean, and the results com-pelling enough to open the possibilitythat St. John's wort may be a viableoption for those with major depression,a clinical recommendation that previ-ously would have been cause for alarmin many professional circles.

Chromium supple- mentation does not improve glucose toler-ance, insulin sensitivity, or lipid profile. Dia- betes Care 2005;3:712-713. Goal: To determine the effect of sup- plementation with chromium picolinateon glucose tolerance, insulin resistance,and lipid in people with impairedglucose tolerance. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects: Forty subjects (24 females) with proven impaired glucose tolerancerecruited from tertiary referral centers inSydney, Australia. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either chromium picolinate400 \u00b5g twice daily or placebo over three months. Fasting levels of insulin,chromium, cholesterol, and triglycerideswere determined prior to intervention. Results: At trial's end the only differ- ences noted were a small increase inserum chromium levels in the activegroup and a small rise in cholesterol lev-els in the placebo group. Conclusions: Chromium supplementa- tion offers no significant benefit to peo-ple with impaired glucose tolerance. Study strengths: Although the samplesize was small, the study was sufficient- ly powered to identify clinically rele-vant differences between treatmentarms. Study weaknesses: Compliance assessed by tablet count; 800 \u00b5g/d is a higher dose than used in some studies,but it is nonetheless a lower dose thanwhat is commonly used in clinical prac-tice (1,000 \u00b5g daily). Of note: An estimated 10 million Americans use chromium supplements,making them the second most popularnutritional supplement; dietary require-ments for chromium are controversial,and the present RDA is 0.05-0.20 \u00b5g; while many studies of chromium for thetreatment of diabetes have been pub-lished, results have been inconsistent;subjects were asked not to use chromi-um supplementation outside the studyparameters. We knew that: The association between chromium deficiency anddevelopment of diabetes was first notedin patients receiving long-term parenter-al nutrition (diabetes resolved followingchromium supplementation, andchromium is now routinely added toTPN solutions); the most appropriatebiomarker of adequate chromium statushas yet to be identified; chromium isfound in many foods including wheatgerm, brewer's yeast, many meats, anda number of vegetables; chromium touted as a weight-loss/body-building supplement with little support-ive research; one published study sug-gested that chromium picolinate cancause DNA damage (likely due to thepicolinate moiety), but this has not beenshown to be true in humans. Clinical import: With a seemingly ever-increasing incidence of Type 2 dia-betes, patients are exploring a wide vari-ety of supplements, especially chromi-um, to help control the malady and limitcomplications. This small, but adequate-ly powered, study showed no significantbenefit attributable to a moderate doseof chromium picolinate in people withimpaired glucose tolerance. Results ofstudies on chromium for the treatmentof diabetes and dyslipidemia have beeninconsistent, the dosages used have often not approximated the dosageemployed clinically (true even for thepresent study), and good data are scarcefor weight loss and other advertisedindications. Unfortunately, a reliablenormal range for chromium levels hasnot yet been established, and it is possi-ble that supplementation may benefitthose patients with Type 2 diabetes whoare also chromium-deficient. For thoseusing chromium, the picolinate form is perhaps the most popular, but manypractitioners steer their patients to GTF (glucose tolerance factor) chromi-um in part because of the concernsraised about picolinic acid in the singlelaboratory study cited above. That stat-ed, the data supporting supplementationwith magnesium in the setting of in-sulin resistance/diabetes appear moreconvincing. What to do with this article: Keep a copy on your computer. Life Expectancy and the 21st Century Source: Olshansky SJ, et al. A potential decline in life expectancy in the UnitedStates in the 21st century. N Engl J Med 2005;352:1138-1145. Goal: To calculate the effect of current trends in obesity in the United States onlife expectancy. Design: Mathematical analysis. Methods: The authors calculated the reduction in death rates in the UnitedStates if all Americans who currentlyare obese were to lose enough weight tomeet criteria for having a normal bodymass index, or BMI (24%). Data usedfor the calculations were taken from theThird National Health and NutritionExamination Survey and the NationalCenter for Health Statistics. Calcula-tions included probability of death forthe non-obese population and obesity-adjusted conditional probability ofdeath.Results: If obesity were completely eradicated, life expectancy at birth couldrise by almost one year across racial andsexual categories. Should the currentdeath rate associated with obesityremain constant, obesity would lowerlife expectancy by 4-9 months (morethan the negative impact of all acciden-tal deaths combined). Should trends inobesity prevalence and associated ill-nesses continue, the negative impact onlife expectancy could increase to 2-5years, approaching or exceeding that ofcardiovascular disease or cancer. Conclusion: Life expectancy at birth and at older ages could level off or evendecline within the next few decadesgiven the present trends in obesity. Theyouth of today may live less healthy andshorter lives than their parents. Study strengths: Calculations and background data are based on firm statistics that have been repeatedly verified. Of note: Human life expectancy has been slowly increasing over the past1,000 years, with valleys due to infec-tious disease, epidemics/pandemics,famines, and war, and peaks in responseto technological advances, improvedliving conditions, and advances in pub-lic health; most predictions of future lifeexpectancy are based upon historicaltrends that do not take into account thecurrent health status of the population;the largest increases in obesity haveoccurred among children and minori-ties, populations for whom primarymedical care often is woefully inade-quate; one prior study noted that obesitycauses 300,000 deaths per year; the life-time risk of diabetes for people born inthe United States is now 30-40%, themean age of onset of diabetes hasdecreased dramatically, and diabetesshortens lifespan by almost 13 years onaverage. We knew that: Last year the Social Security Administration projected lifeexpectancy in the United States to reachclose to 85 years sometime this century,while other experts believe this estimateto be too conservative; a 2004 UnitedNations report predicted that in most countries of the world men and womencould expect to live until age 100 yearsby 2300; observed trends in obesity inthe United States continue to worsen,with prevalence increasing by 50%through both the 1980s and 1990s; > 60% of U.S. adults are overweight orobese, with 28% of men, 34% ofwomen, and almost 50% of non-His-panic black women meeting criteria forobesity; the increase in rates of obesitycrosses all racial and socioeconomicstrata; obesity increases the risk fornumerous illnesses including diabetes,cardiovascular disease, and cancer;infection with antibiotic-resistant organ-isms, increased exposure to environ-mental pollution, and smoking could allfurther adversely impact future lifeexpectancy. Comments: This space is typically reserved for clinical trials that mayimpact the way we care for our patients,yet this recently published special reportshould spur us to action more than anysingle randomized controlled trialcould. The information for this review was culled directly from the article, andthere are many more statistics in thepiece that can leaves one's mouthagape. There's little need to seriouslyconsider weaknesses in the study as themath is clear. The information con-tained herein serves notice to we healthcare professionals that the time foraction is long overdue. We must act individually and collec- tively on behalf of our patients (and our-selves), on both local and national lev-els, to ensure access to healthy fare, topromote additional physical educationin schools, and to support more researchinto behavior modification and appro-priate weight management. The politicalramifications of these data are likewiseprofound. As the authors point out, \"theU.S. population may be inadvertentlysaving Social Security by becomingmore obese.\" Finally, a political stanceno one could reasonably take.

Although nearly half of all infertile couples have some component of male infertility, only 30% of cases are a result of male infertility alone. Female infertilitymay be a result of anovulation, pelvic factors such as adhesions and tubal occlusion, and cer-vical factors. It usually is the female partner who presents initially for an infertility problem, often in the context of an annual well-women examination. In this situation, the primary care providermay initiate certain diagnostic and treatment options. Given the expense and invasive natureof many conventional treatment options for infertility, complementary and alternative thera-pies such as acupuncture have begun to receive more attention from physicians and patients.Although there remains a paucity of clinical research in this area, the relative safety ofacupuncture makes it a reasonable option as part of an initial intervention or in conjunctionwith conventional therapies. Mechanism of Action The mechanisms of action by which acupuncture may treat female infertility have not been elucidated. One possible mechanism is via hormonal regulation, with acupuncture regulating a dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Another mechanism might beimprovement in uterine blood flow, which increases the receptivity of the endometrium to afertilized egg. Human Female Studies\u2014Treatment Infertile patients may seek assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Successful IVF depends on adequate endometrial receptivity. Acupuncture has beendemonstrated to improve uterine blood flow impedance, which is a measurement of bloodflow to the uterus. It has been considered valuable in assessing endometrial receptivity. 1Ten subjects with a high pulsatility index, a measurement made using Doppler transvaginal ultra-sound, were treated with twice weekly acupuncture for the month prior to embryo transfer. Ahigh pulsatility index is evidence of decreased uterine artery blood flow. Pulsatility indexdecreased both at the time of the embryo transfer and again at follow-up approximately twoweeks later. The authors suggest that the effects arise from a central inhibition of the sympa-thetic activity. Acupuncture also has been studied as analgesia during infertility treatment. A randomized controlled trial compared acupuncture to alfentanil as anesthesia for oocyte aspiration duringIVF. 2One hundred fifty women participated in this study. The acupuncture group experi- enced discomfort for a longer period of time during oocyte aspiration, but no differencesbetween the groups were noted by visual analog scale, adequacy of anesthesia during aspira-tion, abdominal pain suffered, or degree of nausea. Surprisingly, the acupuncture group had astatistically significantly higher implantation rate, pregnancy rate, and take home baby rateEXECUTIVE EDITOR Russell H.

Compared the alfentanil group, the electroacupuncture group's implantation ratewas 27.2% vs. 16.3%; pregnancy rate was 45.9% vs.28.3%; and take home baby rate was 41% vs. 19.4% perembryo transfer. The same authors are conducting alarger study to corroborate these findings. A large fibroid may cause infertility. One case report presented a patient with a 13 x 8 x 10 cm fibroid uteruswho had secondary infertility, unresponsive to \"repeat-ed\" cycles of IVF. 3The exact number of IVF cycles was not reported. This patient underwent acupuncture treat-ment and her uterus decreased to 7 x 8 x 8 cm, afterwhich she had successful IVF and delivered healthytwins. The studies cited above all used body points, but auricular (or ear) acupuncture also has been used to treatfemale infertility. 4Forty-five infertile women with either oligomenorrhea or luteal insufficiency were treated withauricular acupuncture. Results of treatment were thencompared with matched subjects who were treated withhormones. Pregnancy rate was similar for both groups,whereas side effects were observed only in the hormonegroup. However, the groups were not equal even thoughthey were matched on several criteria. The authors con-clude that auricular acupuncture seems to offer a valu-able alternative therapy for female infertility from hor-mone disorders. However, lack of randomization anddifferences between the groups limit the ability to makethis conclusion. Human Female Studies\u2014Hormone Levels Chinese investigators studied 10 anovulatory women and five women with normal menstrual cycles. 5Subjects were treated with electroacupuncture for 30 min/d forthree days per month for 13 cycles. Changes in bloodhormone concentration were measured. Beta-endorphin,LH, and follicle-stimulating (FSH) normalized in thosewho ovulated but did not change in those who did notovulate. However, the determination of ovulation wasnot described, and other important methodologicaldetails are missing. Another Chinese study was equally difficult to inter- pret. 6Thirty-four subjects with amenorrhea and dys- functional uterine bleeding received acupuncture threetimes per week for three months. The terms that theauthors use are unclear. Criteria for the efficacy of thera-py for inducing ovulation were defined as markedlyeffective, effective, or ineffective, based on ultrasound, basal body temperature, and presence or absence ofmenstruation. Thirty-five percent, 48%, and 18% weremarkedly effective, effective, and ineffective, respective-ly. An endocrine profile was performed in 20 subjectsbefore and after treatment. FSH, LH, and estradiol nor-malized compared to pre-acupuncture values. However,the time during the menstrual cycle at which the bloodwas drawn was not stated; different timing could greatlyskew these results. Safety Several prospective investigations of the adverse effects associated with acupuncture have supported itsrelative safety. 7-9The most frequently reported adverse effects were needling pain and hematoma.
