Our team in San Diego include doctors with specialized training and years of experience in naturopathic oncology. Naturopathic Oncology \"is the application of the art and science of naturopathic medicine to the field of cancer care and treatment.\" Our goal is to offer scientifically proven natural cancer care to ensure optimal quality of life, augment and support patients going through conventional treatment, strengthen the immune system and enhance the body's inherent ability to fight the cancer, along with preventing occurrence and recurrence of cancer. Our Cancer Treatments and Services As Naturopathic Doctors we treat the whole person and our integrative medical care model include natural non-toxic therapies administered either orally and/or intravenously, nutritional and other lifestyle guidance, managing stress, emotional support and help in developing the patient's spiritual toolbox in enhancing health and well-being. We strive to ensure that all aspects of the patient's health are being addressed. Cancer can only develop in the body if it has the right terrain to do so. Our therapies are geared towards changing the internal and external milieu so that tumor cells no longer have the ability to thrive. Integrative Cancer Care and Conventional Medicine We encourage collaboration and open communication with oncologists and other conventional health professionals to coordinate care and treatment so that optimal effects of both natural and conventional modalities may be achieved. One of the fundamental integrative oncology treatments we provide our patients are nutriceuticals, designed specifically to minimize the side effects of chemotherapy. Many natural therapies synergestically enhance the effects of conventional treatment, thus allowing reduction of tumor growth to be achieved more quickly and with fewer side effects. Once our patient has become a \"Cancer Conqueror,\" our goal is to support the patient in maintaining a life-style which encourages maintaining health and ensuring that the internal terrain does not support growth of aberrant cells. In addition, it has been shown that even though cancer has become the primary cause of death in Northern America and is reaching epidemic proportions, many cancers are actually preventable. At LotusRain we have the immense joy of having many \"Cancer Conquerors\" years out whom partnered with us after being diagnosed with Stage 4 and told they had months or weeks to live!! Our therapies are geared to addressing factors which may lead to the development of cancer such as acidity, oxidative stress, internal inflammation, insulin resistance-metabolic syndrome, lack of physical activity, heavy metal toxic load and psychological and spiritual inflammation. The earlier these factors are addressed in the body, the more preventable cancer is. Part of our goals therefore is to identify these and other risk factors in all patients who come to us and are interested in reducing chances of developing the disease. The focus is on creating an external and internal healthy environment, along with using safe natural therapies to strengthen the body's immune system and inherent natural ability to heal itself. Cancer Is Preventable In addition, it has been shown that even though cancer is reaching epidemic proportions, many cancers are preventable. The earlier the inflammatory factors are addressed in the body, the more preventable cancer is. Part of our goals therefore is to identify the sources of inflammation, minimize exposure, and address all risk factors in our patients who partner with us. The focus is on creating an external and internal healthy environment and to use safe natural therapies to strengthen the body's immune system and inherent natural ability to heal itself. "}
