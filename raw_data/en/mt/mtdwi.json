Landscape and climatic characteristics associated with human alveolar echinococcosis in France, 1982 to 2007. Euro Surveill. 2015;20(18):pii=21118. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21118 Article submitted on 15 March 2014 / published on 07 May 2015 Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a severe hepatic disease caused by Echinococcus multilocula - ris. In France, the definitive and intermediate hosts of E. multilocularis (foxes and rodents, respectively) have a broader geographical distribution than that of human AE. In this two-part study, we describe the link between AE incidence in France between 1982 and 2007 and climatic and landscape characteris - tics. National-level analysis demonstrated a dramatic increase in AE risk in areas with very cold winters and high annual rainfall levels. Notably, 52% (207/401) of cases resided in French communes (smallest French administrative level) with a mountain climate. The mountain climate communes displayed a 133-fold (95% CI: 95-191) increase in AE risk compared with com - munes in which the majority of the population resides. A case-control study performed in the most affected areas confirmed the link between AE risk and climatic factors. This arm of the study also revealed that popu - lations residing in forest or pasture areas were at high risk of developing AE. We therefore hypothesised that snow-covered ground may facilitate predators to track their prey, thus increasing E. multilocularis biomass in foxes. Such climatic and landscape conditions could lead to an increased risk of developing AE among humans residing in nearby areas. Introduction Echinococcus multilocularis is a cestode parasite that exhibits a dixenic life cycle involving circula - tion between canids and rodents. In France, the E. multilocularis sylvatic life cycle involves foxes (the main definitive host) and rodents such as Arvicola ter - Ondatra zibethi cus (the main intermediate hosts). Humans represent an aberrant host of the parasite, although they some - times become infected with E. multilocularis larvae after ingesting parasite oncospheres. When E. infects humans, E. multilocularis metaces - tode cells proliferate in the liver and eventually lead to alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a rare but severe hepatic disease resembling a slow-growing liver cancer [1]. A study by the EurEchinoReg network showed that 235 of 559 (42%) European AE cases reported from 1982 to 2000 were observed in France [2]. Since 2000, the French registry of human AE cases has been maintained by the FrancEchino network. In total, 407 human cases were identified from 1982 to 2007 [3]. In France, for this period, high-risk areas included the Massif Central and north-eastern regions of the country (Figure 1), where most cases either resided in rural communes (small - est French administrative level) or resided in towns but worked as farmers or tended gardens [3]. Although behavioural [3-8] and genetic [9-11] elements have been identified as risk factors of human AE, they largely fail to explain the geographical distribution of the disease. For instance, in China, specific land - scapes, such as alpine meadows, are associated with an increased prevalence of human AE [8,12]. In Europe and especially in France, an increase in the proportion of grassland is associated with vole density outbreaks. 3 www.eurosurveillance.orgDietary specialisation has been described in foxes dur - ing these outbreaks leading to an increase in the bur - den of E. multilocularis in foxes [13-15]. Nevertheless, human AE case distribution does not correlate with that of grasslands, foxes or rodents. In particular, human AE is very rarely diagnosed in western France, despite the apparent presence of favourable trans - mission factors regarding landscapes and hosts [13]. Thus, the key environmental and geographical factors associated with human AE transmission remain poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesised that the completion of the sylvatic life cycle and transmission of the para - site from the animal hosts to humans depend on the climatic and landscape conditions. We first assessed the association between human AE cases and environ - mental data at a national scale in France. In the French regions with the highest AE incidence rates, we then compared the habitat environment of AE cases with that of randomly selected residences at a local scale.Methods This study included all AE cases diagnosed in France from 1982 to 2007. The analyses were performed in two parts. First, at the national level, we assessed AE cumulative incidence in each commune, considering several demographic and environmental variables (e.g. elevation, landscape and climate). France is divided into five nested administrative levels (listed from larg - est to smallest geographical divisions: r\u00e9gions, d\u00e9par - arrondissements, cantons and communes). Second, we conducted a case-control study in the nine most affected French d\u00e9partements to compare case habitats (in terms of elevation, landscape and climate) with randomly selected control habitats at various buffer sizes (i.e. circular areas centred over each habi - tat with a 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m and 2000 m radius [12,16]).Figure 1 Location of human alveolar echinococcosis cases with regard to elevation (A), population density (B) and climate type (C), France, 1982-2007 (n = 401) 0 100 kmPopulation density 0 100 50 >750 habitants/km210 1 5 10B C A 0 4,800 mElevation Cumulative incidence from 1982 to 2007 (per canton)Mount ain Semi-cont inent al and mount ain margins Degraded oceanic of central and northern plains Altered oceanic True oceanic Altered Medit erranean South-west basin True Medit erraneanClimate type as dened by Joly et al. Panel A illustrates that elevation is not the main factor associated with alveolar echinococcosis (AE) distribution. Panel B shows that cases were not located in densely inhabited areas. Panel C illustrates that AE cases were located in areas with a cold climate. Joly et al. [21] described the types of climate as follows: Type 1 is characterised by a high number of rainy days, high cumulative precipitation levels, minimal average temperature, maximal number of days with temperatures < 5 \u00b0C, minimal of days with temperatures >30 \u00b0C, rainfall in July and maximal interannual variability of temperatures in January and July. Type 2 is a transition from Type 1 to Type 3. Type 2 is characterised by cold January temperatures, slightly lower precipitation levels and less frequent precipitation than Type 1, and a low ratio between autumn and summer rainfall levels. Type 3 is characterised by intermediate temperatures and low precipitation levels, especially during the summer. For Type 3, the interannual variability of rainfall is minimal, while the interannual variability of temperature is high. Other climate types were of little interest regarding AE incidence patterns and were mostly characterised by warmer winter temperatures. For ethical reasons, case locations are shown at the canton level (fourth French administrative division). 4 www.eurosurveillance.orgData acquisition Case definition and data collection Cases were defined as patients with compatible clini - cal and epidemiological histories and imaging findings or positive specific serology for AE. Case data were obtained from the FrancEchino network registry, which is supported by the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire, InVS). This population-based registry actively collects French AE case data as previously described [17]. Addresses of the cases were registered in a separate anonymous database according to French regulation (Comit\u00e9 National pour l'Informatique et les Libert\u00e9s and Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes) in the context of biomedical research [18]. We interviewed all pathologists, parasitologists, pub - lic university hospital pharmacy staff (who are the only people allowed to deliver albendazole or mebendazole for AE treatment in France) and medicine, radiology and abdominal surgery hospital department staff who treat AE patients. Environmental data Demographic data were obtained from the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) [19]. Land cover data were obtained from the European Commission programme to coordinate information on the environment (CORINE) land cover (CLC) 2006 map [20]. Pixel size was 25 m x 25 m. The 44 CLC classes are typically categorised into five groups (agricultural areas, forests and semi-natural areas, artificial sur - faces, wetlands, water bodies and open spaces without vegetation). We chose to detail the group 'agricultural areas' into three subgroups (arable and permanent cul - tures, heterogeneous agricultural areas and pastures) because these types of landscape environments play an important role in the life cycle of foxes and voles, as observed in China and eastern France [12,13,15,16]. We also subdivided the group 'forests and semi-natu - ral areas' into three subgroups (broad-leaf and mixed forest, coniferous forest and shrub and herbaceous vegetation). The group 'artificial surfaces' was left unmodified, while the three remaining groups were recategorised into the class 'other'. For each analysed territory (either commune or buffer around habitats), we calculated the percentage of each CLC class and the mode, i.e. the CLC class covering the largest part of the territory. Climate data were obtained from Joly et al. [21]. Briefly, the authors provided a set of 15 raster climate maps (with a precision of 250 m x 250 m) that we used to extract 14 variables as follows: annual mean tempera - ture, number of cold days (with minimum temperature less than 5 \u00b0C), number of warm days (with maximum temperature above 30 \u00b0C), difference in mean tempera - ture between January and July, cumulative annual pre - cipitation, number of rainy days in January, number of rainy days in July, difference in precipitation levels between January and the entire year, difference in precipitation levels between July and the entire year, interannual variability in temperature in January, inter - annual variability in temperature in July, interannual variability in precipitation in January, interannual vari - ability in precipitation in July, (September + October) precipitation/July precipitation, and an integrative cli - mate typology classifying French climates into eight types (Type 1: mountain; Type 2: semi-continental and mountain margins; Type 3: degraded oceanic of cen - tral and northern plains; Type 4: altered oceanic; Type 5: oceanic; Type altered Mediterranean; Type 7: south-west basin; and Type 8: true Mediterranean) (Figure 1). For each analysed territory (commune or buffer around habitats), we calculated the percentage covered by each variable modality and extracted the mode of each variable. Elevation data were obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (ArcGIS data and maps CD-ROM, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redland, CA, United States) with a precision of 100 m x 100 m. Selection of control residences Control residences were selected from the non-profes - sional French telephone directory by applying a com - puterised algorithm based on a uniform distribution on page, column and line. We randomly selected two addresses from 10,000 inhabitants in each of the nine most affected d\u00e9partements, i.e. the d\u00e9partements with an AE incidence rate greater than the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean incidence rate. Geographical location Address location at the time of diagnosis was deter - mined using Geoportail [22]. We confirmed the location data using the cadastre registry [23]. When the location of a case (or control) residence could not be accurately determined (e.g. in a hamlet with no street name and no house number), the place of resi - dence was arbitrarily selected as the centre of the cor - responding inhabited area. Therefore, the maximum imprecision for case and control residences was less than 500 m. Cases with insufficient address data were excluded from the buffer analysis. Statistical analysis Alveolar echinococcosis distribution in communes at a national scaleGlobal spatial clustering analysis of AE-affected com - munes was performed using the Moran's I coefficient.5 www.eurosurveillance.orgThe relationship between the AE case number of each French commune and each covariable was subjected to univariate analysis using a general linear model (GLM). Univariate quasi-Poisson models were con - structed using the log population of communes as an offset and considering overdispersion patterns. The correlations between covariables were assessed using the Spearman coefficient. Only significant variables at 95% risk were retained for further analyses. Multivariate analyses were performed according to the methodology developed by Breiman (classification and regression tree (CART) analysis) [24] to classify the communes based on AE risk. This methodology only retains the main covariates among the collinear vari - ables, thereby generating a tree in which the terminal nodes represent classes of communes with common characteristics. The resulting classification was ana - lysed using a quasi-Poisson GLM to estimate standard - ised incidence ratios. Case-control study of habitats at a local scale A univariate comparison of the buffers surrounding case and control habitats was performed using the Wilcoxon test for quantitative variables and the Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Only significant variables were retained for further analyses. Multivariable analyses were carried out using the hierarchical ascendant classification on the multiple correspondence analysis results. We determined the most homogeneous land cover and climate groups independent of the AE status of the residents within the buffers [25], using v.test to describe how each vari - able influences each category. The AE incidence rates of the resulting classes were then analysed using a logistic model. The associated odds ratios were then estimated. Statistical analysis was performed using R 3.0.2 soft - ware (R foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria) with the Factominer and R-PART packages. The regression models were compared using Akaike information criterion. The test results were interpreted applying a fixed threshold at = 0.05. CartographySpatial representation of the AE data was generated using ArcGIS 9.3 software. Simple Vorono\u00ef maps were used to enhance the clarity of the buffer categories and respect ethical concerns. The commune-level results are shown aggregated at the canton level for ethical reasons. Results Alveolar echinococcosis distribution at a national scale The commune of residence was identified for 389 of the 407 cases registered by the FrancEchino net - work between 1982 and 2007. At a national level, the communes of case residences were found to be clus - tered (Moran's I index = 0.6 (Z = 26.48, p < 0.01)). Marked correlations were often found between vari - ables, especially when belonging to the same group. For example, most correlation coefficients between demographic variables were > 0.7, most correlation coefficients between altitude variables were > 0.7, and at least one correlation coefficient was > 0.5 in-between climate variables. In contrast, the land cover vari - ables exhibited weaker intragroup correlations (< 0.5). Additionally, the demographic variables, the altitude variables and eight of the 15 climate variables dis - played overdispersion. The GLM univariate analysis of AE-affected and non- affected communes revealed a disparity for all vari - ables except ((September + October) precipitation/July precipitation) and two land cover classes (heterogene - ous agriculture and other). Multivariable CART analysis showed that the climate variables provided the best discrimination between AE and non-AE communes (Figure 2A, Table 1). Five classes of communes were subsequently defined. Class 1, which represented 52% (n = 201) of the cases but only 3% of the French population (1,833,904 inhab - itants), comprised communes with a mountain climate (i.e. Type 1 climate, as defined by Joly et al. [21]). The standardised incidence ratio was 133 (95% CI: 95-191), compared with Class 5 (reference class). Class 5 rep - resented 84% of the French population (46,201,895 inhabitants) but only 38 (9.8%) cases. This class com - prised communes characterised by climate types other than mountain or semi-continental and a mean annual temperature above 9.4 \u00b0C. The other classes exhibited intermediate climatic conditions (Figure 2). Case-control study of the respective residences in the nine most affected French d\u00e9partements Of the 407 AE cases, 270 lived in the nine most affected d\u00e9partements. The commune of residence was iden - tified for 266 of these cases. A precise address (i.e. hamlet or street name and number) was available for 196 of these cases. Cases with a precise address did not significantly differ from cases with non-specific addresses regarding mean age, sex ratio, clinical sta - tus or occupation (data not shown). The 74 cases with - out a precise address were excluded from the buffer analyses. A total of 539 control habitats were selected. At this local scale (500 m, 1,000 m, 1,500 m and 2,000 m buffer radii as well as the communal level), the best model corresponded to a 500 m buffer radius and yielded five categories of habitat surroundings based on the Akaike information criterion (Table 2). Compared with the reference category (Category 1), only Categories 4 and 5 were associated with a signifi - cant increase in AE respectively) (Table 3). Category 4 consisted of habitats located in areas 6 www.eurosurveillance.orgFigure 2 National-level classification of French communes where residents are at high risk of developing alveolar echinococcosis, 1982-2007 Panel A demonstrates the commune class analysis results. The terminal nodes of the classification and regression tree (CART) analysis results correspond to the five classes of commune. The percentage of cases (left side) and inhabitants (right side) residing in each class are indicated. Class 5 is the reference class, where most of the French population is located. In contrast, most of the alveolar echinococcosis cases were located in Class 1 and Class 2 communes. Localisation of these classes and the cumulative cases during 1982 to 2007 are shown in panel B.

Category 5 included habitats characterised by pastures. Both Category 4 and Category 5 were also characterised by a very cold (25 days with cold tem - perature (less than 5 \u00b0C)) and humid (total annual precipitation 1,150 mm) mountain climate. The spatial distribution of these categories of habitat environ - ments is shown in Figure 3. Discussion In this study, we identified a significant association between climatic factors and human cases of AE in France from 1982 to 2007 at national and local scales. The map indicating human AE cases and the principal climates in France clearly highlights this association (Figure 1). Nevertheless, we observed some discrep - ancies, such as a low incidence of AE in the southern mountainous areas of France despite the cold climate. When analysing the data at the national and local scales, we were able to include additional parameters such as rainfall effects and land cover composition. Applying this analysis, we also observed an almost-perfect fit between geographical and epidemiological data. Overall, our findings indicate that an increased risk of contracting AE in France is associated with resid - ing in areas exhibiting the coldest winters, marked rainfall levels throughout the year and, to a lesser degree, forest and pasture land covers. Areas exhib - iting a mountain climate that did not report cases of human AE, such as the southern Alps, were character - ised by winters with relatively lower levels of rain and snow precipitation.Interestingly, the distribution area of the principal hosts involved in the E. multilocularis life cycle in France extends far beyond the high-risk areas shown in our study. Indeed, foxes and E. multilocularis -permis - sive rodents are found in every rural area countrywide [13]. Therefore, climate does not act only by limiting the distribution of the intermediate and definitive host populations. Our results show that AE high-risk areas are much more associated with winter temperatures and high precipitation levels than summer climatic conditions. Indeed, residing in the majority of French territories with an oceanic climate, cool summer temperatures and temperate winters was not associated with high human incidence rates of the disease. This association between AE incidence and residing in areas where win - ters are cold and humid corroborates previous studies conducted in China [26] and France [27]. Furthermore, several studies have highlighted a link between cli - matic conditions and E. multilocularis biomass in foxes. In Germany, foxes living in agricultural regions with high levels of precipitation harboured the greatest parasite burden [28,29]. Furthermore, the degree of fox infection was negatively associated with annual tem - peratures in the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt [30]. The mechanism by which cold and humid win - ters enable successful completion of the parasite life cycle remains to be explained. One hypothesis demon - strated in Alaska suggests that snow acts as a parasite life cycle facilitator [31]. The overall distribution of AE observed throughout the northern hemisphere sup - ports this hypothesis [2,32]. Regular snowy periods during the winter may greatly affect the predator-prey relationship by assisting foxes to capture rodents and thus increasing the degree of fox infection during late winter and early spring [33]. Climatic conditions may also support the conservation of E. multilocularis eggs in the environment. Although cold temperatures do not affect egg viability, hot and dry episodes during the summer can easily destroy the eggs [34]. Therefore, regions exhibiting cold winters, cool summers and a humid climate throughout the year may best support the E. multilocularis life cycle. The relatively low inci - dence of human AE in the southern Alps and eastern Pyrenees may be due to the relatively hot and dry summers, despite the cold winters exhibited in these regions. Additionally, these mountain regions are frag - mented with deep valleys, which reduce the amount of contact between different fox populations. This may support autochthonous AE foci, as shown in northern Italy [35], or impede infected foxes from importing the parasite following the extinction of local E. multilocu - laris populations. In southern France, only the western part of the Pyrenean mountains and a few patches in the southern Alps and Massif Central exhibit climatic conditions conducive to AE transmission. In these areas, AE transmission may not be perennial because the foci are relatively small and there is limited host exchange between the foci and other permissive areas [36].Table 1 Classification of risk of alveolar echinococcosis in French communes at national level, 1982-2007 Commune class Standardised incidence ratioa (95% CI) Intercept 8.22 10 7 (6.71 \u00d7 7 - 1 (NA) CI: confidence interval; NA: not applicable. Each terminal node of the classification and regression tree (CART) analysis represented a class of French communes. Compared with Class 5, where most of the French population resides, persons residing in the communes of Classes 1, 2 and 3 were at significantly higher risk of contracting alveolar echinococcosis. The communes of Class 1 exhibit a mountain climate. The communes of Class 2 exhibit a rainy semi-continental climate, while the communes of Class 3 exhibit a non-mountainous, non-continental and cold climate. a Standardised incidence ratio for each commune class displayed in Figure 2A.8 www.eurosurveillance.orgTable 2 Classification of land cover and climate in buffers of a 500 m radius around habitats in the nine d\u00e9partements in France most affected by alveolar echinococcosis, 1982-2007 Variable v.testa Category 1 (48 patients, 193 controls) Mean annual temp 9.4 and < 10.4 \u00b0C 17.147148 Number of days with cold temp (< 5 \u00b0C) 14 and < 25 13.488042 Mean elevation < 304 m 12.684608 Number of rainy or snowy days in January 13 9.087546 Total annual precipitation 940 and < 1,150 mm 8.942823 Total annual precipitation 800 and < 940 mm 8.914855 Range elevation < 61 m 7.851899 Number of rainy days in July 9 7.56979 Mountain margins and semi-continental climate (type 2) 6.171585 Difference between July and January mean temp. 14.7 and < 15.7 \u00b0C 6.088195 Category 2 (4 patients, 16 controls)Total annual precipitation 710 and < 800 mm 9.863617 Difference between July and January mean temp. 14.7 and < 15.7 \u00b0C 7.757912 Number of rainy days in July 6 and < 7 6.857535 Degraded oceanic climate (type 3) 6.857535 Altered oceanic climate 6.6954 Category 3 (45 patients, 179 controls)Difference between July and January mean temp. 16.9 \u00b0C 16.971824 Mean annual temp. 10.4 and < 11.4 \u00b0C 14.648773 Number of days with hot temp.

Moreover, human AE cases in France are irregularly dispersed, as hotspots of higher endemicity were observed at a finer scale within hyperendemic clusters [37]. Our study shows that the heterogeneous pattern of human AE incidence correlates with climate and land cover dis - tribution at a local scale. AE incidence is also closely associated with human life habits, which change over time. Depending on the country, the most frequent individual AE risk factors include a person's sex, region of residence, agricultural or pastoral occupation, dog ownership and gardening practices [3,4,6-8]. In neigh - bouring Germany, the highest-risk behaviour associ - ated with AE was farming, and gardeners were only at risk if they cultivated leaf or root vegetables [4]. These behavioural factors may partially explain the heteroge - neous pattern of human AE distribution. Our study of human AE cases complements investiga - tions focusing on the sylvatic life cycle of the para - site [12,36-38]. From 2001 to 2005, in an area of only 900 km 2 of the French Ardennes, Guislain et al. observed a north/south gradient of infestation among foxes ranging from 20% to 80%, respectively [38]. In four zones in the canton of Zurich in Switzerland, approximately 1 km in radius separated by less than 15 km, the prevalence of E. multilocularis in foxes varied of intermediate hosts, such as voles, fluctuate partially due to human behaviour [40] and thereby act as a metapopulation, as observed in China by Pleydell et al. [16]. This obser - vation therefore explains the observed variability in voles' contribution to fox alimentation and subsequent variability in fox infestation [12]. We acknowledge that this study has several limita - tions. First, our approach addressed the risk of con - tracting AE among humans over an extended time Table 3 Odds ratios associated with land cover and climate classification of the 500 m-radius buffers in the nine French d\u00e9partements most affected by echinococcosis, 1982-2007 Category of of patients/ CI) 1 48/193 not applicable.Figure 3 Map of the land cover and climate classification of the 500 m-radius buffers in the nine French d\u00e9partements most affected by alveolar echinococcosis, 1982-2007 Hierarchical clustering on principle components analysis determined five categories of habitats. Significant disparities were observed between the residence location of cases and controls even at this fine scale. Category 1 is the reference class (habitats where residents were least at risk of developing alveolar echinococcosis (AE). Persons living in Category 4- and 5-type habitats were at higher risk of contracting AE compared with individuals residing in the rest of the area (see Tables 2 and 3). For ethical reasons, a Vorono\u00ef polygon map is shown instead of buffers.1Category of habitats 2 3 4 5 0 50 km10 www.eurosurveillance.orgperiod in a relatively expansive area. Due to the vast area and extended period, the human data are prob - ably not 100% exhaustive. The process of data col - lection [17] was based on repeated inquiries with all health professionals potentially involved in case man - agement, ranging from those diagnosing the disease to those delivering specific treatments. As AE inci - dence is low in most regions of France, the disease is irregularly recognised by physicians, which may lead to under-diagnosis. However, diagnostic imaging and serological testing has greatly improved over the last few decades [41] and persistent misdiagnosis of such a chronic and severe disease is becoming less common. Additionally, if under-diagnosed cases minimised AE incidence in some areas, it is unlikely that the subse - quent bias would yield such a perfect fit between AE cases and climatic conditions. Second, as AE exhibits a long incubation period, i.e. between five and 15 years [1], the environment of cases may have changed between the dates of infection and diagnosis. However, previous analysis revealed that way of life and lifelong residence location of the same group of cases was markedly stable [3]. In France, climate and rural landscape change gradually over the course of several human generations. Therefore, the area associated with an increased risk of disease transmission to humans likely remained rather stable during the study period and will not radically change in the near future. It should, however, be emphasised that omitted parameters, such as fox population and the behaviour of humans and foxes (e.g. increase in urban fox populations), may also play a role in disease transmission. Combes et al. [42] have reported E. mul - tilocularis infection in foxes far west of documented endemic areas in France (eastern and central France), even if parasitic loads observed in foxes in western areas were low compared with that in endemic areas of eastern France [43]. Therefore, as AE epidemiology is still evolving in France and Europe, it is important to continue diligent surveillance of human and fox infestation. The We thank Sandra Moore for English revision.

Euro Surveill. 2015;20(18):pii=21117. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21117 Article submitted on 26 April 2014 / published on 07 May 2015 In 2012, blood, skin and soft tissue infections caused by clindamycin resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus; GAS) appeared to be increas - ing in the Helsinki metropolitan area. We compared monthly percentages of clindamycin resistant iso - lates in the area between 2012 and 2013, with those in 2010 and 2011. Resistance frequency in terms of patient age was also studied. We reviewed the medi - cal records of bacteraemic cases in 2012 and 2013 and linked the data to emm types. To inform on the emm distribution among GAS isolated from skin and soft tissue infections during the epidemic, GAS isolates of one month (March 2013) were emm typed. For GAS blood, skin, and soft tissue isolates taken together, the proportions of clindamycin resistant isolates were significantly higher in 2012 and 2013 (23% and 17%, respectively) compared with the two previous years (3%, p<0,001). The erythromycin resistance percent - ages were almost equal to clindamycin (22% and 17%) in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Clindamycin resist - ance was most frequent in GAS isolates of 40 to 60 year-old patients (148/417; 36%). Among clindamycin resistant isolates, 12 of 14 blood isolates from 2012 to 2013, and 11 of 13 skin and soft tissue isolates from March 2013, were emm33 . Emm33 GAS bacteraemia was associated resistance (odds ratio (OR): 7.0; 95% confidence inter - val (CI): 1.9-25.3). Infection the B (MLS B) phenotype. Emm33 GAS was responsible for the higher proportion of clindamy - cin resistance in skin, soft tissue, and blood isolates locally in 2012 and 2013.Introduction Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus; GAS) causes pharyngitis, skin and soft tissue infections, and invasive septic diseases [1]. Certain GAS emm types have been associated with tissue-specific infec - tions [2], antibiotic resistance [3], and local epidem - ics [3]. Erythromycin resistance has been linked to various emm types, such as 4, 6, 12, 75, and 77 [4-7]. Most of these emm types have been identified in throat isolates. Depending on the erythromycin resistance mechanism, isolates may also be resistant to clindamycin, although relatively rarely [8]. There is limited information concerning clindamycin resistance in GAS isolates causing skin and soft tis - sue infections. In Finland, the annual percentages of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance was only 2 to 3% in 2012 when all GAS isolates (including throat isolates) were analysed together [9]. The figures for all GAS isolates have been the same also in Helsinki met - ropolitan area [10]. In February 2013, while making the annual local antibiotic resistance statistics of 2012, a high proportion of clindamycin resistance was noticed among blood, skin and soft tissue GAS isolates. In this study, we investigated whether a specific emm type was behind this phenomenon, by examining the laboratory data of GAS isolates in 2012 and 2013 in the Helsinki metropolitan area. We used baseline data of years 2010 and 2011 for comparison. The invasive GAS cases of 2012 and 2013 were analysed in detail and linked to emm types (blood isolates) to characterise common denominators behind the increase in clinda - mycin resistance. To obtain more information on the emm distribution in GAS isolates from skin and soft tissue infections, emm typing was performed on a set of such GAS isolates obtained during March 2013 in the Helsinki metropolitan area.13 www.eurosurveillance.orgMethods Setting In Finland, the Division of Clinical Microbiology at HUSLAB is a clinical diagnostic laboratory that serves the Helsinki metropolitan area of ca 1.5 million popu - lation. It receives from the local laboratories all blood cultures flagged positive for bacteria by the BacT/ALERT3D system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) for bacterial identification and resistance analyses. The GAS blood isolates are routinely stored and sent to the national reference laboratory at the National Institute for Health and Welfare for emm typing. HUSLAB does the final identification and resistance analyses also for all other GAS isolates e.g. throat, skin, and soft tissue isolates of the Helsinki metropolitan area and keeps records of the resistance data for statistical analyses, however the bacterial isolates are not routinely stored. For this study, GAS isolates of skin and soft tissue infections of March 2013 were collected specifically, and stored at -70 \u00b0C. This was done to characterise the emm type distribution of both clindamycin suscepti - ble and resistant GAS isolates from skin and soft tis - sue infections (while the epidemic was still going on), and to verify if the distribution was the same in these isolates compared with the routinely stored blood iso - lates. We were able to gather 78% (45/58) of the total skin and soft tissue GAS isolates of the month. Microbiological methods At HUSLAB GAS isolates are routinely identified by colony morphology with betahaemolysis on sheep blood agar and Lancefield grouping with latex - tination (Latex Reagent A, Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, Hants, England). The resistance for erythromycin and clindamycin is routinely determined using the double-disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% defibrinated horse blood with 20 mg/L beta-NAD (MH-F broth). In this study, additional minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for the clinda - mycin resistant skin and soft tissue GAS isolates of March 2013 and blood isolates of 2012 to 2013 after twice sub-culturing on horse blood agar. MICs were determined 1 \u00b0C. Telithromycin susceptibility was tested by disc-diffusion method in similar condi - tions as in MIC determinations. European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2013 breakpoints were used to determine whether the zone inhibitions or MICs were considered susceptible (S), intermediate (I) or resistant (R). Emm typing and resistance gene analysis of the collected group A streptococcus isolates At the National Institute for Health and Welfare, the 45 GAS isolates of March 2013 and 109 blood GAS isolates from 2012 to 2013 were emm typed according to the guidelines provided by Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www2a.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strepblast.asp) as previously described [11]. DNA of the erythromycin and clindamycin resistant GAS isolates (blood isolates of 2012-2013; n = 14 and isolates of March 2013; n = 13) was extracted by sus - pending the colonies in 100 \u00b5l of TE buffer and boiling for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min. The presence of erm , including ermB and ermTR , and mefA genes was by for amplification A200 for ermTR [13]. Susceptibility data analysis The susceptibility analyses of clinical isolates were made using WHONET 5.6 software. We analysed the resistance figures of GAS isolates of the Helsinki met - ropolitan area between January 2012 and December 2013, and compared the data to the baseline years, namely 2010 and 2011. Blood, skin, and soft tissue isolates were analysed separately from throat isolates. One isolate per patient, the most resistant one, was included in the analysis (WHONET definition). Data were expressed as percentage of isolates resistant or intermediate for erythromycin together and as per - centage of isolates resistant for clindamycin, accord - ing to the EUCAST 2013 standard (http://www.eucast.org). The reason for this was that the standard did not include a zone diameter breakpoint for intermediate Figure 1 Percentage of skin, soft tissue, and blood group A streptococcus isolates showing reduced susceptibility to clindamycin and erythromycin in Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland, 2012-2013 (n = 1,765) Clinda R%: percentage of isolates considered resistant to clindamycin according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 2013 breakpoints; Ery R+I%: percentage of isolates considered intermediate-resistant and resistant to erythromycin, according to it clindamycin resistance was detected by antagonism of clindamycin activity by erythromycin (the D phe - nomenon) and if not present the isolate was reported susceptible. In HUSLAB the detected antagonism was reported resistant for clindamycin. Analysis of clinical data and statistics Electronic medical records of patients with a GAS posi - tive blood culture between January 2012 and December 2013 in Helsinki metropolitan area were reviewed to identify underlying conditions and any common expo - sure between the patients. Age, sex, C-reactive protein (CRP) value, and leucocyte count at the time of diagno - sis were registered. Diagnosed diabetes was recorded. Alcohol abuse was defined as a known social or medi - cal problem caused by alcohol noted in the medical records. Intravenous drug abuse was registered simi - larly when mentioned in the records. Suspected focus of infection was registered. Presence of a cutaneous infection was described as either cellulitis (infections of the skin and underlying tissues such as erysipelas and deeper non-necrotising soft-tissue infection) or necrotising fasciitis (progressive, destructive, subcuta - neous streptococcal infection with necrosis observed either directly or under surgery). Need for surgical pro - cedures, complications, and stay at an intensive care unit due to GAS bacteraemia was recorded. Mortality within seven days after GAS positive blood culture was recorded. Data were analysed and compared using Fisher's exact or Pearson chi-squared tests, or t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA), when appropriate, using SPSS for Windows statisti - cal package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Logistic regres - sion analysis was used to identify the risk factors. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results Resistance data of clinical group A streptococcus isolates When the resistance data were analysed without throat isolates, the proportions of skin, soft tissue, and blood GAS isolates obtained from Helsinki metropolitan area that were clindamycin resistant in 2012 and 2013 were respectively 23% (199/866) and 17% (153/899). The baseline figures were 3% (22/745) in 2010 and 3% (24/734) in 2011 (p < 0,001; 2012 and 2013 figures compared with 2010 and 2011 figures). The proportions of erythromycin intermediate-resistant and resistant isolates were almost equal to those for clindamycin, namely 22% (191/866) and 17% (152/899) in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Baseline proportions of erythro - mycin intermediate-resistant and resistant isolates were 4% (26/745) and 5% (33/734) in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0,001; 2012 and 2013 figures compared with 2010 and 2011 figures), respectively. The increase in proportion of isolates with clindamycin resistance began in the spring 2012 and was the high - est at 49% (40/82) in October 2012 (Figure 1). At the end of the study period, in December 2013, still 12% (10/81) of skin, soft tissue, and blood GAS isolates were clindamycin resistant. The proportion of clinda - mycin resistant isolates varied between age groups, and was highest in the 41 to 50 (35%; 84/238) and 51 to 60 year-olds (36%; 64/179), and lowest among those < 16 years of age (2%; n = 12/569; Figure 2). The proportion of clindamycin resistant throat isolates remained at the baseline level being 3% (233/8,953), and 4% (354/9,083) in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The proportion of throat isolates which were interme - diate-resistant or resistant to erythromycin were also Figure 2 Clindamycin susceptibility of skin, soft tissue, and blood group A streptococcus isolates by age group, Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland, 2012-2013 (n = 1,765) Clinda R Clinda S Figure 3 Emm type distribution of invasive group A streptococcus isolates, Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland, 2012-2013 (n = 109) 051015202530352889331661241.6144119.13.12225.128.125869.177106111.2Number of isolates Emm15 www.eurosurveillance.org3% (278/8,953) and 4% (391/9,083) in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Emm types, clindamycin resistance, and clinical data of invasive group A streptococcus cases in 2012 and 2013 A total of 109 GAS positive blood isolates were identi - fied in the Helsinki metropolitan area between January 2012 and December 2013. Figure 3 shows the emm type distribution of these invasive isolates. Of the 109 GAS positive blood isolates, 14 were clin - damycin resistant and these included 12 emm33 , one emm28 , and one emm89 . Figure 4 shows the time dis - tribution of the invasive GAS isolates resistant or sen - sitive for clindamycin with respective resistance genes. None of the emm33 isolates were susceptible for clin - damycin. During the baseline years 2010 and 2011, when clindamycin resistance among isolates was at a low level, no invasive emm33 GAS were isolated in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Table 1 compares the clinical data of emm33 cases to the cases with another emm type. In logistic regression analysis clindamycin and erythromycin resistance, alcoholism, and intravenous drug abuse (Table 1) asso - ciated with emm33 GAS bacteraemia. Of the 12 emm33 cases, 10 had infection focus on the skin or soft tis - sue. Three emm33 cases underwent a surgical proce - dure due to complications of GAS infection. There were no re-infections or need for intensive care in emm33 cases. Emm types and laboratory referral data of skin and soft tissue group A streptococcus isolates of March 2013 A total of 45 GAS isolates from skin and soft tissue infections were gathered in March 2013 and emm typed. Emm typing revealed two isolates being S. dysgalactiae subsp . equisimilis and these were dis - carded from the analysis. The remaining 43 isolates represented emm types shown in Figure 5. Of these, 13 showed clindamycin resistance and these included 11, which were emm33 . None of the emm33 were sus - ceptible for clindamycin. Ten emm33 isolates were from a skin lesion or abscess as shown by the laboratory referral data in Table 2.

Discussion During 2012 and 2013 emm33 GAS caused a local epi - demic of skin and soft tissue infections in the adult population in Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland. The outbreak was detected as a marked increase in the pro - portion of isolates resistant to erythromycin and clin - damycin. In most cases the primary infection focus was the skin, but a few GAS emm33 infections were invasive and caused necrotising fasciitis. All emm33 isolates were resistant to both erythromycin and clindamycin. There was an association of emm33 with alcohol and intravenous drug abuse, however the number of patients was very low so these results have to be interpreted with caution. Alcohol abuse was marked positive if mentioned in the patient records. Since alcoholism is not always evident and not even always actively asked about by the doctor in the hospital, this information is most probably partly lacking from our data. The same counts for intravenous drug abuse. An association with alcohol abuse has nevertheless been reported for certain other emm types, such as emm59 and emm1 [14,15]. Emm33 belongs to the emm superfamily group D, which includes emm types causing skin infections, such as impetigo [2,16]. Emm33 has further been char - acterised as a member of the D4 emm -cluster, which is able to bind plasminogen [17]. Plasminogen binding may contribute to the skin tissue tropism by possible break down of tissue barriers facilitating dissemination and prolonged bacterial persistence in the skin [18]. There is limited data concerning infections caused by this emm type. It caused some of the severe GAS infec - tions of intravenous drug users reported in a study in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2003 and 2004, but was Table 1 Invasive emm33 cases compared with invasive non- emm33 cases, Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland, 2012-2013 (n = 109) Emm33 Non- emm33 P of cases (7/5) 97 (47/50) NS - Age in years: mean (range) 54 (22-80) 51 (0-89) NS - C-reactive protein in mg/L: mean (range) 164 (4-393) 189 (4-573) NS - Leucocyte count: mean (range) 13 (4-26) 14 NS alcohol abuse: NS: not significant, p > 0.05. a Including intermediate-resistant and resistant isolates, according to EUCAST 2013 breakpoints.

Intravenous drug abuse has been shown to be a risk factor for severe disease caused by GAS [20]. GAS is able to cause very local and timely limited epi - demics, as shown in intravenous drug users in the UK [19]. Interestingly, in 2012 in our neighbouring country, Sweden, there was an increase of invasive emm1 GAS diseases occurring mostly in patients over 80 years of age [21]. The invasive emm1 numbers have remained stable in Helsinki metropolitan area between 2010 and 2013 indicating that the Swedish epidemic is local or has not reached Finland yet. The Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare receives all invasive GAS isolates from Finland for genotyping and strain collection. Since 2007, the main genotyping method has been emm typing. In Finland, the first emm33 invasive GAS isolates were found only in 2012 and they all originated from the Helsinki metro - politan area. From June 2013 onwards sporadic emm33 cases have been found also in other hospital districts, however emm33 still remains an uncommon genotype in Finland (Pieter Smit, personal communication, April 2014). Several mechanisms underlie the macrolide and lin - cosamide resistance. M phenotype isolates carry the mefA gene, which causes efflux of the antibiotic and confers resistance to many macrolides with preserved susceptibility to clindamycin and streptogramin B [22]. Emm4 GAS with mefA has previously caused high erythromycin resistance locally in Finland [23]. Interestingly, in our study none of the tested isolates carried the mefA resistance gene. The resistance data of the Helsinki metropolitan area showed also that most of the isolates with decreased susceptibility to erythromycin were also clindamycin resistant (either with inducible or constitutive phenotype) suggesting that the M phenotype was not generally present in the GAS isolates during the years 2012 to 2013. Ribosomal methylation of the target of the antibiotics (ermA , ermB or ermTR ) prevents binding of the antibiot - ics by causing a conformational change in the 23S ribo - some [24]. The ermB isolates usually show B (cMLSB) to clindamycin, and while the ermA and ermTR iso - lates may show macrolide-induced resistance to clin - damycin [13]. In our study all emm33 isolates shared the ermTR macrolide resistance gene with a cMLSB resistance phenotype. This resistance phenotype is more common among ermB but has in rare occasions also been shown by isolates carrying the ermTR gene [25]. All the emm33 isolates were also susceptible to tel - ithromycin. Usually isolates with the cMLS B phenotype are resistant or intermediate to telithromycin, however, such phenotypes harbour typically the ermB gene [26]. Accordingly, two isolates in our study (a blood emm89 and a skin isolate of March 2013 emm11 ) with cMLS B phenotype with ermB gene showed intermediate sus - ceptibility to telithromycin (data not shown). In con - trast, an isolate with inducible MLSB phenotype with ermB (skin isolate of March 2013 emm92 ) was sus - ceptible for telithromycin. The with induc - ible phenotype with ermTR gene (a blood isolate emm28 ) was susceptible for telithromycin, as were all the emm33 isolates. Similar results have shown Giovanetti et al. regarding inducible ermTR GAS iso - lates [27]. All the emm33 isolates in our study showed large disc-diameters growth suppression by telithro - mycin. Unfortunately at the time of investigation, tel - ithromycin Etests were not available in our laboratory, so we were not able to determine MICs, which would have represented more precise data. The emm33 isolates in our study were also tetracycline susceptible, while Kataja et al. showed that inducible ermTR GAS isolates in Finland in 1994 and 1995 were mostly tetracycline resistant [25]. To fully understand the resistance mechanism underlying emm33 , the iso - lates should be examined in more detail.

Clindamycin is an important drug in the primary health - care, especially, as it is used for treating GAS infections in penicillin allergic patients. The skin and soft tissue infections of intravenous drug abusers and of diabetic patients are often polymicrobial with anaerobic bacte - ria and staphylococci present making clindamycin the drug of choice for empirical treatment. In invasive, sep - tic GAS infections clindamycin is used in combination with penicillin for better outcome possibly diminish - ing the bacterial toxin production [28]. Spreading of a skin-tropic emm type with clindamycin resistance is of concern considering the empirical antibiotic treatment of the abovementioned patient groups. An announce - ment, aimed at the primary care and hospital doctors of the city of Helsinki, was released in spring 2013 by HUSLAB together with the infectious disease spe - cialists of the Helsinki city hospitals concerning the proportion of clindamycin resistant GAS figures. It guided the empirical therapy of adult skin infections recommending that clindamycin should not have been used as monotherapy. The infectious disease special - ists of the whole Helsinki metropolitan area were also informed, and additional antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted for the clindamycin resistant GAS isolates to find alternative drugs for penicillin-allergic patients. Surveillance of the situation is impor - tant because emm33 GAS may spread to children since it is a potential impetigo-causing emm type [2]. The study shows that for resistance statistics it is important to analyse skin and soft tissue GAS sepa - rately from the numerous throat GAS. Different emm types are typical for distinct anatomical locations and important resistance phenomena may be masked if iso - lates are analysed only together. Here we documented a single, local, epidemic of a previously rare emm33 GAS causing skin and soft tissue infections with also invasive cases. This emm type caused rapid changes in macrolide and clindamycin resistance locally in the adult population. These findings had an impact on the empirical treatment of skin and soft tissue infections of the area.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21122 Article submitted on 30 October 2014 / published on 07 May 2015 While the early start and higher intensity of the 2012/13 influenza A virus (IAV) epidemic was not unprece - dented, it was the first IAV epidemic season since the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic where the H3N2 subtype predominated. We directly sequenced the genomes of 154 H3N2 clinical specimens collected throughout the epidemic to better understand the evolution of H3N2 strains and to inform the H3N2 vaccine selection pro - cess. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that multiple co-circulating clades and continual antigenic drift in the haemagglutinin (HA) of clades 5, 3A, and 3C, with the evolution of a new 3C subgroup (3C-2012/13), were the driving causes of the epidemic. Drift variants con - tained HA substitutions and alterations in the potential N-linked glycosylation sites of HA. Antigenic analysis demonstrated that viruses in the emerging subclade 3C.3 and subgroup 3C-2012/13 were not well inhibited by antisera generated against the 3C.1 vaccine strains used for the 2012/13 (A/Victoria/361/2011) or 2013/14 (A/Texas/50/2012) seasons. Our data support updat - ing the H3N2 vaccine strain to a clade 3C.2 or 3C.3-like strain or a subclade that has drifted further. They also underscore the challenges in vaccine strain selection, particularly regarding HA and neuraminidase substitu - tions derived during laboratory passage that may alter antigenic testing accuracy. Introduction Influenza viruses cause significant annual morbid - ity and mortality in the global human population [1]. Epidemics occur during the winter months, cycling roughly every six months between the northern and southern hemispheres. Two influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09, and two influenza B virus (IBV) lineages, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, have been circulating among humans since 2009. Epidemics caused by each of these subtypes/lineages vary from season to season; this is due, in part, to the selec - tive advantage acquired by one subtype/lineage in a given season. Although the error-prone IAV RNA poly - merase frequently generates nucleotide substitutions that can lead to a selective advantage in all eight genomic viral RNA segments (vRNAs), new epidemic variants are most frequently due to accumulated sub - stitutions in the two surface glycoproteins, haemag - glutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Substitutions in HA/NA can give rise to variants that escape host immu - nity from previous exposures or vaccinations and are selected in the non-na\u00efve host population through a process called antigenic drift. Antigenic drift primar - ily occurs in epitopes recognised by antibodies that neutralise viral infectivity by blocking the interaction of HA with sialic acid receptors on host cell glycopro - teins [2,3]. Antigenic drift necessitates frequent updat - ing of the strains used in the influenza vaccine [3,4]. This requires global surveillance of the antigenic pro - file of circulating strains to inform the decisions made at biannual World Health Organization (WHO) meetings for the selection of influenza vaccine strains [4-6]. The acquisition of as few as one to five mutations in HA can necessitate an updated vaccine strain to optimally pro - tect the public [7,8]. The H3N2 subtype caused a severe epidemic dur - ing the 2012/13 influenza season in North America and contributed to a longer than normal season, with increased morbidity also in Europe [9,10]. Human H3N2 viruses represent a very successful lineage that has 21 www.eurosurveillance.orgcirculated since the 'Hong Kong Flu' pandemic of 1968 [11,12]. New H3N2 strains evolve continually, result - ing in annual epidemics that are periodically severe, such as the 2003/04 season (A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses) [3,7]. The 2012/13 season in the United States (US) was notable in both greater epidemic severity and limited vaccine effectiveness, especially in the elderly [13-18]. Our incomplete understanding of the factors shaping the emergence of epidemic IAV/IBV variants impairs our ability to accurately predict strain fitness and select appropriate vaccine strains. We hypothesised that the 2012/13 epidemic was caused by the emergence of a new HA variant that rap - idly displaced previously circulating strains. To gain a better understanding of the genetic and molecu - lar mechanisms central to the intensity and severity of the 2012/13 epidemic, we sequenced 154 coding-complete genomes from H3N2-positive nasopharyn - geal swabs collected throughout the 2012/13 season from a large hospital network in Houston, Texas, US. This demographically diverse system of five hospitals provides a reasonable representation of the viruses circulating in the US during a non-pandemic seasonal influenza epidemic [19], which made it a suitable site for studying IAV genetic variation. Direct sequencing of primary swab specimens is critical because H3N2 viruses are known to rapidly acquire adaptive muta - tions that change their antigenicity when passaged in cell cultures or eggs [5,20]. It allows accurate analysis of HA and NA, the identification of substitutions, and the detection of reassortment among vRNAs encoding internal proteins that contribute to viral fitness. Methods Hospital system and coding-complete viral genome sequencing The Methodist Hospital System in Houston, Texas con - sists of five hospitals that serve a large population of ca 4 million people from the most ethnically diverse population in the United States (ca 32% Caucasian, 41% Hispanic/Latino, - geal swab specimens used in this study were collected between 3 November 2012 and 8 February 2013. During this period, ca 20% of the specimens were from inpa - tients and 80% were from outpatients. The majority of inpatient isolates were obtained from patients admit - ted with influenza-like illness through the emergency department, who therefore did not have nosocomially acquired infections. These viral samples were sequenced using the Craig Venter iso - lated directly from the swab specimens, and the entire genome was amplified from 3 l of RNA template using a multi-segment RT-PCR strategy (M-RTPCR) [23,24]. The amplicons were sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, US) and/or the Illumina MiSeq v2 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, US) instruments. When sequencing data from both platforms was available, the data were merged and assembled together; the resulting con - sensus sequences were supported by reads from both technologies. Sequence curation Reference sequences for IAV HA and NA nucleotide sequences were obtained from GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and the EpiFlu database (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data; GISAID). For phylogenetic analyses, three H3N2 reference sets were used: (i) all available strains presented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the 2012/13 US vaccine composi - tion meeting (available at [25]), (ii) all available strains derived from a phylogenetic tree in the 2013 southern hemisphere vaccine composition report [26] and (iii) a random selection of 50 isolates from public databases collected globally between 1 September 2012 and 8 February 2013. For the genome constellation analysis, all available coding-complete human H3N2 genomes in the EpiFlu database collected between 1 October 2011 and 20 February 2013 were downloaded on 6 June 2013. Phylogenetic analyses HA and NA nucleotide sequences and HA amino sequences were each aligned using MAFFT v7.158b with default and trimmed using Genomics Workbench v6.0. Four independent max (ML) dendrograms were inferred using GARLI [30,31], and the trees with the best log likeli - hood scores were analysed further with 500 bootstrap replicates. The ML tree and bootstrap values were com bined using SumTrees in DendroPy For nucleotide sequences, the GTR G + I nucleotide substitution model with five rate categories was used, as determined by jModelTest v2.1.4 [33,34]. For protein sequences, the JTT G + I substitution model with four rate categories and empirically derived residue frequencies was used, as determined by ProtTest v2.4 [35]. Genome constellation analyses Study into gene segment-specific multi-FASTA files. MAFFT align - ments for each segment were converted to a distance matrix using ANDES [36]. Dendrograms were generated using the complete linkage (farthest neighbour) hier - archical clustering technique in ANDES. Dendrograms were cut at a specified per cent identity and vRNA segments were assigned to groups according to their cluster at that cut-off. The segment group assignments were combined to obtain a genome constellation that was visualised using OrionPlot [37]. Viral isolation and propagation A subset of viruses was selected to represent each co-circulating clade. Viruses were isolated from the pri - mary swab specimen for subsequent propagation and antigenic analysis. Selected strains were passaged 22 www.eurosurveillance.orgtwice in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to avoid selecting for mutations that frequently arise when IAV is isolated in embryonated chicken eggs. Supernatants from P2 viral stocks were clarified by centrifugation at 1,800 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, aliquoted, stored at 80 \u00b0C and sequenced. Influenza virus rescue using gene synthesis and reverse genetics To avoid spurious substitutions and generate a uniform virus population, positive (A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2) and A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)) and negative (A/Indiana/8/2011(H3N2v)) control viruses for antigenic testing were generated using gene synthesis [38] and a modified reverse genetics system [23,24] and were confirmed by sequencing. Briefly, 6:2 reassor - tant viruses (designated with an 'r' before the strain name, e.g. rA/Perth/16/2009) were rescued from plas - mids encoding the six internal protein vRNAs from the strains indicated in Table 1 (e.g. A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) and the linear synthesised HA and NA genes of the desired H3N2 viruses. Antisera generation/acquisition and haemagglutination inhibition Ferret antisera by inoculating ferrets (two individuals per virus) intranasally with ca 1 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of clarified virus supernatant in 1 ml, and antisera were collected 30 days after inoculation. These ferret experiments were conducted by an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-accredited company, BIOQUAL, Inc. (Rockville, Maryland, US). Antisera from the two fer - rets inoculated with the same strain were pooled 1:1 and treated with three times their volume of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, California, US) overnight at 37 \u00b0C. RDE was inac - tivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min, and the RDE-treated anti - sera were diluted with six times the original antisera volume using phosphate-buffered saline. Lyophilised sheep antisera raised against A/Victoria/361/2011 and A/Texas/50/2012 were provided by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Health and Human Services, US, and were also RDE-treated. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were per - formed [39] to determine the ability of various antisera to inhibit binding of the IAV isolates to guinea pig red blood cells. Modelling H3 N-linked glycosylation All potential HA N-linked glycosylation H3N2 clades in this study were deduced from sequons and compared with the HA of A/Finland/486/2004(H3N2), for which the H3 structure has been solved [40].

Results Phylogenetic analyses to understand H3N2 evolution The coding-complete of 154 IAV mens and their genome sequences were submitted to GenBank (Table 2). Phylogenetic analyses of HA nucleotide sequences showed that the majority of circulating H3N2 strains arose from three major H3 clades: 5, 3A, and 3C (Figure 1A; clade nomenclature was adopted from US CDC [25]). The backbone of the phylogeny had a ladder-like struc - ture with relatively short terminal branches indicative of seasonal IAV antigenic drift arising from immune escape. While multiple older clade 5 strains were co-circulating in Houston, all circulating clade 3A strains were derived from a single monophyletic group. Importantly, a large number of the study specimens (66/154 = 42.9%) contained viruses that formed an emerging monophyletic group, which formed a new 3C subgroup that we designated 3C-2012/13. The major - ity of 3C viruses fell into subclades 3C.2 and 3C.3 or subgroup 3C-2012/13, while only two strains fell within subclade 3C.1, which was the subclade of the vac - cine seed strains chosen for the 2012/13 and 2013/14 seasons (A/Victoria/361/2011 and A/Texas/50/2012, respectively). Analysis of H3N2 viruses worldwide from the onset of 2012/13 season in the northern hemi - sphere through June 2014 demonstrated that 3C.3 and 3C-2012/13 viruses also circulated in Europe and Asia (e.g. 3C.3-like A/Roma/11/2014 and 3C-2012/13-like A/Saint-Petersburg/170/2013; data not shown), sug - gesting that influenza surveillance in Houston, Texas, provided a reasonable sampling of circulating strains. However, it appears the 3C-2012/13 subgroup circu - lated through 2013 and then died out (data not shown). A larger phylogenetic analysis that included strains from recent seasons also placed our 2012/13 study strains in the context of the newest WHO-designated subclades for 3C.2 (i.e. 3C.2a) [47]. These new subclades are related to, but didn't arise directly from the 2012/13 viruses circulat - ing in Texas; their placements based on this larger analysis are labelled on the left of the HA nucleotide phylogeny (Figure 1A). Strains from all three major clades (5, 3A, and 3C) were co-circulating in Houston throughout the early, middle, and late 2012/13 epidemic (data not shown), indicating that strong temporal segregation of viral clades was not occurring within a single IAV season (Figure 1A). This shows that the emergence of a genetically novel virus early in the season did not rapidly displace other co-circulating strains. Analysis of HA protein sequences for the same dataset showed that there were relatively few residue changes across all HA clades (Figure 2). This is particularly true for the HA proteins of the subclade 3C.3 and subgroup 3C-2012/13, which is illustrated by the interleaving of colours based on the nucleotide clade assignments (Figure 1B). This HA protein phylogeny emphasises subclades 3C.2 and 3C.3, as well as subgroup 3C-2012/13, are more closely related to each other than to clade 3C.1 viruses. The NA nucleotide tree also formed a backbone char - acteristic of IAV that shows evidence of limited genetic drift in NA (Figure 1C). The NA phylogeny also showed three main groupings for the study samples, which roughly corresponded to the HA clade assignments 5, 3A, and 3C. However, colouring the NA tree using the HA clade assignments demonstrated that intrasubtypic reassortment between H3 and N2 occurs readily, as indicated by the interleaving of HA clade colours (Figure 1C). This was primarily found among 3C subclades and between clades 5 and 6. The most pronounced intrasubtypic reassortment was seen in A/Texas/JMM_27/2012, which has an HA belonging to clade 3A and an NA that groups with 3C-2012/13 viruses. Genome constellation analyses to identify reassortment To better understand the extent of intrasubtypic reas - sortment occurring among seasonal H3N2 viruses, we performed genome constellation analyses using 198 genomes (154 from our study samples and 44 additional strains). A 98% nucleotide identity cut-off value provided a genome constellation resolution that matched that of the major HA clade designations (i.e. 1, 5, 6, 3A, 3B, and 3C) (Figure 3A). This yielded 12 genome constellations and demon - strated that vRNAs coding for internal proteins are also involved in intrasubtypic reassortment. While all con - stellations shared highly similar PA and M segments, seven monophyletic HA 3C.2 samples had reassorted PB2 segments (constellation 12 in Figure 3A) that grouped with the PB2 of HA clade 3A (constellations 2 24 coding-complete influenza A(H3N2) genomes sequenced for this study, Texas, 3 November 2012-8 February 2013 (n = 154) Virus name PB2 PB1 PA HA NP sequenced for this study, Texas, 3 November 2012-8 February 2013 (n = 154) Virus name PB2 PB1 PA HA NP Similarly, while most HA clade 5 and 6 strains had unique PB2 and PB1 segments (blue boxes in the PB2 and PB1 columns of Figure 3A), three monophyletic HA clade 5 strains had retained the A/Perth/16/2009-like PB2 and PB1 segments (orange boxes for PB2 and PB1 in constellation 7 in Figure 3A). Monophyletic HA strains sharing common intrasubtypic reassortment genome constellations demonstrated that these reassortment events are likely to occur once, creating viral strains that transmit and spread to new individuals, rather than occurring as multiple independent reassortment events. NA diversity was also observed among clade 5 and 6 viruses, which can also be appreciated by the interleaving colours when HA clade designations were mapped onto the NA phy - logeny (Figure 1C). To stringently explore the diversity among clade 3C viruses, a genome constellation analysis containing only the clade 3C genomes was performed using a 99% nucleotide identity cut-off value (Figure 3B). For the most part, the four 3C subclades/subgroups each con - tained their own unique genome constellations (Figure 3B). We found that most 3C-2012/13 viruses contained a unique NS segment compared with other 3C viruses (constellation 9 in Figure 3B), and all 3C-2012/13 viruses had a unique NP segment (constellations 8 and 9 in Figure 3B). In addition, seven monophyletic HA 3C.2 specimens contained unique PB2, PA, HA, and M segments at the 99% cut-off (constellation 10 in Figure 3B), and five monophyletic HA 3C.3 samples had incor - porated a unique NA (constellation 6 in Figure 3B). Overall, genome constellation analysis revealed that intrasubtypic reassortment occurs frequently in human H3N2 viruses. In this collection alone, intrasubtypic reassortment resulted in the expansion of antigenic drift variants into new genome constellations, the gen - eration of new HA/NA combinations, and the acquisi - tion of a unique NS vRNA.Table 2c GenBank accession numbers of coding-complete influenza A(H3N2) genomes sequenced for this study, Texas, 3 November 2012-8 February 2013 (n = 154) Virus name PB2 PB1 PA HA NP the influenza A(H3N2) study samples, vaccine strains, and selected references inferred from maximum likelihood analyses of the HA nucleotide (A), HA protein (B), and NA nucleotide (C) sequences, Texas, 3 November 2012-8 February 2013 (n = 154) CDC: Centers for Disease values for nodes with 70% support following 500 replicates are provided. Clades are classified following the CDC nomenclature [25] as closely as possible and are defined based on the HA nucleotide phylogeny (A). A new subgroup, designated 3C-2012/13, appears to have arisen during the 2012/13 influenza season. The nodes from which the new WHO-designated 3C.2a, 3C.3a, and 3C.3b subclades subsequently arise are marked on the phylogeny to place our 2012/13 study in the context of more recent seasons; placement was based on additional ML and neighbour-joining phylogenetic analyses using available H3 sequence data through 2014 (data not shown). For the HA protein (B) and NA nucleotide phylogenies (C), strain names are coloured by HA nucleotide clade definitions, showing that the HA protein and NA nucleotide clades largely match the nucleotide-based HA clade definitions. However, some interleaving of 3C subclades is observed in the HA protein tree, indicating that these subclades diverge largely through synonymous nucleotide mutations. The interleaving of colours in the NA nucleotide tree signifies intrasubtypic reassortment between the HA and NA gene segments. Scale bars indicate the average number of nucleotide changes per site.

J: 3C-2012/13 viruses are among the most heavily glycosylated. 31 www.eurosurveillance.orgAssessment of antigenic evolution in a single epidemic season HI assays were performed [39] to determine the extent of antigenic drift among the H3 proteins during the 2012/13 epidemic. Two-way HI measurements, which paired an antigen with the antiserum raised against that antigen, provided HI titres that were typical for anti-H3N2 ferret and sheep antisera (Table 1). The specificity of the assay was shown by the negative control serum raised against a zoonotic H3N2 variant virus, (H3N2)v, which is antigenically similar to viruses that circulated in humans in the early to mid-1990s. Analysis of iso - lates propagated from specimens selected from the major clades showed that ferret and sheep polyclonal antisera against the recommended vaccine strains (A/Victoria/361/2011 and A/Texas/50/2012) prevented the binding of clade 5, 3C.1, and 3C.2 isolates to the sialic acid receptors on guinea pig red blood cells (Table 1). However, the emerging 3C.3 and 3C-2012/13 viruses escaped inhibition by these vaccine sera (> 16-fold reduction) (Table 1). This illustrates that the few amino acid differences in the H3 proteins (e.g. residues 128, 142, and 145 using H3 structural numbering) between the emergent 3C.3 and 3C-2012/13 viruses vs the 3C.1 viruses have enabled escape from polyclonal antibody responses to natural infections or vaccinations. The virus isolates tested in HI were sequenced and had the same HA amino acid sequences as the original swab specimens in all but two cases (Figure 2), while the NA vRNAs of 3C.3 and 3C-2012/13 viruses acquired a mutation (i.e. D151N/G) that has been shown to reduce NA activity [48], illustrating the difficulty in accurately analysing the true antigenicity of viruses circulating in humans using in vitro assays and the importance of directly sequencing the viral population in swab specimens rather than viruses isolated from eggs or tissue culture. Furthermore, the HA of many contem - porary H3N2 viruses bind inefficiently to guinea pig RBCs and the cognate NA aids in binding to receptors on the RBCs. Addition of oseltamivir in the HA assay to reduce NA binding reduced the HA titre so much for these viruses that HI assays could not be performed in the presence of oseltamivir. Examination of the HA and NA residue changes (Figure 2, Figure 4) demonstrated that a few simultaneously evolving amino acid substitutions, some causing the gain or loss of sequons for N-linked glycans, differenti - ated the HA molecules among strains in the 2012/2013 epidemic. Discussion The H3N2 subtype predominated in Houston during the 2012/13 season, as was the case throughout the US for this epidemic [10]. While viruses from several known clades were co-circulating throughout the season, the majority of IAV H3s belonged to the 3C subclades, 3C.2 and 3C.3, as well as a new subgroup designated here as 3C-2012/13. Subgroup 3C-2012/13 represented an emerging group of viruses that differed primarily in nucleotide, but not amino acid, sequence from sub - clades 3C.2 and 3C.3, suggesting the possibility of con - vergent evolution of these drift variants in the human population. Our data demonstrate that intrasubtypic reassort - ment created some of the co-circulating viruses in the 2012/13 epidemic. This finding is consistent with a recent study [12] and demonstrates that intrasubtypic reassortment is another evolutionary mechanism that antigenic drift variants can employ to gain fitness advantages and spread among the viral population. In some cases, intrasubtypic reassortment events among H3N2 segments can become fixed in the population as part of periodic selective sweeps and incorporated into the trunk of the phylogeny [49,50]. Intrasubtypic reas - sortment may also serve as a mechanism whereby drift variants can recover from a putative fitness loss (e.g. reduced receptor binding by HA) by acquiring epistatic changes through reassortment (e.g. in NA or NS) and/or the subsequent increase in amino acid replacement rates that reassortment triggers [49,50]. The NS gene segment encodes the NS1 protein, which is important in the evasion of the innate host immune response [51,52]; therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the acquisition of a unique NS gene segment in most 3C-2012/13 viruses may offer a fitness advantage in the host when paired with the 3C-2012/13 HA segment. Experimental testing of these types of reassortants (e.g. 3C-2012/13 constellations 9 and 10 in Figure 3B) is required to test this hypothesis and to better under - stand how various segments interact with drifted HA sequences to create successful H3N2 strains. Importantly, our data show that the emerging 3C.3 and 3C-2012/13 subclades/subgroups represented the majority of the virus strains sequenced in this study, and the representative samples from these clades that were tested in HI assays reacted poorly with antisera raised against the vaccine strains used for the 2012/13 season (egg- and cell-grown A/Victoria/361/2011) and the 2013/14 season (A/Texas/50/2012) which are both in the 3C.1 subclade. While use of oseltamivir in the HA assay reduced the HA titre enough that HI assays could not be performed in the presence of oseltamivir, more recent data on vaccine effectiveness and vaccine strain updates have corroborated our findings that the 2012/13 H3N2 vaccine strain was generally poorly matched for the majority of circulating 2012/13 H3N2 strains [26,47,53]. Overall, our data demonstrate that a few simultaneously evolving amino acid substitutions played a central role in immune escape by the 2012/13 epidemic viruses. Our data indicate that the H3N2 viruses escape the human immune response through a combination of specific residue changes (e.g. N145S, H3 structural number - ing) and the impact these changes have on N-linked glycosylation. Residue 145 is located on a loop of the H3 that is partly involved in receptor binding (Figure 4), 32 www.eurosurveillance.organd it is one of seven residues shown to play a cen - tral role in the antigenic drift of H3 viruses in humans [54]. Viruses in 3C.2, 3C.3, and 3C-2012/13 have the S145 substitution, while the clade 3C.1 viruses have N145. This residue is part of an N-linked glycosylation sequon, and the N145S change is likely to increase gly - cosylation of N144 [55]. Some 3C.2 viruses acquired an S124N which removes the N122 glycosylation site; they are antigenically similar to previously circulating viruses in clades 1, 5, and 3C.1 and are therefore likely to die out. However, the new 3C.2a subclade that emerged from 3C.2 (Figure 1A) and expanded in the 2014/15 season [47] has lost glycosylation at 144 (N144S) and added a new putative glycosylation site at N158. The 3C.3 viruses acquired accessory changes in or near antigenic site A, including T128A, which removes the N126 glycosylation site, and R142G; these substi - tutions are likely to be responsible for these viruses' antigenic difference from 3C.1 and 3C.2 viruses. The alterations of N-linked glycosylation sequons among the various clades (Figure 2, Figure 4) are likely to con - tribute to more complex structural differences in the HA due to the gain or loss of glycan shields [56-58]. In particular, it appears that glycans at HA residues N126 and N144 are the major differences among the 3C sub - clades/subgroups (Figure 2). Furthermore, because 3C.3-like viruses and their descendants currently circulate globally (data not shown), vaccines based on A/Texas/50/2012 are likely to offer suboptimal protection. This hypothesis is sup - ported by the moderate vaccine effectiveness for the 2012/13 season in the US (47% for IAV), where the H3N2 subtype predominated [13]. The data presented here indicate that an ideal vaccine candidate would probably be derived from subclade 3C.3a or 3C2a. The WHO influenza vaccine selection committee recently recommended an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like strain, which belongs to the 3C.3a subgroup of the 3C.3 viruses (Figure 1A), for the 2015 southern hemi - sphere season [59]. In addition to N145S, T128A and R142G substitutions, the 3C.3a viruses have acquired additional changes (A138S, F159S) that are likely to be antigenically important. Conclusion This study provides insights into the dynamics of the 2012/13 influenza epidemic by demonstrating that mul - tiple H3N2 strains co-circulated during the epidemic, that different antigenic variants evolved concur - rently and that intrasubtypic reassortment occurred frequently, suggesting that reassortment plays a role in the evolution of seasonal influenza viruses. The emergent 3C.3 and 3C-2012/13 viruses, which had sub - stitutions impacting N-linked glycosylation at major antigenic sites, predominated, and we predict that they will come to define the new trunk of the phylogeny. Finally, our data show that the accumulation of rela - tively few HA mutations can convey large selective advantages, sometimes through epistatic interactions, and support the new 2015 southern hemisphere vac - cine strain recommendation.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21114 Article submitted on 26 June 2014 / published on 07 May 2015 In May 2014, Public Health England was alerted to two separate laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infec - tion who transited through London Heathrow Airport while symptomatic on flights from Saudi Arabia to the United States of America. We present the ration - ale for the public health response to both incidents, and report results of contact tracing. Following a risk assessment, passengers seated two seats around the cases were prioritised for contact tracing and a proac - tive media approach was used to alert all passengers on the planes of their possible exposure in both inci - dents. In total, 64 United Kingdom (UK) residents were successfully contacted, 14 of whom were sat in the pri - ority area two seats all around the case(s). Five pas - sengers reported respiratory symptoms within 14 days of the flight, but all tested were negative for MERS-CoV. Details of non-UK residents were passed on to rel - evant World Health Organization International Health Regulation focal points for follow-up, and no further cases were reported back. Different approaches were used to manage contact tracing for each flight due to variations in the quality and timeliness of the pas - senger contact information provided by the airlines involved. No evidence of symptomatic onward trans - mission was found. Introduction On 2 May 2014, Public Health England (PHE) was alerted by the public health authorities in the United States (US) of a laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection who had transited through London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom (UK) on a flight from Saudi Arabia to the US [1]. Nine days later, the US authori - ties notified PHE of a second, unlinked, laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that had also travelled from Saudi Arabia to the US and transited through Heathrow Airport [1].This article describes the contact tracing approaches undertaken for both in-bound flights, compares the issues and outcomes and provides recommendations on future approaches. The results of contact tracing of UK nationals on the same onward flights from London to the US as the cases are also reported. MERS-CoV is a novel coronavirus, first detected in a patient in 2012 [2]. As of 16 April 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) have been notified of 1,106 cases of MERS-CoV, with 421 deaths [3]. The vast majority of cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. However, exported MERS-CoV cases have occurred in several countries outside the Middle East the majority travelling by air [4]. The public health response to many of these cases involved follow up of close contacts on planes to detect any evidence of onward transmission. Only limited secondary trans - mission has been demonstrated to date around such exported cases [5]. Two earlier imported laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases from the Middle East have been documented in the UK. Of these, the first was transported to the UK via private air ambulance and the second travelled on a commercial flight. Both were symptomatic during their flights. No secondary cases were identified among the contacts on either of these flights, however two fam - ily contacts of the second case were later identified as confirmed cases following transmission in the UK in household and hospital settings [6,7]. Outside of these incidents, we are aware of four further published reports of confirmed MERS-CoV cases trav - elling on commercial flights, including two cases who were reported to have travelled while symptomatic to Greece and Italy, respectively [8,9]. Another was an asymptomatic case who travelled to Malaysia and later developed symptoms upon arrival [10]. In May 2014, two laboratory-confirmed cases travelled on the 36 www.eurosurveillance.orgsame flight from Saudi Arabia to the Netherlands while symptomatic [11]. Variable approaches were used for the contact tracing of flight contacts in each of these incidents, however, all failed to identify any evidence of onward transmission to other passengers. London Heathrow Airport is a key air transport hub, and more passengers from the Middle East travel to, or transit through the UK than any other country in Europe [12]. This paper describes the public health response to two further laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases on commercial flights, provides further evidence on the potential transmissibility of MERS-CoV during air travel, and informs the public health response to pos - sible future incidents. The paper also explores alter - native options to identify possible cases by using the media and public information messages to raise aware - ness among those travelling to and returning from the Middle East, particularly in circumstances when pas - senger lists may not be available. Incident 1 - Flight Riyadh to London Heathrow, 24 April 2014 (with onward travel to Chicago) On Friday 2 May 2014, PHE was alerted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of a reported probable case of MERS-CoV infection, posi - tive on screening by PCR but awaiting confirmation by the national reference centre. The case had trav - elled eight days earlier from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to Chicago, US, on 24 April, transiting through London Heathrow Airport. Confirmation was received from CDC at 8p.m. GMT on 2 May 2014 [1]. The case was a health - care worker who had been working in a Saudi Arabian healthcare institution that treated MERS-CoV patients [1]. The case first felt unwell on 18 April. Six days later, they were symptomatic with fever and myalgia, but without respiratory symptoms, during the seven hour flight from Riyadh to London. They spent approxi - mately two hours at London Heathrow before boarding a flight to Chicago. Following the initial notification on 2 May, PHE immediately convened an incident manage - ment team. Considerations for contact tracing Although the risk of onward transmission to passen - gers and crew on board the flight was considered to be very low, given the recent emergence of MERS-CoV it was agreed with the CDC to adopt a precautionary approach and undertake contact tracing on the basis of protecting public health, as well as to add to the exist - ing evidence base for risk of transmission on aircraft and inform future responses. In the UK it was agreed that passengers in the immedi - ate vicinity of the case were a priority and should be contacted and followed up. At the time of the incident no specific international guidance on contact tracing on aircraft for MERS-CoV cases existed, therefore guid - ance on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was considered as the most analogous and suitable for our investigation. The current European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Risk Assessment Guidelines for Infectious Diseases transmitted on Aircraft (RAGIDA) suggests that for SARS, contact trac - ing should be comprehensive, and may extend to pas - sengers up to seven rows around the case, or even the entire plane, whereas WHO guidance suggests two rows in front and behind the case and the row they are sat in [13,14]. Given that there has been little evidence from previous incidents to suggest MERS-CoV is eas - ily transmissible on aircrafts, it was decided to adopt a more pragmatic approach based on the WHO guidance. Passengers seated in the two seats all around the case were deemed to be 'priority' contacts. The remaining passengers and crew were to be alerted to the situa - tion and advised on the actions to take should they develop respiratory symptoms within the 14 days fol - lowing the flight. The flight manifest and contact details of the passen - gers were requested from the airline. Previous experi - ences of obtaining passenger details for contact tracing suggested this information could take some time to obtain. A proactive media approach was developed to rapidly initiate the contact tracing process, on the basis that the forthcoming weekend of 3 to 5 May included a public holiday, and that eight days of the 14-day incu - bation period had already passed. The press release was timed to coincide with the announcement of con - firmatory test results from the US and was issued on Friday 2 May with details of the flight number, and advice to any passengers with respiratory symptoms on that flight to seek medical advice through NHS 111, (a UK telephone service for health advice provided by the National Health Service), due to limited primary care access over the weekend. An algorithm was devel - oped to support call handlers to manage calls from members of the public who had been on the flight. Follow-up and criteria for testing The passenger contact details were provided by the airline within hours of request and contained names, nationalities and contact details for all passengers. Priority contacts who were identified as being resident in the UK from their contact details, were initially inter - viewed centrally by staff at the Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC) on the even - ing of Friday 2 May, and their details were passed to their local health protection team for follow-up. They were informed of a possible exposure to a confirmed MERS-CoV case and asked whether they had devel - oped any respiratory symptoms since the flight. The definition of a possible case, and criteria for test - ing, was anyone who was on the flight and who had experienced respiratory symptoms, within 14 days of the flight. This definition is synonymous to the PHE close contact definition for MERS-CoV [15]. Symptomatic contacts were assessed by a health professional over the phone, and were asked to self-isolate or attend 37 www.eurosurveillance.orghospital if warranted. Lower respiratory samples and/ or nose and throat swabs were arranged using appro - priate infection control precautions [16]. Asymptomatic contacts were asked to report any respiratory symp - toms or fever that developed within the remaining 14 day period from the flight. All priority contacts were followed-up by local health protection teams (Figure 1) for at least 14 days since their exposure - the maxi - mum putative incubation period of MERS-CoV. The details of all passengers that were non-UK resi - dents were sent to relevant national focal points via the bilateral International Health Regulations (IHR) and European Early Warning Response System (EWRS) over the public holiday weekend, and feedback on the health status of these contacts was requested. In addition to passengers on the Riyadh to London flight, details for those on the London to Chicago flight who had returned to the UK were sent to PHE by the CDC and were prioritised and followed up as above. Following the weekend press release, all remain - ing passengers resident in the UK on the flight were actively contacted on Tuesday, 6 May, following the public holiday weekend. Where the address of pas - sengers was known, their contact details were passed on to the relevant local health protection team to make contact. Otherwise passengers were informed centrally by CIDSC who gathered the relevant contact details. Passengers were asked to report whether they had experienced any respiratory symptoms within 14 days of the flight. If yes, they were managed in the same way as the priority contacts, but they were not followed-up after 14 days. Incident 2 - Flight Jeddah to London Heathrow, 1 May 2014 (with onward travel to Boston) On 11 May 2014, PHE was alerted to a second probable case of MERS-CoV infection (later confirmed) who had travelled from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to Boston, US via London Heathrow Airport 10 days previously, on 1 May 2014 [1]. The case became symptomatic on the day of the flight and was symptomatic on board the six hour UK bound flight with symptoms of fever, chills, myalgia and a slight cough. Contact tracing A basic passenger manifest containing names and seat numbers of all passengers on the flight was available from the airline within 24 hours of the notification from the CDC. The passenger contact details were only pro - vided on 14 May, at the end of the 14 day follow-up period. In a similar fashion to incident 1, a pro-active press release was issued on 12 May to alert passengers, and the NHS 111 algorithm was adapted to include passen - gers on this flight. Given that the maximum incubation period of 14 days was exceeded by the time informa - tion was available, only the 17 passengers who sat in the immediate two adjacent seats to the case were identified for active contact tracing, however contact details were not available for seven of them. They were asked about any respiratory symptoms that might have developed within 14 days of the flight. If they had developed symptoms within 14 days of the flight, and were still symptomatic, they were clinically assessed, asked to self-isolate and sampling was undertaken as described above. Where available, the details of non-UK residents sitting in the two seats all around the case were passed to the respective national focal point via bilateral IHR and EWRS mechanisms. The CDC provided details on pas - sengers who were on the flight from London to Boston, but had returned to the UK, and they were contacted if they were seated within two seats all around the case. Contact tracing results Results of the contact tracing are depicted in Figure 2. Incident 1 - Flight Riyadh to London Heathrow There were 178 passengers on the flight manifest on 24 April 2014, including the case. Of these, 49 passen - gers were UK residents of whom four were considered priority contacts as they were seated within two seats all around the case; the remaining 45 were seated else - where in the plane. PHE successfully contacted 36 of these passengers. None of the four priority passengers reported acute respiratory symptoms in the 14 days since the flight; however, three of the non-priority pas - sengers reported mild respiratory symptoms during Figure 1 Algorithm for management of flight contacts in two incidents of confirmed MERS-CoV cases travelling on flights through London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom, May 2014 MERS-CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; PHE: exposure to MERS-CoV Experie nced any respiratory symptoms or fever in the 14 days since the flight? - Explain sympto ms - Advise to contact PHE if t hey develop sympto ms within 14 days of Follow-up after 14 days if sat in priority area MERS-CoV testin g requested - No se and thro at sw abs - Sputumflight38 www.eurosurveillance.orgthis period and were still symptomatic. None required hospitalisation. Testing of symptomatic contacts The two symptomatic contacts were sampled and tested. Both were negative for MERS-CoV by PCR test - ing. One contact was positive for rhinovirus and the other one was positive for influenza B virus. The third symptomatic contact was not tested as they did not agree to be further contacted by the local health pro - tection team. Non-United Kingdom residents Of the 128 passengers who were non-UK residents or nationals, 13 were seated within two seats all around the case, the remainder were seated elsewhere on the plane. Details of these passengers were passed to respective international counterparts for contact trac - ing. Of these 13 passengers that were non-UK residents and were seated in the priority area, seven were con - tacted and all were asymptomatic. There was no feed - back received about the non-UK passengers seated elsewhere on the plane. Incident 2 - Flight Jeddah to London Heathrow The flight manifest identified 17 passengers on the flight on 1 May 2014 who were priority contacts. Four of these passengers were UK residents and six were international contacts. No contact information was available for seven of the passengers. Of the four UK contacts, three were successfully contacted, none of whom reported any acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days of the flight. No further information was received on the international passengers. Onward flights from London Heathrow to the United States The CDC informed PHE of contacts on the onward flights from London to the US. Incident 1 The case travelled to Chicago on 24 April and 23 UK contacts were identified on this flight, two of these were considered priority contacts. Contact was made with one who did not report any respiratory symptoms within nine days from the flight. The other 21 UK resi - dents on the flight were considered non-priority con - tacts, and 18 were successfully contacted, of whom one was symptomatic within the 14 days after the flight. Upper respiratory tract samples tested negative for MERS-CoV and for other respiratory viruses. Incident 2 The case travelled to Boston on 1 May and 13 UK con - tacts were identified on this flight. Ten of these con - tacts were considered priority contacts, of which six were successfully contacted and one was found to be symptomatic. This contact was found to be positive for streptococcal A infection, but negative for MERS-CoV and a respiratory virus panel (adenovirus, respira - tory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus and influenza A and B virus). Discussion and conclusions Given the prominence of the UK, and particularly London Heathrow, as a key air transport hub connected with the Middle East and continued reporting of new MERS-CoV cases from that region, it is probable that similar incidents will occur in the future. This may hap - pen with higher frequency during times of increased local transmission in the Middle East as was observed in April-May 2014. Although the incidence of MERS-CoV has remained low compared with this particular peak period, a smaller peak of cases occurred in Saudi Arabia during early spring 2015, suggesting there may Figure 2 Results of contact tracing for UK residents in two incidents of confirmed MERS-CoV cases travelling on flights through London Heathrow Airport, UK, May 2014 MERS-CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; UK: United Kingdom. Information on contact tracing of international contacts on the flights is not displayed in this figure.Laboratory testN=unknown Succes = 0/1MERS-CoV positive = 0/139 www.eurosurveillance.orgyet be an aspect of local seasonality to MERS-CoV transmission [17]. Contact tracing investigations, such as the one described, have significant resource impli - cations for public health due to the effort required to identify and follow up passengers on a flight. In total, there were 89 UK contacts on board these flights, of which 20 were priority contacts and 69 non-priority contacts. The contact tracing carried out for the two flights to the UK described in detail in this paper and among UK residents on the two flights to the US, did not identify any further symptomatic cases of MERS-CoV infection. This adds to the growing body of evidence of the lack of transmission to date from symp - tomatic MERS-CoV cases during air travel [8-11]. During the investigation we only took clinical sam - ples from symptomatic contacts. This is a limitation, as MERS-CoV infection has been observed to cause mild disease and asymptomatic infections which we may not have identified by the approach outlined in this paper [6]. However, we used a low threshold for symptoms requiring testing to increase the likelihood of identifying mild cases. We also did not test contacts serologically unless there was an indication of second - ary transmission from initial tests, as serology was not considered to be proportionate to the public health risk based on evidence from other investigations. We were unfortunately unable to contact all the people considered to be priority contacts, which is a further limitation of our investigation. However, no cases of MERS-CoV infection have been confirmed in the UK since the flights. One priority contact reported symp - toms, however they did not accept further contact with the local health protection team, and would not attend for testing. They were provided with advice on the symptoms, and how to contact health services should their condition deteriorate. The two incidents illustrate the possible challenges and unpredictability of public health investigations. In both, public health authorities only became aware of the incidents sometime after the exposure. In the first incident a full flight manifest with contact details for most of the passengers, was available within 12 hours of notification, enabling an effective, although resource intensive, response. In the second incident the contact details of passengers were not available until several days following the first notification. Moreover, the details, when available, were incomplete, and contact tracing did not take place until after the end of the maximum putative incubation period of 14 days, mini - mising the potential public health benefits of the inves - tigation. We did not receive information on the health status of all the non-UK contacts that were passed to other national focal points. This is a further challenge in the investigation of these incidents, as the majority of flight contacts were non-UK nationals. The difficulties of undertaking rapid and effective contact tracing on flights due to the variability of the information made available by the respective airlines, and the speed at which it is received, even if consider - able effort and resources are committed is highlighted here. The public health responsibilities of conveyanc - ers are outlined in the International Health Regulations [18]. There are specific regulations regarding the pro - vision of passenger contact information when an inci - dent of public health concern is identified during the flight. However, there is no public health legislation requiring conveyancers to retain information such as passenger manifests or contact details for contact tracing in the event that disease is identified after the flight. Although both airlines in these described incidents were very co-operative, it is recommended that the ability to rapidly access plane manifests with adequate information to enable public health investi - gation be further strengthened. Declaring MERS-CoV infection as a notifiable disease within the UK may contribute to this; however, administrative practices among airlines with regards to the length of time flight manifests and contact details are retained would also need to be addressed. New UK legislation (in develop - ment) is likely to mandate that best efforts are made to provide passenger contact information for such public health investigations, however, currently such airline co-operation is on a voluntary basis [19]. Due to past difficulties in obtaining passenger informa - tion, PHE sought to explore other mechanisms to alert passengers on these flights in a timely manner. In both incidents a pro-active media approach linked to a tel - ephone help-line service was applied in an attempt to alert passengers in the UK prior to the passenger infor - mation becoming available. In practice no passenger contacts were identified through this mechanism that we are aware of. Although not formally measured, the incident response highlighted a lack of awareness of MERS-CoV infections among passengers travelling to and from the Middle East. Many of the passengers spo - ken to during the contact tracing expressed very limited knowledge of MERS-CoV symptoms or risks. Following the incidents, as a more general measure PHE adapted CDC information materials for display in airports in order to raise awareness of MERS-CoV among the gen - eral public and provide advice on the symptoms and how to access medical attention. These have also been circulated to airlines with direct flights to the Middle East; however, uptake and use has been limited due to airports expressing commercial concerns. Finally, the option of alerting all non-priority contacts via text mes - sage was considered, and although this was not done during the incidents, it could be a resource-effective approach as a phone number was the most consist - ently available contact information within the manifest. The response to this incident required significant resources at both a national and local level, as well as international collaboration. Over the course of the weekend and the initial incident response, several inci - dent meetings were held, with around 20 senior staff in attendance across epidemiology and surveillance, 40 www.eurosurveillance.orgport health, microbiology services, operational health protection staff, communications and the NHS. Within PHE four scientists, as well as seven specialist regis - trars worked full time on the contact tracing and inci - dent response over several days. At a local level, 18 local health protection teams were involved in the con - tact tracing and follow-up. This sort of contact tracing requires significant person-time, and for this reason, any decision to deploy this level of resource should be taken judiciously, particularly in the emerging evidence of limited transmissibility in such settings. Supranational organisations such as WHO and ECDC and the established information processes such as IHR national focal points, and the EWRS play a key role in incidents such as this. On both flights, the major - ity of persons were non-UK residents, and using these systems we were able to pass on details, and receive information on the health status of non-UK contacts with international counterparts. However, not all focal points responded, and so there were still gaps in our information. Given the international nature of air travel, an enhanced role of ECDC or WHO could be to encourage countries to respond to requests for infor - mation on identified contacts, providing more reliable information on transmission in the early stages of an emerging infection. There are still some gaps in understanding of the risk of transmission of MERS-CoV from patients who are asymptomatic, or who do not have respiratory symp - toms [20,21] There is evidence of transmission from cases with mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic [22]. However, documented episodes of human-to-human transmission have been concentrated in health - care settings, or within households. This suggests that close and prolonged contact with the case is required [23]. The first case reported here had no respiratory symptoms during the flight and may have posed a very low transmission risk if MERS-CoV transmissibil - ity is similar to other respiratory viruses. The second case had a slight cough, and so may have represented a slightly greater infection risk through the respiratory route. A better understanding of the risk of transmissi - bility will allow the scale of the public health response to be modified. However, until a better understanding is achieved, the public health response to such events needs to remain precautionary. In the meantime, the need to develop less resource-intensive methods of contact follow-up and investigation persists. In light of the UK experience, and the limited evidence of in-flight transmission of MERS-CoV from other inves - tigations, we would argue that contact tracing and follow-up of the entire plane, or up to the maximum range of seven rows either side of the case (as per the RAGIDA guidelines for SARS) is not a proportionate response for cases of MERS-CoV travelling on flights in general. We recommend that based on current evi - dence, contact tracing of two rows in front and behind, or as in our investigation, two seats all around the case, represents a more appropriate approach in most circumstances, although this needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Euro Surveill. 2015;20(18):pii=21115. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21115 Article submitted on 02 April 2014 / published on 07 May 2015 Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a worldwide zoonosis, is highly endemic in southern and eastern Europe. Its actual prevalence is unknown due to the lack of effi - cient reporting systems designed to take into account the particular features of the disease. Neglect of CE makes diagnosis and clinical management difficult outside referral centres, with inconsistencies in clinical practice and often unnecessary procedures carried out that have associated risks and costs. The Italian reg - istry of CE (RIEC) is a prospective multicentre registry of CE patients seen from January 2012 in Italian health centres; data are voluntarily submitted to the regis - try. Its aims are to show the prevalence of CE in Italy, bring the importance of this infection to the attention of health authorities, encourage public health policies towards its control, and stimulate biological, epidemi - ological and clinical research on CE. From January 2012 to February 2014, a total 346 patients were enrolled in 11 centres, outnumbering national reports of many CE-endemic European countries. We discuss prelimi - nary data and challenges of the RIEC, template for the European registry of CE, which has been implemented within the Seventh Framework Programme project HERACLES (Human cystic Echinococcosis ReseArch in CentraL and Eastern Societies) since September 2014. Background Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease affect - ing an estimated 1.2 million people worldwide, with 3 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost glob - ally every year, although these figures are likely to be underestimates [1]. Echinococcus granulosus , the cestode causing the infection, completes its life cycle between dogs and other canids (definitive hosts) and livestock, especially sheep (intermediate hosts), with humans as accidental intermediate hosts. In humans, the parasite develops in its metacestode stage, form - ing cysts in organs and tissues, mainly in the liver. CE is mostly endemic in rural areas where sheep raising is practiced, such as central Asia and China, South America and Mediterranean countries [2]. In 2012 a joint FAO/World Health Organization (WHO) expert group classified E. granulosus second among the top eight ranked food-borne parasites of global public health importance [3]. Nevertheless, compared with other diseases of similar burden, CE has received much less attention and funding [4]. Human CE has been described as chronic, complex and neglected [5]. The lack of efficient reporting systems designed to take into account the particular features of this disease results in under-reporting and/or misre - porting of CE. In a vicious circle, under-reporting leads to the perception that CE is not an important health problem, which in turn makes measurement of disease burden and impact on public health even more difficult. Neglect hampers the collection of good-quality data to inform control programmes and evidence-based diag - nostic and therapeutic strategies. This ultimately leads to at least suboptimal clinical management of cases and allocation of public resources for treatment and control. Reasons for neglect Neglect of CE is due to several factors [1]: firstly, the life cycle of E. granulosus is difficult to interrupt in the absence of sustained, expensive and well-coordi - nated programmes. Secondly, control of the infection in humans, as opposed to livestock, does not have an impact on the global spread of infection. CE is not per - ceived as an important animal health problem, which is therefore not tackled. Thirdly, the burden of CE is dif - ficult to quantify because of its geographical dispersal in vast rural areas, absence of specific symptoms, and lack of an effective disease record system. Lastly, the disease affects mostly poor pastoral communities, with 43 www.eurosurveillance.orga low case fatality rate but with difficult and expensive diagnosis and treatment. Implications of chronicity and complexity of cystic echinococcosis In humans, echinococcal cysts grow slowly, passing through several stages (Figure 1), and often remain clinically silent for many years [6,7]. Thus, infected patients may be diagnosed long after infection and in a country different from where the infection was acquired. This compounds the difficulty in evaluating the distribution of CE. Diagnosis and clinical manage - ment of CE are complex and require a multidiscipli - nary approach, often available only in referral centres. Imaging, in particular ultrasound, is the mainstay of diagnosis and follow-up of abdominal CE [6,8] while serology has only an ancillary role [9]. In 2003, the WHO Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (IWGE) implemented a consensus classification of cyst stages [6] (Figure 1). This followed the introduction of the first widely used ultrasound classification of hepatic CE proposed by Gharbi et al. [10]. The - sification allows all morphological stages of cysts to be classified unequivocally, and groups them into clinical categories reflecting the current knowledge of the natural history of CE. Importantly, it provides a guide for the rational allocation of CE patients to dif - ferent management options [11]. However, this consen - sus approach, and the use of CE classifications of any kind, are still widely underused [12], adding to the lack of prospective randomised trials evaluating the opti - mal stage-specific clinical management of CE, which hampers an evidence-based approach to this disease. Clinical management of CE still relies on expert opinion [11] and the management of the disease is often inap - propriate, exposing patients (and health systems) to unnecessary treatments and costs. Reporting systems and burden of cystic echinococcosis in Italy and Europe CE is endemic in Italy, although its burden is difficult to estimate. Despite being a notifiable infection in ani - mals [13], being listed among reportable occupational diseases [14] and subject to surveillance according to European legislation [15], notification of human cases ceased de facto to be compulsory in 1991. Currently, health authorities are required to provide only a yearly summary of regional data [16]; it is up to the individual physician to notify cases. As a result, no official data are transmitted to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [17-19]. At the national level, a mean of 1,379 (SD: 442.5) yearly hospital dis - charges with a diagnosis of CE were recorded in 2001-12, with annual incidence estimated to range from 0.18 to 6.78 per 100,000 population [20]. However, report - ing based solely on hospital discharge records is inad - equate, as the majority of CE cases are diagnosed and managed in an outpatient setting [21], besides the fact that asymptomatic cases can be only diagnosed dur - ing screening campaigns. For example, an ultrasound survey carried out by Caremani et al. [22] in 19 centres throughout Italy in 1988-90 found 424 cases diag - nosed with CE by examining 333,144 patients, com - pared with 284 cases reported in the official data in the same period. Prevalence and incidence data in live - stock are also incomplete [17,19]. Difficulties in reporting of CE do not apply to Italy alone. Very heterogeneous national surveillance sys - tems for CE exist in Europe [17]. However, comparison of notified cases with hospital records indicates a clear discrepancy, with consistent underestimation of the burden of CE [17,18]. For example, Pardo et al. reported a two- to fourfold lower number of notified cases com - pared with hospital records in certain regions of Spain from 1996 to 2003 [23]. Besides inaccurate reporting of the number of cases, other limitations of current reporting systems include ambiguity in discrimination between autochthonous Box Data acquired in the Italian registry of cystic echinococcosis, January 2012-February 2014 Birth and residency data; contact details Epidemiology- residence in and visits to CE-endemic areas - field of employment at and before CE diagnosis- rural at-risk activities carried out before CE diagnosis - risk factors: contact with at-risk dogs, or potentially contaminated soil, food or water- known relatives with CE Clinical history- patient classification (first diagnosis, follow-up, relapse) - year, place and imaging tool of first CE diagnosis - past and current symptoms - past and current therapies/management strategy of CE (including length and complications) Cysts characteristics at diagnosis and at each visit- number - organ and localisation within the organ (e.g. liver segment) - size (small < 5 cm; medium 5-10 cm; large > 10 cm) - stage (according to the WHO-IWGE classification [6]) - complications Serology - test (manufacturer, antigen, format) - result including titre where applicable CE: cystic echinococcosis; WHO-IWGE: World Health Organization Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis.

Given the chronicity and frequent relapses in CE [24,25], patients often access different health centres over time, which could lead to potential duplication of data, which would also contribute to inaccurate sta - tistics. In addition, aspects such as cyst stage and therapy outcome, which have a profound impact on the clinical management of patients and in turn on public health resource allocation, are generally not collected in notification forms. Setting up the Italian registry of cystic echinococcosis To start tackling these long-standing problems, the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Clinical Management of Cystic Echinococcosis, (University of Pavia, San Matteo Hospital Foundation, in Pavia) and the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (the Italian National Health Institute, ISS, in Rome) set up the Italian registry of cystic echinococcosis (Registro Italiano Echinococcosi Cistica, RIEC). The aims of the registry are to show the prevalence of CE in Italy, bring the importance of this infection to the attention of health authorities, encourage public health policies towards its control, and stimulate biological, epidemiological and clinical research on CE. Organisation and management of the Italian registry The development of RIEC started in 2012 as part of a research project (IZS SA 07/10 RC) at the Sardinian Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute. The Project was managed by ISS and the Pavia WHO collaborating centre. The project group included a project manager (PR), project coordinators (FT, EB), and an information technology developer (FG). After approval from the eth - ics committee of the ISS, RIEC was launched in October 2012, and is accessible through the ISS website [26]. The RIEC website [27] includes sections freely accessi - ble to the public providing educational and scientific material, and a restricted area, accessible only to users authorised to enter data. The project group performs regular monitoring and evaluation of the database. Ownership of data from individual centres belongs to the individual centres themselves; however, upon per - mission, the project group analyses and publishes a cumulative summary of data on a regular basis. Data collection RIEC is a prospective, observational, multicentre reg - istry of CE patients seen from January 2012 onward in Italian health centres that adhere voluntarily to the registration of their patients into RIEC. Clinicians of all disciplines in health centres potentially interested in joining RIEC are contacted by email and during scien - tific meetings. Clinicians are given a unique username and password to access the registry. Individual clini - cians have access only to data of patients enrolled in their centres, and they can enrol and access data of CE patients previously recruited in another centre who subsequently moved and are then under their care. The only inclusion criterion to enrol a new patient in the registry is that the patient has been diagnosed with probable or confirmed CE [11], whether hospitalised or in an outpatient setting and independent of country of birth and nationality. Upon first enrolment, a unique patient 'RIEC code' is generated automatically, avoid - ing duplication of records, should the patient present at another centre in the future, and facilitating data retrieval during follow-up. Following written informed consent concerning processing of sensitive data, other information can then be acquired (Box). These are entered using drop-down menus and multiple-choice options to facilitate data extraction and analysis, and can be updated following duplication and amendment.Figure 1 World Health Organization Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis ultrasound safety and confidentiality RIEC is established within the secured ISS information technology network, in compliance with national and international regulations on the protection and use of personal data. Data are stored in a three-stage clus - ter database server implemented in a redundant array of independent disks and made available by an SQL-relational database management system server. The connection between authorised user and web applica - tion is made via an HTTP protocol. All registered data and logs are backed up at short regular intervals, and copied on a tape library stored in different fireproof locations. Upon patient registration, sensitive data are automatically anonymised with the assignment of a unique code, which is uncoupled from sensitive data to make them encrypted.Preliminary findings By February 2014, 16 centres had adhered to the RIEC, with 346 patients enrolled in 11 centres. The remaining five centres had not yet had any enrolled patients. The majority of records (212 patients) were entered by the WHO collaborating centre in Pavia, showing a mean of 1.46 visits per patient (standard deviation (SD): 1.09; range: 1-4 visits/patient). Preliminary demonstrative results are derived from data from this centre. A total of 110 male and 102 female CE patients were seen in this centre from January 2012 to February 2014 and were enrolled in the RIEC (Figure 2A). The mean age at diagnosis was 40 years (SD: 6.8; range: 5-77) (Figure 2A). Of the 212 patients, 131 (62%) were born in Italy, while 81 (38%) were foreign-born (Figure 2B).

A total of 14 newly diagnosed cases were recorded in 2012 (13% of 108 visits in 2012) and 21 in 2013 (21% of 99 visits in 2013). During first enrolment, the majority (70%, n = 148) of patients had a single cyst (Figure 2C), and 333 of 361 cysts (92%) (CE4 and CE5) cysts stages were most commonly present at the time of enrolment (Figure 2D). Discussion The implementation of the RIEC responds to a long-standing need for a CE national registry with online data entry [11,21], similar to the European registry for alveolar echinococcosis [28]. Its design allows the col - lection of both basic epidemiology and detailed longi - tudinal clinical data in a simple and unequivocal way. This will provide valuable information on the prevalence and parasitic pressure (linked to the number of small, active cysts) in patients in endemic areas. Moreover, it will offer the opportunity to study prospectively and systematically the stage-specific effectiveness of clini - cal management options and clinical manifestations, the rate of adverse reactions, relapse rate and costs of CE infection. During January 2012 to February 2014, the Pavia centre entered the majority of the data, while the other cen - tres entered only minimal demographic data. This was probably due to the fact that the Pavia centre is a pilot centre for RIEC implementation and is a WHO collabo - rating centre. Downloadable tools that facilitate data collection and entry, e.g. online tutorials and paper-based report forms for data collection during routine practice, are provided. However, more effort is needed from the project group to encourage data entry and highlight the advantages of using the RIEC, even for individual clinicians. Indeed, the RIEC allows system - atic recording of data and of the clinical management of patients, even those followed in more than one cen - tre. It also allows clinicians to retrieve and analyse the centre's cumulative clinical data for internal use and publications. Additionally, data collection and entry is not very time consuming: in Pavia, human resources allocated to this task were calculated as less than 0.02 full-time equivalents for 2013. The fact that data entry relies on the clinician's good - will and time suggests that the current figures are far from representing the real national situation. Only com - pulsory notification of CE would provide more reliable data for surveillance of the disease in humans. A cen - tralised registry eliminates the need to merge regional data, avoids data duplication, captures both inpatient and outpatient data, and makes both clinical and epi - demiological data accessible to clinicians, epidemiolo - gists and health authorities. This is also of particular importance in light of increasing migration. It is crucial to inform control measures for what is essentially a preventable disease, and to allow for better resource allocation. The preliminary data from the RIEC pre - sented here show that CE is still present in Italy and the cases largely outnumber the total of national cases reported by most European endemic countries [17], fur - ther stressing the need for a better reporting system for CE at the European level. HERACLES (Human cystic Echinococcosis ReseArch in CentraL and Eastern Societies) is a four-year collabo - rative project launched in October 2013, funded by the European Union, under the Seventh Framework Programme (grant agreement number 602051). Within HERACLES, the RIEC has been be the template for the creation of the European registry of cystic echinococ - cosis, with initial inclusion of data from Bulgaria, Italy, Romania and Turkey, while health centres from other European countries expressed an interest in joining [29]. The European registry was launched in September 2014, is available in English and national languages, and is subject to constant monitoring and evaluation and template optimisation. This tool provides an effi - cient and disease-tailored template to governments, the European Commission and related European agen - cies to harmonise data collection, monitoring and reporting of CE.
