Yao Ex-officio J. CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014 III 2014 is well under way, and the AAEP schedule for the year is nothing short of exciting and ambitious. Your association is focused on many aspects of veterinary medicine that affect you and your practice. We are engaged in legislative issues such as the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act - currently in the House of Representatives - and the Prevent All Soring Tactics Act; industry ini-tiatives such as uniformity in racing and medication issues involving numerous per-formance disciplines; and events where horses are used for entertain-ment purposes, including the Carriage Horse issue in New York City that we are following closely. This also marks the first year of \"AAEP Touch,\" the strategic program designed to help you build stronger relationships with your clients by delivering the services and personal qualities they value most in equine veterinary care. The governance changes that began three years ago are creating opportunities for every member who wants to participate in the association to do so. The Rounds e-mail discussion lists enable every member to have a voice and to engage in their area of interest. There are 16 different online Rounds in which you can participate, covering topics ranging from podiatry to parenting. You can find all of the Rounds options in the My AAEP section of aaep.org. The Rounds were established as a conduit for communi- cation and education amongst members interested in specific areas of practice. They are intended to be a con-versation amongst members and, by and large, have been successful from that perspective. That said, they are not without some issues that can be easily remedied. For example, some members are reluctant to participate for fear of being chastised or viewed as being inferior. Others are reluctant to participate due to some of the perceived strong personalities that post on the Rounds, and prefer not to get into a debate in a public forum. We should identify our individual comfort level on the Rounds without com-promising their intent. When participating in the Rounds, we must all remember to honor a code of respect and colle- giality for one another. The Rounds are a faceless discussion; however, everyone in this association is due equal respect from their peers, and that respect should be delivered and guaranteed prior to hitting the \"send\" button. Case discussions are often the topic of interest during the Rounds discussions and provide a tremendous learning opportunity for many members. The willingness to share information - and the dialogue that often ensues - is a valuable educational oppor-tunity for us all. Because of the recent changes in technology and governance within the AAEP, I encourage each of you to become more involved. You can do so by updating your personal profile on the website, engaging in the Rounds discus-sions that interest you or filling out your volunteer interest form in order to contribute more to the AAEP in a specific role. The AAEP is about members who share a common passion and interest - the horse. I invite you to become involved and see what your association has to offer you. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. In closing, I'd like to circle back to the AAEP's schedule for 2014, which also includes construction of a new headquarters at the Kentucky Horse Park. The project, which has been mentioned previously in this publication and during the last two conventions, was initially approved by the AAEP's board of directors in 2008. Complications with land use at the Kentucky Horse Park, which is a state-owned facility, delayed the project for several years. In the meantime, however, the AAEP had been contributing money to a building fund each year. Between these funds and proceeds from the future sale of its current building, the AAEP expects to be in a position to cover approximately 70 percent of the construction costs. Contractors broke ground in January, and construction is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2014. The AAEP will provide regular updates on the progress of its new headquarters in future issues of EVE. From the President's Desk: Collegiality essential to an open and inviting association Dr. Jeff Blea By Jeff Blea, DVM \"The Rounds are a faceless discussion; however, everyone in this association is due equal respect from their peers, and that respect should be delivered and guaranteed prior to hitting the 'send' button.\"IV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014 The AAEP board of directors met February 5 to discuss organizational priorities for the coming year, strategic plan progress, and items resulting from the various working group meetings at the 2013 Annual Convention. The meeting included extensive discussion of the status of the current strategic plan goals. Goals relative to continuing education and governance change implemen-tation are nearing completion for this planning cycle. The AAEP Touch initiative, which was launched at the convention, is likely to be a multi-year project that exceeds the lifecycle of the current strategic plan. Considering the number and extent of the association's current projects, the board deferred the next strategic planning session, which normally would have been scheduled to occur in July, to 2015. (AAEP traditionally has re-cast its strategic plan every three years.) Treasurer Dr. Jim Morehead provided an update on the financing plan for the new AAEP headquarters building. A number of members have contacted the office seeking opportunities to participate with the new construction from a legacy standpoint. The AAEP Foundation staff plan to develop a menu of opportunities for those individuals wishing to participate. During the meeting, the board took action on the following recommendations: 1. The board approved two recommendations from the Welfare and Public Policy Advisory Council: (1) To take a position of \"active pursuit of defeat\" of the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2013; and (2) To approve the position statement for Equids Used in Entertainment, Shows, and for Exhibition, which will appear in the 2014 Membership Directory and Resource Guide. 2. The board approved a recommendation by the Leadership Development Committee to allow this group to identify members seeking volunteer service positions within AVMA. 3. The board approved a recommendation by the Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee to send a letter to the FDA in support of Merial's proposal to formulate a tablet form of firocoxib for the horse. 4. The board approved two recommendations from the National Equine Health Plan Task Force: (1) To approve the business plan developed by the task force; and (2) to approve utilizing the AAEP office to house any individuals working for this industry initiative. 5. The board approved several recommendations from the Scope of Practice Task Force: (1) To remove the Guidelines for Veterinarian/Farrier Professional Conduct from the Membership Directory until substantial revisions could be made; (2) To develop and implement an advocacy training program for members on those scope of practice issues affecting the profession; and (3) To replace the current Guidelines for Referral Cases in the Membership Directory with the previously adopted version submitted by the joint ACVIM/ACVS/AAEP Task Force on Referral Guidelines. 6. The board approved recommendations from the Student Programming Task Force to provide continued funding for the student programming enhancements at the summer Focus meeting and Annual Convention in 2014. The next scheduled meeting of the board will occur at the Focus meeting in Louisville, Ky., in July. AAEP board focuses on 2014 priorities, moves on working group recommendations David Foley By David Foley, AAEP Executive Director Social Media Practice Tip: Facebook as a client communication tool Facebook is the main social media platform we use in our practice. We get the most value by posting 3 to 5 times a day. Clients really like seeing before and after photos and look to it as an educational resource. Since we started with Facebook we found that we have added more value to our practice leading to more client loyalty and an opportunity for new clients to find us. Facebook \"To Do\" For You: Change your Facebook Page cover photo to align with the season or a special time of the year. It is a good place to write messages too, like Happy 4th of July, or Call Us for Equine Lameness.By Scott Spaulding, DVM EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014 V More than 100 practitioners merge education and vacation at Resort Symposium With much of North America firmly in the clutches of Old Man Winter, 110 practitioners escaped to the tropics Feb. 6-8 for the AAEP's 16 th Annual Resort Symposium in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. The turnout matched the record attendance set in 2007 when the meeting was held in Los Cabos, Mexico. Against a canvas of warm Atlantic waters and the lush El Yunque rainforest, attendees soaked up education and relaxation at this unique meeting. The Symposium's three half-day sessions featured lectures, interactive discussions and case discussions centered on the topics of medicine, reproduction, and surgery and lameness. If a tropical respite from the cold and snow sounds appealing, dig through your closet for a Hawaiian shirt and mark your calendar for Jan. 28-30, 2015, when the Resort Symposium heads to the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel on the Big Island of Hawaii. Additional information about the 2015 Resort Symposium will be announced later this year. Bayer HealthCare Animal Health has been the sole sponsor of the Resort Symposium since its inception, and the AAEP thanks Bayer for its continued support of equine continuing education. Resort Symposium attendees relax at the welcome reception.Touch Point: Your clients want you to offer more services - really It's true: AAEP market research revealed that 20 percent of your clients would use you more if you offered more services. This is extremely positive news for equine practice. How do you identify the services your clients wish you provided?r\u0001Ask your clients. Client satisfaction surveys that are sent post-visit or annually can be the tool through which you learn what your clients want. r\u0001Analyze the feedback. Surveys only prove useful when someone in the practice is dedicated to evaluating the responses. Online survey tools like SurveyMonkey are cost effective, tabulate the responses for you and make the process simple. The human brain trust in the practice will still need to determine what the survey data may mean for your mix of client services. r\u0001To add or not to add, that is the question. If your data reveals specific services your clients would like you to offer, then a cost-benefit analysis is your next step. Offering a new service may require staff training, purchasing a new piece of equipment or hiring a veteri-narian with the required skill set. There are simple formulas that can help you determine if the benefit in terms of revenue exceeds the cost of adding the service to your menu. The Touch program has the easy-to-use tools you need to survey your clients. Visit touch.aaep.org to choose from three types of client surveys as well as download step-by-step instructions for using a survey in your practice. The Touch program is available exclusively to AAEP members. VI EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014 Encourage client knowledge by linking to AAEP articles and brochures The AAEP's Horse Owner website is a valuable edu- cational resource through which your clients can enhance their knowledge of equine health. Among the resources available at www.aaep.org/horseowner are transcripts of Ask the Vet sessions dating to January 2012, the ability to submit questions for upcoming Ask the Vet sessions, and an assortment of articles and brochures on pertinent horse health topics. A number of AAEP members share these articles and brochures on their own websites. While we appreciate the proactive approach and encourage use of this information, we ask instead that you link to the AAEP website for these materials. By doing so, your clients will be reading the most up-to-date version because all articles and brochures on the website are peer reviewed regularly, and updated when necessary, to ensure their timeliness and accuracy. For additional information about the AAEP's Horse Owner website, please contact Dana Kirkland, industry education and development coordinator, at dkirkland@aaep.org.

EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014 VII Investing in the potential for a brighter future for laminitic horses Practitioner embraces Laminitis Research Project, encourages increased participation The stress that laminitis imposes collectively on the horse, horse owners and practitioners galvanized Dr. Kathleen McCarthy's enthusiasm for A Case-Control Study of Pasture and Endocrinopathy-Associated Laminitis (PEAL) in Horses, the initial study in the AAEP Foundation's Laminitis Research Project series. An associate veterinarian with Clark Fork Veterinary Clinic in Deer Lodge, Mont., Dr. McCarthy recently discussed her participation in the study - through case and control submissions - and its significance to her and the industry. The objective of the study is to identify risk factors for the development of PEAL that will guide research studies of the pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of new cases of laminitis. The goal is to collect data on 200 laminitis cases and 400 controls by the end of 2014. As of Feb. 24, 136 laminitis cases had been submitted, along with 120 healthy controls and 96 lameness controls. Any new case of laminitis - with the exception of cases due to grain overload, sepsis or lameness in the contralateral limb - evaluated within four weeks of the onset of clinical signs is eligible for inclusion in the study. The study is supported in partnership by the AAEP Foundation; Prascend \u00ae (pergolide mesylate), manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc.; and the USA Equestrian Trust. Discuss the challenges that laminitis presents for veterinarians, horses and horse owners. Laminitis is a frustrating disease for everyone involved, particularly because we do not always know what triggers an episode. The horses end up in pain, and all we can do is manage their symptoms and hope for the best. Meanwhile, many owners want to know what they did wrong and how they can prevent this problem in the future. Aside from colic, I have found laminitis to be the most feared disease among clients. Both colic and laminitis may be caused by many things, and can be mild and easily treated, or can be fatal. Why did you decide to participate in this study? Even though I am not in academia, I wanted to help contribute to a better understanding of one of the most dreaded equine maladies. By participating in this study, I hope to help the entire veterinary community and the horses and people we serve, even if it is in a small way. What has your participation in the study entailed?I have discussed this study with several clients and all have been very willing to participate. The measurements and blood draw are fairly quick and simple. There is a questionnaire that takes a little time to complete. Overall, the process is fairly easy, especially after you take a few samples, and all the materials you need are provided. For each laminitis case you submit, you also need to submit a questionnaire and blood from a lame horse and a healthy horse. The most difficult part of the study is finding a horse that fits the lame control criteria, but hoof abscesses usually fit the criteria well. Why should other equine practitioners participate?This research is greatly needed, and each case is valuable. The study is intended to be large so there is better statistical validity. Many of my clients wanted to participate so they can indirectly help other horses in the future. If some information is gained, it could change the way we manage laminitic horses, and that will benefit everyone. What do you hope to learn as a result of this and subsequent studies in the Laminitis Research Project series?I hope that a better understanding of laminitis will grant equine veterinarians greater confidence and success in the prevention and management of laminitis in the future. This would be better for the horses, and that is what we are all about anyway, right? To learn more about the study, or to register or submit data, please visit www.vetmed.tamu.edu/laminitis or contact the study coordinator, Dr. Michelle Coleman, at mcoleman@cvm.tamu.edu or (979) 219-3523. Dr. Kathleen McCarthy As your AAEP representa- tives in the AVMA House of Delegates (HoD), Dr. Stuart Brown and I work closely with the AAEP leadership to ensure that we serve as a unified voice for the AAEP and represent the equine perspective within the principal governing body of the AVMA. The HoD is comprised of one delegate and one alternate delegate from each of the Principle Veterinary Organizations represented in the HoD, which includes each state, the District of Columbia, territory and U.S. possession; select Constituent Allied Veterinary Organizations such as AAEP; the Uniformed Services Organizations; and the Student AVMA. The HoD convenes twice a year to discuss issues pertaining to the profession and vote on resolutions that determine AVMA positions and policies. Many of the high-profile issues affecting the veterinary profession are equine related, particularly in the area of welfare. Therefore, maintaining a strong collaborative atmosphere between our two organizations is vital to the health and longevity of each. Exemplifying the synergy between our organizations, AVMA looks to AAEP as a respected source of all things equine and we look to the AVMA to get our message across in a much larger scale and with the weight of an entire umbrella organization. By working together with the AVMA Governmental Relations Division (GRD) and the AVMA leadership, the voice of the equine practitio-ner is being heard effectively. For example, AVMA executive vice president and CEO Dr. Ron DeHaven testified Nov. 12, 2013, during a Congressional sub-committee meeting concerning the Prevent All Soring Tactics Act (H.R. 1518). After consulting the AAEP, Dr. DeHaven's testimony reflected the views of the veterinary community and, especially, the equine veterinary community. Further, the GRD was instrumental in the Senate's passage of the Veterinary Medicine Mobility Act (S. 1171), which allows veterinarians to carry controlled substances outside of their primary places of registration. A House version of this bill has been introduced (H.R. 1528) and the GRD is working diligently to ensure that we, as equine practitioners, can continue to practice without needless restrictions. These are just a few examples of how our two organiza- tions are working together. Dr. Brown and I serve as a link that will hopefully continue to strengthen this bond. We encourage all AAEP members to reach out to us if you have an opinion or concern with an AVMA resolution or policy or if you would like to share any ideas on how we can represent our fellow AAEP members more effectively. I can be reached at cvg8198@msn.com and Dr. Brown at sbrown@hagyard.com. Dr. MacKenzie is senior equine technical services veteri- narian for Merck Animal Health and a member of both the AAEP's Welfare and Public Policy Advisory Council and Leadership Development Committee.

Highlights of recent clinically relevant papers Doppler ultrasonography in horses with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or laminitis This study by Carla Aguirre and colleagues in Spain evaluates the usefulness of Doppler ultrasonography as a method to assess changes in digital vascular dynamics in horses with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or laminitis. In this cross-sectional study, 42 adult Andalusian horses were divided into 4 groups: Group 1 consisted of 9 healthyhorses, Group 2 consisted of 19 horses with SIRS (10 with apalpable increase in digital pulse intensity and 9 without), andGroup 3 consisted of 14 horses with laminitis (6 withradiographic evidence of rotation or distal displacement of the third phalanx and 8 without). Qualitative spectrum characteristics and quantitative Doppler measurements of thelateral palmar digital artery were obtained for horses in eachgroup. Four spectra, characterised by a positive systolic peakfollowed by several positive diastolic peaks, were observed inGroup 1 and Group 2 horses, and Group 3 horses withoutradiographic changes. In the Group 3 horses withradiographic changes, laminar blood flow was detected.Diameter of the lateral palmar digital artery was significantlylarger in the Group 3 horses than in the Group 2 horses; bloodflow was significantly higher in the Group 2 horses with anincrease in digital pulse intensity than in the Group 2 horseswithout an increase in digital pulse intensity; velocity-timeintegral and acceleration time were significantly lower inGroup 3 horses, compared with Group 2 horses. The authorsconcluded that Doppler ultrasonography may be a usefulcomplementary tool to detect digital blood flow changes ofhorses with SIRS, especially if they have a palpable increase indigital pulse intensity, or laminitis. Colic in equine neonates This retrospective case study by Melissa MacKinnon andcolleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, USA, aimed todocument causes of colic in equine neonates, evaluateclinical features of neonates managed medically vs.surgically, determine short- and long-term survival rates forneonates with specific medical and surgical lesions, and assessability of patients to achieve intended use. Case details including history, results of physical examination and diagnostic tests, treatment, primarydiagnosis, concurrent diseases and short-term survival ratewere obtained from the medical records of 137 equineneonates ( <30 days old) with a history of colic or signs of colic within 1 h following hospital admission. Long-term follow-upinformation was obtained through phone survey. The majority (89%) of neonates were managed medically. The 3 most common diagnoses associated with colic wereenterocolitis (27%), meconium-associated colic (20%), andtransient medical colic (19%). The reason forsurgery was small intestinal strangulating obstruction, andthese neonates were more likely to have severe, continuouspain and were less responsive to analgesics. Concurrentdiseases were common (64%) but did not significantly impactsurvival rate. Short-term survival rate was not significantlydifferent between medically (75%) and surgically (73%)managed neonates. Long-term survival rate was excellent(93%) for horses that survived to hospital discharge. Most neonates surviving to maturity were used as intended (83%). The authors concluded that most neonates examined for signsof colic can be managed medically. Short-term survival rate inmedically and surgically treated neonates was good, with anexcellent long-term survival rate for foals discharged from thehospital, with most achieving intended use. Equine pastern vasculitis Dimitra Psalla and colleagues in Europe have published thisretrospective study which aimed to establish histopathologicalcriteria for pastern vasculitis, to look for an underlying cause, toinvestigate whether the histopathological lesions areassociated with a distinct clinical picture, to assess if and how the clinical picture varies, and to determine the treatment response. Skin biopsies and clinical data from 20 horses with a diagnosis of vasculitis of the distal extremities wereinvestigated and histology was compared with biopsies fromhealthy horses. Intramural inflammatory cells, leukocytoclasiawith nuclear dust, thickening and oedema of the vessel walls,and microhaemorrhages were found to be highly specifichistological findings in equine pastern vasculitis. Lesions weremostly seen on the lateral and medial aspects of unpigmentedlegs. Lesions in white skin were characterised by exudation andcrusts, whereas those in pigmented skin were alopecic andcharacterised by scaling. The response to treatment was poorand the prognosis guarded. No association was foundbetween any of the histopathological findings and a distinctclinical picture. An underlying cause of equine pasternvasculitis could not be identified. The causative agents aredifficult to identify, but may involve drugs or a hypersensitivityreaction to yet unknown antigens. Risk factors for equine laminitis Claire Wylie and colleagues in the UK and Australia haverecently performed a case-control study examining the riskfactors for equine laminitis in horses and ponies in Great Britain. There have been few high-quality studies investigating risk factors for equine laminitis, and only a limited number of riskfactors have been previously investigated. This case-controlstudy investigated risk factors for active episodes ofveterinary-diagnosed laminitis in horses and ponies attendedby veterinary practitioners in Great Britain, based onmultivariable statistical analyses. Questionnaires werereceived for 1010 animals, comprising 191 laminitis cases and819 controls. Factors associated with an increased risk oflaminitis were weight gain in the previous 3 months, summerand winter months compared to spring, new access to grass inthe previous 4 weeks, box rest in the previous week,owner-reported history of laminitis, lameness and increasing time since the last anthelmintictreatment. Factors associated with a decreased risk of laminitiswere increasing height, feeding of additional supplements inthe previous week and transportation in the previous week.113 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014Highlights from the AAEP 59th Annual Convention Two of the following articles were presented at the AAEP Annual Convention held in Nashville, USA, in December 2013.

Fayrer-Hosken the effects of ergot alkaloids fromendophyte-infected tall fescue grass on stallion reproductivefunctions. This study was presented at the AAEP Convention inDecember 2013. Six stallions were fed either toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue seed or a non-toxic tall fescue seed. Blood samplingand breeding soundness were checked at regular intervals. The authors found that ergot alkaloids decreased the gel-free volume in the stallion's ejaculate but there were no significantchanges in sperm motility, sperm concentration, sperm cellmorphology, total number of sperm cells, number of breedingdoses, testicular volume or testosterone levels. that ingested ergot alkaloid fromendophyte-infected spermiogram. Blood lactate concentrations in critically ill neonatal foals A. Borchers and colleagues from equine hospitals and universities worldwide have evaluated blood lactateconcentrations in critically ill neonatal foals to find out whetherthese concentrations can be used as a prognostic indicator.This study was presented at the AAEP Convention inDecember 2013. In this large multi-centre study blood lactate concentrations from 643 foals were measured at admissionthen at 24, 48, 72 and 120 hours after admission and theresulting data were analysed. It was found that lactateconcentration is a strong, independent biomarker to predictmortality in critically ill foals. Lactate metabolism is impaired innon-surviving and septic foals and lactate changes over timecan be used to identify patients that are at high risk ofmortality. Assessing diagnostic anaesthesia of the foot S. Maliye and colleagues from the University of Glasgow, UK,have reported the use of an inertial sensor-based system todistinguish between a positive and negative response todiagnostic anaesthesia of the foot and assess the effect of apositive response on the trot. Data from lameness investigations in which a palmar digital or abaxial sesamoid nerve block was performedwere reviewed. Response to analgesia was assessed,measurements were taken and the resulting data wereanalysed. The inertial sensor-system was able to identify apositive response to diagnostic anaesthesia of the foot.Symmetry of movement allocated to the blocked limb, contralateral forelimb and hindlimb significantly improved,and head movement significantly decreased following apositive response. A positive response to diagnostic analgesiais associated with significant and measurable changes inmovement symmetry. Cut-off values for a positive responsehave been identified with good sensitivity and specificity. Forelimb lameness significantly affects contralateral hindlimb movement, which has implications for the investigation ofmulti-limb lameness. Oxidative stress in R. equi pneumonia J. Crowley and colleagues in Australia have reported on the significance of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of Rhodococcus equi pneumonia. Various oxidative stress biomarkers were measured from blood and exhaled breath condensate from 26 foals from farms affected by R. equi pneumonia. Foals were determined as cases (positive) or controls (negative) basedon ultrasonographic evidence of pulmonary absessation.Haematology and biochemistry testing was performed, andbiomarkers and key haematological and biochemical markersof inflammation between groups were compared. Derivativesof reactive oxygen metabolites, the oxidative stress index andhydrogen peroxide concentrations in the exhaled breathcondensate were all found to be greater in cases. Traditionalmeasures of inflammation showed no difference between the2 groups. Oxydative stress may be a useful marker of early orsubclinical R. equi pneumonia. S.

Equine oncology is becoming an increasingly important subject, inpart due to the growing proportion of geriatric animals in thegeneral horse population, and in part due to advances inhuman oncology and increased expectations of horse ownersto treat horses affected by neoplasia. However, despite this increased awareness and importance, the development of this area of equine medicine faces several major hurdles, notleast of which is the relatively low incidence of neoplasia inhorses when compared with other species including peopleand small animals. Other than cutaneous tumours, neoplasia inthe horse is relatively uncommon, and many specific tumoursare very rare. As a result, our experience and knowledge ofmany tumours is extremely limited. Even specialist oncology centres will diagnose and treat relatively few cases, which hinders advances in diagnosis and treatment. Large scalerandomised clinical trials are commonplace in human andeven small animal oncology, but are rarely feasible in equinemedicine. Although advanced imaging techniques mayimprove the ability to diagnose some neoplastic disorders inthe horse, the sheer size of our patients is a major barrier toallowing identification of metastases or staging of tumours. Thelow incidence of neoplasia and the difficulties in establishingclinical trials as a result means that our ability to treat tumours is also often extremely limited. Costs associated with implementing treatments in large animals are a further issue. Equine Veterinary Education is committed to publishing case reports and case series, at a time when many otherjournals have moved away from doing this. In terms ofevidence-based medicine, case reports are considered torepresent a low level of evidence. However, we consider thatcase reports are vitally important sources of information inequine medicine, especially in diseases such as neoplasia thatare uncommon and where higher levels of evidence do notexist (such as meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and observational studies). Case reports are descriptive studies that cannot be used to measure risk, causation, treatment effects or prevalence of disease.However, they can add significantly to the limited body ofinformation on uncommon diseases, and indeed may bethe only documented sources of information available toclinicians when faced with trying to manage similar clinical conditions. Although textbooks and expert opinion may provide other sources of information in such situations, theseoften vary in their quality and will almost always include somebias, reflecting the authors' experience, opinion andinterpretation of the evidence. We are pleased to announce the publication of two online issues of Equine Veterinary Education devoted to equine oncology. The first 'virtual' issue contains a selection of new, previously unpublished case reports and case series describing many neoplastic diseases and their management, as well asassociated clinical commentaries that expand the discussionaround certain topics relating to the case reports. This issue hasbeen made freely available online to all readers. The secondonline issue is a collection of oncology-related articles thathave previously been published in the journal, including casereports, clinical commentaries and review articles. The reviewarticles in this issue are also freely available to all readers, butthe other articles are only available free to subscribers to the journal. Further articles will be added to this issue following their publication in the journal in the future, thereby allowing thisresource to evolve and grow. We hope that by bringingtogether all of these articles we will develop a unique anddefinitive source of reference for clinicians on equineneoplasia.

MAIR EVE Editor115 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014Case Report Bilateral ceratohyoidectomy for the resolution of clinical signsassociated with temporohyoid osteoarthropathy J. J. Bras *,E .Davis and W. L. Beard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, Clinical Sciences, Equine Department, Kansas State University, Kansas, USA. Temporohyoid osteoarthropathy (THO) is a progressive bilateral disease of unknown aetiology that most commonly affects adulthorses. Irrespective of aetiology, THO frequently results in pain orfracture of the petrous temporal bone during normal movementof the tongue and larynx. In an effort to decrease pain and reduce the likelihood of petrous temporal bone fracture, partial stylohyoidectomy and ceratohyoidectomy have beendeveloped. Serious complications have been reported followingstylohyoidectomy and therefore the current recommendationis to perform unilateral ceratohyoidectomy. Benefits ofceratohyoidectomy include a lower risk of vascular and nervedamage and a reduced risk of clinical signs recurrence whencompared with stylohyoidectomy. This report describes a case ofTHO in which clinical signs recurred approximately 2 years afterunilateral ceratohyoidectomy was performed. Due to thiscomplication, resection of the contralateral ceratohyoid bone wasperformed, which resulted in complete resolution of clinical signs.Although the clinical signs are frequently unilateral, the disease ismost commonly a progressive bilateral condition and some horsesmay not have complete resolution of clinical signs when unilateralceratohyoidectomy is performed. Therefore, if clinical signs persistafter unilateral ceratohyoidectomy, a therapeutic considerationshould include bilateral ceratohyoidectomy. This report suggests afavourable short-term prognosis for a horse treated with bilateralceratohyoidectomy. Introduction Ankylosis of the temporohyoid joint (THJ) is a progressivebilateral disease of unknown aetiology that most commonlyaffects adult horses (Naylor et al . 2010). Suggested aetiologies of temporohyoid osteoarthropathy (THO) include primarydegenerative joint disease, inflammation of the inner/middleear secondary to a haematogenous infection, nonsepticosteoarthritis and trauma caused by fracture of the petroustemporal bone (Power et al . al . 2004; Divers et al . 2006). However, at the present time, these pathogeneses remain speculative. Irrespective of theaetiology, the end-result is ankylosis of the THJ which frequentlyresults in pain or fracture of the petrous temporal bone duringnormal movement of the tongue and larynx (Power et al . 1983; Blythe . 2004; Divers et al . 2006). Clinical signs associated with THO include head shaking, difficulty masticating food, reluctance to 'take' the bit,resistance to external digital palpation and nonspecificbehavioural problems when ridden. Clinical proceduresassociated with exacerbation of clinical disease include oralexamination and nasogastric intubation (Power al . Pease et al 2004; Divers et al . 2006). Once the THJ has ankylosed, normal forces generated by movementof the tongue and larynx (swallowing, vocalising, etc) mayresult in fracture(s) of the petrous temporal bone resulting inacute onset of facial and vestibulocochlear nerve deficits(Power al . 2004; Divers et al . 2006). In an effort to decrease pain associated with THO andreduce the likelihood of petrous temporal bone fracture,partial stylohyoidectomy and ceratohyoidectomy have beendescribed, with the latter being a more contemporary surgicalprocedure and preferred by equine surgeons (Blythe et al . Pease et al . 2004; Divers et al . 2006). Both surgical procedures are aimed at decreasing forces placed on theankylosed THJ, thereby decreasing pain and reducingmorbidity associated with fractures of the petrous temporalbone (Divers et al . 2006). Due to the reported complications with partial stylohyoidectomy (transient dysphagia, injury to the lingual artery and hypoglossal nerve,permanentprehension problems when performed bilaterallyand recurrence of clinical signs due to regrowth of thestylohyoid bone), ceratohyoidectomy is the preferred surgicalprocedure al . 2004; Divers et al . 2006; Freeman and Hardy 2006). Advantages of ceratohyoidectomy include aneasier surgical approach and a lack of bone regrowthresulting in permanent removal of forces exerted on theankylosed THJ (Divers et al . 2006; Freeman and Hardy 2006). Reported complications of a ceratohyoidectomy includedamage to the linguofacial vein, hypoglossal nerve lingual nerve al . 2004; Divers et al . 2006; Freeman and Hardy 2006). To the authors' knowledge,recurrence of clinical signs after ceratohyoidectomy has notpreviously been reported. This report describes a clinical case of THO in which clinical signs recurred approximately 2 years after unilateralceratohyoidectomy was performed. Due to this complication,resection of the contralateral ceratohyoid bone wasperformed with complete resolution of the clinical signs. To theauthor's knowledge, bilateral ceratohyoidectomy has notpreviously been reported. Case details A 17-year-old Mustang gelding was presented to KSU-VMTHwith a 3 day history of compulsive circling to the left andmoderate to severe headshaking associated with masticationof long-stem roughage. The horse also had a head-tilt towardsthe left side when eating. A complete dental examinationwas performed and revealed no abnormalities. Neurological116 \u00a9 2012 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014examination did not reveal any neurological deficits. Skull radiographs and guttural pouch endoscopy revealedirregularity and asymmetric thickening more severe on the left ( Figs 1a and b). These findings confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral THO. A left-sidedceratohyoidectomy was performed to decrease painassociated with ankylosis of the THJ and to reduce thelikelihood of acute temporal bone fracture. Within 48 h of surgery, the violent headshaking completely resolved. The horse was discharged from the VMTH and returned to a normallevel of activity that included light pleasure riding. Two years post operatively, the horse was again presented to KSU-VMTH with a one day history of recurrence of clinicalsigns (headshaking and head turn to the left in association witheating roughage) (Video S1). Endoscopy of the gutturalpouches revealed progressive asymmetrical thickening of the proximal aspects of the stylohyoid bones (left more severe than right). In an effort to determine the origin of the pain induced by eating long-stem roughage, interruption of afferent input wasachieved by instillation of lidocaine into each aural canal,followed by offering fresh hay to see if clinical signs remainedpresent while masticating forage. The left and right auralcanals were separately infused with 35 ml 2% lidocaineresulting in 80 and 100% improvement of clinical signs,respectively. Overall health status was assessed by haematological evaluation. A complete blood count was within normal limitswith the exception of mild anaemia (28%, normal 32-40%).Based on the progression of THO, the horse was treatedmedically with phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h) and trimethroprim/sulphamethoxazole (15 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h). The goal of therapy was to medically address bothinflammation and the possibility of an infectious otitis media . Dietary recommendations included a complete pelleted diet(Equine Senior) 1. Two weeks after medical therapy was initiated, the horse presented to the VMTH with no improvement of clinical signs.At this time a computed tomographic (CT) examination wasperformed in an effort to completely evaluate thetemporohyoid articulations and previous surgery site. Apotential concern was that mineralisation of the originalsurgery site may have contributed to the recurrence of clinicalsigns. However, CT examination did not reveal a mineralizationin the gap between the left stylohyoid and left margin of thebasihyoid bone where the left ceratohyoid bone had beenpreviously removed ( Fig 2a ). There was moderate-to-severe sclerosis and irregular new bone in the region of thetemporohyoid articulations bilaterally ( Fig 2b ). The CT findings confirmed the previous diagnosis of bilateralmoderate-to-severe THO with bilateral chronic otitis externa . The owner decided that if improvement in clinical signs could not be achieved, then the overall quality of life was sopoor that she was considering euthanasia. The authorsbelieved that removal of the right ceratohyoid bonecould potentially improve clinical signs since there wasdemonstrable evidence of bilateral disease, based on findingsfrom placement of aural analgesia. Therefore, a second surgical procedure was offered. Surgical procedure A ceratohyoidectomy was performed as described by Pease et al . (2004). Briefly, the horse was positioned in dorsalrecumbency and the ventral laryngeal region prepared aseptically. A 10-15 cm paramedian skin incision was made medial to the right linguofacial vein starting approximately2 cm caudal to the basihyoid bone and extending to therostral surface of the right ceratohyoid bone. Thesternohyoideus muscle fibres were bluntly separated until thearticulation between the basihyoid with the ceratohyoid bonewas exposed. The basihyoid-ceratohyoid joint wasdisarticulated with a scalpel and the free end of the ceratohyoid bone grasped with Backhaus towel clamp. The ceratohyoideus, hyoideus transverses and genioglossus muscles were bluntly dissected to expose the lateral and rostral aspect of the ceratohyoid bone. These muscles were carefully dissected to identify and isolate the hypoglossalnerve and branches of the lingual nerve on the lateraland rostral surface of the ceratohyoid bone. Theceratohyoid-stylohyoid articulation was then identified anddisarticulated with mayo scissors followed by removal of theceratohyoid bone. ceratohyoid, hyoglossus muscles were of the basihyoid The subcutaneous tissues were then apposed usingabsorbable suture in a simple continuous pattern and the skinwith stainless-steel staples. Within 48 h following removal of the right ceratohyoid bone the horse was once again able to comfortably consumelong-stem roughage without evidence of a head turn or toss(Video S2). The horse was discharged from the VMTH 72 h postoperatively and within 1 month resumed his regular level ofpleasure riding exercise. In a telephone interview, 10 monthspost operatively, the owner reported that the horse remainssymptom free without signs of headshaking and head turn tothe left in association with eating roughage, and has returnedto his previous level of performance. Also, the horse did notmake any abnormal upper respiratory noise after surgery. Discussion To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report wherebilateral ceratohyoidectomy safely resulted in resolution ofclinical disease. The hyoid apparatus supports the tongue, pharynx and larynx with most movement occurring in a rostral-caudaldirection at the stylohyoid-ceratohyoid joint (Pease et al . 2004). Therefore, when the THJ fuses, the normal forcesgenerated by movement of the tongue and larynx can leadto fracture(s) of the petrous temporal bone resulting inthe acute onset of facial and vestibulocochlear nerve deficits(Power al . 2004; Divers et al . 2006). To reduce the risk of petrous temporal bone fracture, unilateral partial ostectomy of the stylohyoidbone and ceratohyoidectomy can be performed.Stylohyoidectomy was initially performed in an effort to reducethe forces exerted on the ankylosed THJ. Due to theaforementioned complications following stylohyoidectomy, aceratohyoidectomy procedure was developed in an effort todecrease the incidence of these complications. It has beenreported that a ceratohyoidectomy has a lower risk ofvascular and nerve damage during the surgical approachand a reduced risk of recurrence of clinical signs whencompared with stylohyoidectomy (Divers et al . 2006; Freeman and Hardy 2006). As reported by Divers et al . (2006), there are \u00a9 2012 EVJ Ltd117 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE 2014a) c) d)b) Fig 1: a) Radiographic findings: On the lateral view, there is an ill-defined, irregularly-shaped, triangular mineral opaque structure caudal to the proximal aspect of one of the stylohyoid bones just ventral to the petrous temporal bone (white solid arrow). b) On the dorsoventralview there is asymmetry of the temporohydoid articulations marked by increased bone at the site of the left temporohydoid articulation(black solid arrow). The increased bone at this site prevents visualisation of the joint space. c) and d) Left and right guttural pouch demonstrating that the most proximal aspects of the stylohyoid bones were EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014no case controlled studies that have critically compared the value of these surgical procedures; therefore, reportedoutcomes are limited and anecdotal. Ceratohyoid bone excision is proposed to provide a similar clinical benefit when compared to partial stylohyoidectomyby reducing movement of the THJ and thus reducing the risk ofa petrous temporal bone fracture secondary to THO.Advantages of ceratohyoidectomy have been proposed by Pease et al . (2004) that include removal of the periosteum, which provides osteogenic cells and a framework therebyinhibiting bony union between the basihyoid and stylohyoidbones. In addition, leaving the cartilaginous ends of thebasihyoid and stylohyoid bones will prevent bony union. A reported surgical complication of bilateral stylohyoidectomy is difficulty in prehension post operatively (Freeman and Hardy2006). Therefore, it could be speculated that this complicationcould be encountered with the bilateral removal of theceratohyoid bones since the surgical procedure has beenproposed to function in a similar manner to the partialstylohyoidectomy. Unfortunately, the incidence of thiscomplication cannot be determined from the case reports and small case series reports. In the case reported here, the clinical signs of headshaking were significantly improved after infusion of 2% lidocaine into the ear canals. To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report where clinical signs of headshaking secondary to THOwere significantly reduced by the infusion of lidocaine directlyinto the ear canal. One explanation for this finding is thepossibility of an active infection/inflammation of the earcanals and/or rupture of the tympanic membrane allowingdesensitisation of the inner ear. It is important to mention thatthe value of intra-aural anaesthesia is not established and has not been previously reported. The infusion of lidocaine in this case as an adjunctive diagnostic tool helped the authorsdetermine that a second surgical procedure could provideresolution to the current clinical signs. Endoscopy and radiography have been suggested as the diagnostic modalities of choice for THO; however, CT imaging hasrecently been demonstrated to be superior to conventionalradiographs and endoscopy for the detection of fluid in theexternal ear canal and middle ear due to its image resolution andcross-sectional anatomy (Power et al . 1983; al . 2004; Divers et al . 2006). In the current report, CT was thought not to be necessary on initial examination since skullradiographs and guttural pouch endoscopy were diagnostic forbilateral THO. However, due to the recurrence of clinical signs andno financial constraints, a CT was performed during the secondvisit instead of conventional radiography which provided a more comprehensive evaluation of all structures. This report suggests a favourable prognosis for a horse treated with bilateral ceratohyoidectomy for the treatment ofbilateral THO. Although most horses have evidence of bilateraldisease, clinical signs are usually unilateral and can besuccessfully treated with a unilateral ceratohyoidectomy.Owners should be advised of the possibility of persistence orrecurrence of clinical signs after unilateral ceratohyoidectomyresulting from bilateral disease progression and advised that abilateral ceratohyoidectomy is an option.

See Information for Owner or Person Treating Horse section of this package insert. Treatment with EQUIOXX \u00ae should be terminated if signs such as inappetence, colic, abnormal feces, or lethargy are observed. As a class, cyclooxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse events varies with the individual patient. Patients at greatest risk for adverse events are those that are dehydrated, on diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached or avoided. NSAIDs may inhibit the prostaglandins that maintain normal homeostatic function. Such anti-prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease that has not been previously diagnosed. Since many NSAIDs possess the potential to produce gastrointestinal ulcerations, concomitant use with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided or closely monitored. The concomitant use of protein bound drugs with EQUIOXX \u00ae Oral Paste has not been studied in horses. The influence of concomitant drugs that may inhibit the metabolism of EQUIOXX\u00ae Oral Paste has not been evaluated. Drug compatibility should be monitored in patients requiring adjunctive therapy. The safe use of EQUIOXX \u00ae Oral Paste in horses less than one year in age, horses used for breeding, or in pregnant or lactating mares has not been evaluated. Consider appropriate washout times when switching from one NSAID to another NSAID or corticosteroid. Adverse Reactions: In controlled field studies, 127 horses (ages 3 to 37 years) were evaluated for safety when given EQUIOXX\u00ae Oral Paste at a dose of 0.045 mg/lb (0.1 mg/kg) orally once daily for up to 14 days. The following adverse reactions were observed. Horses may have experienced more than one of the observed adverse reactions during the study. EQUIOXX \u00ae (firocoxib) Oral Paste was safely used concomitantly with other therapies, including vaccines, anthelmintics, and antibiotics, during the field studies. Information for Owner or Person Treating Horse: You should give the Client Information Sheet to the person treating the horse and advise them of the potential for adverse reactions and the clinical signs associated with NSAID intolerance. Adverse reactions may include erosions and ulcers of the gums, tongue, lips and face, weight loss, colic, diarrhea, or icterus. Serious adverse reactions associated with this drug class can occur without warning and, in rare situations, result in death. Clients should be advised to discontinue NSAID therapy and contact their veterinarian immediately if any of these signs of intolerance are observed. The majority of patients with drug-related adverse reactions recover when the signs are recognized, drug administration is stopped, and veterinary care is initiated. Effectiveness: Two hundred fifty-three client-owned horses of various breeds, ranging in age from 2 to 37 years and weighing from 595 to 1638 lbs, were randomly administered EQUIOXX or an active control drug in multi-center field studies. Two hundred forty horses were evaluated for effectiveness and 252 horses were evaluated for safety. Horses were assessed for lameness, pain on manipulation, range of motion, joint sw elling, and overall clinical improvement in a non-inferiority evaluation of EQUIOXX compared to an active control. At study's end, 84. 4% of horses treated with EQUIOXX were judged improved on veterinarians' clinical assessment, and 73.8% were also rated improved by owners. Horses treated with EQUIOXX showed improvement in veterinarian-assessed lameness, pain on manipulation, range of motion, and joint swelling that was comparable to the active control.

Temporohyoid osteoarthropathy is characterised by progressive osseous proliferation of the proximal portion of the stylohyoid and petrous temporal bones,and is generally described as a disease of middle-agedhorses. More recent reports also attribute a variety of clinicalsyndromes in young horses to THO, requiring a diversification ofapproaches to confirm the diagnosis and its significance, andto guide conservative and surgical treatment options. Thiscommentary will review the purported aetiology, clinicalsyndromes, available diagnostic tests and treatment options ofequine THO. Aetiology Temporohyoid osteoarthropathy (THO) is a well-recognisedclinical entity in horses. It is characterised by progressiveosseous proliferation of the proximal portion of the stylohyoidand petrous temporal bones (Walker et al . 2002; Divers al . 2006; Hilton et al . 2009; Palus et al . 2012). It is generally described as a disease of middle-aged horses, although morerecent reports attribute a variety of clinical syndromes in younghorses to THO (Hassel et al . et al . 2013). The aetiology of THO remains unknown, but infectious and traumatic/inflammatory aetiologies are discussed in theveterinary literature (Hassel et al Newton and Knottenbelt al . 2010). Haematogenous spread of infection and local spread from the inner and middle ear havebeen identified in horses with a history of previous respiratorytract infection (Hassel et al . 1995; Walker et al . 2002; Divers et al . 2006). Rarely, an affected horse is febrile or complete blood count parameters indicate bacterial infection at thetime of presentation for THO (Walker et al . 2002; Divers et al . 2006). Others argue that extraordinary or repetitive traumaticevents precede nonseptic degeneration in all or the majorityof cases (Mayhew 2009; Grenager et al . 2010). However, neither traumatic episodes nor preceding infections of theupper respiratory tract are usually reported by caretakers ofaffected horses et al 1999; Palus et al . 2012). More subtle events associated with the use of a mouth gag and forceful tongue manipulations duringdental procedures and oral examinations, or nasogastricintubations have triggered acute clinical manifestations ofTHO (Walker et al . 2002; Palus et al . 2012). Repetitive microtrauma brought about by crib-biting or forcefulphonation has been proposed as an inciting or expeditingfactor for degenerative changes to occur (Grenager et al . 2010; Palus et al . 2012). In this context, it is plausible thatTHO could be a potential long-term complication of the laryngeal tie-forward procedure, but reports of this complication are unknown to the authors. There are different aetiopathogeneses for THO in the horse resulting in similarclinical and imaging manifestations (Hilton et al . 2009). Irrespective of initiating cause, chronic inflammation and pain with subsequent degenerative changes resulting in loss ofmobility of the temporohyoid articulation and ankylosisrepresent the main stages leading to the various clinical signsassociated with THO (Blythe et al . 1994; Divers et al . 2006). Although the natural progression of the disease is unknown, it isthought to be a slowly progressive entity (Hilton et al . 2009; Naylor et al . 2010). Presenting complaints The numerous presenting complaints associated with THO include neurological deficits relating to the vestibulocochlear(vestibular ataxia and/or head tilt) and/or facial nerve(facial nerve paralysis, decreased tear production, cornealulceration, keratitis and facial hyperaesthesia). Rarely, seizuresand sudden death are reported, most likely in cases withconcurrent involvement of the cranium (Walker et al . 2002). Behavioural changes such as headshaking, crib-biting or earrubbing, resentment to placing a bridle, difficulty chewing oreven dysphagia, indicate discomfort and pain localised to theauricular region and dominate the clinical picture in so-called'non-neurological' forms of THO (Divers et al . 2006; Palus et al . 2012). Patients with non-neurological THO are most likely topresent less advanced stages of this progressive, degenerativedisease. In cases with neurological deficits, clinical signs often take a sudden onset due to fracturing of the petrous temporal orstylohyoid bones, which can tear or stretch the facial orvestibulocochlear nerves as they exit the skull or within the skull,respectively (Blythe et al . 1994; Walker et al . 2002). Transient, more severe forms of dysphagia due to damage of theglossopharyngeal and vagal nerve are rare (Divers et al . 2006; Readford et al . 2013). In these cases, it is speculated that concurrent dysfunction of the facial, glossopharyngeal and/or vagal nerve may occur due to a fracture extending into theforamen lacerum (Readford et al . 2013). Neurological signs are most commonly unilateral, although morphologicalchanges detected with advanced imaging modalities maybe present bilaterally in a large proportion of cases (Walkeret al . 2002; Divers et al . 2006; Maher et al . 2008; Hilton et al . 2009). Diagnostic procedures In a clinical setting, THO should be considered whenever anyof the clinical signs mentioned above are observed. A121 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014definitive diagnosis of THO can be made by endoscopy of the guttural pouches (Hassel 2006; Palus et al . 2012), or in more subtle cases by computed tomography (CT) of the head, particularly where this can be performed standing ( Fig 1 ). Enlargement of the proximal stylohyoid boneand/or adjacent articular structures is the consistent diagnostic imaging feature observed with this clinical entity (Walker et al . 2002; Divers et al . 2006; Hilton et al . 2009). Stylohyoid bone enlargement is presumed to occur from theimmobility associated with ankylosis of the temporohyoid articulation and subsequent lack of bony remodelling (Divers et al . 2006). If the examiner is unsure about a potential enlargement of the stylohyoid or temporohyoid articulation,the contralateral side can be used for comparison. It must be kept in mind, however, that disease is frequently bilateral, even though the vast majority of cases present withneurological deficits that are predominantly unilateral (Walkeret al . 2002; Divers et al . 2006; Maher et al . 2008; Hilton et al . 2009). To augment the routine clinical and neurological examination, additional special diagnostic procedures are readily available to equine clinicians, and may be helpful in horses with either neurological or non-neurological signs of THO: 1. Periauricular palpation to assess pain (Divers et al . 2006). 2. Palpation of the basihyoid, including a forceful dorsad manipulation to assess mobility of the hyoid apparatus(Divers et al . 2006). 3. Auricular diagnostic anaesthesia (Bras et al . 2014) potentially in conjunction with et al 1995; Newton and Knottenbelt 1999; Sommerauer et al . 2013). Although these tests are neither very sensitive nor specific for THO, they may contribute relevant information for choosingan adequate treatment plan, as shown in the case report by Bras et al . (2014). This is especially true if advanced imaging techniques such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not available or avoided due to risks associated with general anaesthesia. Effective blocks of the equine ear may be performed either by instilling local anaesthetic into the external ear canal,as described by Bras et al . (2014), or by perineural anaesthesia of the internal and great auricular nerves (McCoy et al . 2007; Sommerauer et al . 2012). In the report by Bras et al . (2014) clinical signs of headshaking were significantly improved afterinfusion of 2% lidocaine into the ear canals. One explanation for this finding is the possibility of active infection or inflammation of the ear canals and/or rupture of the tympanicmembrane allowing desensitisation of the inner ear (Bras et al . 2014). Although the value of intra-aural anaesthesia is not established and has not been reported previously, this case report demonstrates how it may help distinguish unilateral frombilateral involvement and therefore guide therapeutic measures. Brainstem auditory-evoked response (BAER) offers another diagnostic procedure to assess hearing function in horses suffering from THO. In one study, all horses with THO were foundto have either complete (9 of 11 horses) or partial (2 of 11 horses) BAER loss on the most affected side (Aleman et al . 2008). Five out of 9 (56%) horses with imaging evidence of bilateral involvement also had bilateral BAER abnormalities. The association between complete BAER loss and neurologicaland diagnostic imaging abnormalities was statistically significant. Therefore, BAER testing may be a valuablediagnostic procedure to assess functional impairment of the left and right auditory pathway in horses with THO, in order todetermine the indication for bilateral surgical intervention. a) b) S Fig 1: Non-neurological form of temporohyoid osteoarthropathy in a 5-year-old Warmblood eventer.

Highquality latero-lateral and ventro-dorsal projections focusing onthe area of interest are required and are often not diagnostic,even if obtained under general anaesthesia (Hassel et al . Divers et al . 2012). Computed tomography currently offers the most comprehensive assessment of the bony structures of the hyoid apparatus and temporohyoid articulation. Retrospective studies on THO including substantial numbers of horsesexamined by CT have not only revealed that horsespresenting with neurological deficits had significantlyincreased width of the stylohyoid bone compared withsubclinical cases, but also that bilateral proliferative changesand involvement of the ceratohyoid and its articulation withthe stylohyoid are much more frequent than previously assumed (Walker et al . 2002; Maher et al . 2008; Hilton et al . 2009). Computed tomography is also more accurate for thedetection of fractures or concurrent middle ear disease (Hiltonet al . 2009; Palus et al . 2012). Hence, CT may allow the identification of abnormalities not seen endoscopically or withradiography and can contribute to finding the besttherapeutic course for individual horses. Furthermore, standingCT units are becoming increasingly available to the equinepatient, avoiding additional risks and costs of generalanaesthesia particularly in patients with the neurological formof the disease, with costs comparable with extensiveconventional radiographic studies. Magnetic resonance imaging of the equine head currently requires general anaesthesia, but has been used in selectedcases to diagnose THO or refine the diagnosis of involvedstructures (Walker et al . 2002). Observed abnormalities on MRI include fluid accumulation in the region of the proximalstylohyoid bone and wall of the guttural pouch, consistent withhaemorrhage or inflammation, structural changes of thecochlea and semicircular canals, and evidence of fracture ofthe stylohyoid or petrous temporal bone (Walker et al . 2002). Magnetic resonance imaging provides better images for theevaluation of soft tissues and may allow the identification andcharacterisation of damage involving the middle and innerear, peripheral nerves and the brain (Walker et al . 2002). Therefore MRI may improve our accuracy in prognosticatinghow current or impending neurological deficits will progress inpatients affected with THO. Diagnostic procedures requiringgeneral anaesthesia should be avoided if acute vestibularsigns are present, unless a planned surgical treatment can beperformed immediately after the imaging procedure underthe same anaesthetic. Nuclear scintigraphy is a sensitive detector of certain bone abnormalities, and increased radiopharmaceutical uptakemay precede detectable radiographic changes associatedwith THO. In a single case report, scintigraphy allowedconfirmation of a bilateral process that was suspectedclinically and radiographically (Frame et al . 2005). Finally, if general anaesthesia is performed for advanced imaging and/or surgery, tympanocentesis or cerebrospinalfluid collection via the cerebellomedullary cistern may . al . 2002; Divers et al . 2006). Although technically demanding, the potential benefitof tympanocentesis is that specific bacterial pathogens canbe identified and subsequent antimicrobial therapy adjustedaccordingly. These procedures may also provide additionalinformation regarding the aetiology of THO.Conservative treatment Treatment strategies for THO focus on decreasinginflammation and pain associated with ankylosis of the temporohyoid articulation and/or fractures involving the stylohyoid or petrous temporal bones (Blythe et al . . et al . 2004; Divers et al . 2006). Medical treatment includes steroidal and nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs in combination with broad spectrumantimicrobials or antimicrobials directed at bacterial infectionswith Staphylococcus species to address possible otitis media/interna and secondary infections associated withhaemorrhage around fracture sites (Walker et al . 2002; Divers et al . 2006; Readford et al . 2013). Concurrent administration of gabapentin in a case of THO with headshaking was reported to have significantly contributed to reducing headshaking by controlling neuropathic pain of the affected nerves (Readfordet al . 2013). In cases with exposure keratitis/corneal ulcerations or keratoconjunctivitis sicca due to facial nerve dysfunction,these should be managed using conventional ulcer treatmentincluding traditional temporary tarsorrhaphy, or ideally bymultifocal split-lid tarsorrhaphies as described by Divers et al . (2006). Furthermore, care should be taken to avoid self-trauma through ear rubbing, and iatrogenic manipulations such asnasogastric intubation or dental procedures. Either could elicitor exacerbate existing neurological signs (Readford et al . 2013). Surgical treatment Two surgical procedures have been developed consecutivelyto reduce the load on the temporohyoid articulation, with thegoal of decreasing pain and preventing fracture or refractureof the petrous-temporal bone (Blythe et al . 1994; Pease et al . 2004). Disease recurrence was seen in some horses after theoriginally described partial stylohoidectomy procedure due toosseous bridging of the stylohyoid resection gap (Pease et al . 2004). During partial stylohyoidectomy, the periosteum is notremoved to prevent disruption of the hypoglossal nerve andlingual vessels (Blythe et al . 1994), with the result that the remaining periosteum can act as a scaffold, facilitatingregrowth of the ostectomy site (Pease et al . 2004). Ceratohyoidectomy was initially performed in 2 THO cases where clinical signs had recurred within 6 months afterstylohyoidectomy (Pease et al . 2004), and a safer, easier and more permanent surgical procedure was sought.The ceratohyoidectomy procedure has now become thestandard surgical approach to address THO. The ceratohyoidbone is excised completely, and the cartilaginous ends of thestylohyoid and basihyoid bones remain, preventing bonyreunion. One-stage bilateral stylohyoidectomy been reported previously (Blythe et al . 1994; Pease et al . 2004). In a single reported case, dysphagia and problems with prehension andmastication developed immediately after surgery in a clinicallynormal horse (Blythe et al . 1994). Although much improved, residual deficits were still present 5 weeks after surgery, andbased on this experience, the authors recommendedperforming a 2-stage procedure with a minimum of 5 weeksbetween the ostectomies (Blythe et al . 1994). Based on this single case report, concerns about a single-stage bilateralprocedure are still found in standard equine surgery textbooks(Freeman and Hardy 2012). In the other case of bilateral \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd123 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014stylohyoidectomy reported in the literature, marked improvement of preoperative dysphagia was observed within48 h after the bilateral procedure (Pease et al . 2004). The case reported by Bras et al . (2014) contributes to the impression that a bilateral procedure (in this case a combined leftstylohyoidectomy and right ceratohyoidectomy) may providea safe and valid treatment option. It has been mentionedelsewhere that ceratohyoidectomy may be performed bilaterally and prophylactically on the contralateral side, but detailed information and case follow-up have not beenpublished (Hilton et al . 2009). Recently, it has been shown that unilateral ceratohyoidectomy can be performed safely in standing,sedated healthy horses (O'Brien et al . 2011). However, it is as yet unclear whether it is a safe procedure to perform in horseswith pre-existing THO. Auricular anaesthesia may permit adequate pain management in the conscious sedated horse, but tensile forces placed on the hyoid apparatus to excise theceratohyoid bone could elicit an acute neurological crisis,putting the health of the horse and surgeon at immediate risk. Prognosis The prognosis for return to athletic function for horsespresenting with clinical manifestations of THO is fair (Walkeret al . 2002). Retrospective analysis of 33 cases showed that 63% of the horses for which long-term follow-up was availableeventually returned to athletic use. It is to be noted that mosthorses had some residual cranial nerve deficits and it tooksome horses up to 2 years for maximal improvement.Furthermore, only 2 of the 33 horses in this report had asuccessful partial stylohyoid-resection performed. Reports onsurgical management of THO suggest that surgical proceduresaimed at reducing the stress on the temporohyoid joint aresuccessful in stopping and reversing the progression ofneurological signs of THO in most horses (Blythe et al . 1994; Pease et al . et al . 2008; Hilton et al . 2009). In a retrospective analysis of 24 surgically managed cases of THO,nearly 89% of horses treated by ceratohyoidectomy weresubstantially improved one year after surgery, with mostimprovement occurring within 6 months post operatively, butonly 50% of horses returning to athletic activity (Maher et al . 2008). Conclusion Although the precise aetiology and natural progression of THOis unknown, it is thought to be a slowly progressive diseaseentity (Hilton et al . 2009). The literature now provides increasing evidence that bilateral disease is common although clinicalmanifestations usually predominate on one side. Furthermore,it may be speculated that ceratohyoidectomy can be safelyperformed bilaterally and potentially even in the standingsedated patient. With this in mind, early and completeassessment of (bilateral) involvement becomes increasinglyimportant. Two questions regarding the appropriate treatment for THO exist: Which patients are best treated by medical managementalone, compared to combined medical and surgicaltreatment? Is prophylactic (bilateral) ceratohyoidectomyindicated in cases with non-neurological forms of THO or incases with bilateral involvement? Diagnostic anaesthesia of the auricular nerves, BAER testing, (standing) CT and nuclear scintigraphy examinationshave been identified as diagnostic procedures that may provide the clinician with the additional information to thatgained from clinical examination and guttural pouchendoscopy to answer to these 2 questions. These diagnostic procedures may offer valuable information both for the initial assessment as well as for follow-up examinations to monitordisease progression or changes associated with surgicalinterventions.

M. Beccar Varela*, L. A. Patipa and R. B. Eggleston Reid and Associates Equine Medicine and Surgery, Florida, USA; andDepartment of Large Animal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Georgia, evaluated for acute onset of a nonweightbearing lameness and swelling of the left hindlimb. Clinical and lameness evaluation and diagnostic intrasynovial anaesthesia lameness resulted immediate postoperative improvement in the lameness score. Rest andcontrolled exercise achieved complete resolution of thelameness with the filly being able to start training withoutapparent lameness. Subchondral cystic lesions of the proximalsesamoid bones can be a cause of nonweightbearinglameness. Surgical debridement resulted in completeresolution of the lameness with favourable in Subchondral bone cysts (SBCs) are well-documented types in horses. These cysts may be articular orextra-articular and may, or may not, in Baxter 1996; McIlwraith with aremost commonly found in the weightbearing surface of joints(Kawcak and Baxter 2011). Horses of all breeds are susceptibleto subchondral bone cystic lesions and, even though morecommonly reported in individuals aged <3 years, any age can be affected (Kawcak and Baxter 2011). Osteochondrosis is the most common cause of SBCs in young horses. The aetiology is multifactorial, includinggenetics (Hoppe and Phillipson 1985), dietary management(Glade and Belling 1986) and growth rate (Savage et al . 1993) among others. In the older horse, trauma leading to injury tothe articular cartilage and subchondral bone is lesions al . 1996). Subchondral bone cysts show marked variation in size and shape; they may beshallow or deep ( >10 mm) and may be domed, conical or spherical in shape (Sherlock and Mair 2011). Grossly, thesecysts have a fibrous lining and contain fibrous tissue, with orwithout synovial gelatinous material. Some SBCs also and occasionally contain necrotic bone (VonRechenberg et al . 2000). Molecular studies have revealed thatthe fibrous tissue within the cyst produces inflammatory mediators and metalloproteinases that induce boneresorption (Von Rechenberg et al . 2000). Subchondral bone cysts can affect nearly every appendicular joint in horses (Textor et al . 2001). The medial femoral condyle is the most commonly area (Baxter 1996; McIlwraith 1998; Goodrich and McIlwraith 2008; Hendrix et al . 2010). Other described SBC locations include the distal metacarpal or metatarsal bone (Hogan et al . 1997), the glenoid cavity (Bertone et al . 1986; Kay 2006), the humerus (Arnold et al . 2008; Little et al . 2009) the proximal aspect of the tibia (Textor et al . 2001), the talus (Montgomery and Juzwiak 2009) and the phalanges (Story and Bramlage 2004; Smith et al . 2005a; Sherlock and Mair 2011). Multiple therapeutic options have been described for the treatment of SBCs. Conservative management as well assurgical intervention has been described. Conservativemanagement includes stall rest, intra-articular medications(hyaluronan, corticosteroids) and systemic nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory medications (Baxter 1996). Surgicalintervention is indicated when conservative management hasfailed. Historically, surgical intervention for SBC lesions includedarthrotomy or arthroscopic surgical debridement with orwithout the use of different types of grafts (chondrocytes,bone marrow, cancellous bone, platelet rich plasma geletc.) . 1988; Howard et al . 1995; Fortier and Nixon 2005). A more recently described approach to treat theselesions involves intralesional corticosteroids Boone and Peroni 2009; Montgomery and Juzwiak 2009) in order to reduce theproduction of inflammatory mediators within the cyst. To our knowledge subchondral bone cysts of the proximal sesamoid bone (PSB) have not been reported in the literature.Here we report the occurrence of a SBC of the apical portionof the proximal sesamoid bone in a 20-month-old Warmblood filly. Case details Relevant history A 337 kg 16-month-old Warmblood filly presented to the University of Georgia Large Animal Teaching Hospitalfor evaluation of acute onset of lameness of the right hindlimb.At that time radiographic evaluation revealed osteochondritisdissecans lesions of the lateral trochlear ridge of the femur inboth stifles as well as osteochondral lesion of distal126 \u00a9 2012 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014intermediate ridge of the right tibia. Arthroscopic surgery was performed on both femoropatellar joints and the right tarsocrural joint for removal of the osteochondral fragments and debridement of the subchondral bone. The filly made a full recovery based on follow-up communication with the owner. Four months following the initial surgery the filly (418 kg) re-presented as an emergency for evaluation of an acute nonweightbearing ( grade 5/5 ) lameness (Anon 1991) of the left hindlimb. The owner noted the onset of lameness one week prior to presentation. There was no known history of trauma to the affected limb. Clinical findings On initial examination the filly exhibited a grade 5/5 left hind lameness (Anon 1991). Palpation of the limb revealed moderate oedema of the distal limb extending from the mid-metatarsus to the pastern. Marked effusion was palpated within the left metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint and digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS). Palpation of the lateral branch of the suspensory ligament (SL) and lateral PSB elicited a severe pain response. On physical examination thefilly was tachycardic (heart rate 56 beats/min), and mildly febrile (rectal temperature, 38.6\u00b0C). Due to the severity of the lameness, no additional lameness work-up was performed. Ultrasonographic examination of the distal limb revealed significant oedemasurrounding the MTP joint and distal metatarsus, which was more marked on the lateral aspect of the limb particularly around the lateral branch of the suspensory ligament. Evaluation of the medial and lateral SL branches revealed anincreased cross-sectional area of the lateral branch at itsinsertion on the abaxial border of the PSB ( Fig 1 ). Marked anechoic effusion was noted within the DFTS and the MTP joint. There was a step defect seen over the lateral PSB, whichwas consistent with an area of irregular bone at the insertion of the lateral branch of the SL ( Fig 2 ).Radiographic evaluation of the MTP joint showed significant soft tissue swelling surrounding the joint and distal metatarsus, with changes being more severe laterally. Awell-defined 1 cm in diameter radiolucent defect was presentat the apex of the lateral PSB ( Figs 3 and 4). Ill-defined sclerosis surrounded the lesion. Based on the filly's history of multiple joint osteochondrosis and the current radiographic findings, radiographic evaluationof the remaining metacarpo/metatarsophalangeal joints was performed. In the left metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint a small, 2 \u00a53 mm mineral density was identified dorsal to the metacarpal proximal sagittal ridge; associated with the concave lucent defect in the proximal sagittal ridge. In the right MTP joint the metatarsal proximal sagittal ridge was irregularly marginated. Arthrocentesis of the left MTP joint, using a dorsolateral approach, yielded hazy yellow synovial fluid with a nucleated cell count of 2.8 \u00a510 9/l (normal 50-500 \u00a5106/l) and a protein concentration of g/l (normal <25 g/l). Cytology revealed a moderate number of predominant type was mononuclear cells, 35-40% nondegenerate neutrophils, with few red blood cells, and a small number of lymphocytes. No infectious agents were seen. After fluidsampling, 12 ml of 2% mepivacaine hydrochloride (Carbocaine-V) 1was injected into the joint. Moderate improvement in lameness was noted after the intra-articular block. Injection of the DFTS through a proximolateral approach, with 12 ml of 2% mepivacaine hydrochloride, resulted in marked improvement in lameness after 15 min.Attempts to sample the DFTS were unsuccessful, however. Treatment Arthroscopy of the left and right MTP joints and the left MCP joint was recommended to the owners based on radiographic findings. A complete blood count was performed prior to surgery with no abnormalities detected. Fig 1: Transverse ultrasonographic view of the lateral and medial branches of the suspensory ligament. Note the increased cross sectional area of the lateral branch at its insertion on the abaxial border of the proximal sesamoid 2012 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014The filly was given potassium i.v.) and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen on a large animal circleanaesthesia machine (Tafonius) 9. The filly was placed in right lateral recumbency and both MTP joints and the left MCP jointareas were clipped and aseptically prepared with 5%chlorhexidine with a sterile water rinse. After routine double draping, the left hind fetlock joint was distended with 35 ml ofsterile polyionic fluids. An arthroscope portal incision wascreated routinely in the most proximal aspect of theplantar-lateral pouch of the left MTP joint. Exploration of the joint revealed extensive synovial proliferation and a small areaof discoloured but intact cartilage over the apex of the lateralPSB. An instrument portal was created 3-4 cm distal to the scope portal at the lateral aspect of the joint. An endoscopicmotorised synovial resector 10was used for motorised bur10the PSB the subchondralbone cyst. Upon entering the cyst, a plume of debris exited thecavity of the cyst. The cyst lining was bone curette and Ferris-Smith rongeurs. Intraoperative radiographs used to debridement the cyst ( Fig 5 ). After thoroughly lavaging the joint with sterile polyionic fluids, morphine (0.05 mg/kg bwt) was injected into the joint and theincisions were closed routinely. The right MTP and the left MCPjoints were explored and the respective proximal sagittal ridgelesions were debrided arthroscopically through a et al . 2005). Thefilly recovered from anaesthesia uneventfully and walked back to the stall with no apparent lameness. Post operative radiographs were not obtained. Outcome Antimicrobial therapy was continued for 24 h andphenylbutazone was continued at a tapering dose for the following 5 days. During the immediate post operative periodand 3 days after the surgery no lameness was noted at a walk.The filly was discharged with no apparent lameness 3 daysafter the surgery. At a 24 month telephone follow-up, the referring veterinarian, reported that the filly was being ridden (walk, trot,canter) 4 times a week and had entered a dressage trainingprogramme, without lameness on the left hindlimb. The filly wasalso reported to have a negative MTP joint flexion test. Discussion In this report we describe a SBC of the apical region of the lateral proximal sesamoid bone that was treated successfully by arthroscopic surgical debridement. To the authors' knowledge, cystic lesions in the apical portionof the PSB have not been reported before. This horse's clinicalpresentation and diagnostic findings supported the diagnosis of the SBC as the likely cause of the lameness. The filly's previous history supports osteochondrosis as the likely aetiology of the SBC. During the first hospitalisation episode only the affected joints and the contralateral limb were radiographed. Based on the presence of lesions in multiple sites, some clinicians might have chosen to radiograph theMCP and MTP joints. In this case, during the first visit we did notfind any compelling reason to obtain these radiographs. Of interest in this particular case was the severe nature of the lameness. More common diseases that affect the PSBs and Fig 2: Longitudinal ultrasonographic view of the insertion of the lateral and medial branches of the suspensory ligament. Note the area of irregular bone at the apex of the lateral proximal sesamoid bone (arrow) at the insertion of the branch of the suspensory ligament. \u00a9 2012 EVJ Ltd128 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION 2014cause lameness include fractures, sesamoiditis and of the 2001; and Bramlage Bertone 2011). Due to the oedema of the distal limb, the acute onset and severity of the lameness, sepsis was a differential diagnosiswhen the filly presented; thus the arthrocentesis of the MTP jointand the attempt to obtain synovial fluid from the DFTS. Sepsis ofthe MTP joint was ruled out but the involvement of the DFTScould not be ruled out with sampling. The progression of thelameness following surgery confirmed that sepsis was unlikelyto be the cause of the lameness. The acute onset and degree of lameness in the horse in this report was more severe than what is more commonlydescribed with cysts reported in other locations (Bramlage1993; Textor et al . 2001; Smith et al . 2005b; Kay 2006). The majority of the SBCs reported are located on theweightbearing region of the articular surface (Bramlage 1993;Kawcak and Baxter 2011) undergoing compressive forces. Theproximal sesamoid bones, however, are known to be underhigh tensile forces (Bertone 2011), which might havecontributed in this case to the severity of the lameness.Another explanation for the severity and acuteness of thelameness could have been trauma to the affected limb. Thiscould also explain the degree of oedema seen in the limb.Although unlikely due to the history, this cannot be discounted.During arthroscopic surgery, no visual communication with the joint was seen; this might have accounted for the weakresponse to intra-articular analgesia of the MTP joint. Thelameness, however, improved substantially when intra-articular(MTP joint) and intrathecal (DFTS) anaesthesia were performedin combination. This blocking pattern was seen in cases ofosteitis of the axial border of the sesamoid bone (Dabareineret al . 2001). Unfortunately intrathecal (DFTS) anaesthesia by itself was not performed in this case because of theprogression of diagnostics, although it is fair to assume that theresponse might have been similar to the MTP joint block, and itwas the combination that resulted in a marked improvementin the lameness. The irregular surface of the apical portion of the PSB noticed on ultrasound and the enlargement of thecross-sectional area of the lateral branch of the SL can beattributed to the local inflammation and bone pathology.These are comparable to ultrasonographic changes seen incases of inflammation at the insertion of the intersesamoideanligament (Dabareiner et al . 2001). It is unlikely that the SBC was secondary to insertional desmopathy of the SL because,despite the enlargement of the cross-sectional area, the fibrepattern and echogenicity of the ligament were not altered asseen with other ligament desmopathies (Dakin et al . 2009). Arthroscopic debridement of the SBC in this case resulted in an immediate improvement post operatively, resulting insoundness at a walk. This was attributed to the excessive Fig 3: Dorsolateral-plantaromedial oblique radiographic projection of the left hind fetlock joint. Note the significant soft tissue swellingsurrounding the fetlock joint and distal metatarsus. A well-definedcircular radiolucent is at the apex of the lateralproximal sesamoid bone. Ill-defined sclerosis surrounds the lesion. Fig 4: Dorsoplantar radiographic projection of the left hindfetlock. A well-defined circular radiolucent defect is present atthe apex of the lateral proximal sesamoid bone. Note the swelling / MARCH 2014pressure released from the cyst. Short- and long-term follow-up indicated complete recovery of the filly with no signs oflameness. In this case we elected to perform arthroscopy ofthe MTP joint to evaluate further the joint for any otherpathology based on the severity of the lameness. Intralesionalinjection of steroids (Foerner et al . 2006; Wallis et al . 2008) might have been a viable alternative if sepsis was not suspected;furthermore, it is fair to assume that the latter treatmentwould have lacked the immediate positive response seenafter debridement and decompression of the cyst.Macroscopically, the debrided material from the SBC in thiscase included pale necrotic bone, although this cannot beconfirmed without histopathological evaluation, which wasnot performed. Small circular radiographic lucencies seen as incidental radiographic findings in Thoroughbred yearlings seem to haveno effect in the number of starts in this population of horses(Kane 2000). The radiographic abnormality in the casereported here was larger and located apically in the PSB. Thedegree of lameness in this case was a major difference as well. In Thoroughbred racehorses, performance after removal of apical sesamoid fracture fragments carried an excellentprognosis for racing in horses with hindlimb fractures (Schnabelet al . 2006, 2007). Debridement of the cyst and apex of the sesamoid bone in this case could be compared to theremoval of an apical sesamoid fracture. Overall, the prognosisfor return to performance for horses with SBCs ranges from 30to 90%, depending on the breed, age and intended use of thehorse and the bone and joints affected, as well as thetreatment performed (McIlwraith 1990, 1998; Bramlage Wallis et al . 2008; Kawcak and Baxter 2011). Based on these studies, there is evidence to indicate that the sesamoid bone healswell after debridement of apical fractures; this gives reason toexpect SBCs of the apical portion of the sesamoid bonesshould have a fairly good prognosis following surgical debridement.

AHD first recorded subchondral cyst-like lesion proximalsesamoid bone T. Greet Suffolk, UK. author email: tim.greet@rossdales.com Subchondral bone cysts have been recognised in horses for almost half a century (Pettersson and Sevelius 1968). Some cyst-like structures are occasionally found as well-recognised sequelae of osteoarthritis in mature horses. However, in younganimals they were originally thought to represent a form of osteochondrosis, localised to the weightbearing portion of a joint (Stromberg 1979). Since then, alternative mechanisms fortheir causation have been suggested, including repeatedmicrotrauma to the subchondral bone, or the entry of synovialfluid through a small defect of the articular cartilage into thesubchondral bone (Kold et al . 1986; Kold 1989). It has been suggested that such insults result in the formation of a cyst-likestructure (Norman 1984) with a fibrous lining that has beenshown to contain cytokines and metalloproteinases, whichcause bone resorption (von Rechenberg et al . 2000). Most of these cysts occur in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle are the most common locations. However,similar cysts have been identified associated with most joints ofthe appendicular skeleton including proximal and distalinterphalangeal joints, elbow, shoulder and the tarsocruraljoint. Whilst such cysts can be incidental findings in some jointsof sound horses, particularly the carpus (Ellis 1985), they areusually the cause of lameness of variable severity. Treatmentsused successfully include conservative management, cystenucleation, packing with a cancellous bone graft andinjection of corticosteroids or other joint modifying drugsdirectly into the cyst (Wallis et al . 2008; Boone and Peroni 2009). In this issue of the EVE, Beccar Varela et al . (2014) give the first report of a cyst-like structure in the apical portionof a proximal sesamoid bone, successfully treated byenucleation under endoscopic control. The reportedfeatures of this case are not typical of cysts at other sites; thecyst was not in the weightbearing portion of the joint and theyearling showed moderate oedema of the limb from midmetatarsus to pastern, as well as marked effusion of themetatarsophalangeal joint and digital sheath. Whilst a mildlyelevated leucocyte count in the joint was not inconsistent witha typical cyst, similar findings have been encountered insubchondral infection of a proximal sesamoid bone ( Fig 1 ) which did not appear to have direct continuity with either thejoint or tendon sheath (T. Greet, unpublished observation). Thelameness was very severe (5/5) in the yearling in the currentreport, which can occur with some subchondral cysts as cavities caused sesamoid bones is well recognised in horsesassociated with penetrating injury as well as those in whichinfection has an apparently haematogenous route. The axialborder of the sesamoid bones is a common location for thehaematogenous type of infection and typically there is biaxialinvolvement; of 7 affected horses in one report, 3 hadconcurrent septic digital tenosynovitis, 2 had sepsis of the fetlock joint and 2 had normal synovial fluid in the affectedfetlock (Wisner et al . 1991). One factor, which perhaps encouraged a diagnosis of a bone cyst rather than infection in the yearling in thecurrent report, was that the horse had already undergoneendoscopic surgery for osteochondrosis in both stifles andthe right tarsocrural joint and at the time of cyst enucleationwas also treated for osteochondral lesions of the dorsalsagittal ridge of the left metacarpophalangeal and rightmetatarsophalangeal joints. During surgery via the plantar pouch of the fetlock joint, the lateral proximal sesamoid bone had intact butdiscoloured cartilage over the affected area, when viewedendoscopically, but cyst entry proved easy and the wholearea was debrided using a motorised burr, more or lessremoving the apical third of the bone. The filly was immediately more comfortable after surgery, which would not be typical of many cases in which cysts are Fig 1: An oblique radiographic view of lateral proximal sesamoid bone, of a 15-year-old Thoroughbred gelding with osteomyelitis,following a penetrating wound. Synoviocentesis of digital sheathand metatarsophalangeal joint showed no evidence of synovialsepsis.132 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014enucleated, but much more commonly seen following treatment of synovial sepsis. In fact, horses in which bone cystsare enucleated are often significantly more lame for a fewdays after surgery (T. Greet, unpublished observation).Antibiotics were administered for only 24 h and the filly wassaid to be sound after 3 days. By contrast, horses withosteomyelitis of a proximal sesamoid bone especially thosewith biaxial haematogenous infections, almost always have avery guarded or hopeless prognosis, even after attemptedsurgical debridement ( Fig 2 ) or prolonged treatment with antibiotic medication. All of the 7 horses reported in one study(Wisner et al . 1991) were subjected to euthanasia because of intractable infection. Therefore the rapid improvement andsoundness of this horse is much more consistent with a typicalsubchondral cyst-like structure.Ultimately the case reported by Beccar Varela et al . (2012) merits attention not only as the first genuine subchondral cyst of a proximal sesamoid bone to be described, but alsobecause of the rapid and apparently complete resolution of clinical signs following its surgical ablation.

This complication is frequentlydescribed in neurosurgical procedures, caesarean sectionand orthopaedic (Nicholson 1982). In recentyears VAE has not been reported as a result of urinary tractendoscopy in human medicine because the use of fluids forirrigation in modern endoscopy has become standardpractice (Nicholson 1982; Schultheiss et al . 1999). In small animals, there are only a few reports in the literature of air embolism secondary to pneumourethrographyand pneumocystography related to the presence of lesions atthe urethral or bladder level and macroscopic haematuria(Ackerman et al . 1972; Thayer et al . 1980). In recent years, diagnostic procedures for the urinary tract have also beenperformed with contrast-enhanced CT which is considered tobe the primary imaging technique for avoiding the risk of VAE(Schultheiss et al . 1999). The techniques described in equine medicine have used either air or carbon dioxide insufflation to improve thevisualisation of the urinary tract (Bertone 1998; Menzies-Gow2007). In horses, flexible cystoscopy is used in both sexes. Airinflation flexible endoscopy is a valid aid in the equinediagnostic procedure for visualising the urethra, the bladderand the ureteral openings in the trigone, and for evaluatingthe presence of uroliths, inflammation, anomalies andneoplasia. In equine patients, cases of VAE have been described after dislodgement of the jugular venous catheter capswith the subsequent entry of air into the jugular vein (Bradburyet al . 2005; Holbrok et al . 2007). To our knowledge, no data have been reported during endoscopy procedures inhorses.The aim of this case report is to describe a case of suspected VAE during a cystoscopy in a Warmblood Argentinian horse in a standing position. Case description A 10-year-old Warmblood Argentinian gelding was admittedto the University of Bologna Veterinary Teaching Hospital(UBVTH) with a 9-month history of intermittent urethral drippingof purulent fluid not associated with urination. Before referral to the UBVTH, the horse had been treated on 3 occasions within the previous 9 months withphenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg bwt i.m.) once dailyfor 10 consecutive days, each time. At clinical evaluation the horse appeared bright and alert, with normal rectal temperature (38.1\u00b0C, 100.6\u00b0F), and heart (32beats/min) and respiratory (12 breaths/min) rates. Only a plugof whitish yellow material around the preputial ostium and thetip of the penis was observed. A complete blood count (CBC), and biochemical and urinary evaluations were carried out. neutrophils were detected on The profile revealed a activity, (6.8 mmol/l; rr 9.8-46.5), phosphorus (0.35 mmol/l; rr 0.56-1.58) and total calcium (2.72 mmo/l; rr 2.82-3.25)concentrations. The urinalysis carried out on the voided urine revealed the following: pH 8, leucocytes >50 WBC/HPF, and calcium carbonate crystals >50 crystals/LPF. Ultrasound evaluation, carried out by means of a trans-rectal examination using a7.5 MHz linear probe, revealed a uniformly echogenicthickening (15 mm) of the wall of the partially empty bladder;the contents of the bladder appeared hyperechoic andinhomogeneous. The urethral lumen appeared distended andcontained the same echogenic material as present in thebladder. The ampullae of the deferent ducts, vesicular glands and bulbo-urethral glands appeared bilaterally enlarged withpathologically large amounts of hypoechogenic liquidmaterial ( Fig 1 ). Evaluation of the right and left kidneys carried out with a 3.5 MHz convex probe revealed normal findings. A flexible endoscopic examination of the urethra and bladder, with the patient sedated and in a standing position,was performed 3 days after UBVTH admission. The clinical evaluation carried out by the anaesthetist before the sedation revealed no abnormalities: heart rate 32134 \u00a9 2013 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE 2014beats/min and respiratory rate 12 breaths/min. Noninvasive arterial pressure measured using the oscillometric methodwith the cuff placed on the tail was 135 mm Hg, 85 mm Hgand 101 mm Hg for the systolic, diastolic and mean The of sedation with mild ataxia was maintained with a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of detomidine(0.01 mg/kg bwt/h i.v.) 2was administered with a catheter (14 gauge) placed in the left jugular vein. A stallion urinary catheter (23 Fr, 150 cm) was inserted to remove the urine and to improve visualisation of the bladderwall during the endoscopy. After the removal of the catheter,the flexible videoendoscope probe, having a diameter of6 mm and length of 120 cm (EPM-300p, Pentax) 3, was introduced into the urethra and an intermittent inflation of airwith a maximal pressure of 20 mmHg was used in order todistend the urethra and the bladder. The entire urethral wall appeared significantly hyperaemic, with multiple strictures especially in the area close to theproximal urethral sphincter. The openings of the urethral glandson the lateral aspect of the pelvic urethra were visibleendoscopically and purulent material leaked out from theostia of the glands. After examination of the urethra, theendoscope was passed through the urethral sphincter intothe bladder which was distended with a larger volume of air.Initially, no apparent degree of discomfort was caused to theanimal and the bladder wall appeared heavily hyperaemicwith a marked increase of the sub-mucosal vasculature. Theureteral openings were visualised by retroflection of theendoscope at the 10 and the 2 o'clock positions on the dorsalaspect of the bladder trigone. Normal-looking urine drainedintermittently from these openings.Thirty minutes after the start of the procedure, the horse showed increased sweating and muscular twitching, andbecame more ataxic as compared to the beginning of the endoscopic examination. Soon after the commencement of these signs, the horse fell to the ground with generalisedmuscular twitching and horizontal nystagmus. The pulse was difficult to perceive with an arrhythmic pulse rate of 52 beats/min; tachypnoea (60 breaths/min) was also detected.Arterial blood gas-analysis taken approximately 10 min afterthe appearance of the ataxia and nystagmus, and before thegeneral anaesthesia revealed an increased pH (7.52; rr7.35-7.47), decreased partial pressure of CO 2(PaCO 2) (32 mmHg; rr 36-46), decreased partial pressure of O 2(PaO 2) (55 mmHg; rr 80-100) and decreased saturation of oxygen (SO 2) (91%; rr 93-100). General anaesthesia was induced with a was immediately taken to the recovery room using a surgery table, administered oxygen (100% at 10 l/min through the bwt twitching ceased after the horse wasanaesthetised with thiopental but the horizontal nystagmuscontinued for approximately 10 min after the medetomidinewas administered. An electrocardiogram (3 leads, base apex) was then connected to the patient showing evidence of sinustachycardia with premature ventricular complexes; narrowQRS complexes with right axis deviation, indicating anincomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), were observed.In particular, evidence of Q waves in lead I with deep S waveswere detected; ST elevation and inverted polarity of the Twave were observed in lead III. It was considered that theseECG alterations might have been secondary to acutemyocardial damage and transient ventricular ischaemiaproducing conduction delay in the right bundle branch anddispersion of the repolarisation into the ventricle withconsequent ST elevation. In the recovery stall, a venous blood sample was withdrawn in order to perform CBC, and a biochemical andcoagulation profile including D-dimers, antithrombin and fibrinogen. The results were unremarkable. Twenty minutes after the induction of the general anaesthesia, the horse stood up without difficulty; it appearedataxic for 20 min. Two hours later, the horse appeared normalat general examination and was returned to the stable. Anultrasound examination performed 24 h after the episode ofcollapse revealed the presence of reverberating echoes fromgas in the ureters and in the renal pelvis of both kidneys. Thehorse was treated for 5 days with unfractionated heparin(Clarisco, 100 ui/kg bwt q. 24 h, i.v.) 7after the initial VAE clinical signs. The patient was discharged 7 days later with a diagnosis of chronic infection of the bulbourethral glands and was treatedwith a combination of sulfadiazine/trimetroprim (Gelliprim) 5 (5 ml/60 kg bwt per os ) for 60 days. Discussion Venous air embolism represents the passage of air or medical gases into the venous system and has been describedin human medicine as a complication of endoscopicprocedures (Nicholson 1982). Fig 1: Ultrasound image of the right bulbo-urethral gland which appeared distended with pathologic diffuse hypoechogenic liquidmaterial. The image was obtained with a 7.5 MHz probeusing a trans-rectal approach. \u00a9 2013 VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014The factors determining the morbidity and mortality of any episode of VAE include air entrainment rate and volume. Therisk factors of VAE as described in the literature regardinghumans include: the operative site placed more than 5 cmabove the right atrium; numerous larger, non-compressedvenous channels in the surgical field; the creation of a pressuregradient which permits air entry into the circulation, andbarotrauma or trauma to the chest which cause alveolar rupture (Shaikh and Ummunisa 2009). In small animals, data regarding the risk factors of VAE during surgical procedures or endourology are limited andreferred to a very old single case (Thayer et al . 1980). Distension of the urinary structures and the presence ofhaematuria during urinary tract disease seems to be involved(Thayer et al . 1980). With the aid of a flexible endoscopic probe, air was pumped into the urethra of the horse with a maximal pressure of 20 mm Hg for about 10 min. In dogs, the lethal volume of airwhen injected rapidly i.v. (5 s or less) is 7.5 ml/kg bwt while, inrabbits, the dose al . 1953; Toung et al . 2001). No data have been reported for horses or other large animals. The observed reverberating echoes from gas in the ureters and in the renal pelvis of both kidneys could be correlated tothe large volume of air used during cystoscopy as previouslydescribed during a radiological examination of a cat with afatal air embolism due to pneumocystography (Thayer et al . 1980). It is not known if this finding can occur without VAE, butin the experience of the authors it does not; the authors havenot previously observed air in the ureters and in the renal pelvisduring equine ultrasonographic evaluation performed aftercystoscopy. The main systems affected in the course of VAEare the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems(Shaikh and Ummunisa 2009). The different clinicalmanifestations vary with the quantity of air entering thecirculation (Mirski et al . 2007). In the present case, different clinical signs were detected: tachycardia, tachypnoea and central nervous manifestationswith generalised muscular twitching, nystagmus and loss ofconsciousness. As described in human medicine (Mirski et al . 2007), the most reported cardiac alterations are chest pain associatedwith tachyarrhythmia which could be related to myocardialischaemia and increased filling pressure due to right-sidedheart failure. We hypothesised that the horse may have collapsed secondary to reduced cardiac output due to outputobstruction, right ventricular failure or myocardial ischaemia(incomplete RBBB) which rapidly resulted in cerebralhypoperfusion. Another possibility could be the developmentof cerebral ischaemia secondary to a direct cerebral arterialair embolism which could have produced the loss ofconsciousness. The best diagnostic procedures which couldhave been performed by the authors at the time ofthe episode in order to definitively diagnose VAE wereechocardiographic evaluation to see the bubble or a CT scan. End tidal CO 2(PE'CO 2) monitoring is a convenient and practical method used in the operating room (Mirski et al . 2007; Shaikh and Ummunisa 2009); however, in the presentcase which involved a standing endoscopy, it was not used ascapnography is not usually performed in standing procedures.Arterial blood gas analysis performed immediately after thecollapse showed a PaCO 2of 32 mmHg (rr 36-46 mmHg) andan increased pH. It is highly probable that this respiratory alkalosis (due to the increased respiratory rate) was secondary to the hypoxaemia. PaO 2was 55 mmHg (rr 80-100), SaO 2was reduced and clinical evaluation of the oral mucosa revealed a greyishpale-pink colour. In this horse these findings were consideredsigns of acute hypoxaemia or pulmonary oedema, asreported in human patients (Shaikh and Ummunisa 2009). The goal of the treatment for VAE was to prevent further air entry, reduce the volume of air already entered andgive haemodynamic support. Increasing the patient's oxygenation contributes to a reduction of the embolus volume by eliminating nitrogen (Shaikh and Ummunisa 2009).Maintenance of the systemic arterial pressure and centralvenous pressure with optimal fluid administration and inotropicsupport helps to keep the patient stable. An increasedincidence of VAE has been reported in human patients withlow central venous pressure which enhances the negativepressure gradient at the wound site compared to the right atrium (Mirski et al . 2007). In this case report, the horse was sedated with detomidine and butorphanol, and the sedationwas maintained with a CRI of detomidine; the a 2-agonist and butorphanol are associated with cardiopulmonary depressionwhich could have predisposed the horse to the VAE (Englandand Clarke 1996). The general anaesthesia was useful tominimise the neurological signs and to move the horse in therecovery box. The induction with thiopental was performed toreduce the risk of trauma and to avoid increasing theintracranial pressure in the patient. Despite the risk of severehypotension the induction of general anaesthesia appearedto be the best option for the horse. The prevention of VAE isbased principally on the use of saline solution as a medium fordistending the urethra and the bladder, preoxygenation with100% oxygen, and anticoagulant therapy while the use ofpositive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) added to intermittentpositive pressure ventilation (IPPV) remains controversial (Ryuet al . 1996; Palmon et al . 1997). The air and even carbon dioxide proved in human medicine to be an unphysiologicalmedium for distending the bladder and it irritates the mucosaand could be painful for the patient (Schultheiss et al . 1999). However, in the experience of the authors, the fluid pressure isoften insufficient to distend a pathologic bladder in horse. Anticoagulant therapy with unfractionated heparin when administered before or immediately after the VAE episodetends to decrease the severity of the symptoms, as describedin animal models (Ryu et al . 1996; Muth and Shank 2000). The exact mechanism Heparin can modulate manydifferent thrombo-inflammatory could decrease local fibrinformation and the endothelial expression of the platelet-activating factor and P-selectin, thereby decreasingleucocyte adherence at sites of an endothelium injured by thebubble during VAE. Conclusion In the present case, the sudden collapse of an adult horse withrespiratory, cardiovascular and neurological signs is describedduring lower urinary tract standing endoscopy under sedation.We believe that this is the first description of vascular airembolism under such circumstances in horses. The key to themanagement of VAE, however, remains prevention. \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd136 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014Authors' declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared.

Frank and P . JohnsonClinical Commentary Venous air embolism during cystoscopy in standing horses R. Nolen-Walston New Bolton Center, University of Pennsylvania, Kennett Square, USA. Corresponding author email: has been described in several case reports in the mature horse, but in each case, the embolusingress was presumed to be through a venous catheter (Bradbury et al . 2005; Holbrook et al . 2007; Pellegrini-Masini et al . 2009). The case report by Romagnoli et al . (2014) describes the first suspected incidence of this complication inassociation with cystoscopy. Cystoscopy of the urinarybladder was first described in man in 1806, but the firstaerocystoscopist was Diedrich Rutenberg, who, in 1876,described the use of an open speculum that used mirrors tovisualise the extent of the bladder lumen (Parazajder et al . 1977). However, by the turn of the century, air insufflation had fallen out of favour in human medicine due largely topreferences regarding clear visualisation using infused sterilefluids. There have been no published reports of air embolismfollowing air cystoscopy in man. This may be a function ofhow rarely it is used, rather than the intrinsic safety of theprocedure, although VAE has been reported as acomplication of medical Virtual cystoscopy (thin section helical computedtomography), uses intraluminal air as the contrast source(Hussain et al . 1997), but also has not, to date, been the subject of any published reports on VAE. In the horse, the thickmucus and dense calcium carbonate crystals thatcharacterise normal equine urine preclude the use of either urine itself or an exogenous fluid to distend the bladder during cystoscopic examination, as visibility would be close to nilwithout arduous and extensive flushing. As a result, equineveterinarians typically drain the urine by catheterisation priorto cystoscopy and use air to inflate the bladder, as shown inmultiple published photographs (Divers and Schott 2009). In man, air embolism is most commonly reported during neurosurgical procedures when the patient is placed in asitting position, with an incidence of 10-80% (Wong and Irwin2005). However, there are also many reports of VAE in vascularprocedures where a pressure differential between the venouscirculation and atmospheric pressure is encountered, suchas central venous catheter insertion and removal orhaemodialysis, and in circumstances where the pulmonaryparenchyma is penetrated including blunt force andpenetrating trauma to the thorax, high-pressure mechanicalventilation, and thoracocentesis (Palmon et al . 1997). VAE occurs when air is pressurised in a bodycavity, including arthroscopy (Pandey et al . 2013), laparoscopy (Kjeld et al . 2012), and intestinal, gastric and rectal endoscopy (Ha et al . 2009; Chen et al Baban et al 2013). Noniatrogenic air embolism seen during rapid decompression after scuba diving ('the bends'), and after oralingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide (Palmon et al . 1997). Nonetheless, despite the paucity of cases of VAE in human cystoscopy, fatal air embolism originating in the genitourinary tract is extensively described in man, although the organ of airentrainment is typically the uterus rather than the urinarybladder. The vast majority of such published cases describeVAE in the puerperium, after separation of the haemochorialplacenta, when the uterine lining is disrupted and has largeexposed vessels. These sudden deaths associated with airembolism are typically caused by sexual intercourse occurring within the weeks after parturition, presumably from air under pressure entering the venous circulation of the denudedmyometrium (Truhlar et al . 2007; Lyness and Bentley 2010). Additionally, deaths from VAE have also been reported innongravid, non- post partum women in association with vaginal air orogenital or autoerotic activities(Marc et et . 2007). The pathogenesis of this form of VAE may more closely resemble that seen in horsesfollowing cystoscopy where air enters the venous circulationthrough an intact or only mildly inflamed/abraded mucosalsurface, several examples of which have been reportedanecdotally amongst practitioners in recent years (R.Nolen-Walston 2013, unpublished data). In support of thistheory, sexual rear entry position during intercourse seems toincrease the danger of air embolism, where it has beendescribed that 'pelvic elevation with the uterus raised abovethe right ventricle produces a pressure gradient favouring air passage to the heart.'(Truhlar et al . 2007). This is similar to the relation of the bladder and ventricle in the standing horseundergoing cystoscopy, but not similar to humans undergoingcystoscopy, where the patient is usually lying supine and theright ventricle is above the bladder ( Fig 1 ). Rate, volume and route of air entrainment all contribute to the severity of effects. In animals, volumes of 0.5-15 ml/kgbwt at rates of 100 ml/s are generally considered necessaryto create cardiac arrest or shock, although the closer the veinof entrainment is to the right heart, the less air is thought to beneeded (Mirski et al . 2007). In horses, this rate of airflow is achievable through a standard 14 gauge catheter atpressures gradients of 5 cmH Pellegrini-Masini et al . 2009), and furthermore is generally delivered through the jugular almost directly to the rightatrium. Central venous pressures at or below -5 cmH 2O have been recorded in hypohydrated horses (Nolen-Walston et al . 2011), thus making this eventuality quite plausible inhypovolaemic cases that suffer a venous line disruptionduring treatment, as well as during the huge shifts inintrathoracic (and thus central venous) pressure duringuncoordinated attempts to stand while recovering fromgeneral anaesthesia.138 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014Signs of air embolism in horses are similar to those seen in man, and include cardiovascular collapse and dysrhythmia, pulmonary oedema, and signs of central nervous system injury including blindness, seizures and behavioural abnormalities(Pellegrini-Masini et al . 2009). Air lock within the right ventricle has been observed to cause sudden death, but generally thesigns and symptoms are peracute. Arrhythmias changes, and ischaemia as the right heart pressures rise andventricular function decreases (Mirski et al . 2007). Bubbles trapped in the pulmonary vasculature act as inflammatorystimuli and result in interstitial fluid leakage and rapid alveolarfluid accumulation resulting in pulmonary oedema and arterialblood gas changes consistent with hypoxaemia and reducedventilation, leading to increased hypercarbia with reducedend-tidal CO 2(Mirski et al . 2007). The cause of the neurological signs is less clear and is probably due to either cerebralhypoxia from cardiac insufficiency, or right-to-left shunting ofair leading to paradoxical embolism, where air enters theright-sided circulation but results in left-sided emboli, typically cerebral arterial embolism (Han et al . Park et al . 2010). Causes of paradoxical embolism may be as simple as a patentforamen ovale (present in 20-30% of human patients), or maybe due to intrapulmonary shunting and overloading by air ofthe capillary bed within the damaged lung, furtheringventilation-perfusion mismatch and cellular trauma (Mirskiet al . 2007). Overall, in human patients, the mortality from catheter-associated VAE is 30% and higher when emboli areassociated with severe comorbidities such as trauma ormultiple-organ failure (Sviri et al . 2004). Venous air embolism is usually diagnosed by a consistent clinical history plus evidence of air within the vasculature.Although radiography, computed tomography and magneticresonance imaging are feasible in man, their use in equids isrestricted to small ponies and foals. Echocardiography is oftensuccessful in showing air in the right atrium using standardtechniques, although transoesophageal echocardiographycan detect as little as 0.02 ml/kg bwt of injected air in humanpatients and is used for real time monitoring in high-riskneurosurgical procedures (Wong and Irwin 2005). On cardiacauscultation, both horses and human patients with VAEoccasionally show a 'mill wheel', 'washing-machine' or'drum-like' murmur caused by blood mixing the rightventricle (Mirski et al . 2007; Pellegrini-Masini et al . 2009). Additionally described in man is continuous cough, the 'gaspreflex' (a classic gasp emitted when the air embolus reachesthe pulmonary circulation), dizziness or vertigo, nausea,substernal chest pain, agitation, disorientation or a 'sense of impending doom', pulmonary artery hypertension, distension/increased pressure, haemoptysis, hypercapnia with decreased end-tidal dioxide,hypoxaemia, and, rarely, air bubbles visible by fundoscopy inthe retinal vessels, crepitus over superficial vessels and livedo , a lacey purplish discolouration of the skin (Natal 2013). Treatment of VAE in horses is largely supportive (Pellegrini-Masini et al . 2009), although in man attempts to aspirate air either through an existing right-sided central linepositioned at the highest point of the right atrium have beendescribed (van Hulst et al . 2003). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has long been advocated when available to speed thereabsorption of the nitrogen bubbles by increasing partialpressure of oxygen in the blood and thus increasing the partialpressure gradient of nitrogen across the alveolar membrane(Mirski et al . 2007; Kjeld et al . 2012), although recent studies in a swine model did not demonstrate improved neurologicaloutcomes (Weenink et al . 2013). Nonetheless, in equine veterinary facilities with access to a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, its use may be warranted especially if started by 6 hafter air entrainment (Kjeld et al . 2012). A more experimental approach, but perhaps in some ways more plausible forveterinarians than human physicians due to the comparativelyless onerous regulations regarding the use of novel therapies,is perfluorocarbon infusion. Perfluorocarbon has 100,000times the solubility of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogencompared to plasma (Mirski et al . 2007), and has been shown in several experimental models to have salutary effects onneurological and cardiopulmonary indices after experimentalVAE (Cochran et al . 1997; Eckmann and Lomivorotov 2003). In the case described by Romagnoli et al . (2014), diagnosis was made presumptively based on the congruence of clinicalsigns to those described previously. However, ideally,immediate effort should be made to document intravascularair including echocardiography of the right heart, carefulcardiac auscultation, and, if relevant, post mortem examination performed with VAE as a differential diagnosisprior to opening the heart or vasculature to room air.Prevention remains speculative, although using insufflationgases such as carbon dioxide, which is absorbed andexcreted more rapidly than nitrogen-rich room air, may beworth considering especially in cases of severe cystitis whenmacerated bladder mucosa might offer greater surface positionBII I AA BFig 1: I.

This paper reports 4 cases developing anonstrangulating segmental volvulus of the small intestine aftergastroscopy at 3 referral institutions ove r a 2 year period. After performing diagnostic gastroscopy, all horses developedacute and severe clinical signs of colic unresponsive tomedical management. Time range between gastroscopy and onset of colic signs varied from 10 min to 3 h. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a nonstrangulating segmental volvulus ofthe small intestine that was manually corrected without needfor resection in all horses. In all cases, affected small intestinewas severely gas distended. Three of those horses survived todischarge and were alive at follow-up. One horse wassubjected to euthanasia 2 days after surgery due to diffuseintestinal lymphoma. Introduction Gastroscopy is a procedure frequently performed in veterinarymedicine and is the most common technique used for gastricevaluation in horses. Indications for gastroscopy include butare not limited to: acute, chronic or recurrent colic; poorperformance; poor body condition or weight loss; decreasedappetite; oesophageal abnormalities; and behaviouralproblems. Many of these areassociated with equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS), apathological entity and mature horses Gastric Ulcer Council 1999; Murray al . 2001; Bell et al . 2007; Videla and Andrews 2009). Before gastroscopy, it is recommended to withhold food and water to allow for emptying and appropriate visualisationof the stomach. Suggested fasting time varies from 6 to 48 h forfood and 0 to 12 h for water (Brown et al . 1985; Murray et al . 2009; Tamzali et al . 2011). During the procedure, variable amounts of air (3-5 l) are pumpedthrough the biopsy channel of a 2-3 m endoscope to allowdistension of the stomach and improve visualisation (Kihuraniet al . 2009). This air tends to be evacuated at the end of the procedure by suction through the biopsy channel. The firstarea to be examined is the greater curvature of the stomach,continuing with the margo plicatus , the lesser curvature and the cardia as the endoscope is advanced. To allowvisualisation of the and pylorus, the endoscope isredirected further distally and ventrally, crossing the remains ofgastric fluid and content in the most dependent area of the stomach. Once in this area, duodenum can be explored, untilthe major duodenal papilla, advancing the endoscope duringperistaltic waves of the pylorus. During the examination,content adhered to the stomach mucosa is rinsed with waterpumped through the biopsy channel and excess of stomach fluid can be aspirated by suction (Brown et al . 1985; Murray et al . 2001). Gastroscopy time will greatly depend on the amount of content remaining in the stomach, completeness ofthe examination and experience of the operator. To our knowledge, there are no reported complications after gastroscopy in horses other than anecdotal comments ofmild colic episodes not requiring surgery, which were mostlikely to be associated with gaseous distension of the stomachdue to air insufflation during the procedure. This multicentrestudy describes the development of small intestinal segmentalvolvulus in 4 cases associated with recent gastroscopicexamination ( 3 h). In all cases the small bowel volvulus was nonstrangulating, resulting in intestinal injury but not necrosisnecessitating resection and anastomosis. This is probably dueto the acute development of colic in the hospital and minimaltime taken to perform surgical correction. Case 1 Clinical history A 3-year-old Standardbred female used for racing wasevaluated for weight loss starting 3 weeks prior to admission.The physical examination upon admission was unremarkableother than poor body condition. An initial diagnosticevaluation including blood tests, transabdominal ultrasound, abdominocentesis and palpation of the abdomen per rectum revealed mild hypoalbuminaemia (21 g/l; reference range25-35 g/l), mild thickening of the small intestine on ultrasoundand mild caecal distension with gas on palpation per rectum . The following day an oral glucose absorption test wasperformed after 12 h of fasting and results were compatiblewith partial malabsorption. At that point, a gastroscopicevaluation was recommended to obtain duodenal biopsiesdue to the suspicion of malabsorption secondary to small bowel infiltrative disease. Gastroscopic findings At the conclusion of the glucose absorption test at 14.30 h (total fasting time of 16 h, with water withheld for 4 h), the fillywas sedated 2014showed significant of the squamous gastric at plicatus 3/4 ) (The Equine Gastric Ulcer Council 1999). Gastroscopy lasted 18 min, including 5 min in the duodenum ( Table 1 ). During the procedure, biopsies of the ulcerated region and the duodenum were obtained andsubmitted for histopathology. This was the only case where airwas not actively evacuated from the stomach by suction;however, the biopsy channel was left open and air escapedpassively from the stomach. Ten minutes after gastroscopy, thehorse became acutely colicky ( Table 1 ). Colic work-up and surgical treatment Colic work-up revealed moderate small intestinal distension on palpation of the abdomen per rectum ; no other abnormalities were noted during the examination. The horse was taken tosurgery due to severe pain despite multiple sedations (2 dosesof xylazine 10.35 potassium days. In surgery,a segmental volvulus of the jejunum was identified andcorrected without for resection and anastomosis of theaffected bowel. During laparotomy, biopsies of severalsegments of the small intestine and mesenteric lymph nodeswere taken and submitted for histopathology. Outcome The filly had an unremarkable post operative period; however,results from biopsy indicated diffuse lymphoma and ownerselected euthanasia 2 days after surgery. Case 2 Clinical history A 4-year-old Warmblood female used for dressage wasreferred for gastroscopic examination with the presentingcomplaint of poor performance. The initial physicalexamination and blood tests were unremarkable; food andwater were withheld for 16 h and 6 h, respectively, before theprocedure. Gastroscopic findings Gastroscopy was not reveal any abnormalities.Gastroscopy time was 15 min, including 2 min in the duodenum ( Table 1 ). Approximately one hour after gastroscopy, the mare developed severe colic symptoms. Colic work-up and surgical treatment Colic work-up findings included: tachycardia (60 beats/min)and the small intestine was dilated on ultrasound. Noabnormalities were noted on abdominal palpation per rectum . The horse was taken to surgery due to severe and uncontrollable pain despite sedation with resolved of meglumine41.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. twice daily for 3 days and once daily for 2 more days. A constant rate infusion of lidocaine7 50g/kg administered over 20 min was used for thefirst 24 h after surgery. Outcome The post operative period was unremarkable, intravenousfluids were discontinued 24 h after surgery and hay wasgradually re-introduced after 36 h. The filly went home 7 daysafter surgery with standard exercise recommendations afterventral midline laparotomy (controlled exercise for 90 days).The horse was performing at her previous intended use atfollow-up ( >1 year). Case 3 Clinical history A 10-year-old Quarter Horse female used for barrel racing was examined for a 3-week history of poor performance andcoughing. Blood tests from the referring veterinarian revealedmoderate thrombocytopenia (49 \u00d710 9platelets/l; reference range 125-310 \u00d7109platelets/l). upperairway endoscopy and laryngeal radiographs.

Gastroscopic findings The animal was fasted overnight for 13 h (6 h for water) andassessment of the stomach and duodenum via gastroscopywas performed at 09.30 h prior to induction of anaesthesia inorder to complete the poor performance work-up. Theduration of the examination (30 min total gastroscopy time and 6 min in the duodenum) due to the behaviour of the animal required a larger dose of xylazine of ( grade ) (The Equine Gastric Ulcer Council 1999). Colic work-up and surgical treatment Immediately following gastroscopy, the horse was wereperformed uneventfully. Recovery from anaesthesia wasexcellent but 20 min after returning to the stall, approximately3 h after gastroscopy, the mare developed acute signs ofcolic. The mare was tachycardic (56 beats/min), tachypnoeic(50 breaths/min), and on ultrasound and abdominal palpationper rectum , multiple loops of distended small intestine were detected. Two litres of nasogastric reflux were obtained andabdominocentesis revealed mildly altered abdominal fluid(cloudy yellowish fluid with 81 \u00d710 6nucleated cells/l, 14 reference value forL-lactate <2 mmol/l). The horse did not respond to sedatives 0.35 bwt i.v.) and was taken to A segmental volvulus of distal jejunumand ileum was i.v. once daily) were used for 3 and 4 days, respectively. Outcome During the post operative period, i.v. fluids were discontinued24 h after surgery and refeeding started 15 h after laparotomy.The horse went home 4 days after surgery with instructionsfor controlled exercise during the following 3 months.Omeprazole 104 mg/kg bwt per os once daily was administered during hospitalisation and recommended for 2additional weeks after discharge. At follow-up (18 months),coughing had recently recurred but the mare was healthyotherwise. Case 4 Clinical history A 13-year-old Saddlebred gelding used for showing waspresented for chronic intermittent choking episodes of 2 years'duration, exacerbated during the last 3 months. Upon admission, physical examination was unremarkable. Gastroscopic findings Oesophagogastroscopy was performed under at 11.00 h. The oesophagus did not show any alterations and the stomach was only partially explored due to the presence of gastric content. The animal was admitted as an outpatient and was not fastedbefore the examination. Gastroscopy time was 3 min. Ten minutes after the procedure, the horse became violently colicky ( Table 1 ). Colic work-up and surgical treatment Relevant findings from colic work-up included: tachycardia (56 beats/min), markedly distended loops of small intestine onpalpation of the abdomen per rectum , marked small intestinal wall thickening (9 mm; reference value <3 mm) and dilation on transabdominal ultrasound and mild alteration of the abdominal fluid (cloudy yellowish appearance, 12 g/l total protein and L-lactate 3.5 mmol/l; reference value for L-lactate<2 mmol/l). The horse was severely painful despite sedation (one dose of xylazine 10.4 mg/kg twice daily for 6 days. Outcome Intravenous fluids were administered for 24 h post operativelyand the horse was gradually refed 36 h after surgery. Thegelding remained in the hospital for a total of 14 days tomonitor for signs of choke although signs did not recur. At oneyear follow-up the animal was fully recovered and showing athis previous level of exercise. Discussion The equine stomach can be affected by multiple diseases,including ulceration, neoplasia, parasitism and outflowobstructions, among others. However, diagnostic techniquesare limited and gastroscopy remains the most commontechnique used to determine diagnosis and extent of thedisease. For the gastroscopy procedure, a 2-3 m endoscope isrequired to allow appropriate visualisation of the squamousand glandular gastric mucosa as well as the margo plicatus and the pyloric region. During the procedure, air is generallypumped or insufflated into the stomach through the biopsychannel to improve visibility and manoeuvrability. Althoughtechnically more demanding, the proximal portion of theduodenum up to the major duodenal papilla can also bevisualised during the examination. A recent report described air migration through the small intestine, duodenum in particular, after air insufflation duringgastroscopy in ponies (Kihurani et al . 2009). The duodenum was chosen to confirm migration of the air through the smallintestine due to the ease of identification with ultrasound givenits stable position in the abdomen. In this study, the stomach \u00a9 2013 EVJ Ltd143 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE 2014was with 3-4 l over the 6-8 min that gastroscopy lasted and then the stomach and duodenum were monitoredwith ultrasound. Nine out of 10 ponies had a duodenalhyperechoic signal, compatible with air, on the ultrasoundscans immediately after gastroscopy, confirming that theinsufflated air had migrated aborally into the duodenumrather than orally towards the oesophagus. A validexplanation for this phenomenon is the presence of a strong cardiac sphincter and the aboral peristalsis of the gastrointestinal system. In all of our cases, air was pumped intothe stomach during gastroscopy, including pumping smallamounts of air into the duodenum in the 3 cases whereduodenal exploration was achieved. Although an attemptwas made to evacuate air from the stomach in all cases,duration of the examination, amount of air pumped and airdilation of the duodenum during examination may play a role on the amount of air that is able to migrate to the small intestine and potentially produce a segmental volvulus. Webelieve that involvement of the jejunum rather thanduodenum in the segmental volvulus found in these cases isconsequence of the long mesentery associated with thejejunum, making this structure more susceptible to rotate,migrate and even incarcerate as seen in other small intestinalpathologies, as well as the aborad migration of the air. In fact,5/9 and 8/9 ponies did not show gas in the duodenum 1 h and2 h after gastroscopic examination, respectively (Kihuraniet al . 2009). This finding, in combination with the onset of colic signs (ranging from 10 min to 3 h) may be a valid explanationto support aborad migration of air through the small intestineand development of segmental volvulus. In man, transient abdominal dilation may occasionally occur after gastroduodenoscopy if excessive insufflation of airor inadequate decompression of the stomach occurs. Such acomplication rarely requires medical assistance; however,caecal volvulus secondary to gas distension has beenreported al . 1996). The presence of caecal volvulus rather than small intestinal may be due to the lack offixation of the caecum to the abdominal wall (Valsdottir andMarks 2008). In general, small intestinal volvulus is rare in manand tends to be associated to problems in the embryologicaldevelopment of the intestine in newborns or secondary tospecial dietary habits or predisposing lesions in adults (Roggoand Ottinger 1992; Valsdottir and Marks 2008). It has beenshown that insufflation of the bowel with air may also result inrotation and twisting of the affected loop (Perry 1983). The 4cases reported here presented a segmental volvulus of thesmall intestine with the affected segment being primarily gasdistended. Gastroscopy time ranged from 3 to 30 min (mean time 16.5 min) and duodenal time was 2 to 6.5 min (meantime 4.5 min). Gastroscopy in Case 3 was abnormally long (30 min) due to the behaviour of the animal during theexamination and may have affected the amount of airmigrating to the small intestine. After gastroscopy, this casewas anaesthetised to receive an elective procedure and thehorse became colicky shortly after recovery. Reduction ofsmall intestinal motility during and after receiving generalanaesthesia with xylazine and ketamine has been shown(Lester et al . 1992). In addition to the air pumped during gastroscopy, general anaesthesia may have contributed orfacilitated the development of volvulus, making a morecomplicated direct association between gastroscopy andvolvulus.All but Case 4 , which presented for chronic choke, were fasted for 13-16 h before gastroscopy. Gastroscopy in Case 4 was brief (3 min) and limited to the squamous gastric mucosadue to the presence of stomach content. It may be less clearthat only gas distension would be the triggering cause ofintestinal volvulus in Case 4 . Although all cases receiving gastroscopy received sedation, decreased gastrointestinalmotility after -2 agonist drug administration is well established and may have also played an important role in Case 4 and contribute in certain fashion in all the others (Kohn andMuir 1988; Elfenbein et al . 2009). Specifically, a nondose- dependent decrease in the amplitude of duodenalcontraction was seen during 50 min after a single dose ofdetomidine and xylazine and butorphanol have beenreported to decrease propulsive motility in the jejunum for upto 140 min (Adams . et al . 1986; Elfenbein et al . 2009). In addition, it has been suggested that the use of repeated doses of -2 agonist may prolonged this decrease in intestinal motility (Kohn and Muir 1988). The incidence of this uncommon complication is 0.3-3.2%/year in the different institutions included in the study,with only one or 2 cases/institution seen in the last 2 years. Weare aware that this number is arbitrary and maybe deceivinggiven that it only takes into consideration the number ofgastroscopies performed during the year when the affectedcase was presented and the fact that the amount ofgastroscopies performed that year for every institution willgreatly affect the percentage. However, the number isreported to provide the reader with a general idea of thepotential incidence of this problem. In conclusion, we report the presentation of acute colic due to segmental volvulus of the small intestine immediatelypost gastroscopy in 4 cases in the last 2 years. The relationshipcause-effect is still unclear but an effort should be made tolimit the amount of air pumped into the stomach during theprocedure due to the likely migration of air to the duodenum.In addition, it may also be prudent to limit the time andamount of air insufflated into the duodenum to a minimum, tominimise sedatives and to decompress the stomach after theexamination.

Sanchez Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.*Corresponding author email: merritta@vetmed.ufl.edu By now, thousands of gastroscopies, and more recently gastroduodenoscopies, have been performed on horses, yet the paper in this issue by Bonilla et al . (2014) appears to be the first to report a potential complication, namely postendoscopic colic caused by a nonstrangulating jejunal volvulus. Such a complication is hardly what one would have expected to be reported, in contrast to traumatic eventsinvolving the stomach or duodenum for instance, and itappears to be unprecedented in other species. Assuming thatthe volvulus was truly induced by the procedure, is theresomething unique about the equine gastrointestinal anatomyor physiology that would allow such a problem to develop,procedural circumstances notwithstanding? Leaving thatrhetorical question hanging for lack of knowledge, what aboutprocedural issues? Bonilla et al . (2014) justly focus on 2 things: 1) the effect of the pre-endoscopy sedatives on intestinalmotility; and 2) the volume of air insufflated into the stomachand/or duodenum during the procedure. Chemical sedation, in contrast to use of a twitch, is now the usual method of restraint during equine gastroduodenoscopy,for the safety of the animal, endoscopist, attendants andequipment, and the maximisation of procedural outcome. Themost commonly used sedatives are the 2-agonists xylazine and detomidine because they induce a rapid onset andrelatively short duration of a (usually) predictable degree ofsedation and analgesia. Dosages used vary somewhatbetween clinicians, institutions and the personality of the horse,but generally revolve around 0.5 these doses, the drugsalso induce a profound transient suppression of both smalland large intestinal motility (Lester et al . 1998; Merritt et al . 1998; Elfenbein et al . 2009). For instance, during continuous recording of intraduodenal pressure changes, Merritt et al . (1998) found that 0.5 mg/kg bwt i.v. of xylazine motility for 30 for 60 min. Unfortunately, this study didnot include a trial involving a detomidine/butorphanolcombination, but the implication is that combiningbutorphanol with an 2-agonist has an additive, if not potentiating, inhibitory effect on equine duodenal motility.Interestingly, in 2 of the 4 cases of post endoscopy volvulusdescribed by Bonilla et al . (2014), butorphanol was given in combination with xylazine or detomidine for the procedureand a third was given butorphanol as part of its induction forgeneral anaesthesia immediately following the procedure. Unfortunately, an indicator of volume of air insufflated is not standard equipment with endoscopy units but mostendoscopists try to keep that volume to a minimum, forobvious reasons. Nevertheless, it is quite easy to become soinvolved in trying to obtain the optimal view, that one loses track of the insufflation volume, particularly for relatively inexperienced endoscopists. Fortunately the adult equinestomach is capacious and strong enough to deal withrelatively large volumes, but that is not the case for the foal;one of us (A.M.M.) recalls a gastric rupture occurring becausea large volume of insufflated air was introduced but notremoved prior to withdrawal of the endoscope. Bonilla et al . (2014) point out that they allowed air to escape through the biopsy channel before removing the endoscope. However, the intragastric pressure would have to increase verysignificantly above that identified in healthy horses at a walk(14-19 mmHg) to provide a positive gradient aboveatmospheric pressure (approximately 760 mmHg at sea level)and promote spontaneous expulsion (Lorenzo-Figueras andMerritt 2002). Thus, this routine probably allows for minimalescape without suction. As the study by Kihurani et al . (2009) demonstrates, any remaining air will be more likely to leave thestomach via the pyloric rather than the cardiac sphincterbecause of the relative laxity of the former. At the doses ofxylazine and detomidine commonly used for sedation, it isunlikely that gastric emptying rate would be significantlyaffected (Doherty et al . 1999; Sutton et al . 2002; Fintl and Ihler 2011). Thus, air from the stomach, combined with thatinsufflated directly into a chemically relaxed small intestine,could conceivably collect in a volume sufficiently largeenough to induce a volvulus, perhaps when the motility in theinvolved segment returns. The fourth case in the described report is particularly interesting, in that it did not receive butorphanol and thegastroscopic procedure only lasted 3 min, leaving minimaltime for air insufflation. Perhaps repeated sedation forrecurrent oesophageal obstruction prior to admission mayhave played a role in altered motility. But, this is purelyspeculative. So, in the final analysis, Bonilla et al . (2014) rightly recommend prudent application of both chemical sedativesand insufflated air, combined with post endoscopy gastricdecompression. We further suggest that mixing butorphanolwith the 2-agonist be avoided except in the most needy circumstances, and that suction be applied to the biopsychannel to maximise decompression.

Colles*, A. Nevinand J. Avonvale period, 51 horses showing chronic lameness or gait abnormality that was not fully responsive to veterinary treatment at other referral clinics were referred to us for further treatment. All had either failed to have a diagnosis made, ortreatment for the diagnosed conditions had shown only partialresponse. After further examination, we concluded that theyshowed abnormal function of the neck or back, but there wasno obvious pathological cause. A diagnosis of 'somaticdysfunction' was made, characterised by altered muscle tone,tenderness or subtle changes in gait, similar to the conditionrecognised in human medicine. These cases subsequentlyunderwent osteopathic treatment under sedation. Forty-sixcases (90.2%) responded to treatment in the short term (6months after treatment). Seventeen (53.1%) were working atthe same level or better than previously at least a year aftertreatment. Ten (31.2%) worked at a reduced level for between1.5 and 10 years. Nineteen cases were lost to long-termfollow-up. The findings of this study suggest that neck and backproblems may be overlooked when investigating chroniclameness. When no pathology can be pinpointed as a causeof lameness, a diagnosis of somatic dysfunction as a primaryproblem should be considered. The presence of somaticdysfunction as a secondary complicating factor should not beoverlooked. Stiffness and/or low grade pain in the spine ofhorses can result in persistent abnormal posture, gait, orbehaviour, similar to 'somatic dysfunction' seen in the humanpatient. The cause is neuromuscular in origin, rather thanresulting from tissue pathology. The diagnosis made clinicallycan be confirmed with thermography. This study confirms thatosteopathic manipulation of the spine of horses can be avaluable treatment for cases of lameness that do not respondfully to standard veterinary treatments. Introduction Back pain in the horse is a commonly diagnosed conditionin general practice, but the precise causes are frequentlyunknown. Jeffcott (1980) reported on the examinationand diagnosis of 443 horses with back pain. In 118 (26.6%)cases, no pathological lesions were detected in the backradiographically or clinically. The remaining 287 showed atotal of 405 lesions, assumed to be related to back pain. Ofthese lesions, 50% were soft tissue and 50% bone in origin.Unfortunately, from the data given it is not possible to ascertainhow many showed only soft tissue pathology. This was aselected referred population of cases, so it is not possible fromthis to conclude the proportion of horses with back pain thatshow no underlying bone pathology. As many of the casesin Jeffcott's series had previously received chiropractic treatment or physiotherapy, it was concluded that such treatments were not effective (personal communication). Working in a mixed first opinion and referral environment, the authors have found that many horses have been treatedby chiropractors, physiotherapists and osteopaths prior to ourexaminations. Based on our experience, however, we havecome to recognise that many horses with back pain arehelped or cured by selected complementary treatments -resolved cases are not sent on to referral centres, which in ouropinion may be one reason for some referral centresunderestimating the value of manipulative techniques. Wehave concluded that many of the cases we are seeing, whichhave no underlying bone lesion, are similar to somatic dysfunction in man. This is a condition where chronic symptoms of pain, stiffness and loss of function occur in the absence ofpathological lesions and relate to abnormal function of theneuromuscular system (Williams 1997; Pusey et al . 2010), probably resulting from single or repetitive trauma. This study is intended to highlight the existence of somatic dysfunction as a significant entity, present in many equinelameness cases. It may be a primary cause of lameness, or anadditional problem complicating treatment. It also shows thevalue of osteopathic treatment in resolving selected lamenesscases. Materials and methods Fifty-one horses showing signs of neck or back dysfunctionwere included in this study. These horses were characterisedclinically by reduced movement or abnormal movement ofareas of the spine. All the cases had previously been referredby their own veterinary surgeons to at least one recognisedreferral centre prior to referral to the authors. Twelve referralcentres were involved, all having an RCVS or Europeanrecognised specialist in equine orthopaedics/surgery on thestaff. Full referral notes and history were available from thereferring practitioner and referral centre. The case historieswere assessed in detail, and all cases then underwent afurther lameness examination. Where frank lameness wasstill present, this was investigated where appropriate,using standard techniques, to eliminate lameness due todetectable pathology. Where radiographic and scintigraphicexaminations had been carried out previously, reports wereavailable in all cases. Further radiographs were obtained ofthe cervical and thoraco-lumbar spine where clinicallyindicated, but we relied on the previous referral centre'sinterpretation of scintigrams, which were not repeated. Thediagnosis of somatic dysfunction (seen as spinal pain and/or148 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014reduced spinal mobility) was made on clinical examination, and confirmed using infrared thermography. For inclusion in the trial, cases had to meet the following criteria: 1. The authors had to be satisfied that any specific pathological lesions previously diagnosed were no longerclinically significant. 2. A diagnosis of somatic dysfunction (reduced mobility of the spine with no pathological lesion being detected), hadto be agreed on clinical grounds on both veterinary andosteopathic examinations. 3. Confirmation of somatic dysfunction had to be made thermographically (Colles and Brooks 2011). Once the diagnosis of somatic dysfunction had been confirmed, the horses were treated by a registered osteopath in conjunction with a veterinary surgeon, using standardosteopathic techniques as appropriate for each case (Puseyet al . 2010). Response to treatment was assessed by the authors, initially at repeated treatments (every 2-6 weeks), then 6-8weeks after the horse returned to work, and at least 6 monthsafter the horse returned to work. This included assessmentof the owner/rider history, a clinical examination, and athermographic examination, extensive clinical notes beingmade at every examination. Subsequently a written surveywas made at least one year after the final treatment, toascertain if the horse was still in work, and what level thehorse was working at. If no reply was received this wasfollowed up by phone calls where possible. Finally cases wereagain followed-up by letter and phone, shortly before thepreparation of this paper. Where follow-up information couldnot be obtained the cases were excluded from the trial resultsfrom the date when information was last obtained. Diagnosis of somatic dysfunction Clinical history A detailed case history was obtained, paying particularattention to complaints such as working asymmetrically, orapprehension when saddled. A history of trauma, even 18months or more before the recognised onset of clinical signswas considered significant. The owners' opinion on changes intemperament, in behaviour, and how the horse felt whenridden were considered relevant, even if not apparent at ourown examination. Clinical examination A detailed examination was carried out, broken down asfollows: General stance of the horse Reluctance to stand with the pairs of limbs adjacent andweightbearing was considered abnormal, as was shiftingweight from limb to limb. The presence of kyphosis, lordosis orscoliosis in the thoraco-lumbar region, or a flat, horizontal ormarkedly sloping croup, was noted. The neck in normal horses was held freely in front of the horse, and when looking round (flexing the neck laterally ineither direction) the neck flexed smoothly from top to bottom(cranial to caudal). Any tendency to stand or move with thehead turned or tilted, or with the nose extended, wasconsidered abnormal. These assessments were made by observing voluntary movement, not trying to elicit the range ofmovement manually. Visual assessment of muscles Assessment of muscle bulk was considered important,looking for muscle wastage, and poor or asymmetrical muscledevelopment. Poorly developed muscles in the neck, or along the top line of the horse (e.g. longissimus dorsi and gluteals) suggested possible back dysfunction. Lack of muscle bulk, aswell as muscle wastage was felt to be suggestive of backdysfunction. Increased muscle mass was noted, e.g. increased or over-development of the pectoral muscles was often presentwhen there was poor drive from the hindlimbs. Hypertrophy dorsi in the lumbar region were frequently encountered and were considered indicative of abnormalchronic guarding of these areas. Palpation The quality of muscle tone and function was assessed bypalpation rather than stimulating reflexes and monitoringmovement. Any tenseness or increased muscle tone (not dueto apprehension) was considered significant. Asymmetry ofmuscle tone was particularly noted. The back was palpatedfor thickening of the supraspinous ligament, heat, pain,swelling or asymmetry in the dorsal spinous processes andback muscles, which could indicate an acute injury. The space between the vertical ramus of the mandible and the wing of the atlas was checked for symmetry. With the horse stood square, the tubera coxae and tubera sacralae were palpated to assess one tuber coxa was positioned cranial or dorsal to the other, often associatedwith asymmetry of muscle tone, this was consideredsignificant. Observation moving in hand The horses were all examined moving in hand on a level hardsurface, in straight lines. Note was taken of stride length,and failure to track up evenly at the walk. Inconsistencyof stride or limb placement was considered significant.Excessive or asymmetric movement of the head or quarterswas noted. When trotted, changes from normal movement of head, neck and quarters were considered important. In many cases,the head and neck would be raised, and the back would beheld stiff. Lateral movement of the quarters or a stiff, base-wideaction behind was noted. Failure to track up, and lack of drivefrom the hindlimbs was considered significant. Inconsistency ofgait or a tendency to move on more than 2 tracks was noted. The horses were turned tightly to right and left, keeping the inner forelimb at the axis of the turn. The inner hindlimb shouldcross in front of the outer hindlimb during turning. The head,neck and back should flex laterally in the direction of the turn,without the head being tilted. The ease of performance wasconsidered important. Finally the horses were walked backwards, checking for consistent and symmetrical hindlimb stride length, normalmovement of the lumbar spine with no muscle spasm, andassessing whether the horse moved naturally in a straight line.Apprehension and/or excessive tail swishing were also takeninto consideration. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd149 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014Laboratory examinations In cases with acute back pain or muscle spasm, blood samples were tested for the muscle enzymes aspartateaminotransferase and creatine kinase to eliminaterhabdomyolysis. Nerve blocks Nerve blocking of limbs was carried out as appropriate toensure cases with a primary limb lameness were not admittedto the trial. Blocking areas of the back was not carried out, asthere were no cases where overriding dorsal spinous processeswere considered significant. Local anaesthesia was not used to confirm other sources of back pain (see discussion). Radiography Radiography of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine was carried out using lateral views if not available from the initialreferral practice. A fixed 150 kV 1250 mA unit (Indico 100 radX-ray generator) 1was used, with rare earth film and screen combinations, or computerised digital radiography (Butleret al . 2008). Any cases showing significant bone pathology had already been eliminated from the trial, but minor changesand positional abnormalities, particularly in the cervical area,were noted. Thermography Infrared thermography was carried out using an infraredthermography camera (Thermovision 580) 2linked to a visual display unit. Images were stored digitally, and as hard copies.Examinations were made in a controlled ambient temperatureof 20\u00b0C. Rugs and bandages were removed at least 15 minprior to examination being made, and the horses were notstood in direct sunlight for at least 30 min prior to examination.After patient acclimatisation, images were made of the neck,back, and front and hindlimbs (Colles et al . 1995), allowing comparison between the sides of the horse, and betweenlimbs. Normal findings and significant changes in thermogramshave been described (Colles et al . 1995; Tunley and Henson 2004; Colles and Brooks 2011) and the findings reported inthese texts were used as the basis for thermographic diagnosis. In summary, asymmetry of heat between limbs, or different sides of the horse, and areas >1.5\u00b0C colder than normal were considered significant. Treatment Cases were treated using standard osteopathic techniques(Pusey et al . 2010). Treatment regimes were adapted for each individual case, based on the osteopathic diagnosis made,and response to treatment. Treatment was routinely carriedout under sedation, using butorphanol 0.04 mg/kg bwt). The length of each treatment varied between 10 and 30 min. The number of treatments alsovaried (1 to 14, with an average of 6). Thirty-four cases also received one treatment under general anaesthetic. Eleven had 2 treatments and onereceived 3 treatments under anaesthesia. These were caseswhere areas of the spine could not be fully mobilised undersedation. Standard anaesthetic regimens were followed, isoflurane (Isoflurane-vet 100% inhalationvapour, oxygen. The horses were placed in dorsal recumbency. Treatment times varied from 30 to 120 min. Allmanipulations were carried out by a registered osteopath. Management between treatments and after the final treatment was adapted to each case, trying to encourage gentle controlled movement between treatments. Generally the horses were turned out during the day, but received noridden exercise. Once treatment was completed (i.e. spinalmovement had returned to normal), horses were returned towork gradually; typically they were walked in hand or longreined for 2-4 weeks, before walking under saddle for afurther 2-4 weeks. Initial ridden work was in straight lines.Collected work was introduced gradually once the horsewas progressing satisfactorily. Check examinations werecarried out during return to work. If any abnormality of spinalmovement had recurred, further osteopathic treatment ensured that irregularity of movement was treated promptly as work was re-introduced. In cases with marked musclewastage, the recovery period was extended to allowadequate muscle development before commencing hard orfast work. In extreme cases this took up to 12 months, but mostcases were in full work by 4-6 months. Assessment of response to treatment When the cases were re-examined, we relied on clinicalexamination in hand and thermographic evaluation asdescribed above, as well as discussion with the owner on theirperception of response to treatment. All but 2 cases hadceased being ridden by their owners prior to treatment (eitherbecause of obvious pain, or because of unsatisfactory performance). No horses were exercised or ridden during the course of treatment. The 2 cases were unbroken, but showedmarked abnormality of movement in the field and in hand,and improvement could be assessed as for the other horses.Any attempt to classify the degree of dysfunction wasconsidered too subjective to be useful, as the range andseverity of symptoms were too broad. Subsequent to treatment, we considered that if the horse returned to regular ridden work this was a significant response.We relied on the owners to tell us if the horse was performingbetter, as well, or at a lower level. In some competition horseswe were also able to compare competition success. Results Primary complaint The owner's complaints made to the initial referral centre werevariable, and frequently nonspecific, e.g. 'stiff', through to adefinite history of 'back painful on palpation' ( Table 1 ). Many cases had several primary problems, e.g. failing to work frombehind or not working correctly in one direction. Where asingle primary problem could not be isolated, we have listedmore than one for each horse. Intermittent lameness in front (10 cases) or progressive lameness in hindlimbs (11 cases) was quite common, butalways accompanied by other factors such as change intemperament, behavioural change or stiffness. A further 69problems that developed or progressed subsequent to theexamination at the primary referral centre are also listed. In allcases, other more minor abnormalities were also reported. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd150 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014Primary diagnosis Table 2 lists the diagnoses made in the initial referral centres. In 23 cases no specific cause of the primary problem wasdetermined. In only 5 cases was the diagnosis based on orconfirmed by results of imaging modalities. Radiographic and scintigraphic findings (primary referral clinic) Radiographic examinations were made in 44 cases and scintigraphy in 31. The findings are listed in Table 3 . The significance of scintigraphic findings is based on the primaryreferral centres' interpretation and reports. In 30 cases radiography and scintigraphy were both carried out, but in only 2 cases did the results coincide - onewith a tooth root abscess, and the other with changes at the6/7 cervical facet joint articulation.Thermographic findings Thermography was only carried out at the authors' clinic, andall cases showed significant abnormalities. Generally theseincluded changes in the cervical spine as well as the back,where temperatures recorded were of at least 1.5\u00b0C colderthan normal. Asymmetry between the 2 sides of the horse,and loss of the normal hot dorsal midline stripe were alsofrequently present. During the course of treatment theseabnormalities improved or resolved, and in the horses thatreturned to normal work, a normal thermographic pattern wasre-established once they had returned to regular work. Treatment The results of treatment are summarised in Table 4 , and have been broken down into short-term results (6-12 weeks afterTABLE 1: Signs leading to referral of cases Primary complaints to initial referral centres No.Additional problems detected subsequent to treatment at initial referral centres No. Stiff 14 7 Hindlimb lameness 11 Lameness becoming more severe 7 Intermittent forelimb lameness 10Will not go forward 6 1 Not working from behind 5Will not jump, or erratic jumping 4 5 Difficulty turning one way 4Difficulty getting outline 3 4 Loss of performance 3Back painful/tight 2 4 Disunited in canter 2 2 'Panic attack' whilst being ridden 2 1 Neck spasm/locked 2Bucking when ridden 1 6 Skip in upward transition to trot 1Sweaty patch on neck 1Roach back 1Napping 1Sensitive around poll 1Head tilt 1 1 Ears back when worked 1Kicking out when ridden 1 3 Pacing 1 Difficult to lift hind leg/shoe 4Difficult to tack/resents being ridden 4Does not track up 3Cannot do lateral work 2Mild ataxia 2Loss of top line muscle 2Falling over 1Hangs one way 1Will not allow tail to be bandaged 1Cold backed 1Grinding teeth 1Pelvis tilt 1Shaking head 1Cannot lock carpus 1Saddle slipping 1Rushing fences 1Bad tempered 1 Total 51 cases 78 69 The left hand columns include primary complaints leading to initial referral.

Short-term results Results of short-term treatment (6-12 weeks after the end oftreatment) showed that 46 cases (90.2%) of the 51 casesreturned to work. Of these, 10 cases (19.6%) were performingbetter than previously. Nine (17.6%) responded to treatment,but could only work at a lower level than previously; two ofthese worked for more than 3 years, and 5 worked for at least2 years, but required ongoing manipulative therapy. Onehorse worked intermittently for 2 years before developinglaminitis. Five horses (9.8%) failed to respond adequately totreatmen t-3o f these completed a full course of treatment, appearing to have regained normal spinal function, but theyrelapsed as soon as they returned to work, and so were notable to be ridden, and were humanely destroyed. Three didnot finish treatment, and although the outcome of treatmentin 2 is not known, for the purposes of this paper we haveassumed they were not able to work. Long-term results We were unable to obtain satisfactory long-term follow-upinformation in 19 cases. Of the 10 cases whose performance after treatment was considered better than it had ever been, 2 were sold after oneyear, and were lost to subsequent follow-up. The remaining 8worked for at least one year, and up to 4 years after treatmentended. Of the 7 returning to previous levels of performance,one competed at the Olympics and at international levelfor 7 years after treatment, before retiring from top-levelcompetition. Of the remaining 6, 2 were treated as foals,and are still unbroken, but are reported to be moving andbehaving normally, and 2 have started normal work, but have not yet completed a year since the end of treatment. In summary, 53.1% of cases treated have maintained serious work for at least 12 months at the previous or a betterlevel of work, 31.2% have returned to work at a lower level thanpreviously, and 15.6% have shown an unsatisfactory long-term response. Discussion Fifty-one cases were examined having previously been examined and treated at other referral centres. In 8 cases the primary referral centre had failed to identify any clinical abnormality. Assessment of the histories in these cases showedthese were primarily recognised when ridden, and hadpersisted or progressed prior to referral to us. The remainingcases had failed to respond fully or at all to the treatmentgiven, and abnormalities had remained. We were able toidentify abnormal spinal movement and or gait abnormalitiesin all cases, and also abnormalities in the thermograms made of the neck and back. Subsequent to osteopathic treatment, there was improvement in the condition of 90% of cases shortterm (6-12 weeks after the end of treatment), with a long-termimprovement of 84% of cases available for follow-up (1-7 yearsafter the end of treatment). The cause of spinal dysfunction and back pain in man is difficult to diagnose. It is recognised that imaging techniquesshowing bony changes have a poor correlation torecognised pain or function (Kendrick et al . 2001; Little 2002). More sophisticated imaging techniques such as magneticresonance imaging also have a poor specificity in man (Scottet al . 1990). In this series, with one exception, there is no correlation between x-ray and scintigraphy, and the originaldiagnosis. There was also only one case showing radiologicaland scintigraphic evidence of spinal pathology. This is in linewith the literature on human cases of back pain, and suggeststhat spinal dysfunction in these cases was not related topathological lesions. We found clinically that all the cases hadreduced spinal movement at various levels, but not all showedlocalised pain. We conclude that this is similar to the humancondition described as 'somatic dysfunction' (Peters et al . 1994; Williams 1997). In the one case showing changes both onx-ray and scintigraphy in the facet joint at C6/7, the primaryreferral clinic diagnosed forelimb lameness resulting from thislesion. This was treated by steroid injection into the facet joint,but the horse remained lame. After osteopathic treatment, thishorse evented at a higher level for more than a year. This mayindicate more than one cause of lameness was present, or thejoint lesion may have been secondary to reduced spinalmovement elsewhere putting excessive strain on this joint, withresultant synovitis. All the cases showed abnormal thermograms prior to treatment. These improved with treatment of the cases, andthe thermographic improvement coincided well with theclinical assessments before, during and after treatment.Thermography in human patients with known back pain dueto lumbar disc herniation has shown high sensitivity (Kimand Cho 1994) and thermographic changes correlateclosely after surgery with a high sensitivity to the clinicalresults and symptoms (Kim and Cho 1994). These findings ofthermographic images correlating with clinical signs of backdysfunction are in line with previous reports in horses (Colleset al . 1995; Tunley and Henson 2004; Colles and Brooks 2011).TABLE 2: Diagnoses made at the initial referral centres Diagnosis No. Back pain of unknown origin 6 No abnormality of gait detected 6 High suspensory desmitis - hind leg 5High suspensory desmitis - fore leg 1Sacroiliac joint disease 3Hind limb lameness of unknown origin 3 Generalised stiffness of unknown origin 3 Neurological abnormality of unknown origin 3 Arthropathy of C5/6 or C6/7 2Behavioural problem 2Forelimb lameness heels - forefeet 2Fetlock synovitis thrombosis 1Poor mismatch 1Head shaker 1Total 51 Italics indicate diagnosis of a condition with an undiagnosedcause (45% of cases). \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd152 EQUINE VETERINARY / AE / MARCH 2014The basic concept of somatic dysfunction is that symptoms and loss of function occur in the absence of pathologicaldisease and relate to abnormal function of the neuromuscularsystem (Williams 1997), probably resulting from trauma. Inmany human cases, as in many of our equine series, nospecific traumatic episodes have been recorded, and it issuggested that the condition may frequently result fromrecurrent minor trauma over a period of time. Traumastimulates paravertebral and peripheral muscle spasm as aprotective response (He et al . 1988). At the same time, sympathetic activity in the lateral horn of the spinal cord,causes reduced blood flow to the skin, with a concomitantchange in thermographic images. These changes becomechronic in some cases, with resultant chronic reduction in spinal movement. If nociceptor activity is intense or prolonged, it can cause changes in structure and chemistry ofinterneurones in the spinal cord (Mantyh et al . 1995). This lowers the threshold for interneurone firing (facilitation), andmay be an underlying mechanism for hyperaesthesia, andpain response in the patient (Colles and Brooks 2011). The clinical signs of somatic dysfunction in man are subtle, and involve tenderness, altered muscle tone and autonomicchanges. Diagnosis and treatment both rely primarily on theclinical and manual skills of the clinician (Williams 1997).The condition may result in peculiar gait, or may onlybe evident when stressed by abnormal posture. Typicalsymptoms include: asymmetry of joint movement, asymmetryof anatomical landmarks, changes in palpable tissue texture, and tissue tenderness (often referred sensitivity at a point awayfrom the area of dysfunction). These findings are similar tothose of this series of cases. Our initial back examinations werebased on traditional assessments (Jeffcott 1981), however weconcluded that this primarily detected recent acute injuries.The cases in this series were chronic, and observation ofreduced movement was more significant than perception ofpain. The causal injury or injuries may have occurred, but notbeen recognised by the owner as significant, sometime beforea crisis or further acute injury resulted in treatment beingsought. The horses involved had all undergone examinationsby experienced orthopaedic clinicians, but they hadunderstandably failed to relate the vague or more subtle signs to somatic dysfunction, searching for a pathological lesion to account for clinical signs, or for persistent signs in cases thatfailed to respond to treatment. We did not use nerve block or regional infiltration to confirm our diagnoses other than to exclude primary limblameness. In somatic dysfunction, areas of pain are oftenaway from the primary area causing the problems. This can bethe result of facilitation or increased use of a joint caused byreduced movement elsewhere (e.g. sacroiliac pain may resultfrom reduced movement in the lumbar spine causingincreased movement of the sacroiliac joint). Problems canoccur throughout the spine, when reduced movement in onesegment results in increased mobility of adjacent areas,TABLE 3: The radiographic and scintigraphic findings reported by referral centres, and diagnosis based on imaging results Principle changes reportedRadiographic findingPrimary scintigraphic findingAdditional scintigraphic findingDiagnosis based on findings abnormalities detected 29 12 NR C5/6 and/or C6/7 joints 5 4 0 1 x-ray1 both Tarsus NR 4 NR 3 5Humerus NR 1 0Cheek tooth 1 1 0 Incidental finding Radial chip fracture 1 NR NR 1Front pastern NR 1 0 phalanges (hind) NR 3Proximal NR Stifle joint NR 1 0Navicular bone front) 1 1 NR NRThoracic articular 0 Caudal thoracic facet joint NR 0 1Distal radius NR 0 1Total abnormal findings 44 31 17Examination not carried out 7 20 Primary scintigraphic findings were those reported as likely to have clinical significance.Additional scintigraphic findings were reported as unlikely to have clinical significance.A number indicates the number of horses in which this finding was made.0 indicates scintigraphy was carried out but no significant findings in the listed category were made.NR indicates this finding was not recorded in any cases where this imaging modality was used. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd153 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014causing inflammation. Joint inflammation in limbs may also be secondary, resulting from changes in limb flight affectingloading on limb joints. Many of these cases showed abnormalgait due to increased muscle tone causing reduced jointmovement, rather than the gait abnormality being due to pain. The infiltration of anaesthetic in the region of accessory joints, or into apaxial muscles cannot prove the presence orabsence of somatic dysfunction elsewhere. Although it is frequently assumed that 'soft tissue' injuries will recover with rest, it appears that this is not always the case.These horses showed abnormal gait or posture for long periodsprior to treatment, and 90% responded to treatment. Theshort-term response to treatment is remarkably good,especially as these cases had all undergone unsuccessfulconventional treatments previously. The longer-term response(in excess of 12 months) of up to 53% returning to andmaintaining their previous level of work or better, and manycompeting at that level is also very encouraging. As with anycondition there are cases that failed to respond fully orpermanently to treatment. We believe that this probablyreflects the severity of trauma initiating the problems, and thetime for which somatic dysfunction has been present. It alsoseems likely that injuries occurring early in life establish agreater degree of neurological change than injury later in life,where a normal neurological pattern has been wellestablished. There is evidence that the success or failure oftreatment also depends on owners being prepared to bringhorses back slowly into work, helping to re-establish thepatterns of normal tissue function, and being prepared tocontinue manipulative therapies during this period to ensurethat horses continue to move normally, and do not regress withrecurrent stresses on the neuromuscular systems.The short-term results were based on our own clinical assessments, made in standard conditions at our clinic. Clinicalimprovement coincided well with alterations in thethermographic patterns towards normal. Long-term results arebased on the assessment of the rider, and competition results where appropriate. Follow-up information based on rider/owner assessment is notoriously unreliable. In these cases,however, we started with horses that were not being ridden asthey could not perform to the riders/owners' expectations,and we based our assessment of success on the horse's abilitysubsequently to meet these expectations. We also have agroup of owners who have recognised that initial treatmentsby their own vets and the primary referral practices have notresolved the problem, and we believe their long-termassessments are reliable. This included some very proficientprofessional riders. Authors' declaration of interests No conflicts of interest have been declared.

A. Valentine*, M. B. Calderwood Maysand H. S. Cheramie Oregon State University, Oregon;Florida Vet Path, Inc., Florida; melanoma; neoplasia Summary Information regarding signalment, clinical findings, treatment and outcome of 5 previously reported cases of anaplastic malignant melanoma of the tail in non-grey horses and of 5 additional cases are summarised. Age was recorded for 9horses and mean age was 16 years, range 8-23 years. Genderwas recorded for 8 horses and 6 of these 8 horses were malehorses over 14 years of age. The most common coat colourwas bay (6 horses). Other coat colours were palomino (onehorse), chestnut (one horse) and black (one horse); coatcolour of one non-grey horse was not specified. Follow-up information was available for 9 horses and only one horse, a palomino, survived more than 10 months following diagnosisand tail amputation. Surgical excision, including tailamputation and medical therapy with oral cimetidine, was noteffective in non-grey, non-palomino horses. Tumour recurredon tail tissue remaining after amputation in 2 horses,widespread metastases were documented in 4 cases andmetastasis was suspected at the time of death or euthanasia in3 cases, including one case with amputation site regrowth. Nosubjective histopathological differences were detected in thepalomino horse that survived as compared to horses of othercoat colours. Findings suggest that anaplastic malignantmelanoma of the tail in non-grey horses is most often a veryaggressive neoplasm, but that there are rare exceptions. Introduction Melanocytic tumours in horses are well documented (Foleyet Summers 2009; Moore et al . 2013), although still not completely understood. Types of melanocytic neoplasms inhorses are are most common in horses with a grey coat colour (Valentine 1995; MacGillivray et al . 2002; Moore et al . 2013), but occurrence in horses of other coat colours is possible (Mostafa 1953; Pascoe and Summers Valentine 1995; Floyd Tyler and Fox 2003; LeRoy et al . 2005; Poore et al . Benign melanocytic as melanocytoma are type of melanocytic to arise in non-greyhorses (Foley et al . 1991; Valentine 1995), but anaplastic malignant melanoma also non-grey horses Valentine 1995; Floyd Tyler and Fox 2003; LeRoy et al . 2005; Poore et al . Diagnosis poorly pigmented melanocytic in and relies on histopathological or cytological examination of tumour cells. Once a diagnosis of melanocyticneoplasia has been made in a non-grey horse it is vitally important to distinguish between melanocytoma, a benign neoplasm (Foley et al . 1991; Valentine 1995) and anaplastic malignant melanoma, which is very aggressive (Mostafa 1995; and Fox 2003; LeRoy et al . 2005; Poore et al . 2013). Information regarding prognosis of different equine melanocytic tumours isvery important when making decisions regarding therapy. Thepotential for malignancy, manifesting as metastatic tumours,has been documented in melanomas occurring in grey horses(Valentine MacGillivray et al . 2002; Moore et al . 2013). However, in many cases, surgical excision of grey horse dermalmelanoma is curative (Valentine 1995), as is surgical excision ofmelanocytoma in grey and non-grey horses (Foley et al . 1991). There is a growing body of literature related to aggressivebehaviour of anaplastic malignant 1995; and Fox 2003; LeRoy et al . 2005; Poore et al . 2013). Location of reported cases of anaplastic malignant melanoma innon-grey horses varies, including 3 cases involving hoof wall orcoronary band in chestnut, bay and Paint horses et al . 1986; Honnas et al . 1990; Floyd 2003) and one case in the nasopharynx of a dark brown horse (Tyler and Fox 2003). Fivereported cases of anaplastic malignant melanoma innon-grey horses occurred in skin of the tail (Mostafa 1953;Pascoe and Summers 1981; Valentine 1995; LeRoy et al . 2005; Poore et al . 2013) suggesting that this may be a common site for anaplastic malignant melanoma in non-grey horses. This report summarises the literature regarding anaplastic malignant melanoma of the tail in non-grey horses anddescribes 5 additional cases. Cases Cases of malignant melanoma of the tail of non-grey horsesconfirmed by histopathological examination were collectedby the first author over a period of 25 years and the literatureregarding malignant melanoma in non-grey horses reviewed.Five previously reported cases and 5 additional cases are summarised in Table 1 . Signalment and clinical history Age was recorded for 9 cases and mean age of affected horses was 16 years, range 8-23 years. The most common coatcolour was bay (6 cases). Other coat colours were palomino(one case), chestnut (one case) and black (one case). Theonly information available for one horse was that it wasnon-grey. Males were most commonly affected (one stallion, 5156 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014geldings), with 2 affected mares. Gender of 2 horses was not reported. Locations within the tail were described as ventrum(5 cases), lateral (2 cases), dorsum (one case), midtail (one case) and end of the tail (one case). Tumours on the tail weremost often single tumours (8 cases). Case 1 had multiple tail tumours and Case 9 had 2 tail tumours. Tumours were typically multilobular, white, pale tan, grey, black or dark brown in colour ( Figs 1 and 2) and had a smooth ( Cases 1, 6 and 7)t o ulcerated ( Cases 4, 8 and 9) skin surface. The tumour in Case 5progressed from being smooth surfaced to having an ulcerated surface 2 weeks later. The gross appearance of 3 tumours was not described. The tail was the only reported siteof cutaneous mass lesions in 8 horses; Case 1 also had perianal masses and Case 4 multiple similar nodules affecting skin of the face and the shoulder.Treatment and outcome Tail amputation was the most common treatment and was performed in 5 horses ( Cases 2, 5, 7, 8 and 10). Oral cimetidine was given to 2 horses at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg bwt per os t.i.d. for an unknown length of time ( Case 4 ) and 48 mg/kg bwt per osonce daily for 3 days ( Case 9 ). No therapy was attempted in Case 1 and details of therapy were not available for 2 horses (Cases 3 and 6). Follow-up was available for 9 horses and all but the palomino mare ( Case 7 ) had died or been subjected to euthanasia due to tumour complications from one day to 10months following diagnosis of anaplastic malignant melanoma.Tumour recurred on remaining tail tissue following amputation in2 horses ( Cases 5 and 8), widespread metastases were documented in 4 horses ( Cases 1, 3, 9 and 10) and metastasis was suspected in 3 horses ( Cases 2, 4 and 8). Sites of metastasis were not always described, but reported metastatic sites werethigh muscle, spleen, lung, peritoneum, mesenteric lymph node, liver, kidney and bone marrow (Mostafa 1953) and spleen, lung and thigh muscle in Case 9 .Case 7 is still alive at the time of this writing, 5.5 years after diagnosis of anaplastic malignant melanoma of the tail followed by tail amputation.TABLE 1: Summary of 5 previously reported and 5 new cases of malignant melanoma of the tail in non-grey horses Case No. Breed Colour Age (years) Gender Site on tail Treatment Follow-up 1* Arabian Bay 15 Stallion Ventrum None Died in 1 day with metastatic disease 2Unknown Non-grey Unknown Unknown Middle Amputation Died 6 months post surgery, no necropsy 3Morgan Chestnut 23 Gelding End Unknown Died in 10 with metastatic disease 4\u00a7Thoroughbred Bay 14 Gelding Ventrum Cimetidine Suspected metastatic at time of diagnosis 5\u00b6Irish Draught Bay 16 Gelding Lateral Amputation Regrowth at surgical site at 9 months 6 Morgan Bay 20 Unknown Lateral Unknown Unknown 7 Quarter Horse Palomino 8 Mare Ventrum Amputation Alive and well 5.5 years post surgery 8 Peruvian Paso Bay 18 Gelding Dorsum Amputation Subjected to euthanasia 8 months post amputation with regrowth at surgical site and suspected metastatic disease 9 Crossbred Bay 20 Gelding Ventrum Cimetidine Subjected to euthanasia at 7 months with metastatic disease 10 Friesian Black 12 Mare Ventrum Amputation Died at 9 months post surgery with metastatic disease *Mostafa 1953.Pascoe and Summers 1981.Valentine 1995.\u00a7LeRoy et al . 2005.\u00b6Poore et al . 2013.

Lichtensteiger, University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd157 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014Histopathological findings Samples of all tail masses were diagnosed as anaplastic malignant melanoma based on histopathological evidence ofmarked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity (up to 6 mitoses per high power field), varying amounts of intracytoplasmic melanin (generally sparse), tumour necrosisand epithelial, local or lymphatic invasion. No subjectivedifference in histopathological findings was detected in the tumour from the palomino horse that survived at least 5.5 yearscompared to other non-grey horses that died within 10 monthsof diagnosis ( Figs 3 and 4). Discussion Results of this study indicate that anaplastic malignant melanoma in non-grey horses often occurs on the tail and that, with rare exceptions, it is an aggressive tumour leading todeath within a year of diagnosis. Surgical excision, including tail amputation and medical therapy (cimetidine) do not appear to be effective in most cases of anaplastic malignantmelanoma of the tail in non-grey horses. The one case in whichthe tumour did not have an aggressive behaviour was a palomino mare. Interestingly, this was also the youngest horsein the study (8-years-old at the time of diagnosis). Additionalcase studies of anaplastic melanoma of the tail in non-grey horses will be important to improve the ability to predict behaviour and to treat these tumours.

Hockenhull* and H. R. Whay School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol, UK. Veterinary surgeons are required to assess an animal's welfare in a range of different circumstances in the course of their daily work. These assessments may relate to the long-term welfare of an individual animal under their care, or the current welfareof a population of animals that are unfamiliar to them asindividuals. The welfare assessment made may subsequentlyhave implications for the treatment that an animal receives orfor the decision of whether or not an animal should remain in itscurrent home. Yet welfare assessment is not straightforward.Here we review the challenges that welfare assessment presents and review the tools currently available to meet them. Lastly, we look towards the future of equine welfareassessment, with examples of current research to developtools and optimise welfare assessment. Introduction Equine veterinary practitioners are required to makejudgements on the welfare status of equids in a wide variety ofcircumstances, whether in routine examinations, prior totreatment or euthanasia, following surgery, during competitionsor as part of a veterinary report for prosecuting welfare cases.When UK veterinary surgeons register with the Royal College ofVeterinary Surgeons they promise to ensure the welfare ofanimals committed to their care (Hewson 2006; RCVS 2010).Similarly, the US Veterinarian's Oath has recently been revised tospecifically include the protection of animal welfare, alongsideanimal health (AVMA 2010). Consequently, clients may expectveterinary practitioners to be experts in welfare issues (Hewson2003a; Radford 2004). However, there are no universallyaccepted definitions of good or bad animal welfare, and no'one-size-fits-all' assessment protocol on which to basejudgements of welfare. In this review, we will outline how welfarecan be defined and discuss some of the equine welfareassessment tools and protocols that are in use today andcurrently being developed by welfare scientists. One definition of animal welfare is the state of an animal as regards its attempts to cope with its environment (Broom 1986).Simply ensuring that an animal is well managed and hassufficient environmental resources does not automaticallyguarantee that the animal will be fit, healthy and have a highlevel of welfare (Hewson 2003a; Whay et al . 2003). But what is perceived as important for animal welfare, above andbeyond meeting basic physiological needs, differs widelybetween individuals. Three broad ethical concerns, andconsequently conceptions of welfare, have been describedto capture this variation (Duncan and Fraser 1997; Fraser et al . 1997). The first concern prioritises the animal's ability to functionnormally, incorporating measures such as health, reproductivesuccess and longevity; the second prioritises the subjectiveexperiences or feelings of the animal, emphasising theimportance of reducing negative feelings, and/or promoting positive experiences; the third concern prioritises the need foranimals to live as natural a life as possible and be able toperform their full repertoire of natural behaviour (Duncan andFraser 1997; Fraser et al . 1997). For most of us, the concept of animal welfare does not match one of these concepts alone, rather a combination of all of them, with different weightings applied as we see fit depending on our personal experienceand the specific situation we are judging. As welfare is such a complex, multifactorial idea it is not surprising that the challenges of defining it are matched by thechallenges of assessing it. Any tool developed for welfareassessment must be valid and reliable (Scott et al . 2003) and be able to be used comparably by the same assessors indifferent situations, as well as by different assessors. To be valida tool must measure the attribute it was designed to measure;this can be confirmed via feedback from experts in the field orby comparison to a gold standard (Scott et al . 2003). Reliability refers to the consistency or repeatability of the measure.Furthermore, any tool must also be feasible for use in the fieldwhere there may be limitations in time and available facilities. A range of different animal needs must be met to achieve good welfare and therefore a range of differentmeasurements are needed to assess it (Rushen 2003; Broomand Fraser 2007). Consequently, welfare assessments need to be holistic, rather than focused solely on one aspect, such as the animal's physical state alone, which is often the area ofprimary concern for veterinary surgeons (Hewson 2003b). Theexperience of veterinary surgeons in integrating information toformulate an opinion is a valuable skill for welfare assessment(Hewson 2003c). This is increasingly important at a time whenpeople in the western world are losing their close connectionto nature, which may cloud their ability to make objectiveanimal welfare judgements (Baker and Turner 2000); veterinarysurgeons are therefore in a unique position to advise andguide their clients towards optimising the welfare of theiranimals. Levels of welfare assessment Equids are unique among our domestic animals, as they arenot truly a production or a companion animal, and theirwelfare status is often overlooked in comparison to otherdomestic species. However, evidence of our concern for thewelfare of domestic equids can be found throughout history(Derksen and Clayton 2007), from Xenophon in Anna Sewell relatively little research has beenconducted on equine welfare, particularly concerning thedevelopment of protocols for welfare assessment (Minero andCanali 2009). However, there are indications that interest in thisfield is increasing (Minero and Canali 2009) and here we159 \u00a9 2014 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014discuss some of the methods for assessment of equine welfare, both at the level of the population and the individual,described in published studies. Welfare assessment of a population Population-based welfare assessments target a specific facetof the equine population, such as racehorses, leisure horses or horses in a particular geographic area, rather than focusing on an individual animal. The data used to assess welfare statusmay come from existing data sources, such as veterinaryrecords (Traub-Dargatz et al . 1991), insurance statistics (Leblond et . 2000; Egenvall et al . 2006) and wastage data (Wallin et al . 2000). These data may focus on a particular welfare indicator, or group of indicators, such as locomotorproblems (Egenvall et al . 2009). If sufficient data do not exist, survey-based data collection techniques may be used to explore specific issues in specific populations. Recentexamples include data collection on the prevalence of recurrent airway obstruction in horses in Great Britain (Hotchkiss et al . 2007), lameness in dressage horses (Murray et al . 2010), behaviour problems in leisure horses (Hockenhull andCreighton 2013), health status and disease in geriatric horses(Ireland et al . 2011), and health problems in horses in Michigan (Kaneene et al . 1997). Some of these survey-based studies take their data collection one step further by personally examining a sampleof individual horses within their target population. For example,Luthersson et al . (2009) examined 201 horses to investigate the distribution and prevalence of gastric ulceration in Danishleisure horses and Wyse et al . (2008) scored the body condition of 319 Scottish horses to examine the prevalence of obesitywithin this population. In a broader study, exploring the welfareof nonracing horses on Prince Edward Island, an ownerquestionnaire covering the horse's daily routine and behaviourwas used in conjunction with each animal receiving acomplete physical examination, which included a dentalexamination, hoof check, gait evaluation, body conditionscore and a faecal assessment of parasite burden, by aveterinary surgeon (Christie et al . 2004, 2006). Welfare assessments of populations of working equids are typically based on data from physical examinations andbehavioural tests rather than from existing databases or surveydata. They usually have much larger sample sizes and includea larger number of parameters than assessments conductedon other equine populations (Pritchard al 2010; Popescu and Diugan 2013). While such population-based studies provide valuable information on the welfare of defined populations as regardsspecific welfare concerns, veterinary surgeons are moretypically involved with welfare assessment at the level of anindividual animal. Welfare assessment of an individual The welfare of an individual animal can be assessed in theshort or long term. The measures used can be invasive ornoninvasive, animal-based or resource-based, subjective orobjective, or combinations of any and all of these (for anoverview see Appleby and Hughes 1997; Broom and Fraser2007). It is, therefore, important that any welfare assessmenthas a well-defined objective, as this will influence the typeof assessment measures chosen. The fundamental objectiveof a welfare assessment is to quantify and/or classify ananimal's welfare by assigning a numerical value, or categorising a state/object according to the qualities of theattribute of interest (Scott et al . 2003). Assessment measures predominantly take the form of rating scales, be they ordinal (i.e. ordered categories, for example mild, moderate, severe),or interval (i.e. measurements on a continuous scale where thedistance between points is known and defined) (Scott et al . 2003). These may be used independently or in combinationdepending on the primary objective of the welfareassessment. The most widely used framework upon which animal welfare assessment measures are applied is the Five Freedoms that originated in the Brambell Report and have since beenrefined by the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC 1993). Section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 (HMSO 2006) uses a derivative version of this framework to outline the animal needsthat those responsible for an animal have a duty to ensure aremet. The RSPCA follow this same version when advising petowners, including horse owners, how best to meet therequirements of the Welfare Act and to safeguard the welfareof their animal (RSPCA 2011). The assessment measuresreviewed here will be discussed within the framework of the Five Freedoms. Table 1 -4summarise these measures and briefly describes their limitations. Freedom from hunger and thirst and freedom from discomfort Welfare assessments within these 2 freedoms typically employ resource-based rather than animal-based measures (Samuelet al . 2012), focusing on the suitability of the animal's physical environment, including the provision of essential amenitiessuch as water, shelter and a comfortable area to rest, andthe appropriateness of the animal's diet (FAWC 2003).However, assessments should also employ animal-based measures, such as the skin tent turgor test fordehydration (Hastie 2001) and body condition scoring (Greenand Tong 2004). Such an assessment should also considerwhether the horses species specific needs are being met; forexample, does their feeding regime include sufficient forageto meet their physiological requirements as well as satisfy theirbehavioural need to graze throughout the day (Benhajaliet al . 2009). Within the assessment, consideration should also be given to the competency of the owner or handler (Whay et al . 2003) to ascertain whether they have adequate understanding oftheir horse's needs to determine whether they are being metor not, and to recognise problems when they arise. The inabilityof some owners to recognise obesity in their animals suggeststhat owners may not perceive that their horse has a problemwhen one exists (Wyse et al . 2008). Consequently, equine veterinary surgeons may need to work with owners to changetheir perceptions and so enable them to identify and meettheir horse's welfare needs. Animal-based measures are not without their own challenges. A number of scales have been derived tomeasure equine body condition; however, to date, no singlescoring system has been agreed or universally adopted.Different body condition scoring systems may utilise 5, 6, or 9point rating scales (Green and Tong 2004), making it difficult tocompare reports based on different scales. The validity of thepinch (or skin tent turgor) test has also been disputed in thecontext of working equids (Pritchard et al . 2006) (Table \u00a9 2014 Ltd160 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014Freedom from pain, injury or disease The assessment of pain in equids is subject to the same challenges that are faced when assessing pain in other nonverbal patients.Pain is a subjective experience, having both sensory andemotional components and, while we can never know exactlywhat an animal is feeling, the aversive nature of pain in animalshas now been generally accepted (Flecknell and Molony 1997;van Loon et al . 2010). Pain in animals is clearly a welfare concern (Flecknell and Molony 1997) but, due to its very nature, pain canonly be assessed indirectly by making value judgements basedon behavioural or physiological indices (Ashley et al . 2005). Attempts have been made to make animal pain assessmentstandardised and objective (see Taylor et al . 2002); however, some subjectivity remains due to the reliance on individualinterpretation of any measurements taken. Pain scoring systems,using either visual analogue scales, simple descriptive scales, ornumeric rating scales, rely on direct observation and scoring maybe greatly influenced by the individual observers' attitudes andprevious experience unless the system has been validated insome way (Taylor et al . 2002). To be truly effective, any pain assessment should cover all dimensions of pain, including intensity, frequency, durationand quality (Ashley et al . 2005). There is research currently underway to develop more reliable and sensitive methods ofpain assessment in horses, including the development ofcomposite multifactorial pain scales (Bussi\u00e8res et al . 2008; van Loon et al . 2010), and a Horse Grimace Scale using facial expressions to assess pain (Love et al . 2011). The development of a standard, reliable and validated tool for equine painassessment would be a valuable addition to any equinewelfare assessment protocol. Problems with the locomotor system can be a significant source of pain in horses (Ashley et al . 2005). In addition to the work currently underway on general pain assessment inequids, work is also progressing to determine the reliability ofassessing lameness and gait abnormalities in horses, usingnumerical rating scales (Fuller et al . 2006; Vin uela-Fern\u00e1ndez et al . 2011), visual analogue scales (Vin uela-Fern\u00e1ndez et al . 2011) and gait analysis technology (Weishaupt et al . 2001; Taylor et al . 2002). The findings of Vin uela-Fern\u00e1ndez et al . (2011) highlight the limitations of subjective scoring systems forlameness assessment, reporting that individual assessorsdiffered in their perception of the degree of lameness seenand that there was an effect of observer experience. Aside from pain and lameness assessment measures, other systems to help with welfare assessment in the short and longerterm may record or rate body damage prevalence, such asthe presence or absence of body lesions and scarring, faecalsoiling and cleanliness (Broom and Fraser 2007; Samuel et al . 2012). The need for reliable, repeatable, validated, objective measures of equine pain, lameness and other pathologies iswell recognised within the industry. As technology develops, itis increasingly being incorporated into assessment measures tohelp objectively quantify various physical signs of underlyingwelfare state, such as the use of digital audio recordings toassess coughing in horses (Duz et al . 2010). As well as profiting from developments in technology, it is hoped that this field willlikewise benefit from the work that has been undertaken onthe development of welfare and pain assessment protocols inworking equids et al . et al . 2010) ( Table 2 ). Freedom to express normal behaviour An animal's behaviour can provide a valuable insight into its subjective state, making the observation of behaviour one ofthe most informative and easily measured welfare assessmentmethods (Mench and Mason 1997). A subjective assessment ofan equid's demeanour is often an early step in utilisingbehaviour to assess welfare (Burn et al . 2010; Popescu and Diugan 2013), but there are numerous other ways thatTABLE 1: Examples of equine welfare assessment measures and their limitations applied to the Freedom from hunger and thirst; Freedom from discomfort Measure Example sources Use and limitations Resources available Presence/absence of resources, for example food, water and shelter.(Christie et al . 2004; Popescu and Diugan 2013)May be assessed via owner questionnaire or site inspection. The accuracy of responses to theowner questionnaire may be compromised(e.g. by reporting perceived desirableanswers, recall bias). Body condition score Visual and physical evaluation of stored body fat on key body regions. The equid is thenassigned a numerical score based oncriteria specific to each scoring system.(Mottet et al 2009; Dugdale et al . 2010)A number of different body condition scoring systems are available, typically using 5-9 pointrating scales. This can make comparisonbetween scoring systems difficult. Althoughthey are intended to be objective ratings mayvary between scorers using the same scale. Dehydration (skin tent turgor/'pinch' test) Skin is pinched on the neck or shoulder. If there is a delay in the skin returning to itsnormal position upon release, the equid isconsidered dehydrated.(Rose and Pritchard et al . 2006)There is no standardised protocol for testing or interpretation. A number of sites may betested with varying results and the techniqueused is likely to vary between assessors. Heat stress Defined in a number of ways in the veterinary literature - signs include no or excessivesweating, rapid respiration and heart rate,and high rectal temperature.(Pritchard et al . 2006) The lack of a standardised definition has implications for how this is measured and limitsthe feasibility of cross-study comparisons. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd161 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014behaviour can be incorporated into a welfare assessment protocol. One obvious method to assess the ability to express normal behaviour is to consider whether or not the horse has theopportunity to display behaviours that are commonly seen inferal horse populations (Waran 1997). Behaviour can also beused to assess welfare status in a wide variety of ways byutilising the occurrence of behaviours thought to indicatepositive and negative welfare. Behavioural indicators ofpositive welfare, such as allogrooming and lying behaviour, have been used to assess welfare of densely housed andstabled horses (Ninomiya et al . 2008; Benhajali et al . 2009). Behavioural indicators of negative welfare include thepresence of stereotypies, excessive aggression, and otherbehavioural abnormalities (Mench and Mason 1997; Broomand Fraser 2007). Sleep behaviour has been used as anindicator of both positive and negative welfare in horses(Bertone 2006, 2007; Ninomiya et al . 2007, 2008), illustrating theTABLE 2: Examples of equine welfare assessment measures and their limitations applied to the Freedom from pain, injury and disease Measure Example sources Use and limitations Physical examination Includes a combination of measures (e.g. capillary refill time, blink/menace response,respiration rate) some of which are listedbelow.(Rose and Hodgson 2000) May lack the time necessary to complete a detailed physical examination and themeasures included may vary betweenpractitioners. Pain scales A scoring system designed to aid the objective evaluation of pain by rating ananimal on a predefined scale, or assigning ita category based on thepresence/absence of specific painindicators.(Taylor et al . 2002; Ashley et al . 2005)These may take the form of numerical rating scales, visual analogue scales, simpledescriptors or complex multidimensionalindices. All are subject to individualinterpretation and the indicators incorporatedare liable to vary across different scoringsystems. Lameness scales Similar to pain scales, these scoring systems are intended to help quantify andobjectively assess lameness by assigning anumerical rating or category on thedegree of lameness observed.(Taylor et al . 2002; Vin uela-Fern\u00e1ndez et al . 2011)Lameness scales may be descriptive categories of lameness grade, numerical rating scales orcontinuous visual analogue scales. Assessorsmay differ in their interpretation of the scalesand the experience of the assessors has beenshown to influence their scoring. Flexion tests Typically performed during a lameness assessment: the equid's leg is held in aflexed position for between 30 s and 3 min.The equid is immediately trotted up after thelimb is released and the degree of lamenessassessed.(Higgins and Snyder 2006; Hastie 2001)Interpretation can be challenging as many horses will show some degree of lamenessafter flexion testing. Assessors are likely to varyin the pressure applied and duration of flexion.Should not be conducted by inexperiencedassessors due to the potential risk ofcomplicating underlying injuries and inflictingunnecessary pain. Heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature Measuring the equid's vital signs at rest and seeing whether these fall in to thedocumented 'normal' ranges.(Rose and Hodgson 2000; Higgins and Snyder 2006)Typically part of a standard physical examination. These measures are moreobjective than many of the animal-basedmeasures included here and 'normal' rangesare well documented in the veterinaryliterature. Gait analysis technology Quantitative assessment of locomotion in order to detect any abnormalities, utilisinggait analysis technology.(Weishaupt et al . 2001; Taylor et al . 2002)Observational analysis is highly dependent on the expertise of the assessor. Gait analysistechnology may help to overcome this, yetthis is unlikely to be practical as part of alarger welfare assessment in the field. Dental examination Inspection of the horse's dentition and oral cavity.(Rose and Hodgson 2000) The visual inspection of the horse's teeth can be aided by external palpation and observationof the horse feeding to see if there is evidenceof quidding. May require sedation dependingon the anxiety level of the horse. Hoof testers Metal pincers used by veterinarians and farriers to apply pressure to different areas ofthe hoof to help pinpoint areas of pain.(Rose and Hodgson 2000) Often used in combination with a hoof hammer to localise regions of pain in the foot. Somehorses may respond to pressure from the hooftesters on unaffected feet. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd162 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014importance of understanding the nature of the measure being used, as well as the value of utilising a variety of behaviouraland physiological measures when assessing welfare (Broom1988). The same is also true of play behaviour; traditionallyconsidered an indicator of good welfare (Goodwin and Hughes 2005), as the expression of play behaviour has also been associated with chronic stress (Hausberger et al . 2012). Rebound behaviour, suggesting a build-up of motivation to perform a behaviour resulting from deprivation (Petherick andRushen 1997), can be measured after a period of deprivationhas ended and has been used to demonstrate that horses arehighly motivated to perform active locomotory behaviour(Freire et al . 2009; Chaplin and Gretgrix 2010), and social behaviour (Christensen et al . 2002). Consequently, it can be assumed that equids that do not have the opportunity to meetthese behavioural needs in their current management systemhave poorer welfare than those that do. Recent developments in the use of behaviour to assess equine welfare have included the study of anticipatorybehaviour as a potential welfare indicator (Van Dierendoncket al . 2010) and also whether learned helplessness exists in horses (Hall et al . 2008), and, if it does, how it can be assessed (Randle 2008). Behavioural response to human approach andinteraction has also been used as part of a welfare assessmentin working equids (Burn et al . 2010) and could similarly contribute to the welfare assessment of other equinepopulations ( Table 3 ). Freedom from fear and distress Assessment of an animal's mental state is perhaps more challenging than assessing any other aspect of welfare. Thereare, however, techniques available that can help us to gain an insight in to the subjective experiences of equids and otheranimals. Physiological measures, such as heart rate variabilityand cortisol measurement can provide information on stresslevels, although care needs to be taken in the interpretation ofthese data as cortisol and heart rate can be affected bystates of excitement and arousal, as well as by states of fearand distress (Rietmann et al . 2004; Broom and Fraser 2007). More recently, researchers have used infrared thermographyas a noninvasive tool to study animal welfare by monitoringtemperature changes in body sites (including the eyes, earsand nose) in response to aversive events (Stewart et al . 2005). This technique has been used successfully to measureresponse to short-term stressors in horses (Burton et al . 2010) and it is hoped that the methodology can be developedfurther to measure states of chronic stress (Stewart et al . 2005). Analysis of equine vocalisations has also been used as anoninvasive tool to assess subjective state. Using a standardanalysis technique (the Hidden Markov Model) to analyse therecorded vocalisations, researchers were able to differentiatebetween vocalisations made in positive and negativesituations, such as feeding time and mare-foal separation(Pond et al . 2010) ( Table 4 ). Future directions: development of equine welfare assessment protocols In this review article we have given an overview of the various techniques that can form part of an equine welfareassessment protocol and a framework around which theassessment can be constructed. However, equine welfareTABLE 3: Examples of equine welfare assessment measures and their limitations applied to the Freedoms to express normal behaviour Measure Example sources Use and limitations Time budgets Amount of time an equid spends on various activities throughout its day.(Flannigan and Stooky 2002; Pritchett et al . 2003)Requires long period of observation or video recording and subsequent review. May requiresubjective interpretation of the potentialwelfare implications. Positive/negative behaviours The occurrence of specific behaviours believed to be indicative of positive ornegative emotional states.(Ninomiya al . play, sleep, aggression, allogrooming, lying/resting behaviour. Careneeds to be taken when interpreting thesebehaviours as some are reported to reflectboth positive and negative welfare states. Rebound behaviour If an equid is prevented from performing behaviour, once it is able to do so againthat behaviour may be performed to agreater extent than before the period ofdeprivation.(Christensen et al . 2002; Freire et al . 2009)Rebound of play, locomotion, or social behaviour may reflect a build-up ofmotivation to perform the behaviour duringperiods of deprivation. Demeanour/attitude Assessment of the general appearance and attitude of the equid. May be scored on apredefined scale.(Hausberger and Muller Popescu and Diugan 2013)Typically a subjective assessment of whether the horse is alert or depressed/apatheticconducted from a distance. May becombined with assessment of reaction tohuman approach or handling (also seeavoidance behaviour). Avoidance behaviour Behaviour that the equid has learned to adopt in order to evade unwelcomeadvances.(Hausberger and Muller 2002; Pritchard and of how the to the approach/presence of the assessor. May berecorded using a simple 2014 VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2014assessment still has a great deal to learn from the assessment protocols developed and used in other species, includingproduction animals (Whay et al . 2003) and dogs (Walker et al . 2009), as well as those developed and used to assess welfarein working equine populations (Pritchard et al . 2005). The role that qualitative methods can play in veterinary research is gaining recognition (Christley and Perkins 2010;Litva et al . 2010) and the increasing use of positive welfare indicators (Yeates and Main 2008), instead of, or alongside,indicators of negative welfare, provide new avenues that maycontribute to the development of new, holistic, equine welfareassessment protocols. These are exciting times in equine welfare assessment: research interest in this area is growing and furthertechnologies and tools are being developed and validated.Protocols to assess equine welfare on a yard level (Canali et al . 2002) and at animal level (Viksten et al . 2012), are currently in development, promising a much needed resource with thepotential to bring equine welfare assessment up to the levelachieved for other domestic species.

Each method differs in thelevel of invasiveness for the horse and thesamples will need to be collected at intervalssuitable for the medium. Cortisol levels mayreflect pain, other short-/long-term stressorsand arousal, making interpretation difficult. Heart rate variability Heart rate variability describes the interval that passes in between heart beats. It is a moresensitive measure than heart rate forstudying stress in equids.(Rietmann et al . 2004; von Borell et al . 2007)Used to investigate the functioning of the autonomic nervous system.

(2013) A review of equine mucocutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Equine Vet. Educ. 25, 374-378. Dear Editors, Thank you for your excellent review article on equine mucocutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (MC-SCC) byTaylor and Haldorson (2013). It is good to see that the recently discovered role of equine papillomavirus type 2 (EcPV-2) in MC-SCCs is now being included in reviews of this disease. Asmentioned by Drs Taylor and Haldorson, evidence is steadilymounting that EcPV-2 has a causative role in development ofgenital SCCs of horses (Scase et . 2010; Lange et al . 2013). However, I would like to draw your readers' attention to SCCs of the eye and adnexa (referred to as ocular SCCs in thisletter). Drs Taylor and Haldorson state that DNA wasdetected 100% of ocular and genital and 50% each of ocular, penile and vulvovaginal swabs from healthy horses (Vanderstraeten et al . 2011).' It is very important to note that Vanderstraeten et al .'s paper was retracted by Veterinary Microbiology in 2011. Thejournal's website states, ' This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor and authors, as it was recognized that asubstantial part of the results are probably incorrect due tocontamination of the original experiment .' Drs Vanderstraeten et al . should be commended for recognising contamination and retracting their article.However, their retraction has not received the same attentionas their original article, which has been cited several times andcontinues to be cited (Lange et al . 2013). While many of their findings on EcPV-2 and genital SCCs have been corroborated by their own and others' later studies, their finding that EcPV-2is present in 100% of ocular SCCs and 50% of healthy ocularswabs have not. Currently there is limited evidence that EcPV-2 is involved in ocular SCCs. To summarise the literature to date: Scase et al . (2010) detected EcPV-2 in 0 of 12 ocular SCCs. Sykora et al . (2012) detected EcPV-2 in one of 30 healthy nictitatingmembrane swabs and in one of one ocular SCCs. Kainzbaueret al . (2012) detected EcPV-2 in one of one ocular SCCs. Knight et al . (2013) detected EcPV-2 in 0 of 75 healthynictitating membrane tissue sections. As such, EcPV-2 rarely inhabits healthy nictitating membranes and has beenreported in just 2 ocular SCCs. I feel that it is premature to attribute equine ocular SCCs to EcPV-2 based on the evidence so far. While EcPV-2 may turnout to have a role, further work will be necessary to prove this.
