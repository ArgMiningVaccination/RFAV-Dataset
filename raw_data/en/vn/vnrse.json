'Ol course. I could have left your lather hack during the Gettnlfer Flowers thing, but where would we be now?\" Mis.

It s a shame the lx*s Angeles Times would give an Inch of space to this drivel . and a crime the Mete Fork notes would re\u00ad print it. Take all the shots at the president for his sins but why bring Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea Into the fray? Cheap shots like this shouldn't get by the editorial page editor.

It Is easy to get lost debating the controversial way Oral some trray nol feel re\u00ad garding the subject of We all hold per\u00ad sonal Mews lx>th for and against numerous matters that cither attack or embrace, what we fcrl Is morally acceptable. To allow such an emotional charged battle to land on the stage of local government Is a recipe for jrolltlcal and societal upheaval. Adult entertainment tue- ijulvocallv falls Into the cate\u00ad gory of taste and choice. Like It or not. support It not. Indulge in It or not. It still bolls down to a matter of preference. Ilierc are some that feel that. In order to save society, the choice must Ire denied, the temptation removed. However, we ore too diverse of a commu\u00ad nity to homogenize everyone's personal taste. In addition, that type of a solution jrlaces our most treasured freedoms In Jeopardy. As adults. If we allow the right of choice to be taken away, we subject ourselves to a possible rejreat of the same assault on another personal freedom In the futurr. We have struggled loo hard In this country to maintain the personal freedoms that allow us to grow as tndlMduals. If you doubt that, ask anyone that has been denied their freedom, regardless of the cir\u00ad cumstance*. Frequently, we areconfronted by those who feel they know best. They plead with emotions to convince whoever they can to surrender their personal rights for the good of all-so we can all be protected. However, we must revive the pain from the jiast to remember that Just a few short decades ago. the South was a breeding ground for self anointed superiority. We must commit not to allow the revival of that old Ignorant mindset that we struggled so hard to overcome.

In this bizarre sexual revolution, I still have the grtm feeling that we are approach Ing thr guillotine phase. All killing is wrong no matter how it is done He way lying then*. In jialn, not far from tlie portal of death. His breathing was ta\u00ad ilored and Ills vital signs, those Indicators of life that we In the health earc field moni\u00ad tor so diligently, while steady: were very weak. He was only 21 years old and al\u00ad ready a runccr both rare and vicious was eating away at the very marrow of his life. He was dying and there was nothing I nor anyone else could do about It. I was Ills nurse and his ryes begged for the relief that I could provide. Just a little too much of the right drug und hr would Blip o(T Into tlie eternal sleep where there would be no more pain and no more worry. No one would ever know. It would be so easy and he was bc-gglug me for the relief that only I could give. Yet In spile of his pleas and the desire to help ease Ills suffering, I did nothing. Legally It is a violation of all civilized codes of law to take the life of another no matter what the reason. To do so with willful Intent Is called murder with pre\u00ad meditation: or In our society murder tn the first degree. It Is by far (h e * most heinous of crimes against man and is universally condemned In our society. So much so, that the penalty for such a crime Is death Itself for the perpetrator. To be sure, this was one of the overriding considerations that was weighing on my decision at the time; but as I have had time to reflect on that experience. I have found a deeper rea\u00ad soning oilier than the law or the social stigma attached to such acts, to not help him slip Into that great beyond. Using the sanctity of life us an argument runs into trouble In our society. An eye for un eye und a tootli for a tooth mentullty seems to run through us all. It would seem sometimes that we have not evolved much at ull on the social scale. I understand this thought process und I would he remiss If I did not udmit to having those same feel\u00ad ings. When I have been struck I have wanted to strike* hark. I also have come to understand, u society that holds the life of Its citizens as cheap cannon fodder, for the scrape pile of history. Is ultimately doomed to self destruction. We must stop the killing of all people: he hey sic k or well, bom or unborn, civilian or soldier, citizen or criminal. All killing Is wrong no matter how It is done or who does the deed or what the circumstances. We can try to Justify the ad by any number of excuses hut the fact remains that the death of one Individual tat the hands of another Is wrong and should not he toler\u00ad ated by any civil society. Well said, you might say. hut you live tn an Ivory lowrr and do not live In the real world with the rest of us struggling pitifullyQuest Colmnist day to day for our dally bread. Tills Is a dog eat dog world and nice guys finish last. We cannot afford to turn the other cheek, und the world Is a dangerous place. There arc people who will kill you because Its Tuesday and no other reason. We must protect ourselves from these predators. You would have us give away ull our securi\u00ad ties for a pie tn the sky Ideal. To he sure, there have been times when armed resistance was used to protect tlie sanctity of life. We have seen In tilts cen\u00ad tury where the acts of a few mad men have caused the deaths of millions. I would like to know however, where the vigilance of the world was when these people came to j rower and were busy destroying their own societies. Why did we sit by and let that happen? Why haven' t we realized that the death of one peasant Is a death that af\u00ad fects us all. We are all our brothers keepers whether we want to he or not. It Is In our own best Interest to he Interested In the health and welfare of those who live on this planet with us. By taking an active Interest In the state of others we are able to stop muss destruction and genocide before It reaches tlie proportions that history has hern al\u00ad lowed to reach tn the past centuries. It is not the Hitler' s of the world that brings us to the brink of war hut our own benign neglect. We live like ostriches with our head stuck In the sand. Wc know full well that if wc can't see tlie pain It must not exist. We look for and claim complete denlabtllty. It Is not any wonder that we are condemned to repeat the ravages of history over and over again. How do we Justify state sponsored execu\u00ad tion? We llilnk that the threat of death will stop the killing of others. Well, the murder rate Is still with us and wc still execute people because they kill people. It Is a vi\u00ad cious cycle that has continued throughout history until this day. Is our own lust for retribution the real motivation for the death penalty or do we Just want simple unswers to very complex questions? Would It not he a much more humane solution to give them life without parole Instead of death? Ostracize the of\u00adfender from society. Being round no longer fit to walk among the civilized. the offender would sit for the rest of their life and think about the deed that wax done and the con\u00ad sequences of the act. Why should we care ubout these few of us that do the ultimate crime? Why shouldn't we Just get rid of litem perma- nently? After ull. tlie nred for retribution Is served und society tins one Irss bad apple. Besides Its cheaper this way. Who wants to keep u convict on death row for his en\u00ad tire life. That Is making us the- taxpayer pay for Ills crime. We pay either way. One way. kerptng them under lock and key, we pay with our money: with the other, we pay with our soul. We are the ones who create the problems of our own realities. We can cor\u00ad rect the problems that wc fare with very little effort. All that Is required Is to realize that we are the ones In churgc. We have no excuses for our own neglect. We can con\u00ad tinue to look for the answers outside of ourselves; hut In the (Inal analysis we are the ones with blood on our hands and we cannot wash It off. For very person condemned to die for the crimes they committed; we arc responsi\u00ad ble. What the State does In our name hears our responsibility. We premeditate the death of another human bring In the most cold and calculating manner possible. We put on a show called a trial by a Jury of 12 persons, good and true. We parade witness after witness before this august body. After due deliberation the accused. If fotutd guilty. Is condemned to death; in the name of the people of tlie State In which they are tried. After which thry are taken out und a lengthy appeal process begins. Tills can sometimes last for a decade or more. If uf- ter all appeals are exhausted; the guilty person Is put to death. You could not he more cold and calculating than If you plot\u00ad ted the murder In the first place. The death of the Individual brought about by other than naturul means robs that individual of the chance to advance as a spiritual entity. It Is not mans place to say who completes their spiritual path and who doesn't. We must once and for all re\u00ad alize that there are certain natural laws that we all are responsible for and this Is one of them. Tlte old testament law says and I quote, \"Thou shall not kill.\" Notice tf you will that It says nothing about parties of the first part or are there any codicils or provisions made for any other circum\u00ad stances. This law supersedes and replaces ull others foreign or domestic, state or fed\u00ad eral. We cannot escape the undeniable fuel that when we cause the death of an Indi\u00ad vidual we cause the death of us all. Seminole Herald. Snnfotd. Florida Sunday.

Community Special students at Winter Springs By Tony Tizzlo lit:KALI) CQRRKSI' ONDENT WINTER SPRINGS - With the concept of giving every child a good education. Winter Springs High School proves that educa\u00ad tion knows no boundaries. It Is there that students with vari\u00ad ous iv j m -s o f disabilities are given a chance to not only learn hut thrive and prosper. Dlls. In turn, enables them to lead rewarding and produc\u00ad tive lives, tn fact, the Winter Springs High Schools mission statement says. \"In a technical world where boundaries are disappearing, we will strive for excellence and the acceptance of diversity.\" Guidance counselor Nancy Hugerty works with exceptional students, or ESE. Hagerty says that she Is proud of the school's state of the art facility In Winter Springs. The major part of this, says Hagerty. ts llie people who work there. \"Everyone in our school Is wonderful,\" says Hagerty. In addition to ESE. other special education arras are broken down into categories Kiii li us: EME-Edueahle Mentally Dis\u00ad abled. which assists the men\u00ad tally challenged, also referred to as the aradeiuieully limited These students Irani as every\u00ad one else, hut al a slower rate. I'M D-Trainable Disabled, where the goal Is to have these students equipped with the proper skills to help them gain employment. PM D-These are the pro\u00ad foundly mentally disabled. A side not lo ibis is dud many of these students become dis\u00ad abled due lo diving accidents, cti PI-Physically Disabled. Othct tyjies of disabilities to he heljied aie. speech and lan\u00ad guage i lasses for students with these disabilities and a class for Ihe healing Impaired, taught onee a week. Aside inini thrse definitions, one need only see these eager ynmg faces lo know that tills pro\u00ad gram Is working. lliere are srrvic es (or emo\u00ad tionally disturbed Individuals. These are olherwise average students who la-cause of an emotion.d disability have vari\u00adous Issues they are dealing with. One of the brightest faces at the school Is Amber Itolierts, a IG-year-old who has Cerebral Palsy. That does not seem to stop this sociable I Oth- grader. Amber alternates between a wheelchair and crutches. Al\u00ad though the Florida native says, 'most kids think my wheel i hair Is the c oolest thing tn the world.' one reason for her scholastic success might be due lo the laet that Amber has been mainstreaming for ten years now. Mainstreaming Is the process In which students are placed Into non-disabled classes to help them assimilate Into soci\u00ad ety. When asked how she likes being 1 1 1 these classes Amber explains, \"It helps me live a normal life and Ik* a normal teenager.\" Izist year she was one of Disney's Dreamer and Doers. Jilts award was started by die Wall Disney corjioradon for all schools, [lie Dreamers und Doers program looks for stu\u00ad dents who are confident, cou\u00ad rageous. courteous and const s- lent. Hils ac hievement Is high\u00ad lighted hy a breakfast In which the selec ted students are hon\u00ad ored. Students arc also given tick\u00ad ets to Disney World. \"That's the best part.\" Amber says. Among her other ac hievements Inc lude being named student of the month hy the Seminole County Chamber of Commerce. One reason for Amber's scholastic success might la* due to the fact that she has been main- streaming for ten years now.Tlie usually positive teenager admits. *1 don't like wlirn peo\u00ad ple stare at me (because of her disability).' Scott Pyatt. 15. Is an ex\u00ad tremely polite young man. This mentally challenged teenager Is also a weight lifter, softball player and assistant head coach. He goes to dances and Is a drummer. Scott also spoke of his best buddy. The Best Buddy program Is a national activity. Tills program pairs exceptional students with uon- dloahled students. Scott comes from a family of four children. A native of Ala\u00ad bama. his family recently moved to Winter Springs. As Important as It Is for the dis\u00ad abled student to Interact with society. It ts also Important for the average young person to know that the world Is made up of many different kinds of peo\u00ad ple. Brian Halweck. 19. has one sister. Brian enjoys bowling, football. He especially likes the Miami Dolphins. His favorite class is math. Another activity designed for Interactivity is the peer coun\u00ad selors. These non-dlsablcd students get 1/2 extra credits for work\u00ad ing with their disabled peers. Hagerty says It works out well fur both students. Pamme Davis, department chair for the ESE says 'mainstreaming works differ\u00ad ently for some students, hut every student should Ire taken separately. Inclusion for the sake of Inclusion Is wrong. JJiese kids have to (million as adults.\"\"We are very lucky to lie In this school system In Seminole County and In this district. Davis said. \"They support our needs. I have the highest re\u00ad gard for the students.\" Two of the muny people re\u00ad sponsible for (lie success of the school arc principal Wayne Epps and vice principal Karen Coleman. Another exceptional activity at the school Is the JET-Job Education and Training pro\u00ad gram. Says trachrr Linda Ellis, \"It teaches students survival skills, like cooking, money counting, telling time, etc.\" \"I have three students who are currently ut Pnhllx. Albert\u00ad sons and Tnrget.\" These stu\u00ad dents are not paid, hut ran work when they arc 18-years- old. Others are also proud of the accomplishments of Winter Springs High Schools Special Education rurrtriiluin. Paul Flnnrgan Is chairman of the Winter Springs High School Advisory Council. Of the school and staff Finnegan says, \"They ure very pro-active in every\u00ad thing. We ulso have one third of our staff CPR certified.\" Fin\u00ad negan says that number Is growing. Hugerty was also quick lo mention Ihe beautiful, sparlous surroundings of the school. Jills lends Itself lo the or\u00ad derly and polite conduct dis\u00ad played hy all of the students. Ilugrrty also pointed out the cooperative way Ihe disabled und non-disabled students get along These young people, no doubt, are Ir.uuiug that the world Is made up of many dif\u00ad ferent kinds of people.M O N S T E R D E B T9 L E T 'S K IL L I T !

I'm sitting In Busch Stadium or the Astrodome where, this weekend. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are trying to hit the most valuable baseball In the history of the game. And the ball comes toward me and It bounces and my hand gets crushed and my ck mybeer gets spilled and I grab the ball and stic It In my pocket. Dozens of security guards come after me to take me to a special presentation. And they escort me. without buying me a new beer or taking care of my broken hand, to the field where the new Home Run King Is standing there with a giant smile an his face. They walk me onto the field with thousands of photographers taking my picture. Some guy prom pts me to look Into a cam era and announce that I'm going to Disney World. v . I get closer. !\u00bb--\u00ab *-*-\u00bb\u00bb\u2014 * Let's say It's McGwire th at hits the winner. His son comes u p and gives me a big hug. McGwire bum ps me with a bum p and bone fist salute. The rest of the Cardinals are teary-eyed. The crowd Is going n u ts for me, the hum anitarian. Stan Muslal and Lou Brock shake hand. The Marls family greets me and tells their dad would have been proud of me. Fireworks are going off everywhere. Tim McCarver and Jack Buck are telling their audiences how wonderful It Is th at baseball has survtved two strikes and a million of other public relations blunders. Everything Is beautiful In Its own way. Except for one thing: I ain't glvln* him the ball. Are you crazy? The thing's worth a million bucks at least. Since the sluggers got dose. I thought It was wonderful th at everyone who ended up with the historic baseball's were turning down hundreds of thousands of dollars an a giving them back for free, or In exchange for a Jersey and a b a t But then I thought about It and realized th at those hum anitarians are stupid. Did I mention those baseballs are worth a t least a million dollars? That pays a lot of re n t It pays for weeks In Can cun and a really cool car. Now, 1 w ouldn't lust sell It to anybody. Surely there are a lot *me of n u ts willing to pay ly there for a baseball like th a t A sleazy m an in Baltimore (no nam es but 1 honestly worked for him when 1 was In high school) has Eddie M urray's 500th home ru n ball In a tacky display case In his tacky hotel lobby. Failed actor Charlie Sheen paid $05,000 so he could stick the fam ous 'B uckner ball* In his basement. No. 1 would sell It to someone who promised to donate It to the Hall of Fame, o r display it somewhere dignified. But. bottom line Is, I'm holding It until someone offers me a big bag full of money.

Two yean ago, the Seminole glrta* volleyball went undefeated In conference play and had the most successful season In the history of the school. Sitting at the far end of the bench, rarely seeing action was then-sophomore Amanda Cook. Every one of the starters from that powerhouse graduated In 1996. Cook waa left as one of the few returning players and the team struggled mightily last season. Now, It's time for a new crop of 'Notes and. with Cook leading the way. they have turned Into one of the county's surprising teams, running off five straight wins before losing to Winter Springs Thursday. Cook wasn' t surprised by the team's success this year. * 1 thought we could do well,' Cook said. *Our main problem last year waa Inexperience. It waa a rebuilding year and I knew we could be a lot better this year.* Seminole took the game seriously over the summer In an effort to return to SAC glory. Four of Ita players played dub ball, Including Cook for teams In thenow on. We expect to play our hardest and play with our hearts.* Cook learned a lot watching that 1996 team. She didn't play much, but learned a lot about teamwork. T learned ao much from them,* Cook said. Tt waa the first time I ever played on a really good team. They always cheered each other on and had better team spirit than any other team. They taught me a lot about attitude.* Cook was thrust Into a leadership role last season and said the losing was tough. She also knew the team waa young and had a chance to be ready for this Using the examples she got from the 1996 team. Cook has taken an even stronger role as a senior. She has some flaws In her game, she admits. * 1 have to be more aggressive at the net.* she said. * 1 don't fed like an Intlmldator at the n et but then I know some teams always try to Up or just miss when I'm at the net.* At 5-foot-10, Cook can intimidate, but she also takes her time to lead the rest of the ' Noles. * 1 try to keep everybody with atUtude and makeKU v < Jh-*a them Orlando Volleyball Academy.

Personally gtvr up five turnovers ' Complete only one of fifteen passes? Dial my friends is the secret that cams me the big tmeks here at The 1 fern Id. With my LOCK record at the JO mark. I am again fielding calls Irom other newspapers for toy services. Once again this season, after speaking with family and friends. 1 have decided to only pro\u00ad vide mv picks for my loyal readers here In the Herald. Circulation has skyrocketed again this season as readers seek Ihc edge against the point spread. Tills week promises to be exciting ns teams that have been doing well will look to pull away from the competition, while the hot tom-feeders attempt to tutu things around. Let s take n quick look at our teams here In Florida before we get to the schedule. lampa Hay. as predicted here In tills column, destroyed the visiting Chicago Bears after a sluggish stait. The win only moves them to 1-2. but does get them back In the Divisional race. Trailing 12-0, Dllfcr and Company Impressed me with a come from behind victory.

Marino gets hurt, team collapses. It's get\u00ad ting old. and this year I won't make the mistake oi getting excited early In the season. Ihe Jaguars look very good after their victory oxer the Ravens. Tills team could win Ihc Divi\u00ad sion and ih.it Is saying a lot, because except for the A.F.C.

Carolina wanted to compete immediately, while Jacksonville looked lor youth to build on. ll s a no-brainer who made the better drctslon. I look for this young, but matured, team to have a nice nm at. and through, the playoffs. Let's take a look at the CRYSTAL BALL OF FOOTBALL and find some winners. GREEN BAY ( 0) AT CAROLINA I look for Favre and the Packers to beat this learn thoroughly. The Panthers have looked ter\u00ad rible this year, and tilings will get worse against a very good Green Bay team. Did you know that l-iwrcnec Phillips worked out for the Packers Thursday?? Packers 31, Panthers 0. DENVER (-7) AT WASHINGTON The Broncos proved they are capable of win\u00ad ning without Elway, while Ihc Redskins have yet lo prove they can win with anybody. This one Is etched In stone. Broncos 23, Panthers 6. DALLAS (-5) VS OAKLAND The Cowgirls come off a win against an ane\u00ad mic Giants squad, while the Raiders gave the Broncos a tough time until ihe fourth quarter. I guess Dallas will win. but they don't deserve to. Cowgirls 16, Cheaters 13. KANSAS CITY (-9) AT PHILADELPHIA Rlrh Gannon gets the start T or the Chiefs while Rodney Pcete goes for Phllly. I like the Eagles and the points In this one. 1 can't remember Ihe name of their coach, but I know he's on his way out if they get blown outIn this one. Take ihc points, line your pockets, and hustle oil to the bank! Chiefii IS, Eagles 14. JACKSONVILLE (-3) AT TENNESSEE Tills game Is going to be a fight! Sticks, knives, and chains will be on the field for this one. The Oilers realize that they need to win tills game If they are going to mnaln ns con\u00ad tenders for much longer. The problem Is that Ihe Jags may Just Ire too good. Jags 23, Oilers 21. INDIANAPOLIS (-1) VS. NEW ORLEANS Mike Dltka has the Saints plnytng great, and Jim Mora has the Colts scoring about nine iwlnls per game. The only thing that will keep the Saints from un amazing 3-0 start Is If they show up at this one drunk. With the Superdome three blocks from Bour\u00ad bon Street, this Is always a concern. Salats 26, Colts 17. PITTSBURGH (-3) VS. SEATTLE 1 would love to be at (his game. Hie Stcrlers are coming ofT an embarrassing loss at Miami, nnd will look to take It out on a very talented Senbnwks squad. fills game. In my opinion, represents a poten\u00ad tial rbnnglng of the guard In the A.F.C. If Seat\u00ad tle con win this one, they will make a loud and clear statement that they are for real. If the Stcrlers lose, they need to examine their entire game plan. Tills Is the game of the week from a specta\u00ad tors point of view. TOO CLOSE TO CALL. NEW YORK GIANTS (-3) AT SAN DIEGO llow In the world can the Giants be favored on the road? Tills Is the team that lost to Oakland two weeks ngo, and the Chargers have a better defense. This game provides a possible LOCK selec\u00ad tion. take the Bolts and the points. Chargors 17, Giants B. SAN FRANCISCO (-10) VS. ATLANTA Both trains come off the bye week looking to stay undefeated. Tlie Falcons have had Ihc benefit of playing wcukrr teams, and It will catch up wtth them In tills one. The Nltiers have owned this squad athome for the last six yrare and I don't look for any surprises. Nlnore 26, Falcons 10. MINNESOTA (-6) AT CHICAGO The Bears have managed to keep games close with very little talent. Coaching nnd heart have kept this squad together, but this Is a Divisional game. 1 said In Week One that I think Chicago will only win three games this season, this won't be one or them. Vikings 24, Basra 17. BALTIMORE (-5) VS. CINCINNATI E.S.P.N.'s night game provides an interesting opportunity to see how the Bengal offense will perform against a real defense. They have put up a bunch of points, but without Sanford na\u00ad tive JefT Blake at the helm, they'll lose this one. The Ravens are the best 1-2 team in the League, but will miss the Injured Harbaugh. Defense and special teams will win this game. Ravsns 16, Bangals 10. TAMPA BAY (-1) AT DETROIT Tbny Guru loves the Dues In this one. Detroit comes back with Charlie Batch at quarterback and the Dues will be ready. Tampa needs this win to get back tn the Division race and will look to end the game early. If Sapp and Nickerson can stop Barry Sand\u00ad ers. this one will be over by hair-time. Sues 27, Lloaa 10. Today should be a great day or football and the favorltea should have another nice outing. With my LOCK record standing at an Impres\u00ad sive 3-0, I've decided to make It a little more difficult on myself. Instead of going with my first or second choice this week. I'm going with the game I feel Is the third best selection of the week. Today I'm going with Ihe PHILADELPHIA EAOLE6 (+6) OVER THE KAJVBAS CITY CHIEF* as my patented LOCK OP THE WEEK. The Eagles will come Into this game with eve\u00ad rything they' ve got and I think that will be enough to cover this line. Take the Eagles, the points, and the cash, tn this one folks, It's why I get paid the big bucks here at the Herald. Enjoy your football, and remember, everything else can wait. Taylor's emergence, Stewart season-ending injury makes Jaguar brass look brilliant JACKSONVILLE _ Two weeks ago, every\u00ad one wondered why all the hoopla. Former Florida Gator Fred Taylor signed wtth the Jacksonville Jaguars during the summer after being taken with the ninth pick In the NFL draft. At the time, the Jaguars were reeling from the loss of workhorse Nat rone Means to free agency and the Iffy play of former first-rounder James Stewart. Taylor was going to be the answer, right? The Jacksonville boo-blrds could leave Strwurt alone and pick on a new tailback. But something wacky happened to the murlwnalignrd Jacksonville running game which, except for the wild playofT nm of 1996. has brrn non-existent. First of all. a new James Stewart came to camp and fifth-round pick Tavlan Banks out of Iowa wowed cvciyone during sum\u00ad mer camp. When Banks started ripping off long runsduring pre-season and Stewart started playing up to his long-awaited expecta\u00ad tions, everyone, from the coaching staff on down, started wondering why a pick was wasted on Taylor Instead of a defensive lineman. They got their answer last week. In a dominating win over Baltimore, Stewart fumbled on his'first carry and suf\u00ad fered what is being called a sprained knee on his second. He's out for the year. Banks Is still trying to leave coach Tom Coughlin's doghouse after fumbling on his only possession In a Week 1 squeaker over Chicago. So. despite seeing a lot of pine for the first two weeks, Taylor got the call from Coughlin last Sunday and ran wild, racking up 112 yards on a soggy Alltel Stadium field. He's also earned the title of The Man In the improved Jacksonville running attack that was actually featured In a nationaltelevision pre-game show last week. It' s a far cry from the usual slug It out offense of Brunell-to-whoever. The Jaguars entered the season wtth Su\u00ad per Bowl hopes and an iffy running game, never a good combination. Now. they have the balanced offense that can take them to Miami In January, as\u00ad suming Taylor la up to the challenge. JAGUAR NOTES: The defense continues to rest, mostly due to Injuries. This Sunday the Jaguars head lo Tennessee without ends Tony Brackens and Jabbar Threats. Tackle Seth Payne Is also out. but the Jaguar# patch- work line recorded three sacks last week. Defensive tackle John Jurkovtch missed practice Wednesday to be with his wife for the birth of their second son. Defensive back Aaron Beasley was fined 65,000 by the NFL for an Illegal hit on Kansas City's Tony Gonzalez two weeks ago.

It was there that his father realized he needed to get out of his small town In order to be recognized and have a chance to play In the big leagues. So Grobbins attended the Boston Bruins' free agent training camp, he placed first out of 36 goalies who attended and was recognized by Doug Keens, the coach of the Jack\u00ad sonville Bullets. He Invited Grobbins to come to the Sun\u00ad shine Stale and play for him.

Some people ask me If I'm upset by the fact that I was really the back-up on the team and didn't play very much,* Grobbins said. * 1 am not upset by that at all. It was something that I wanted to try and I was Just happy to be a part of the team. Hits was both competi\u00ad tive and recreational for me and 1 played with a lot of great guys. We were one goal from winning the championship and 1 placed second tn the league hi save percentage and goalB against average. In all. It was a groat experience and tf I can swing It, I wouldn' t mind play\u00ad ing again.* In between the moving, newFinally, Bucs win a game TAMPA B A Y _ W owl Where did they come from? Last week, the Buccaneers looked like a real NFL team, complete with ofTenae, de\u00ad fense, special teams and a little enthusiasm. They best the Chicago Bears, 27-15. Coming back from a 15-0 deficit In the third quarter took a lot more than talent and a good play book...It took heart. The same heart that took the Buca to their first playoff game tn over to years. The same heart that won the ado\u00ad ration of fans who had previ\u00ad ously only attended games to root for the opposing team. The same heart that will no doubt cany them through the rest of the season. In a home opener, in a new stadium, Tampa Bay showed that they may be down but they were certainly not out. Last weeks game put them in a must win situation and they accomplished what many thought they couldn't...they won. Trent Dllfcr led his team to one of the most important wins of the franchise...a win that proved last year wasn't a fluke and the Buca really weren't the achmuks any\u00ad more. Next up la s big one also. One that could keep Tamps Bay aa one of the laughing stocks of the NFL or could win them the respect of an entire nation. Monday night, the Bucs take on the Detroit Lions on national television. That la a big deal. How\u00ad ever. last week the Bucca\u00ad neers showed what they areBUCS' BITS By Kellie Werner Herald Staff Writer capable of If they put their minds to tt. There is pure talent on that team. Shoot, they have had terrific draft choices for several yean and have been able to scoop some of the best young play\u00ad ers the NCAA had to offer. In addition, head coach Tony Dungy has done a very good Job with the team and seems to know what It takes to motivate hts troops. Hopefully, Detroit will be enough of a motivation on Its on and the Bucs can Improve their 1-2 record In the divi\u00ad sion. conference and league. While the Lions are going to try and stop that from happening, all markers points to the Buca taking this won to even their win- loss Tampa Li\u00ad ons lead, 22-18, In the most closely contested series of any Buca opponent. The teams split last season, with each winning on the road. The Bucs then defeated the lions. 20-10, tn the NFC wild\u00ad card game at Tampa. Fullback Mike Alstott had his first career 100-yard game against the Bears, but his penchant for fumbling Is a concern. Alstott lost hts second fumble In three games.

They've been playing year- round for two yean, for Winter Springs and lor the Orlando Volleyball Academy club team that has gone to nationals three straight yean. Naruta has only been playing volleyball since the sixth grade, but when Winter Springs opened last year and she saw the talent that the Bean had accrued, she got excited. Last year, the Bean were tough. This year? \"We were happy with our game against Berkeley,\" she said. \"When we went there, we our hearts out and left smiles on our face. W e heard they thought they killed us. but we have a shot at them later.\" This year, the team Is more experienced and, as for next year, well, Winter Springs will have everyone back from its current varsity as wrll as freshman and Junior varsity teams that are destroying eve\u00ad ryone. The Lake Mazy win was a de\u00ad fining moment for the Bean. The Roms were expected to beplayed with sithe class of the county and still have only one loss. But the win awakened a lot of people to the Idea that a second-year team can win the SAC. \"That's what really convinced us we can be a good team,\" Naruta said. It also has a lot to do with talent. \"Cortney is awesome.\" Naruta said. \"I totally respect her as a player. She's an ex\u00ad cellent player. Kris and Bev are great when they're having fun and. when that happens, they can be unstoppable.\" Amanda GlUlard. Lindsey Votrln and Katie Gridin also play major roles for the Bears. Naruta's already getting let\u00ad ters from colleges and her 3.7 grade point average should make her a popular choice for any coach, but she doesn't even think about the high ex\u00ad pectations that will await her during her senior year In high school, let alone her life after Winter Springs. This year comes first. \"This Is where we are right now and we need to keep our focus,\" Naruta said, 'it's al\u00ad ways nice to remember we have everybody back next year but we think we can go a long way this year.\"O D#wn O Interest, r u jA S n iM M la V I I O P aym ents FOR i\u00bb o DAYS on s*l*ct models # 1 / n F a s t F u n 3401 N.

Tlirough education, the group has tried to hr Ip people understand animals. They don't try to use classrooms or propa\u00ad ganda. Thr group sim\u00ad ply brings man and Ijeast together under friendly circumstances allowing them leum about one anothrr. 'It' a very beautiful thing.* said Chrlstln Hurford. who heads the foundation. *W c just bring the animals out and they teach people ulxrul caring and con\u00adservation and tolerance Iry Just being them \u00ad selves.* The foundation's main attraction Is a family of Florida pan\u00ad thers. Kesha and her cubs, Kucha and It ora. will Ik* at the Lake Mary Heathrow Festival of the Arts this year. Kucha and Itora are featured on the com\u00ad memorative poster painted by Rnr Marie in pastels on suede. As cuddly and playful us the pair look In the poster, they are In real life. They will, along w1lh their mother, be out periodically throughout each of the two days of the festival. \"People will be uble to touch them, ask rpiestlons and watch how they interact with each other and with people.\" Hurford said. When they are not on stage or available for the public, the pan\u00ad thers will still be on site for people to dew. Hurford will be on hand to tell people about panthers In thewild, about their fight against extinction and about how they inter\u00ad act with people. She said she will answer whatever questions people might huve about the animals. Thr CARE Founda\u00ad tion Is a not-for-profit organization that trtrs to educate the public alMiut how it can bene\u00ad fit from showing re\u00ad spect to animals like the panthers. They also provide a safe and permanent home for those animals which need protection in a safe environment. Many of thr animals live with Hurford In her home.

While much of what organizers and sp o n \u00ad sor- have planned i- lor the children. who have begun to have their till of looking and shopping, there will be activities for the p a r\u00ad ents who are accom \u00ad panying them. MIX 105.1. one of the corporate sponsors of the festival will have an area where the children can not only have their arlealures rendered by .i professional artist, but tltev can also ex\u00ad press themselves in media ranging from crayons to finger paints. Hu-re will be contests and activities through\u00ad out the two-dav festival geared at both the children and their p a r\u00ad ents. \"Tilts will be a great place to take a break.\" said J.C . Cam pese, promotions coordina\u00ad tor for the radio s ta \u00ad tion. \"We'll have kids' activities and a 'Parent Lounge* where adults can kick back and re- lax. have some fun and let their kids work of some excess energy.\" Campese said the MIX 105.1 area will in\u00ad artist Mandel doing free pic\u00ad tures of tlie children, who want to have their likenesses preserved for posterity.

The with 'Aunt Edna* Gather at the 1997 Lake event Is at Oval Par* for the first time.By Vicki B elluccla NKKAI.D STAFF W HITER For a decade, th r L ik e M ary H eathrow Festival of the A rts has Ijcen lire prem ier site for fine arts to Ik* cx- h lh llrd and sold In Seminole C ounty, W ith the exception o f the first year, when It took place In the tow n center area of H e a th \u00ad row. the festival has spread p a s to rla lly across the 40-acre site at IA I, Acres. T ills year. It w ill debut at a new location: Oval Park, about one m ile north of Its form er home. Oval Park, owned by Pfzzuttt. tile real estate Investm ent and devel\u00ad opment com pany w ith projects In H eathrow and th r H eathrow In \u00ad ternational B usiness Center. has newer hosted a fe stiva l, but representatives believe It Is the perfect site for the L ik e Mary H e a th \u00ad row art festival. \"It Is a wide open space w ith an oval sidewalk set around the perim eter where the a rtists can set up their booths for people to ju st w alk around and shop and enjoy,\" said M ark Evans. a spokesman for P lzzutti. T lic park Is a bit sm aller than the LAI,Acres site, but It is Ideally suited for a fes\u00ad tival like this, Evans said, because there are sidewalks and beaut I- fu lly landscaped a rra s around the areas where the a rtists w ill be set up. There w ill also be plenty of room for en\u00ad tertainm ent stages and food vendors. 'W e designed this as a festival park,\" Evans said T ills Is th r first event o f what we hope w ill be many In the park. It was designed to com plem ent the H eathrow International Business Center and Is- used as a site for all sorts of fest Ivals.\" 'Hie IA I, Acres site was owned by L 'o Tre- panler u n til recently. It was Trepanler who lent the land to the festival organizers starting In th e ir second year. T h a t place over there at H eathrow was just too sm all for what they w 'rrr doing.\" T re\u00ad panler said. \"They were going to need a bigger place, I could te ll, so I offered them my place out there.\" IA I. Acres became tb r tra d itio n a l place for the L ik e Mary H eathrow Festival of the A rts as well as a num ber of concerts and com m unity events. B ut, Trepanler said. It was the art festival that started It all.\"It was a real p le a s\u00ad ure having them out there.\" he said. \"I liked going to the festival m yself.\" Trepanler sold the site at the co m e r o f L ik e Marv Boulevard and Interstate 4 to de\u00ad velopers hallowing last year's art festival T h r once p ristin e area has l>een bulldozed and homes are being b u ilt on the acreage. The form er ow ner said he made a b u s i\u00ad ness decision In selling the property and re\u00ad grets that it w on't be available for the fe s ti\u00ad val, but be said the new site prom ises to lie a very nice one. \" 1 th in k they've got a good place over there.\" he said, adding h r In \u00ad tends to attend tills year's festival In Its new home. Because of develop\u00ad ment along the 1-4 C o r\u00ad rid o r In the H eathrow area, parking p ro b le m s that didn't exist at LAI, Acres could arise, but organizers are w o rkin g w ith the S em inole County S h e riffs O ffice and w ilh businesses In the area to accom m o\u00ad date those who w ant to attend the festival. Evans said Pizzutl w ill do w hatever It takes to make sure o r\u00ad ganizers are able to assure festival-goers that they w ill have notrouble enjoying the event. He said accom \u00ad m odations w ill be n u d e for those w ith special needs and parking as close to the festival w ill be made available for everyoneelse. \" We use to Just p a rk people there o n -s ite ,* Trepanler said. \"Now they're Just going to have to w alk a little b it to get there.\" Evans said the newfestival site Is sure to m ake the L ik e M ary H eathrow Festival of the A rts continues to be one o f the prem ier a rts events In C e n tra l F lorida..
