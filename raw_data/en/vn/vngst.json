HOW DO I USE ESSENTIAL OILS? There are hundreds of essential oils that are well known to deliver measurable health results, but some are better than others when it comes to quality. Also, some oils are better for topical applications, or even internal consumption (although directly consuming many essential oils can be toxic, so do not take essential oils internally without the assistance of a professional aromatherapist). Some oils, on the other hand, are extremely effective when spread through the air via a diffuser, inhaled in small amounts, and then spread throughout your body via the olfactory organs. This can be useful directly from the bottle on hand, or by using a diffuser.
