Diet and exercise have become like a religion, with different groups convinced that their way is the best way. We have lost our inner directive, looking outward rather than inward for advice on what is best for our bodies and our minds. Each of us is unique, and not every diet, exercise regime, or lifestyle modification is appropriate for everyone. Your physical requirements change as your internal and external environment changes. Did you climb a mountain or lie on the couch all day? Did you take an exam or relax at the beach? Have you been healthy or recovering from an illness? Did you indulge in too much alcohol last night or spend the evening doing yoga? Is it winter or spring? Are you at the beginning or end of your monthly menstrual cycle? Your requirements are constantly changing. This book is not intended to and cannot replace an in-depth, comprehensive nutritional assessment by your doctor, naturopath, clinical dietician, or nutritionist. Rather, it is intended to provide you with a deeper understanding of your constitutional type, your susceptibilities, and your basic requirements for health. One of the miracles on our planet is the diversity and variation of life. Each human being is made up of 70 trillion cells working synergistically to create a complex, functioning human being. My favorite part about being a homeopath is that I get to pay attention to the uniqueness within each individual. Every millionth of a second, our cells are regenerating, healing, repairing. The sheer beauty of this process is mind-blowing. I get to witness the homeopathic remedy gently assisting the body's vital force, its innate ability to heal. Hormones and cells communicate through networks in the body at speeds measured in a millionth of a second. It is not unusual for a sick child to fall asleep within minutes of taking a homeopathic remedy or for a person to feel subtle changes even before the homeopathic globules have even dissolved. Homeopathy has been around for over 250 years, and we have accumulated centuries' worth of recorded data and observations. The information I have gathered in this book is a culmination of what I've learned from studying the writings of many great homeopaths, responding to the enquiring minds of hundreds of students, and treating thousands of patients in over 20 years of clinical practice. What I have observed is that simple lifestyle modifications can benefit each homeopathic constitutional type, improving their healing and quality of life. This book can help deepen your understanding of constitutional homeopathic treatment and provide you with ways to take charge of your health. At the time of writing, this book is unique. There is very little written on this subject and certainly nothing else available in a patient-friendly format. This book is not complete, however, and I invite other homeopaths to share their observations and experience in this area so that together we can provide our patients with a comprehensive guide to enrich their constitutional homeopathic treatment. 480 pages Gabrielle Traub M.Tech (Hom), CCH is a board-certified classical homeopath and an international best-selling author.
