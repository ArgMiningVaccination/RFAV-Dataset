Not all chemicals are bad, but you don't need a long list of them in your hair products. One popular ingredient you've probably skipped over a bunch of times on product labels, sodium lauryl sulfate, actually strips your hair of natural oils you need, leaving you with dry, sad strands. Organic shampoos are just as strong and fortifying as their competitive counterparts. But like the rest of the beauty industry, not all non-toxic [shampoos](https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g25096473/best-shampoo-and-conditioner-reviews/) are created equal. It ain't easy being green, but we've found the best of the best completely clean options your hair will thank you later for. What does \"organic shampoo\" mean? When it comes to the products Marie Claire recommends, we take your faith in us seriously. Every product that we feature comes recommended by a MC writer or editor, or by an expert we've spoken to. [Learn more about how we review products.](https://www.marieclaire.com/how-we-test/) Organic, here in the U.S., is a distinction given to produce grown on soil that hasn't been treated with chemical fertilizers. Because shampoos are chemical compositions, definitionally, organic doesn't quite work. Instead, \"organic shampoo\" is a designation given to products that are clean and natural, formulated without chemicals deemed bad for you or the environment. Also? [Sustainable packaging](https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g33404973/plastic-free-beauty-products/) matters, too, in our shared quest to do better. Do organic shampoos work? Here's the truth: organic shampoos get a bad rap for falling short on formulations that offer a lackluster lather and a sud-less shower experience. Some of them don't make the cut, that's for sure. But fortunately, there have been many innovations in this [clean product category](https://www.marieclaire.com/home/g33406840/zero-waste-products/) with amazing [natural makeup brands](https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a25847722/best-natural-makeup-brands/) and organic shampoos that work well on all hair types and give you the [hair growth](https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g25647514/best-shampoo-for-hair-growth-reviews/), nourishment, hydration, shine, and lather you're looking for. These shampoos are free of icky ingredients and are full of rave reviews. THE GREEN JUICE FOR YOUR HAIR You know what they say about superfoods: they'll allow you to live your best life.

THE CBD SHAMPOO If slathering your strands in hemp-derived CBD doesn't sound appealing, then IDK what will. Your hair needs some R&R, too, and this shampoo will bring it back to a peaceful state using calming CBD, which has scalp-soothing benefits. There's also coconut, moringa, peppermint, and eucalpytus oil swimming around in this shampoo to stimulate hair growth. Even better: the environmentally-conscious bottles are made from plastic waste to reduce the brand's footprint. THE ELEGANT OPTION It's hard to believe that this entirely translucent formulation could deliver such a wide-array of benefits to your hair. Seaweed extract, mango, and apricot quench with plumping nutrients amino and fatty acids bring patch ragged zones. If you haven't danced with Evolvh before, the company aims to create products that work elegantly, with no nonsense, aka sulfates, parabens, silicones, pthalates, or propylene glycol.

THE HYDRATING HERO Pumpkin isn't just for spicing up your autumnal coffee choices. Organic argan oil and pumpkin rich in omega fatty acids with hydrate and nourish hair with just one wash. THE PURIST If you're trying to go plastic-free, or even just cut down on your consumption, a shampoo bar is an easy swap for your routine. This unscented option is as soothing as it is simple: babassu oil and cocoa butter hydrate strands, while sugar beet-derived betaine reduces scalp irritation. THE EVERYDAY ESSENTIAL What's cool about this coconut-derived shampoo is that it leaves behind a light lather full of nutrient-boosting bubbles that detoxify and nourish the hair with a healthy amount of hydration.

THE UNFUSSY CHOICE Coconut-derived sulfates are the hero in this minimalist celebration, which also boasts a rather addicting high-end hotel scent bouquet of grapefruit, mandarin, wood and celery seed. THE QUENCHER Drench your thirsty hair in a hydrating bath of balancing essential oils and softening emollients to smooth your hair cuticles.

THE ETHICAL OPTION For under $20, you can cop this sulfate-free and naturally/neutrally scented wunderkind, which hails from a female-owned and operated company, offering all cruelty-free and vegan products. THE PLASTIC-FREE SHAMPOO BAR According to Odacit\u00e9, approximately 552 million plastic bottles end up in landfills each year\u2014let that sink in. This plastic-free soap works just as well on its own with the help of argan oil, cupua\u00e7u butter, castor and coconut oil to thoroughly cleanse and nourish your hair. \"All the perks of your high-quality shampoo, sans the plastic pollution,\" the brand notes. Here's to shiny, soft hair that didn't involve harming the earth while in production. THE CUSTOMIZABLE OPTION The first step with the Function of Beauty range is selecting your base shampoo\u2014in this case, wavy. (Which, as someone with wavy hair, is rarely found as an option.) Next, you dip into add-ins, single-serving ampoules that can be swirled into the base to add ingredients that strengthen, lengthen, enhance shine, or protect. The result is a shampoo that's anything but one-size-fits-all. All ingredients are clean, all plastics are recycled and recyclable. THE HYDRATING BAR Just lather this obelisk between your palms, and then treat your strands to a soap-free, sulfate-free, phthalate-free, silicon-free, paraben-free, and cruelty-free adventure. Most bars last at least six months, and each arrives in a compostable paper pouch. THE LUXE + SUSTAINABLE CHOICE If you're someone who believes in the benefits of fancy shampoo\u2014I am very frugal and I am one of those people\u2014rejoice in the environmentally-friendly alternative that requires zero compromise. R+Co Bleu comes to you in packaging entirely constructed from PCR (post consumer recycled) plastic and paper, not to mention what's inside: tananu, maracuja, and argan oils for ultra hydration, plus the zippy scents of softening blood orange and primrose extracts. THE POWDER SHAMPOO Why use a powdered shampoo (not to be confused with a dry shampoo), you might wonder? The idea is that less packaging can deliver more product, and all you need to do is add water. This particular version contain milk surfactants, rice protein, and aloe vera, plus is a heck of a lot of fun. THE 5-INGREDIENT WONDER Don't let the cheeky name deceive you. Mother Dirt shampoo is clean, preservative-free, unfragranced and plant-based, but still leaves your strands squeaky clean (in a good way). Five high-powered botanicals team up for an earthy scent and a deeply effective clean.
