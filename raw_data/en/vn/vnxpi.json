April 27, 2017 14th Annual BrainDance Awards for Student Projects on Mental Illness The Institute of Living/Hartford Hospital is sponsoring an academic and art competition designed to decrease the stigma of mental illness. The BrainDance Awards encourage high school students to gain knowledge about psychiatric diseases and develop a more tolerant and realistic perspective toward people with severe psychiatric problems. The competition also aims to promote students' interest in careers in mental health care. To receive a BrainDance Award, a student must submit an academic project or an art project on themes related to severe mental illness. Awards up to $1,000 will be given to the best submissions. The projects will be judged by expert clinicians and researchers in the field, based on: Relevance to the issue of stigma Creativity Accuracy of information Scientific rigor Projects on any theme related to severe mental illness will be considered for an award. The categories are: Scientific, Creative Expression (written or visual), and Mixed Media. All applicants, their teachers, families and classmates will be invited to an awards day celebration hosted by the Institute of Living on April 27th, 2017. This day is designed to be an educational extension opportunity and will include a lecture by a national expert on mental illness, an awards presentation, a visit to our Myths, Minds & Medicine museum on the history of mental health care and a tour of our neuro-imaging research center.

[Back to top](#topics) Education, Training & Research May 13 Value-Based Oncology: Understanding & Adapting to New Paradigms in Cancer Care A Symposium for Oncology Providers, Practice Administrators, Payers, Industry and Health System Executives 7:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Connecticut Convention Center, 100 Columbus Boulevard, Hartford Value-based medicine is an essential part of any healthcare reform discussion today. As the U.S. healthcare ecosystem grapples to understand what value-based medicine means, patients, providers, hospital systems, payers and the life sciences industry will all have an increasing voice in those discussions. Because cancer care costs are among the fastest growing segment of the healthcare economy, more change is happening faster in oncology than other medical chronic diseases. As a result healthcare delivery reform in oncology will help determine a national model that will be applicable across medicine. This symposium is designed to provide critical insight into the discussions that are happening today around value-based medicine as it relates to cancer care delivery in the U.S. Program Objectives: 1. Learn about value models that reflect broader patient and societal perspectives. 2. Learn how reimbursements and payments will shift in this new healthcare landscape. 3. Understand the forces that are driving the new healthcare economy. Hartford Healthcare designates this live activity for a maximum of 4.5 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s).
