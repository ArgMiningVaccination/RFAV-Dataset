Eskenazi Health's pharmacies exclusively serve Eskenazi Health patients as condition of the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. To gain access to Eskenazi Health pharmacies, patients must provide a prescription written by an Eskenazi Health provider at an Eskenazi Health facility. Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County medical insurance plan participants may bring any prescription written from any medical provider, regardless of affiliation to Eskenazi Health, to an Eskenazi Health pharmacy. Please contact the pharmacy of your choice for more information. The pharmacy offers a robust Medication Access Program that advocates for patients by accessing drug manufacturers' free drug and co-pay assistance programs. Program coordinators are available by referral from social workers, care coordinators and pharmacy staff. As a service to the general public, anyone can dispose of unwanted, unneeded or outdated prescription medications, including controlled substances, and over-the-counter medications by placing them in the MedSafe\u00ae disposal unit located in each pharmacy. MedSafe\u00ae is a one-way system that destroys the confidential information listed on the label along with the unwanted medication in an environmentally friendly way. Depositing medications in these units decreases the chance of accidental overdose or use by other people. Value Prescriptions Listing Eskenazi Health is committed to ensuring patients have access to the right medications. The [Value Prescriptions List](https://www.eskenazihealth.edu/docs/default-source/pharmacy/value-prescription-listing.pdf) identifies medications available to all patients, both self-pay and insured, at a set, low price. A 30-day supply is available for no more than $10 and a 90-day supply for no more than $15 (insurance companies are likely to pay part or all of the charge for covered patients, so out-of-pocket costs could be even less). Medication categories featured on the list are for management of the following conditions: - Blood pressure/heart - Diabetes - Blood thinner/anti-platelet - Cholesterol - Digestion - Nutrition - Family planning - Mental health/neurology - Thyroid The list will be updated, so it's important to look at the effective dates in the lower right corner of the listing.
