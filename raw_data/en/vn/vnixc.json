Privilege to command. Command is exercised by virtue of office and the special assignment of members of the United States Armed Forces holding military grade who are eligible to exercise command. A commander is, therefore,a commissioned or WO who, by virtue of grade and assignment, exercises primary command authority over a militaryorganization or prescribed territorial area that under pertinent official directives is recognized as a \"command.\" Theprivilege to command is not limited solely by branch of Service except as indicated in chapter 2. A civilian, other thanthe President as Commander-in-Chief (or National Command Authority), may not exercise command. However, a 1 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014civilian may be designated to exercise general supervision over an Army installation or activity (for example, Dugway Proving Ground). b. Elements of command. The key elements of command are authority and responsibility. Formal authority for command is derived from the policies, procedures, and precedents presented in chapters 1 through 3. c. Characteristics of command leadership. The commander is responsible for establishing leadership climate of the unit and developing disciplined and cohesive units. This sets the parameters within which command will be exercisedand, therefore, sets the tone for social and duty relationships within the command. Commanders are also responsible forthe professional development of their Soldiers. To this end, they encourage self-study, professional development, andcontinued growth of their subordinates' military careers. (1) Commanders and other leaders committed to the professional Army ethic promote a positive environment. If leaders show loyalty to their Soldiers, the Army, and the nation, they earn the loyalty of their Soldiers. If leadersconsider their Soldiers' needs and care for their well-being, and if they demonstrate genuine concern, these leadersbuild a positive command climate. (2) Duty is obedient and disciplined performance. Soldiers with a sense of duty accomplish tasks given them, seize opportunities for self-improvement, and accept responsibility from their superiors. Soldiers, leader and led alike, worktogether to accomplish the mission rather than feed their self-interest. (3) Integrity is a way of life. Demonstrated integrity is the basis for dependable, consistent information, decision- making, and delegation of authority. (4) Professionally competent leaders will develop respect for their authority by\u2014(a) Striving to develop, maintain, and use the full range of human potential in their organization. This potential is a critical factor in ensuring that the organization is capable of accomplishing its mission. (b) Giving troops constructive information on the need for and purpose of military discipline. Articles in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) that require explanation will be presented in such a way to ensure thatSoldiers are fully aware of the controls and obligations imposed on them by virtue of their military Service (see UCMJ,Art. 137). (c) Properly training their Soldiers and ensuring that both Soldiers and equipment are in the proper state of readiness at all times. Commanders should assess the command climate periodically to analyze the human dimension of combatreadiness. Soldiers must be committed to accomplishing the mission through the unit cohesion developed as a result ofa healthy leadership climate established by the command. Leaders at all levels promote the individual readiness of theirSoldiers by developing competence and confidence in their subordinates. In addition to being mentally, physically,tactically, and technically competent, Soldiers must have confidence in themselves, their equipment, their peers, andtheir leaders. A leadership climate in which all Soldiers are treated with fairness, justice, and equity will be crucial todevelopment of this confidence within Soldiers. Commanders are responsible for developing disciplined and cohesiveunits sustained at the highest readiness level possible. (d) Requirement of Exemplary Conduct (Section 3583, Title 10, United States Code (10 USC 3583)). All command- ing officers and others in authority in the Army are required\u2014 1. To show in themselves a good example of virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination. 2. To be vigilant in inspecting the conduct of all persons who are placed under their command. 3. To guard against and suppress all dissolute and immoral practices, and to correct, according to the laws and regulations of the Army, all persons who are guilty of them. 4. To take all necessary and proper measures, under the laws, regulations, and customs of the Army. 5. To promote and safeguard the morale, the physical well-being, and the general welfare of the officers and enlisted persons under their command or charge. d. Assignment and command. Soldiers are assigned to stations or units where their services are required. The commanding officer then assigns appropriate duties. Without orders from proper authority, a Soldier may only assumecommand when eligible according to chapter 2. 1-6. Military grade and rank a. Military rank among officers of the same grade or of equivalent grade is determined by comparing dates of rank. An officer whose date of rank (DOR) is earlier than the DOR of another officer of the same or equivalent grade issenior to that officer. Grade and precedence of rank confers eligibility to exercise command or authority in the U.S.military within limits prescribed by law (see 10 USC 741). b. Grade is generally held by virtue of office or position in the Army. For example, second lieutenant (2LT), captain (CPT), sergeant first class (SFC), chief warrant officer two (CW2) are grades. Table 1-1 shows the grades in the Armyin order of their precedence. It indicates the grouping of grades into classes, pay grades, titles of address, andabbreviations. c. The pay grade is also an abbreviated numerical device with useful applications in pay management, personnel accounting, automated data organization, and other administrative fields. However, the numerical pay grade will not beused as a form of address or title in place of the proper title of address of grade. A Soldier holding the numerical paygrade of E-5 will be addressed as \"Sergeant,\" not as \"E-5\" (see table 1-1). 2 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014d. All chaplains are addressed as \"Chaplain,\" regardless of military grade or professional title.

Precedence between members of the Army and members of foreign military services serving with the Army Members of foreign military services serving with the Army have equal status with Army members of equivalent grade. When authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense, members of foreign military service serving withthe Army may exercise operational or tactical control over Army units, but they may not exercise command overSoldiers of the U.S. Army. Chapter 2 Command Policies 2-1. Chain of command a. The chain of command assists commanders at all levels to achieve their primary function of accomplishing the unit's assigned mission while caring for personnel and property in their charge. A simple and direct chain of commandfacilitates the transmittal of orders from the highest to the lowest levels in a minimum of time and with the least chanceof misinterpretation. The command channel extends upward in the same manner for matters requiring official commu-nication from subordinate to senior. b. Commanders are responsible for everything their command does or fails to do. However, commanders subdivide responsibility and authority and assign portions of both to various subordinate commanders and staff members. In thisway, a proper degree of responsibility becomes inherent in each command echelon. Commanders delegate sufficientauthority to Soldiers in the chain of command to accomplish their assigned duties, and commanders may hold theseSoldiers responsible for their actions. Commanders who assign responsibility and authority to their subordinates stillretain the overall responsibility for the actions of their commands. c. Proper use of the chain of command is vital to the overall effectiveness of the Army. Commanders must acquaint all their Soldiers with its existence and proper function. Effective communication between senior and subordinateSoldiers within the chain of command is crucial to the proper functioning of all units. Therefore, Soldiers will use thechain of command when communicating issues and problems to their leaders and commanders. 2-2. Open door policies Commanders will establish an open door policy within their commands. Soldiers are responsible to ensure that the commander is made aware of problems that affect discipline, morale, and mission effectiveness; and an open doorpolicy allows members of the command to present facts, concerns, and problems of a personal or professional nature orother issues that the Soldier has been unable to resolve. The timing, conduct, and specific procedures of the open doorpolicy are determined by the commander. They are responsible for ensuring that Soldiers are aware of the command'sopen door policy. 2-3. Performance counseling Commanders will ensure that all members of their command receive timely performance counseling. Effective performance counseling of officers, noncommissioned officers (NCO), enlisted Soldiers, and DA civilian employeeshelps to ensure that they are prepared to carry out their duties efficiently and accomplish the mission. AR 623-3 andAR 690-400 contain counseling requirements in conjunction with the evaluation reporting systems. Unit commanderswill determine the timing and specific methods used to provide guidance and direction through counseling. FM 6-22provides advice and makes suggestions concerning effective counseling. Providing regular and effective performancecounseling to all Soldiers, not just those whose performance fails to meet unit standards, is a command function. All 6 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014commanders will ensure that their subordinate commanders have implemented and are maintaining an effective performance counseling program. 2-4. Staff or technical channels Staff or technical channels may be used for sending reports, information, or instructions not involving variations from command policy and directives. 2-5. Command of installations, activities, and units a. Responsibility. The senior regularly assigned Army officer present for duty normally has responsibility for the command of units, platoon level and above, except as shown in paragraphs 2-8 a, 2-15, and 2-16. b. Command of installations. Command of Army installations is subject to policies, procedures, and regulations promulgated by HQDA. (1) Command of Army installations is exercised by a senior commander (SC). The SC is designated by senior Army leadership. The SC's command authority over the installation derives from the Chief of Staff, Army (CSA) andSecretary of the Army's (SecArmy) authority over installations. This is a direct delegation of command authority forthe installation to the SC. The SC's command authority includes all authorities inherent in command including theauthority to ensure the maintenance of good order and discipline for the installation. (2) Army installations are identified in one of two categories as follows:(a) Installations managed by Installation Management Command (IMCOM). Installations that are managed by IMCOM are discussed in paragraph 2-5 b(4)(e). (b) Installations not managed by IMCOM. Installations that are not managed by IMCOM are discussed in paragraph 2-5b(4)(f). (3) Joint bases. Army installations designated for management under Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Basing Guidance shall be operated in full compliance with DOD requirements. In the event of a discrepancy between thisregulation and the DOD policies or procedures for Joint basing, the DOD policies or procedures take precedence. (4) Roles and responsibilities. (a) Senior commander. The SC is normally, but not always, the senior general officer at the installation. The SC's mission is the care of Soldiers, Families, and Civilians, and to enable unit readiness. While the delegation of seniorcommand authority is direct from HQDA, the SC will routinely resolve installation issues with IMCOM and, asneeded, the associated ACOM, ASCC, or DRU. The SC uses the garrison as the primary organization to provideservices and resources to customers in support of accomplishing this mission. All applicable commands support the SCin the execution of SC responsibilities; therefore, the SC is the supported commander by the IMCOM region director(RD), the garrison, and tenants. The SC\u2014 1. Normally is a dual-hatted position. When this occurs the commander exercises discrete authorities as the SC and as a mission commander. The SC responsibilities and authorities are installation focused; the responsibilities andauthorities as the mission commander are mission focused. 2. Can, in rare cases, be an HQDA-appointed civilian versus a uniformed SC, who will assume the SC roles and responsibilities with the exception of UCMJ and command authority. In these instances, the individual will be referredto as the senior manager. Prior to the appointment of the senior manager, command and UCMJ authorities for theinstallation will be specified. 3. Is responsible for synchronizing and integrating Army priorities and initiatives at the installation. On IMCOM- managed installations there is a requirement for a strong collaborative relationship between the SC and the IMCOMRD. The SC commands the installation but funding of almost all installation activities flows through the RD. 4. Assumes the duties and responsibilities of the installation commander where that title is mentioned in U.S. Code or DOD or Army policies. 5. Assumes the duties and responsibilities of the senior mission commander where that title is mentioned in Army regulations except for regulations involving operational duties and responsibilities. Mission commanders will retainoperational duties and responsibilities. 6. Unless prohibited by law or regulation, the SC may delegate, as necessary, assigned duties and responsibilities to the garrison commander (GC). Such delegation shall be made in writing and specifically state the duties andresponsibilities so delegated and the termination date of the delegation. 7. Establishes installation priorities among all resident and supported units. 8. Prioritizes base operations support consistent with HQDA priorities and approved common levels of support (CLS) bands. 9. Oversees the CLS services and capabilities provided to customers. Ensures that those services are provided within the HQDA guidance, designated priorities, and approved CLS bands and coordinates with the IMCOM RD to changeHQDA-approved CLS bands to either green, amber, or red. 10. Approves and submits the installation master plan consistent with HQDA long-range plans and goals through the ACOMs, ASCCs or DRUs, and IMCOM. For IMCOM collaborates with the IMCOM RD beforethe SC submits the installation master plan. 7 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 201411. Approves the military construction, Army (MCA) and military construction, Army Reserve (MCAR) project priority list at the installation level. For IMCOM installations the SC collaborates with the IMCOM RD before the SCapproves the MCA and MCAR project priority list for the installation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers executesMCA and/or MCAR projects for the Army. 12. Reviews and approves the prioritization of Family and installation programs. For IMCOM installations the SC collaborates with the IMCOM RD before the SC approves Family and installation programs for the installation. 13. Installation force protection (FP) is as follows: (a) continental United States (CONUS) SC: as directed by U.S. Army North (USARNORTH) and in coordination with the installation management headquarters (IMCOM and Non-IMCOM), oversees FP on the installation; (b) outside continental United States (OCONUS) SC: in coordination with the ASCC and IMCOM is responsible for FP oversight on the installation. 14. Is normally designated as a General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA). The GCMCA orders will specify the appellate and review channels for SC GCMCA actions. 15. The appellate and review authority for administrative actions taken by the SC pertaining to individual Soldiers and DA Civilians will flow through ACOM, ASCC, or DRU channels unless otherwise specified in Army regulations.The terms \"next superior authority,\" and used in other Army regulations, mean ACOM, ASCC, or DRU commander or headquarters. 16. Will follow command responsibilities for the Total Army Sponsorship Program as stated in AR 600-8-8. 17. Serves as the senior Army representative to the surrounding community. 18. Senior rates the GC. (b) Garrison commander. The GC is a military officer, lieutenant colonel or colonel, selected by HQDA. The GC commands the garrison, is the SC's senior executive for installation activities, is rated by the IMCOM RD, and issenior rated by the SC. The GC is responsible for day-to-day operation and management of installations and basesupport services. The GC ensures that installation services and capabilities are provided in accordance with HQDAdirected programs, SC guidance, CLS, and IMCOM guidance. The GC provides additional service support in accord-ance with HQDA directives and provides reimbursable services in accordance with memorandum of understanding oragreement (MOU/MOA). The GC is responsible to deliver Family and installation programs, coordinates and integratesthe delivery of support from other service providers, and obtains SC approval of the installation master plan. The GCmay be appointed as a Summary Courts-Martial Convening Authority or the Special Courts-Martial conveningauthority for the installation and its support area; in rare cases the GC may be appointed as GCMCA. In some cases,the senior official on an installation may be the garrison manager. A garrison manager (the civilian equivalent of a GChas the same responsibility and authority as the military counterpart with the exception of UCMJ and commandauthority. Prior to the appointment of the garrison manager, command and UCMJ authorities for the garrison will bespecified. The GC responsibilities are as follows: 1. Represents the Army and the installation in the surrounding community as directed by the SC. 2. Approves and issues garrison policies in accordance with respective Army regulations, or installation level policies involving tenant units as directed by the SC. 3. Approves and issues policies for IMCOM civilian workforce. 4. Develops and implements the Force Protection Program. 5. Supports mobilization station requirements. (c) The Army command, Army service component, or direct reporting unit on U.S. Army Installation Command- managed installations. 1.

Provide IMCOM with subordinate mission priority requirements for MILCON and base operations. 3. Identify to IMCOM, through the CLS process and other requirements development processes, the required levels of garrison support needed to meet mission requirements. Also, identify to IMCOM any support requirements notincluded in CLS services. Collaborate with IMCOM in developing garrison support requirements that are applicable toall garrisons. 4. Evaluate the effectiveness of installation services and support and participate in the prioritization of these services and support. 5. Responsible for mobilization of subordinates as specified in AR 10-87. 6. Provide prioritization requirements for information technology and training enabler support to IMCOM. 7. Responsibilities for FP are: (a) OCONUS: The Geographic Combatant commander exercises Combatant Com- mand (Command Authority) (COCOM) authority over all aspects of FP in the AOR and delegates authority for FP asdeemed appropriate and necessary. This includes all aspects of FP on Army installations without exception; (b)CONUS: Commander, USNORTHCOM has tactical control (for FP) over all DOD personnel and assets in the AOR.USARNORTH is designated as USNORTHCOM's ASCC; the authority to execute the FP mission in CONUS isdelegated from Commander, USNORTHCOM; (1) USARNORTH has direct command and control authority overcommands when executing FP responsibilities for installations/facilities (FP reporting commands/SCs when executing 8 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014FP responsibilities for installations/facilities); (2) USARNORTH has a supported/supporting relationship with com- mands not executing responsibilities for installations/facilities (FP supporting commands). 8. Will follow command responsibilities for the Total Army Sponsorship Program as stated in AR 600-8-8. (d) Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management. ACSIM is the proponent for all Army installations and in this capacity is responsible for installation policy development and implementation Armywide. The ACSIM does notexercise command authority over Army installations. 1. ACSIM ensures that real property accountability and reporting is implemented at all installations (see AR 405-45). 2. ACSIM manages HQDA level MILCON in accordance with HQDA priorities and guidance. 3. ACSIM is the proponent for environmental policy Armywide. (e) U.S. Army Installation Management Command. The ACSIM is dual-hatted as the Commander of IMCOM. IMCOM is a DRU reporting to the ACSIM as described in AR 10-87. IMCOM manages Army installations assignedto it. IMCOM executes installation readiness missions, provides equitable services and facilities, optimizes resources,sustains the environment, and enhances the well-being of the military community. IMCOM is accountable for theefficient delivery of installation services and support. The IMCOM is responsive to ACOMs, ASCCs, and DRUsthrough a supporting to supported relationship. 1. IMCOM commands the garrisons assigned to it. 2. IMCOM and its subordinate organizations are supporting commands to the SC on IMCOM installations. There is a requirement for a strong collaborative relationship between the SC and the IMCOM RD. The SC commands theinstallation but funding of almost all installation activities flows through the RD. 3. The relationship between IMCOM and the commands of tenant organizations is analogous to the \"supporting to supported\" command relationship described in Joint Doctrine. 4. IMCOM RD rates the GC. 5. IMCOM ensures compliance with HQDA directed programs and CLS bands. IMCOM staffs and coordinates with HQDA funding requests for garrison support requirements identified by ACOM, ASCC, or DRUs that are not includedin CLS services. 6. There is a difference between command relationship in CONUS and OCONUS for IMCOM installations. These relationships are depicted in figure 2-1. 9 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Figure 2-1. Command relationships at continental United States U.S. Army Installation Management-managed installations 10 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Figure 2-1. Command relationships at outside continental United States U.S. Army Installation Management-managed installations-continued (f) Non-U.S. Army Installation Management Command installations. The SC is designated in accordance with p a r a g r a p h s 2 - 5 b ( 4 ) ( a ) a n d 2 5 b ( 4 ) ( g ) . T h e S C r o l e s a n d r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s a r e t h e s a m e a s f o r a l l o t h e r A r m y installations. 1.

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' funded installations and separate facilities not on IMCOM installations are managed in accordance with Federal law, AR 420-1, and other appropriate regulations. (g) Change of senior commander.1. Permanent change. Commanders of ACOMs (CONUS), ASCCs (CONUS and OCONUS), and DRUs permanent change of SC from HQDA (DACS-GOM) for approval by the CSA. 2. Temporary change. When temporarily absent from the installation, to include deployment, SCs may remain in 11 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014command of installations or may relinquish command and designate an acting commander after coordination with applicable ACOM, ASCC, or DRU commanders. When designating an acting commander the SC will notify seniorArmy leadership, HQ IMCOM, and affected mission commands. Designation of an acting commander shall be inaccordance with the procedures established in this regulation for appointing acting commanders. c. Uniform Code of Military Justice authority. UCMJ authority will be governed by AR 27-10. (1) Army commanders in the grade of lieutenant general or above may not assume command of Army installations, except where the installation serves as the location for an Army Corps, CONUS Army, or higher headquarters.Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the CSA and will be implemented in orders issued by HQDA(DACS-GOM). (2) Command of installations and units under the AMEDD will be as prescribed in AR 40-1.d. Announcement of assumption of command. Assumption of command will be announced in a memorandum and will contain the information shown in figure 2-2. To preclude two separate documents, appointment (applies only tothree- and four-star general officers) and assumption announcements may be included in a single memorandum, asshown in figure 2-3. Senior commander designation will be indicated on the individual's permanent change of station(PCS) orders published by GOMO. Figure 2-2. Assumption of command 12 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Figure 2-3. Appointment of commander (1) Oral assumption of command. Oral assumption of command may be used by units not using orders or other documentation to announce assumption of command or when other circumstances necessitate. Oral assumption ofcommand should be followed by a written assumption of command memorandum as expeditiously as possible. (2) Distribution. Distribution will be limited to one copy to each person concerned, subordinate commands or elements, interested commands, or agencies, and the next higher headquarters. A copy will be placed in the files of theissuing command and/or the affected command. When a general officer, or general officer designee, assumes perma-nent command, one copy will be furnished to General Officer Management Office, Chief of Staff (DACS-GOM), 200Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-0200. (3) Filing. Organizations and units governed by AR 25-400-2 will file one copy of the assumption document under organizational history files. Disposition is shown in those documents. (4) Correction and amendments. Assumption of command documents will be amended, rescinded, or revoked by publishing the correct information in another assumption of command document. The document containing thecorrection will properly identify (by date) the document being corrected, and state to whom it pertains. The amendeddocument will be distributed and filed, as appropriate. e. Optimum length of command tours. The optimum length of command tours will be based on the needs of the Army, stability within units, the need for officers with command experience, and availability of personnel. Normaloptimum command tours are as follows: (1) Active Component. (a) For company grade, 18 months with a minimum of 12 months. (b) For field grade, normal command tour length for battalion/brigade commanders is 18 to 24 months or coincides with tour length for short tour and may be as long as 36 months or more for lifecycle manned units. Commanders whohave completed 18 or more months of command as of 30 days prior to the unit's mission readiness exercise orculminating pre-deployment exercise will relinquish command. Officers who surpass 24 months because of deploymentwill relinquish command 30 to 90 days after redeployment. Extensions or curtailments will be coordinated through theofficer's ACOM, ASCC, DRU and then the Colonel Management Office (DACS-COM) for colonels or the CommandManagement Branch (CMB), HRC for lieutenant colonels. (c) This policy in paragraph 2-5 e(1)(b), does not apply to commands that have established 36 to 48 month tour lengths or to Army Acquisition Corps commands. (d) In overseas areas where the tour length precludes such tenure of command, the command tour will coincide with the overseas tour. (e) A battalion level command normally will not be held by a colonel. Accordingly, if a promotable lieutenant colonel serving as a battalion commander has a projected promotion date during the command tour, ACOM, ASCC, orDRU commanders will coordinate with HRC to schedule a change of command date as close as possible to the 13 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014projected promotion date of the officer. In cases where the change of command would adversely affect significant operational requirement, the ACOM, ASCC, or DRU commander will submit a request through the CG, HRC toHQDA for exception to policy. (2) Reserve Component. RC command tours are governed by AR 140-10. f. Command by general officers. Except as indicated in paragraph 2-8, a general officer will not be assigned without the prior approval of the Chief of Staff, Army through the General Officer Management Office, Office of the Chief ofStaff (DACS-GOM), 200 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-0200. g. Command of dental units. The senior Dental Corps officer, assigned or attached to a dental TOE unit deployed to receive and treat patients, will assume command of that unit until properly relieved. h. Command of veterinary units. The senior veterinary officer assigned or attached to a veterinary unit deployed to care for Government-owned animals, for food inspection responsibilities, and/or for civic action programs, will assumecommand of that unit until properly relieved. i. Command of Active Army training units. Army National Guard of the United States (ARNGUS) officers (when activated under 10 USC) and U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) officers, serving on active duty (AD) or active duty fortraining (ADT) under 10 USC, may be assigned as acting commanders of AA training units during annual training(AT). This includes authority under the UCMJ, unless withheld by competent authority. Senior commanders implemen-ting the authority granted by this paragraph will ensure that\u2014 (1) Paragraphs 3-1 and 3-3 are followed.(2) RCs organizations have adequately trained their commanders according to the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) and AR 27-10. (3) RC commanders receive orientation regarding the administration of military justice at the installation and the unit level. (4) Necessary attachment orders, direction of the President authority, assumption of acting command letter, adminis- trative measures, and appeal channels are accomplished. (5) Staff or command judge advocates monitor the fair and just administration of military justice.j. Active guard reserve personnel. The AGR personnel may be assigned duties (for example, serve as company commanders of AA units in USAREC) that: (1) Support operations or missions assigned in whole or in part to RCs.(2) Support operations or missions performed or to be performed by a unit composed of elements from more than one component of the same armed force; or a joint forces unit that includes one or more RC units; or a member of aRC whose RC assignment is in a position in an element of the joint forces unit. (3) Advise the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the military departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the commanders of the unified combatant command regarding RC matters. 2-6. Specialty immaterial commands The senior officer regularly assigned and present for duty with logistical commands (or communication zone headquar- ters, sections, and areas) and similar specialty immaterial commands will assume command of the organization. (Thisprovision applies unless the senior officer is ineligible under paras 2-15 or 2-16.) 2-7. Designation of junior in the same grade to command The DCS, G-1 is responsible for policy on the designation of junior in the same grade to command. a. When two or more commissioned officers of the same grade, both of whom are eligible to command, are assigned to duty in the same command or organization, the President may assign the command of forces without regardto seniority by DOR. b. General officers are authorized to announce by direction of the President, the designation of one of several officers of the same grade within a command under their jurisdiction as a commander thereof. (1) This refers to general officers commanding ACOMs, ASCCs, or DRUs, armies, corps, installations, divisions, separate brigades, regional support commands (RSCs), General Officer Commands (GOCOMs), and heads of DA staffagencies. This may be done without regard to relative seniority. (See paras 2-5 and 2-8 for policy on general officers.)When an officer who is junior by DOR is designated to command, a memorandum will be used to announce theappointment and will contain the information shown in figure 2-2. (2) This appointment is used only if the duties of the position require exercising command. It is not used to assign a junior officer to a staff position that requires supervising and controlling activities of an officer senior by DOR. In staffsupervisory positions, commanders make such appointments merely by designation in a memorandum. c. Commanders will not use the Presidential authority cited in this paragraph to appoint a junior member as their own successor, either temporarily or permanently. In some cases, a commander having authority under this paragraphmay find it necessary to place a junior member in his or her position temporarily as acting commander. If so, a requeststating the circumstances and asking for the appointment to be made will be sent to the next higher commander havingauthority under this paragraph. The next higher commander will review the request and make the appointment deemednecessary. Commanders will not issue a blanket designation without prior approval from the ACOM, ASCC, or DRU 14 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014commander, and, in cases involving general officers, coordination with General Officer Management Office, Chief of Staff (DACS-GOM), 200 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310-0200 for CSA approval. Each designation of ajunior to a command position requires a separate action by the appropriate authority except when prior approval of ablanket designation has been authorized. d. The authority in this paragraph will not be used to assign command functions to chaplains or, unless authorized by the SA or their appointee, to officers of the AMEDD except as in paragraph 2-16. e. Commanders and their staffs, at all levels of command, are responsible for ensuring proper delegation of authority to NCOs by their seniors. This policy applies whether the senior is an officer, WO, or another NCO. 2-8. Death, disability, retirement, reassignment, or absence of the commander a. Commander of Army element.(1) If a commander of an Army element, other than a commander of a headquarters and headquarters element, dies, becomes disabled, retires, is reassigned, or is temporarily absent, the senior regularly assigned Army Soldier willassume command. (2) If the commander of a headquarters and headquarters element dies, becomes disabled, retires, is reassigned, or is temporarily absent, the senior regularly assigned Army Soldier of the particular headquarters and headquarters elementwho performs duties within the element will assume command. For example, if a division headquarters and headquar-ters company commander is temporarily absent, the executive officer as the senior regularly assigned Army Soldierwho performs duties within the headquarters company would assume command and not the division commander. (3) Senior regularly assigned Army Soldier refers (in order of priority) to officers, WOs, cadets, NCOs, specialists, or privates present for duty unless they are ineligible under paragraphs 2-15 or 2-16. They assume command untilrelieved by proper authority except as provided in 2-8 c. Assumption of command under these conditions is announced per paragraph 2-5. However, the announcement will indicate assumption as acting commander unless designated aspermanent by the proper authority. It is not necessary to rescind the announcement designating an acting commander toassume duties of the commander \"during the temporary absence of the regularly assigned commander\" if the announce-ment gives the time element involved. A rescinding announcement is required if the temporary assumption ofcommand is for an indefinite period. b. Principal officials of the Headquarters, Department of the Army. On the death, disability, or temporary absence of a principal official of HQDA, the Secretary of the Army will designate an acting principal official.

Responsibility of successor A commander who succeeds to any command or duty assumes the duties of his or her predecessor. The successor will assume responsibility for all orders in force and all the public property and funds pertaining to the command. 2-13. Separate commands of the Army serving together a. When separate commands of the U.S. Army join (or perform duty) together, the senior regularly assigned U.S. Army officer present for duty with the commands concerned will command the forces unless otherwise directed by thePresident. He or she must not be ineligible under paragraph 2-15 or 2-16. b. 32 USC 317 states: \"When any part of the National Guard that is not in Federal Service participates in an encampment, maneuver, or other exercise for instruction, together with troops in Federal Services, the command of thepost, air base, or other place where it is held, and of the troops in Federal Service on duty there, remains with theofficers in Federal Service who command that place and the Federal troops on duty there, without regard to the gradeor DOR of the officers of the National Guard not in Federal Service who are temporarily participating in the exercise.\" c. When USAR units take part in ADT or AT at a post, the command of that post remains with the officers normally in command. This provision applies regardless of the grade or DOR of the officers of the USAR unit who aretemporarily taking part in training there. 2-14. Separate commands of the several military Services of the United States serving together a. When separate commands of the several military Services join (or perform duty) together, or personnel of another Service serve with the Army, operational control by an officer of one Service over the units or members of the otherServices may be given by agreement between the Services concerned, or as directed by the National CommandAuthority, by the commander of a unified command to which the separate commands are assigned, or by agreementbetween two or more commanders of unified commands to which the separate commands are assigned.

Unless otherwise directed by proper authority in the operational chain of command, the commander of the joint forces exercises operational control of the forces of each Service. This will be done through the commander of eachcomponent who will retain responsibility for such intra-service matters as administration, discipline, internal organiza-tion, and unit training. Ordinarily, an accused will not be tried by a court-martial convened by a member of a differentArmed Force unless the accused can not be delivered to their own Service without manifest injury to the ArmedForces. However, commanders of unified combatant commands may convene courts-martial over members of any ofthe Armed Forces, and commanders of joint commands or joint task forces who have authority to convene a generalcourt-martial may convene a court-martial for the trial of members of another Armed Force when specificallyempowered by the President or Secretary of Defense as a GCMCA (see MCM, Rule for Courts-Martial 201(e)). 2-15.

Chaplains. A chaplain has rank without command (see 10 USC 3581). Although chaplains may not exercise command, they have authority to exercise functions of operational supervision and control. 16 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014d. Commanding officer of troops on transports. Military personnel embarking on Military Sealift Command vessels are available for command duty unless otherwise indicated in their travel orders, or by reason of their branch ofService. General officers will be excluded from this requirement. Designation of colonels will be at the discretion ofthe terminal commander. e. U.S. Army Reserve unit commanders. The authority delegated under paragraph 2-7 will apply in the following cases when it is not practical to assign the senior officer to command: (1) When the USAR officer selected to command a USAR unit, while in Reserve duty training status, is junior in DOR to other officers of the same grade assigned to that unit (see AR 600-8-29). (2) When a USAR unit is ordered to AD, and the assigned unit commander is junior in DOR to other assigned officers of the same grade (see AR 600-8-29). f. Warrant officers. When assigned duties as station, unit, or detachment commander, WOs are vested with all power usually exercised by other commissioned officers (see DA Pam 611-21 for exceptions). g. Partially disabled officers. Partially disabled officers continued on AD under AR 635-40 will be assigned to positions in which their special qualifications make them of particular value to the Service. Such officers will not beassigned to command positions unless the assigning authority determines that the person\u2014 (1) Has the medical (physical) career potential to serve in combat situations.(2) Is able to serve until the age for mandatory retirement.h. Inspectors general. An officer detailed to duty as an Inspector General will not assume command of troops while so detailed.

Professors at the U.S. Military Academy. Officers appointed as permanent professors at the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) exercise command only in the academic departments of USMA (10 USC 4334). 2-17. Relief for cause a. When a higher ranking commander loses confidence in a subordinate commander's ability to command due to misconduct, poor judgment, the subordinate's inability to complete assigned duties, or for other similar reasons, thehigher ranking commander has the authority to relieve the subordinate commander. Relief is preceded with formalcounseling by the commander or supervisor unless such action is not deemed appropriate or practical under thecircumstances. Although any commander may temporarily suspend a subordinate from command, final action to relievean officer from any command position will not be taken until after written approval by the first general officer (toinclude one frocked to the grade of brigadier general) in the chain of command of the officer being relieved isobtained. Any action purporting to finally relieve an officer from any command position prior to the required writtenapproval will be considered for all purposes as a temporary suspension from assigned duties rather than a final relieffrom command for cause. If a general officer (to include one frocked to the grade of brigadier general) is the relievingofficial, no further approval of the relief action is required; however, AR 623-3 concerning administrative review ofrelief reports remain applicable. b. If a relief for cause is contemplated on the basis of an informal investigation under AR 15-6, the referral and comment procedures of that regulation must be followed before initiating or directing the relief. This does not precludea temporary suspension from assigned duties pending completion of the procedural safeguards contained in AR 15-6.Any action purporting to initiate or direct a relief for cause on the basis of an informal investigation under AR 15-6taken prior to completion of the procedural safeguards of AR 15-6 will be considered for all purposes as a temporarysuspension from assigned duties. 2-18. Noncommissioned officer support channel a. The NCO support channel (leadership chain) parallels and complements the chain of command. It is a channel of communication and supervision from the command sergeant major (CSM) to first sergeant (1SG) and then to otherNCOs and enlisted personnel of the units. Commanders will define responsibilities and authority of their NCOs to theirstaffs and subordinates. This NCO support channel will assist the chain of command in accomplishing the following: (1) Transmitting, instilling, and ensuring the efficacy of the professional Army ethic.(2) Planning and conducting the day-to-day unit operations within prescribed policies and directives.(3) Training of enlisted Soldiers in their MOS as well as in the basic skills and attributes of a Soldier. 17 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(4) Supervising unit physical fitness training and ensuring that unit Soldiers comply with the weight and appearance standards of AR 600-9 and AR 670-1.

(9) Administering and monitoring the Noncommissioned Officer's Development Program, and other unit training programs. (10) Achieving and maintaining courage, candor, competence, commitment, and compassion.b. The DA Pam 611-21 and FM 7-22.7 contain specific information concerning the responsibilities, command functions, and scope of NCO duties. (1) Sergeant Major of the Army. This is the senior sergeant major grade and designates the senior enlisted position of the Army. The sergeant major in this position serves as the senior enlisted adviser and consultant to the CSA. (2) Command sergeant major. This position title designates the senior NCO of the command at battalion or higher levels. They carry out policies and standards, and advises the commander on the performance, training, appearance, andconduct of enlisted Soldiers. The CSM administers the unit Noncommissioned Officer's Development Program. (3) First sergeant. The position of 1SG designates the senior NCO at company level. The 1SG of a separate company or equivalent level organization administers the unit Noncommissioned Officer's Professional DevelopmentProgram. (4) Platoon sergeant. The platoon sergeant is the key assistant and adviser to the platoon leader. In the absence of the platoon leader, the platoon sergeant leads the platoon. (5) Section, squad, and team leaders. These direct leaders are the NCOs responsible at this level. c. NCO disciplinary policies are shown below: (1) NCOs are important to maintaining discipline in the Army. The policies prescribed in this subparagraph should be considered together with the provisions of chapter 4 of this regulation, AR 27-10, and the MCM. (a) NCOs have the authority to apprehend any person subject to trial by court-martial under the MCM (UCMJ, ART. 7 and para 302(b), rules for courts-martial) and chapter 4, of this regulation. (b) NCOs may be authorized by their commanders to order enlisted Soldiers of the commanding officer's command or enlisted Soldiers subject to the authority of that commanding officer into arrest or confinement per the MCM (seepara 304(b), rules for courts-martial). (2) NCOs do not have authority to impose nonjudicial punishment on other enlisted Soldiers under the MCM (UCMJ, Art. 15). However, the commander may authorize an NCO in the grade of sergeant first class or above,provided such person is senior to the Soldier being notified, to deliver the DA Form 2627 (Record of Proceedingsunder UCMJ, Art. 15) and inform the Soldier of his or her rights. In cases of nonjudicial punishment, the recommenda-tions of NCOs should be sought and considered by the unit commanders. (3) As enlisted leaders of Soldiers, NCOs are essential to furthering the efficiency of the company, battery, or troop. This function includes preventing incidents that make it necessary to resort to trial by courts-martial or to imposenonjudicial punishment. Thus, NCOs are assistants to commanders in administering minor nonpunitive correctiveactions as found in AR 27-10 and Part V, paragraph 1g, of the MCM. \"Nonpunitive measures\" are not \"nonjudicialpunishment.\" (4) In taking corrective action with regard to subordinates, NCOs will be guided by and observe the principles listed in chapter 4. d. NCO prerogatives and privileges are shown below. NCOs will\u2014 (1) Function only in supervisory roles on work details and only as NCOs of the guard on guard duty, except when temporary personnel shortages require the NCO to actively participate in the work detail. (2) Be granted such privileges as organization and senior commanders are capable of granting and consider proper to enhance the prestige of their enlisted troop leaders 2-19. Precedence of relative grade, enlisted Soldiers Among enlisted Soldiers of the same grade in active military Service, to include retired enlisted Soldiers on AD, precedence or relative grade will be determined as follows: a. According to DOR. b. By length of active Federal Service in the Army when dates of rank are the same. c. By length of total active Federal Service when a and b are the same. d.

Chapter 3 Ready and Resilient 3-1. General The R2C guides the Army's efforts in cultivating a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to health promotion. Additional information regarding R2C and related resources may be accessed on the R2C Web site (http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/). a. R2C is a far-reaching and comprehensive initiative to enhance individual and collective resilience in order to improve readiness across the Total Army - Soldiers (Active, National Guard, and Reserve), Army Civilians, andFamily members. This initiative integrates and synchronizes the multiple Armywide efforts that are designed toimprove physical, psychological and emotional health in order to enhance individual performance and increase overallunit readiness. The R2C has the following key tasks: (1) Structure policies, systems, and processes to provide effective support to Soldiers, Army Civilians, and Family members. (2) Integrate resilience support across the spectrum of recruitment, training, development, and transition. 20 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(3) Strengthen Army Professionals and promote trust among Soldiers, leaders, Army Civilians, and the Army. (4) Communicate the campaign to leaders, Soldiers, Army Civilians, Family members, and external audiences.b. The ultimate goals for the campaign will be achieved when: (1) The Army's culture has embraced resilience as part of our profession and as a key and critical component to readiness. (2) Leaders, Soldiers, Army Civilians, and Family members consistently receive quality assistance through the coordinated efforts of the Army network of support services, thus reinforcing a command climate of trust, mutualrespect, and self-discipline. (3) Soldiers enter the Army strong and become stronger during their service, and the campaign's efforts are incorporated into the Army Campaign Plan's processes and management activities producing enduring change for theinstitution. (4) Ultimately, the Army maintains its capability to rapidly deploy and sustain ready and resilient forces to prevent conflict, shape the security environment, and win the nation's wars. 3-2. The Army ready and resilient strategic governance process At the DA level, the R2C governance process provides senior leadership with the ability to oversee execution, and identify and frame critical R2C related human dimension issues, gaps, and solutions to enhance R2C execution. Theprocess works to evaluate and strengthen the Army through a comprehensive strategy that evaluates program perform-ance through feedback and metrics that support timely decisions; identifies, synchronizes, and leverages efficiencies;and allocates the resources needed to meet the readiness demands of a dynamic and fluid operational force. Theprocess can be viewed as \"a strategic umbrella\" over individual programs and processes that have previously operatedindependently of one another. The significant components of the R2 governance process include the following: a. Ready and Resilient Campaign Senior Review Group. The Ready and Resilient Campaign Senior Review Group (R2C SRG) is responsible to the Under SecArmy and the VCSA to review actions, provide advice, and makerecommendations to Army senior leaders in support of the R2C. These actions include: integrating and coordinatingArmy programs and services; focusing education and training; transforming the Army's assessment of Soldier, ArmyCivilian, and Family fitness; and strengthening the Army Profession in order to increase resilience and improve unitreadiness. The R2C SRG will focus on improving the delivery of efficient and effective capabilities for the Total Armywhich increase and sustain resilience and unit readiness. b. Ready and Resilient General Officer Steering Committee. The Ready and Resilient Campaign General Officer Steering Committee (R2C GOSC) receives direction from and reports directly to the R2C SRG and approves majorissues for presentation to the SRG. The R2C GOSC co-chairs review tasks the Ready and Resilient Campaign Councilof Colonels (R2C COC) has recommended for closure and makes a final recommendation to the VCSA for closure.Co-chairs may elevate tasks to the VCSA for additional guidance as necessary. c. Ready and Resilient Council of Colonels. The R2C COC receives direction from and reports directly to the R2C GOSC and approves major issues for presentation to the R2C GOSC. The R2C COC reviews and recommends all closure to the R2C GOSC. The R2C COC will create new task actions as appropriate. 3-3. Responsibilities a.

Chapter 4 Military Discipline and Conduct 4-1. Military discipline a. Military discipline is founded upon self-discipline, respect for properly constituted authority, and the embracing of the professional Army ethic with its supporting individual values. Military discipline will be developed by individualand group training to create a mental attitude resulting in proper conduct and prompt obedience to lawful militaryauthority. b. While military discipline is the result of effective training, it is affected by every feature of military life. It is manifested in individuals and units by cohesion, bonding, and a spirit of teamwork; by smartness of appearance andaction; by cleanliness and maintenance of dress, equipment, and quarters; by deference to seniors and mutual respectbetween senior and subordinate personnel; by the prompt and willing execution of both the letter and the spirit of thelegal orders of their lawful commanders; and by fairness, justice, and equity for all Soldiers, regardless of race,religion, color, gender, and national origin. c. Commanders and other leaders will maintain discipline according to the policies of this chapter, applicable laws and regulations, and the orders of seniors. 4-2. Obedience to orders All persons in the military Service are required to strictly obey and promptly execute the legal orders of their lawful seniors. 4-3. Military courtesy a. Courtesy among members of the Armed Forces is vital to maintain military discipline. Respect to seniors will be extended at all times (see AR 600-25). b. The actions of military personnel will reflect respect to both the national anthem and the national colors. The courtesies listed in AR 600-25 should be rendered the national colors and national anthem at public events whether theSoldier is off or on duty, whether he or she is in or out of uniform. Intentional disrespect to the national colors ornational anthem is conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline and discredits the military Service. 4-4. Soldier conduct a. Ensuring the proper conduct of Soldiers is a function of command. Commanders and leaders in the Army, whether on or off duty or in a leave status, will\u2014 (1) Ensure all Soldiers present a neat, military appearance. 23 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(2) Take action consistent with Army regulations in any case where a Soldier's conduct violates good order and military discipline. b. On public conveyances in the absence of military police, the person in charge of the conveyance will be asked to notify the nearest military police and arrange to have them, if necessary, take custody of military personnel. In serioussituations, such as physical assault, the person in charge of the conveyance will be asked to stop at the first opportunityand request local police assistance. In all such cases, the local police will be advised to telephone (collect) the nearestArmy post or Army headquarters. c. When an offense endangering the reputation of the Army is committed elsewhere (not on a public conveyance) and military police are not available, civilian police will be requested to take appropriate action. d. When military police are not present, the senior officer, WO, or NCO present will obtain the Soldier's name, grade, social security number, organization, and station. The information and a statement of the circumstances will besent to the Soldier's commanding officer without delay. If the Soldier is turned over to the civilian police, the aboveinformation will be sent to the civilian police for transmittal to the proper military authorities. 4-5. Maintenance of order Army and Marine Corps military police, Air Force security police, and members of the Navy and Coast Guard shore patrols are authorized and directed to apprehend Armed Forces members who commit offenses punishable under theUCMJ. Officers, WOs, NCOs, and petty officers of the Armed Forces are authorized and directed to quell all quarrels,frays, and disorders among persons subject to military law and to apprehend participants. Those exercising thisauthority should do so with judgment and tact. Personnel so apprehended will be returned to the jurisdiction of theirrespective Service as soon as practical. Confinement of females will be according to AR 190-47. 4-6. Exercising military authority a. Military authority is exercised promptly, firmly, courteously and fairly. Commanders should consider administra- tive corrective measures before deciding to impose nonjudicial punishment. Trial by court-martial is ordinarilyinappropriate for minor offenses unless lesser forms of administering discipline would be ineffective (see MCM, PartV, and chap 3, AR 27-10). b. One of the most effective administrative corrective measures is extra training or instruction (including on-the-spot correction). For example, if Soldiers appear in an improper uniform, they are required to correct it immediately; if theydo not maintain their housing area properly, they must correct the deficiency in a timely manner. If Soldiers havetraining deficiencies, they will be required to take extra training or instruction in subjects directly related to theshortcoming. (1) The training, instruction, or correction given to a Soldier to correct deficiencies must be directly related to the deficiency. It must be oriented to improving the Soldier's performance in their problem area. Corrective measures maybe taken after normal duty hours. Such measures assume the nature of training or instruction, not punishment.Corrective training should continue only until the training deficiency is overcome. Authority to use it is part of theinherent powers of command. (2) Care should be taken at all levels of command to ensure that training and instruction are not used in an oppressive manner to evade the procedural safeguards applying to imposing nonjudicial punishment. Deficienciessatisfactorily corrected by means of training and instruction will not be noted in the official records of the Soldiersconcerned. 4-7. Disciplinary powers of the commanding officer a. Commanding officers exercise broad disciplinary powers in furtherance of their command responsibilities. Discre- tion, fairness, and sound judgment are essential ingredients of military justice. d. Commanders will familiarize themselves with their powers and responsibilities as outlined in MCM, AR 27-10, AR 600-37, AR 635-200, and other authorities. Legal advice is available from supporting judge advocates. c. Disciplinary measures are tailored to specific offenses and individual offenders. Commanders will neither direct subordinates to take particular disciplinary actions, nor unnecessarily restrict the disciplinary authority of subordinates(see UCMJ, Art. 37, Art. 98, and AR 27-10 regarding the proper exercise of authority by commanders). d. In accordance with AR 190-45, commanders must submit DA Form 4833 (Commander's Report of Disciplinary or Administrative Action) within 45 days of receipt of offense notification from the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO),Director of Emergency Services (DES), or U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC). Commandersmust refer to Army Law Enforcement (Military Police Investigation or Criminal Investigation Command) everycredible allegation (for example, probable cause) that an assigned Soldier committed a crime that falls outside of thecommander's investigative purview. In accordance with AR 190-45 and AR 195-2, if a commander has probable causeto believe that a Soldier assigned to his or her unit has committed a criminal offense that commander must decide theappropriate authority to handle the investigation. (1) Commanders will report disposition of offenses investigated during a command investigation or inquiry under their authority, meeting the reporting requirements of AR 195-2, when a military law enforcement activity is not 24 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014involved. Commanders must ensure there are reasonable grounds to believe an offense has been committed and that the person to be identified as the offender committed it. Referral of charges, imposition of nonjudicial punishment,approval of separation from the Service, and conviction by a civilian court are all examples of reasonable grounds.Commanders will complete a DA Form 4833 when they obtain legal review of the investigation or inquiry, anddetermine to take action against the offender about an incident. Email the completed and signed DA Form 4833 withthe supporting documents (record of commander's inquiry, Article 15, or court-martial paperwork) to the supportinginstallation PMO/DES. For commands not on an installation or commands on a Joint base, the supporting PMO/DEScan be found in AR 190-45. (2) If the offender holds a security clearance, ensure the security manager sends the completed and signed DA Form 4833 to the DOD Consolidated Adjudication Facility via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). 4-8. Settlement of local accounts on change of station To ensure organizations and individuals have properly settled their accounts, commanders will\u2014 a. Make every effort to settle local accounts of their organizations before movement. b. Take action to promptly settle organizational accounts with local firms when unable to settle before movement. c. Take action as needed when Soldiers under their command issue checks against an account with insufficient funds or fail to clear their personal accounts before departure from their stations. This includes consideration under UCMJ,Arts. 15, 121, 123a, 133, or 134. When indebtedness information is received after a Soldier departs from the stationconsult the servicing judge advocate. 4-9. Civil status of members of the Reserve component a. The RC members, not serving on AD, are not for most purposes considered officers or employees of the United States solely by reason of their Reserve status. They may accept and receive pay for employment in any civil branch ofthe public service, in addition to any pay and allowances they may be entitled to under the laws governing members ofRCs. b. A member of the RC, not serving on AD, may practice his or her civilian profession or occupation before or in connection with any department of the Federal Government unless prohibited by law. c. Conflict of interest laws impose limitations on activities in which persons may engage after terminating AD or employment by the United States. A reservist who has handled a Government matter will not, while in a civilian status,represent any party, other than the Government, in connection with the same particular matter (see 18 USC 207). Whilehandling Government matters, reservists will not take any direct or indirect action in a particular matter in which theyhave an outside financial interest (see 18 USC 208 and DOD 5500.7-R). d. Army National Guard and USAR Soldiers who are officers and employees of the United States or the District of Columbia are entitled to a leave of absence from their civilian employment when ordered under Title 39, District ofColumbia Code, to ADT or AT. This leave of absence will be granted without loss of pay, time, or efficiency rating onall days during which they are ordered to duty with troops or field exercises, or for instruction, for periods not over 15days in any calendar year. As an exception, officers and employees of the United States or of the District of Columbiawho are members of the ARNG of the District of Columbia are authorized leave for all days (no limit) on which theyare ordered under Title 39, District of Columbia Code, to duty for parades or encampment under 5 USC 6323. e. Army National Guard and USAR Soldiers may accept and be paid for civil employment with any foreign government, when approved by the SecArmy and the Secretary of State. This includes any concern controlled in wholeor in part by a foreign government. AR 600-29 is used for processing applications. 4-10. Participation in support of civilian law enforcement agencies a. Military support of civilian law enforcement is governed by the Posse Comitatus Act (18 USC 1385) and DODI 3025.21. Commanders will not sanction use of military personnel in support of civilian law enforcement agencies inthe 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or United States Territories, except whenauthorized by law. Because this is a complex area of the law, commanders and law enforcement personnel shouldconsult with their servicing judge advocate or legal advisor. b. Military personnel may report crimes or other suspicious activities to civilian police agencies or cooperate with civilian authorities in their capacities as private citizens. Military law enforcement personnel may exchange informationwith civilian authorities according to AR 190-45. 4-11. Membership campaigns The DA recognizes and benefits from the activities of many worthy organizations, associations, and clubs. Many of these organizations enjoy close, historical ties with the military community and are composed largely of active orretired military personnel. The DA support of private organizations is strictly regulated by DODI 1000.15 and DOD5500.7-R. a. In supporting such organizations and associations, post commanders and heads of DA Staff agencies will\u2014 (1) Ensure membership among personnel under their jurisdiction is truly voluntary. 25 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(2) Prohibit any practice that involves or implies compulsion, coercion, influence, or reprisal in the conduct of membership campaigns. This prohibition includes repeated orientations, meetings, or similar counseling of persons whohave chosen not to join after given a chance to do so. It also includes using membership statistics in support ofsupervisory influence. (3) Prohibit any practice that involves or implies DA sponsorship or endorsement of the organization and its activities. (4) Prohibit the use of Government property, facilities, or services, for example, golf course membership, as an inducement to join a private organization. b. This policy does not prohibit commanders from informing personnel without coercion about membership in such organizations. When doing so, commanders will ensure they do not favor one organization over others. 4-12. Extremist organizations and activities Participation in extremist organizations and activities by Army personnel is inconsistent with the responsibilities of military Service. It is the policy of the United States Army to provide EO and treatment for all Soldiers without regardto race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. Enforcement of this policy is a responsibility of command, is vitallyimportant to unit cohesion and morale, and is essential to the Army's ability to accomplish its mission. It is thecommander's responsibility to maintain good order and discipline in the unit. Every commander has the inherentauthority to take appropriate actions to accomplish this goal. This paragraph identifies prohibited actions by Soldiersinvolving extremist organizations, discusses the authority of the commander to establish other prohibitions, andestablishes that violations of prohibitions contained in this paragraph or those established by a commander may resultin prosecution under various provisions of the UCMJ. This paragraph must be used in conjunction with DODI 1325.06.DA Pam 600-15 provides guidance in implementing Army policy on extremist activities and organizations. a. Participation. Military personnel must reject participation in extremist organizations and activities. Extremist organizations and activities are ones that advocate\u2014 (1) Racial, gender, or ethnic hatred or intolerance.(2) Creating or engaging in illegal discrimination based on race, color, gender, religion, or national origin.(3) The use of force or violence or unlawful means to deprive individuals of their rights under the United States Constitution or the laws of the United States, or any State. (4) Support for terrorist organizations or objectives.(5) The use of unlawful violence or force to achieve goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature.(6) Expressing a duty to engage in violence against DOD or the United States in support of a terrorist or extremist cause. (7) Support for persons or organizations that promote or threaten the unlawful use of force or violence.(8) Encouraging military or civilian personnel to violate laws or disobey lawful orders or regulations for the purpose of disrupting military activities (subversion). (9) Participating in activities advocating or teaching the overthrow of the U.S. Government by force or violence, or seeking to alter the form of government by unconstitutional means (sedition). b. Prohibitions. Soldiers are prohibited from the following actions in support of extremist organizations or activities. Penalties for violations of these prohibitions include the full range of statutory and regulatory sanctions, both criminal(UCMJ), and administrative. (1) Participating in public demonstrations or rallies.(2) Attending a meeting or activity with the knowledge that the meeting or activity involves an extremist cause when on duty, when in uniform, when in a foreign country (whether on or off duty or in or out of uniform), when itconstitutes a breach of law and order, or when it is likely to result in violence or when in violation of off limitssanctions or commander's order. (3) Fund raising activities.(4) Recruiting or training members (including encouraging other Soldiers to join).(5) Creating, organizing, or taking a visible leadership role in such an organization or activity.(6) Distributing literature on or off a military installation, the primary purpose and content of which concerns advocacy or support of extremist causes, organizations, or activities; and it appears that the literature presents a cleardanger to the loyalty, discipline, or morale of military personnel, or the distribution would materially interfere with theaccomplishment of a military mission. (7) Receiving financial assistance from a person or organization who advocates terrorism, the unlawful use of force or violence to undermine or disrupt U.S. military operations, subversion, or sedition. (8) Browsing or visiting internet Web sites when on duty, without official sanction, that promote or advocate violence directed against the U.S. or DOD, or that promote international terrorism or terrorist themes. c. Command authority. Commanders have the authority to prohibit military personnel from engaging in or partici- pating in any other activities that the commander determines will adversely affect good order and discipline or moralewithin the command. This includes, but is not limited to, the authority to order the removal of symbols, flags, posters, 26 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014or other displays from barracks, to place areas or activities off-limits (see AR 190-24), or to order Soldiers not to participate in those activities that are contrary to good order and discipline or morale of the unit or pose a threat tohealth, safety, and security of military personnel or a military installation. d. Command options. Commander's options for dealing with a Soldier's violation of the prohibitions includes the following: (1) UCMJ action\u2014Possible violations includes the following:(a) Article 92\u2014Violation or failure to obey a lawful general order or regulation. (b) Article 116\u2014Riot or breach of peace. (c) Article 117\u2014Provoking speeches or gestures. (d) Article 134\u2014General article, specifically, conduct which is prejudicial to good order and discipline or service discrediting. (2) Involuntary separation for unsatisfactory performance or misconduct, or for conduct deemed prejudicial to good order and discipline or morale. (3) Reclassification actions or bar to reenlistment actions, as appropriate.(4) Other administrative or disciplinary action deemed appropriate by the commander, based on the specific facts and circumstances of the particular case. e. Command responsibility. Any Soldier involvement with or in an extremist organization or activity (such as membership, receipt of literature, or presence at an event) could threaten the good order and discipline of a unit. In anycase of apparent Soldier involvement with or in extremist organizations or activities, whether or not violative of theprohibitions in paragraph 4-12b, commanders must take positive actions to educate Soldiers, putting them on notice ofthe potential adverse effects that participation in violation of Army policy may have upon good order and discipline inthe unit and upon their military Service. These positive actions includes the following: (1) Educating Soldiers regarding the Army's EO policy. Commanders will advise Soldiers that extremist organiza- tions' goals are inconsistent with Army goals, beliefs, and values concerning EO. (2) Advising Soldiers that any participation in extremist organizations or activities\u2014(a) Will be taken into consideration when evaluating their overall duty performance, to include appropriate remarks on evaluation reports. (b) Will be taken into consideration when selections for positions of leadership and responsibility are made. (c) Will result in removal of security clearances, where appropriate. (d) Will result in reclassification actions or bar to reenlistment actions as appropriate. (e) May result in being reported to law enforcement authorities. (3) The commander of a military installation or other military controlled facility under the jurisdiction of the United States will prohibit any demonstration or activity on the installation or facility that could result in interference with orprevention of orderly accomplishment of the mission of the installation or facility, or present a clear danger to loyalty,discipline, or morale of the troops. Further, such commanders will deny requests for the use of military controlledfacilities by individuals or groups that engage in discriminatory practices or for activities involving such practices. f. Commanders will notify the supporting counterintelligence organization in cases where they know or suspect that Soldiers are engaging in the activities specified in paragraphs 4-12 a(3) to (9) or when they become aware of any of the activities or behaviors defined in AR 381-12. If a Soldier possesses a security clearance, commanders will ensure thesecurity manager records the derogatory information as an incident report in the JPAS (or subsequent system) inaccordance with AR 380-67. g. Participation in criminal gangs and activities by Army personnel is inconsistent with the responsibilities of military service. This subparagraph identifies prohibited actions by Soldiers involving criminal gangs, discusses theauthority of the commander to establish other prohibitions, and establishes that violations of prohibitions contained inthis paragraph or those established by a commander may result in prosecution under various provisions of the UCMJ. (1) Criminal gangs and activities are ones that advocate the planning or commission of one or more criminal offenses, by persons who share a group identity, and may share a common name, slogan, tattoos, graffiti, clothing styleor color, or other shared characteristics like the use of violence and intimidation to further its criminal objectives. (2) Participation, command authority, command options, and command responsibility are addressed above, in paragraph 4-12. (3) Soldiers are prohibited from active participation in gangs or their activities. Penalties for violations of these prohibitions include the full range of statutory and regulatory sanctions, both criminal (UCMJ), and administrative, aslisted in paragraph 4-12 d. Below are examples of active participation that are specific to criminal gangs: (a) Knowingly wearing gang colors or clothing. (b) Having tattoos or body markings associated with criminal gangs. (c) Engaging in activities in furtherance of the objective of such gangs or organizations that are detrimental to good order, discipline, or mission accomplishment is incompatible with military service. 27 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(d) Commanders should seek the advice and counsel of their legal advisor when taking actions pursuant to this policy. 4-13. Army language policy English is the operational language of the Army. Soldiers must maintain sufficient proficiency in English to perform their military duties. Their operational communications must be understood by everyone who has an official need toknow their content, and, therefore, must normally be in English. However, commanders may not require Soldiers to useEnglish unless such use is clearly necessary and proper for the performance of military functions. Accordingly,commanders may not require the use of English for personal communications that are unrelated to military functions. 4-14. Relationships between Soldiers of different grade a. The term \"officer\" used in this paragraph includes both commissioned and WOs unless otherwise stated. The term \"noncommissioned officer\" refers to a Soldier in the grade of corporal to command sergeant major/sergeant major. Theterm \"junior enlisted Soldier\" refers to a Soldier in the grade of private to specialist. The provisions of this paragraphapply to both relationships between Soldiers in the Active and Reserve Components and between Soldiers andpersonnel of other military Services. This policy is effective immediately, except where noted below, and applies toopposite-gender relationships and same-gender relationships. b. Soldiers of different grades must be cognizant that their interactions do not create an actual or clearly predictable perception of undue familiarity between an officer and an enlisted Soldier, or between an NCO and a junior-enlistedSoldier. Examples of familiarity between Soldiers that may become \"undue\" can include repeated visits to bars,nightclubs, eating establishments, or homes between an officer and an enlisted Soldier, or an NCO and a junior-enlistedSoldier, except for social gatherings, that involve an entire unit, office, or work section. All relationships betweenSoldiers of different grade are prohibited if they\u2014 (1) Compromise, or appear to compromise, the integrity of supervisory authority or the chain of command.(2) Cause actual or perceived partiality or unfairness.(3) Involve, or appear to involve, the improper use of grade or position for personal gain.(4) Are, or are perceived to be, exploitative or coercive in nature.(5) Create an actual or clearly predictable adverse impact on discipline, authority, morale, or the ability of the command to accomplish its mission. c. Certain types of personal relationships between officers and enlisted Soldiers, or NCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers, are prohibited. Prohibited relationships include the following: (1) Ongoing business relationships between officers and enlisted personnel, or NCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers. This prohibition does not apply to landlord/tenant relationships or to one-time transactions such as the sale of anautomobile or house, but does apply to borrowing or lending money, commercial solicitation, and any other type ofongoing financial or business relationship. Business relationships between NCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers that existat the time this policy becomes effective and that were authorized under previously existing rules and regulations, areexempt provided the individuals are not in the same unit or chain of command and the relationship does not meet thecriteria listed in paragraph 4-14 b(1 through 5). In the case of ARNG or U.S. Army Reserve personnel, this prohibition does not apply to relationships that exist due to their civilian occupation or employment. (2) Dating, shared living accommodations other than those directed by operational requirements, and intimate or sexual relationships between officers and enlisted personnel, or NCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers. This prohibitiondoes not apply to the following: (a) When evidence of fraternization between an officer and enlisted member or an NCO and a junior enlisted Soldier prior to their marriage exists, their marriage does not preclude appropriate command action based on the priorfraternization. Commanders have a wide range of responses available including counseling, reprimand, order to cease,reassignment, administrative action, or adverse action. Commanders must carefully consider all of the facts andcircumstances in reaching a disposition that is appropriate. Generally, the commander should take the minimum actionnecessary to ensure that the needs of good order and discipline are satisfied. (b) Situations in which a relationship that complies with this policy would move into noncompliance due to a change in status of one of the members (for instance, a case where two junior enlisted members are dating and one issubsequently commissioned or selected to be a WO, commissioned officer, or NCO). In relationships where one of theenlisted members has entered into a program intended to result in a change in his or her status from enlisted to officeror junior enlisted Soldier to NCO, the couple must terminate the relationship permanently or marry within one year ofthe date of the appointment or the change in status occurs. (c) Personal relationships between members of the National Guard or Army Reserve, when the relationship prima- rily exists due to civilian acquaintanceships, unless the individuals are on AD (other than AT), on FTNGD (other thanAT), or serving as a dual status military technician. (d) Personal relationships between members of the RA and members of the National Guard or Army Reserve when the relationship primarily exists due to civilian association and the RC member is not on AD (other than AT), onFTNGD (other than AT), or serving as a dual status military technician. 28 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(e) Prohibited relationships involving dual status military technicians, which were not prohibited under previously existing rules and regulations, are exempt until 1 March 2015. (f) Soldiers and leaders share responsibility for ensuring that these personal relationships do not interfere with good order and discipline. Commanders will ensure that personal relationships that exist between Soldiers of different gradesemanating from their civilian careers will not influence training, readiness, or personnel actions. (3) Gambling between officers and enlisted personnel, or NCOs and junior enlisted Soldiers.d. These prohibitions are not intended to preclude unit based normal team building or activity based on interaction which occurs in the context of community based, religious, or fraternal associations such as scouting, youth or adultsports leagues or teams; membership in organizations such as the Masons or Elks; religious activities including chapel,church, synagogue, mosque, or religious education; Family gatherings; unit-based social functions; or athletic events. e. All military personnel share the responsibility for maintaining professional relationships. However, in any relationship between Soldiers of different grade or rank, the senior member is generally in the best position toterminate or limit the extent of the relationship. Nevertheless, all members may be held accountable for relationshipsthat violate this policy. f. Commanders should seek to prevent inappropriate or unprofessional relationships through proper training and personal leadership. Commanders have a wide range of responses available should inappropriate relationships occur.These responses may include counseling, reprimand, order to cease, reassignment, or adverse action. Potential adverseaction may include official reprimand, adverse evaluation report(s), nonjudicial punishment, separation, bar to reenlist-ment, promotion denial, demotion, and courts martial. Commanders must carefully consider all of the facts andcircumstances in reaching a disposition that is warranted, appropriate, and fair. 4-15. Other prohibited relationships a. Trainee and Soldier relationships. Any relationship between permanent party personnel and initial entry training trainees not required by the training mission is prohibited. This prohibition applies to permanent party personnelwithout regard to the installation of assignment of the permanent party member or the trainee. b. Recruiter and recruit relationships. Any relationship between permanent party personnel assigned or attached to the U.S. Army Recruiting Command or National Guard recruiting program, and potential prospects, applicants,members of the DEP, or members of the Delayed Training Program not required by the recruiting mission isprohibited. This prohibition applies to U.S. Army Recruiting Command and National Guard recruiting personnelwithout regard to the unit of assignment of the permanent party member and the potential prospects, applicants, DEPmembers, or Delayed Training Program members. c. Training commands. Training commands (for example, TRADOC and AMEDDC) and the U.S. Army Recruiting Command are authorized to publish supplemental regulations to paragraph 4-15, which further detail proscribedconduct within their respective commands. 4-16. Fraternization Violations of paragraphs 4-14 b, 4-14 c, and 4-15 may be punished under UCMJ, Art. 92 as a violation of a lawful general regulation. 4-17. Standards of conduct Department of the Army personnel must place loyalty to country, ethical principles, and law above private gain and other personal interests. The performance of their duties should be in keeping with the highest tradition of military andcivilian service to the U.S. Government. a. Guidance. Minimum standards of conduct required of all Soldiers and Army civilians are prescribed by DOD 5500.7-R that provides Army personnel with guidance on a multitude of ethical issues, including the avoidance ofconflicts of interests between their commercial/financial interest and their official duties. b. Annual training. Commanders at all levels will ensure that all Army personnel required to file either a public or confidential financial disclosure report, contracting officers, procurement officials, and others identified by an Armyethics counselor, receive face-to-face annual ethics training as prescribed by DOD 5500.7-R. 4-18. Employment and volunteer work of spouse a. The Army affirms the rights of a spouse of a Soldier to pursue and hold a job, attend school, or perform volunteer services on or off a military installation. No DA official will, directly or indirectly, impede or otherwise interfere withthese rights. Moreover, no DA official will use the preferences and requirements of the Army or any other DODcomponent to influence the employment, educational, or volunteer service decisions of a spouse. Neither will suchdecision of a spouse, nor the marital status of the Soldier, affect, favorably or adversely, the performance evaluations,assignments, or promotion opportunities of the Soldier. (1) In discharging their responsibilities, members of military promotion, continuation, and similar personnel selec- tion boards are prohibited from considering the marital status of a Soldier, or the employment, educational, or volunteer 29 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014service activities of a Soldier's spouse. AR 135-155, AR 135-205, and AR 600-8-29 provide specific policies governing board conduct. (2) Personnel decisions, including those related to the assignments of Soldiers, will not be affected favorably or adversely, by the employment, educational, or volunteer services activities of a Soldier's spouse, or solely by reason ofa Soldier's marital status. AR 140-10, AR 614-30, AR 614-100, AR 614-200, and AR 690-700 provide specificpolicies. Exceptions may be\u2014 (a) Necessary to alleviate the personal hardship of a Soldier or spouse upon the request of the Soldier concerned, such as when a Family member requires specialized medical treatment or educational provisions or similar personalpreference accommodations. (b) Needed to facilitate the assignment of dual-military couples to the same geographic area. (c) Required by law, such as instances in which a prohibited conflict of interest may exist between the official duties of a Soldier and the employment of the Soldier's spouse. DOD 5500.7-R provides specific policies. (d) Made by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), with the concurrence of the general counsel, on a case-by-case basis, for reasons of national security, that marital status is an essential assignmentqualification for particular military billets or positions. (3) Performance appraisals on Soldiers, including officer and enlisted evaluations reports, will not contain any information regarding the employment, educational, or volunteer service activities of the Soldier's spouse, or reflectfavorably or adversely on the member based solely on the Soldier's marital status. AR 623-3 provides specific policies. b. Violations of this policy provide a basis for disciplinary action under the UCMJ in addition to appropriate administrative sanctions. 4-19. Treatment of persons The Army is a values-based organization where everyone is expected to do what is right by treating all persons as they should be treated - with dignity and respect. Hazing, bullying, and other behaviors that undermine dignity and respectare fundamentally in opposition to our values and are prohibited. This paragraph is punitive. Soldiers who violate thispolicy may be subject to punishment under the UCMJ. Whether or not certain acts specifically violate the provisions ofthis paragraph, they may be inappropriate or violate relevant civilian personnel guidance. Commanders must seek theadvice and counsel of their legal advisor when taking actions pursuant to this paragraph. a. Definition.(1) Hazing. Any conduct whereby a Servicemember or members regardless of service, rank, or position, and without proper authority, recklessly or intentionally causes a Servicemember to suffer or be exposed to any activity that iscruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning, or harmful. Soliciting or coercing another to participate in any suchactivity is also considered hazing. Hazing need not involve physical contact among or between military members oremployees; it can be verbal or psychological in nature. Likewise, it need not be committed in the physical presence ofthe victim; it may be accomplished through written or phone messages, text messages, email, social media, or any othervirtual or electronic medium. Actual or implied consent to acts of hazing does not eliminate the culpability of theperpetrator. Without outside intervention, hazing conduct typically stops at an identified end-point. (2) Bullying. Bullying is any conduct whereby a Servicemember or members, regardless of service, rank, or position, intends to exclude or reject another Servicemember through cruel, abusive, humiliating, oppressive, demeaning, orharmful behavior, which results in diminishing the other Servicemember's dignity, position, or status. Absent outsideintervention, bullying will typically continue without any identifiable end-point. Bullying may include an abuse ofauthority. Bullying tactics include, but are not limited to, making threats, spreading rumors, social isolation, andattacking someone physically, verbally, or through the use of electronic media. b. Scope.(1) What constitutes hazing and bullying? Hazing and bullying can include both physical and nonphysical interac- tions. Hazing typically involves conduct directed at new members of an organization or individuals who have recentlyachieved a career milestone. It may result from any form of initiation, \"rite of passage,\" or congratulatory act thatincludes unauthorized conduct such as: physically striking another while intending to cause, or causing, the infliction ofpain or other physical marks such as bruises, swelling, broken bones, internal injuries; piercing another's skin in anymanner; forcing or requiring the consumption of excessive amounts of food, alcohol, drugs, or other substances; orencouraging another to engage in illegal, harmful, demeaning, or unauthorized dangerous acts. Unlike hazing, bullyingoften, but not always, takes the form of excessive corrective measures that, like hazing, involve the infliction ofphysical or psychological pain and go beyond what is required for authorized corrective training. (2) Hazing and bullying are not limited to superior-subordinate relationships. They may occur between peers or, under certain circumstances, may involve actions directed towards senior personnel by those junior in rank, grade, orposition to them. Hazing may occur during graduation or promotion ceremonies or similar military \"rites of passage.\"However, it may also happen in military settings, such as in small units, to initiate or \"welcome\" a new member to theunit. Bullying may also occur in all settings but it most often appears as excessive correction of, or punishment for,perceived performance deficiencies. Hazing and bullying are prohibited in all cases, to include off-duty or \"unofficial\"celebrations or unit functions, on or off post. 30 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(3) What does not constitute hazing or bullying? (a) Hazing may occur when otherwise authorized or permissible conduct crosses the line into impermissible conduct. Bullying is always committed with the intent to exclude or reject another from inclusion in a group and, whilethe bullying conduct may appear to be corrective training, it is never authorized or permissible. The imposition ofnecessary or proper duties and the requirement of their performance does not violate this policy even though the dutiesmay be arduous, hazardous, or both. When authorized by the chain of command and/or operationally required, thefollowing activities do not constitute hazing or bullying: (1) the physical and mental hardships associated withoperations or operational training; (2) lawful punishment imposed pursuant to the UCMJ; (3) administrative correctivemeasures, including verbal reprimands and command-authorized physical exercises; (4) extra military instruction orcorrective training that is a valid exercise of military authority needed to correct a Soldier's deficient performance inaccordance with paragraph 4-6; (5) physical training and remedial physical training; and (6) other similar activities thatare authorized by the chain of command and conducted in accordance with this or another applicable regulation. (b) Many time-honored customs of the Army include traditional events that celebrate personal milestones and professional achievements. These events are part of our heritage and include hails and farewells, promotion andgraduation ceremonies, and other official command functions. When properly organized and supervised, these eventsserve to enhance morale, esprit de corps, pride, professionalism, and unit cohesiveness. The chain of command willensure these traditions and customs are carried out in accordance with Army values and that the dignity and respect ofall participants is maintained. (c) The willingness of any participant is irrelevant; therefore, express or implied consent to prohibited behaviors under this paragraph is not a defense to a violation of this regulation. c. Command responsibilities.(1) Enforcement of this policy is the responsibility of commanders and supervisors at all levels.(2) Publish and post written command policy statements on treatment of persons. Statements will be consistent with the Army policy, include the local command's commitment to prevention of hazing and bullying, and reaffirm thatthese behaviors will not be tolerated. The command policy will explain how and where to file complaints and will statethat all complainants will be protected from acts or threats of reprisal. Each ACOM, ASCC, DRU, installation, unit,agency, and activity down to company, troop, or battery level will publish a treatment of persons policy. Commandersmust consult with their legal advisor prior to publishing. (3) Conduct training. On at least an annual basis, commanders will conduct hazing and bullying training as part of the EO training requirements related to promoting a healthy unit climate. (4) Commanders will immediately report allegations of criminal behavior in violation of this paragraph to law enforcement. All other hazing or bullying allegations that are reported to a commander will be investigated as possibleviolations of Article 92 of the UCMJ in accordance with the informal board procedures set forth in AR 15-6 or as acommander's inquiry. Individuals may also report incidents of hazing to the appropriate Inspector General's office andthese incidents may be investigated by that office or referred to the command for investigation. Regardless of the typeof investigation conducted into the hazing or bullying allegation (law enforcement, IG, or administrative), commandersare responsible for coordinating with their unit Equal Opportunity Advisor (EOA) to ensure that all hazing or bullyingallegations are recorded and tracked in the Equal Opportunity Reporting System (EORS). Although administrativeinvestigations into hazing or bullying are not EO investigations, EOAs will ensure that these incidents are recorded inEORS for tracking purposes. If a Soldier possesses a security clearance, commanders will ensure the security managerrecords the derogatory information as an incident report in the JPAS (or subsequent system) in accordance with AR380-67. d. Individual responsibilities. Individuals are responsible for the following: (1) Advising the command of any incidents of hazing or bullying.(2) Conducting themselves in accordance with this paragraph and treating all persons as they should be treated - with dignity and respect. e. Individual reporting. Servicemembers should report hazing or bullying to their commander, law enforcement, or the Inspector General. 4-20. Informal funds Commanders may authorize informal funds. Examples of informal funds are office coffee, cup and flower, and annual picnic funds. These funds are subject to the following guidelines: a. Use is limited to expenses consistent with the purpose and function of the fund. b. Only one individual is to be responsible for fund custody, accounting, and documentation. Annually, this individual's supervisor is advised of the fund's financial status. c. Operation of the fund will be consistent with Army values and DOD 5500.7-R. d. Fund-raising solicitations conducted by organizations composed of civilian employees or members of the Uni- formed Services among their own members for organizational support or for the benefit of specific member welfarefunds are permitted, but they should be limited in number and scope during the official Combined Federal Campaign/ 31 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Army Emergency Relief periods in order to minimize competition with Combined Federal Campaign/Army Emergency Relief. 4-21. Misuse of Government travel charge cards Members of the Army are provided Government travel charge cards to facilitate official travel and official travel- related expenses away from the Soldier's official duty station. Individual accountability for the management of theGovernment travel charge card is vital for the continued success of the Government charge card program. TheGovernment travel card will not be used for personal, Family, or household purposes. Misuse of the Governmentcharge card is prohibited. a. Definition. Misuse of a Government charge card includes any improper or fraudulent use of a Government travel charge card, including any use at establishments or for purposes that are inconsistent with the official business of theArmy or with applicable standards of conduct. Improper use of the Government charge card is defined as using thecharge card for items or expenses that are not reimbursable as part of official travel or other official duties. b. Scope. Government charge cards are to be used in accordance with the terms of the application agreement for the Government travel charge card. c. Command responsibilities. Enforcement of this policy is a responsibility of commanders at all levels. Command- ers will ensure that all Soldiers issued Government travel charge cards are properly counseled on the appropriate use ofthe charge card. The best way to curtail charge card misuse is to prevent it through proper selection of cardholders,training, and leadership by example. Commanders will further monitor use of the Government travel charge card todetect abuse and take appropriate corrective or disciplinary action. d. Command options. This paragraph is punitive with regards to Soldiers. Violators of this policy may be subject to UCMJ, ART. 92 (Failure to obey a lawful general order or regulation), UCMJ, Art. 133 (Conduct unbecoming anofficer and a gentleman), and UCMJ, Art. 134 (Debt, dishonorably failing to pay). Commanders should seek the adviceand counsel of their legal advisor when taking actions pursuant to this paragraph. e. Official travel related expenses. While these cards will be used only for reimbursable expenses associated with official travel, the following (while not reimbursable) are considered to be related to official travel. Therefore, thetravel card may be used for the following purposes: (1) Incidental expenses. The cardholder, while in a travel status, may use the card for non-reimbursable incidental travel expenses, such as rental movies, personal telephone calls, exercise fees, and beverages, when these charges arepart of a room billing or meal and are reasonable. (2) Expenses incurred during leave in conjunction with temporary duty. The travel card also may be used for personal lodging or car rental charges, incurred in conjunction with otherwise authorized official travel expenses, whensuch charges are an integral part of the billing for the period spent at the TDY location while on official travel (forexample, when a traveler spends a weekend or authorized leave at a TDY location before or after TDY, and a room orcar rental is continued into TDY, a weekend, or a period of authorized leave). (3) Payments. The traveler will pay for incidental non-reimbursable personal expenses as part of the normal billing process. 4-22. Domestic Violence Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968 a. General. The Domestic Violence Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968 (Section 922, Title 18, United States Code (18 USC 922)), the Lautenberg Amendment, makes it unlawful for any person to transfer, issue, sell orotherwise dispose of firearms or ammunition to any person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believehas been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.

By DOD policy, a state or Federalconviction for a felony crime of domestic violence adjudged on or after 27 November 2002, will be considered aqualifying conviction for purposes of this regulation and will be subject to all the restrictions and prohibitions of thisregulation. A person will not be considered to have a qualifying conviction unless the convicted offender was 32 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014represented by counsel or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel, and, if entitled to have the case tried by a jury, the case was actually tried by a jury, or the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have thecase tried by a jury; and, the conviction has not been expunged or set aside, or the convicted offender has not beenpardoned for the offense, or had civil rights restored; unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rightsprovides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms. (3) Security clearance. If a completed security clearance investigation reveals that a Soldier has a qualifying conviction, then the investigation will be referred to the Soldier's chain of command for appropriate action consistentwith this regulation. (4) Commander. (a) Unless otherwise stated, the senior mission commander is as delineated in General Order No. 4 (2002), ACSIM. Delegation of authority is authorized.

(3) The commander will notify Soldiers that they have an affirmative, continuing obligation to inform commanders or supervisors if they have, or later obtain, a qualifying conviction and that the revised DD Form 2760 (Qualification toPossess Firearms or Ammunition) will be made available to those Soldiers who come forward to report a qualifyingconviction in compliance with their obligation to do so. Soldiers will also be notified that neither the information norevidence gained by filling out the DD Form 2760 may be used against them in any criminal prosecutions for aviolation of 18 USC 922, including prosecutions under the UCMJ, based on a violation of 18 USC 922 for conduct thatoccurred prior to the completion of the DD Form 2760. Company and battery-level commanders will collect completedDD Form 2760 and file it in the Soldier's local military personnel file in accordance with AR 600-8-104 and AR25-400-2. (4) The commander will ensure that policy and procedures are in place to enforce the provisions of this chapter if privately owned firearms or ammunition are permitted in Government quarters.

This procedure should include regular coordination with local law enforcement and judicialagencies. (6) If a commander knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a Soldier has a qualifying conviction, then the commander should take all reasonable action to investigate. Soldiers with qualifying convictions must be identified andreported to HQDA to ensure compliance with the law. A commander at any level may initiate the investigation byordering the Soldier to complete DD Form 2760. Soldiers who have or may have a qualifying conviction should bereferred to a legal assistance attorney. A legal assistance attorney will also be available to assist the Soldier in seekingexpungement of a qualifying conviction or a pardon. (7) If a commander knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a Soldier has a qualifying conviction, then he or she will immediately retrieve all Government-issued firearms and ammunition and advise the Soldier to consult with alegal assistance attorney for guidance on lawful disposal or sale of any privately owned firearms and ammunition.Individuals with qualifying convictions are exempt from weapons qualification in accordance with AR 350-1 and willnot be assigned individual weapons or ammunition. (8) Accommodation: Domestic violence is incompatible with Army values and will not be tolerated or condoned. However, Soldiers will be given a reasonable time to seek expungement of or to obtain a pardon for a qualifyingconviction and may extend up to one year for that purpose. The following factors will be considered in thecommander's determination: (a) Whether the Soldier attempted to conceal his conviction. In no event will Soldiers be accommodated who have made false statements on the DD Form 2760. (b) Whether firearms or deadly weapons were used in the offense that formed the basis for the Soldier's domestic violence conviction. (c) Whether the conviction is recent or remote in time.

Coordination will be accomplished with the Assistant Secretary of the Army (FinancialManagement and Comptroller) on matters pertaining to the budget. See AR 1-20 for additional guidance. 5-3. Political activities The DCS, G-1 is responsible for policy on Soldier participation in political activities, as contained in 10 USC 973 and DODD 1344.10 as follows: a. Obligations as a citizen. Soldiers are expected to carry out their obligations as citizens. However, while on AD, Soldiers (including full-time National Guard) are prohibited in certain cases from engaging in certain politicalactivities. The following principles apply: (1) A Soldier on AD may\u2014(a) Register, vote, and express their personal opinion on political candidates and issues, but not as a representative of the Army. (b) Make monetary contributions to a political organization. (c) Attend partisan and nonpartisan political meetings or rallies as a spectator when not in uniform.

Candidate for elective office. A member on AD may not\u2014 (1) Campaign as a nominee, or as a candidate for nomination for civil office, except as authorized in this chapter. When circumstances warrant, the senior commander (or GCMCA) may permit the Soldier to file such evidence ofnomination or candidacy for nomination, as may be required by law. Such permission will not authorize activity whileon AD that is otherwise prohibited by this regulation, DODD, or Federal statutes. (2) Become a candidate for any civil office while serving an initial tour of EAD or a tour of EAD that the member agreed to perform as a condition of receiving schooling or other training wholly or partly at U.S. Government expense. d. Election or appointment to civil office.(1) Except as authorized by this chapter, or otherwise provided for by law, no member on AD may hold or exercise the function of civil offices\u2014 (a) In the U.S. Government that is an elective office, requires an appointment by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, or is a position on the executive schedule under 5 USC 5312-5 USC 5317). (b) In the Government of a state; the District of Columbia; a territory, possession, or commonwealth of the United States; or in any political subdivision thereof. (2) A member may hold or exercise the function of a civil office in the U.S. Government that is not described in this chapter when assigned or detailed to such office or to perform such functions. (3) As long as they are not serving on EAD, enlisted members and Reserve officers may hold partisan and nonpartisan civil office if such office is held in a private capacity and does not interfere with the performance ofmilitary duties. Additionally, enlisted members on EAD may seek and hold nonpartisan civil office as a notary publicor member of a school board, neighborhood planning commission, or similar local agent, as long as such office is heldin a private capacity and does not interfere with the performance of military duties. (4) A Soldier on AD may serve as a regular or reserve civilian law enforcement officer or as a member of a civilian fire or rescue squad. Such service will be in a private capacity, will not involve the exercise of military authority, andwill not interfere with the performance of military duties. (5) A Soldier elected or appointed to a prohibited civil office may request retirement and will be retired if eligible for retirement. If the Soldier does not request or is not eligible for retirement, the Soldier will be discharged or releasedfrom AD, as determined by the SA. (6) The separation and retirement requirements above, do not apply if the member declines to serve in the prohibited office; if the SA determines that the member should not be released from AD based on the needs of the Army; or if themember is\u2014 (a) Obligated to fulfill an AD service commitment.

(8) No actions undertaken by a Soldier in carrying out assigned military duties will be invalidated solely by virtue of the Soldier having violated the provisions of this chapter. 5-4. Command aspects of medical care a. Necessary medical care. A Soldier on AD or ADT will usually be required to submit to medical care considered necessary to preserve his or her life, alleviate undue suffering, or protect or maintain the health of others. Commandersmay order the examination of any Soldier in their command when warranted. The medical treatment facility (MTF)commander will determine if hospitalization of the Soldier is appropriate. b. Mental health evaluation requirements. When a commander determines it is necessary to refer a Soldier for a 37 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014mental health evaluation, the commander will ensure compliance with the provisions of DODI 6490.01, which limits the use of mental health evaluations in situations where adversarial actions are involved. c. Medical care with or without the Soldier's permission.(1) Emergency medical care. Emergency medical care required to save the life, health, or fitness for duty of the Soldier may be performed. This is determined by the attending physician. If the Soldier should refuse treatmentrequired, and the unit commander is not available, the hospital commander may order the treatment given. (2) Immunizations. Commanders will ensure that Soldiers are continually educated concerning the intent and rationale behind both routine and theater-specific or threat-specific military immunization standards. Immunizationsrequired by AR 40-562 or other legal directive may be given involuntarily (except as prescribed in para 5-6 of thisregulation). The intent of this authorization is to protect the health and overall effectiveness of the command, as well asthe health of the individual Soldier. In cases where involuntary immunization is being considered, the followingprocedures and limitations apply: (a) Under normal circumstances, actions will not be taken to involuntarily immunize Soldiers. If a Soldier declines to be immunized the commander will\u2014 1. Ensure that the Soldier understands the purpose of the vaccine. 2. Ensure that the Soldier has been advised of the possibility that the disease may be naturally present in a possible area of operation or may be used as a biological weapon against the United States and its allies. 3. Ensure that the Servicemember is educated about the vaccine and has been able to discuss any objections with medical authorities. 4. Counsel the Soldier, in writing, that he or she is legally required to be immunized; that if the Soldier continues to refuse to be immunized that he or she will be legally ordered to do so, and that failure to obey the order may result inUCMJ and/or administrative action for failure to obey a lawful order (UCMJ, Art. 92) as deemed appropriate by thecommander. 5. Order the Soldier to receive the immunization. (b) If, after any of the steps listed in paragraph 5-4 c(2)(a), a Soldier elects to be immunized, adverse action will not normally be taken based solely on the initial declination. (c) When a General Court Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA) or the delegated representative determines that conditions of imminent threat exist (where the threat of naturally occurring disease or use of biological weapons isreasonably possible), Soldiers may be involuntarily immunized. Involuntary immunization(s) will not be ordered by acommander below the GCMCA unless authority to do so has been properly delegated by the GCMCA. Prior toordering involuntary immunizations, all of the steps outlined in paragraph (a), should be followed, situation permitting.In performing this duty, unit personnel will only use the amount of force necessary to assist medical personnel inadministering the immunization. (3) Isolation and quarantine. Isolation and quarantine for cases of suspected or proven communicable disease may be appropriate. (4) Detention. Detention on closed wards may be required when needed to ensure proper medical supervision or to protect the Soldier or others from harmful acts. (5) Medical care for mental disorders. Medical care related to the mental disorders of Soldiers who are found incompetent by a medical board may be given, provided life or health is not likely to be endangered by suchprocedures or care. (This provision also applies if the Soldier is believed incompetent and medical board action ispending.) These Soldiers may also be given routine medical care needed to treat minor ailments. (6) Diagnostic medical care. Medical care of a diagnostic nature may be undertaken in order to determine whether a situation exists that would authorize other medical care to be performed. (7) Physical and other examinations. Physical examinations and associated procedures, and dental or radiological examinations may be required when one or more of the following apply: (a) Required by law or regulation. (b) Authorized to be performed without consent by law or other regulations. (c) Directed by an individual's commander or other appropriate official in order to determine the individual's fitness for duty. (8) Obtaining evidence. Nothing in this paragraph limits the authority of appropriate officials to order the perform- ance of medical procedures for the purpose of obtaining evidence without the consent of the individual concerned, andwithout board action in cases where such procedures are authorized under other regulations or the Military Rules ofEvidence (MRE), MCM. d. Refusal to submit to medical care other than care described in paragraph c, above.(1) Soldiers who refuse to submit (or whose court-appointed guardian or other legal representative objects) to recommended medical care will be referred to a medical board (see AR 40-3). (2) Soldiers will be referred to a medical board if they refuse to submit to dental care and/or radiographic (X-ray) procedures deemed necessary by the installation dental surgeon to create dental record and panographic records of theoral dentition to\u2014 38 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(a) Aid in remains identification. (b) Treat dental conditions judged to be prejudicial to military operations or deployment that may result in evacuation or treatment within the first 12 months (see AR 40-400). (3) When a Soldier refuses to submit to recommended care because of religious practices, the provisions of paragraph 5-6 apply. e. Medical board proceedings when medical care is refused.(1) The examining medical boards report should contain the following information:(a) Statement that the proposed treatment will relieve the incapacity and aid the Soldier's return to a duty status. (b) Statement that the proposed treatment is an established procedure that qualified and experienced physicians ordinarily would recommend and undertake. (c) Statement that the Soldier's refusal to undergo treatment is reasonable or unreasonable, or, in the case of a mentally incompetent Soldier, a statement that compulsory treatment is warranted. Consideration should be made of therisks ordinarily associated with the proposed treatment, the Soldier's age, general physical condition, and his or herreasons for refusing treatment. (2) Generally, refusal of medical care is considered unreasonable without substantial evidence that the treatment is inadvisable. However, in deciding whether refusal of medical treatment, including surgery, is reasonable or unreasona-ble, the board should consider among other things\u2014 (a) Existing evidence that the physical or mental treatment is inadvisable. (b) Previous unsuccessful operations and procedures. (c) Any special risks involved in the proposed medical treatment. (3) The report of the medical board proceedings will show the need and risk of the proposed medical care refused by the Soldier. Moreover, it will show that the Soldier was given the chance to appear in person and will indicate if theSoldier's condition permitted appearing. The report will further show that the Soldier was given the chance to submit awritten statement explaining the grounds for refusal. Any statement submitted will be sent with the report. (4) Soldiers believed to be incompetent will be aided by a representative who may appear in their behalf. The representative need not be legally qualified. (5) The Soldier will be informed of the approved findings and advised whether the board has determined that the proposed medical care is needed to\u2014 (a) Protect the Soldier's health. (b) Protect the health of others. (c) Enable the Soldier to perform his or her duties properly. (6) The board findings must also state that the proposed care will have a positive effect.f. Results of medical board proceedings. Results of medical board proceedings. Soldiers must be given the results of the board proceedings and offered the opportunity to accept the prescribed medical care. If the Soldier still refuses, theMTF commander will send the medical board proceedings to HQDA (DASG-HS-AS), 5109 Leesburg Pike, FallsChurch, VA 22041-3258 for review. When refusal to submit to the prescribed medical care is based on religion, TSGwill refer the medical board proceedings to the DCS, G-1 for review and an advisory opinion before action. (1) TSG will either approve or disapprove the medical board proceedings and return them to the MTF commander.(2) If TSG approves the medical board proceedings, the Soldier is again given the chance to accept treatment. If the Soldier persists in refusing the medical care, the MTF commander refers the matter to the proper Special Court-MartialConvening Authority. Copies of the medical board proceedings are provided. If the Special Court-Martial ConveningAuthority orders the Soldier to submit to treatment and the Soldier refuses to obey, the commander may take\u2014 (a) Disciplinary action according to MCM. (b) Administrative action to separate the Soldier from service through retirement, discharge, or other legal means. 5-5. Family care plans a. The DCS, G-1 is responsible for policy on Family care plans as follows: (1) The Army assists the Soldier in providing for the care of his or her Family members. Mission, readiness, and deployability needs especially as it affects AA, ARNG, and RC single parents, parents with custody pursuant to a courtorder or separation agreement, and dual military couples with Family members. Plans must be made to ensure Familymembers are properly and adequately cared for when the Soldier is deployed, on TDY, or otherwise not available dueto military requirements. ARNG and RC Soldiers are subject to those policies and regulations, and will implementplans during any period of absence for AT, regularly scheduled unit training assemblies, emergency mobilization anddeployment, or other type of AD. Emergency-essential civilians who meet the criteria set forth in paragraph a are encouraged to have a Family care plan that follows the guidelines set forth in this regulation. (2) DA Form 5305 (Family Care Plan) is not a legal document that can change a court-mandated custodial arrangement, nor can it interfere with a natural parent's right to custody of his/her child. Its sole purpose is todocument for Army purposes the plan by which Soldiers provide for the care of their Family members when militaryduties prevent the Soldier from doing so. It will include proof that guardians and escorts have been thoroughly briefed 39 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014on the responsibilities they will assume for the sponsor/Soldier and the procedures for accessing military and civilian facilities and services on behalf of the Family members of the sponsor/Soldier. It will attest that the guardian and escortagreed to provide care and have been provided all necessary legal authority and means to do so. It will include proofthat the Soldier has obtained consent to the planned designation of guardianship from all parties with a legal interest inthe custody and care of the minor child, or proof that reasonable efforts have been made to obtain consent to suchdesignation. (3) As a minimum, proof will consist of the following attachments to DA Form 5305:(a) DA Form 5841 (Power of Attorney) or equivalent delegation of legal control (unsigned until deployment). (b) DA Form 5840 (Certificate of Acceptance as Guardian or Escort). (c) DD Form 1172-2 (Application for Identification Card/DEERS Enrollment) for each Family member. Note. AR 600-8-14 directs that ID cards will be issued for children under age 10 who reside with a single parent or dual military couple. (d) DD Form 2558 (Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change an Allotment) for AD or retired personnel, unsigned until deployment, or other proof of financial support arrangements. (e) A letter of instruction to the guardian/escort (see DA Form 5304 (Family Care Plan Counseling Checklist)). (f) If appropriate, DA Form 7666 (Parental Consent) as evidence of consent to the Family care plan from all parties with a legal interest in the custody of the minor child. (4) Soldiers are responsible for implementing the Family care plan and thus ensuring the care of their Family members. When operational or security considerations prevent the Soldier from implementing the plan, it will be usedby appropriate military or civilian authorities to obtain care for such Family members. DA Form 5305 may be executedat any time when conditions warrant and Family care is necessary due to the required military absence of the Soldier.DA Form 5304, DA Form 5305, DA Form 5840, and DA Form 5841 are available on the Army Publishing Directorate(APD) Web site. b. Commanders of AA and RC Soldiers, regardless of the Soldier's grade, will conduct or arrange for Family care plan counseling and require a Family care plan be completed when any of the following apply: (1) A pregnant Soldier who\u2014(a) Has no spouse; is divorced, widowed, or separated; or is residing without her spouse. (b) Is married to another Service member of an AA or RC of any Service (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, or Coast Guard). (2) A Soldier who has no spouse; is divorced, widowed, or separated, or is residing apart from his or her spouse; who has joint or full legal and physical custody of one or more Family members under the age of 19; or who has adultFamily members incapable of self-care regardless of age. (3) A Soldier who is divorced and not remarried, and who has liberal or extended visitation rights by court decree that allows Family members to be solely in the Soldier's care in excess of 30 consecutive days. (4) A Soldier whose spouse is incapable of self-care or is otherwise physically, mentally, or emotionally disabled so as to require special care or assistance. (5) A Soldier categorized as half of a dual-military couple of the AA or RC of any Service (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines, or Coast Guard) who has joint or full legal custody of one or more Family members under age 19 or who hasadult Family members incapable of self-care regardless of age. c. Soldiers must arrange for the care of their Family members in order to be\u2014 (1) Available for duty when and where the needs of the Army dictate.(2) Able to perform assigned military duties without interference of Family responsibilities.d. Enlisted Soldiers will be counseled on voluntary and involuntary separation whenever parenthood interferes with military responsibilities (see DA Form 5305) under provision of\u2014 (1) AR 635-200 for AA AR 135-91 for ARNG Soldiers.e. Officers will be counseled on voluntary and involuntary separations whenever parenthood interferes with military responsibilities (see DA Form 5305) under provision of\u2014 (1) AR 600-8-24 for AA Soldiers and RC and officers serving on AD or on ADT for a period in excess of 90 days.(2) AR 135-175 for ARNG and RC Soldiers, except for officers serving on AD or on ADT for a period in excess of 90 days. (3) NGR 635-101 for ARNG Soldiers.f. Pregnant Soldiers (who meet the criteria established in paragraph 5-5 b(1)) will be counseled\u2014 (1) In the AA, according to AR 600-8-24 for officers and AR 635-200 for enlisted Soldiers.(2) In the ARNG and RC, according to AR 135-91.(3) On costs of maternity care obtained from civilian sources and the limitations concerning maternity care in military medical facilities. 40 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(4) Using DA Form 5304 as soon as pregnancy is identified but not later than 90 days prior to the expected date of birth of the child. Pregnant Soldiers should receive Family care plan counseling at the time of pregnancy counseling toensure the Soldier is informed of the responsibilities if she chooses to remain on AD. (5) That they must complete and have an approved DA Form 5305 showing their intentions for Family care not later than 60 days prior to the date of the birth of the child. DA Form 5840 and DA Form 5841 or other guardianshipdocuments, DD Form 1172-2, and DD Form 2558, will be completed, and DA Form 5305 recertified not later than 45days following the date of birth of the child. g. The unit commander\u2014 (1) May designate an authorized representative to conduct Family care plan counseling using DA Form 5304 and to initial and sign the counseling form in the commander's behalf. The commander or authorized representative will useDA Form 7667 (Family Care Plan Preliminary Screening) to identify those Soldiers whose Family care plan may be atrisk and who should consult with an attorney. (2) Is the sole approving authority for DA Form 5305. This responsibility will not be delegated.(3) May authorize an additional 30 days (60 days total from date of counseling) to all AA Soldiers and 60 days (90 days total from the date of counseling) to all RC Soldiers for completion, including submission and final approval ofDA Form 5305 with attendant documents.

(7) Must adequately test the validity and durability of the Family care plan, to include contacting the designated guardian(s) prior to final approval or recertification. (8) Will provide the Soldier 30 days from date of the first disapproval to submit additional documentation or evidence to support the Family care plan. (9) Will provide the Soldier a reasonable period of time to attempt to rework a Family care plan found to be deficient at time of mobilization, processing for overseas movement, or deployment. Ordinarily, a Soldier will beafforded at least 30 days to correct deficiencies in a plan unless a shorter period is specified by the unit commanderdue to the urgency and/or nature of the deployment, or due to the nature of the deficiencies. (10) May authorize leave per AR 600-8-10 for a deployed Soldier to return home when circumstances beyond the Soldier's control preclude the designated guardian from exercising those responsibilities. (11) Should consider initiating a bar to reenlistment against Soldiers who fail to properly manage personal, marital, or Family affairs, or who fail to provide or maintain adequate Family care plans. (12) Should consider initiating involuntary separation proceedings against Soldiers who fail to provide and maintain adequate Family care plans. (13) Should take action to ensure he or she is aware of other situations that may create changes in the status of his or her Soldiers with regard to the Soldier's responsibility to support Family members. These include but are not limitedto the following: (a) Death or disability of spouse. (b) Legal separation when initial agreements have identified the Soldier as custodial parent or guardian of one or more Family members.

(15) Will ensure consent has been obtained pursuant to DA Form 7666 under appropriate circumstances, or proof of notice and/or reasonable efforts having been made to obtain consent to the Family care plan from all parties having alegal interest in the custody and care of the minor child. If consent has been denied, the commander will seek advice 41 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014from the servicing Office of the Staff Judge Advocate office and will advise the Soldier to contact a legal assistance attorney or an attorney he or she has retained at no expense to the government. h. The IRR, Individual Mobilization Augmentee, Standby Reserve, Category I and II retirees, and inactive national guard personnel who meet the criteria outlined in paragraph b(1) through (5) are required to maintain valid Family care plans to ensure their availability for AD during a mobilization. Therefore\u2014 (1) The CG, HRC will establish specific procedures for counseling, submission, validation, and recertification of Family care plans for RC personnel and category I/II retirees. (2) The Director, ARNG will establish specific procedures for the counseling, submission, validation, and recer- tification of Family care plans for inactive national guard personnel. i. All married Soldiers who have Family members are encouraged to complete and maintain a Family care plan even if not specifically required to do so by this regulation. To do so assists the spouse, commander, rear detachmentcommander, Family Assistance Center, or next of kin providing care for dependent Family members in the event thespouse is injured, ill, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to provide care for the dependent Family member. Counselingof such is also encouraged j. Soldiers must use the utmost care and consideration in the designation of guardians to care for Family members. (1) The parent of any minor children normally has a superior right to the custody of the minor children. If the Soldier designates an individual other than a parent for guardianship in the Family care plan, the Soldier must obtainconsent from the parent to such designation using the DA Form 7666. While such consent is not binding upon a courtof law, it demonstrates the other parent is aware of the custodial arrangements set forth in the Family care plan andagrees with those arrangements. Should a Soldier designate a person contrary to the provisions of an existing familylaw legal document (such as a divorce decree, court order, or marital separation agreement) the Soldier must seek legalassistance to modify the legal document. (2) Guardians should be persons to whom the Soldier would have no reservations entrusting the total welfare of his/ her child or other Family member. Guardians should be persons who are able to exercise that responsibility overextended periods of time, if necessary. (3) Soldiers have the responsibility to thoroughly brief guardians on arrangements made by the Soldier, location of all pertinent documents, and procedures for accessing military and civilian facilities, services, entitlements, and benefitson behalf of the dependent Family members. Guardians should be made aware that such designation does not authorizethem access to any of the military facilities, services, entitlement, or benefits for personal use, but only as the agent forthe dependent Family members for whom they have been designated guardian. Senior commanders are authorized toissue agents' letters to designated guardians upon request and presentation of proper documentation (such as DA Form5841, DA Form 5840, children's ID cards, or application for same). (4) If the guardian is located in an overseas area other than where the Soldier is stationed, the Family member's attendance at Department of Defense Dependent Schools and other schools may require an exception to policy becauseof the lack of command sponsorship. The Soldier and/or guardian must request the exception; it is not automatic. k. The following procedures will be used for completing DA Form 5304 and DA Form 5305. For all assignments, CONUS and OCONUS: (1) The DA Form 5304 will be used for counseling Soldiers who fall into categories outlined in paragraph b, above, as soon as possible upon arrival at the unit of assignment, and it will be initialed and signed\u2014 (a) During unit in-processing, after any event requiring completion of a Family care plan, or at Pre-Deployment processing. (b) By pregnant Soldiers not later than 90 days prior to the expected date of birth of the child. (c) By single parents, parents exercising custody pursuant to a court order or marital separation agreement, parents residing apart from his or her spouse and dual-military couples with Family members. (d) By both members of the dual-military couple and the respective commanders or designated representative. (This assures both unit commanders that Soldiers and their military spouses have made necessary arrangements for theescort, temporary, and primary guardianship responsibilities for Family member. Dual-military couple Soldiers withFamily members will be counseled together when practicable.) (e) By the unit commander or a designated representative and held in the unit suspense files pending completion of DA Form 5305. (It will be returned to the Soldier when no longer needed for suspense action.) (2) The DA Form 5305 will be\u2014(a) Completed and approved within 30 days for AA Soldiers and 60 days for ARNG and USAR Soldiers from the date of counseling. (b) Signed by both members of a dual-military couple and, if possible, by both commanders. The same plan should be submitted by both members of the dual-military couple, and neither member should be identified in the plan as thetemporary or long-term guardian. Once both commanders have approved and signed the plan, the commander whoseSoldier is least likely to deploy should retain the original plan and forward a copy of the complete plan to the othercommander. If both members are equally likely to deploy, but one is a Soldier and the spouse is a member of anotherService, the original plan should be kept on file in the Soldier's unit and a copy forwarded to the spouse's unit. If bothare Soldiers and equally likely to deploy, it is inconsequential which commander has the original copy of the plan. 42 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(c) Recertified at least annually by initialing and dating the DA Form 5305. This must be done during the anniversary of the Soldier's birth month, after any change of circumstance requiring a change in the Family care plan,or whenever the Soldier is mobilized, deployed, or processed for pre-deployment. Commanders should ensure that allinformation is current and all documents are still up-to-date and legally valid. (3) OCONUS assignment and deployment procedures are as follows:(a) All Soldiers in categories outlined in paragraph b who receive assignment instructions for an OCONUS assignment must be counseled again and must have their DA Form 5305 recertified not later than 30 days before thefinal out-processing date at the losing installation. If an adequate Family care plan is not submitted within 30 days, theSoldier is not considered deployable, will not depart the command, and the commander will consider initiatinginvoluntary separation proceeding. A copy of the approved DA Form 5305 will be filed in the Soldier's out-processingfile. A copy of the DA Form 5305 will be placed in the military personnel records jacket as a transfer document. Thelosing unit commander will retain a copy for 90 days after the Soldier departs. (b) Soldiers must arrange for an escort and transportation for Family members and a guardian in CONUS or United States territory to care for their Family members in the event their Family members are evacuated from OCONUS. Ifnoncombatant evacuation operation procedures are not initiated and Soldiers are alerted for deployment, Soldiersresiding in government quarters may request approval for guardians to reside in those quarters in their absence.Noncombatant evacuation operation standing operations should make maximum use of Family care plans to ensuresuccessful operations. Soldiers may also request that they, as a single parent or one member of a dual-military couple,be authorized to personally escort Family members back to CONUS-located guardian. They will be given theopportunity provided time allows and advanced return or early return of Family member paperwork is initiated perlocal command polices, the Joint Federal Travel Regulation, and Defense Foreign Clearance Guide guidance. (c) Soldiers unable to provide the unit commander with the required DA Form 5305 and attendant documents will be ineligible for overseas assignment. They should be considered for processing for separation from military Service.Policies regarding eligibility for overseas assignment are contained in AR 614-30. (d) Enlisted Soldiers without adequate Family care plans should be considered for separation processing by their unit commanders under the following regulations: 1. AR 635-200 for AA Soldiers. 2. AR 135-178 for ARNG and RC Soldiers. 3. AR 135-91 for ARNG and RC Soldiers. (e) Officers without adequate Family care plans should be considered for separation processing by their unit commanders under the following: 1. AR 600-8-24 for AA Soldiers. 2. AR 135-175 for ARNG and RC Soldiers. 3. NGR 635-101 for ARNG Soldiers. (f) The ARNG and RC Soldiers performing duty on an AD status (AT, ADT, AD for special work, TTAD, and AGR) OCONUS must re-certify DA Form 5305 with attendant documents before embarkation to show that adequatecare for their Family members has been provided for during their absence and in the event that their return to CONUSis delayed. Soldiers unable to provide the required documentation will not deploy to perform AT OCONUS. l. DA Form 5305 with attachments will be filed in the unit files and destroyed 90 days after the Soldier departs on PCS orders. In CONUS and OCONUS if the PCS move is a \"same-installation\" move and the Soldier can maintain thesame Family care plan, the Soldier will be allowed to take the original DA Form 5305 to the gaining unit and need notgenerate a new DA Form 5305. The gaining commander should certify the existing DA Form 5305 when the Soldierarrives in the new unit. (1) Provide a copy of the DA Form 5305 to the Soldier, dual-military couple spouse, and dual-military spouse's commander. (2) Place a copy of the DA Form 5305 in the military Personnel Records Jacket that accompanies the departing Soldier to the gaining unit. (3) Ensure that in the event of deployment, the Family care plan files remain with the rear detachment, or if no rear detachment remains, with the Family Assistance Center servicing the departing unit. Army National Guard and RCcommanders must ensure Family care plan files are transferred to Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ)/RSC)/GOCOMbefore departing home station. m. A copy of DA Form 5305 with copies of DA Form 5840 and DA Form 5841, and/or other appropriate documents will be provided to the Child and Youth Services (CYS) Program if the CYS certified Family Child CareProvider is designated as temporary guardian. AR 608-10 requires that a copy of DA Form 5305 be on file at themilitary Child Development Center if the Soldier's Family members are enrolled in the day care or extended careprogram. n. Commanders must stress the Soldier's obligation to both the military and to his/her Family members. Moreover, they must ensure Soldiers understand they will not receive special consideration in duty assignments or duty stationsbased on their responsibilities for Family members unless enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member Program (seeAR 608-75 for more information). They must also ensure that Soldiers are aware that the Family care plan is not a 43 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014legal document that can change a court mandated custodial arrangement, nor can it interfere with a natural parent's right to custody of his/her children. The main evidence that Soldiers have made adequate arrangements for the care oftheir dependent Family members will be the execution of DA Form 5305 with its attendant documents listed below\u2014 (1) DA Form 5841, special power of attorney or other legal documents designating escort, temporary, and primary guardian(s) (unsigned until the Soldier is deployed). (2) Notarized DA Form 5840 from person(s) named in power of attorney.(3) Completed DD Form 1172-2 for each Family member.(4) Completed DD Form 2558 (unsigned until deployment) or proof of other adequate financial arrangements for care of Family members. (5) Letters of instructions containing additional pertinent information for escorts, temporary or long-term guardians (see DA Form 5840). (6) Completed DA Form 7667.(7) Copies of any child custody orders or marital separation agreements currently in effect that impact upon the custody of a Soldier's minor children. (8) Completed DA Form 7666 under appropriate circumstances, or proof of notice and/or reasonable efforts having been made to obtain consent to the Family care plan from all parties having a legal interest in the custody and care ofthe minor children. o. Commanders will encourage Soldiers to consult with a legal assistance attorney about having a will prepared. The Family care plan does not require a will, and Soldiers will not be ordered to obtain a will. When a will is prepared, itwill not be retained in the unit files. Soldiers will be encouraged but not required to ensure that information regardingthe location of a Soldier's will is contained in the Family care plan. p. The AA commanders will continue to use the Family Care Counseling Report (SIDPERS AAA-338) until such time as the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System comes on line. q. Maximum feasible testing of the validity and durability of Family care plans will be accomplished (for example, during exercises, alerts, Pre-Deployment processing, mobilization, deployment, AT, and other unit activities) to ensureinformation in a Soldier's DA Form 5305 is accurate, current, and executable. Family care plans found to be invalidduring the above testing will be revised/recertified within 30 days of the finding. For ARNG and RC Soldiers, it willbe revised/recertified within 60 days unless mobilization mission requirements preclude authorizing that amount oftime. 5-6. Accommodating religious practices a. The Army places a high value on the rights of its Soldiers to observe tenets of their respective religions or to observe no religion at all. In accordance with Sections 2000bb through 2000bb-4, Title 42, United States Code (42USC 2000bb - 2000bb-4) and DODI 1300.17, the Army will approve requests for accommodation of religious practicesunless accommodation will have an adverse impact on unit readiness, individual readiness, unit cohesion, morale, goodorder, discipline, safety, and/or health. As used in this regulation, these factors will be referred to individually andcollectively as \"military necessity.\" All requests for accommodation of religious practices will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Each request must be considered based on its unique facts; the nature of the requested religiousaccommodation; the effect of approval or denial on the Soldier's exercise of religion; and the effect of approval ordenial on military necessity. Accommodation of a Soldier's religious practices must be examined against militarynecessity and cannot be guaranteed at all times. b. The ASA (M&RA) will oversee the implementation and execution of this paragraph to ensure compliance with DOD and Army policy. c. The DCS, G-1 will develop policy on the accommodation of religious practices within the Army. d. The following will ensure that every enlisted (to include reenlistment), warrant, cadet, and commissioned officer applicant is informed of the Army's religious accommodation policy as set forth in this regulation and, furthermore,that applicants acknowledge in writing that they have been so informed: (1) The CG, U.S. Army Recruiting Command (for initial enlisted and AMEDD officer accessions).(2) The CG, TRADOC (for all ROTC cadets, WO candidates, and officer candidates).(3) The Judge Advocate General (for all judge advocate officer accessions).(4) The Chief of Chaplains (for all chaplain officer accessions).(5) Superintendent, USMA (for all USMA cadet applicants).e. The Chief of Chaplains will serve as advisor to the DCS, G-1 on matters pertaining to religious accommodation and formulate and disseminate education and training programs regarding religious traditions and practices within theArmy. f. The CG, TRADOC will ensure that training on the provisions of this chapter is provided for commanders, chaplains, and judge advocates. g. Unit commanders will approve or disapprove requests for accommodation of religious practices which do not require a waiver of Army policy on uniform wear, appearance, and/or grooming. If a commander determines partial or 44 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014complete denial is appropriate, he/she will prepare a memorandum specifying the basis for denial and provide a copy of the memorandum to the Soldier. Commanders who rescind a previously approved religious accommodation willprepare a memorandum specifying the basis for rescission and provide a copy of the memorandum to the Soldier.Denial or rescission must be based upon one or more of the criteria discussed in paragraph 5-6 a. h. Requests for religious accommodation generally fall into five major areas: (1) Worship practices. Some religious groups have worship requirements that conflict with the Soldier's normal availability for duty; for example worship on days other than Saturday or Sunday, a 25-hour Sabbath, or special holydays or periods. These will be accommodated except when precluded by military necessity. If the time required forreligious worship falls within normal duty hours or duty rosters, the Soldier may request exception from those hoursand rosters. The Soldier, however, must be prepared to perform alternative duty or duty hours. Commanders may grantordinary leave as an option to Soldiers who desire to observe lengthy holy periods or days. (2) Dietary practices. Some faith groups have religious tenets that prohibit the eating of specific foods, or prescribe a certain manner in which food must be prepared. A Soldier with a conflict between the diet provided by the Army andthat required by religious practice may request an exception to policy to ration separately. Religious belief is groundsfor granting such an exception. The Soldier may also request permission to take personal supplemental rations when ina field or combat environment. (3) Medical practices. (a) Some religious practices conflict with normal Army medical procedures. These practices include beliefs in self- care, and prohibitions against immunizations, blood transfusions, or surgery. (b) A Soldier whose religious tenets involve self-care may request accommodation for non-emergency or non-life- threatening illness or injury. Medical treatment may be deferred pending a decision on whether or not to accommodatethe Soldier's religious practices; however, the unit and MTF commanders will consider the time constraints for theSoldier to recuperate without military medical care when determining whether or not to grant the request foraccommodation. (c) Soldiers who refuse to submit (or whose court-appointed guardian or other legal representative objects) to recommended medical treatment because of religious objections will be referred to an ad hoc committee established bythe medical commander. The composition of and procedures followed by this committee are at the discretion of thatcommander, except that the committee must include a chaplain and be chaired by a medical corps officer. In addition,all committee members must be officers or full-time employees of the Federal Government. (d) The medical board's report will include the following information: 1. Proposed treatment required to relieve the incapacity and aid the Soldier's return to duty status, and expectation to perform such treatment. 2. The need for the medical care refused by the Soldier. 3. Reasonableness of the Soldier's refusal to undergo treatment. (The risks ordinarily associated with the proposed treatment, the Soldier's age, general physical condition, and the reasons for refusing treatment will be considered andarticulated in this report.) 4. Evidence that the Soldier was given the opportunity to appear before the board in person; submit a written statement; or submit written statements from a member of his or her faith group. If circumstances do not permit theSoldier to appear in person or submit a written statement (or both), or the Soldier declines to appear in person orsubmit a written statement; then the board will include this information in the report. 5. Soldiers believed incompetent will be aided by an appointed representative who may appear on their behalf. The representative need not be legally qualified. Rationale for the determination of incompetency will be included in thereport. All Soldiers referred to committee will have the right to a representative. 6. The Army's concern is with the possible effects of accommodation on the Soldier's health and ability to carry out assigned tasks, the health of others, and the military medical system. If the examining board finds that the proposedmedical care is needed based on any of these concerns, then the Soldier must be informed and given the opportunity toaccept the prescribed medical care. If the Soldier still refuses the medical treatment commander will forward themedical board proceedings to TSG, who will approve or disapprove the medical board proceedings and return them tothe MTF commander. 7. TSG will provide a copy of this determination to Office Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1, (DAPE-MPC), Washington, DC 20310-0300. 8. If TSG approves the medical board proceedings, the Soldier is again given the opportunity to accept the treatment. If the Soldier refuses, the MTF refers the matter to the Soldier's special court-martial convening authorityfor action as that authority deems appropriate. 9. In emergency situations the MTF may order, or the attending physician may take, immediate steps in accordance with local MTF policy to save a Soldier's life regardless of religious practices or objections. (e) Immunization requirements for Soldiers are described in AR 40-562. Soldiers whose religious practices conflict with immunization requirements may request an exemption through command channels to TSG. 1. Requests for religious exemption must include name, rank, MOS/branch, the name of the recognized religious group, date of the applicant's affiliation, a description of the religious tenet or belief contrary to immunization, and 45 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014supporting certification signed by an authorized personal religious counselor. The counselor attests that the applicant is an active member in good standing of the religious group, adheres to tenets consistent with the espoused religiousbeliefs, and the religious group has a tenet or belief opposing immunizations. 2. A military chaplain must counsel the applicant and recommend approval or denial of the exemption request by endorsement. The chaplain should attempt to ascertain the validity of the Servicemember's request. The chaplain'sendorsement should address the above issues to the greatest extent possible based on their counseling and knowledgeof the individual and the individual's religion. 3. A military physician must counsel the applicant. The physician should ensure that the applicant is making an informed decision and should address, at a minimum, the following: a. Specific information about the diseases concerned; b. Specific vaccine information including benefits and risks; and c. Potential risks of infection incurred by unimmunized individuals. 4. The applicant's commander must counsel the applicant and recommend approval or denial of the exemption request. The commander must counsel that noncompliance with immunization requirements may adversely impactdeployability, assignment, or international travel, and that the exemption may be revoked under imminent riskconditions. The commander, in making his or her recommendation, should consider the potential impact on the factorsof military necessity described in paragraph 5-6a. 5. Commanders will forward exemption requests through command channels to TSG. 6. Religious exemptions may be revoked in the case of an imminent risk of exposure to a disease for which an immunization is available. (4) Wear and appearance of the uniform. Religious jewelry, apparel, or articles (hereafter referred to as religious items) may be worn while in uniform if they are \"neat and conservative.\" Except as noted in the following paragraphs,wear of religious items that do not meet the standards of AR 670-1 is not authorized unless a religious accommodationis granted in accordance with the procedures of paragraph 5-6 i. (a) In accordance with 10 USC 774, Soldiers may wear items of religious apparel while in uniform, except where the items would interfere with the performance of military duties or the items are not neat and conservative. (b) For religious accommodation purposes only, neat and conservative items of religious apparel are those that: (1) are discreet, tidy, and not dissonant or showy in style, size, design, brightness, or color; (2) Do not replace or interferewith the proper wear of any authorized article of the uniform; (3) Are not temporarily or permanently affixed orappended to any authorized article of the uniform. (c) Factors used to determine if an item of religious apparel interferes with military duties include, but are not limited to, whether or not the item: (1) Impairs the safe and effective operation of weapons, military equipment, ormachinery; (2) Poses a health or safety hazard to the Soldier wearing the religious apparel and/or others; (3) Interfereswith the wear or proper function of special or protective clothing or equipment; (4) Otherwise impairs the accomplish-ment of the military mission. (d) Wear of religious items that are not visible or apparent when in duty uniform is authorized, provided they do not interfere with the performance of the Soldier's military duties or interfere with the proper wearing of any authorizedarticle of the uniform. Examples of such items include (but are not limited to) religious jewelry worn under the dutyuniform or copies of religious symbols or writing carried by the individual in wallets or pockets. Wear of religiousitems that are visible or apparent are governed by the standards of AR 670-1. (e) Religious jewelry (for example, that is visible or apparent) when in duty uniform is authorized if it meets the standards for wear of jewelry in AR 670-1. Jewelry bearing religious symbols or worn for religious reasons will not besingled out; all wear and appearance standards will apply equally to religious and non-religious jewelry. (f) Religious items that do not meet the standards of AR 670-1 may be worn by Soldiers in uniform while they are present at a worship service, rite, or other ritual distinct to a faith or denominational group. Commanders may, foroperational or safety reasons, limit the wear of non-subdued items of religious apparel during services conducted in thefield based on military necessity. (g) Religious headgear may be worn while in uniform if the headgear meets the following criteria: 1. The religious headgear is subdued in color (generally black, brown, green, dark or Navy blue, or a combination of these colors). 2. The religious headgear is of a style and size that can be completely covered by standard military headgear. 3. The religious headgear bears no writing, symbols, or pictures. 4. Wear of the religious headgear does not interfere with the wear or proper functioning of protective clothing or equipment. 5. Religious headgear that meets these criteria is authorized irrespective of the faith group from which it originates. 6. Religious headgear will not be worn in place of military headgear under circumstances when the wear of military headgear is required (for example, when the Soldier is outside or required to wear headgear indoors for a specialpurpose). (h) Chaplains may wear religious attire as described in AR 670-1, CTA 50-909, and AR 165-1 in the performance 46 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014of religious services and other official duties as required. Commanders may not prohibit chaplains from wearing those religious symbols that are part of the chaplain's duty uniform. (i) Physical training uniforms present a particular problem for Soldiers of both genders and many religious faiths, due to concerns about modesty. Such concerns are not only religious, but at times are based in social or regionalperspectives. Differences in physiology and physical comfort levels between individual Soldiers also affect wear of thePT uniform. Commanders have the authority to prescribe uniformity in PT formations. They will, however, considerthe factors noted above if doing so. (5) Grooming practices. The Army's grooming standards are contained in AR 670-1. Religious-based exceptions to policy previously given Soldiers under the provisions of this regulation prior to 1 January 1986 continue in effect aslong as the affected Soldiers remain otherwise qualified for retention. However, Soldiers previously granted authorityto wear unshorn hair, unshorn beard, or permanent religious jewelry prior to 1 January 1986 will not be assigned PCSor TDY out of CONUS due to health and safety considerations. i. Requests for accommodation. (1) Requests for religious accommodation of wear and appearance of the uniform, personal appearance, and personal grooming practices of AR 670-1 may only be approved or disapproved by the SecArmy or the designee. All othercommand levels will neither approve nor deny the religious accommodation request but will make recommendations asto whether the request should be approved or denied and forward through command levels to the DCS, G-1. Soldiersrequesting an accommodation must continue to comply with AR 670-1 until the religious accommodation request isapproved. (2) Soldiers will submit requests for religious accommodation to their immediate commander. Except as listed in paragraph 5-6 i(1), the commander may approve the request either informally or formally (in writing) or disapprove it. Commanders will respond to requests for religious accommodation within 10 working days of receipt. (3) If a commander approves a request informally the issue is closed, except that the commander will assist the Soldier in completing those actions necessary to the accommodation (for example, obtaining permission to rationseparately or adjusting the unit duty roster). (4) If the commander approves a request formally, the commander will provide the Soldier with written notice of the accommodation. The accommodation will then remain in effect unless revoked, in writing, by the commander whooriginally granted it (due to changed conditions); by a subsequent commander of that unit; by a commander of againing unit if the Soldier is transferred; or by a higher commander. If the accommodation is revoked, the writtennotice of revocation accompanied by a copy of the original accommodation will constitute an appeal and will beforwarded through command channels in accordance with the routing described in paragraph 5-6 i5. (5) If the commander disapproves the request, he or she will afford the Soldier the opportunity to appeal the disapproval. This appeal will be done by means of a memorandum from the Soldier through each level of command (tospecifically include the ACOM, ASCC, or DRU) to the DCS, G-1 (DAPE-MPC). At a minimum, the memorandumwill include: the name, rank, social security number, unit, and MOS of the Soldier; the nature of the accommodationrequested; the religious basis for the request; and endorsements by commander(s). Enclosures will accompany thememorandum. Mandatory enclosures are a memorandum from a chaplain and a copy of the legal review. Optionalenclosures include statements by peers or officials of the Soldier's faith group, copies of religious writings, statements,doctrinal declarations bearing on the Soldier's request, documents pertaining to the character of the Soldier's service,and (if appropriate) a statement from the Soldier explaining in more detail the nature of the request. (6) The assigned unit chaplain, or other chaplain determined by the senior chaplain present, will interview the Soldier concerning the request for accommodation. A memorandum stating that this interview has occurred willaccompany the request for appeal. This memorandum will address the religious basis and sincerity of the Soldier'srequest. The chaplain is not required to recommend approval or disapproval, but may do so if desired. Memorandafrom other chaplains may accompany the appeal as optional attachments, but do not meet the requirement for interviewby the assigned unit chaplain or one determined by the senior chaplain present. (7) Evidence of legal review will be in accordance with local staff judge advocate (SJA) procedures. A legal advisor will review the appeal packet for legal sufficiency and may make a recommendation for disposition of the appeal. Thereview will also state whether the appeal memorandum and enclosures are complete within the provisions of thisregulation. (8) If a commander at any level approves the request for accommodation, written approval will be returned to the Soldier through channels. If the commander disapproves it, the packet will be so endorsed and forwarded to the nextlevel of command. (9) If all levels of command disapprove the request for accommodation, the packet will be forwarded to the DCS, G-l (DAPE-MPC) for final decision. (10) The decision of DCS, G-1 will be transmitted through channels to the Soldier requesting accommodation within 30 days after receipt of the request. Appeals to decisions by the DCS, G-1 will not be entertained. Religiousaccommodations granted by the DCS, G-1 may only be revoked by the DCS, G-1. (11) Appeals to denials of accommodation will reach the DCS, G-1 within 30 days after the Soldier submits the appeal (60 days OCONUS). 47 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(12) A religious accommodation application that has been considered and disapproved by the DCS, G-1 will not be reconsidered. However, an applicant may submit second and later formal applications to his or her unit commander.These applications will be considered only if\u2014 (a) They are not based upon substantially the same grounds, or (b) They are not supported by substantially the same evidence as a previously disapproved application. (c) When a second or later formal application is received, the unit commander will forward the application and any documents submitted with it to the headquarters of the applicant's SPCMCA. At this headquarters the religiousaccommodation application will receive a legal review to determine whether it is substantially the same as a previousapplication disapproved by the DCS, G-1. After the legal review and opinion, the command is authorized to return to aapplicant, without action, any second or later application under this regulation when review reveals that it is substan-tially the same as a religious accommodation request previously denied by the DCS, G-1. (13) Soldiers whose appeals are denied may request separation from the Army under the provisions of AR 635-200. Commissioned or WOs who request separation for reasons of religious accommodation will follow the application forrelease from AD as prescribed in AR 600-8-24 (for other than RA), or apply for an unqualified resignation as outlinedin AR 600-8-24 (for RA). All personnel separated or discharged from the U.S. Army because of conflict between theirreligious practices and military requirements will be subject to recoupment of Federal funds as outlined in referencedregulations. j. Nothing in this regulation will be construed to limit the authority of commanders to enforce standards by means of all applicable provisions of the UCMJ while requests and appeals are being processed. Soldiers are obligated to adhereto orders and standards set by their immediate commanders. 5-7. Prohibition of military labor unions a. Incompatibility with military Service.(1) Soldiers must be prepared to fight and if necessary, place their own personal safety in jeopardy in order to defend the Constitution of the United States and their fellow citizens. Therefore, discipline and prompt obedience to thelawful orders of seniors are essential and time-honored elements of the American military tradition. From the earliestArticles of War, laws and regulations have prohibited conduct detrimental to the military chain of command and lawfulmilitary authority. (2) Unionization of the Army is incompatible with the military chain of command. It would undermine the role, authority, and position of the commander. It would impair the morale and readiness of the Army. Therefore, Soldierswill not take part in conventional labor-management negotiation or collective bargaining with their military and civilianseniors. Nor will they take part in strikes, slowdown, picketing, or other traditional forms of job actions. (3) Circumstances that could constitute a threat to the ability of the Army to perform its mission are not comparable to circumstances that could constitute a threat to the ability of Federal civilian agencies to perform their functions. b. Responsibilities. Senior commanders will report activities prohibited by this regulation immediately to DCS, G-1 (DAPE-HR-S), Washington, DC 20310-0300. Reports will be made by priority message and information copies willbe sent to intermediate commanders. c. Prohibited activities.(1) Enrollment and membership. (a) A member of the Army, knowing of the activities of a particular military labor organization may not\u2014 1. Join or maintain membership in such an organization. 2.

(b) No person on a military installation, and no member of the Armed Forces, may enroll in a military labor organization or solicit or accept dues or fees for such an organization from any member of the Armed Forces. (2) Negotiation or bargaining. (a) No person on a military installation, and no member of the Armed Forces, may negotiate or bargain, or attempt through any coercive act to negotiate or bargain with any civilian officer, or employee, or any member of the ArmedForces on behalf of members of the Armed Forces concerning the terms or conditions of service of such members. (b) No member of the Armed Forces and no civilian officer, or employee, may negotiate or bargain on behalf of the U.S. Government concerning the terms or conditions of military Service of members of the Armed Forces with anypersons who represents or purports to represent members of the Armed Forces. (3) Strikes or other concerted labor actions. (a) No person on a military installation, and no member of the Armed Forces may organize or attempt to organize, or participate in, any strike, picketing, march, demonstration, or other similar form of concerted action involvingmembers of the Armed Forces that is directed against the Government of the United States and that is intended toinduce any civilian officer or employee, or any member of the Armed Forces to\u2014 1. Negotiate or bargain with any person about the terms or conditions of service of any member of the Armed Forces. 2. Recognize any military labor organization as a representative of individual members of the Armed Forces in 48 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014connection with any complaint or grievance of any such member arising out of the terms or conditions of service of such member in the Armed Forces. 3. Make changes in the terms or conditions of military Service in the Armed Forces of individual members of the Armed Forces. (b) No person may use any military installation for any meeting, march, picketing, demonstration, or other similar activity for the purpose of engaging in any activity prohibited by this regulation. (c) No member of the Armed Forces, and no civilian officer or employee, may permit or authorize the use of any military installation for any meeting, march, picketing, demonstration, or other similar activity that is for the purpose ofengaging in any activity prohibited by this regulation. (4) Representation. A military labor organization may not represent, or attempt to represent any member of the Armed Forces before any civilian officer or employee, or any member of the Army, in connection with any grievanceor complaint of any such member arising out of the terms or conditions of service of such member of the Army. (5) Violations of policy. Violations of this policy provide a basis for disciplinary action under UCMJ in addition to appropriate administrative sanctions. d. Permitted activities.(1) This regulation will not limit the rights of Soldiers to\u2014(a) Belong to lawful organizations other than military labor organizations. (b) Present complaints through established military channels. (c) Seek or receive information or counseling from authorized sources. (d) Be represented by authorized counsel in any legal or quasi-legal proceeding, according to applicable laws and regulations. (e) Petition the Congress for redress of grievances. (f) Take other administrative action for administrative or judicial relief as is authorized by applicable laws and regulations. (2) This regulation does not prevent eligible DA civilian employees from belonging to labor unions.e. Making determinations.(1) To determine if an organization is a military labor organization and if it is in violation of this regulation, the following will be evaluated: (a) Its history and operation. (b) Its constitution and bylaws. (c) The evidence gathered for any suspected prohibited act. (2) To determine if a person belongs to a military labor organization and if they are in violation of this regulation, the following will be evaluated: (a) Their history and conduct. (b) The evidence gathered for any suspected prohibited act. (3) To determine if a person acted for a military labor organization when they committed a prohibited act, the following will be considered: (a) The frequency of such acts. (b) The position of the person in the organization. (c) If the acts were known and condemned or disavowed by the organization's leadership. f. Gathering information. Personnel gathering information about persons and organizations to make the determina- tions required by this chapter must strictly comply with AR 380-13. Counterintelligence or security investigationpersonnel may not gather such information. The organization itself should be considered the primary source ofinformation. 5-8. Complaints or accusations against military personnel a. Guidelines for implementation. The policies outlined in this paragraph are intended to provide broad and general guidance. The Inspector General Action Request System (that differs in procedure from that found in this para) isgoverned by AR 20-1. Accusations of a criminal nature are reported and investigated according to AR 195-1.Complaints by Soldiers and Family members of discrimination based upon race, color, religion, national origin, andgender (including sexual harassment) follow the procedures set forth in chapters 6 and 7 of this regulation.

At the same time, Soldiers are generally entitled to free access to news and publications. b. Policy. Senior commanders will encourage and promote the availability of books, periodicals, and other printed media that present a wide range of viewpoints on public issues to Soldiers. Such media should include thoseemphasizing the standards of loyalty, patriotism, and discipline that are common to the Armed Forces. However, seniorcommanders will not, except as provided in this paragraph and in AR 360-1, take action to control or restrictdissemination, even if these publications are believed to be in poor taste or unfairly critical of Government policies orofficials. The senior commander will be guided by the principle that, except in cases in which a publication constitutesa clear danger to military loyalty, discipline, or morale, or specifically violates the law or regulatory authority, militarypersonnel are entitled to the same free access to publications as are other citizens. c. Distribution outlets. A senior commander may impose a requirement that distribution of printed media may not be made except through regularly established and approved distribution outlets, unless prior approval is obtained from thecommander or authorized representative. AR 210-7 and AR 360-1 provide further explanation and guidance. Thesenior commander may, without informing higher headquarters, or Department of the Army in advance, take appropri-ate action to prevent the distribution of non-DOD commercial publications by persons who have not obtained therequired approval or have not complied with this regulation, AR 210-7, and AR 360-1. Except when the publication inquestion is published primarily for advertising or promotional purposes, a denial of a request for distribution will bereported as required in paragraph d. d. Restrictions on dissemination. If it appears that a publication presents a clear danger to the loyalty, discipline, or morale of Soldiers, the senior commander may, without prior approval of higher headquarters, delay distribution onproperty subject to his/her control. The commander will consider whether the act of restriction will in itself result in thepublication in question achieving notoriety and increased circulation to military personnel through off-post sources. (1) The commander's directive to delay distribution will be in writing.(2) Concurrently with imposing a delay authorized above, the senior commander will inform, by telephone, the next major commander and HQDA (SAPA), Washington, DC 20310-0300. (3) When a delay in dissemination of a publication through either official or unofficial outlets is imposed by the commander, they will, within 5 working days thereafter\u2014 50 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(a) Review the publication in question. (b) Prepare a written recommendation to HQDA that provides the basic facts for the determination that distribution of the subject publication would present a clear danger to the loyalty, discipline, or morale of the Soldiers on his or herinstallation. (c) Send recommendation, together with a copy of the subject publication, to HQDA (SAPA) Washington, DC 20310. Appropriate information copies should also be provided to intermediate headquarters.

Soldiers assigned overseas, or whose residential address should not be disclosed in the commander'sjudgment because of security or safety concerns, will provide a duty address to DEERS. 5-12. Military Whistleblower Protection Act Department of the Army personnel are prohibited from taking acts of reprisal against any Soldier for filing a complaint of unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment (see DODD 7050.06). a. No person will restrict a member of the Armed Services from making a protected communication with a Member of Congress; an IG; a member of a DOD audit, inspection, investigation, or law enforcement organization; or any otherperson or organization (including any person in the chain of command) designated under this regulation or otheradministrative procedures to receive such communication. b. A protected communication is\u2014 (1) Any lawful communication with a Member of Congress or an IG.(2) A communication in which a member of the Armed Forces communicates information that the member reasonably believes evidences a violation of law or regulation, including a law or regulation prohibiting sexualharassment or unlawful discrimination, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds or other resources, an abuse ofauthority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, when such communication is made to any ofthe following: (a) A Member of Congress, an IG, or a member of a DOD audit, inspection, investigation, or law enforcement organization. (b) Any person or organization in the chain of command; or any other person designated pursuant to regulations or other established administrative procedures to receive such communications. c. Soldiers will be free from reprisal for making or preparing a protected communication. d. No employee or Soldier may take or threaten to take an unfavorable personnel action, or to withhold or threaten t o w i t h h o l d a f a v o r a b l e p e r s o n n e l a c t i o n , i n r e p r i s a l a g a i n s t a n y S o l d i e r f o r m a k i n g o r p r e p a r i n g a p r o t e c t e d communication. e. The chain of command will ensure complainants are protected from reprisal or retaliation for filing EO com- plaints. Should Soldiers be threatened with such an act, or should an act of reprisal occur, they must report thesecircumstances to the DOD IG. If the allegation of reprisal is made known to any agency authorized in this regulation toreceive complaints, the agency should refer the complaint to the DOD IG. It is strongly encouraged to simultaneouslyreport such threats or acts of reprisal to the appropriate chain of command.

Personnel calling from OCONUS may dial (703) 604-8569; or, mail a letter toDepartment of Defense Inspector General (Defense Hotline), 1900 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-1900. 5-13. Human relations readiness training a. There is an indisputable link between how Soldiers are treated and how they perform their duties. Human relations training directly affects individual and unit readiness. Training commanders and Soldiers to treat one anotherwith dignity and respect achieves better morale, greater commitment, increased trust and cohesion and better perform-ance. The DCS, G-1, is the sole proponent for HRRT. b. The five key training elements of HRRT are\u2014 (1) Army policy and/or commander's intent. This is the most obvious aspect of HRRT in that Soldiers must know and understand Army human relations policy (for example, what fraternization is and is not). (2) Prevention and intervention. The HRRT is proactive, targeting high-risk Army populations that some research suggests are more likely to exhibit extremism in the form of racial and ethnic hatred, intolerance and discrimination.Soldiers living in barracks and serving on peacekeeping deployments are among these high-risk Army populations.HRRT is also interventional, responding to emergent Armywide or unit-specific human relations problems. (3) Command climate awareness. Commanders periodically must assess their specific unit's human relations readi- ness climate in order to contextualize HRRT to the unit's mission and personal dimensions of living and workingtogether. (4) Building Soldier skills. HRRT empowers Soldiers to do the right thing. To best accomplish this, HRRT incorporates successful and proven adult learning models (for example, group discussion of scenarios). (5) Values. HRRT incorporates values essential to Army readiness, with \"Dignity and Respect for All\" as the foundational human relations value. Other values include (but are not limited to) Army values (leadership, forexample), doing the right thing, safe environment, trust and confidence, good order and discipline, chain of commandsupport, fairness, and valuing differences. 5-14. Unit memorial policy Unit memorial ceremonies and services show respect to the service of Soldiers who have died, and offer support to unit survivors. These memorial events assist surviving Soldiers in dealing with the realities of death and honor the military 53 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Service and the contribution the Soldier made while in uniform. The unit memorial event allows surviving Soldiers a means for expressing their grief and assists in the healing process. a. Command responsibilities . Commanders will conduct a memorial event (Memorial Ceremony or Memorial Service) for every Soldier who dies while assigned to their unit, regardless of the manner of death to include suicides.The manner of death does not negate the service and the contribution a Soldier has made while in uniform, except asprescribed in paragraph b. Commanders will also notify their supporting Casualty Assistance Center of the time and place of unit memorial events. b. Command exceptions . Unit commanders may request an exception to policy not to conduct a memorial event through their command channels. The first general officer in the chain of command may approve the exception onlywhen the deceased Soldier\u2014 (1) Has been convicted of a capital offense under Federal or State law for which the person was sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole; or (2) Has been convicted of a serious offense, which is defined as a military or civilian offense, which if prosecuted under the UCMJ, could be punished by confinement of 6 months or more and/or a punitive discharge; or (3) Is found by the first general officer in the chain of command to have committed a capital offense or serious offense, as used herein, but the deceased Soldier has not been convicted of such crime because the Soldier was notavailable for trial due to his/her death. c. Elements of the memorial events . Recognizing the military Service of the Soldier provides healing and renewal for the living. The opportunity to provide closure for members of the unit is offered during a memorial event. TheCommander's decision whether to conduct a Memorial Ceremony or a Memorial Service is dependent upon manyfactors to include the unit mission, tactical situation, and the wishes of Family members in the local area. (1) Memorial Ceremony . A Memorial Ceremony is a command program with a ceremonial orientation. As a command program, attendance of Soldiers at a Memorial Ceremony may be made mandatory. Although there arereligious aspects to the memorial ceremony, such as an invocation and benediction, the major focus will be on militarytributes and honors. A Memorial Ceremony may include the following: Prelude, Posting of the Colors, NationalAnthem, Invocation, Memorial Tribute, Readings, Address, Memorial Prayers, Silent Tribute or Roll Call, Music,Benediction, Firing of Volleys, and Sounding of Taps. The Soldier's remains are not present for this ceremony. (2) Memorial Service . A Memorial Service is a command program with a religious orientation. A Memorial Service should be sensitive to the deceased Soldier's faith group and to the needs of the Soldiers who voluntarily attend.Attendance of units and Soldiers may be encouraged and supported by command, but will not be made mandatory. AMemorial Service may include the following: Prelude, Invocation, Scripture Reading, Meditation, Prayer, Silent Tributeor Roll Call, and Benediction. The Soldier's remains are not present for this service. (3) Ramp Ceremony . A Ramp Ceremony is a command-directed activity normally only occurring in a deployed environment that may be conducted in addition to a unit memorial event. It does not replace the requirement to conducta memorial event. The combatant commander normally establishes policies within a theater of operations that mayrestrict or preclude the conduct of this ceremony in order to ensure the expeditious movement of remains. In locationswhere this ceremony is permitted and is normally conducted, the requirements outlined in paragraphs a and b apply. d. Combatant theater memorial events . Commanders of units deployed to combatant theaters or other contingency operations may conduct a memorial event in the theater as the tactical situation permits and another event upon returnto home station. e. Family member attendance . As part of the Army Family Covenant, unit commanders are charged with ensuring the Families of their fallen Soldiers are made to feel a part of the Army for as long as they desire. To that end, unitcommanders will inform Family members of the deceased Soldier about any unit memorial event that is conducted in adeployed environment and will invite the Soldier's Family to attend unit memorial events at the home station. f. Nonmilitary memorial events . Commanders may also conduct nonmilitary memorial events for deceased immedi- ate Family members of Soldiers assigned to their units to recognize the Family member's contribution to the unit andmilitary community when appropriate. \"Immediate Family members\" are defined as the Soldier's spouse, children (toinclude stepchildren), and parents (to include stepparents). g. Memorial event support . Commanders at all levels must ensure unit memorial events are conducted in recognition of the deceased Soldier's military Service and on behalf of a grateful Nation. Chapter 6 The Equal Opportunity Program in the Army 6-1.

Off-post activities, on-post activities, and off-limit actions a. Off-post activities. Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 addresses the practice of discrimination and segrega- tion in public establishments. These public establishments include privately owned establishments such as hotels,restaurants, gasoline stations, theaters, places of entertainment, and community housing (for example, apartments). Thesenior commander will ensure that the facts surrounding allegations of discriminatory practices are fully developed.The commander will also ensure those individuals and organizations alleged to practice such unlawful discriminationare given a full and fair opportunity to challenge particular allegations. If all reasonable efforts and alternatives fail toeliminate off-post discriminatory practices in public accommodations, senior commanders are authorized to place thosefacilities off-limits after requesting such action through the servicing Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board.Military personnel outside the United States are not protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 while off-post.However, the commander will take whatever actions are available and appropriate to eliminate discriminatory practicesin public accommodations outside the United States that affect Soldiers, civilians, or Family members of his/hercommand. Commanders must promote awareness of the pertinent laws of the host nation. b. Off-limits sanctions. Off-limits sanctions may be appropriate for public accommodations and establishments falsely claiming to be private clubs (fraternal or otherwise) with discriminatory policies and practices. If discriminatorypractices off-post are found to be directed at selected Soldiers in a command and efforts at conciliation proveunsuccessful, imposition of off-limits sanctions according to AR 190-24 may be appropriate. c. Off-limits sanctions and private establishments. The establishment of off-limits areas is a function of command. It may be used by commanders to help maintain the good order and discipline, health, morale, safety, and welfare ofSoldiers. A senior commander ordinarily may not apply off-limits sanctions to a bona fide private establishment, club,activity, or organization. However, such an entity may be placed off-limits if the following conditions exist: 63 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(1) It is open to military personnel in general or to Soldiers who meet specific objective criteria (such as sergeant and above) but segregates or discriminates against other Soldiers solely on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, ornational origin. (2) It is not primarily political or religious in nature.(3) The senior commander, in consultation with his/her key staff, determines that the available facts support the allegations of unlawful discrimination after affording the management of the establishment, club, activity, or organiza-tion a full and fair opportunity to challenge or refute allegations. (4) Reasonable efforts by the commander to bring about voluntary termination of the discriminatory practices are unsuccessful. (5) The commander determines that continued unlawful discrimination by the establishment, club, activity, or organization undermines the morale, discipline, or loyalty of Soldiers in the command. d. On-post activities. All on-post facilities and official activities are open, as appropriate, to all DOD personnel and Family members without regard to race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. Senior commanders are responsiblefor ensuring that an organization taking advantage of or using on-post facilities (whether on a reimbursable basis orotherwise) does not engage in unlawful discriminatory practices. It is not enough to depend solely on the publishedbylaws or the constitution of the organization. The senior commander must assess the organization's actual membershippractices and their effect upon the command. In cases where the senior commander determines that credible informa-tion of discriminatory practices by an on-post private organization has been presented, the organization has the burdenof proving it did not engage in discriminatory practices. Failure to substantiate the absence of discriminatory practiceswill result in a denial of the use of on-post facilities. However, the provisions of this paragraph do not prohibit thesenior commander from approving the operation of private organizations that restrict membership to one gender if oneor more of the following apply: (1) The private organization's purpose is philanthropic and, by tradition, its membership has been of one gender.(2) The private organization's purpose and functions is to benefit one sex, and its membership is composed of that gender (Examples are scouting organizations or women's and men's sporting associations.) (3) The private organization has a specific purpose and function that restricts membership to one gender, but also has a counterpart organization with the same purpose and function. (Examples are women's and men's sport clubs,women's and men's civic associations, and boy and girl scouting organizations.) 6-9. Procedures for processing equal opportunity complaints a. Individual rights. Soldiers, Family members, and DA civilians have the right to\u2014 (1) Present a complaint to the command without fear of intimidation, reprisal, or harassment.(2) Communicate with the commander concerning their complaints.(3) Receive assistance when submitting a complaint.(4) Receive training on the Army's EO complaint and appeals process.b. Individual responsibility. Individuals are responsible for\u2014 (1) Advising the command of any incidents of sexual harassment and unlawful discrimination complaints and providing the command an opportunity to take appropriate action to rectify/resolve the issue. (2) Submitting only legitimate complaints and exercising caution against unfounded or reckless charges.c. Individual attempts to resolve complaints. It is recommended that the individual attempt to resolve a complaint by first informing the alleged offender that the behavior must stop. d. Filing and processing equal opportunity complaints. For filing and processing of EO or sexual harassment complaints, follow the procedures outlined in appendix D. 6-10. Housing complaints Complaints of housing discrimination involving unequal treatment because of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin will be forwarded to the local housing division for processing. AR 420-1 and DA Pam 420-1-1 provide policyand procedures for housing issues. 6-11. Evaluation reports a. Entries. The performance evaluation process provides commanders and supervisors an excellent opportunity to discuss their goals, objectives, and expectations of the EO and EEO programs. In counseling session, commanders andsupervisors should discuss these programs as expressions of the Army's values and encourage support of theseprograms and how they intend to evaluate individual behaviors and actions. When evaluating officers, enlisted Soldiers,or DA civilian employees, rating officials will evaluate those individuals' commitment to the goals and objectives ofthe EO or EEO program. This includes the individuals' actions or non-actions toward the prevention and elimination ofunlawful discrimination and/or sexual harassment. Raters are required to document significant deviations from thatcommitment and identify instances of reprisal/retaliation taken by the rated individual in that evaluation report (see AR623-3). Substantiated EO complaints as a result of AR 15-6 investigation require a \"Does not support EO\" on thenoncommissioned officer evaluation report or a \"No\" in Part IV-Performance Evaluation Professionalism, A. Army 64 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Values, 5. Respect, on the officer evaluation report . This documentation may include administering appropriate administrative, disciplinary, or legal action(s) to correct offensive behavior. b. Appeals. Appeals of officer evaluation reports due to alleged unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment, or reprisal will be conducted according to the procedures specified in AR 623-3 Appeals of noncommissioned officerevaluation reports, based on allegations of unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment, or reprisal, will be submittedaccording to the procedures outlined in AR 623-3. 6-12. Civilian schooling Army personnel pursuing an educational program at an institution that unlawfully discriminates in the admission or subsequent treatment of students will not be financially assisted from appropriated fund resources. Exceptions to thispolicy will be considered when the applicant has previously attended the institution in question and will suffer personalhardship through loss of earned credits if a transfer is required. When Soldiers seek continuation of civilian schoolingwith schools barred from receiving DOD or DA funds because they discriminate in their admission practices orsubsequent treatment of students, they will request an exception to policy through command channels. 6-13. Legal assistance Within the framework of the legal assistance program, legal assistance may be provided to Soldiers who believe they have been denied federally protected rights. If the civil rights of Soldiers seem endangered and an appearance in courtor other legal action beyond the authority of the legal assistance officer is required, the matter will be reported to TheJudge Advocate General (HQDA (DAJA-CL), 2200 Army Pentagon, Washington DC 20310-2200 for possible referralto the Department of Justice (see AR 27-40)). 6-14. Equal opportunity action plans The EOAPs are planned, achievable steps that eliminate practices denying fair and equitable treatment to Soldiers and their Families, and that monitor progress toward these goals. a. Each ACOM, ASCC, DRU, installation, separate unit, agency, and activity down to and including brigade-level or equivalent will develop and implement EOAPs. The DA Pam 600-26 is the HQDA EOAP that monitors thecentralized personnel management processes for which HQDA has responsibility. Heads of staff proponent agenciesand their field operating agencies provide input to this EOAP. Unit EOAPs will be written in accordance with DA Pam600-26. b. Units will review EOAPs annually to assess the effectiveness of past actions; to initiate new actions, and to sustain, monitor, or delete goals already achieved. c. Commanders will provide a copy of their EOAP to the next higher commander. d. Affirmative Employment Plans for civilian employees will be established in accordance with AR 690-12. 6-15. Training a. Minimum criteria for local unit training programs. (1) The commander will incorporate EO training into the overall training plan for the unit.

Funding for installation special/ethnic observances will come from HQ, Installation Management Agency to the GC. Chapter 7 Prevention of Sexual Harassment 7-1. Overview POSH is a commander's responsibility. The EOA plays a pivotal role by assisting the commander with policy awareness, training, command climate assessments, complaints processing, and overall advisory assistance concerningthe POSH. 7-2. Chain of command responsibilities Commanders and supervisors will\u2014 a. Ensure that assigned personnel (to include RC personnel under their jurisdiction) are familiar with the Army policy on sexual harassment. b. Publish and post written command policy statements for the POSH. All statements will be consistent with Army policy. They will include the local command's commitment to the Army's policy against sexual harassment and willreaffirm that sexual harassment will not be tolerated. The statement will explain how and where to file complaints andwill state that all complainants will be protected from acts or threats of reprisal. Each ACOM, ASCC, DRU,installation, separate unit, agency, and activity down to company, troop, or battery level will publish a sexualharassment command policy statement. Units should coordinate these policy statements with the servicing SJA or legaladvisor before publishing them. c. Continually assess and be aware of the climate of command regarding sexual harassment. Identify problems or potential problems. Take prompt, decisive action to investigate all complaints of sexual harassment. Either resolve theproblem at the lowest possible level or, if necessary, take formal disciplinary or administrative action. Do not allowSoldiers to be retaliated against for filing complaints. Continually monitor the unit and assess sexual harassmentprevention policies and programs at all levels within area of responsibility. Ensure all leaders understand that if theywitness or otherwise know of incidents of sexual harassment, they are obligated to act. If they do not, they themselvesare also engaging in sexual harassment. d. Set the standard. 7-3. Policy a. The policy of the Army is that sexual harassment is unacceptable conduct and will not be tolerated. Army leadership at all levels will be committed to creating and maintaining an environment conducive to maximumproductivity and respect for human dignity. Sexual harassment destroys teamwork and negatively affects combatreadiness. The Army bases its success on mission accomplishment. Successful mission accomplishment can beachieved only in an environment free of sexual harassment for all personnel. b. The POSH is the responsibility of every Soldier and DA civilian. Leaders set the standard for Soldiers and DA civilians to follow. 7-4. Definition a. Sexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination that involves unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature between the same or opposite genders when\u2014 (1) Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a person's job, pay, or career. 68 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(2) Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct by a person is used as a basis for career or employment decisions affecting that person. (3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. b. Any person in a supervisory or command position who uses or condones implicit or explicit sexual behavior to control, influence, or affect the career, pay, or job of a Soldier or civilian employee is engaging in sexual harassment.Similarly, any Soldier or civilian employee who makes deliberate or repeated unwelcome verbal comments, gestures, orphysical contact of a sexual nature is engaging in sexual harassment. 7-5. Categories of sexual harassment a. Verbal. Examples of verbal sexual harassment may include telling sexual jokes; using sexually explicit profanity, threats, sexually oriented cadences, or sexual comments; whistling in a sexually suggestive manner; and describingcertain attributes of one's physical appearance in a sexual manner. Verbal sexual harassment may also include usingterms of endearment such as \"honey\", \"babe\", \"hunk\" referring to civilianco-workers, or Family members. b. Nonverbal. Examples of nonverbal sexual harassment may include staring at someone (that is, \"undressing someone with one's eyes\"), blowing kisses, winking, or licking one's lips in a suggestive manner. Nonverbal sexualharassment also includes printed material (for example, displaying sexually oriented pictures or cartoons); usingsexually oriented screen savers on one's computer; or sending sexually oriented notes, letters, faxes, or email. c. Physical contact. Examples of physical sexual harassment may include touching, patting, pinching, bumping, grabbing, cornering, or blocking a passageway; kissing; and providing unsolicited back or neck rubs. Sexual assaultand rape are extreme forms of sexual harassment and serious criminal acts. When these acts occur, report them inaccordance with the procedure outlined in chapter 8 and appendix H, of this regulation. 7-6. Types of sexual harassment a. Quid pro quo. \"Quid pro quo\" is a Latin term meaning \"this for that.\" This term refers to conditions placed on a person's career or terms of employment in return for favors. It includes implicit or explicit threats of adverse action ifthe person does not submit to such conditions and promises of favorable actions if the person does submit to suchconditions. Examples include demanding sexual favors in exchange for a promotion, award, or favorable assignment;disciplining or relieving a subordinate who refuses sexual advances; and threats of poor job evaluation for refusingsexual advances. Incidents of \"quid pro quo\" may also have a harassing effect on third persons. It may result inallegations of sexual favoritism or general discrimination when a person feels unfairly deprived of recognition,advancement, or career opportunities because of favoritism shown to another Soldier or civilian employee on the basisof a sexual relationship. An example would be a Soldier who is not recommended for promotion and who believes thathis or her squad leader recommended another Soldier in his or her squad for promotion on the basis of provided orpromised sexual favors, not upon merit or ability. b. Hostile environment. A hostile environment occurs when Soldiers or civilians are subjected to offensive, un- wanted and unsolicited comments, or behaviors of a sexual nature. If these behaviors unreasonably interfere with theirperformance, regardless of whether the harasser and the victim are in the same workplace, then the environment isclassified as hostile. A hostile environment brings the topic of sex or gender differences into the workplace in any oneof a number of forms. It does not necessarily include the more blatant acts of \"quid pro quo\"; it normally includesnonviolent, gender-biased sexual behaviors (for example, the use of derogatory gender-biased terms, comments aboutbody parts, suggestive pictures, explicit jokes, and unwanted touching). 7-7. Techniques of dealing with sexual harassment All Soldiers and civilians have a responsibility to help resolve acts of sexual harassment. Examples of how to accomplish this follows: a. Direct approach. Confront the harasser and tell them that the behavior is not appreciated, not welcomed and that it must stop. Stay focused on the behavior and its impact. Use common courtesy. Write down thoughts beforeapproaching the individual involved. b. Indirect approach. Send a letter to the harasser stating the facts, personal feelings about the inappropriate behavior and expected resolution. c. Third party. Request assistance from another person. Ask someone else to talk to the harasser, to accompany the victim, or to intervene on behalf of the victim to resolve the conflict. d. Chain of command. Report the behavior to immediate supervisor or others in chain of command and ask for assistance in resolving the situation. e. Filing a formal complaint. Details for filing an informal or formal complaint are included in appendix D. 7-8. Training The elimination of sexual harassment within a unit begins with a policy of aggressive and progressive training to 69 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014identify and prevent inappropriate behavior. Units will conduct progressive, interactive small group sexual harassment training twice each year. Soldiers must understand what sexual harassment is, how to recognize it, how to prevent it,how to report it, and the consequences of engaging in sexual harassment. a. The quality and effectiveness of unit training are of primary concern. The most effective approach to training to prevent sexual harassment is through interactive discussion in small groups of mixed gender. Situational vignettes orscenarios should be used to facilitate discussion among unit Soldiers and civilians. Role play is also an effectivetraining means. The training focus should be appropriate to the level of the experience and breadth of responsibilitiesof each target audience. Unit commanders must attend this training and evaluate its content and quality. b. Unit training for junior enlisted and civilian employees will focus on defining sexual harassment and gender discrimination, sanctions that may be used to punish harassers, techniques for Soldiers to deal with sexual harassmentand methods of filing a complaint through the complaint system. c. Unit training or professional development training for junior officers, NCOs and civilian supervisors will rein- force the aforementioned training. In addition, emphasis should be placed on promoting a healthy work environmentwithin the section or unit as well as on techniques for receiving, handling and resolving complaints. Training on theEO complaint system must include leader responsibilities in processing informal and formal complaints. It mustemphasize the prevention of reprisal actions against complainants. d. Training at unit level for senior NCOs, WOs, officers, civilian managers and senior executive service personnel will focus on fostering a healthy command climate and using appropriate means for determining a healthy commandclimate. This training will also focus on sanctions for offenders. In addition, it will reinforce the elements of trainingthey receive at a more junior level. e. Leaders may enlist the service of their brigade or higher level EOA or TC 26-6 to help prepare and conduct POSH training. f. Commanders will document POSH training on the unit's training schedule. Documentation will include type, instructor, date, time, length of training, roster of attendees, and issues covered in the session. g. The chain of command and EOAs will attend and participate in POSH sessions. 7-9. Complaints Filing and processing of sexual harassment complaints follow the same procedures as outlined in appendix D for EO complaints. Charges of sexual misconduct are to be processed through legal and/or law enforcement channels, not EOchannels. Chapter 8 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program 8-1. Purpose and goals of the program a. Purpose. The SAPR Program reinforces the Army's commitment to eliminate incidents of sexual assault through a comprehensive policy that centers on awareness and prevention, training and education, victim advocacy, response,reporting, and accountability. Army policy promotes sensitive care and confidential reporting for victims of sexualassault and accountability for those who commit these crimes. For the purposes of this policy, confidentiality orconfidential reporting is defined as allowing a Soldier to report a sexual assault to specified individuals. This reportingoption gives the Soldier access to medical care, counseling, and victim advocacy, without initiating the investigativeprocess. See appendix H for full discussion of confidentiality policy for victims of sexual assault. b. Goals. The goals of the SAPR Program are to\u2014 (1) Create a climate that minimizes sexual assault incidents, which impact Army personnel, Army civilians, and Family members, and, if an incident should occur, ensure that victims and subjects are treated according to Armypolicy. (2) Create a climate that encourages victims to report incidents of sexual assault without fear.(3) Establish sexual assault prevention training and awareness programs to educate Soldiers.(4) Ensure sensitive and comprehensive treatment to restore victims' health and Well-being.( 5 ) E n s u r e l e a d e r s u n d e r s t a n d t h e i r r o l e s a n d r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s r e g a r d i n g r e s p o n s e t o s e x u a l a s s a u l t v i c t i m s , thoroughly investigate allegations of sexual assault, and take appropriate administrative and disciplinary action. 8-2. Sexual assault policy a. Sexual assault is a criminal offense that has no place in the Army. It degrades mission readiness by devastating the Army's ability to work effectively as a team. Every Soldier who is aware of a sexual assault should immediately(within 24 hours) report incidents. Sexual assault is incompatible with Army values and is punishable under the UCMJand other Federal and local civilian laws. b. The Army will use training, education, and awareness to minimize sexual assault; to promote the sensitive 70 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014handling of victims of sexual assault; to offer victim assistance and counseling; to hold those who commit sexual assault offenses accountable; to provide confidential avenues for reporting, and to reinforce a commitment to Armyvalues. c. The Army will treat all victims of sexual assault with dignity, fairness, and respect. d. The Army will treat every reported sexual assault incident seriously by following proper guidelines. The information and circumstances of the allegations will be disclosed on a need-to-know basis only. e. This policy applies\u2014 (1) Both on and off post and during duty and non-duty hours.(2) To working, living, and recreational environments (including both on- and off-post housing). 8-3. Victim Advocacy Program Victim's use of advocacy services is optional; however, commanders must ensure that victims have access to a well- coordinated, highly responsive sexual assault Victim Advocacy Program that is available 24 hours per day/7 days perweek both in the garrison and in a deployed environment. a. There are three echelons of sexual assault victim advocates (VAs) in the Army's program in garrison\u2014 (1) The installation sexual assault response coordinator (SARC) is responsible for coordinating the local implemen- tation of the program. (2) Installation victim advocates (IVA) work directly with the installation SARC, victims of sexual assault, unit victim advocates (UVAs), and other installation response agencies. (3) The UVAs are Soldiers who are trained to provide limited victim advocacy as a collateral duty.b. In a deployed environment, there are two echelons of VAs: (1) Deployable SARC are Soldiers trained and responsible for coordinating the SAPR Program as a collateral duty in a specified area of a deployed theater. There is one deployable SARC at each brigade/unit of action and higherechelon. (2) The UVAs are Soldiers trained to provide victim advocacy as a collateral duty. There are two UVAs for each battalion-sized unit. 8-4. Definitions For the purpose of this policy\u2014 a. Sexual assault. Sexual assault is a crime defined as intentional sexual contact, characterized by use of force, physical threat or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or cannot consent. Sexual assault includes rape,nonconsensual sodomy (oral or anal sex), indecent assault (unwanted, inappropriate sexual contact or fondling), orattempts to commit these acts. Sexual assault can occur without regard to gender or spousal relationship or age ofvictim. \"Consent\" will not be deemed or construed to mean the failure by the victim to offer physical resistance.Consent is not given when a person uses force, threat of force, or coercion or when the victim is asleep, incapacitated,or unconscious. b. Other sex-related offenses. Other sex-related offenses are defined as all other sexual acts or acts in violation of the UCMJ that do not meet the above definition of sexual assault, or the definition of sexual harassment aspromulgated in DODD 1350.2. Examples of other sex-related offenses could include indecent acts with another andadultery. (For the specific articles of sexual assault offenses under the UCMJ, see the MCM. c. Restricted reporting. Restricted reporting allows a Soldier who is a sexual assault victim, on a confidential basis, to disclose the details of their assault to specifically identified individuals and receive medical treatment and counsel-ing, without triggering the official investigative process. Soldiers who are sexually assaulted and desire restrictedreporting under this policy should report the assault to the SARC, VA, chaplain, or a healthcare provider. d. Unrestricted reporting. Unrestricted reporting allows a Soldier who is sexually assaulted and desires medical treatment, counseling, and an official investigation of his/her allegation to use current reporting channels (for example,the chain of command or law enforcement), or he/she may report the incident to the SARC or the on-call VA. Uponnotification of a reported sexual assault, the SARC will immediately notify a VA. Additionally, with the victim'sconsent, the healthcare provider will conduct a forensic examination, which may include the collection of evidence.Details regarding the incident will be limited to only those personnel who have a legitimate need to know.

(21) When appropriate, consult with the victim on pretrial and charging decisions (as specified in AR 27-10).(22) As appropriate, refer the victim's Family to available resources (that is, counseling, resources, information, and medical care). (23) Follow written procedures established by senior commanders for reporting sexual assault through the chain of command. (24) Determine, in a timely manner, how to best dispose of alleged victim collateral misconduct, to include making the decision to defer the disciplinary actions regarding such misconduct until after the final disposition of the sexualassault case. Commanders and supervisors should take into account the trauma to the victim and respond appropriatelyso as to encourage reporting of sexual assault and the continued cooperation of the victim. (25) Determine if an administrative separation of the victim is in the best interests of either the Army or the victim, or both. Regardless of the reason for initiating the separation action, the victim is entitled to a full and fairconsideration of her or his military Service and particular situation. It is vital that all such separation actions and alldeterminations be consistent and appropriate, and be viewed as such. Separation actions are in accordance with AR600-8-24 and AR 635-200 for enlisted, and appropriate RC regulations. (26) When initiating an administrative separation on any Soldier, for any reason (voluntary or involuntary), include documentation in the separation packet that positively identifies the Soldier as having been, or not having been, avictim of sexual assault.

(29) Determine the best course of action for separating victims from the subject(s) during the investigation of sexual assault cases. Commanders should ensure that re-victimization does not occur. Commanders should consider thevictim's preferences and all relevant facts and circumstances of the case to determine the appropriate course of actionto avoid re-victimization. Commanders may consider transferring the victim to another unit, but they should also beaware of and consider the fact that there may be a perception that the victim's transfer from the unit is a result ofreporting the incident. Commanders may consider using DD Form 2873 (Military Protective Order (MPO)), referred to 77 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014as \"no contact orders.\" Military Protective Orders are an effective tool for commanders to maintain the safety of the victims and witnesses. If the victim lives off-post, he or she may obtain a restraining order from the civilian courts. (30) Ensure feedback on case status is provided to victims of a sexual assault. The battalion commander will update the victim 14 calendar days after the initial report. Thereafter, battalion commanders will ensure, at a minimum, amonthly update is provided to the victim (if report is unrestricted) on the current status of any ongoing investigative,medical, legal, or command proceedings regarding the assault. Monthly updates will continue until the final dispositionof the reported assault (that is, the conclusion of any judicial, non-judicial, and administrative actions (includingseparation) taken in response to the offense, whichever is later in time).

This provision does not apply to Soldiers who have a court-martial sentence that includes adishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge, or a dismissal. (35) Continually assess the command climate through various methods (for example, focus groups, surveys, talking with Soldiers). (36) Conduct periodic assessments of the SAPR Program for program improvement.(37) Comply with AR 600-8-8 and appoint same-gender sponsors for first-term Soldiers.p.

Deployable sexual assault response coordinator and unit victim advocate selection criteria Because of the sensitivity and complexity of working with sexual assault victims, the deployable SARC and UVA must be carefully selected. These Soldiers are likely to become involved in highly charged, emotionally stressful situations inassisting victims of sexual assault. As a result, all candidates must be properly screened and complete training inresponding appropriately to victims of sexual assault. Deployable SARCs and UVAs will be selected in accordancewith the following requirements: a. Be recommended by the chain of command. The first LTC or battalion level equivalent or higher commander will approve the recommendation and sign the appointment orders. b. Be deployable. c. Be able to respond to a sexual assault incident at anytime when on call. d. Have outstanding duty performance, as evidenced by a review of the individual's evaluation reports. e.

Training The objective of SAPR training is to eliminate incidents of sexual assault through a comprehensive program that focuses on awareness and prevention, education, victim advocacy, reporting, response, and follow up. There are fourcategories of training for the SAPR Program. This includes PME training, unit level training, predeployment training,and responder training. a. Professional military education. The PME training is progressive and sequential and includes the following areas: (1) Initial entry training.(2) Pre-commissioning/basic officer leadership instruction-I to include ROTC and Junior ROTC.(3) Basic officer leadership instruction II, Warrant Officer Basic Course, Primary Leadership Development Course.(4) Captain's Career Course, Warrant Officer Advanced Course, and Basic Noncommissioned Officer Course.(5) General officer training, Army War College, PCC, Warrant Officer Senior Course, Sergeants Major Course, and First Sergeant (1SG) Course. (6) Drill sergeant and recruiter training.b. Unit level training. All Soldiers will attend and participate in unit level SAPR training annually. Training will be scenario based, using real life situations to demonstrate the entire cycle of reporting, response, and accountabilityprocedures. Training should be inclusive of audience and group participation. (1) The commander will incorporate sexual assault prevention training into the overall unit training plan. Command- ers should annotate sexual assault prevention training on the unit training schedule. The training will be based on Armyvalues to promote respect and dignity and to reinforce the Army's commitment to the Warrior Ethos. The chain ofcommand and other leaders (commander, CSM, SGM, 1SG, civilian supervisors, and others) will be present andparticipate in unit sexual assault sessions. (2) SAPR Program training is not an extension of sexual harassment training. Trainers should clarify the differences between harassment and assault and identify those dynamics that are unique to sexual assault. (3) Persons conducting training must use formal training packages on the SAPR Program. Critical points to stress during unit training includes the following: (a) The Army's policy on sexual assault. (b) Definitions and examples of sexual assault (use definitions in para 8-4 of this document). (c) Resources to assist victims of sexual assault. (d) Sexual assault prevention and the appropriate responses. (e) Chain of command responsibilities for enforcing the Army's policy on sexual assault. (f) Risk factors and issues in the unit setting including deployed environments. (g) Timely reporting of sexual assault. (h) Privileged and confidential communications (restricted and unrestricted reporting). (i) Victim rights. (j) Potential first responder points of contact to initiate victim assistance include reporting a sexual assault incident to the following (asterisk indicates agencies with whom victims can initiate a restricted report): 1. Medical services.* 2. Law enforcement. 3. Chaplains.* 4. Chain of command. 5. Legal services. 6. Family Advocacy Program. 7. Equal opportunity advisor and/or program manager. 8. Sexual assault response coordinator.* 9. Installation or unit victim advocate.* c. Predeployment training. Predeployment training will incorporate information on SAPR. As part of predeployment training, Soldiers will be presented with information to increase awareness of the customs of the host country and anycoalition partners, in an effort to help prevent further sexual assaults outside of CONUS. This presentation will\u2014 (1) Ensure that Soldiers who deploy to locations outside the United States are cognizant of sexual assault issues, as well as DOD and specific Army policies about sexual assault prevention, prosecution of offenders, and the care ofvictims. This training will include risk reduction factors that are tailored to the specific deployment locations. (2) Focus on the specific foreign countries or areas anticipated for deployment. It will include customs, mores and religious practices, and a brief history of the foreign countries or areas. The cultural customs and mores of coalitionpartners will also be addressed. 82 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(3) Address procedures for reporting a sexual assault to ensure that Service members are aware of the full range of options available and have knowledge of location and contact information for response agencies in the deployedtheater. (4) Identify support systems that will be available during the deployment, to include chain of command, UVAs, deployable SARCs, healthcare providers, CID/military police, SJA, and chaplains. d. Post-deployment training. Commanders will ensure Service members receive SAPR unit refresher training during reintegration activities. e. Responder training. Primary responders to sexual assault incidents will receive the same baseline training throughout the DOD, to ensure that any Service member who is assaulted will receive the same level of responseregardless of Service component. Training should emphasize coordinating victim support services as a team effort andto be effective all the team members must be allowed to do their job and must understand the role of the others on theteam. Each responsible first responder agency listed below will implement DOD's baseline training standards (see appI for minimum baseline training standards): (1) Healthcare (responsible agency MEDCOM).(2) Law enforcement and criminal investigators (responsible agency TRADOC).(3) Judge advocate general officers (responsible agency OTJAG).(4) Chaplains (responsible agency Office of the Chief of Chaplains (OCCH)).(5) Sexual assault response coordinators (responsible agency ACSIM and/or CFSC).(6) Installation and UVAs (responsible agency ACSIM and/or CFSC). 83 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Appendix A References Section I Required PublicationsDOD regulations, directives, and instructions are available on the Web at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/; the Manual for Courts-Martial is available at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/law/mcm.pdf.

Political activities not expressly permitted or prohibited Some activities not expressly prohibited may be contrary to the spirit and intent of this policy. In determining whether an activity violates the traditional concept that military personnel should not engage in partisan political activity, rulesof reason and common sense will apply. Any activity that could be viewed as associating the Department of the Armydirectly or indirectly with a partisan political cause or candidate will be avoided. 94 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014B-5. Local nonpartisan political activities This policy does not preclude participation in local nonpartisan political campaigns, initiatives, or referendums. A Soldier taking part in local nonpartisan political activity, however, will not\u2014 a. Wear a uniform or use any Government property or facilities while participating. b. Allow participation to interfere with, or prejudice, the Soldier's performance of military duties. c. Engage in conduct that in any way may imply that the Department of the Army has taken an official position on, or is otherwise involved in, the local political campaign or issue. B-6. U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers on active duty tours The RC Soldiers on AD tour regardless of length engaging in permissible political activity will\u2014 a. Give full time and attention to the performance of military duties during prescribed duty hours. b. Avoid any outside activities that may be prejudicial to the performance of military duties or are likely to bring discredit upon the U.S. Army. c. Refrain from participating in any political activity while in military uniform, as proscribed by AR 670-1, or using Government facilities or resources. Appendix C Equal opportunity/Sexual Harassment Complaint Processing System C-1. Entering the complaints processing system The EO complaints processing system addresses complaints that allege unlawful discrimination or unfair treatment on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, and national origin. Attempts should always be made to solve the problem atthe lowest possible level within an organization. Complaints by civilian personnel alleging discrimination should behandled in accordance with the procedures contained in AR 690-600, or as described in DOD and Department of theArmy policy implementing 10 USC 1561, or as provided for in any applicable collective bargaining agreement. a. Informal complaint.(1) An informal complaint is any complaint that a Soldier or Family member does not wish to file in writing. Informal complaints may be resolved directly by the individual, with the help of another unit member, the commanderor other person in the complainant's chain of command. Typically, those issues that can be taken care of informallycan be resolved through discussion, problem identification, and clarification of the issues. An informal complaint is notsubject to time suspense. Accumulative numbers may be reported to ACOMs, ASCCs, and/or DRUs per their requeston all informal complaints resolved through commander's inquiry and/or AR 15-6 investigating officer. It is recom-mended that anyone working on the resolution of informal complaints should prepare a memorandum of record. Thememorandum of record should include information indicating nature of complaint and identifying pertinent informationto assist in the identification of unit's command climate. (2) Although the processing of EO complaints through the unit chain of command is strongly encouraged, it will not serve as the only channel available to Soldiers to resolve complaints. Should the complainant feel uncomfortable infiling a complaint with his/her unit chain of command, or should the complaint be against a member of that chain ofcommand, a number of alternative agencies exist through which the issues may be identified for resolution. Each ofthese agencies provides expertise in very specific subject areas. Commanders will not preclude Soldiers from usingthese channels in accordance with the procedures inherent/established by these agencies: (a) Someone in a higher echelon of the complainant's chain of command. (b) Inspector General. (c) Chaplain. (d) Provost Marshal. (e) Medical agency personnel. (f) Staff judge advocate. (g) Chief, Community Housing Referral and Relocation Services Office. (3) In some informal complaints, the person or agency receiving the complaint may be able to resolve the issue while maintaining the confidentiality of the complainant, as in the case of the chaplain or a lawyer. While maintenanceof confidentiality should be attempted, it will neither be guaranteed nor promised to the complainant by agencies otherthan the chaplain or a lawyer. (4) Initial actions by these alternative agencies are the same for informal and formal complaints. Any alternative agency that receives an informal complaint of unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment has the obligation to talkwith the complainant. The agency should advise the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities; listen to thecomplainant and find out as much information as possible concerning the complaint (including what the reasons arebehind the complaint and why the individual is using the alternative agency opposed to his or her chain of command);tell the complainant what role that agency has (for example, direct action on behalf of the complainant, information 95 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014gathering, or referral to another agency or the commander for their action); what support services are available from other organizations that may help resolve the issues; explain the complaint system (principally, the differences betweeninformal and formal complaints); and, then attempt to assure resolution of the issue (through mediation, intervention,counseling, and training). (5) The commander must eliminate underlying causes of all complaints. More members of the unit, other than complainant and subject, are affected by complaints, especially those that go unresolved. b. Formal complaint.(1) A formal complaint is one that a complainant files in writing and swears to the accuracy of the information. Formal complaints require specific actions, are subject to timelines, and require documentation of the actions taken. (2) An individual files a formal complaint using a DA Form 7279 (Equal Opportunity Complaint Form).(3) In Part I of DA Form 7279, the complainant will specify the alleged concern, provide the names of the parties involved and witnesses, describe the incident(s)/behavior(s), and indicate the date(s) of the occurrence(s). For EOcomplaints, the complainant will also state the EO basis of the complaint (for example, unlawful discrimination basedupon race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. Complainant will be advised of the importance of describing theincident(s) in as much detail as possible to assist in the investigative process). (4) The block entitled, \"Requested Remedy\" serves a variety of purposes for both the complainant and the command. The information in this block can vary in terms of the complainant's expectations of the investigativeprocess and his or her reasonableness and credibility. If expectations that are not likely to be met come to the surface,they should be dispelled by the receiving agency (during acceptance of the complaint) through an explanation of theprocess and the possible outcomes. If the complainant's response is vindictive, vengeful, or malicious, and seemsextreme in light of the events or circumstances, this may be helpful to the commander or investigating officer in termsof motive and believability. (5) Soldiers have 60 calendar days from the date of the alleged incident in which to file a formal complaint. This time limit is established to set reasonable parameters for the inquiry or investigation and resolution of complaints, toinclude ensuring the availability of witnesses, accurate recollection of events, and timely remedial action. If acomplaint is received after 60 calendar days, the commander may conduct an investigation into the allegations orappoint an investigating officer according to paragraph 5. In deciding whether to conduct an investigation, thecommander should consider the reason for the delay, the availability of witnesses, and whether a full and fair inquiryor investigation can be conducted. (6) The complainant should file his or her complaint with the commander at the lowest echelon of command at which the complainant may be assured of receiving a thorough, expeditious, and unbiased investigation of theallegations. Depending on the various aspects of the complaint and individuals involved, that lowest level commandermay not be the immediate company or even battalion level commander of the complainant. C-2. Actions of alternative agencies The agencies listed in this appendix also serve as alternative avenues available to Soldiers for registering formal EO complaints. Initial actions by these alternative agencies are the same for informal and formal complaints. Upon receiptof a formal EO complaint of unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment, the alternative agency has the obligation totalk with the complainant, advise him/her of his/her rights and responsibilities, find out as much information aspossible concerning the complaint (including what the reasons were for using the alternative agency and what thecomplainant's expectations might be for resolution of the complaint). The agency should also tell the complainant whatrole that agency has (action, information gathering, or referral to another agency or the commander for their action),what support services are available from other organizations, what the complaint processing procedures are (principal-ly, the differences between informal and formal complaints) and what will be done with the individual's complaint.Receipt of formal complaints by any alternative agency (except Inspector General) will be annotated in writing on theDA Form 7279, Part I, item 9. If the alternative agency decides not to do an inquiry or conduct its own investigationand decides to refer the complaint to another agency or to the appropriate commander for their investigation, thatreferral must be made within 3 calendar days (at the next multiple unit training assembly (MUTA) 4 or other regularlyscheduled training for Army Reserve TPU Soldiers). For the purposes of receiving EO complaints, any commissionedofficer is authorized to administer oaths and should do so in block 9a, DA Form 7279, prior to referring the complaintto the appropriate commander. The commander or agency receiving the referral will acknowledge receipt of thecomplaint in writing (DA Form 7279, Part I, item 11). In cases where the complaint is best resolved by the chain ofcommand, the alternative agency refers the complaint to the commander at the lowest echelon of command at whichthe complainant may be assured of receiving a thorough, expeditious, and unbiased investigation of the allegations. a. If during the course of an inquiry or investigation the receiving agency or commander identifies criminal activity, the complaint will be immediately referred to the proper agency (Provost Marshal or CID) for investigation. Refer tochapter 8 of this regulation for incidents of sexual assault. b. Allegations of unlawful discrimination in housing, both on and off post, will be referred to the housing division for processing under the provisions of AR 420-1. c. If a complaint is filed against a promotable colonel, an active or retired general officer, inspectors general of any 96 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014component, members of the Senior Executive Service, or Executive Schedule personnel, the allegation will be transferred directly to the Investigations Division, U.S. Army Inspector General Agency (SAIG-IN), Pentagon, Wash-ington, DC 20310-1700 by rapid but confidential means within 5 calendar days of receipt. C-3. Complaints filed with the Inspector General a. Complaints filed with the Inspector General will be processed as inspector general action requests, according to AR 20-1, rather than under the procedures outlined in this regulation. As such, no timelines will be imposed on theconduct of the investigation and/or on feedback to the complainant, and DA Form 7279 will not be maintained. b. Inspector General investigations are confidential and protected from unauthorized disclosure. They will include consultations with persons or activities as deemed appropriate by the Inspector General. c. Receipt of the complaint will be acknowledged to the complainant and an estimated completion date provided. If the action is not completed by that date, the complainant will be notified and given a new estimated completion date. C-4. Actions of the commander upon receipt of complaint a. Upon receipt of a complaint, the commander is required to identify and rectify sexual harassment and the five factors of unlawful discrimination, to include race, color, gender, religion and national origin. The commander willensure that the complainant has been sworn to the complaint ( DA Form 7279, block 9). If not, the commander willadminister the oath and annotate it on the complaint form. The commander will fill out block 11 acknowledging receiptof the complaint form. All formal complaints will be reported within 3 calendar days to the first General Courts-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA) in the chain of command. Additionally, the commander will provide aprogress report to the GCMCA authority 21 days after the date on which the investigation commenced and 14 daysthereafter until completion. b. The commander will either conduct an investigation personally or immediately appoint an investigating officer according to the provisions of AR 15-6. Depending on the magnitude of the complaint, the commander may deem itnecessary to ask the next SC in the chain of command to appoint the investigating officer. c. The commander will establish and implement a plan to protect the complainant, any named witnesses, and the subject from acts of reprisal. The plan will include, as a minimum, specified meetings and discussions with thecomplainant, subject, named witnesses, and selected members of the chain of command and coworkers. (1) Content of the discussions with the above named individuals will include the definition of reprisal with examples of such behavior; the Army's policy prohibiting reprisal; the complainant's rights and extent of whistleblowerprotection afforded complainants, witnesses, and the subject under DODD 7050.6; encouragement to all the aforemen-tioned individuals to report incidents and/or threats of reprisal; the procedures to report acts and/or threats of reprisal;the consequences of reprisal; possible sanctions against violators; a reminder of the roles and responsibilities of theleadership in the prevention of reprisal and protection of all parties involved; the command's support of a thorough,expeditious and unbiased investigation and good faith in attempting to resolve the complaint; and the need to treat allparties in a professional manner both during and following the conduct of the investigation. (2) Discretion will be used to determine the extent of information provided and the numbers of personnel addressed in the discussions with the chain of command and coworkers. Investigating officers will treat all those they interviewprofessionally and courteously and will limit their discussion to only those issues relating to the specific complaint. (3) To prevent the plan from becoming an administrative burden, the plan need only consist of a one-page list (in bullet format) of actions to be accomplished. The commander will annotate the names of the personnel addressed andinitial and date the actions as they are completed. The commander will provide a copy of the completed plan to theinvestigating officer and the EOA. The investigating officer will include the commander's plan to prevent reprisal as anexhibit in the investigative findings. The EOA will retain a copy of the commander's plan to prevent reprisal with thecompleted case file and use the plan to conduct follow-up assessment of the complaint. C-5. Timeliness of action Rapid resolution of EO complaints is in the best interest of both the complainant and the command. Commanders receiving a complaint involving Army Reserve or ARNG Soldiers on AD will make every attempt to resolve thecomplaint prior to the completion of the Soldiers' AD tour. If necessary, the ARNG Soldiers will remain on AD untilthe final resolution of the complaint. After receipt of the complaint, the commander to whom the complaint was givenhas 14 calendar days (or three MUTA 4 drill periods for Army Reserve TPU Soldiers) in which to conduct aninvestigation, either personally or through appointment of an investigating officer. If the complaint was referred to thecommander from an alternate agency, or if the commander refers the complaint to an alternate agency, the 14 calendardays begins from the date the complaint was referred. If, due to extenuating circumstances, it becomes impossible toconduct a complete investigation within the 14 calendar days allowed (or three MUTA 4 drill periods for ArmyReserve TPU Soldiers, that commander may obtain an extension from the next higher commander for usually not morethan 30 calendar days (or two MUTA 4 drill periods for Army Reserve TPU Soldiers. After the initial 14-day suspense,all requests for extension must be requested in writing from the next higher echelon commander. Upon receipt of anextension, the commander must inform the complainant of the extension, its duration, and the reasons for which it wasrequested. Any additional extensions must be approved in writing by the first general officer in the chain of command. 97 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Failure to adhere to prescribed timelines will result in automatic referral of the complaint to the next higher echelon commander for investigation and resolution. C-6. Conduct of the investigation a. Investigation. The purpose of any investigation of unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment is to determine to the maximum extent possible what actually occurred, to assess the validity of allegations made by the complainant, toadvise the commander of any leadership or management concerns that might contribute to perceptions of unlawfuldiscrimination and poor unit command climate, and to recommend appropriate corrective actions. The commandingofficer is responsible for ensuring the investigation is complete, thorough, and unbiased. b. Initial actions. The commander who acts as the appointing authority will provide the investigating officer a copy of orders assigning him or her as the investigating officer and the initiated DA Form 7279, which identifies thecomplainant and lists the allegations to be investigated. The investigating officer will review AR 15-6 and AR 600-20to review procedures applicable to the conduct of the investigation. Should the commander elect to investigate theallegations themselves, the procedures for investigating officer apply to the commander. c. Legal advice. The investigating officer will meet with the servicing SJA or legal advisor to review how the conduct of the investigation should be conducted under AR 15-6 and AR 600-20. The discussion should include thespecific requirements of both regulations, advice on how investigations are conducted, and advice on how to questionan interviewee who is suspected of committing a violation of the UCMJ. After the investigating officer completes theinvestigation, the packet must be submitted for legal review. d. Equal opportunity advisor assistance. The investigating officer (the commander or appointed investigating officer) will meet with the unit's EOA prior to conducting the investigation. The EOA will assist the investigatingofficer in the development of questions to be addressed to the complainant, the subject and any witnesses or thirdparties. The EOA's skills in complaint handling, conflict resolution, and training in the subtleties of discrimination andsexual harassment enable him or her to advise investigative officers in these complex areas. The EOA will ensure thefocus of the investigation is placed squarely on assessing the validity of the allegations and avoids shifting the focus ofthe investigation against the complainant. The EOA will remain available to the investigating officer for consultationand assistance throughout the conduct of the investigation. e. Conduct of interviews. The investigating officer must interview every individual who may have firsthand knowl- edge of the facts surrounding the validity of the allegations. The investigating officer must also interview everyone whocan substantiate the relationship or corroborate the relationship between the complainant and the subject. The investi-gating officer must interview the person who initially received the formal complaint, the complainant(s), any namedwitnesses, and the subject. The investigating officer should normally interview the subject after interviewing otherwitnesses, so that he or she will have a complete understanding of the alleged incident. If needed prior to theconclusion of the investigation, the investigating officer should conduct a second interview of the complainant and thesubject. The investigating officer may choose to re-interview certain witnesses for clarification of conflicting state-ments. Should unit policies or procedures be called into question as contributing factors to perceptions of unlawfuldiscrimination or hostile environment, the investigating officer will interview responsible members of the chain ofcommand. It may be advisable to interview coworkers of the complainant and the subject for knowledge they may haveabout the alleged incidents or the relationship that exists between the complainant and subject. f. Identification of criminal act. If, when interviewing any Soldier, including the subject, the investigating officer reasonably suspects that the individual has committed an offense in violation of the UCMJ, the investigating officermust advise the Soldier of his/her rights under UCMJ, Art. 31. Investigating officers should consult with their servicingjudge advocate or legal advisor before giving UCMJ, Art. 31 rights warnings, and should record the suspect's electionon DA Form 3881 (Rights Warning Procedure/Waiver Certificate). If the Soldier being questioned asks for a lawyer(that is, asserts his or her right to counsel), questioning must stop immediately and the interview must be terminated.Questioning may resume only in the presence of a lawyer, if the Soldier initiates further discussion or if the Soldier hasconsulted with a lawyer and thereafter waives his/her rights pursuant to a proper rights advisement. Similarly,questioning of a Soldier must stop immediately if a Soldier indicates the desire to remain silent. Once this right isasserted, questioning may resume only if the Soldier initiates further questioning or if after an appropriate interval, theSoldier waives his or her rights pursuant to a proper rights advisement. (See UCMJ, Art. 31, MRE 304 and 305,MCM). g. Supporting documents. The investigating officer should secure copies of any documents that might substantiate or refute the testimony of the complainant, subject, or named witnesses. These documents may include copies of unit andpersonnel records and the complainant's personal documents. The investigating officer will also procure a copy of thecommander's plan to prevent reprisal for inclusion in the final report of investigation. h. Unit climate, policies and procedures. During the course of the investigation, the investigative officer should note concerns or observations of unit policy, procedures, and individual leadership or management techniques that may havea dysfunctional effect upon unit climate and foster discriminatory behavior and/or a hostile environment. i. Investigative findings and recommendations. When the investigation is completed, the investigating officer should review the evidence, determine if the investigation adequately addresses allegations, make factual findings about whatoccurred, and provide recommendations consistent with the findings. 98 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014j. EOA review. Prior to submission of the report to the appointing authority, the investigating officer and EOA will meet and review the report. The EOA will attach a memorandum documenting his/her review. k. Investigative report. The following items are required enclosures to the report presented to the appointing authority: (1) Orders of appointment as investigating officer.(2) Copy of the DA Form 7279 with attached continuation sheets.(3) Copy of the completed/initialed commander's plan to prevent reprisal.(4) List of questions developed with EOA.(5) Statements/synopses of interviews with complainant(s), named witnesses, and subject(s) and relevant members of the chain(s) of command. (6) Copies of supporting documents.(7) Description/assessment of unit policies, procedures that may have contributed to perceptions of unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment within the unit. (8) Written approval of next higher echelon commander for any approved extensions.(9) Written explanation of extenuating circumstances that prevented the investigating officer from interviewing any named witnesses, complainants, or subjects. (10) Written review by the EOA. C-7. Actions by the appointing authority (commander) upon receipt of the report of the investigation The appointing authority will submit the report of investigation to the servicing staff or command judge advocate for a determination of legal sufficiency. After the legal review is completed, the appointing authority will decide whetherfurther investigation is necessary or whether to approve all or part of the findings and recommendations. If theappointing authority is senior to the subject's commander, the appointing authority may refer the matter to that unitcommander for appropriate action(s), unless the appointing authority or a more SC has reserved authority to take actionon EO matters. a. Actions to resolve complaints. A complaint is resolved by action to restore benefits and privileges lost because of unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment. Punitive or administrative actions against an offender do not necessarilychange offending behaviors or rectify the situation for the individual complainant or unit. Commanders will takecorrective action to preclude recurrence of discriminatory or sexually harassing conduct and address any managementdeficiencies or other contributing factors that caused the allegations to be raised. Commanders will also look at thecauses of why complainants raised unsubstantiated complaints. Actions taken (or to be taken) by the commander andthe chain of command will be annotated on DA Form 7279, Part III. Specific actions taken against the perpetrator willnot be annotated on the form. This information will be discussed with the complainant. The commander and/or EOAwill also inform the complainant and the subject(s) of the complaint of his/her right to appeal and make them aware oftimelines and procedures to file that appeal. The complainant and subject(s) will sign and date the DA Form 7279 toacknowledge receiving this information. This acknowledgment does not necessarily signify the complainant's agree-ment with the findings or actions taken to resolve the complaint. (1) Actions upon substantiated complaint(s). A substantiated EO discrimination or sexual harassment complaint is a complaint that, after the completion of an inquiry or investigation, provides evidence to indicate that the complainantwas more likely than not treated differently because of his or her race, color, national origin, gender, or religiousaffiliation. The standard of proof is a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. This means that the findings of theinvestigation must be supported by a greater weight of evidence than supports a contrary conclusion, or-in other words-evidence that, after considering everything that is presented, points to one particular conclusion as being more credibleand probable than any other conclusion. The \"weight of the evidence\" is not determined by the number of witnesses orvolume of exhibits, but by considering all the evidence and evaluating such factors as the witness's demeanor,opportunity for knowledge, information possessed, ability to recall and relate events, and other indications of veracity.When an allegation of discrimination is substantiated, that finding is annotated on the DA Form 7279, Part II. Thecommander must decide what corrective action to take. Corrective action may be administrative or punitive. (a) Administrative action. Offenders will, as a minimum, undergo counseling by a member of the chain of command, presumably their company-level commander. Commanders have the full range of administrative actionsavailable to them to deal with offenders of Army policy on EO (including the prevention/eradication of sexualharassment), to include discharge from the Service, bar to reenlistment, adverse performance evaluations and/orspecific comments concerning nonsupport of EO/EEO programs on evaluation reports, relief for cause, administrativereduction, admonition, reprimand, administrative withholding of privileges, and rehabilitative transfer to another unit.Commanders should determine whether the victim desires to be transferred to another unit, but they should not subjectthe complainant to \"double victimization\" by requiring that he or she be transferred to another unit while leaving theoffender in the unit. (b) Uniform Code of Military Justice. Violators of Army policies on EO and the prevention/eradication of sexual harassment, whose conduct violates a punitive article of the UCMJ, may be charged and prosecuted. Nonjudicialpunishments (for example, UCMJ, ART. 15) will be posted in the unit area in accordance with AR 27-10. Courts- 99 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014Martial convictions may be published in installation newspapers and/or posted in the unit area where deemed appropriate. (2) Actions upon an unsubstantiated complaint. An unsubstantiated complaint is one for which the preponderance of evidence (that is, the greater weight of evidence) does not support and verify that the alleged unlawful discriminationor sexual harassment occurred. In this situation, the commander should determine whether the allegations, thoughunsubstantiated, might be indicative of problems in the unit that require resolution through EO initiatives or otherleadership actions. Should the complaint be found unsubstantiated, the commander will notify the complainant inwriting (DA Form 7279s, Part II) and, consistent with the limitations of the Privacy Act and the Freedom ofInformation Act (FOIA), provide the complainant with a copy of the results of the investigation. The complainant willsign and date the DA Form 7279 to acknowledge receiving this information. This acknowledgment does not necessarilysignify the complainant's agreement with the actions taken. (3) Actions to resolve complaints should focus on changing inappropriate behavior of offending personnel and avoid targeting the complainant. The complainant's job and status should not be affected unless he or she requests such aremedy, and the chain of command will do so only after weighing the impact on readiness. b. Feedback. The commander will provide periodic feedback, throughout the process, to the complainant and the subject on the status of the investigation. (1) The commander will provide written feedback to the complainant not later than the 14th calendar day (by the end of the third MUTA 4 period for RCs) after receiving the complaint and then provide updates every 14 calendardays (three MUTA 4 drill periods) until final resolution. Written feedback should incorporate any verbal updatesprovided to the complainant. Written feedback will be as complete as possible consistent with limitations of the PrivacyAct and the FOIA. Whenever possible, the commander should meet with the complainant to discuss the status of theinvestigation, to include findings and actions to resolve the issue. Oral feedback should be consistent with thelimitations of the Privacy Act and the FOIA. (2) Commanders will also provide written feedback to the subject on the outcome of the investigation and subsequent actions to be taken by the chain of command. The chain of command is advised to use discretion inlimiting feedback to personnel involved. This feedback should also be consistent with the limitations of the Privacy Actand the FOIA. C-8. Appeals process If the complainant perceives the investigation failed to reveal all relevant facts to substantiate the allegations, or that the actions taken by the command on his or her behalf were insufficient to resolve the complaint, the complainant hasthe right to appeal to the next higher commander in his or her chain of command. The complainant may not appeal theaction taken against the perpetrator, if any is taken. If subject(s) of the complaint perceive the investigation has failedto reveal all relevant facts to prove his or her innocence, he or she has the right to appeal to the next highercommander in their chain of command. Geographically remote units, field operating agencies, and various otherorganizations (including tenant units on the installation) will promulgate MOU or installation standing support agree-ments between the installation (supporting) commander and their units. These documents will serve to provide thenecessary guidance to unit personnel for the courses of action to be taken with appeals. EO appeals that maypotentially leave the Army chain of command must be forwarded to DCS, G-1 (DAPE-HR-L) for resolution. a. The appeal must be presented within 7 calendar days (at the next MUTA 4 drill period for RCs) following notification of the results of investigation and acknowledgment of the actions of the command to resolve the complaint.The complainant must provide a brief statement that identifies the basis of the appeal. This will be done in writing onthe DA Form 7279, Part IV, and the complaint form will be returned to the commander in the chain of command whoeither conducted the investigation or appointed the investigating officer. b. Once the appeal is initiated by the complainant, the commander has three calendar days (or one MUTA 4 drill period for RCs) to refer the appeal to the next higher unit commander (or senior commander for those tenant units withMOU that designate an appellate authority). c. The commander to which the appeal is made has 14 calendar days (or three MUTA 4 periods for RCs) to review the case and act on the appeal (that is, approve it, deny it, or conduct an additional investigation). Not later than the14th calendar day following receipt of the appeal (or appropriate RC timelines), this commander will provide writtenfeedback, consistent with Privacy Act and FOIA limitations, to the complainant on the results of the appeal. Thisprocess applies equally to subsequent appeals submitted through the chain of command. C-9. Final resolution upon appeal Complaints that are not resolved at brigade level may be appealed to the General Courts-Martial Convening Authority. The only exception to this is where organizations have MOUs or support that delegate UCMJ authority to a localcommander. Decisions at this level are final. C-10. Follow-up assessment The EOA will conduct a follow-up assessment of all formal EO and sexual harassment complaints, both for substanti- ated and unsubstantiated complaints, 30 to 45 calendar days (four to six MUTA 4 drill periods for RCs) following the 100 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014final decision rendered on the complaint. The purpose of the assessment is to measure the effectiveness of the actions taken and to detect and deter any acts or threats of reprisal. The EOA will also assess the complainant's satisfactionwith the procedures followed in the complaint process to include timeliness, staff responsiveness and helpfulness, andresolution of the complaint. The findings of this assessment will be annotated on DA Form 7279-1 (Equal OpportunityComplaint Resolution Assessment) and maintained by the EOA. The EOA will present findings and recommendationsto the commander for further consideration/action within 15 calendar days (second MUTA 4 drill period for RCs).After the commander reviews the EOA findings and recommendation, the assessment is attached to the originalcomplaint and maintained with the rest of the file. DA Form 7279-1 is available on the APD Web site. C-11. Documentation and/or reporting of formal complaints a. After the complainant's case is closed, the entire complaint packet will be filed by the EOA who is the first in the complainant's chain of command. b. The EOA retains the complaint file. Complaints will be retained on file for 2 years from the date of the final decision on the case, using the Army Record Information Management System. c. In addition to the completed DA Forms 7279 and DA Form 7279-1, the EOA will retain the following information (using the memorandum for record format) for each case: (1) The name, rank, and organization of the individual who conducted the inquiry/investigation;(2) Complete report of investigation to include written review by EOA and servicing SJA; and,(3) The status or results of any judicial action, nonjudicial punishment, or other action taken to resolve the case.d. The commander processing the complaint involving ARNG Soldiers will send an information copy of the information in paragraph c to NGB-EO within 30 days. C-12. Actions against Soldiers submitting false complaints Soldiers who knowingly submit a false EO complaint (a complaint containing information or allegations that the complainant knew to be false) may be punished under the UCMJ. C-13. Complaint procedures for Army Reserve Soldiers serving in the individual ready reserve or those Soldiers not assigned to a unit a. Complaint filed during active duty tour. Complaint procedures will remain the same as for AD personnel. Active and reserve Army commanders, upon receiving a complaint from members of the IRR or Individual MobilizationAugmentee, from Soldiers performing AD for special work or temporary tour of AD, or from any reservist who is nota member of a TPU, will make every attempt to resolve the complaint prior to the completion of the Soldier's AD tour. (1) Timelines. Should the complaint be filed but not resolved prior to the Soldier's release from active duty, the timelines will be modified. The AA or RC commander will have 30 calendar days from the filing of the complaint tonotify the complainant of the results of the investigation/actions taken to resolve the complaint. (2) Appeals. The complainant and subject(s) of the complaint will have 30 calendar days from notification of the results of the investigation to file an appeal. Appeals filed more than 30 calendar days after notification must beaccompanied by a written explanation of the reasons for delay. The commander has the discretion to consider an appealbased on its merits. (3) Final decision. Notification of the commander's final decision will be provided to the complainant and subject(s) of the complaint with information copies to the next higher headquarters and HRC within 30 calendar days of thereceipt of the appeal. b. Complaint filed subsequent to release from active duty. In the event the complaint is filed after the AD tour has ended, the complainant will file a sworn complaint on DA Form 7279 (Part I through item 9) to the HRC EOA.(Soldiers may contact the HRC EO office for this form at Commander, HRC (ARPC-ZEQ), 9700 Page Boulevard, St.Louis, MO 63132-5200.) Upon the receipt of DA Form 7279, HRC will forward the complaint to the appropriatecommander of the subject(s) of the complaint AD unit for investigation. (1) Timelines. That commander will have 30 calendar days from date of receipt of the complaint to conduct an investigation and to provide feedback to the complainant. (Extensions, not to exceed an additional 45 calendar days,may be granted by higher echelon commander.) (2) Appeals. Complainants and subject(s) of the complaint will have 30 calendar days from notification of the results of investigation/to appeal/decline appeal. Appeals filed more than 30 calendar days after notification must be accompa-nied by a written explanation of the reasons for delay. The commander has the discretion to consider an appeal basedon its merits. (3) Final notification. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of appeal, the commander will provide notification of final decision to the complainant and subject(s) of the complaint, next higher headquarters, and HRC. C-14. Complaint procedures for Army National Guard Soldiers While on AD for 30 days or more, ARNG Soldiers will follow the complaint procedure outlined in this regulation. In 101 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014all other cases, ARNG Soldiers will follow the complaints procedures outlined in National Guard Regulation (NGR) 600-22. a. Jurisdiction. The responsibility for processing the complaint belongs to the commander at the lowest echelon of the subject's chain of command that can assure a thorough, expeditious, and unbiased investigation of the allegations. b. Complaints involving ARNG Soldiers filed, but not resolved, during an AD tour. If the duty status changes for the subject of an unresolved complaint, the commander with UCMJ or equivalent authority over the subject willreceive the complaint and complete the processing of the complaint. c. Complaints filed after release from AD. An ARNG Soldier may file a complaint with the State Equal Employ- ment Manager based upon unlawful discrimination that occurred while the Soldier was on AD. The complaint must befiled within 180 calendar days of the date of the alleged unlawful discrimination or of the time that the Soldier knew orreasonably should have known of the unlawful discrimination. (1) If both the complainant and the subject are ARNG, follow NGR 600-22 to coordinate with the appropriate National Guard agency representative for processing. (2) If the subject is from a different component or branch of the Service than the complainant, contact the senior EO office of the subject's component or branch of the Service to determine the appropriate jurisdiction with the purview toremedy. d. Commanders processing a complaint involving an ARNG Soldier will send an information copy of the completed complaint to NGB-EO-CR within 30 days as per paragraph C-11 d. Appendix D Command Climate Survey D-1. Requirement a. Company level commanders (or equivalents) will administer the command climate survey within 30 days of assuming command (120 days for the ARNG and USAR), again at 6 months, and annually thereafter. At theirdiscretion, company level commanders (or equivalents) may administer the command climate survey more often andmay supplement the survey with data from other surveys, focus groups, and interviews to assess the unit climate. b. The survey is voluntary for commanders (or equivalents) above the company level. Because the initial survey is administered shortly after a change of command, the results should not be seen as a reflection on the new commander(or equivalent), but simply as a starting point for assessing and improving the unit's command climate. D-2. Confidentiality Survey responses will be treated as confidential. Exceptions to confidentiality will be consistent with the Privacy Act Statement (that is, respondent statements about being a threat to themselves or others, comments involving criminalbehavior, and/or operationally sensitive information). When paper and pencil format is used, the unit will ensure thatrespondents can submit their survey in an inconspicuous location. Survey results will never be reported so that anindividual's responses can be identified. Only subgroups containing at least five individuals will be reported. Resultsare intended for the company commander's use and are not reported up the chain of command. Commanders mustprovide timely feedback to the unit. D-3. Compliance After the company commander has administered and analyzed the command climate survey and has developed action plans, the brigade EOA, will note completion in the brigade QNSR. Completion of the command climate survey is anitem that is checked under the CIP. D-4. Role of the equal opportunity advisor The EOA role is to discuss assessment results with the commander to aid in developing action plans. Results are best when the commander takes a proactive role in analyzing data and planning for unit improvements. D-5. Commander's training module Command Policy (AR 600-20) requires commanders of company-size units to conduct the \"Command Climate Survey\" as a tool for reviewing the climate factors (for example, leadership, cohesion, morale) that affect their unit'seffectiveness. This Training Module is designed to help commanders prepare to conduct a survey, read and interpretsurvey results, develop action plans based on survey findings, and conduct feedback sessions. Additionally, TrainingCircular (TC) 26-6 provides useful information on conducting a climate assessment and using the command climatesurvey. D-6. Anonymity Survey results are anonymous and the privacy of individuals submitting a survey will always be protected. Personnel 102 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014administering the survey and/or collecting the data should make sure procedures are in place to protect the anonymity of respondents and the confidentiality of the results. Exceptions to confidentiality and anonymity will be consistentwith the Privacy Act Statement of the survey (that is, respondent statements about being a threat to themselves orothers, comments involving criminal behavior, and operationally sensitive information). Personally identifiable infor-mation such as name, email address, or social security number should never be requested or collected. When a racial,ethnic, gender, or other demographic group consists of fewer than five members, results for that group will not bebroken out. For example, if a unit has only four females, results for females will not be separated from the males. D-7. Controls Key internal controls will be developed and published in the next revision of this publication. Appendix E The Sexual Assault Review Board E-1. Purpose This appendix prescribes mission, responsibilities, procedures and policies pertaining to installation level sexual assault review boards (SARB) at garrison installations and deployed environments. In a deployed environment, the SARB willbe convened at brigade or higher level as appropriate and follow the same format as the installation SARB. E-2. Mission The SARB provides executive oversight, procedural guidance and feedback concerning the installation's SAPR program. This board reviews the installations prevention program and the response to any sexual assault incidentsoccurring at the installation. This includes reviewing cases and procedures to improve processes, system accountabilityand victim access to quality services. E-3. Sexual assault review board composition a. The senior commander (senior mission commander, regional readiness commander, or state Joint Forces Head- quarters level commander) is responsible for the SARB and will convene this multidisciplinary board on a monthlybasis. The installation's SARC is a required member of this board. b. The SARB will consist of the following military or civilian professionals: (1) SARC.(2) Victim advocate (as appropriate when their case is being discussed and when deemed necessary by the senior commander). ( 3 ) A r m y C r i m i n a l I n v e s t i g a t i o n C o m m a n d ( o r o t h e r S e r v i c e m i l i t a r y c r i m i n a l i n v e s t i g a t i v e o r g a n i z a t i o n , i f required). (4) Staff judge advocate or representative.(5) Provost Marshal or representative, law enforcement (military or civilian police services).(6) Chaplain or representative.(7) Sexual assault clinical provider or sexual assault care coordinator.(8) Chief, Behavioral Health.(9) Other members may be appointed by nature of their responsibilities as they pertain to sexual assault (for example, victim witness liaisons, Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program representative).

The senior commander or designated representative will chair the SARB and will\u2014 (1) Convene SARB meetings at least monthly to review sexual assault cases.(2) Provide SARB findings through the appropriate command channels noting deficiencies in the installation processes and procedures for preventing or responding to sexual assault. (3) Implement process improvements to ensure system accountability and an effective victim services program.(4) Ensure that the installation's multi-disciplinary SAPR service providers are receiving appropriate training and have the necessary resources to do the job. (5) Facilitate monthly victim updates.(6) Maintain the integrity of confidential cases (that is, do not discuss any identifying information rather use case numbers or other non-identifying data). b. The SARB members will\u2014 (1) Perform required functional tasks as designated by the appropriate regulations and as directed by the senior commander. 103 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(2) Conduct ongoing reviews of current procedures for each alleged sexual assault case for compliance with regulations, local policies and in keeping with the accepted high standards of victim care. (3) Meet at least monthly to review the handling and disposition of all alleged sexual assault cases. Provide recommendations to the SARB on ways to improve the processing of sexual assault cases. (4) Participate in training as required. Determine SAPR training needs of your agency by monitoring each alleged sexual assault incident. Identify training requirements to the SARB. (5) Conduct ongoing reviews of MOA with other Services and civilian agencies regarding SAPR support. Provide updates to the SARB and recommendations for improvements as necessary. Appendix F Army Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Sexual Assault Victim Assistance Actions F-1. Responsibility for actions after a report of sexual assault Although the commander has significant leadership responsibility for actions after a report of sexual assault, not necessarily all of the actions listed in paragraph F-2 will be taken by the commander. F-2. Actions to be taken in the event of receiving a report of sexual assault The actions in the following list are to be taken in the event of receiving a report of sexual assault: a. Ensure the physical safety of the victim-determine if the alleged assailant is still nearby and if the victim needs protection. b. Advise the victim of the need to preserve evidence (for example, by not bathing, showering, washing garments). c. Encourage the victim to report the incident and get a medical examination immediately (even if the incident occurred prior to the past 72 hours). d. Make appropriate administrative and logistical coordination for movement of victim to receive care. (Involve the minimum number of personnel possible and only on a need-to-know basis). e. Ask if the victim needs a support person (for example, a personal friend, VA, chaplain) to immediately join the victim. f. Notify the SARC. g. Notify the Chaplain if the victim requests pastoral counseling or assistance. h. Notify the Criminal Investigation Command, military police, installation provost marshal (see AR 195-1), and commanders in the chain of command (as appropriate) within 24 hours (as soon as the victim's safety is establishedand victim's medical treatment procedures are in motion) and\u2014 (1) Limit the details regarding the incident to only those personnel who have a legitimate need to know.(2) Take action to safeguard the victim from any formal or informal investigative interviews or inquiries, except by those personnel who may have a \"need to know\", including but not limited to, the Criminal Investigation Commandinvestigator(s) and the trial counsel. (3) Collect only the necessary information (for example, victim's identity, location and time of the incident, name and/or description of offender(s)). Do not ask detailed questions and/or pressure the victim for responses. i. Ensure the victim is made aware of, and encouraged to exercise, their options during each phase of the medical, investigative, and legal processes. j. Ensure the CID notifies victims and witnesses of their rights through a completed Victims and Witnesses of Crime form, DD Form 2701. (See AR 27-10). k. Inform the victim of the resources in theater that are available through the Victim and Witness Assistance Program (AR 27-10). Also, inform the victim of resources accessible from anywhere in the world (that is, MilitaryOne Source emotional support to the victim, including\u2014 (1) Throughout the investigation, consult with the victim and, to the extent practicable, accommodate the victim's wishes, as long as a full and complete investigation is not compromised. (2) Listen/engage in quiet support of the victim, as needed. Be available in the weeks and months following the sexual assault, and ensure the victim that she/he can rely on the commander's support. (3) Emphasize to the victim the availability of additional avenues of support; refer to available counseling groups and other victim services. (4) Confer with the commander's legal representative and/or servicing SJA office to consider legal options, respon- sibilities (for example, pretrial restraint, military protective order), and appropriate disposition of the alleged offense. 104 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(5) If the subject is a foreign national or from a coalition force, confer with SJA on responsibilities, options, and victims rights (in theater). (6) Determine the best courses of action for separating the victim and the subject during the investigation.(a) Determine whether the victim desires to be transferred to another unit. (b) Determine if the suspect needs/desires to be transferred to another unit. (c) Consider whether a Military Protection Order (MPO) (DD Form 2873), referred to as \"no contact order,\" is appropriate. (d) Coordinate with sexual assault response agencies and the chain of command (involve as few people as possible and only on a need to know basis, protecting the victim's privacy) to determine if the victim's condition warrantsredeployment or reassignment until there is a final legal disposition of the sexual assault case and/or the victim is nolonger in danger. (e) To the extent practicable, preferential consideration related to the reassignment should be based on the victim's desires. m. Flag (suspend favorable personnel actions) any Soldier under charges, restraint, or investigation for sexual assault in accordance with AR 600-8-2 (Suspension of Favorable Actions), and suspend the Soldier's security clearance inaccordance with AR 380-67, The Department of the Army Personnel Security Program. n. Avoid automatic suspension or revocation of the victim's security and/or personnel reliability program clearance, when possible, as the victim can be treated for their related trauma. Consider the negative impact that suspension of avictim's security clearance has on both the victim's sensitivity and the service climate for reporting. Commandersshould consider making this decision in consultation with a credentialed behavioral health professional. o. Determine how to best dispose of the victim's collateral misconduct. Absent overriding considerations, command- ers should consider exercising their authority in appropriate cases to defer disciplinary actions for the victim'smisconduct until after the final disposition of the sexual assault case. p. Update the battalion or higher-level commander on the status of the victim and subject(s) within 14 calendar days, and on a monthly basis thereafter, until the case is officially closed. If the victim or subject is transferred orredeployed prior to the case closing, coordinate with investigative and SJA personnel before ceasing monthly updateson parties involved. q. Update the victim on a monthly basis on the sexual assault investigation until its final disposition. Furthermore, initiate follow-up with the victim within 45 days after disposition of the case. r. Consult with the servicing legal office, criminal investigative organization, and notify the assigned VA prior to taking any administrative action affecting the victim. s. Ensure unit personnel are abreast of risk factors associated with sexual assault, especially those risk factors unique to the deployed environment. Appendix G Confidentiality/Restricted Reporting G-1. Purpose This appendix establishes the Army's guidelines for restricted and unrestricted reporting by victims of sexual assault. G-2. Mission The Army is committed to ensuring victims of sexual assault are protected, treated with dignity and respect, and provided support, advocacy and care. Army policy strongly supports effective command awareness and preventionprograms, and law enforcement and criminal justice activities that will maximize accountability and prosecution ofsexual assault perpetrators. To achieve these dual objectives, the Army prefers complete reporting of sexual assaults toactivate both victims' services and accountability actions. However, recognizing that a mandate of complete reportingmay represent a barrier for victims to access services when the victim desires no command or law enforcementinvolvement, there is a need to provide an option for confidential reporting. G-3. Commander's responsibility Assuring privacy and providing a confidential disclosure option for sexual assault victims is critical to discharging our commitment. Sexual assault is the most under reported violent crime in our society and in the military. Although thevictim's decision to report is a crucial step following a sexual assault, reporting is often precluded by the victim'sdesire for no one to know what happened. Commanders have a responsibility to ensure community safety and dueprocess of law, but they must also recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of victims under their command.Subject matter experts agree that a system that promotes privacy/confidentiality can have a positive impact in bringingvictims forward to provide information about being assaulted. 105 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014G-4. Confidential reporting Confidentiality or confidential reporting allows a uniformed Service member to report a sexual assault to specified individuals. Confidential reporting consists of two components: restricted and unrestricted reporting. a. Restricted reporting. A Soldier who is sexually assaulted and desires medical care, counseling and victim advocacy, without initiating the investigative process should use the restrictive reporting option. Restricted reportingallows a sexual assault victim to confidentially disclose the details of his/her assault to specifically identified individu-als and receive medical treatment and counseling, without triggering the official investigative process. Restrictedreporting is intended to give victims additional time and increased control over the release and management of theirpersonal information, and to empower them to seek relevant information and support to make more informed decisionsabout participating in the criminal investigation. A victim who receives appropriate care and treatment, and is providedan opportunity to make an informed decision about a criminal investigation is more likely to develop increased trustthat his/her needs are of primary concern to the command and may eventually decide to pursue an investigation. Evenif the victim chooses not to pursue an official investigation, this additional reporting avenue gives commanders aclearer picture of the sexual violence within their command, and enhances a commander's ability to provide anenvironment that is safe and contributes to the Well-being and mission-readiness of all of its members. Restrictedreporting procedures follow: (1) Soldiers who are sexually assaulted and desire restricted reporting under this policy should report the assault to the SARC, a VA, or a healthcare provider. (2) Consistent with current policy, Soldiers may also report the assault to a chaplain. This policy on restricted reporting is in addition to the current protections afforded privileged communications with a chaplain, and does notalter or affect those protections. (3) Upon notification of a reported sexual assault, the SARC will immediately assign an IVA or UVA.(4) The assigned VA will provide the victim accurate information on the process to include the process of restricted vice unrestricted reporting. (5) The SARC or VA will ensure the victim acknowledges in writing his or her understanding that restricted reporting may limit the ability of the Government to prosecute the assailant, restrict the Army's ability to provideadequate measures to limit contact between the victim and the assailant, and an understanding of the reasons Armypolicy favors unrestricted reporting. (6) Healthcare providers will, with the consent of the victim, initiate the appropriate care and treatment, and report the sexual assault to the SARC in lieu of reporting the assault to law enforcement or the chain of command.Additionally, at the victim's discretion/request, the healthcare provider, if appropriately trained and supervised, willconduct a forensic medical examination, which may include the collection of evidence. Disposition instructions forsuch evidence are provided in appendix J. (7) If a DOD healthcare provider is not available, the victim will be appropriately referred to a civilian provider for the forensic examination, if the victim requests such a forensic examination. b. Unrestricted reporting. A Soldier who is sexually assaulted and desires medical treatment, counseling and an official investigation of his/her allegation should use current reporting channels, for example, chain of command, lawenforcement or report the incident to the SARC. Upon notification of a reported sexual assault, the SARC willimmediately assign a VA. Healthcare providers will, with the consent of the victim, initiate the appropriate care andtreatment, and report the sexual assault to law enforcement or the chain of command. Additionally, at the victim'sdiscretion/request, the healthcare provider will conduct a forensic medical examination, which may include thecollection of evidence. Details regarding the incident will be limited to only those personnel who have a legitimateneed to know. G-5. Confidential communication a. Regardless of whether the Soldier elects restricted or unrestricted reporting, confidentiality of medical information will be maintained in accordance with current guidelines on the HIPAA. b. In cases where a victim elects restricted reporting, the SARC, assigned VA (whether uniformed or civilian), and healthcare providers may not disclose covered communications to law enforcement or command authorities, eitherwithin or outside the DOD, except as provided in the exceptions below. c. Covered communications are oral, written, or electronic communications of personally identifiable information made by a victim to the SARC, assigned VA or to a healthcare provider related to their sexual assault. d. For purposes of public safety and command responsibility, the SARC is responsible for reporting information concerning sexual assault incidents, without information that could reasonably lead to personal identification of thevictim, to installation command officials within 24 hours of the incident. e. In the event that information about a sexual assault is disclosed to the commander from a source independent of the restricted reporting avenues, or to law enforcement from other sources, the commander will report the matter to lawenforcement and law enforcement remains authorized to initiate its own independent investigation of the matterpresented. Additionally, a victim's disclosure of his/her sexual assault to persons outside the protective sphere of thepersons covered by this policy may result in an investigation of the allegations. 106 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014f. This policy does not create any actionable rights for the alleged offender or the victim, nor constitute a grant of immunity for any actionable conduct by the offender or the victim. Covered communications that have been disclosedmay be used in disciplinary proceedings against the offender or the victim, even if such communications wereimproperly disclosed. g. Improper disclosure of covered communications, improper release of medical information, and other violations of this policy are prohibited and may result in discipline under the UCMJ, loss of credentials, or other adverse personnelor administrative actions G-6. Exceptions to confidentiality a. In cases in which victims elect restricted reporting, the prohibition on disclosing covered communications is waived to the following persons or entities when disclosure would be for the following reasons: (1) Command officials or law enforcement when disclosure is authorized by the victim in writing.(2) Command officials or law enforcement when disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of victim or another. (3) Disability retirement boards and officials when disclosure by a healthcare provider is required for fitness for duty for disability retirement determinations, limited to only that information that is necessary to process disability retire-ment determination. (4) SARC, VAs, or healthcare provider when disclosure is required for the supervision of direct victim services.(5) Military or civilian courts of competent jurisdiction when disclosure is ordered by or is required by Federal or state statute. SARC, VAs, and healthcare providers will consult with the servicing legal office in the same manner asother recipients of privileged information to determine if the criteria apply and they have a duty to obey. Until thosedeterminations are made, only non-identifying information should be disclosed. b. Healthcare providers may convey to the command any possible adverse duty impact related to the victim's medical condition and prognosis in accordance with DOD 6025.18-R. Such circumstances however, do not otherwisewarrant an exception to policy, and therefore the specific details of the sexual assault will still be treated as coveredcommunication and may not be disclosed. G-7. Covered communication a. Improper disclosure of covered communications, improper release of medical information, and other violations of this policy are prohibited and may result in discipline under the UCMJ, loss of credentials, or other adverse personnelor administrative actions. b. In the event that information about a sexual assault is disclosed to the commander from a source independent of the restricted reporting avenues, or to law enforcement from other sources, the commander may report the matter tolaw enforcement and law enforcement remains authorized to initiate its own independent investigation of the matterpresented. Additionally, a victim's disclosure of his/her sexual assault to persons outside the protective sphere of thepersons covered by this policy may result in an investigation of the allegations. c. This policy does not create any actionable rights for the alleged offender or the victim, nor constitute a grant of immunity for any actionable conduct by the offender or the victim. Covered communications that have been disclosedmay be used in disciplinary proceedings against the offender or the victim, even if such communications wereimproperly disclosed. d. The Army recognizes the potential impact of restricted reporting on investigations and the commander's ability to hold perpetrators accountable, and this policy decision represents the judgment that such risks have been carefullyconsidered but were outweighed by the overall interest in providing sexual assault victims this form of support. Thispolicy supersedes all regulatory and policy guidance within the Department of Army not expressly mandated by lawthat is inconsistent with its provisions, or would preclude execution. Appendix H Essential Training Tasks for a Sexual Assault Response Capability H-1. Purpose This appendix establishes mandatory baseline training standards for sexual assault response groups. These DOD standards will ensure that any Service member who is assaulted will receive the same level of response regardless ofhis or her particular military Service. Responder groups are composed of personnel in the following disciplines orpositions: a. Sexual assault response coordinators. b. Victim advocates. c. Healthcare. d.

Purpose Medical services offered to victims of sexual assault include the option to elect a SAFE in addition to the general medical care related to sexual assault response. The SAFE is an examination of a sexual assault victim by a health careprovider (HCP), who, ideally, has specialized education and clinical experience in the collection of forensic evidenceand treatment of these victims. The forensic component includes gathering information from the victim for the medicalforensic history, an examination, documentation of biological and physical findings, collection of evidence from thevictim, and follow-up as needed to document additional evidence. I-2. Process The process for collecting and preserving sexual assault evidence under the restricted reporting option is the same as takes place under the unrestricted reporting option, except that the restricted reporting option does not trigger theofficial investigative process and any evidence collected has to be documented in a way that ensures the confidentialityof a victim's identity. I-3. Procedures Restricted reporting allows a victim of sexual assault who is a Soldier to disclose on a requested confidential basis, the details of his or her assault to specifically identified individuals and receive medical treatment and counseling; this mayinclude a SAFE at the victim's request. a. If requested by the victim, a SAFE will be conducted by the appropriate HCP. The SAFE exam is the victim's option as are other general medical services related to the sexual assault. (1) Sexual assault reporting procedures require that the SARC be notified of all incidents of reported sexual assault. The SARC, in turn, will assign a VA to assist the victim. (2) If a victim initially seeks assistance at a medical facility, SARC notification must not delay the treatment of any medical conditions requiring immediate attention for the health of a victim. (3) Once any emergent medical injuries have been treated, the SARC or VA will\u2014(a) Advise the victim of the reporting options available to them. (b) Explain the benefits and limitations of each option, especially the impact of any state mandatory reporting laws on restricted reporting. (c) Document the reporting option the victim selects using DD Form 2910 (Victim Reporting Preference Statement). (4) The SARC or VA will inform the victim about the availability of an optional SAFE. If a victim chooses to undergo a SAFE, and the HCP determines a SAFE is indicated by the facts of the case, the HCP at military facilitiesthat possess a SAFE capability will conduct the examination. b. Installation commanders, senior mission commanders, Joint Force Headquarters commanders, and geographically dispersed unit commanders who do not have a military treatment facility with SAFE capability will arrange transporta-tion for the victim to and from a military facility or local off-base, non-military facility that has a SAFE capability.Commanders may also contract with a local sexual assault nurse examiner or other HCPs who are trained andcredentialed to perform a SAFE, and have them report to the MTF to conduct the examination. (1) Whenever possible, military installations should have a formal MOU in place between military facilities and off- base, nonmilitary facilities for the purpose of conducting a SAFE. (2) Geographically dispersed units and RCs will pursue through coordination or formal agreements a SAFE option for victims with supporting installation medical treatment facilities, civilian facilities, or local sexual assault nurseexaminer who are trained and credentialed to perform a SAFE. (3) The SARC or VA will ensure that the victim is aware of any local or state mandatory sexual assault reporting requirements that may limit the possibility of restricted reporting prior to proceeding with the SAFE at the off-base,non-military facility. c. For restricted reporting cases, the SARC will generate an alphanumeric restricted reporting control number (RRCN), unique to each incident that will be used in lieu of personal-identifying information, to label and identify thepotential evidence collected from a SAFE (for example, SAFE kit, accompanying documentation and personal effects,and clothing as appropriate). The following will also be done: (1) Upon completion of the SAFE, the HCP will package, seal, and label the potential evidence container(s) with the RRCN and notify the supporting provost marshal. (2) The provost marshal will be trained and capable of collecting and preserving evidence, to assume custody of the evidence, using established chain of custody procedures. (3) The MOA and MOU with off-base, nonmilitary facilities should include instructions for the notification of a SARC regardless of whether a restricted or unrestricted report of sexual assault is involved, evidence receipt proce-dures, application of an RRCN, and disposition of evidence back to the supporting provost marshal. 112 AR 600-20 \u0081 6 November 2014(4) The RRCN and general description of the potential evidence will be entered into a log to be maintained by the provost marshal. (5) Evidence will be stored for 1 year from the date of the victim's restricted report of the sexual assault.(6) At least 30 days prior to the expiration of the 1-year storage period, the supporting provost marshal will notify the appropriate SARC that the 1-year storage period is about to expire. Accordingly, the SARC will ensure notificationto the victim. (7) If the victim desires to recover any of their personal effects, the SARC will retrieve the items from the provost marshal and return them to the victim. (8) If the victim does not desire to change from a restricted report to an unrestricted report, and does not request the return of any personal effects or clothing maintained as part of the evidence prior to the expiration of the 1-year storageperiod, as outlined in AR 195-5, the provost marshal will destroy the evidence maintained under that victim's RRCN. (9) The potential evidence will similarly be destroyed if, at the expiration of 1-year, a victim does not advise the SARC of their decision, or the SARC is unable to notify a victim because the victim's whereabouts are no longerknown. (10) If, prior to the 1-year period, a victim changes their reporting preference to the unrestricted reporting option, the SARC will notify the military criminal investigative organizations (usually USACIDC), who will then assumecustody of the potential evidence maintained by the RRCN from the provost marshal under established chain ofcustody procedures. (11) Victims may request the retrieval of items of potential evidence at any time, through their supporting SARC. In that event, the SARC will be required to counsel the victim that the release of the items back to the victim couldseriously impede or make impossible the prosecution of their case. (12) Established procedures for documenting, maintaining, and storing the potential evidence will be followed in accordance with AR 195-5. Appendix J Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Assessment J-1. Scope The Army Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program assessment policy provides a unifying assessment framework whose purpose is to document requirements for capturing feedback as to how well the Army is implement-ing its SAPR Program and provide insight as to where Army program improvements can be made. a.
