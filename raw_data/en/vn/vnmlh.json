We suggest that several clinicalsituations, including autoimmunity and certain infectious diseases, can be influencedby the antigen-specic tolerogenic role of DCs. INTRODUCTION The subject of this review, dendritic cells (DCs) in T cell tolerance, may seem surprising. Prior research has emphasized the opposite outcome of DC function:stronginnateandadaptiveimmunitytoinfectionsandotherantigensinvivo(1-6).However, these two apparently incompatible functions can be reconciled in anumber of ways.

Infection stimulates DCs to coordinate many protective functions by immune cells, and these have been documented in vivo. Microbial products trigger DCstoproducelargeamountsofimmuneenhancingcytokines,suchasinterleukin-12(IL-12)(7)andinterferon- (IFN-)(8).DCsexposedtoinflammatorycytokines rapidly activate other innate protective cells such as natural killer (NK) (9) andNKTcells(10).MatureDCsinitiateorprimeTcellresponses(11,12),includingprotective immunity to infection (13) and tumors (14). Furthermore DCs are ableto rapidly polarize the immune response to either Th1 or Th2 types (15-17) andto improve T cell memory (18,19). These functions in the control of innate and adaptive immunity require that DCsundergoterminaldifferentiationormaturation.Maturationisinducedbynu-merousagentsincludingmicrobialinfection.Invivo,twomajorreceptorfamiliesplayprominentroles:toll-likereceptors(20-22)andtumornecrosisfactor(TNF)-receptors,especiallyCD40(23-25).Likewiseinvitro,DCsarematuredbyexpo-suretolipopolysaccharide(26),inflammatorycytokinesincludingTNF (27,28), andCD40ligation(29-31).MaturationresultsinseveralphenotypicchangesthatarelinkedtoanenhancedabilitytoprocessantigensandactivateTcells.Thesephe-notypic changes include increased production of MHC-peptide complexes (32),increased expression of T cell binding and costimulatory molecules (29,33), anddenovoproductionofgrowthfactorssuchasIL-2(34)andthiols(35),chemokines(36), and cytokines (37). Therefore for DCs to serve as \"nature's adjuvants\" forimmunity(11),theyneedtomatureinresponsetostimuliinherenttotheinfection,vaccine, or other settings such as transplantation and contact allergy. The expanding literature on the capacity of DCs to induce T cell tolerance in vivooriginatedwithexperimentsonDCsthatarenotfullymature,especiallythosefound in peripheral lymphoid tissues in the steady state. It has become possibleto deliver dened antigens to specic populations of DCs in the absence of mat-uration stimuli (23-25) without subjecting the DCs to isolation and manipulationex vivo, procedures that can mature the cells (11,38,39). The targeting of anti-genstoDCsinvivoinvolvesspecicuptakereceptorsthatdelivertheantigenstoprocessing compartments for the formation of class I and II MHC-peptide com-plexes. Importantly, DCs within lymphoid tissues are able to form MHC-peptidecomplexes in the steady state without the administration of maturation stimuli.Naive T cells, after recognizing their ligands on these DCs, divide repeatedlybut are then deleted, and the animal becomes tolerant. In contrast, if maturationstimuli are coadministered with antigen, immunity develops. Another strategy todampen immune function is to prepare DCs ex vivo and expose them to antigenbut not to full-maturation stimuli. These DCs, when reinfused, downregulate im-munity(40-43)andcaninduceregulatoryTcells(seebelow).Incontrast,matureDCsareimmunogenicinanimals(32,44)andhumans(16,45-48).However,thephysiological counterpart of these ex vivo-derived human DCs and the induc-tion of authentic tolerance by regulatory T cells in vivo in humans remain to bedened.

Can T cell tolerance be induced to low levels of intact proteins including self and environmentalantigens? During dendritic cell maturation a mixture of microbial, self-, and environmental antigens are captured simultaneously. How is the initiation of autoimmunity and chronic reactivity to theseantigens avoided? Clinically, suppression of the immune response utilizes antigen-nonspecic inhibitors. Can antigen-specic tolerance be induced to transplants, allergens, and autoantigens? There are many mechanisms for tolerance: anergy, deletion, and regulatory and suppressor T cells. How are these mechanisms induced and controlled in vivo? ThisreviewonDCsintolerancedealswithfourchallengingquestions(Table1). First,isitpossibletouselowdosesofintactantigenstosilencetheimmunesysteminvivo?Itseemsvitalthattheimmunesystemremainstoleranttointactproteins,bothselfandenvironmental,thatarepresentinsmallamounts.Yetexperimentally,ithasbeennecessarytousehighdosesofsolubleproteinsandusuallypreprocessedpeptides to induce tolerance (49-53). We review how the targeting of antigens toappropriate DCs induces tolerance in vivo with low doses of antigen and therebymoreeffectivelycontrolsthetolerogenicpotentialoftheimmunesystem.Second,when DCs are maturing in response to an infection, how do they avoid the riskof inducing autoimmunity to self-antigens and chronic reactivity to environmen-tal proteins? It is to be expected that DCs during infection will present a mix ofantigens,notjustthosefromthemicrobebutalsoantigensfromdyingself-tissuesand from proteins in the airway or intestine. We consider the evidence that DCsmay solve this dilemma by ensuring that tolerance develops to those harmlessantigensthatwillsubsequentlybeprocessedduringinfection.Third,canantigen-specic tolerance be induced in clinical settings, such as transplantation, allergy,and autoimmunity? Current treatments employ antigen-nonspecic immune sup-pressants that globally block lymphocyte costimulation and cytokine production.DC-based tolerance offers the potential to manipulate the immune response in amore antigen-specic manner. Fourth, how are the many known mechanisms forT cell tolerance [reviewed elsewhere (54-57)] engaged and controlled in the in-tact animal and patient? We review examples in which antigen presentation viaDCs leads to the control of specic tolerance mechanisms in vivo. The control oftolerance is in a sense analogous to the control of immunity (58) in that antigens,lymphocytes, and DCs need to operate in concert. ROLE OF DENDRITIC CELLS IN CENTRAL TOLERANCE A Role for Dendritic Cells in T Cell Deletion TheexperimentsofMedawerandcolleaguesdemonstratedthatthedevelopingim- mune system could be actively and specically silenced or tolerized.

Thus,allogeneic DCs can redene \"self\" if they are able to access the thymus prior todevelopment of the T cell repertoire.

Both DCs and epithelial cells induced deletionaltolerance (63). A less invasive approach to establishing DC function in central tolerance used the CD11c promoter to express the I-E gene selectively in the thymic DCs ofC57BL/6 mice (64). This led to efcient I-E reactive, V fl5 C andVfl11C,CD4CTcells.Incontrasttotheirfunctioninnegativeselection,DCs areneitheractivenorrequiredforpositiveselection,whichcanbefullysupportedby cortical epithelial cells (65-67).

However, experiments that selectively target antigens to thymic DCs, as wedescribe for peripheral lymphoid organs below, have yet to be carried out. It alsois difcult to selectively engraft DCs into the thymus in vivo.

Two features of thymic DC function are currently apparent.

THE NEED FOR EFFICIENT MECHANISMS OF PERIPHERAL TOLERANCE Centraltoleranceisefcient,butitisalsoincomplete.Self-reactiveTcells,espe- cially those with a lower afnity for self-antigens, can escape negative selection(76). Other self-proteins, for which tolerance is required, may not access the thy-mus.

Examples included infected cells (79-81), tumor antigens from both CD4 Cand CD8CEBV- specic T cells (86,87). With dying allogeneic cells, it was possible to monitorthe formation of MHC class II-peptide complexes directly with a specic anti-body.Whenthiswasdone,theformationofMHC-peptidecomplexeswas >1000 times more efcient when DCs were given a protein as part of a dying cell rel-ative to preprocessed peptide (84). In all of these examples, a foreign antigen ispresented,buttheentirecellisprocessed,andthereforetheDCsshouldbeloadedwith MHC-self- and MHC-nonself-peptide complexes. An additional literature shows that DCs also capture soluble proteins in the steadystate,intheabsenceofovertinfectionoradjuvants(88-91).Intheseearlyexperiments, which used several different routes of antigen injection, DCs wereisolatedfromtheanimalsandaddedtoactivatedantigen-specicTcellsinculture;the T cells then proliferated without further addition of antigen. More recent ex-periments directly visualized in vivo DC uptake of soluble proteins administeredinto the airway (92) and of self-components from intestinal and gastric epithelialcells (93,94). Therefore DCs are continually capturing and presenting self- andharmless environmental proteins.

Finally,DEC-205isanexcellentantigendeliveryvehiclebecausemonoclonal antibodies to this receptor target DCs in vivo. injected subcutaneously, most CD11c CDCs in the draining lymph node take up the antibody (23). Uptake is not detected in lymphocytesor macrophages, either in cell suspension or in tissue sections. In conclusion,DEC-205 is a valuable antigen-targeting receptor on DCs because antigens de-livered to this receptor are processed for presentation on both MHC class I and IIand because targeting is specic and efcient.

However, these monolectins have been studied primarily inhuman cell cultures and there is no information concerning antigen presentationinvivo,includingtheexogenouspathwaytoMHCclassI.Thisisofsomeinterestbecause the lectins are expressed by subsets of DCs. For example, Langerin orCD207 is expressed in Langerhans cells (110), the asialoglycoprotein receptortype 1 (111) and DC-SIGN or CD209 (112) DCs, and theBDCA-2 molecule in plasmacytoid DCs (113).

In summary, there are many potential ways to enhance the efciency of antigenpresentationthroughreceptor-mediateduptake,butformostofthese,thereislittlein vivo validation at this time. Delivery of Peptides Engineered into the Anti-DEC-205 Antibody To test the idea that antibodies to DEC-205 efciently target antigens to DCsin vivo, the heavy chain of the antibody was engineered to include a sequence Annu.

The constant regions of the rat heavy chain also were replaced with mouse C regionscarrying mutations to block binding to Fc \u00b0receptors. Submicrogram amounts of the engineered antibody were then injected into mice that were adoptivelytransferred with HEL-specic TCR transgenic T cells.

The opposite outcome developed if parallel groups of animalsweregivenanti-DEC-205/HELantibodyplusaDCmaturationstimulus,agonisticCD40 antibody. Under DC maturation conditions, the transgenic CD4 CT cells produced large amounts of IFN- \u00b0and were not deleted (23).

CELL-ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS TARGETED TO DENDRITIC CELLS IN THE STEADY ALSO INDUCE DELETIONALTOLERANCE Delivery of Pancreatic Islet flCell Antigens to Dendritic Cells Several laboratories have produced transgenic mice using the rat insulin pro- moter to direct antigen expression in pancreatic islet flcells. In each case fl cell-associated antigens were presented to T cells (both CD8Cand CD4C)i n the steady state. However, antigen presentation was not mediated by the islet fl cells but by bone marrow-derived cells in the draining pancreatic lymph nodes.Forexample,whenMHCclassIrestrictedovalbumin-specicTcellswereadop-tivelytransferredintomiceexpressingovalbuminaspartoftheexternaldomainofthe transferrin receptor, T cell proliferation was found in the draining pancreaticlymphnodes(115,116).Inthisparticulartransgenicline,theratinsulinpromoteralsodroveexpressionofovalbumininrenalepithelium.Accordingly,presentationtoOT-ITcellstookplaceinrenallymphnodesaswell.Toproveantigenpresenta-tionbybonemarrow-derivedcells,bonemarrowchimeraswereconstructedsuchthatonlybonemarrow-derivedcellscouldpresenttherelevantpeptide(the flcells expressed mutant H-2K bMHC class I molecules that could not present peptide to OT-I T cells).

ConrmationthatDCsinlymphnodespresentcell-associatedantigenshasalso been obtained using RIP transgenic mice expressing a herpes virus glycoproteininflcells.Inasensitivebioassay,CD11c CpancreaticlymphnodeDCsfromthese mice presented antigen to a virus-specic, CD8CT-T hybridoma (121). When DCs from these mice were fractionated into CD8CDCs and CD8\u00a1DCs, only the CD8Cfraction was active in antigen presentation. In contrast, when presentation wasstudiedinanothersystem(apancreaticislet flautoantigenforCD4CTcells), the CD11b high (also CD8\u00a1) DC subset presented antigen (118).

Capture and processing of cell-associated antigen in the periphery has been documented using monoclonal antibodies to an authentic autoantigen, the protonpump ATPase of the gastric parietal cell (94). This autoantigen was found inCD11c Ccells beneath the gastric epithelium and in the draining lymph node. Furthermore, the number of ATPase-containing DCs increased markedly duringgastritis relative to the steady state. The antigen was processed to form MHC-peptide complexes in vivo because CD11c CDCs could be isolated (exclusively fromthegastriclymphnode),treatedwithchloroquinetoblockantigenprocessingupon isolation, and shown to stimulate ATPase-specic T cells (94). Immune Tolerance Induced by Dendritic Cells Presenting Antigens from Dying Cells ThefunctionalconsequencesofthepresentationofdyingcellsbyDCswerestudied with ovalbumin as a surrogate cell-associated antigen (25). In this experimentalsystem, antigen is introduced into the dying cells by osmotic shock (123). Deadcells are then injected into mice, whereupon the cells are taken up by recipientDCs (124). Uptake is remarkably selective for the CD8 Csubset of splenic DCs, one of the clearest differences in the functions of the CD8Cand CD8\u00a1subsets (124, 124a). These subsets may differ more in their endocytic receptors, ratherthan their ability to present cell-associated TAP-dependent pathway.CD8 CDCsselectivelycapturedyingcells,butbothsubsetscancaptureviruslike particles(125)andsolubleproteins(K.Liu,B.Bonifaz,K.Inaba&R.M.Steinman,unpublished observations). Asinthecrosspresentationofislet flcellsdiscussedabove,ovalbumin-specic T cells transferred into mice receiving ovalbumin-loaded dead cells at rst pro-liferated actively (25). Again, submicrogram amounts of ovalbumin within theinjected cells were sufcient to induce active proliferation of large numbers ofCD8 CT cells (25). However, most of the antigen-specic T cells were deleted fromtheblood,spleen,andlymphnodesafteroneweek.Furthermore,theanimalsbecame tolerant to immunization with ovalbumin in complete Freund's adjuvant.Interestingly, if the T cells were removed from mice prior to deletion and thenstimulated in culture, they exhibited changes consistent with the development ofimmunity rather than tolerance, that is, upregulation of CD25 IL-2 receptors anddownregulation of CD62L lymph node homing receptors. Although this type ofresponse is often designated as cross-priming, the priming is observed in vitro,whereas tolerance can be the outcome in vivo. Therefore to observe peripheraltolerance induced by DCs in situ, it is important not to perturb the DCs or theT cells from the steady state (25). Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003.21:685-711.

Togetherthesenewexperimentsindicatethat antigenscanbe transferred from many types of donor cells (endocrine cells, epithelial cells, leukocytes) to DCsconstitutively in the steady state and that the outcome of antigen presentation isthe deletion of naive peripheral T cells and systemic antigen-specic tolerance.This pathway may also be capable of deleting memory T cells (127).

Influence of Dendritic Cells on Regulatory T Cell Formation WhenDCsareproducedfromhumanbloodmonocytesbycultureinIL-4andGM-CSF, they are weak initiators of immunity. The physiologic counterpart of thesein vitro-produced immature DCs is not known, but it has been hypothesized thatthey correspond to monocytes beginning to differentiate into DCs during transitfrom tissue afferent lymphatics receptor stimuli, CD40L, orinflammatory cytokines, they become potent stimulators of T cell proliferation Annu.

The T cells alsocan inhibit other T cells from responding to mature DCs in vitro. This regulatoryfunctionrequirescellcontactandisalsopartiallyblockedbyanti-IL-10antibodies,leadingtotheinterpretationthatTr1canbeinducedbymonocyte-derivedimmatureDCs(141).IthasbeenproposedthatDCexpressionoftheILT3immunoglobulin-like transcript also contributes to the induction of Tr/Ts (141a). Similar populations of immature and mature monocyte-derived DCs pulsed with an influenza matrix peptide have been used to examine the CD8 Cimmune response in healthy human volunteers primed by natural exposure to influenza.When the DCs were matured with inflammatory cytokines and injected back intothemonocytedonor,theyinducedaclearimmuneresponse.ThenumberofeffectorCD8 CT cells in blood expanded (47), and memory T cells became responsive to lowerdosesofmatrixpeptide(18).Incontrast,1weekafterinjectionwithmatrixpeptide-pulsed immature DCs, the two volunteers showed a marked decrease intheirmemoryIFN- \u00b0responseandaparallelincreaseinmatrix-peptideresponsive, IL-10 producing cells (41). With time (months), the IL-10 producers waned andthe IFN-\u00b0producers reappeared. However, when CD8 CT from the 1-week immunesamplesweremixedwithpreimmunizationorrecoverysamples,theIFN-\u00b0responsewasnullied(142).Alltheeffectswerespecicforflumatrixpeptide; thatis,therewerenoIL-10producingcellsforEBVandcytomegalovirus(CMV)peptides, and the peptide did not suppress EBV and CMV responses. Theseexperiments were interpreted to mean that DCs produced from monocytes withGM-CSF and IL-4 expand specic Tr1 cells when injected in vivo. DCs isolated from mouse lungs after intranasal administration of ovalbumin (143), or from mouse spleen after administration of aggregated Ig (42), produceIL-10,asisthecaseforDCsingutmucosal-associatedlymphoidtissue(144)andlipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte-derived DCs from human blood (145-147). IL-10 enhances the formation of mouse (148) and human (132,149) Tr1.The DCs isolated from lungs following intranasal ovalbumin caused cultured TcellstoproduceIL-10(aswellasIL-4)(143).ThisworkhasrecentlybeenextendedtoDCsandantigen-specicTreginvivo,withevidenceforacriticalroleforICOS-ligand expression on the DCs (143a).

The T cell is likely to be a major determinant in the tolerance outcome. In the thymus engagement of the TCR on a newly generated single positive thymocytemayinitiateanapoptoticprograminvolvingthebimproapoptoticpathway(150).Inotherwords,antigen-presentingthymicDCsmaynotrequireaspecialcapacitytokilldevelopingself-reactivethymocytes.Analogously,peripheraltolerancemaybe the \"default\" pathway, again proceeding via bim (151) whenever T cells arestimulatedtogrowintheabsenceoffurtherstimulifrommaturingDCs.DCmat-uration is the critical switch that provides signals for effector T cell developmentandmemory,divertingTcellsfromapoptosistoprotectiveimmunefunction.Forexample,maturationstimulatesDCstoproduceimmune-enhancingcytokineslikeIL-12 or IFN- and to express high levels of membrane costimulatory molecules that promote T cell survival and cytokine/cytolysin production. A more active potential immunosuppressive pathway that needs to be eval- uated in vivo involves DC production of tryptophan metabolites through theaction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (Figure 1). IDO exists in DCswithin mouse (152) and human (152a) lymphoid tissues, and expression mayincrease during inflammation (152a). IDO activity can be induced via IFN- \u00b0 receptors, and this leads to T cell apoptosis in culture (152). IFN- \u00b0receptors (CD119) are the cytokines may be critical for the differentiation of Tr1.IL-10productioncouldinturnbestimulatedbyproductsinanexposedepitheliumlike the airway or intestine or by microbial products in the lumen. Alternatively,some suppressor cells may be programmed to suppress when they are generatedin the thymus. Even though tolerogenic DCs may not kill peripheral T cells directly, the DCs nevertheless need to carry out several sets of activities (Figure 1). The rst is thecaptureandprocessingofself-andenvironmentalantigens,includingforpresen-tation on MHC class I products. Figure 1 diagrams a number of specializationsof DCs in antigen presentation, i.e., the formation of MHC-peptide complexes.These specializations include distinct endocytic receptors, the efcacy in carry-ing out the exogenous pathway for processing and presentation on MHC class I,and the regulation of antigen processing during responses to maturation stimuli.A second set of DC features pertains to their migration and homing properties.

For personal use only. 23 Jan ThesepositionDCsappropriatelyinthesteadystateforthecaptureofdyingcells and environmental proteins and for interaction with T cells in lymphoid tissues.Distinct chemokine receptors can be expressed by DCs in different subsets (plas-macytoidDCsexpressCXCR4;monocyte-derivedDCstypicallyexpressCCR5),locations (epithelial DCs express CCR6), and maturation states (mature DCs al-ways express CCR7). Nonetheless, much needs to be learned about the origin ofDCs in the T cell areas of lymphoid organs and the control of DC trafc in thesteady state. Third, immature DCs can express adhesion molecules for T cells,suchasDC-SIGNorCD209,alectinthatbindsICAM-3onrestingTcells(156).In the steady state, DCs in lymphoid organs also express signicant amounts ofCD80 and CD86, but the role of these molecules in tolerance remains to be as-certained. Likewise, many members of the TNF family can be expressed by DCs(e.g., OX40L/CD134L, 4-1BBL/CD137L), but their expression in vivo needs ad-ditional investigation. CD134L seems important for mesenteric lymph node DCstodrivecolitis-inducingTcells(156a).ManyofthesefeaturesofDCscanchangewithmaturation.TheDCsthendampenexpressionofsomepropertiesandacquirenew functions, including the production of growth factors like IL-2 and thiols,cytokines, and much higher levels of T cell interaction molecules like CD40,CD86, and B7-DC, which allow DCs to play active roles in initiating immunity(Figure 1). Will Targeting to Dendritic Cells Lead to Tolerance with Low Doses of Antigen? As mentioned in Table 1, one of the enigmas in tolerance is how the immune systemremainstoleranttosmallamountsofmostharmlessproteinsthatarepresentin the steady state, especially when DCs should be able to process and presentmanyoftheseself-andenvironmentalproteinsduringDCmaturationinresponseto infection. In physiologic circumstances, DCs appear to be the predominantcells that continually take up and process antigens for presentation to T cells.Many of the markers used to identify DCs are in fact endocytic receptors thatcouldenhanceantigenuptake.WementionedabovesuchmoleculesasDEC-205,langerin, asialoglycoprotein receptor, BDCA-2, and DC-SIGN (Figure 1). Onceantigenistakenup,DCsseemparticularlyefcientatformingandexportingMHCclass II peptide complexes (32, 157, 158, 158a). For example, when a DC takesup 10 5I-E molecules from dying B cells, it forms several thousand MHC II/I-E peptide complexes (84). Furthermore, DCs are procient and perhaps unique inprocessingnonreplicatingantigensintopeptidesthataretransportedintotheroughendoplasmic reticulum by TAPs and presented on MHC class I products. Thisexogenous pathway extends to dying cells, immune complexes, and ligands forthe DEC-205 receptor (Figure 1). Uptake and processing mechanisms are continuously active in the immature DCslocatedwithinlymphoidtissuesinthesteadystate.Thesefunctionsarefurtherbuttressed by the capacity of additional DCs to patrol peripheral tissues, picking Annu.

Two intriguingnewstudiesindicatethatasubsetofCD16Cmonocytesarespecialized to differentiate into DCs that move from tissues into lymph (158a), and that DCscanupregulatetheCCR7lymphnodehomingreceptorfollowinguptakeofdyingcells(158c),withuptakeofdyingautologouscellsbeingasteadystatefunctionofDCs(25)(93).Todate,onlyDCsinlymphoidorganshavebeenshowntoprocessantigens in the steady state, and it is possible that DCs in peripheral tissues needto receive additional stimuli to present the antigens they have captured. Other cell types may not gain access to signicant amounts of self- and envi- ronmentalantigensinthesteadystateormaynotprocessthemtoMHCclassIandclass II peptide complexes the same efciency as DCs. However, non-DCsmay present MHC-peptide complexes when animals are given large amounts ofantigen,especiallyiftheantigenisgivenaspreprocessedpeptides,asisthecaseinseveralreportsontheinductionofperipheraltolerance.Theunderlyingtolerancemechanism induced by non-DCs may be anergy, which is a reversible form oftolerance.Evidenceforanergyinductionthroughnon-DCswasrecentlyobtainedwith NKT cells from mice treated with high doses of a glycolipid, -galactosyl ceramide (10). This synthetic drug is presented on CD1d molecules to invariantTCRsonNKTcells.IftheglycolipidwasselectivelytargetedtoDCs,aprolongedeffectortypeofNKTresponsewasinduced,butifthedrugwasallowedtoaccessnon-DCs, the latter induced dominant anergy in the NKT cells. How Might Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells Contribute to Disease and Therapy? If DCs continually sample self to induce peripheral tolerance, then chronic ac- tivation would vitiate their role in bringing about T cell deletion. In the autoim-munediseasesystemiclupuserythematosusevidencehasbeenobtainedthatbloodmonocytesexpressfeaturesofstimulatoryDCs(159)owingtoincreasesinserumIFN-(159). It is proposed that the more stimulatory DCs in lupus may present self-nucleoprotein complexes, resulting in autoimmunity rather than tolerance.Similarly, when CD40L is expressed as a transgene in mouse epidermis underthe control of the K14 promoter, Langerhans cells are chronically mature, andsystemic autoimmunity develops (160). It is evident that many tissue antigens do not induce tolerance but are ignored by the immune system (161,162). These ignored antigens would then have thepotential to induce autoimmunity. Ignorance in cell biological terms may meanthatanantigenisinsufcientlyprocessedandpresentedbyDCsinthesteadystate.Forexample,whenantigensfromislet flcellsarepresentedbylymphnodeDCsin thesteadystate,alowlevelofantigenexpressionintheisletsisassociatedwithpoorantigen presentation in the lymph node (163).

It has been hypothesizedthat this situation may occur with persistent microbes that are taken up by DCswithout maturing them (95). The DCs may then unwittingly induce tolerance,eitherdeletingreactiveTcellsorinducingregulatorycells.HIV-1maybesuchanexample because it is produced in high amounts in the absence of antiretroviraldrugs, and DCs in the steady state express receptors to capture virus.
