Where multiple person models are used, the provider must ensure that all elemen ts of the protocol are complied with in the provision of vaccination to each individual. The provider is responsible for ensuring that persons are trained and competent to safely deliver the activity they are employed to provide under this protocol. As a m inimum, competence requirements stipulated in the protocol must be adhered to. All persons must be designated by name by the provider as an approved person under the current terms of this protocol before working to it, and listed on the practitioner autho risation sheet in Appendix A . Protocols do not remove inherent obligations or accountability. All practitioners operating under this protocol must work within their terms of employment at all times; registered healthcare professionals should also abide by their professional code of conduct. There are three underpinning principles to which every person undertaking activities under the remit of this protocol must adhere : Version 1.0 Page 6 of 25 1. Training They must have undertaken training appropriate to this protocol and relevant t o their role, as required by local policy and UK standard operating procedures and in line with the Training recommendations for COVID -19 vaccinators They must have completed the covid -19 vaccination e -learning programme , including the relevant vaccine specific session, an d/or locall y-provided COVID -19 Vaccine training 2. Competency Those providing clinical supervision to those administering the vaccine must be competent to assess individuals for suitability for vaccination, identify any contraindications/exclusions or precautions, discuss issues related to vaccination and obtain info rmed consent from the individuals being vaccinated. They must have been signed off as competent using the COVID -19 vaccinator competency assessment tool if new to or returning to immunisation after a prolonged period (more than 12 months), or have used the tool for self -assessment if an experienced vaccinator (vaccinating within past 12 month) . They should be observed administering the vaccine until both they, and their supervisor or trainer, feel confident that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to administer vaccines safely and competently. In addi tion, and where indicated as rele vant to the role : They must be familiar with the vaccine pro duct and alert to any changes in the manufacturers summary of product characteristics (SPC), should it become licensed, or the Regulation 174 Information for UK Healthcare Professionals and familiar with the national recommendations for the use of this vac cine. They must be familiar with, and alert to changes in relevant chapters of Immunisation Against Infectious Disease: t he Green Book COVID -19: the green book, chapter 14a - GOV.UK They must be familiar with, and alert to changes in the relevant provider's standard operating procedures (SOPs) and provider's arrangements for the COVID -19 vaccination programme They must be competent in the correct handling and st orage of vaccines and management of the cold chain if receiving, responsible for, or handling the vaccine. They must be competent in the recognition and management of anaphylaxis, have completed basic life support training and be able to respond appropria tely to immediate adverse reactions. They must have access to the provider's protocols and relevant COVID -19 vaccination programme online resources. They must be competent in intramuscular injection technique if they are administering the vaccine, this s hould include a practical element. For those preparing the vaccine, they must be competent in the handling of the vaccine product and use of the correct technique for drawing up the correct dose. For those in record keeping roles, they must understand the importance of making sure vaccine information is recorded on the vaccination management system They should fulfil any additional requirements defined by local policies developed in accordance wit h any UK guidance. 3. Supervision A period of supervised practice to allow observation of, and development of skills in vaccine administration and application of knowl edge to practice is essential. Supervision for new immunisers and support for all immunisers is critical to the safe and successful delivery of the COVID -19 immunisation programme. Non-registered professionals and non -registered Armed Forces staff must be supervised and supported by a registered healthcare professional at all times. The clinical supervisor must be a registered healthcare professional trained and competent in all aspects of the protocol and provide clinical supervision for the overall provision of clinical care provide d under the protocol. Version 1.0 Page 7 of 25 3. Clinical condition or situation to which this Protocol applies COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is indicated for the active immunisation of individuals for the prevention of COVID -19 infection caused by SARS -CoV-2, in accordance with the UK immunisation programme and recommendations given in Chapter 14a of the Immunisation Against Infectious Disease: the 'Green Book', JCVI statement on Priority groups for c oronavirus (COVID -19 vaccination), 30 December 2020 and subsequent correspondence/publications from Northern Ireland Department of Health . 4. Clinical informati on STAGE 1: Assessment of the individual presenting for vaccination ACTIVITY STAGE 1a: Assess the individual presenting for vaccination against the inclusion and exclusion criteria below . If they are not eligible for vaccination or need to return at a later date , advise them accordingly. Clinical condition or situation to which this P rotocol applies COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is indicated for the active immunisation of individuals for the prevent ion of COVID -19 caused by coronavirus ( SARS - CoV-2) infection, in accordance with the COVID -19 vaccination programme and recommendations given in Chapter 14a of Immunisation Against Infectious Disease: the 'Green Book ' and subsequent correspondence /publications from the Department of Health. Criteria for inclusion (continued over page) UK policy must be followed in relation to the priority groups eligible for vaccination at a particular point in time. JCVI Phase One COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca should be offered to individuals, aged 18 years and over, in accordance with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidance on 'Priority groups for coronavirus (COVID - 19) vaccination' in the following order of priority, starting with those to be vaccinated first: Priority Risk group 1 Residents in a care home for older adults and their carers 2 All those 80 years of age and over Frontline health and social care workers ( see HSS(MD) 82/2020 ) 3 All those 75 years of age and over 4 All those 70 years of age and over Clinically extremely vulnerable2 individuals (see Definition of clinically extremely vulnerable groups ) 5 All those 65 ye ars of age and over 6 All individuals aged 16 years3 to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality (see Appendix A or Chapter 14a )4 2 Individuals who have been identified as c linically extremely vulnerable should have this status flagged in their GP record. 3 COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is only authorised for use in those 18 years of age and over (see Criteria for exclusion ). COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 may be a suitable alternative for those 16 -17 years of age. 4 This also includes those who are in receipt of a carer's allowance, or those who are the main carer of an elderly or disabled person whose welfare may be at risk if the carer falls ill. Version 1.0 Page 8 of 25 Criteria for inclusion (continued) 7 All those 60 years of age and over 8 All those 55 years of age and over 9 All those 50 years of age and over JCVI has advised that vaccination in pregnancy should be considered, where the risk of exposure to SARS -CoV-2 infection is high and cannot be avoided, or where the woman has underlying conditions that put them at very high risk of serious complications of COVID -19. In these circumstances, clinicians should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with the woman, who should be told about the absence of safety data for the vaccine in pregnancy (see Special considerations / Additional Information ). JCVI P hase Two The COVID -19 vaccination programme will be extended to individuals aged 18 to 49 years of age who are not already included in the nine JCVI priority groups listed above. This P rotocol may be used for individuals aged 18 to 49 years in line with Department of Health policy announcements . The risk to the individual of not being immunised must be considered. The indications for risk groups are not exhaustive, and the practitioner should consider the risk of COVID -19 exacerbating any underlying disease that an individual may have, as well as the risk of serious illness from coronavirus itself. Where appropriate, such individuals should be referred for assessment of clinical risk. Where risk is identified as equivalent to thos e currently eligible for immunis ation, vaccination may be provided by an appropriate prescriber or on a patient specific basis, under a patient specific direction (PSD). Implementation of the COVID -19 vaccination programme should aim to achieve high vaccine uptake whilst prioritising those most at risk . Implementation should also involve flexibility in vaccine deployment at a local level . Operational considerations, such as minimising wastage, may require a flexible approach to prioritisation, where decisions are t aken in consultation with UK or local public health experts . However, the priority order in the table above should be followed if it is reasonably practicable to do so. Criteria for exclusion5 (continued over page) Individuals for whom valid consent, or 'best -interests' decision in accordance the common law in Northern Ireland in relation to the best interests of the incapacitous individual has not been obtained. For further information on consent see Reference guide to consent for examination or treatment . Individuals who: are less than 18 years of age have had a previous syst emic allergic reaction (including immediate - onset anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca or to any component of the vaccine or residues from the manufacturing process6. are suffering from acute severe febrile illness (the presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication for immunisation) 5 Exclusion under this protocol does not necessarily mean the medication is contraindicated, but it would be outside its remit and another form of authorisation will be required. 6 injections . Version 1.0 Page 9 of 25 Criteria for exclusion (continued) have received a full dose of COVID -19 Vaccine in the preceding 28 days have completed a course of COVID -19 vaccination are participating in a COVID -19 Vaccine clinical trial; unless they have consulted the trial team and have been provided with written advice that they can be safely vaccinated in the routine COVID -19 vaccination programme. Note: People participating in a COVID -19 research trial other than a vaccine trial (e.g. survey / questionnaire) can receive the COVID -19 vaccination, provided they fulfil the other inclusion criteria at the time of offer. If there is any doubt please refer to the appropriate clinical trial leads. are advised by the UK regulator, the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA), not to receive COVID -19 V accine AstraZeneca ( see Cautions including any relevant action to be taken ). Cautions including any relevant action to be taken (Continued over page ) The COVID -19 chapter of the Green Book advises that there are very few individuals who cannot receive COVID -19 V accine. Where there is doubt, rather than withholding vaccination, appropriate advice should be sought from the relevant specialist, or from the PHA Duty Room. Patients with a history of allergy Facilities for management of anaphylaxis should b e available at all vaccination sites (see Chapter 8 of the Green Book). Patients who have: a previous allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) to a food, insect sting and most medicines (where trigger has been identified); a family history of allergies; a previous non -systemic reaction to a vaccine; a hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen; a history of mastocytosis may proceed with vaccination as normal, according to local guidelines. The AstraZeneca vaccine does not contain polyethylene glycol (PEG) but does contain a related compound called polysorbate 80. Some people with PEG allergy may also be allergic to polysorbate 80. However, polysorbate 80 is widely used in medicines and foods, and is present in many medicines including monoclonal antibody preparations. Some injected influenza vaccines (including the main vaccin e used in over 65 year olds) contain polysorbate 80. Individuals who have tolerated injections that contain polysorbate 80 (such as certain influenza vaccines) are likely to tolerate the AstraZeneca vaccine. Special precautions as described in Chapter 14a of the Green Book , and consideration of the possibility of undiagnosed PEG -allergy, is required for individuals with: history of immediate anaphylaxis to multipl e, different drug classes, with the trigger unidentified (this may indicate PEG allergy) history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, injected antibody preparation or a medicine likely to contain PEG (such as depot steroid injection, laxative) history of idiopathic anaphylaxis Such individuals should not be vaccinated with the Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 Vaccine or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, except on the expert advice of an allergy specialist and under a patient specific direction (PSD). The COVID -19 AstraZeneca vaccine can be use d as an alternative (unless Version 1.0 Page 10 of 25 Cautions including any relevant action to be taken (continued) otherwise contraindicated), particularly if they previously tolerated an injected influenza vaccine. In these circumstances, COVID -19 AstraZeneca vaccine should be administered in a setting with full resuscitation facilities (e. g. a hospital), and a 30 minute observation period is recommended. Patients who experienced an immediate -type allergic reaction to the first dose of COVID -19 Vaccine, where symptoms were limited to swelling or rash local to the injection site only, can ha ve the second dose using the same vaccination in any vaccination setting. Observe the patient for 30 minutes. Patients who experienced delayed urticaria / angioedema to the first dose of COVID -19 Vaccine, where the reaction was self -limiting or resolved w ith oral antihistamine, can have the second dose using the same vaccination in any setting. Consider pre -treatment with non -sedating antihistamine, 30 minutes prior to vaccination. Patients who experienced delayed urticaria / angioedema to the first dose of COVID -19 Vaccine, where medical attention was required, should be referred to an allergy specialist for advice on the second dose. Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a psychogenic respo nse to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic -clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. Bleeding disorders Individuals with a bleeding disorder may develop a haematoma at the injection site (see Route of Administration ). Past history of COVID -19 infection There is no evidence of any safety concerns from vaccinating individuals with a past history of COVID -19 infection, or with detectable COVID -19 antibody. Vaccination of individuals who may be infected but asymptomatic or incubating COVID -19 infection is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on the illness. Vaccination should be defer red in those with confirmed infection to avoid onward transmission and confusing the differential diagnosis. As clinical deterioration can occur up to two weeks after infection, ideally vaccination should be deferred until clinical recovery to around four weeks after onset of symptoms or four weeks from the first confirmed positive specimen in those who are asymptomatic. Having prolonged COVID -19 symptoms is not a contraindication to receiving COVID -19 Vaccine but if the individual is seriously debilitated, still under active investigation, or has evidence of recent deterioration, deferral of vaccination may be considered to avoid incorrect attribution of any change in the person's underlying condition to the vaccine. Version 1.0 Page 11 of 25 Vaccine Surveillance The U K regulator will maintain real -time surveillance post deployment of COVID -19 Vaccines in the UK. In response to any safety signals, MHRA may provide temporary advice or make substantive amendments to the authorised conditions of the vaccine product's suppl y in the UK. Supply under this Protocol must be in accordance with the most up -to-date advice or amendments (see Green Book Chapter 14a and Information for Healthcare Professionals on COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca ). Action to be taken if the patient is excluded In a GP practice setting, inform or refer to the GP or a prescriber as appropriate. The risk to the individual of not being immunised must be considered. The indications for risk groups are not exhaustive, and the healthcare practitioner should consider the risk of COVID -19 exacerbating any underlying disease that an individual may have, as well as the risk of serious illness from COVID -19 itself. Where appropriate, such individuals should be referred for assessment of clinical risk. Where risk is identified as equiv alent to those currently eligible for immunisation, vaccination may be provided by an appropriate prescriber or on a patient specific basis, under a PSD. In case of postponement due to acute illness, advise when the individual can be vaccinated and, if possible, ensure another appointment is arranged. Individuals who have had a previous systemic allergic reaction (including immediate onset anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca or any component of the vaccine should not receive f urther COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. Refer to an allergy specialist. Children under 16 years of age, even if they are clinically extremely vulnerable, are at low risk of serious morbidity and mortality and, given the absence of safety and efficacy data on the vaccine, are not recommended for vaccination. Limited data suggest that children with neurological comorbidities may be at greater risk of developing severe COVID -19. Refer to Green Book Chapter 14a for up -to-date advice on COVID -19 vaccination in children. Note: vaccination in children under 18 years of age is not covered by this P rotocol (a PSD would be required). Individuals who are participating in a cli nical trial of COVID -19 Vaccines who present for vaccination should be referred back to the investigators unless they have written advice in relation to receiving the COVID -19 Vaccine in the routine programme. Document the reason for exclusion and any acti on taken in the individual's clinical records. Advice should be sought from the individual's clinician in the first instance. Further advice also may be provided from the PHA Immunisation Team: pha.immunisation@hscni.net . Action to be taken if the patient or carer declines treatment Informed consent, from the individual or a person legally able to act on the person's behalf, must be obtained for each administration and recorded appropriately. Where a person lacks the capacity, in accordance with the the common law in Northern Ireland in relation to the best interests of the incapacitous individual , a decision to vaccinate may be made in the individual's best interests. Version 1.0 Page 12 of 25 Advise individual/parent/carer about the protective effects of the vaccine, the risks of infection and potential com plications if not immunised. Advise how future immunisation may be accessed if they subsequently decide to receive the COVID -19 Vaccine. Document advice given and the decision reached. Inform or refer to the GP or a prescriber as appropriate. Arrangements for referral for medical advice Seek appropriate advice from the individual's clinician as required. STAGE 1b : Description of treatment ACTIVITY STAGE 1b: Consider any relevant cautions, interactions or adverse drug reactions. Provide a dvice to the individual and obtain informed consent1. Record individual's consent1 and ensure vaccinator, if another person, is informed of the vaccine product to be administered. Name, strength & formulation of drug COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, solution for injection, in a multi -dose vial. Each 4ml vial contains 8 doses and each 5ml vial contains 10 doses of vaccine. The vaccine is a colourless to slightly brown, clear to slightly opaque liquid (see Route / Method of Administration ). Legal category COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is provided temporary authorisation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for supply in the UK under regulation 174 and 174A, pending UK marketing authorisation. The regulation 174 authorised product is categorised as a prescription only medicine (POM). Black triangle COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca did not have a UK marketing authorisation at the time this Protocol was written and is authorised for temporary supply in the UK in accordance with a Regulation 174 authorisation. As a new vaccine product, MHRA ha s a specific interest in the reporting of adverse drug reactions for this product , see https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/the -yellow -card-scheme/ Off-label use COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is supplied in the UK in accordance with regulation 174 and did not have a UK marketing authorisation at the time of writing this Protocol. As part of the consent process, healthcare professionals must inform the individual /carer that t his vaccine has been authorised for temporary supply in the UK by the MHRA and that it is being offered in accordance with national guidance. The Regulation 174 Information for UK recipients for COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca should be available to inform co nsent. Drug interactions Continued over page Immunosuppression Although COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca contains a live adenovirus vector, this virus is non -replicating and is considered safe in immunosuppressed people. Version 1.0 Page 13 of 25 Drug interactions (continued ) Individuals with immunosuppression may not make a full immune response to vaccination. The small number of patients who are about to receive planned immunosuppressive therapy should be considered for vaccination prior to commencing therapy (ideally at leas t two weeks before), when their immune system is better able to make a response. Where possible, it would also be preferable for the 2 -dose schedule to be completed prior to commencing immunosuppression. This would entail offering the second dose at the recommended minimum for that vaccine (three or four weeks from the first dose) to provide maximum benefit that may not be received if the second dose was given during the period of immunosuppression. Any decision to defer immunosuppressive therapy or to dela y possible benefit from vaccination until after therapy should not be taken without due consideration of the risks from COVID -19 and from their underlying condition. Co-administration with other vaccines Although no data for co -administration of COVID -19 Vaccine with other vaccines exists, in the absence of such data first principles would suggest that interference between inactivated vaccines with different antigenic content is likely to be limited (see Chapter 11 of Green Book ). Based on experience with other vaccines any potential interference is most likely to result in a slightly attenuated immune response to one of the vaccines. There is no evidence of any safety concerns, although it may make the attribution of any adverse events more difficult. Because of the absence of data on co -administration with COVID -19 Vaccines, it should not be routine to offer appointments to give this vaccine at the same time as other vaccines. Based on current information about the first COVID -19 Vaccines being deployed, scheduling should ideally be separated by an interval of at least 7 days to avoid incorrect attribution of potential adverse events. As COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is considered inactivated, where individuals in an eligible cohort present having received another inactivated or live vaccine, COVID -19 vaccination should still be considered. The same applies for other live and inactivated vaccines w here COVID -19 vaccination has been received first. In many cases, vaccination should proceed to avoid any further delay in protection and to avoid the risk of the patient not returning for a later appointment. In such circumstances, patients should be info rmed about the likely timing of potential adverse events relating to each vaccine. Identification and management of adverse reactions From early phase trials, mild pain and tenderness at the injection site was common with COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca occurring in 88% of 18 -55 year olds, 73% of 56 -69 year olds and 61% of people aged 70 years or over; similar levels were reported after each dose. Short lived systemic symptoms including fatigue and headache were also common but decrease d with age, being reported in 86%, 77%, and 65% of those aged 18 -55, 56 -69 and 70 years or over respectively; most of these were classified as mild or moderate. These reactions were unusual after the second dose (Ramasamy et al, 2020). In the phase 3 study only 1 serious adverse event was reported as possibly linked to the study vaccine. This was a case of transverse myelitis which occurred 14 days after dose 2. (Voysey et al, 2020). As with all vaccines there is a very small possibility of anaphylaxis and facilities for its management must be available. A protocol for the management of anaphylaxis and an anaphylaxis pack must always be available whenever the COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is given. Immediate treatment should include Version 1.0 Page 14 of 25 early treatment with 0.5mg intramuscular adrenaline (0.5ml of 1:1000 or 1mg/ml adrenaline), with an early call for help and further IM adrenaline every 5 minutes. The health professionals overseeing the immunisation service must be trained to recognise an anaphylactic reaction and be familiar with techniques for resuscitation of a patient with anaphylaxis. In the event of a severe adverse reaction individual should be advised to seek medical advice. For a list of adverse reactions for the vaccine refer to Information for Healthcare Professionals on COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca . Individuals should be provided with the advice with in the leaflet What to expect after your COVID -19 vaccination , which cover s the reporting of adverse reactions and their management , such as with analgesic and/or antipyretic medication . Reporting procedure of adverse reactions Healthcare professionals and individuals/carers should report suspected adverse reactions to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using the Yellow Card reporting scheme on: http://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store. As a new vaccine product, MHRA have a specific interest in the reporting of adverse drug reactions for this product, see https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/the -yellow -card-scheme/ . There is also a specific reporting page for COVID -19 vaccinations: https://coronavirus -yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ Any adverse reaction to a vaccine should be documented in the individual's record and the individual's GP should be informed. Anaphylaxis is a very rare, recognised side effect of most vaccines and suspected cases should be reported via the Coronavirus Yellow Card Scheme. Chapter 8 of the Green Book gives detailed guidance on distinguishing between faints, panic attacks and the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. If a case of suspected anaphylaxis meets the clinical features described in Chapter 8 of the Green Book, this should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme as a case of 'anaphylaxis' (or if appropriate 'anaphylactoid reaction'). Cases of less severe allergic reactions (i.e. not including the clinical features of anaphylaxis) should not be reported as anaphylaxis but as 'allergic reaction'. Programmatic Adverse Events should be recorded in line with local procedures and where appropriate e scalated in accordance with UK framework s. Written information to be given to patient or carer Ensure the individual has been provided appropriate written information such as the: Package leaflet: Information for the user for COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca (from European Medicines Agency) COVID -19 Vaccination Record Card What to expect after your COVID -19 vaccination COVID -19 vaccination: women of childbearing age, currently pregnant, or breastfeeding Version 1.0 Page 15 of 25 Patient advice / follow up treatment Immunosuppressed individuals should be advised that they may not make a full immune response to the vaccine. Inform the individual/carer of possible side effects and their management. The individual/carer should be advised to seek medical advice in the event of an adverse reaction. Inform the individual/carer to seek medical attention if the vaccinated individual develops a headache that lasts for more than 4 days after vaccination, or bruising beyond the site of vaccination after a few days. Vaccinated individuals should be advised that it is common to develop a fever after vaccination and that this normally happens within 48 hours after the vaccination and usually goes away within 48 hours. This is a common, expected reaction, and self -isolat ion and testing for COVID -19 are not required unless the individual has other COVID -19 symptoms; has been told by PHA Contact Tracing Services they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID -19; they live with someone who has recently tested positive for COVID -19; or they live with someone who has symptoms of COVID -19. Vaccinated individuals should be advised that if the fever started 48 hours after the vaccination or lasts longer than 48 hours, they should self -isolate and book a tes t. Vaccinated individuals should be advised that feeling generally unwell, shivery, achy and tired were also symptoms commonly reported by vaccine recipients in the clinical trials. Generally, these symptoms were found to resolve within one to two days wit hout treatment but paracetamol can be taken if necessary to relieve any of these symptoms. As has always been recommended, any fever after vaccination should be monitored and if individuals are concerned about their health at any time, they should seek a dvice from their GP. The individual should be advised to seek medical advice in the event of a severe adverse reaction. Inform the individual that they can report suspected adverse reactions to the MHRA using the Yellow Card reporting scheme on: https://coronavirus - yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk When administration is postponed advise the individual how future vaccination may be accessed. When applicable, advise the individual/carer when to return for vacc ination or when a subsequent vaccine dose is due. Specia l considerations / additional information Continued over page Ensure there is immediate access to adrenaline (epinephrine) 1 in 1,000 injection and access to a telephone at the time of vaccination. A protocol for the management of anaphylaxis and an anaphylaxis pack must be readily available in case of an anaphylacti c event. Immediate treatment should include early treatment with 500 micrograms intramuscular adrenaline (0.5ml of 1:1000 or 1mg/ml adrenaline), with an early call for help and further IM adrenaline every 5 minutes if features of anaphylaxis do not resolve . Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are not valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be postponed until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of an y acute illness (including COVID -19) by wrongly attributing any signs or symptoms to the adverse effects of the vaccine. Version 1.0 Page 16 of 25 Special considerations / additional information (continued) Pregnancy There is no known risk associated with giving inactivated, recombinant viral or bacterial vaccines or toxoids during pregnan cy or whilst breast -feeding. Since inactivated vaccines cannot replicate they cannot cause infection in either the mother or the f oetus. Although COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca contains a live adenovirus vector, this virus is non -replicating so will not cause infection in the mother or the f oetus. As with most pharmaceutical products, specific clinical trials of coronavirus vaccines in pregnant women have not been carried out. Developmental and reproductivity testing of the Pfizer BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines have not raised any concerns. Adenovirus vectors, similar to those used in the AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccine, have been widely used to vaccinate women against Ebola without raising any concern; formal trials of these vaccines in pregnancy are due to proceed. Although the available data do not indicate any safety concern or harm to pregnancy, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of COVID - 19 Vaccines vaccine during pregnancy. JCVI has advised that vaccination in pregnancy should be considered, however, when the risk of exposure to SARS -CoV-2 infection is high and cannot be avoided, or where the woman has underlying conditions that put them at very high risk of serious complications of COVID -19. In these circumstances, clinicians s hould discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with the woman, who should be told about the absence of safety data for the vaccine in pregnancy. If a woman finds out she is pregnant after she has started a course of vaccine, she may complete vaccinat ion during pregnancy if she is considered at high risk. Alternatively, vaccination should be offered as soon as possible after pregnancy. Note: The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has produced a decision aid to support women to make a pe rsonal informed choice, in discussion with a healthcare professional, about whether to accept a COVID - 19 vaccination in pregnancy (see https://www.rcog.org.uk/covid -vaccine ). Routine questioning about l ast menstrual period and/or pregnancy testing is not required before offering the vaccine. According to JCVI, those who are trying to become pregnant do not need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination. Termination of pregnancy following inadvertent immunisation should not be recommended. Surveillance of inadvertent administration in pregnancy is being conducted for the UK by the PHE Immunisation Department, to whom such cases should be reported at this link: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vaccination - in-pregnancy -vip. As above, women who are inadvertently vaccinated in early pregnancy may be considered for the second dose during pregnancy where the risk of exposure is high or where the woman has underlying conditions that put them at very high risk of serious complicat ions of COVID -19. Breastfeeding It is unknown whether COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is excreted in human milk. There is no known risk associated with giving non -live vaccines whilst breastfeeding. JCVI advises that breastfeeding women may be offered vaccina tion with the Pfizer -BioNTech or AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccines. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the woman's clinical need for immunisation against COVID -19, and the woman should be informed about the a bsence of safety data for the vaccine in breastfeeding women. Version 1.0 Page 17 of 25 Previous incomplete vaccination If the course is interrupted or delayed, it should be resumed using the same vaccine but the first dose should not be repeated. There is no evidence on the interchangeability of the COVID -19 Vaccines although studies are underway. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine which vaccine the individual received and to complete the course with the same vaccine. For individuals who started the schedule and w ho attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule. This option is preferred if the individu al is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again. In these circumstances, as COVID -19 Vaccines are based on the spike protein, it is likely the second dose will help to boost the response to the first dose . STAGE 2: Vaccine Preparation ACTIVITY STAGE 2 : Vaccine preparation Vaccine presentation COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca , solution for injection in COVID -19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1 -S [recombinant]): 5ml of solution in a 10 -dose vial 4ml of solution in an 8-dose vial Supplies A central supply of COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca has been procured in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is supplied as a 4ml multi -dose vial, providing 8 doses per vial or a 5ml multi -dose vial provid ing 10 doses per vial, and supplied with 10 vials per pack. Standard operating procedures should be followed for appropriate storage, handling, preparation, administration and waste minimisation of vaccine. Storage The COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca should be stored at +2\u00baC to +8\u00baC and has a shelf life of 6 months. Do not freeze. The vaccine does not contain any preservative. After first opening the vial, it should be used within 6 hours (and stored between 2\u00baC and 25\u00baC during t he in -use period). After this time, the vial must be discarded. Label vial with the expiry time after first use. Once a dose is withdrawn from the vial it should be administered immediately. Store in original packaging in order to protect from light. The above details relate to storage requirements and available stability data at the time of product authorisation. This may be subject to amendment as more data becomes available. Practitioners should follow the most up to date manufacturer's recommendati ons in the Information for Healthcare Professionals on COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca Version 1.0 Page 18 of 25 Breaches in the cold -chain should be reported in line with local arrangements. Vaccines that have been stored outside of the cold -chain should be quarantined and further advice re use should be sought from the local Trust's Pharmacy Department or Medicines Information Service. Vaccine losses outside of secondary care should be reported to the PHA Duty Room (0300 555 0119) for further risk assessment, including whether patients need revaccination following a cold chain breach. Vaccine preparation Vaccine should be prepared in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations (see Information for Healthcare Professionals on COVID - 19 Vaccine AstraZeneca ) and HSC standard operating procedures for the service. Inspect visually prior to administration and ensure appearance is consistent with the description in the Information for Health care Professionals on COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca , that is a colourless to slightly brown, clear to slightly opaque solution. Discard the vaccine if particulate matter or differences to the described appearance are observed. Do not shake the vial. Check p roduct name, batch number and expiry date prior to administration. Aseptic technique should be used for withdrawing each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml into a syringe for injection to be administered intramuscularly. After first dose withdrawal, use the vial as s oon as practically possible and within 6 hours (stored at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Discard any unused vaccine. A 1ml syringe with a 23g/25g x 25mm needle will be provided for administration. Disposal Equipment used for immunisation, including used vials, ampoules, or discharged vaccines in a syringe or applicator, should be disposed of safely in a UN -approved puncture -resistant 'sharps' box, according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07 -01: Safe management of healthcare waste (Department of Health, 2013). COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca contains genetically m odified organisms (GMOs). Sharps waste and empty vials should be placed into purple lidded waste bins and sent for incineration; there is no need for specific designation as GMO waste. An appropriate virucidal disinfectant should be available for managing spills in all settings where vaccination is administered. Potentially contaminated gloves and aprons can be disposed in yellow/black striped offensive waste bags. Version 1.0 Page 19 of 25 STAGE 3: Vaccine Administration ACTIVITY STAGE 3 : Before administering the vaccine, ensure: 1. the individual has been assessed in accordance with stage one of this protocol 2. the vaccine to be administered has been identified , by the registered practitioner consenting the individual , as COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca 3. consent for vaccination has been provided and documented1 Administer COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and provide any post - vaccination advice. Vaccine to be administered COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca 0.5ml dose Dose and frequency of administration The COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca vaccination course consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each. The second dose should be administered between 4 and 12 weeks after the first dose. The second dose of the vaccine should be routinely scheduled between 4 and 12 weeks after the first dose ( JCVI advises a maximum interval between the first and second do ses of 12 weeks). This will allow more people to benefit from the protection provided from the first dose during the roll out phase. Longer term protection will then be provided by the second dose. See Drug Interactions section for advice on dosing interval for individuals who are about to receive planned immunosuppressive therapy. Individuals may not be fully protected until at least 7 days after their second dose of the vaccine. If the course is interrupted, it should b e resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated. There is no evidence on the interchangeability of the COVID -19 Vaccines although studies are underway. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine which vaccine the individual received and to complete with the same vaccine. For individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer a single dose of the locally a vailable product. This option is preferred if the individual is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again. In these circumstances, as both the vaccines are based on the spike protein, it is likely the second dose will he lp to boost the response to the first dose. For this reason, until additional information becomes available, further doses are not required. Duration of treatment See 'Dose and frequency of administratio n' above. Booster doses of COVID -19 Vaccines are not yet recommended because the need for, and timing of, boosters has not yet been determined. Quantity to be supplied / administered Administer 0.5 ml A two -dose course should be completed (see Dose and frequency of administration ). Version 1.0 Page 20 of 25 Route / method of administration COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is for administration by intramuscular injection only, preferably into deltoid region of the upper arm. Vaccinators should administer a 0. 5ml dose prepared in accordance with Stage 2 above. If vaccine is not drawn up by the vaccinator, safe procedures must be in place for the vaccinator to receive, check , and use the vaccine immediately after prepar ation . Do not shake the vaccine. Check product name, batch number and expiry prior to administration. Inspect visually prior to administration and ensure appearance is consistent with the description in the Regulation 174 Information for UK Healthcare Professionals , that is a colourless to slightly brown, clear to slightly opaque solution. Discard the vaccine if particulate matter or differences to the described appearance are observed. Do not shake the vial. Aseptic technique should be used for withdrawing each vaccine dose of 0.5ml into a syringe for injection to be administered intramuscularly. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual. Each vial contains at least the number of doses stated. It is normal for liquid to remain in the vial after withdrawing the final dose. When low dead volume syringes and/or needles are used, the amount remaining in the vial may be sufficient for an additional dose. Care should be taken to ensure a full 0. 5ml dose is administered. Where a full 0. 5ml dose cannot be extracted , the remaining volume should be discarded. The vaccine does not contain any preservative. After first dose withdrawal, use the vial as soon as practically possible and within 6 hours (stored at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Discard any unused vaccine. The site at which each vaccine was given should be noted in the individual's records. As with other intramuscular injections, COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia, any coagulation disorder or to persons on anticoagulation therapy, because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramus cular administration in these individuals. According to the Green Book , individuals with bleeding disorders may be vaccinated intramuscularly if, in the opinion of a doctor familiar with the individual's bleeding risk, vaccines or similar small volume intramuscular injections can be administered with reasonable safety by this route. If the individual receives medication/ treatment to reduce bleeding, for example treatment for haemophilia, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such medication/treatment is administered. Individuals on stable anticoagulation therapy, including individuals on warfarin who are up - to-date with their scheduled INR testi ng and whose latest INR is below the upper level of the therapeutic range, can receive intramuscular vaccination. A fine needle (23 or 25 gauge) should be used for the vaccination, followed by firm pressure applied to the site without rubbing for at least 2 minutes (ACIP 2019). The individual/parent/carer should be informed about the risk of haematoma from the injection . Version 1.0 Page 21 of 25 Disposal Equipment used for immunisation, including used vials, ampoules, or discharged vaccines in a syringe or applicator, should be disposed of safely in a UN -approved puncture -resistant 'sharps' box, according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07 -01: Safe management of healthcare waste (Department of Health, 2013). COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca contains genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Sharps waste and empty vials should be placed into purple lidded waste bins and sent for incineration; there is no need for specific designation as GMO waste. An appropriate virucidal disin fectant should be available for managing spills in all settings where vaccination is administered. Potentially contaminated gloves and aprons can be disposed in yellow/black striped offensive waste bags. Observation following vaccination Recipients of COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca should be observed for any immediate reactions , ideally for 15 minutes, but as a minimum recipients should be observed for the period they are receiving any post -immunisation information and subsequent appointment if required. As syncope (fainting) can occur following vaccination, all vaccinees should either be driven by someone else or should not drive for 15 minutes after vaccination. For patients with a history of immediate anaphylaxis to multiple, different drug classes, with the trigger unidentified (this may indicate PEG allergy) or a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, injected antibody preparation or a medicine likely to contain PEG (e.g. depot steroid injection, laxative) or a history of idiopathic anaphyl axis, the vaccine should be administered following the advice of an allergy specialist, in a setting with full resuscitation facilities (e.g. a hospital), and a 30 minute observation period is recommended. Patients who experienced an immediate -type allergi c reaction to the first dose of COVID -19 Vaccine, where symptoms were limited to swelling or rash local to the injection site only, can have the second dose using the same vaccination in any vaccination setting. Observe the patient for 30 minutes. Patients who experienced delayed urticaria / angioedema to the first dose of COVID -19 Vaccine, where the reaction was self -limiting or resolved with oral antihistamine, can have the second dose using the same vaccination in any setting. Consider pre -treatment with non-sedating antihistamine, 3 0 minutes prior to vaccination. Post -vaccination advice Ensure the individual has been provided appropriate written information such as the: Regulation 174 Information for UK recipients for COVID -19 Vaccine AstraZeneca COVID -19 Vaccination Record Card What to expect after your COVID -19 vaccination Version 1.0 Page 22 of 25 STAGE 4: Recording vaccine adminstration ACTIVITY STAGE 4: Complete a record of vaccination for the individual and in accordance with local policy. The required records should be completed by the person who is undertaking the recorded activity or a designated record keeper who is a witness to the activity undertaken. Records (continued over page) Verbally confirm individual's name, address, date of birth, HSC number (for healthcare professionals) and Record data required by the data capture form (including): that valid informed consent was given or a decision to vaccinate made in the individual's best int erests in accordance with the common law in Northern Ireland in relation to the best interests of the incapacitous individual clinical risk group indication for immunisation if applicable name of immuniser name and brand of vaccine date of administration dose, form and route of administration of vaccine quantity administered batch number and expiry date anatomical site of vaccination advice given, including advice given if excluded or declines immunisation details of any adverse drug reactions and actions taken , supplied and administered via this Vaccination Protocol Records should be signed and dated by the practitioner. All records should be clear, legible and contemporaneous. It is important that vaccinations given either at a general practice or elsewhere are recorded on appropriate health records for the individual (using the appropriate clinical code) in a timely manner. If given elsewhere, systems should be in place to ensure a record of vaccination is returned to the individual's general pract ice to allow clinical follow up and to avoid duplicate vaccination. A record of all individuals receiving treatment under this Protocol should also be kept for audit purposes in accordance with local policy. Version 1.0 Page 23 of 25 5.
