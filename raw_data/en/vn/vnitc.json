Toxins are all around us and it is impossible to avoid exposure completely. Since the beginning of the industrial age 100 years ago, we are bombarded with dangerous toxins in our environment. In addition, thousands of toxic chemicals have been introduced through the use of household cleaners, dental and physical hygiene products and pharmaceuticals. We have also acquired a taste for coffee, caffeine, carbonated drinks, tobacco products, alcohol, fast foods, processed foods, an abundance of meat, refined & artificial sugars and sweets. All of these factors stray away from our original design and cleansing the body is needed now more than ever. These toxins affect our health, disturb our bodily functions and cover up our true nature (Prakruti). Thankfully, the body has the daily ability to naturally detoxify itself. We process and eliminate toxins through the help of the digestive system, skins, lungs, blood, lymph and many other organs. What is a toxin? Something is named a toxin if the body is not able to naturally break it down in digestion and elimination. Toxins will then build up and eventually hinder our natural bodily functions. This may also lead to disease. We can also accumulate toxins through lack of exercise, lifestyle, habits, diet, etc. All of these factors can impact us over time. This, in turn, may worsen our condition, as we begin to crave the things that do not serve us. \"One should not use food articles from either attachment or ignorance; rather he should use wholesome ones after examination; the body is a product of food\" - Caraka Samhita Early Signs of Toxic Overload: - Low Energy - Lethargy - Generalized Aches and Pains - Lack of Mental Clarity - Heaviness in the body - Weight Gain - Digestive Problems (Gas, Constipation, Bloating) - Weakened Immune System - Frequent Colds and Sinus Infections - Coated Tongue - Body Odor Detox, Refresh, and Renew Your Body & Mind There are 5 Main Toxins to Consider: - One type of toxin that accumulates in the body is called AMA, yet it is not dangerous. It literally means \"uncooked\" or \"undigested\". This results from a heavy diet and/or poor digestion and undigested food. Signs of AMA is a coated tongue or strong body odor. - AMA that sits within the physiology for a long period of time becomes acidic. It may also harden and block channels and begin to ferment, becoming a reactive substance. - The toxic buildup from chemical substances, environmental pollution, etc. that settles into joints and organs. - Electromagnetic toxicity, radiation, microwave, cell phones, etc. - Mental AMA: Unprocessed Emotions Additional Considerations during Menstruation A menstruating woman should not perform purgation. If cycle comes during cleanse time, she can continue on the kitchari diet and other self-care practices, but will suspend purgation. 14 Days - 3 Phases A complete at-home Ayurvedic detoxification routine involves 4 phases \u2014 preparation, cleansing, purgation and post-cleansing. I offer customized and practical guidelines for each phase. Preparation (7 Days) #1 Attempt to clear your schedule for the Active Phase as much as possible to practice REST Start a routine of Toxin-Free foods and self-care lifestyle practices in preparation for an effective cleanse This week you will gather supplies and adapt to what the Active Cleansing phase will be like. Active Cleansing (7 Days) - May Be Extended If You Wish To Do So ~ Ask Me for Details ~ I will provide details of your individual plan, based on your Dosha. This may, or may not, include purgation on the last day of the active phase. This week includes a mono diet of fresh foods, based on your Doshic profile and daily morning and evening routines of Self-Care. Purgation Day A gentle purgation will be done by instruction, based on Doshic profile Post-Cleansing - Reintroduction & Rejuvenation (Lifetime) After cleansing, you may feel much lighter, more blissful, and more energetic with newfound vitality! You may even have shed some unwanted pounds. Give yourself time to gradually transition into your normal routine and eating habits. Gradually add heavier foods to your diet, and be sure to get enough rest for a few days after cleansing is over. Follow your normal Ayurvedic routine. Take Herbal Rasayanas (Ayurvedic rejuvenation formulas). Now that the channels of your body that deliver nutrients are clear, these Rasayanas will deeply nourish and rejuvenate your entire physiology. What To Expect This style of cleanse is much less provoking than many forms of cleansing and is generally safer for a diverse range of constitutions and imbalances. That said, an Ayurvedic cleanse tends to move long-standing imbalances into circulation so that they can be eliminated. This is how our bodies repair themselves when we afford them the opportunity. As a result, a cleanse has the potential to be exhausting, emotionally taxing, and physically uncomfortable - but that is not always the case for everyone. This cleanse is gentle and should not cause a great deal of discomfort. Nevertheless, it is better to be prepared for some ups and downs than to expect to feel fabulous throughout your cleanse. You should begin to experience the deeper benefits of the cleanse within a few days to a week after completing it, if not sooner. For women of childbearing age, the first menstrual cycle following a cleanse is an important part of the process, and can deliver a meaningful sense of completion to the cleanse. As a result, the fullest expression of positive change may not be experienced by these women until one or two menstrual cycles after the cleanse is complete. This process can also stir up unresolved emotions so it is important to be prepared for some emotional cleansing. It is quite common to have unexpected and somewhat unexplainable emotions crop up during a cleanse. Ideally, we would simply witness these states as they arise, creating space to honor, move, and release our feelings in a healthy way. The emotional aspects of a cleanse can make it especially important to enlist a loving support team for your cleansing process.
