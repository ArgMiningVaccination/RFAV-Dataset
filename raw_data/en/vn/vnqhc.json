We anticipate the release of a new COVID-19 adult vaccine in the Fall 2023, which should offer improved efficacy and additional benefits. We will resume COVID-19 adult vaccinations at that time. During this temporary suspension period, patients can still obtain the COVID-19 adult vaccine at their local pharmacies, which are well-equipped and have the necessary resources to administer the vaccine safely and efficiently. We will keep you updated on the exact dates and procedures for adult vaccination as soon as we receive more information on the upcoming vaccine release. What is COVID-19? Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infection that can cause mild to severe respiratory illness. The Signs and Symptoms of Coronavirus are: - Fever or chills - Cough - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - Fatigue - Muscle or body aches - Headache - Sore throat - New loss of taste or smell - Congestion or runny nose - Nausea or vomiting - Diarrhea If you believe you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, we encourage you to visit our walk-in care locations (Urgent Care South, Urgent Care Main or XpressCare Highlands) for testing and care. In the absence of severe symptoms, you may be encouraged to self-isolate. If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or other potentially life-threatening issues, you should go to the nearest emergency room or call 911. Prevention To prevent illness, the CDC recommends individuals and families follow everyday preventive measures: - Voluntary Home Isolation: Stay home when you are sick and avoid contact with individuals who are sick. Put distance between yourself and other people as much as possible when out in public. - Respiratory Etiquette: Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw it in the trash can. - Hand Hygiene: Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60%-95% alcohol. - Environmental Health Action: Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects daily. Treatment There is an incubation period of two - 10 days.
