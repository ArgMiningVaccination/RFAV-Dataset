Balance Integrative Medicine also offers free 20-minute phone consultations to help patients determine which treatment options are best for them. Dr. Ilyas Hamid is a licensed acupuncturist and completed his Doctorate Degree in 2019. His thesis, 'The Parallels of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Psycho-Neuro-Endocrine-Immunology: Correlating Pathophysiology, Allostatic Load, and Integrative Therapy,' explains how genetics and epigenetics are the main contributors to illness and death, how this concept is understood from a Chinese Medicine perspective and the kinds of therapies necessary to reverse genetics and prevent disease. His research is also the science behind Dr. Joe Dispenza and Dr. Bruce Lipton's teachings. Specialty Stress/Anxiety Depression Arthritis Autoimmune Disease Pain Management Gastrointestinal Disease Adrenal Stress and Fatigue Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Insomnia Imagecold & Flu Contact Business Reviews I made an appointment with Dr. Ilyas while on a three day vacation in Hollywood, and I am sooo glad I did. I had terrible neck pain and didn't want to spend my vacation suffering. Ilyas was generous with his time, knowledge, and energy, even though he knew I wasn't local. He used three different techniques, including cupping (yum) and acupuncture, and by the end of the visit, my neck pain had abated and my whole body felt open and more balanced. Ilyas' training includes both Western nutrition/fitness and Chinese medicine, and he is learning new things all the time. His team (hi, Walker!) clearly cares deeply about its patients. There are so many reasons I want to move to Hollywood, and continuing to get treatment from Ilyas is now also on the list. Dr. Ilyas is an excellent holistic doctor. My husband has been struggling with long COVID and a reactivation of EBV. Dr. Ilyas has been guiding us through the treatment process. Dr. IIyas is kind, compassionate, and very knowledgeable. My husband has improved so much over the last few months, and is on the road to a full recovery. Ilyas Hamid is knowledgeable and profoundly gifted and caring in his profession and personally. I have experienced three acupuncture appointments with Ilyas and my constant back pain has been reduced significantly. I will continue the sessions and look forward to living each day without pain. Thank you Ilyas.
