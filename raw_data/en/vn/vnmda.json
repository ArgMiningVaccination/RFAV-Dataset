What I mean by that is that - according to my guest on this podcast - if you introduce a foreign substance, your body's immune system will mount a response - and often, that response can have negative health consequences. From steroids to even everyday legal compounds, these unrecognizable elements may lead to severe autoimmune disease, gut problems, cancer, and more. Certain supplements and chemicals can also make you age faster because they interfere with your natural biological processes, temporarily or even permanently altering them. When I was in Miami recently, I decided to drop in (specifically, on a scooter I rode from the beach) and talk to a relatively new friend of mine, Dr. Marcos De Andrade, who goes by \"Dr. De\". We met at the facility in Miami that Dr. De founded called [Biohax](https://biohax.com). The services at Biohax include complete biochemical analyses with panels designed to look at different concerns such as performance, mood, and toxin exposure. Based on those results, the \"health magicians\" at Biohax apply what they call their \"4R Strategy\" to remove inflammatory agents, replenish micronutrients, reinoculate your gut, and recover through sleep and therapeutics. Dr. De and I did a brief [Instagram Live together](https://www.instagram.com/tv/Cl9yjKCqP40/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) at the end of last year, during which we talked about his areas of expertise, including steroids, hormones, peptides, and more. Although he doesn't practice medicine right now, Dr. De received a Doctorate in Medicine (M.D.) in a hybrid program from the U.S. and Europe at the Medical University of Silesia in Poland. He then obtained an MBA from Nova International Business Administration with a concentration in Finance. Lastly, he went on to complete a research fellowship at the prestigious Cleveland Clinic in Weston Florida in the department of surgery and metabolism. So, needless to say, the guy is legit. Through his own journey of self-improvement, Dr. De began to understand the impact of his biochemical footprint on his life outcomes - inspiring him to found [Biohax](https://biohax.com) and its mission: helping others become their best selves. His goal is to create a worldwide system of talented health professionals that can help people everywhere live healthier and more fulfilling lifestyles. By providing valuable services tailored for each individual, Dr. De hopes that together they can achieve a life filled with purposeful potential. In this discussion with Dr. De, we open up his thoughts on the Liver King controversy (a topic I haven't spoken much about on a podcast yet), growth hormones, how to regenerate your thymus gland, and much more. We also answer more Instagram Live questions. I hope you have as much fun listening as I did recording!
