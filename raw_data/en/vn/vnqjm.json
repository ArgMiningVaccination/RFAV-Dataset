These Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ s) are intended to clarify allowable uses of funds a nd describe how these funds may be used to impleme nt actionable s trategies to meet the urgent needs of students and educators as LEAs and school s work to return to and safely sustain in -person instruction , address the education al inequities that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic , and address students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs . The document is divided into the following sections: A. Overview of ESSER and GEER funds . B. Reopening schools safely and promoting the health and safety of students, staff, and the school community . C. Advancing educational equity in COVID -19 response . D. Using ESSER and GEER funds to support e ducators and other school staff . E. Additional fiscal considerat ions. The technical a ppendix (Appendix A) addressing how an SEA must make formula subgrants to LEAs under ARP ESSER and ESSER II is included at the end of this document. The Department encourag es States and LEAs to use the funds described in this document to safely reopen schools, maximize i n-person instructional time for all students, and provide opportunities to address the impacts of lost instructional time resulting from the COVID -19 pandemi c. When making decisions about how to use ESSER and GEER funds, States and LEAs are encouraged to t ake into consideration how the funds can be used to address inequities, including focusing supports and services on students from low - income families , studen ts of color, students with disabilities, English learners, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care , migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic . The December 2022 update notes the questions that have been updated and those which are new. Not noted are som e small technical and editorial changes that have been made to other quest ions, including updated links to resources that have become available since the May 2021 Use of Funds FAQs were issued. The December 2022 update also includes a new Appendix B of pre viously published standalone ESSER and GEER FAQs. Other useful information the ESSER a nd GEER programs, including States' certifications and agreements, allocation amounts, State plans, and Fact Sheets, can be found on the ESSER and GEER websites. The Deadlines and Announcements page also includes grant administration and pol icy guidance sent via the Department's Grant s administration platform (G5). Finally, we want to highlight that while ESSER or GEER fu nds may continue to be used to maintain safe, in -person learning for all students, some strategies and approaches for doing so have changed over time as recommendation s have evolved. This document continues to reflect permitted uses of funds over the cours e of the ESSER and GEER programs and provide transparency to help stakeholders, including parents, understand the use of ES SER and GEER funds starting on March 13, 202 0, and going forward. 11 Overview of ESSER and GEER Funds Generally, in determining wheth er an activity is an allowable use of funds, a State or LEA must determine: Is the use of funds intended to prevent, prepare for, or respond to the COVID -19 pandemic , including its impact on the social, emotional , mental health , and academic needs of stu dents ?1 Does the use of funds fall under one of the authorized uses of ESSER or GEER funds? Is the use of funds permissible under the Uniform Administrative Requirements, C ost Principles, and Audit Requirements fo r Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance, 2 CFR Part 200 )? In particular, is it necessary and reasonable for the performance of the ESSER or GEER award ? These Federal emergency resources are available for a wide range of activities to address diverse needs arising from or exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic , or to emerge stronger post-pandemic , including responding to student s' social, emotional, mental health , and academic need s and continuing to provide educational ser vices as States, LEAs, and schools re spond to and recover from the pandemic. Some uses of these funds may be directly focused on health and safety \u2014such as improving ventilation and implementing prevention strategies that are , to the extent practicable , consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) guidance. Other a llowable uses may be focused on meeting the social, emotional, mental health , and academic needs of students . That could be through preventing teacher layoffs; providing acc elerated learning opportunities ; implementing rigorous curricul a; funding addition al counselors, school nurses, and school psychologists ; increasing the number of full-service community schoo ls; conducting any activities allowed under a number of Federal e ducation programs (see FAQ A-3); and implementing many other allowable uses as illu strated in this document . Allocating resources in ways that advance equity and ensuring they are adequate f or providing the opportunities and supports students need to succ eed are particularly important as we recover from the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on communities of color and communities experiencing poverty. Addressing the many dimensions of resource equity \u2014including equitable and adequate school f unding ; access to a well -rounded education ; well-prepared, effective, and diverse educators and staff ; and integrated support services \u2014can begin to mitigate the impact of COVID -19 on schools and students and can close long -standing gaps in educational oppo rtunity. A-1. What funds are covered in th ese FAQ s? These FAQ s address f ive progr ams in the Educatio n Stabilization Fund (ESF) to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID -19 emergency : \"ESSER I\": The ESSER Fund established in the CARES Act . \"ESSER II\": The additional funding for ESSER provided in the CRRSA Act. \"ARP ESSER \": The additional funding for ESSER provided in the ARP Act. \"GEER I\": The GEER Fund established in the CARES Act. \"GEER II\": The additional funding for GEER provided in the CRRSA Act. References to ESSER apply to ESSER I, ESSER II, and ARP ESSER . References to GEER apply to GEER I and GEER II. 1 See Appendix B, Section 5 f or more information on what it means to \"prevent, prepare for, or respond to COVID - 19.\" 12 Please note that GEER funds may be used for childcare, pre-K-12 education , adult education, and higher education support. However, these FAQs are mainly focused on the use of GEER funds for pre-K-12 education . We also a cknowledge that GEER and ESSER SEA Reserve funds may be awarded to entities other than LEAs.2 However, because the vast majority of funds under the CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP Act are awa rded to LEAs and LEAs are the entities responsible for reopening sc hools safely and addressing educational needs impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic , this guidance focuses primarily on LEA uses of ESSER and GEER funds. It should be noted that GEER and ESSER SEA Reserve funds may be used for all of the allowable activities o utlined in this guidance. ESSER Formula Funds to LEAs A-2. How do es an SEA allocate ESSER formula funds to LEAs ? Each SEA must allocate at least 90 percent of the ESSER funds it receives as subgrants to LEAs in proportion to the amount of funds each LE A received under part, A of t itle I of the ESEA in the most recent fiscal year (FY )\u2014i.e., FY 2019 (ESSER I) or FY 2020 (ARP ESSER and ESSER II) . (For more information on allocating funds to LEAs under ARP ESSER and ESSER II , see the Technical Appendix at the end of this document. ) A-3. How may an LEA use ESSER funds? An LEA may use ESSER funds for the broad range of activities listed in section 18003(d) of the CARES Act, section 313(d) of the CRRSA Act , and section 2001(e) of the ARP Act . Although the lis ts of allowable uses of funds are not identical, any of the ESSER funds (ESSER I, ESSER II, or ARP ESSER) may be used to support all of the allowable uses of funds listed in any of the ESSER programs . We have consolidated below the three ESSER programs' li sts of allowable uses of funds. The activities that are listed in section 18003(d) of the CARES Act, section 313(d) of the CRRSA Act, and section 2001(e) of the ARP Act th at an LEA may support with ESSER funds are: 1.

Although the CARES, CRRSA, and ARP Acts use the term, \"children with disabilities\" with respe ct to the allowable activity of providing activities to address the unique needs of certain groups of students, ESSER funds may be used to sup port students with disabilities under both the IDEA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In some ins tances, this document refers to children with disabilities where the CARES, CRRSA, or ARP Acts use that term to set forth a requirement. Howev er, even in instances where the CARES, CRRSA, or ARP Acts require funds to be used for ch ildren with disabilities, an SEA or LEA may also use its ESSER funds to support students with disabilities under section 504. 6 The reference to full -service communit y schools is only in the ARP Act, but ESSER I and ESSER II funds may also be used for tha t purpose. Please note th at, as described later in this document, ESSER funds can be used to hire a broad range of professionals who deliver mental health services and supports, including but not limited to nurses, counselors, psychologists, and social wor kers. 14 disabilities , English learners, migrant students, students experiencing homelessness, and children and youth in foster care. 16.

Providing information and assistance to parents a nd families on how they can effectively support students, including in a distance learning environment. d. Tracking student attendance and improving student engagement in dista nce education.8 17. School facility repairs and improvements to enable operation of sc hools to re duce risk of virus transmission and exposure to environmental health hazards, and to support student health needs. 18. Inspection, testing, maintenance, repair, repl acement, and upgrade projects to improve the indoor air quality in school facilitie s, including mechanical and non -mechanical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, filtering, purification and other air cleaning, fans, control systems, and window and door repair and replacement. 19. Developing strategies and implementi ng public health protocols including, to the greatest extent practicable, policies in line with guidance from the CDC for the reopening and operation of school facilities to effectiv ely maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other staff.9 20. Other activities that are necessary to maintain the operation of and continuity of services in the LEA and continuing to employ existing staff of the LEA.10 In determining how to prioritize its funds, an LEA should consider how to use those funds to safely reopen schools for full-time instruction for all students, maintain safe in -person operations, advance educational equity , and build capacity . An LEA may provide services direct ly or enter into an agreement (e.g., a contract or interagency agreement consistent with procurement requirements or otherwise legally authorized ) for allowable activities under ESSER. An LEA is not authorized to award subgrants with ESSER funds. 7 For the purposes of this guidance document , the term \"academic impact of lost instructional time\" is used in place of \"learning loss \" experienced by students a s a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, as referenced in the ARP Act and the CRRSA Act. 8 This activity, as well as t he next two, are not explicitly listed in the CARES Act but are still allowable uses of ESSER I funds. 9 This activity is only listed in the A RP Act but is an allowable use of ESSER I and ESSER II funds. 10 As described later in thi s document, this includes using ESSER funds to avoid layoffs. 15 A-4. Does ARP ESSER include any new provisions for LEAs that ESSER I and ESSER II do not ? Yes. The ARP ESSER statute and interim final requirements include several new provisions for LEAs to support school reopening , safe school operations, and support for students : Safe Return to In -Person Instruction and Continuity of Services . Section 2001( i) of the ARP Act requires an LEA that receive s ARP ESSER funds to develop and make publicly availab le on the LEA's website , within 30 days after receiving its allocation , a plan for the safe retur n to in - person instruction and continui ty of services. Prior to making the p lan publicly available, the LEA must seek public comment on the plan and take such comments into consideration when developing the plan. Under the interim final requirements, an LEA plan for safe return to in - person instruction and continuity of services must describe how the LEA will maintain the health and safety of students, educators , and other staff and the extent to which it has adopted policies, and a description of any such policies, on each of the prevention and mitigation strategies recommend ed by the CDC . 11The plan must also describe how an LEA will ensure continuity of service s, which must address students' academic needs and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs, and which may include student health and food servi ces. In addition , the LEA must regularly, but no less frequently than every six mon ths (taking i nto consideration the timing of significant changes to CDC guidance on reopening schools), review and, as appropriate, revise its plan for the safe return to in -person instruction and continuity of services , and must seek and take public input into account in determining whether and what revisions are necessary. An LEA that developed a school reopening and continuity of services plan prior to the date of enactmen t of the ARP Act and t hat meets the above requirements for public comment will be d eemed in comp liance but, within no more than six months, the LEA must review and, if necessary, revise the plan to meet the requirements of the interim final requirements . Reservation to Address the Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time . Section 200 1(e)(1) of the ARP Act r equires an LEA to reserve not less than 20 percent of its ARP ESSER allocation to address the academic impact of lost instructional time through the implementation of evidence - based interventions (e.g., providing intensive or high -dosage tutoring or accelerating learning ; see FAQ A-10 for a de finition of evidence -based ), such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehen sive after -school programs, or extended school year programs, and ensure that the interventions implemented respond to students' social, emotional , mental health , and academic needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on students from low - income familie s, students of color , children with disabilities, English learners, migratory stude nts, students experiencing homelessness, and child ren and youth in foster care. While ESSER I and ESSER II funds may also be used for these purposes, an LEA is not required to set aside a specific amount of ESSER I and ESSER II funds to address the academi c impact of lost instructional time . Effective strategies to address the impact of lost instructional time are further 11 Specifically, the LEA plan must address the extent to which it has adopted policies, and a descriptio n of any policies, on each of the CDC's recommendations on: universal and correct wearing of masks; modifying faci lities to allow for physical distancing (e.g., use of cohorts/podding); handwashing and respiratory etiquette; cleaning and maintaining health y facilities, including improving ventilation; contact tracing in combination with isolat ion and quarantine, in co llaboration with the State, local, territorial, or Tribal health departments; diagnostic and screening testing; efforts to provide vaccination s to school communities; appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities with r espect to health and safe ty policies; and coordination with State and local health officials. 16 described in Volume 2 of the Department 's COVID -19 Han dbook available at: https://www2.ed.gov/documents/coronavirus/reopening -2.pdf . Maintenance of Equity for High -Poverty Schools . Section 2004 (c) of the ARP Act stipulates that an LEA , as a condition of receiv ing ARP ESSER funds , may not , in FY 2022 or 2023 : o Reduce the combined State and local per -pupil funding for any high -poverty school served by the LEA by an amount that exceeds the total reduction in LEA funding (from combined S tate and local funding) , if any, for all schools serv ed by the LEA in such fiscal y ear divided by the number of children enrolled in all schools served by the LEA in such fiscal year; or o Reduce the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) staff per-pupil in an y high -poverty school by an amount that exceeds the total reduction in the number o f FTEs per-pupil , if any, in all schools served by the LEA in such fiscal year divided by the n umber of children enrolled in all schools served by the LEA in such fiscal yea r. A \"high-poverty school \" means a school in the highest quartile of schools served by an LEA based on the percentage of economically disadvantaged students served . More information can be found on the Department's Maintenance of Equity Use of ARP ESSER Funds . Under the interim final require ments, each LEA that receives ARP ESSER funds must develop a plan for its use of ARP E SSER funds and submit it to the SEA within a reasonable timeline determined by the SEA. The plan must contain, at a minimum, the extent to which and how the funds will be used to implement prevention and mitigation strategies that are, to the extent practi cable, consistent with CDC guidance ; how the LEA will use the funds it reserves under s ection 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act to address the academic impact of lost instruction al time ; how the LEA will use its remaining ARP ESSER funds ; and how the LEA will ensu re the interventions it implements will respond to the social, emotional, mental health , and academic needs of all students and particularly those students disproportiona tely impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic . In developing its plan, an LEA must engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders including students ; families ; school and district administrators (including special education administrators); and teachers, pri ncipals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions . An LEA must also engage in meaningful consultation with each of the following to the extent present in or served by th e LEA: Tribes; civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations); and stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migra tory students, children who are incarcerated , and other underser ved students. An LEA should translate relevant materials and obtain the services of interpreters , as needed , to engage its English learner s and families with limited English proficiency . An LE A must provide the public the opportunity to provide input on the development of the plan , take such input into account , and post the LEA ARP ESSER plan on its website . The interim final requirements , which contain information on the LEA plan, can be LE As required to periodically review their ARP ESSER safe return to in -person instruction and continuity of services plans? (New December 7, 2022 ) Yes. Under ARP ESSER requir ements, an LEA receiving an allocation of funds through the ARP ESSER formula was required to develo p a safe return to in -person instruction and continuity of services plan and to regularly, but no less frequently than every six months througho ut the progr am period, review and, as appropriate, revise that plan. An LEA must seek and take public input into account in determining whether and what revisions are necessary. If, after conducting the review and taking into account public input, the LEA may determin e that no revisions are necessary. As with all decisions related to ESSER funds, an LEA should be tr ansparent and communicate to the public its determination that revisions are not necessary. A-4.b. In meeting the ARP ESSER requirement to use at least 20 percent of its ARP ESSER allocation to address the academic impact of lost instructional time and ad dress the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on underserved populations, may an LEA include the costs associated with implementing an evidence -based strate gy that advances this purpose? (New December 7, 2022 ) Yes, the cost of providing services to students to address the academic impact of lost instructional time and address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on underserved populations may include reasonabl e and necessary activities to help implement an evidence -based strategy for advancing this purpose. For example, such costs might include expenses associated with professional development, cleaning the space where a program is held, providing snacks o r mea ls to students who are staying at school late to participate in the enrichment activity, or transportation. A-5. Is there a deadline by which an SEA must award ESSER funds to LEAs? Yes. An SEA must award ESSER I and ESSER II funds within one year o f receiving the award , pursuant to section 18003(f) of the CARES Act and section 313(g) of the CRRSA Act. Given that these funds are intended to address urgent needs arising from the COVID -19 pandemic, SEAs are urged to award funds to LEA s as expeditiously as possible. Pursuant to section 2001( d)(2) of the ARP Act, an SEA must a ward ARP ESSER funds in an expedited and t imely manner and, to the extent practicable, not later than 60 days after the SEA receives the award. An SEA that is not able to allocate such funds within 60 days because it is not practicable (e.g., because of pre -existing State board approval requiremen ts) must provide an explanation to the Department within 30 days of receiving each portion of its ARP ESSER funds, including a description of specific actions the SEA is taking to provide ARP ESSER funds to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and the SE A's expected timeline for doing so. If an SEA does not award ESSER I , ESSER II, or ARP ESSER funds within one year of receipt , it must return the funds to the Department for reallocation. A-6. May an SEA or a State legislature limit an LEA 's use of ESSE R formula funds? No. Section 18003(d) of the CARES Act, section 313(d) of the CRRSA Act, and section 2001(e)(2 ) of the ARP Act permit an L EA to use ESSER funds for a broad range of allowable activities . Each section authorizes an LEA to use ESSER funds \"f or any of the following\" activities. Accordingly, neither an SEA nor a State legislature has the authority to limit an LEA's use of ESSER f ormula f unds. An SEA may require LEA s to include information in their applications about how they intend to use the f unds , 18 consistent with the SEA's regular practices or State law, as long as it does not limit how the LEAs use their funds. A-7. May an SEA or a State legislature limit how long an LEA has to access or spend its ESSER formula funds? No. Under the statute, LEAs are authorized to obligate funds throughout the period of availability of those funds and, consistent with cash management requiremen ts (e.g., the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) and the Uniform Guidance requirements), draw down funds in accor dance with their needs. ESSER Funds Reserved at the SEA Level A-8. May an SEA re serve any ESSER I and II funds for the SEA's use? Yes. An SEA may retain up to 10 percent of its ESSER I and ESSER II funds (the \"SEA Reserve\") to address emergency needs , as determined by the SEA , resulting from the COVID -19 pandemic , which may be addres sed through the use of subgrants or contracts. An SEA ma y reserve \u00bd of 1 percent or less of its total ESSER I and ESSER II allocations for administrative costs, including bo th direct and indirect administrative costs. This reservation must come from the SE A Reserve. (See FAQs E -4 through E -9 for more informatio n on administrative funds.) Unlike ARP ESSER funds (see FAQ A-9), however, an SEA is not required to retain any ESSER I or ESSER II funds at the State level. A-9. May an SEA reserve any ARP ESSER fun ds for the SEA's use? Yes. In fact, u nder section 2001( f) of the ARP Act, an SEA is required to reserve ARP ESSER funds for three State -level reservations for evidence -based activi ties and interventions (see FAQ A-10) that respond to students' social, emo tional , mental health , and academic needs and address th e disproportiona te impact of COVID -19 on students from low -income families, students of color, English learners, chil dren with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students.12 The academic impac t of lost instructional time . Not less than 5 percent of the State's grant must be reserved to carry out, directly or through subgrants or contracts, activities to address the academic imp act of lost instructional time by supporting the implementation of e vidence -based interventions . Summer enrichment . Not less than 1 percent of the State's grant must be reserved to carr y out, directly or through subgrants or contract s, the implementation of evidence -based summer enrichment programs . After -school programs . Not less than 1 percent of the State's grant must be reserved to carry out, directly or through subgrants or contra cts, the implementation of evidence -based comprehensive after -school programs . In addition, not more than \u00bd of 1 percent of the State's to tal ARP ESSER award may be reserved for administrative costs . The remainder , if any, of funds not allocated to LEAs or reserved for mandatory set - 12 ARP ESSER funds are being made available to SEAs in two portions: the first, totaling two -thirds of an SEA's allocation, was made available on March 24, 2021; t he second, constituting t he remaining one -third of an SEA's allocation, will be made available after the Department approves a State plan submitted by the SEA. All per centages apply to an SEA's total ARP ESSER allocation, and may be reserved from either or a combination of both po rtions of its ARP ESSER award. 19 asides or admini strative costs (up to 3 percent , depending on the amount otherwise reserved ) may be used for emergency needs as determined by the SEA to address issues responding to COVID -19. A-10. What does it mean for a prog ram to be evidence -based? The ARP Act defines the term \"evidence -based \" as having the meaning in section 8101 (21) of the ESEA . Accordingly , . Specifically, \"evidence -based,\" when used with respect to a St ate, LEA, or school activity, means an activity, strategy , or intervention that: Demonstrates a statistically significant effect on improv ing student outcomes or other relevant outcomes based on \u2014 o Strong evidence from at least one well -designed and well -implemented experimental study (\"tier 1\"); o Moderate evidence from at least one well -designed and well -implemented quasi - experimental study ( \"tier 2\"); or o Promising evidence from at least one well -designed and well -implemented correlational study with statis tical controls for selection bias (\"tier 3\"); or Demonstrates a rationale based on high -quality research findings or positive evaluation t hat such activity, strategy, or intervention is likely to improve student outcomes or other relevant outcomes and inc ludes ongoing efforts to exam ine the effects of such activity, strategy, or intervention (\"tier 4\"). Given the novel context created by th e COVID -19 pandemic, an activity need not have generated such evidence during the COVID -19 pandemic to be considered evidence -based. The Department's What Works Clearinghouse (available at https://ies.ed.gov/n cee/wwc/ ) identifies the tier of evidence that reviewed studies meet, as applicable. As part of th e \"demonstrates a rationale (tier 4)\" level of evidence, grantees may develop and use approaches that are novel, if they are consistent with theoretical and empirical findings from research and the grantee will continue to review the effects of the practic e to build the evi dence base. Developing a logic model can help to demonstrate a rationale. Logic model resources are available at https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/paci fic/elm.asp . An SEA should con sider using funds to provide technical assistance to its LEAs on identifying and implementing evidence -based interventions. SEAs can also r eview the Department's guidance on using evidence, which can be found here: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/guidanceuseseinvestment.pdf . Finally, SEAs should make use of the federally funded Comprehensive Center network . A-11. Must an SEA engage in mea ningful consultation before determining how to use the ARP ESSER funds it reserves ? Yes. Each SEA is required to subm it to the Department a State Plan for ARP ESSER funds (ARP ESSER State Plan) that includes , among other requirements, a description of how it will use the funds it reserves. As required in the interim final requirements, an SEA must engage in meaningful co nsultation with stakeholders, and provide the public the opportunity to provide input, in the development of the plan . Specifically, in the development of its ARP ESSER State Plan, an SEA must engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders including , but not limited to, students; families; Tribes (if applicable); civil rights organizations (including disability righ ts organizations); school and district administrators (including special education administrators); superintend ents; charter school leaders (if applicable), teachers, principals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions ; and stakehol ders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homeless ness, children in foster car e, migratory students, children who are incarcerated , and other 20 underserved students . An SEA should translate relevan t materials and obtain the services of interpreters, as needed, to engage its English learners as well as famil ies and other sta keholders with limited English proficiency . A-12. How may an SEA use its ESSER SEA Reserve funds ? SEA Reserve fund s (includin g funds not allocated to LEAs or set aside for mandatory activities under the ARP Act ) may be used to address emergency needs resulting fro m the COVID -19 pandemic as determined by an SEA. The statute provides broad flexibility to the SEA in the use of its SEA Reserve funds . The SEA Reserve funds may be used by the SEA for any of the LEA ESSER allowable uses of funds and for other activities r elated to preventing, preparing for , and responding to COVID -19. An SEA might determine, for example, that SEA salari es and other supports are an emergency need in response to the COVID -19 pandemic that could be covered under the SEA Reserve. An SEA m ight also decide, based on its needs, to reserve less for administration in order to retain more SEA Reserve funds to addr ess emergency needs or, under ARP ESSER, to retain more for the required reservations for addressing the academic impact of lost instructio nal time, summer enrichment programs, and after -school programs. An SEA may make subgrants or enter into contracts with a wide range of entities, including LEAs and organizations serving students and families, from its SEA Reserve . An SEA may also use fu nds to provide technical assistance to LEAs around implementing evidence -based interventions to address the impact of lost instr uctional time. Support provided to LEAs or other entities under the SEA Reserve may be made on a competitive or formula basis . If an SEA awards funds to LEAs or other entities through subgrants, the SEA must carry out the requirements for a pass -through entity described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.331. If an SEA awards funds through a contract to an LEA or other entity, the SEA must follow the State's procurement process as required by 2 CFR \u00a7 200.317. GEER A-13. Which entities may receive emergency grants from a Governor through the GEER Fund? A Governor may provide subgrants to LEAs and IHEs within the State that have been \"most significa ntly impacted by coronavirus\" to support their ability to continue providing educational services to their students a nd to support the \"on -going functionality\" of these entities. In addition, a Governor may use GEER funds to provide support through a subgr ant or a contract to other LEAs, IHEs, and education - related entities that the Governor \"deems essential\" for carryin g out emergency educational services, providing childcare and early childhood education, providing social an d emotional support, and protec ting education -related jobs . An governmental, nonprofit , or for -profit entity within the State that provides services that support preschool, elementary, secondary, or higher education. For examples of such entities, see question A-4 in Frequently Asked Questions about the Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund (GEER Fund) available at : https://oese.ed.gov/files/2020/07/FAQs - GEER -Fund.pdf . A-14. Is a Gov ernor required to award GEER funds to each category of eligible entities (i.e., LEAs, IHEs, and education -related ent ities)? No. A Governor has wide discretion in determining the entities in the State that will receive GEER funds. A Governor may choose t o fund only LEAs, only IHEs, only education -related entities, or any combination of eligible entities. 21 A-15. How may an LEA us e GEER funds? Under section 18002(c) of the CARES Act and section 312(c) of the CRRSA Act, a Governor may determine whether to award GEER funds to LEAs , as well as identify specific uses of the funds within the broad parameters in the law . Beyon d any such restrictions imposed by a Governor, an LEA that receives GEER funds may use its award to support a broad range of activities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID -19 pandemic , including t hose activities allowed under ESSER . (See FAQ A-3.) An LEA may provide services directly or enter into an agreement (e.g., a contract or interagency agreement consistent with procuremen t requirements or otherwise legally authorized) for allowable activitie s under GEER. An LEA is not authorized to awar d subgrants with GEER funds. Other Provisions A-16. Do the requirements in the Uniform Guidance apply to ESSER and GEER Funds? Yes. T he requirements in the Uniform Guidance apply to expenditures of ESSER and GEER funds. Below are some important Uniform Guidance requirements to keep in mind. Cost Principles . Specific uses of ESSER or GEER funds must comply with the Cost Principles in subpart E of 2 CFR Part 200 of the Uniform Guidance . This requires, amo ng other things, tha t every grant expenditure be necessary and reasonable to carry out the performance of the award. (See 2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.403 -200.404 .) Consistent with requirements in the Cost Principles, all expenditures must be properly documented. (See 2 C FR \u00a7 200.403(g).) Pre-award Costs. The Uniform Guidance \u00a7 200.458 specifies that pre-award costs , i.e. those costs incurred prio r to the effective date of the Federal award or subaward , are only allowable with prior written approval . The Departm ent has authorized (i.e., provided prior written approval) that ESSER and GEER funds may be used for pre -award costs dating back to March 1 3, 2020, when the national emergency was declared. Time Distribution Records. The Uniform Guidance requirements relat ed to documenting personnel expenses at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.430(i) apply . Except as described in the paragraph below, this would mean t hat an LEA maintains the records it generally maintains for salaries and wages, including for employees in leave status, as long as payment s to employees in leave status are made consistent with grantee policies and procedures that apply to all employees, whether they are paid with Federal or other funds. (For more information on paying employees in leave status, s ee the Department Fact Sheet at : https: //www2.ed.gov/documents/coronavirus/factsheet -fiscal - questions.pdf .) An LEA must maintain time distribution records (sometimes ca lled \"time and effort\" reporting) only if an individual employee is splitting his or her time between activities that may be funded under E SSER or GEER and activities that are not allowable under the applicable program . However, it is likely there will be very few situations in which an employee of an LEA would perform multiple activities where some are not allowable under ESSER or GEER , and thus would be required to maintain time distribution records, given that an LEA is authorized to use funds on \"activi ties that are necessar y to maintain the operation of and continuity of services in [an LEA] and continuing to employ existing staff of the [LEA]\" in order to \"prevent, prepare for, and respond to\" the COVID -19 pandemic. Cash Management . ESSER and GEER gra ntees, in their role a s stewards of Federal funds, must comply with the requirements under the CMIA (implementing regulations at 31 CFR Part 205 ) and the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR Part 200) . In particular, the CMIA requires that a State \"limit th e amount of funds transferred to the minimum required to meet the State's actual and immediate cash needs.\" (See 31 CFR 205.11(b) .) In subgrantees, including LEAs, must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the State and dis bursement by the subgrantee. (See 2 CFR \u00a7 200.305(b) .) Construction . Approved construction projects must comply with applicable Uniform Guidance requirements, as well as the Department's regulations regarding construction at 34 CFR \u00a7 76.600 . As is the case with all remodeling or construction contracts using laborers and mechanics financed by Federal education funds, an LEA that uses E SSER or GEER funds for minor remodeling, renovation, repair, or construction contracts over $2,000 must meet all Davis -Bacon prevailing wage requirements and incl ude language in the contracts that all contractors or subcontractors must pay wages that are not less than those established for the locality of the project (prevailing wage rates). (See 20 U.S.C. 1232b Labor Standards.) (See also FAQ B-6.) Prior Approval . In additio n to pre -award costs discussed above, the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.407 requires prior written approval from either the Department or the State (Governor or SEA , as applicable) for certain costs , such as the purc hase of real property ; equipment and other capital expenditures ; entertainment costs; and travel costs . A-17. May ESSER and GEER funds be used in combination with ( \"braided with \") other funding? Yes. ESSER and GEER fund s may be used in combination with , but not blended with, funding under ESEA, IDEA, AEFLA , Perkins V, and McKinney -Vento , or any other education funds . Therefore , an SEA or LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to expand participation in an activity or service s it is currently conducting or plan s to conduct under these programs. \"Braiding \" funds occurs when different funding streams are used together to leverage the support provid ed for different needs for educators and students while maintaining documentation to support the charging and allocat ion of costs to multiple separate funding streams or programs. As specified in the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR \u00a7 200.405(d) , if a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the progr ams or activities based on the proportional benefit. Additionally, each funding stream mainta ins its identi ty and con tinues to be subject to the relevant statutory requirements, including eligibility criteria and scope of authorized activities. With the ex ception of consolidating administrative funds (see FAQ E -7) or consolidating funds in a schoo lwide program (see Suppo rting School Reform by Leveraging Federal Funds in a P rogram (September 2016) at: https://www2.ed.gov/po licy/elsec/leg/essa/essaswpguidance9192016.pdf ), ESSER an d GEER funds do not lose their individual identity when braided. A-18. Is there a \"supplement not supplant\" requirement for ESSER and GEER funds? No. The ARP Act, the CRRSA Act, and the CARES Act , however, include detailed provisions requiring States to maintain effort for elementary and secondary education and higher education . (See the Department's Guidance on Maintenance of Effort Requirements and Waiver Request .) Maintenance of effort provisions are designed to keep States f rom substantially reducing their suppor t for K -12 education and higher education. While these Acts do not address maintenance of effort requirements associa ted with other Federal funds, such as those for IDEA and ESEA , States and LEAs must be mindful that these requirements continue to apply. In addition, the ARP Act includes Maintenance of Equity requirements for both States and LEAs . More information on the Maintenance of Equity requirements, includ ing FAQs and Final Requirements, can be 23 found on the Department's Maintenance of Equity website : Do need to be obligated prior to obligating CRRSA Act and ARP Act funds ? No. All three funding streams are available now to meet the needs of students ; however grantee s should be mindful that each funding stre am has a different period of fund availability . (See FAQs E -1, E-2, and E-3.) A-20. Do the Buy American Act provisio ns apply to ESSER and GEER? The Buy American Act does not apply to the ESSER or GEER grants. However, awards made under the CRRSA Act and ARP Act (i.e., ESSER II, GEER II , and ARP ESSER awards) are subject to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.322 , a new regulation that applies to Federal grants mad e after November 12, 2020. It establishes domestic preferences for procurements under Federal grants t hat are subject to the Unifo rm Guidance. The text of the regulation follows: 2 CFR \u00a7 200.322 Domestic preferences for procurements. (a) As appropriate and to the extent consistent with law, the non -Federal entity should, to the greatest ex tent practicable under a Federal award, provide a preference for the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products , or materials produced in the United States (including but not limited to iron, aluminum, steel, cement, and other manufactured products). The requirements of this section must be included in all subawards including all contracts and purchase orders for w ork or products under this award. (b) For purposes of this section: (1) \"Produced in the United States \" means, for iron and steel products, that all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in th e United States. (2) \"Manufactured products \" means items and construction materials composed in whole or in part of nonferrous metals such as aluminum; plastics and polymer -based products such as polyvinyl chloride pipe; aggregates such as concrete; glass, including optical fiber; and lumber. A-21. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to improve cybersecurity? Yes. If a school, LEA , or State is improving cybersecurity to better meet educational and other needs of students related to preventing, preparing for, or responding to COVID -19, it may use ESSER or GEER funds. For example, if an LEA needs to increase its use of technology, su ch as for pot ential temporary shifts to hybrid learning if COVID -19 cases arise, expanded cybersecurity needs to facilitate that a ctivity may also be addressed using ESSER or GEER funds. 24 A-22. May an SEA or LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to develop or implem ent an innova tive approach to providing instruction to accelerate learning and mitigate the effects of lost instruction al time for those student s most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic ? Yes. An SEA or LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to develop or implem ent an innova tive approach to providing instruction to accelerate learning and mitigate the effects of lost instructional time for students most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. To the extent an innovative approach is evidence d-based, an LEA may use the ARP ESSER fu nds it reserves to implement the innovative approaches to address the impact of lost instructional time. As described in FAQ A -10, one of the tiers of evidence included in the definition of \"evidence -based\" refers to an approach that \"demonstrates a ration ale based on high -quality research findings or positive evaluation that such activity, strategy, or intervention is l ikely to improve student outcomes or other relevant outcomes\"; and includes \"ongoing efforts to e xamine the effects of such activity, strat egy, or intervention.\" This could include emerging technology -based or technology -enabled approaches, including educa tional technology platforms, that meet this definition. A-23. Which disposition rules must State s and LEAs follow for equipment and suppli es purchased with ESSER and GEER funds? (New December 7, 2022 ) What follows is key information for States and LEAs regarding the disp osition of supplies and equipment purchased with ESSER or GEER funds. Definition of Equipment : Under 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.1 , equipment is defined as tangible personal property (including information technology system s) having a useful life of more than one year and a per -unit acquisition cost that equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the n on-Federal entity for financial statement purposes or $5,000. Definition of Supplies : Under 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.1 , supp lies is defined as all tangible personal property that is not equipment. A computing device is a supply if the acquisition cost is less than the lesser of the capitalization level established by the non -Federal entity for financial statement purposes or $5 ,000, regardless of the length of its useful life. Continued Use of Equipment or Supplies beyo nd the Period of Performanc e: Equipment and supplies purchased with ESSER or GEER funds may be used by States or LEAs for the authorized purposes of the ESSER or GEER program, respectively, during the period of performance (i.e., through September 30, 2022 for ESSER I and GEER I; th rough September 30, 2023, for ESSER II and GEER II; or September 30, 2024, for ARP ESSER) or until the equipment and supplies are no l onger needed for the purposes of the ESSER or GEER 200.3 14(a) ). If the equipment or supplies are no longer needed for purposes of the ESSER or GEER program, a State or LEA ma y, in preferential order, continue to use the equipment and supplies to the extent they are n eeded for allowable purposes under another Federal education program in which the State or LEA participates, such as a program under the Elementary and Secondary E ducation Act of 1965 or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The State or LEA may then use the equipment or su pplies for a Federal program of another Federal awarding agency. (See 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.313(c) and 200.314(a)). Disposition of Equipment that Is No Longer Needed by a State : For States that used ESSER or GEER funds to purchase equipment and find that the item is not needed for authorized purposes under ESSER or GEER or for any of the State's other Federal pr ograms, a State must dispose of the equipment in 25 accordance with State laws and procedures. (2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.313(b) ). Disposition of Equipment that Is No Longer Needed by an LEA : LEAs that use d ESSER or GEER funds to purchase equipment and find that the item is not needed for authorized purposes under ESSER or GEER or for any of the LEA's other Federal programs, and where the equipment has a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or less, may be retained, sold, or otherwise dispos ed of without additional responsibility to the Department. If an item of equipment has a current per unit fair market value in excess of $5,000, the LEA may retain or sell the equipment. In this case, the Departme nt is entitled to an amount calculated by m ultiplying the current fair market value or proceeds from the sale by the Department's share or proportion of the cost of the original purchase. ( 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.313(e) ). Disposition of Supplies that Are No Longer Needed by a State or by an L EA: Supplies that cost less than $5,000 per unit vest in the State or LEA upon acquisition. If there is a residual invento ry of supplies that are not needed and the unneeded supplies exceed $5,000 in total aggregate value, the State or LEA may retain or se ll the supplies but, in either case, must compensate the Department for its share. The amount of compensation must be comp uted in the manner required for equipment under 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.313(e)(2) . The aggregate value of unneeded supplie s is their fair market value at the time of disposition. Given that disposition may occur at different times (for example, some suppli es may be needed longer than others, a State or LEA may calculate the total aggregate value when disposition occurs \u2014e.g., at the end of each year for which supplies are disposed. A State or LEA must make a good faith effort to sell unneeded supplies purch ased with ESSER or GEER funds in accordance with 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.314(a) and document its efforts. If a State or LE A cannot find a buyer and cannot use the supplies itself, the State or LEA has no further obligation to the Department. Using ESSER and GEER Administrative Funds to Support Disposition Costs : ESSER or GEER funds reserved by a State or LEA for administrati ve activities may support costs associated with the disposition of supplies and equipment (e.g., storage units to house ES SER or GEER equipment and supplies that are unneeded) during the program period. However, ESSER and GEER administrative funds are not available beyond the period of performance as noted above. As a result, there are no ESSER or GEER funds available to pay for disposition costs after the period of performance ends. A-24. May an LEA or another subrecipient award subgrants with ESSER and G EER funds? (New December 7, 2022 ) No. There is no authority in the CARES, CRRSA, or ARP Acts for a subrecipient to award subgrants with their ESSER or GEER funds. Only the SEA (for ESSER) or the Governor (for GEER) is authorized to award subgrants. Given the unique struct ure of the GEER Fund and varying internal State fiscal processes, those administering the GEER program sh ould contact the State's dedicated Department mailbox [State.oese@ed.gov] with any questions regarding subrecipient awards with GEER funds within the S tate. LEAs or other subrecipients may enter into contracts for services (see FAQ A -3). 26 B. Reopenin g Schools Safely and Promoting the Health and Safety of Students, Staff, and the School Community B-1. What resources are available to support the safe reopening and sustained operations of schools? ESSER and GEER funds may be used to develop strategies and implement public health protocols including, to the greatest extent practicable, policies in line with guidance from the CDC for the reopening and operation of school facilities to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other staff . CDC's operational strategy can be found at : https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/schools -childcare/operation -strategy.html . Volume 1 of the Department 's COVID -19 Handbook on sch ool reopening can be found at : https://www 2.ed.gov/documents/coronavirus/reopening.pdf .13 Volume 2 of the Department's COVID -19 Handbook on school reopening and meeting all student s' needs can be found at: https://www2.ed.gov/documents/coronavirus/reopening -2.pdf . In addition, the Federal Emergency Managemen t Agency (FEMA) is offering reimbursement for work conducted to safely open and operate Public Assistance -eligible facilities under the COVID -19 emerge ncy and major disaster declarations from January 21, 2021, to September 30, 2021. Eligible work includes: face coverings and personal protective equipment (PPE ); cleaning and disinfection; COVID -19 diagnostic testing, screening and temperature scanning; an d signage for social distancing. More information about FEMA's Safe Opening and Operation policy can be f ound here. FEMA has also developed a COVID -19 Education Resource Roadmap , and other topic al resource roadmaps, to help school systems address c hallenges and identify funding solutions for delivering educational services during the COVID -19 pandemic. The resource r oadmap s can be accessed at: https://www.fema.gov/media -collection/resource -roadmaps and LEAs may also use ESSER and GEER funds, consistent with Federal civil rights laws, for a range of evidence -based strategies that increase public safety for young people. More information about using Federal resources on strategies to reduce violence and enhance public safety to the benefit of their students, families, and communities, as part of their efforts to recover from the pandemic can be found here: 21-0130 -ARP -Public -Safety -ED-FAQ -06-16-2021.pdf B-2. Is COVID -19 tes ting for students and LEA staff an allowable use of ESSER and GEER funds? Yes. Because ESSER and GEER f unds may be used for public health protocols including, to the greatest extent practicable, policies in line with guidance from the CDC for the reopenin g and operation of school facilities to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educator s, and other staff , providing 13As more information becomes available, both the CDC and the Department will be updating documents. Therefore, SEA, LEA, and school officials are encouraged to periodically visit the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/schools -childcare/index.html and the Department's website at: https://www.ed.gov/coronavirus/doc uments to check for new and revised resources that can assist in safely reopening schools. 27 COVID -19 testing is an allowable use of ESSER and GEER funds. See Appendix B, Sections 1 and 2 for more information on COV ID testing. SEAs and LEAs should consult with State and local health officials to ensure the adequacy of any SEA or LEA COVID -19 testing program and that testing procedures comply with all applicable laws and requirements including those related to privac y, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Protection of Pupil Rig hts amendme nt (PPRA) , and the confidentiality of information requirements under Part B and Part C of the IDEA . Please note that t he Department of Health and Hum an Services separately provid ed $10 billion under the ARP Act to States as Epidemiology and La boratory Ca pacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases ( ELC ) Reopening Schools awards to support the implementation of COVID -19 testing programs , as recom mended by the CDC , in K-12 schools . This funding was deployed quickly through State health departments in order to help LEAs safely r eopen schools in the remaining months of school year 2020 -2021, during summer activities , and in the subsequent school year . State and local health departments will provide te chnical assistance to LEAs and schools in establishing COVID -19 testing programs. More information on the program can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dpei/pdf/ guidance -elc-reopening -schools -508.pdf . B-3. May funds be used to provide COVID -19 vaccinations to LEA teachers , staff , and eligible students ? Yes. Because ESSER and GEER funds may be used to implement public health protocols including, to the greatest extent practicable, policies in line with guidance from the CDC for the reopening and operation of school facilities to effectively maintain the health and safety of stu dents, educators, and other staff, providing COVID -19 vaccin ations is an allowable use of ESSER and GEER funds. Allowable vaccination outreach efforts in general could includ e activities to create awareness and build confidence, facilitat e clinics, and provide incentives such as paid time off for staff to get vaccinated . In cases where administrative fees are required to obtain a vaccination, ESSER or GE ER funds may be used to offset the cost as long as the cost is reasonable. See Appendix B, Section 1 for more information on vaccinations. B-4. May ESSER and GEER funds be used for personal protective equipment (PPE ), cleaning and sanitizing materials, an d related supplies necessary to maintain school operations during and after the COVID -19 pandemic? Yes. Purchasing PPE, cleaning and sanitizing materials, portable air purifiers, and emergency supplies necessary to adequately respond to COVID -19 are allow able use s of ESSER and GEER funds. These costs are consistent with the statutory purposes of the programs \"to prevent, prepare for, and respond to\" COVID -19, and LEAs are specifically authorize d to use funds for such activities . B-5. How might an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to engage stakeholders to build confidence in an LEA's plan for safe return to in -person instruction and continuity of service s? Section 2001(i) of the ARP Act requires an LEA that receive s ARP ESSER funds to develop, within 30 days of receiving the funds, a plan for the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services. Prior to issuing the plan, the LEA must seek public input and take those comments into consideration in developing the plan. (See FAQ A-4.) 28 An LEA ma y use ESSER and GEER funds to engage the public on the development of the safe return to in-person instru ction plan and for conducting active and sustained engagement with the school community. This includes using funds to cover the costs of conducting ong oing outreach, paying for translating and interpreting services as needed to ensure effective communicati on with individuals with limited English proficiency , providing reasonable accommodations such as interpreters and written materials in alternate forma ts for individuals with disabilities upon request, holding public meetings (including virtually), and con ducting surveys of families, students, educators, and other staff to better understand their perceptions, needs, and concerns. As schools and distric ts work to develop and implement strategies to safely reopen schools , engagement with educators, facility staff, families, and the school community is key. A successful school reopening strategy requires engaging the entire school community (specifically i ncluding underserved students and families and parents of students with disabilities or local special edu cation advisory committees ) to promote confidence and demonstrate inclusivity and identify any barriers to participating in in -person or hybrid instruc tion, in addition to broadly engaging education stakeh olders to support actions that will lead to a safe learning environment for all educators, staff, and students. As the CDC operational strate gy notes, \"the absence of in -person educational opt ions may disadvantage children from low -resourced communities, which may include large representation of racial and ethnic minority groups, English lea rners, and students with disabilities. Plans for safe delivery of in -person instruction in K -12 schools m ust consider efforts to promote fair access to healthy educational environments for students and staff. Thus, essential elements of school reopening pl ans should take into account the communities and group s that have been disproportionately affected by COV ID-19 infections and severe outcomes.\" For additional considerations, see the Supporting Ongoing Engagement with Educators, Families, and the School C ommunity section in the ED COVID -19 Handbook Volume 1: Strategies for Safely Reopening Elementary and Secondary Schools. As noted in FAQ A-4, an LEA is also required to develop a p lan for use of ARP ESSER funds that is distinct from the plan for the safe return to in -person instructio n and continuity of services. Under the Interim Final Requirements of April 22, 2021 , an LEA must, in developing its plan for use of ARP ESSER funds, engage in meaningful consultation as described in FAQ A-4 above. An LEA may use its ARP ESSER funds for that required stakeholder engagement for the plan for the use of ARP ESSER funds as well as the stakeholder engagement and consultation for the LEA's plan for the safe return to in - person instruction and con tinuity of services . An LEA should translate relevant materials and obtain the services of interpreters, as needed, to engage its English learners an d families with limited English proficiency (which may be done using ESSER funds) . B-6. M ay ESSER and GEER funds be used for construction ? (Updated December 7, 2022 ) Construction is authorized under Title VII of the ESEA (Impact Aid) and therefore is an a llowable use of GEER and ESSER funds under sections 18002(c)( 3) and 18003(d)(1) of the CARES Act, sections 312(c)(3) and 313 (d)(1) of the CRRSA Act, and section 2001(e) (2) of the ARP Act. The broad Impact 29 Aid definition of \"construction\" includes new const ruction as well as remodeling, alterations, renovations, and repairs under which many activities related to COVID -19 would l ikely fall.14 However, the Department strong ly discourages LEAs from using ESSER or GEER funds for new construction because this use of funds may limit an LEA's ability to support other essential needs or initiatives. Extensive remodeling, renovation, and new construction are often time -consuming, w hich may not be workable under the shorter timelines associated with ESSER and GEER fund s. These types of activities are also subject to a number of additional Federal requirements, as detailed below. While construction is generally allowable, it is the re sponsibility of a Governor, SEA, LEA, or other subgrantee to assure that individual cost s: 1) Comply with the Cost Principles in subpart E (e.g., the cost must be \"necessary and reasonable\" (2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.403-200.404 )); 2) Meet the overall purpose of the CARES, CRRSA, or ARP Act programs , whi ch is \"to prevent, prepare for, and respond to\" COVID -19; and 3) Are consistent with the proper and efficient administration of those programs. Under the se general principles, construction activities, including renovations or remodeling, that are necessary for an LEA to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID -19 coul d be permissible, though the burden remains on grantees and subgrantees to maintain the appropriate documentation that supports the expenditure. As noted above, an LEA using ESSER or GEER fu nds for remodeling, renovation, and new construction must comply with additional Federal requirements. For example, these projects require prior written approval by an LEA's SEA or Governor (or the Department for State projects). (See Title VII of the ESEA and 2 CFR \u00a7 200.439(b) .) Approved constr uction projects (i.e., remodeling, renovation, and new construction) also must comply with applicable U niform Guidance requirements, Davis -Bacon prevailing wage require ments,15 and all of the Department's applicable regulations regarding construction at 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 76.600 and 75.600 -75.618 . Some of the relevant part 75 requirements that must be considered before a new c onstruction project is initiated include16: 1) Has the grantee considere d the probable effects of proposed construction on any district, site, building, or stru cture that is included or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places ( 34 CFR \u00a7 75.602 )? See question B -6.d. for more in formation on the National Historic Preservation Act. 2) Does the grantee have title or other interest in the site, including right of access, that is sufficient to ensure that the grantee will have use and possession of the facility for 50 years or the useful life of the facility, whichever is longer ( 34 CFR \u00a7 75. 603)? 14 The Impact Aid program statute defines \"construction\" as \"(A) the preparation of drawings and specifications for school facilities; (B) erecting, building, acquiring, altering, remodeling, repairing, or extending school facilities; (C) inspecting and supe rvising the construction of scho ol facilities; and (D) debt service for such activities.\" ESEA section 7013(3), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 7713(3). 15 As is the case with all construction contracts using laborers and mechanics financed by Federal education funds, an LEA that uses ESSER or GEER funds fo r minor remodeling, renovation, repair, or construction contracts over $2,000 must meet a ll Davis -Bacon prevailing wage requirements and incl ude language in the contracts tha t all contractors or subcontractors must pay wages that are not less than those establish ed for the locality of the project (prevailing wage rates). (See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232b Labor Standards.) 16 The National Environmental Policy Act does not apply to ESSER an d GEER construction projects. The previous version of this FAQ errantly noted that an env ironmental impact assessment is required. See FAQ B -6c. for more information. 30 3) Can the grantee begin the approved construction in a reasonable time period and h ave the final plans been approved before the construction is advertised or placed on the market for bidding ( 34 CFR \u00a7 75.605 )? 4) Can a grantee compl ete the project in a reasonable time period and consistent with the approved plans and sp ecifications ( 34 CFR \u00a7 75.606 )? 5) Is the construction fu nctional, economical, and not elaborate in design or extravagant in the use of materials as compared to other facilities in the State or other applicable geographic are a (34 CFR \u00a7 75.607 )? 6) Do the grantee's plans and designs for the facilities comply with applicable Federal, State, and local health and safety s tandards, as well as Federal requirements regarding access by persons with disabilities (34 CFR \u00a7\u00a775.609 and 75.610 )? 7) Does the grantee have sufficient operational funds to operate and maintain the facility once the construction is complete and will the grantee operate and maintain the facility in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local requirements ( 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 75.614 and 75.615 )? 8) Has the grantee filed a notice of Federal interest that must be executed on property when ESS ER or GEER funds are used to purchase land, construct a building, or make impro vements to a building on leased property (OMB Standard Form 424D)? An SEA or Governor may use other State agencies (such as Public Works or similar offices) to assist with approvals and management of ongoing projects. However, ultimately as the grantee, an SEA or Governor is responsible for ensuring that its LEA grantees are meeting all app licable requirements that are detailed in 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 75.600 -75.618, as well as in OMB Stand ard Forms 424B and D (Assurances for Non - Construction and Construction Programs , https: //apply07.grants.gov/apply/forms/sample/SF424D - V1.1.pdf ), including the standards; hazards; historic preservation; health and safet y; energy conservation; and coastal barrier resources. (See FAQ A -17 for additional Uniform Guidance information.) Finally, if ESSER or GEER funds are used for construction, g rantees and subgrantees should also be aware that real property and equipment a cquired or improved under a Federal award must be appropriately insured, and grantees mu st consult with the Department on disposition instructions in the event that the property or equipment is no longer needed. See, e.g., 2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.310 -200.313 . B-6.a. May a State determine the process for granting prior approval to an LEA to use ESSER or GEER funds for capital expenditures ? (New December 7, 2022 ) Yes. As noted in FAQ B -6, capital expenditures projects require prior written approval by an LEA's SEA or Governor (or the Department for St ate projects). (2 CFR \u00a7 200.439(b) .) Neither the Department nor the Uniform Guidance specifies an SEA process fo r granting prior approval to an LEA to use ESSER funds for capital expenditures such as minor remodeling or construction (including HVAC projects). Therefore, an SEA ha s the flexibility to establish its own reasonable and expeditious proce ss that ensures expenditures meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, including those in subpart E of the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR part 200). For example, an SEA could: Use or modify existing prior approval procedures from other Federal prog rams; Consider using a building expert (e.g., engineer, inspector, architect) who knows applicable Federal, State, and local requirements to assist with its review of prior approval req uests. The expert could be acquired on a limited basis through procurem ent or an agreement with another State agency with authority over facilities; 31 Develop a checklist of items that an LEA seeking prior approval should provide, which could include: o How th e need for the repair, construction, or modernization prevents, prepare s for, or responds to the COVID -19 pandemic; o The name of the school facility the LEA is proposing to repair, construct, or modernize; o Identification of the LEA's interest in, or authori ty over, the school facility involved, such as an ownership interest or a lease arrangement; o Sources and amounts of funds available for the proposed project; o A statement signed by an appropriate, independent local official affirming that: The renovation or construction project meets applicable Federal, State, and local requir ements with respect to health and safety, environmental standards, Historic Preservation, and other requirements (see FAQ B -6 and 34 CFR part 75 ); and The renovation or construction is necessary (e.g., any deficiency associated with the renovation or construction threatens the health and safety of facility occupants or prevents the use of the facility). An appropria te local official may include a local building inspector, a licensed archite ct, or a licensed structural engineer. o A cost estimate and other details needed to support the reasonableness and allowability of the expenditure under the applicable statute (e.g. , ARP Act) and cost principles in the Uniform Guidance (e.g., the origi nal c onstruction date and the dates and descriptions of any other major renovations of the facility); and o Applicable assurances and certifications (see FAQ B -6 for applicable requiremen ts that must be met for any renovation or construction project). Under applicable Department requirements, State prior approval is recommended, but not required, before LEA bidding is advertised. State approval may come at any point in the project timelin e until the point that reimbursement using ESSER or GEER funds occurs. Ideal ly, the State review process is complete as soon as possible on a project's timeline, but a State may utilize this flexibility at any point in the project process. B-6.b. What in formation does the Department need in order to consider a State's prior appr oval request for a State's capital expenditures? (New December 7, 2022 ) As noted above, a State (SEA or Governor) as the pass -through agency is responsible for granting prior approval to subgrante es for capital expenditures. However, if a State is us ing ESSER or GEER fund s it reserves at the State level for a capital expenditure, the State, under the Uniform Guidance, must seek prior approval from the Department for its expenditures. In general, fo r State projects, a State's prior approval request sho uld include detailed i nformation on the project or capital equipment purchase; how the project or purchase will prevent, prepare for, or respond to COVID -19; a timeline for the project; and a budget. A State must obtain prior approval of the final working drawings and specifica tions from the Department before a construction project is advertised or placed on the market for bidding ( 34 CFR \u00a7 75.605 ). State prior approval requests sho uld be submitted to the Department via the State's dedicated Department mailbox [State.oese@ed.gov]. 32 B-6.c. Is a grantee/subgrantee required to complete an environmental impact as sessment under 34 CFR \u00a7 75.601 and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for a construction, renovation, or real property project suppor ted by ESSER or GEER funds? (New December 7, 2022 ) No. The Department does not exercise control over the use of the funds for any individual project as long as the project continues to meet all statutory and other applicable requirements (such as the Uniform Guidance and the Department's administrative reg ulations). As a result, construction, renovation, or real property projects supported by ESSER or GEER grants are not considered a \"major Federal action\" under NEPA and are not subject to 34 C FR \u00a7 75.601 . While NEPA environmental impact assessments are not applicable, the Department strongly encourages grantees to require some type of environmental assessment for projects tha t involve breaking new ground, such as projects to expand the size of an existing building or replace an outdated building. This may already be required by State law and would help to assess any potential environmental ramifications of expanding or replaci ng school facilities and ensuring compliance with local or other environmental requirements. B-6.d. What are grantee and subgrantee responsibilities under the requirements in section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act? (New Dec ember 7, 2022 ) Section 106 of the National Historic P reservation Ac t of 1966 (NHPA) requires Federal agencies to consider the effects on historic properties of projects they carry out, assist, fund, permit, license, or approve. If a Federal or federally -assisted project has the potential to affect historic p roperties, a section 106 review will take place. Section 106 gives the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation, interested parties, and the public the chance to weigh in on these matters before a final decision is made. Consistent wi th those requirement s, ESSER and G EER grantees and subgrantees are expected to assess the probable effects of any proposed construction on any district, site, building, or structure that is included or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of His toric Places. Gran tees will consult with the Department for State projects. Consistent with 34 CFR \u00a7 76.60 0(b) and (c) , a State is authori zed t o perform the Department's functions for its subgrantees when complying with certain section 106 requirements. This authorization applies to section 106 historic property reviews with respect to projects that are funded in whole or in p art with ESSER or GE ER funds. The State may consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) to initiate the section 106 review process, identify and evaluate historic properties, and assess effe cts. The Depart ment remains responsible for participating in the consultation process when: The State determines that \"Criteria of Adverse Effect\" apply to an undertaking; There is a disagreement between the State and the SHPO/THPO regarding identificati on and evaluati on, a nd/or assessment of effects; There is an objection from consulting parties or the public regarding findings, determinations, the implementation of agreed upon provisions, or either the consulting parties or the public's involvement in a section 106 r eview ; or There is the potential for a foreclosure situation or anticipatory demolition as specified in section 110(k) of the NHPA. 33 B-6.e. What are the Federal reporting requirements associated with using ESSER and GEER funds to purchase l and, construct a bui lding, or make improvements to a building? (New December 7, 2022 ) There are three sets of reporting requirements for States and LEAs that use ESSER or GEER funds to purchase land, construct a building, or make improvements to a building. The first is t o record the Fe deral interest in the title of real property and include a covenant in the title of real property acquired in whole or in part with Federal assistance funds to assure nondiscrimination during the useful life of the project. In addition, as p art of the gran t award assurances for ESSER I, ESSER II, and ARP ESSER, and GEER I and GEER II, the chief state school officer for ESSER and the Governor for GEER assured that the SEA would comply with OMB Standard Forms 424B and D (Assurances for Non -Cons truction and Construction Programs). OMB Standard Form 424D states, among other things, that the grantee: Will not dispose of, modify the use of, or change the terms of the real property title, or other interest in the site and facilities without permissi on and instruct ions from the awarding agency. Will record the Federal interest in the title of real property in accordance with awarding agency directives and will include a covenant in the title of real property acquired in whole or in part with Federal assistance fund s to assure nondiscrimination during the useful life of the project. The second reporting requirements are those in the Uniform Guidance that are triggered when Federal funds are used to acquire or improve real property. For example, see, 2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.310 -200.313 , which provide more detail on consulting with the Department when the property is modifie d or disposed of, including the conditions under which the Federal government must b e compensated when property is sold. Finally, annually States must report to the Department and LEAs must report to the State/SEA (pass -through agency) on the status of the real property for at least the first 15 years see, e.g., 2 CFR \u00a7200.330 . B-7. May ESSER and GEER funds be used for renovation, including for such projects as making improvements to a school fac ility to improve indoor air quality (such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems), and projects that would promote social distancing and safe in -person instruction? (Updated December 7 , 2022 ) Yes. ESSER and GEER funds may be used to make necessary im provements, for example to improve air quality and support social distancing, so that teachers and students may safely continue in -person instruction. As is th e case with al l activities charged to ESSER or GEER, costs must be reasonable and necessary to me et the overall purpose of the program, which is \"to prevent, prepare for, and respond to\" COVID -19. (See 2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.403 -200.40 4.) Therefore , renovation or remodeling activities that are necessary for an LEA to prevent, prepare for, or respond to COVID -19 would be permissible. This might include re novations that would permit an LEA to clean effectively (e.g., replacing old carpet with tile tha t could be cleaned more easily) or create a learning environment that could better sustain social distancing (e.g., bringing an unused wing of a school into co mpliance with fire and safety codes in order to reopen it to create more space for students to ma intain appropriate social distancing). This might also include, for example, as noted in section 2001(e)(2)(O) -(P) of the ARP Act: School facility repairs and improvements to enable schools to reduce the risk of virus transmission and exposure to environm ental health hazards, and to support student health needs. Inspection, testing, maintenance, repair, replacement, and upgrade projects to improve the indoor air quality in s chool facilities, including mechanical and non -mechanical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, filtering, purification and other air cleaning, fans, control systems, and window and door repair and replacement. Please see the Department's July 2021 guide to 34 Improving Ventilation in Scho ols, Colleges, and Universities to Prevent COVID -19 for additional guidance. As noted in FAQ B -6, these projects are also subjec t to prior wri tten approval by a Governor or SEA (or the Department for State projects) and appl icable Uniform Guidance requirements, Davis -Bacon prevailing wage requirements, and any of the Department's applicable regulations regarding construction at 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 76.600 and 75.600 -75.618 . or GEER activity, a grantee or subgrantee must follow all applicable Federal, State, and local standards and policies (e.g., building codes or s pecifications for HVAC systems), which may be consistent with standards identified by the Enviro nmental Protection Agency (EPA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or World Health Organization. If an LEA uses funds for HVAC systems, under 34 CFR \u00a7 75.616(c) , the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standards apply. Please note that, for the purpos e of HVAC projects supported by Department COVID relief funds, the Department has indicated that projects should meet the current ASHRAE standards, as noted above in the improving ventilation factsheet (issue d July 2021). A State, SEA, or LEA might also consider using ESSER or GEER funds to establish a program for assessing and improving HVAC systems. Such a program could also require verification that prope r ventilation is oc curring, such as through the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) monitors. Some HVAC upgrades may constitute \"minor remodeling\" and the Department's applicable regulations regarding construction at 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 75.600 -75.618 ling\" means minor a lterations in a previously completed building. The term also includes the extension of utility lines, such as water and electricity, from points beyond the confines of the space in which the minor remodeling is undertaken but within the confines of the pre viously comple ted building. The term does not include permanent building construction, structural alterations to buildings, building maintenance, or repairs. Minor remodeling projects that constitute capital assets under the Uniform Guid ance still require prior approval consistent with 2 200.439 . See FAQs B -6.a, B -6.b for more information on prior approval. The EPA has a variety of publications that can assist education leaders in improving the indoor air quality in schools. EPA resources on indoor air quality in schools can be accessed at: https://www.epa.g ov/iaq - schools . The EPA -cleaners -hvac filters -and-coronavirus -covid -19 on indoor a ir filtration devices that use bipolar ionization technology, which has the potential to create ozone. EPA states that ozone generators should not be used in occupied spaces. If choosing to use a device that incorporates bipolar ionizati on technology, EPA recommends usi ng a device that meets UL 2998 standard certification (Environmental Claim Validation Procedure (ECVP) for Zero Ozone Emissions from Air Cleaners) and notes that there are many air cleaning devices that do not use bipolar i onization. EPA's Clean Air in Buildings Challenge includes a set of guiding principles and best p ractices to as sist building owners and operators with reducing risks from airborne viruses and other contaminants indoors. In addition, the CDC provides information on improving ventilation in schools at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - and GEER funds to purchase trailers or modular units? Yes. Under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.33, \"equipment\" means \"tangible personal property (includ ing information technology sy stems) having a useful life of more than one year and a per -unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the non -Federal entity for financial statement purposes, or $5,000. \" Generally, a trailer or mod ular unit meet s this definition. Accordingly, an LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to purchase trailers or modular units if such purchases are 35 necessary to create additional safe learning sp aces due to the COVID -19 pandemic (e.g., for more effective social distancing con sistent with CDC guidance) (see section 2001(e)(2)(Q) of the ARP Act). In addition, the use of grant funds to purchase equipment is subject to 2 CFR \u00a7 200.439(b) , which requires the LEA to obtain prior written approval from the Governor or SEA. As with all costs, they must be reasonable and necessary. In the case of such large purchases, it may be benefic ial for the LEA to do a cost a nalysis under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.318(d) comparing the cost of buying trailers and modular units with th e cost of leasing, for example. When select ing which students will receive services in trailers or modular units, an LEA should ensure that decisions are made consistent with applicable civil rights requirements and that certain subgroups are not disproportionately educated in trailer s or modular u nits, especially if being educated in the trailers or modular units limits access to other students, activities, or services within the school or in any way contributes to tracking or within -school segreg ation. B-9. May an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to renovate, remodel, or construct athletic facilities, such as swimming pools, playing fields, or sports stadiums? (New December 7, 2022 ) This would not be an allowable use of funds unless there is a connection between the expenditure and preventing, preparing for, or resp onding to COVID -19, considering the specific facts and circumstances of a project . Expenditures of ESSER or GEER funds must meet the overall purpose of the CARES, CRRSA, or ARP Act programs. In addition, the Department discou rages LEAs from using these fun ds for new construction, as this use of funds limits an LEA's ability to meet other, more pressing needs related to the pandemic's impact on learning and the emotional and mental health and well -being of our children and yout h. It is the responsibility of the grantee and subgrantee to ensure that, among other Federal requirements, any project is targeted to the overall purpose of the ESSER or GEER program, which is \"to prevent, prepare for, and r espond to\" COVID -19. It is uncl ear, for example, how construct ing a swimming pool is related to the pandemic or otherwise allowable under the CARES, CRRSA, or ARP Act. B-10. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to mitigate flood, tornado, and other natural disaster -related damage, includi ng damage to buildings/infrastr ucture, technology, and equipment, to ensure that schools can open and safely remain open? (New December 7, 2022 ) Yes, in limited circumstances, if such use is consistent with the primary purpose of ESSER and GEER funds to assist States and LEAs in preventing, preparing for, and responding to COVID -19. However, the SEAs and LEAs may want to take advantage of any available funding, including through FEMA's Public Assistance program or the Department's Project SE RV. Many, if n ot all, costs incurred following a natural disas ter may be covered by insurance or with funding received through FEMA's Public Assistance program. To the extent there are activities that are necessary to meet students' needs in response to th e pandemic, in cluding needs exacerbated by a recent natural di saster, ESSER or GEER funds may be used to cover the costs consistent with the ESSER or GEER allowability considerations (i.e., allowable under the statute and consistent with the Uniform Guidan ce). For examp le, ARP ESSER specifically provides that an LEA may use ESSER funds for \"school facility repairs and improvements to reduce risk of virus transmission and exposure to environmental health hazards, and to support student health needs\" (section 2001(e)(2)(O) of the ARP Act). To the extent that a natural d isaster has caused damage to school infrastructure and buildings that would increase the risk of virus transmission or impact in -person learning, such as flood or fire damage, then ESSER or GEER funds may be used to cover the costs of activities to reduce that risk. It is important for an LEA to maintain documentation and written 36 justification as to how uses of ESSER or GEER funds are related to the COVID -19 response, particularly where costs are closely assoc iated with damage from a natural disaster. B-11. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to support costs for utilities or gasoline? (New December 7, 2022 ) Generally, ESSER or GEER funds may be used to support activities that are necessary to maintain the operation and continuity of services in the LEA as schools and studen ts recover from the pandemic . For example, there may be instances where the use of funds to support this type of cost would be acceptable, such as in a case where an LEA has incurred additio nal expenses for utilities due to efforts related to improving in door air quality. The costs must be reasonable and otherwise consistent with the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.403 -200.405). B-12. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to pay student fees for activities such as art, music, and theater classes? (New December 7, 2022 ) Yes, under certain circumstances. Because ESSER or GEER funds may be used to support activities addressin g the unique needs of students from low -income backgrounds, students with disabilities, English learners, students of color, students experiencing homelessness, and child ren and youth in foster care, and help students recover from the pandemic an LEA may u se ESSER or GEER funds to pay fees, including outstanding balances, to help ensure equitable access to programs that meet students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs. Alternatively, an LEA could use ESSER or GEER funds to support such ac tivities for all students, such that no fee is charged. B-13. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to provide students with safe, healthy, and supportive learning environmen ts? (New December 7, 2022 ) The primary purpose of ESSER and GEER funds is to assist States and LEAs in preventing, preparing for, and responding to the COVID -19 pandemic. To the extent there are safety and supportive measures and activities that are necessary to meet stud ents' health and well -being and other needs in response to the pandemic, ESSER or GEER funds may be used to cover the costs consistent with allowable uses of ESSER and GEER funds under the statutes and consistent with the Uniform Guidance, as noted earlier in these FAQs. As with all uses of funds, the grantee is responsible for ensuring tha t the use of funds supports the overall purpose of the CARES, CRRSA, or ARP Act programs , which is \"to prevent, prepare for, and respond to\" COVID -19. In all cases, th e Department strongly recommends that States and LEAs focus on evidence -based practice s that promote safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments. A comprehensive approach should include efforts specific to: Implementing Multi -Tiered S ystems of Sup port (e.g., Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports), and other early intervent ion strategies. Providing integrated behavioral and mental health supports to educators and staff (e.g., hiring certified mental health professionals and beh avior special ists). Working collaboratively with a diverse multidisciplinary team trained in youth development to create emergency plans and training exercises. Increasing professional development opportunities for faculty, staff, and community partners, particularly a round trauma -informed care and culturally and linguistically inclusive responses. 37 Ensu ring that prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery activities consider the evidence base and are implemented in ways that respond to unders erved students, protect students' rights, and demonstrate respect for students' dignity and potenti al. In supporting efforts to address the mental health needs of students, we suggest States and LEAs review the effective strategies that the Department has identified in our guidance on Supporting Child and Student Social, Emotional, Behavioral, and Mental Health Needs , in Strategies for Using American Rescue Plan Funding to Address the Impact of Lost Instructional Time , in Volume 2 of the ED COVID - 19 Handbook , or on the fact sheet regarding Supporting the Mental Health Needs o f All Students with American Rescue Plan Funds . B-14. May ESSER and GEER funds be used for the cost of purchasing and installing video systems for security purposes? (New December 7, 2022 ) There may be limite d circ umstances where purchasing and installing such a system, consistent with applicable law, is permissible, since ESSER or GEER funds may be used by an LEA for the purpose of promoting safe and secure schools. As with all uses of funds, the grantee is r espons ible for ensuring that the use of funds supports the overall purpose of the CARES, CRRSA, or ARP Act programs , which is to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID -19. To the extent that video systems capture student and staff behavior, whether intentionally or incidentally, there may be additional requirements and considerations as discussed below. Privacy Considerations . LEA officials are regularly asked to balance the interests of safety and privacy for students, consistent with applicable la w. For example, while the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR part 99 ) generally prohibits educational agencies and institutions from disclosi ng personally identifiable information from a student's education records absent written consent from parents or elig ible students (age 18 or older or attending a postsecondary institution at any age), there are exceptions to the general consent requiremen t that can help schools and LEAs to take steps to maintain school safety. Images of students captured on video system s that are maintained by a school official may or may not be considered \"education records\" subject to FERPA. For more information, see \"FAQs on Photos and Videos under FERPA\" at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/faqs - photos -and-videos -under -ferpa . Images of students captured on video systems that are main tained by the school's law enforcement unit are generally not considered \"education records\" under FERPA, and, theref ore, may not be subject to FERPA's requirements. For more information, see \"School Resource Officers, School Law Enforcement Units, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\" at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/SRO_FAQs.pdf . The use of video systems may raise other privacy concerns. Accordingly, the LEA should consider several questions before deciding to use video systems, including where the cameras are located, who has access to the images, how the images will be used, and how long th e images will be retained. As a best practice, LEAs should only collect, use, and retain the minimum amount of persona lly identifiable information that is relevant and necessary to accomplish an authorized purpose. LEA officials should consult with their l egal counsel to determine whether any Federal or State laws may be applicable. Further, consideration needs to be gi ven to the places in which individuals would enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy to avoid violating such expectations. Applicable St ate law should be considered because the use of video systems may give rise to legal obligations regarding access to a nd disclosure of any recordings, as well as their retention and disposition. These issues should be considered in advance of developing a policy on the use of video systems. For example, it would be helpful to consider whether 38 images of individuals can be blurred or redacted before providing access to or disclosing any recordings to protect the privacy of those individuals. Civil Rights Co nsiderations. Federal civil rights laws enforced by the Department's Office for Civil Rights require an LEA that recei ves Federal financial assistance not to discriminate based on race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender i dentity), disability, and age in their programs and activities.17 An LEA's nondiscrimination obligations apply to the c onduct of school staff and other persons with whom the school has a contractual or other arrangement, including security staff, private s ecurity, and school law enforcement officers. The LEA has a responsibility not to discriminate when conducting surveill ance and other security or safety activities using video systems. Specifically, an LEA must ensure nondiscrimination in decisions to obt ain and use such equipment, including where to place such devices to ensure such surveillance does not treat students u nnecessarily differently on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability or age or have an unjustified discriminatory impac t on these bases; and must ensure the videos and related information are not used in a discriminatory manner. Additio nal Policy Considerations. If an LEA chooses to use a video system, it should have a clearly established policy on the use of video systems on school property. As a best practice, the LEA should develop the policy surrounding the use of video systems in co nsultation with students, their families, and school -based staff, so that uses of the video systems are widely understood and privac y concer ns are more fully considered in the development of the policy. The policy should effectively address privacy and ci vil liberties issues and provide fair notice to students and their families, staff, and visitors that on -campus video systems are in place. At a minimum, the policy should: (a) describe the purposes for which video systems are used on school property (b) a ddress the placement of the cameras to ensure that cameras are not placed in any areas where there is a reasonable expectation of pr ivacy; ( c) notify staff and students through staff and student/parent handbooks and signage (in accessible formats) that on -campus video systems may be present on school property and on vehicles used for school -provided transportation, along with the purp oses of the surveillance equipment, as set forth above; and (d) state whether the video recordings may become a part of a st udent's education record or a staff member's personnel record and under what conditions, the process for disputing the inclusion of such rec ordings as part of any record, and, if applicable, how it is maintained consistent with local, State, and Federal la ws such as FERPA. The LEA must comply with all applicable laws related to record maintenance and retention. The LEA policy should also incl ude reasonable procedures intended to preserve data related to a known incident that involves injury to students, st aff, or members of the public or damage to property, or that involves any potential violation of the law or LEA policies, pr ocedures, or rul es of conduct. Depending on relevant facts, the use of video systems in classrooms may raise concerns regarding the potential application of other Federal or State laws. LEA officials should consult with their counsel to determine whether a ny such laws are applicable. 17These Federal laws include: Title VI of the Civil Right s Act of 1964, which prohibits di scrimination based on race, color, or national origin; Title IX of the Education Amendmen ts of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disab ilities Act of 1990, which prohib it disability discrimination (the U.S. Department of Education shares responsibility with the U.S. Department of Justice for enforcing Title II, which applies to public entities, regardless of whether they receive Federal f inancial assistance); and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits age discrimination. Applicable State laws ma y prohibit discrimination in additional areas. 39 C. Advancing Educational Equity in COVID -19 Response Overall Equity Considerations C-1. What should each State and LEA consider in order to ensure that ESSER and GEER funds are equitably allocate d among schools? SEAs and LEAs should estab lish practices that ensure all students are provided resources that establish equitable opportunities to learn . Reso urce equity means that schools serving larger proportions of historically unde rserved groups of students \u2014including students from low -income families , students of color, English l earners, students with disabilities , and students experiencing homelessness \u2014require more funding , depending upon the needs of the students at a particular school . In addition, resource allocat ion decisions should recog nize that certain student populations and school communities have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and ensure resource equity , including through allocating funding to provide more intensive social, emotional, mental health , and academic services as needed on return to in -person learning. Because ESSER funds are distributed to LEAs in proportion to the a mount each LEA received under part A of title I of the ESEA in the most recent fiscal year , ESSER is already targeted to LEAs with concentra tions of students from low -income families. Although an LEA may use ESSER funds for any school under the supervision of the LEA, ESSER funds may also be targeted on those schools that are eligible for or participate in part A of title I. ESSER funds can be further focused by the LEA to advance educational equity by only serving those schools operating schoolwide program s. (To qualify for a Title I schoolwide program, at least 40 percent of the students enrolled must come from low-income families , unless a s chool receives a waiver from the SEA under section 1114(a) (1)(B) of the ESEA .) Under GEER , consistent with section 18002(c)(1) of the CARES Act and section 312(c)(1) of the CRRSA Act, a Governor may provide emergency suppor t to LEAs that the SEA determin es have been \"most significantly impacted \" by the COVID -19 pandemic . The SEA has substantial flexibility in making this determination and might consider, among other things: The percentage of families in the LEA with incomes below the poverty line; The pe rcentage of students in an LEA that represent underserved populations (e .g., students with disabilities, English lea rners, students experiencing homelessness , children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated ); The projec ted number of days that the LEA was unable to provide in-person instruct ional services as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic ; Unemployment data for the geographic area in which the LEA is located; and The extent to which the LEA is located in a geographic a rea in which a significant number or percentage of individuals have tested positive for or been significantly affect ed by the COVID -19 pandemic . When determining how to allocate GEER funds within an LEA, an LEA might also balance similar considerations in order to effectively target GEER funds to advance educational equity . 40 C-2. How may an LEA use ESSER and GEER fun ds to support students who have lost instructional time due to the COVID -19 pandemic ? SEAs and LEAs must reserve a portion of their ARP ESS ER funds to address the academic impact of lost instructional time. Specifically, section 2001(f)(1) of the ARP Act requires an SEA to reserve not less than 5 percent of the State's grant to carry out, directly or through subgrants or contracts, activities to address the academic impact of lost instructional time by supporting the implementation of evidence - based interv entions. Similarly, section 2001 (e)(1) of the ARP Act requires each LEA to reserve not less than 20 percent of its ARP ESSER allocation to a ddress the academic impact of lost instr uctional time . Please note that these reserves are only minimum requirements ; spending a larger share of funds for this purpose is allowable and may be necessary to address the needs of students . The interventions implemented through these reservations m ust be evidence -based (see FAQ A-10) and may include such activities as summ er learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive after-school programs, tutoring , extended school year programs , and innovative approaches to providing instruction to accelerate learning . Further, SEAs and LEAs must ensure that the interventio ns implemented respond to students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs and address the disproportionate impact of the COVI D-19 pandemic on students from low -incom e families, students of color, children with disabilities, English learners, migratory students, students experiencing homelessness, and children and youth in foster care. ESSER and GEER funds may also be used to pr ovide a variety of activities and suppor ts to help improve the achievement of students to address the impact of lost instructional time due to the COVID -19 pandemic . For example, f unds may be used for costs associated with evidence -based approaches to acceleratin g learning , high-dose tutoring , leveraging technology to provide embedded assessment and differentiated instr uction, diagnostic and curriculum -embedded assessments , and extend ing the school day or year to provide additional time for student learning , enrichment, and support. These costs may include supplementing the salaries of educators and other qualified perso nnel to perform additional services . ESSE R and GEER funds may also be used to support the costs associated with hiring a dditional teachers and teacher aides to provid e intensive support to students . ESSER and GEER f unds may further be used to provide profe ssional development to educators on research -based strategies for meeting students' academic, social, emotional, mental health , and college , career , and future readiness needs, including strategies to accelerate learning without remediation or tracking . For more information on using ESSER and GEER funds to address the academic impact of lost instructional time for students with disabilities eligible under IDEA , see FAQ C-5. Effective strategies to address lost instructional time are further described in V olume 2 of the Department 's COVID -19 and GEER funds to suppo rt student s' social, emotional, mental health , and academic needs , including by hiring support personnel such as nurses, counselors , and soc ial workers ? An LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds , including the 20 percent of ARP ESSER funds set aside to address the academic impact of l ost instructional time , to support students ' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs , including by implementing school -wide strategies that enhance supports and interventions for students as well as targeted assistance for student s who need such supports . For example, an LEA mi ght hire additional personnel to prioritize student well -being and health by increasing 41 student access to teachers, nurses, counselors, social workers , and other support personnel (including teache rs' aides and paraprofessionals) . An LEA might also address the needs of students arising from the COVID -19 pandemic by using ESSER and GEER funds to implement or expand arts programs, such as music program s, including purchasing instruments; expand sports programming so more students can participate; or initiate clubs, such as a robotic or STEM club. LEAs should also work to ensure that schools are implementing instructional practices that are culturally responsive and that incorporate trauma -informed pe dagogy in response to the COVID -19 pandemic . For example, LEAs with high con centrations of English learners may hire additional bilingual st aff to address the social, emotional, mental health , and academic needs of English learners. ESSER and GEER funds may be used to support implemention of curriculum, including related professional development. As noted in FAQs A-4 and A -9, in implementing evidence -based strategies to address the academic impact of lost instructional time through the ARP ESSER required r eservation of funds , SEAs and LEAs must respond to students ' social, emotional , mental health , and academic needs and address the disproport ionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on students from low -income families, students of color, English learners, ch ildren with disabilities, migratory students, students experiencing homelessness, and children and youth in foster care . Effective strategi es to support student social, emotional, mental health , and academic development are further described in Volume 2 o f the Department's COVID -19 Handbook on S tudent Groups Most Impacted by the Pandemic Please note t hat the following FAQs provide examples of allowable uses of ESSER and GEER funds for specific groups of students. To the extent that these groups are also served by other Federal education programs, uses of funds under those programs , which are governed b y specific program matic requirements , may be more restrictive . The examples provided below with respect to one student group may also be im plemented with respect to other student groups if the LEA determines it is necessary and reasonable to do so. C-4. How may an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to support English learners (also referred to as multilingual learners) ? In order to address the n eeds of English learners , an LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to address the impact of lost instructional time and se rvices, support culturally responsive instruction, and support family engagement activities. To address the impact of lost instructional ti me, an LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds for a variety of activities , including : Extended -day and/or extended -year ac tivities designed to recover lost instructional time as a result of the pandemic, including costs associated with trans portation services to support English learners ' access to these services. Providing language accommodations for English learners to incre ase their access to content, and/or their participation in programs and services. Activities that respond to the social and emotional learni ng needs of English learners , including professional development for teachers to support English learners \u2014e.g., how to provide a welcoming, nurturing , and supportive learning environment whatever the learning mode; and strategies that increase student coll aboration and enhance classroom community. 42 Hire additional bilingual staff (including certified bilingual education teachers) to address the social, emotional, mental health , and academic needs of English learners . To address and promote culturally respo nsive practices that leverage the assets of English learners and provide the essential scaffolds and supports, an LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to provide professional development for staff (including administrator s, teachers, counselors , and other stud ent services staff) that is focused on meeting the unique needs of English learners . For example, an LEA may use ESS ER and GEER funds to provide professional learning: For content teachers on implementation of strateg ies to provide meaningful access to the content, to promote English language development , and to offer language accommodations during instruction in a vari ety of modes; For all teachers on formative assessment strategies to monitor the progress of English learners in content and language instru ction; For counselors and student service staff on asset -based scheduling practices that support meaningful access t o core content classes ; For administrators and teachers on vertical articulation and collaboration p ractices to support the successful tran sition of English learners in critical stages such as grades K -1, 5-6, and 8-9; Technology specifically focused on h elping E nglish learners access remote instruction or other tools that will help them better access the curriculum and provide enrichment; an d PPE that helps facilitate language instruction (i.e. , transparent masks). To address and promote family engagemen t and dual capacity building for staff and families of English learners , an LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to provide: Outreach to familie s of E nglish learners during the COVID -19 pandemic that includes them as partners in education. For example, an LEA might provid e support to help parents navigate online platforms, track student p rogress, and seek help/resources when needed. This may also include using ESSER and GEER funds for translation and interpretation services. The Department's Fact Sheet : Pro viding Services to English Learners During the COVID -19 Outbr eak is a helpful tool that outlines States' responsibilities to E nglish learners and their parents. Translation serv ices to assist with communication around the COVID -19 pandemic , for example related to effective prevention and mitigation strategies, test screening, remote learning, and opportunities to address lost instructional time. C-4.a. In addition to the approac hes described in FAQ C -4, how may ESSER and GEER funds support multi lingual learners? (New December 7, 2022 ) SEAs and LEAs may use ESSER or GEER funds to support social, emotional, and academic needs of multilingual learners or immigrant children or youth in response to a nd recovery from the COVID -19 pandemic. In addition, funds may be us ed to address long -standing inequities that have been e xacerbated by the pandemic, Funds may be expended for a wide range of activities including: Supporting the development or expansion o f multilingual instructional programs, including programs that provi de instruction in Native American languages. Supportin g an increase in available learning and enrichment time, such as through extended day, week, or year programs, or additional out -of-school time (e.g., during school breaks). Supporting services to meet increased needs of immigrant children or youth includi ng by providing a whole child approach. Assessing individual student needs and tailoring supports to unique circumstances. Providin g professional development to educators and others who provide addit ional supports, such as tutors, to ensure instruction a nd enrichment are evidence -based and culturally and 43 linguistically responsive, including by ensuring students learn listening, speaki ng, reading, and writing skills in an integrated manner in all langu ages they are studying. Supporting collaboration betwee n teachers and others providing additional instruction to integrate multilingual learners' experiences or to ensure continuity of ins truction between the regular school day and any additional out -of-school learning time. Recruiting, preparing, and developi ng multilingual educators and staff, including through pathway programs such as high -quality residencies, grow your own programs, and registered apprenticeships. Providing teacher candidates with addi tional financial support such as stipends, loan forgive ness, and service scholarship programs. Supporting existing educators and staff in adding bilingual or other specialized certificati ons that support multilingual learners, including by covering the co sts associated with earning those additional certificat ions. Supporting or expanding programs that offer a seal of biliteracy to recognize students who demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages.18 Supporting the development or expansion of digital lit eracy programs for multilingual students, families, and caregivers. C-4.b. In addition to the approaches described in FAQ C -4 and C -4.a., how may ESSER and GEER funds support family engage ment for multilingual learners? (New December 7, 2022 ) In addition to the approaches described in FAQ C -4 and C -4.a, ESSER or GEER funds may support family engagement for multilingual learners or immigrant children or youth as part of the effort to address the impact of l ost instructional time and to address the unique needs of multilingual learners arising from the pandemic. Such investments may help families of multilingual learners become more fully aware of the range of programs, courses of study, and supports that can help their students overcome obstacles created and exacer bated by the pandemic and succeed in academic co ursework. For example, ESSER or GEER funds may be used to expand outreach and community engagement with local organizations that serve multilingual le arners and to expand an LEA's multilingual social media an d online presence to ensure families have accura te, up -to-date information about learning opportunities. As described in FAQ C-4, ESSER or GEER funds may also be used to provide translation and inte rpretation services. In establishing or expanding such pr ograms, SEAs, LEAs, and schools should engage co mmunities to support needs assessment, program design and development, and implementation, all of which may be allowable uses of ESSER and GEER funds. ESSER or GEER funds may also be used to assist families i n understanding their students' linguistic devel opment in each language and how they can support multilingual learning at home. C-4.c. How may ESSER and GEER funds support assessments for multiling ual learners? (New December 7, 2022 ) ESSER or GEER funds may be used to de velop, improve, and administer assessments for English learners, including formative, diagnostic, interim, and summative assessments as part of a school's and 18 To further align with statewide biliteracy efforts, an SEA may amend its consolidated State plan under the ESEA to modify its School Quality or Student Success indicators under its statewide accountability a nd improvement system, consistent with the requirements under ESEA section 1111(c)(4)(B)(v), to include a new measure in its methodolo gy that rewards schools for succe ssful programs, such as a measure based on students earning a seal of multiliteracy. 44 LEA's efforts to quantify and address t he impact of lost instructional time that resulted from th e pandemic. This may include de veloping assessments in a language and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable information on what students know and can do, consistent with ESEA section 1111 and 34 CFR \u00a7 200.6 ,19 and may also include developing and administering assessments in a Native American language.20 ESSER or GEER funds may support development of assessm ents for multilingual learners or = immigrant children or youth that include projects, portfolios, and extended performance tasks that measure a full range of higher -order thinking skills and that are culturally and linguistically responsive in their desig n and implementation.21 ESSER or GEER funds may also be used to ensure families understand the results of any assessments, such as by ensuring score reports and other information are available in an a ccessible language and format consistent with 34 CFR \u00a7 200.8 . C-5. How may an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to support the needs of children with disabilities under the IDEA ? As described in FAQs A-3 and A-15, ESSER and GEER funds may be used for any activity authorized by the IDEA .22 LEAs should consider what services are needed to meet the needs of children with disabilities , including children w ith disabilities who are English learners . In an Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) question and answe r document issued on September 28, 2020, OSEP reiterated the Department's long -standing position that under Part B of the IDEA, no matter what primary instructional delivery approach is chosen, SEAs, LEAs, and individualized education program (IE P) 19 To meet its requirement to administer annual statewide summative assessments, a State must assess, using assessments written in English, the achievement of an English le arner in meeting the State's reading/language arts academic standards if the student has attended schools in the United States, excluding Puerto Rico and, if applicable, students in Native American language schools or progr ams consistent with 34 CFR \u00a7 200.6(j) , for three or more consecutive years, except that an LEA ma y determine, on a case -by-case bas is, to assess a student in a language other than English for a period that does not excee d two additional years if doing so would likely yield more accurate and reliable information. Nevertheless, an SEA or LEA may also as sess students in other languages a nd may assess students in other content areas in languages other than English, as appropr iate. An SEA, LEA, or school may use formative and interim assessments in any appropriate language and may use ESSER or GEER funds to develop them. 20 Where Native Amer ican language assessments are used to meet the annual statewide summative assessment requirements, they must be completed in a manner consistent with 34 CFR \u00a7 200.6(j) . 21 The statewide su mmative assessments required by ESEA section 1111(b)(2)(B)(vi) may be partially delivered in the form of portfolios, projects, or extended performance tasks. There are no ESEA requirements related to any additional formative, diagnostic, o r interim assessm ents an LEA or SEA may elect to administer that are not used to meet the requirements to administer a statewide summative assessment. 22 IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 et seq., consists of three parts: IDEA Part B includes requirements for formula grants to assist States in making available a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment to eligible children with disabilities in mandatory age ranges. Ent itlement to a free appropriate public education ( FAPE) begins at a child 's third birthday and could last until the 22nd birthday, depending on State law or practice. IDEA Part B consists of the Grants to States Program authorized by IDEA section 611(f) for children with disabilities aged three through 21 and the Preschool Gran ts Program author ized by IDEA section 619(g) for children with disabilities aged three through five. IDEA Part C consists of the Grants for Infants and Families Program authorized by I DEA section 643(c) for making formula grants to assist States in providi ng early interven tion services to infants and toddlers from birth through age two and their families (and at the State's option beyond age three until the school year following the chi ld's third, fourth, or fifth birthday). IDEA Part D sections 650 through 682 includes pro visions for making discretionary grants to support State personnel development, technical assistance and dissemination, technology, and parent -training and information centers. 45 Teams remain responsible fo r ensuring that a free appropriate public education (FAPE)23 is provided to all children with disabilities. Regardless of whether an SEA has provided explicit guidance on using ESSER or GEER funds, SEAs and LEAs may use these f unds to provide ad ditional instruction and services to children with disabilities , often referred to as compensatory services ,24 to address lost instructional time . A child's IEP Team would be require d to make an individualized determination whether and to what extent compe nsatory services may be needed, consistent with applicable requirements, including to make up for any skills that may have been lost . See OSEP's questions and answer s document issued on March 12, 2020 . Similarly, States may use ESSER and GEER funds to make available early intervention services to those who were not provided such services consistent with a child's individualized family services plan (IFSP) as a result of disruptions in services due to the COVID -19 pandemic .25 In add ition to the services outlined throughout this document, ESSER and GEER funds may be used for the following purposes consistent with the IDEA for children with disabil ities. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list. Services to support strugg ling learners under section 613(f) of IDEA Part B : Provid ing comprehensive coordinated early intervening services (CEIS) for children not currently identified as needing special education or related services, but who need additional academic and behavioral su pport to succeed in a general education environment , including: o Professional development (which may be provided by entities other than LEAs) for teachers and other sch ool staff to enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic and behaviora l interventions, including scientifically based literacy instruction, and, where appropriate, instruction on the use of adaptive and instructional software; and o Provi ding educational and behavioral evaluations, services, and supports, including scientific ally based literacy instruction. Services to support children with disabilities age 3 -21 under section 611 of IDEA Part B : Providing support and direct services for children with disabilities, including technical assistance, personnel preparatio n, and pr ofessional development and training; Implementing child find policies and procedures , including ensuring identification, location, and evaluation of children who may n eed special education and related services including underserved groups , such as children experiencing homeless ness, migrat ory children , and highly mobile children ; Eliminating evaluation backlogs ;26 Addressing the loss of instructional time and loss of ski lls for children with disabilities , and determining on an individual basis , in accordance with applicable requirements , by the IEP Team 23 FAPE is defined in 34 CFR \u00a7 300.17 as special education and related services that: (a) are provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge; (b) meet the standards of the SEA, including the requirements of IDEA Part B; (c) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, o r secondary schoo l education in the State involved; and (d) are provided in conformity with an IEP that meets the requirements of 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 300.320 through 300.324. See also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(9). 24 Some States refer to these services as \"recovery services\" due to the COVID -19 pandemic, although IDEA does not use this term. 25 State lead agencies other than SEAs may also use ESSER and GEER funds through an interagency agreement or other wr itten method with the SEA or Governor's office. 26 Activities may include contracting with additional evaluators to address backlogs, or the implementation of valid assessment or evaluation tools and instruments that can be administered reliably using a vir tual platform, if necessary. 46 whether compensatory services may be needed for a child with a disabil ity who was unable to receive FAPE as a result of school closures or other disruptions in services due to the COVID -19 pandemic ; Providing extended -school -year services as determined on an individual basis by a child 's IEP Team to be necessary to provide FAPE to the student ; Monitoring, enforcement, compl aint investigation s, and the mediation process, including providing for the costs of medi ators and support personnel; Providing positive behavioral interventions and supports and mental health services for children with disabilities; Improving the use of technology in the cl assroom and/or in a remote setting for children with disabilities to enhance learning ; Supporting the use of technology, including technology with universal design principles and assistive technology devices, to maximize accessibility to the general educa tion curriculum for children with disabilities; Implementing transiti on programs, including coordination of services with agencies involved in supporting the transition of children with disabilities to postsecondary activities; Assistin g LEAs in meeting pe rsonnel shortages including by hiring additional personnel to provide special education and related services and reducing caseloads in key areas; Supporting capacity -building activities and improving the delivery of services by LEAs to improve results for children with disabilities; Developing programming for children with disabilities who have been expelled from school, children with disabilities in correctional facilities, children enrolled in State -operated or State - supported schools, and children with d isabilities in charter schools; and Increasing the number of high -need children with disabilities funded under a State's high -cost fund. Services to support preschooler s with disabilities age d 3 through 5 under section 619 of IDEA Part B: In addition to the activities listed above, as appropriate, ESSER and GEER funds may be used in: Implementing child find policies and procedures, including ensuring identification, location, and evaluation of children who may need special education and r elated services including underserved groups, such as children experiencing homeles sness, addressing evaluation backlogs resulting from school closures, including eligibility determinations for children transitioning from the State's IDEA Part C prog ram; Assisting LEAs in personnel shortages by hiring additional early childhood special education and related services providers ; Assisting LEAs in meeting personnel training needs for preschool staff ; Costs related to safely providing FAPE across a varie ty of preschool settings ; Providing developmentally appropriate positive behavioral inte rventions and supports and mental health services for preschoolers with disabilities; and Implementing transition activities , including coordination with the Part C pr ogram on the transition of children exiting Part C, and planning of services with schools for preschoolers entering kindergarten . 47 Services under IDEA Part C : Providing early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities and their famili es; Supporting IDEA Part C personnel including service coordinators through technical ass istance, personnel preparation, use of alternative delivery methods, and professional development and training; Implementing the State's child find system with a speci fic emphasis on addressing related issues of equity for historically underserved populati ons through outreach and coordination with child find partners , referral sources, and other Federal programs for infants and toddlers and expand ing referr al sources through training and education. To make available early intervention services to those infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families that were not provided such services consistent with a child's IFSP as a result of public agency closures and/or other disruptions in services as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic . Addressing any 45 -day timeline backlogs including the child and family assessment and evaluation of the child to determine eligibility; Improving the use of technology to deli ver IDEA Part C services and improve use of tele - intervention by early intervention service (EIS) prov iders; Providing developmentally appropriate positive behavioral interventions and supports and mental health services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and t heir families; Implementing early childhood transition, including coordinating with the P art B preschool program and the SEA; Assistin g EIS providers and programs in meeting personnel training needs and provider shortages through hiring addition EIS and re lated service providers ; Monitoring and enforcing IDEA requirements, and conducting disp ute resolution (including complaint investiga tions and conducting mediations); and Conducting outreach to parents and families of infants and toddlers with disabilitie s. Services under IDEA Part D : States may choose to contract with existing IDEA Part D grantees to provide additional services, consistent with the scope of work funded under the specific grant program, to support children with disabilities. Examples inc lude, but are not limited to, pro viding additional funding for: State -specific services provided by the State's Parent Training and Information Center or Community Parent Resource Center; State -specific professional development services provided by the St ate's State Personnel Development Grant , if applicable ; State -specific services provided by Part D technical assistance center grantees such as the Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, the National Center on Intensive Intervention, the National Deaf Center, etc .; Personnel preparation programs focused on increasing the num ber of qualified special education teachers, related services providers, and faculty; and Additional State -specific services provided by Part D technology centers to e nhance access to instruction . 48 C-6. How may an LEA use ES SER and GEER funds to support students with disabilities who are not IDEA -eligible but who receive services in accordance with a Section 504 plan? Under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) , a recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education prog ram must provide FAPE to all qualified students with disabilities in the recipient's jurisdiction, regardless of the severity of the student's disability. See 34 CFR \u00a7 \u00a7 104.33 - 104.36. An appropriate e ducation under Section 504 includes the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that are designed to meet the individual educational needs of students with disabilities as adequately as the n eeds of nondisabled students are met and are based on adherence to requirements governing least restrictive setting, evaluation and placement, and procedural safeguard s. Specialized instruction and services necessary to ensure FAPE under Section 504 must b e provided at no cost to parents. ESSER and GEER funds may be used for the provision of r equired educational and related aids and services determined necessary to ensure the provision of FAPE to students with disabilities who are not eligible under IDEA bu t receive services in accordance with a Section 504 plan. In addition , ESSER and GEER fun ds may be used to provide additional instruction and services to students with Section 504 plans who are not IDEA -eligible , often referred to as compensatory services , to make up for any skills that might have been lost if it is individually determined in accordance with respective applicable standards that the student was unable to receive FAPE as a result of the closure of school building s or other disruption in servi ces as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic . C-7. How may ESSER and GEER funds be used to support students experiencing homelessness? ESSER and GEER funds may be used for services and interventions specifically tailored to meet the needs of students experie ncing homelessness27 including, for example : Outreach and service delivery ; Mental healt h services and positive behavioral interventions and supports ; and Planning and implementing summer learning and after -school programs addressing the needs of students experiencing homelessness. An LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to ensure that all stude nts experiencing homelessness are identified and full y participate in school on the same basis as their peers through, for example, outreach, training, and community c ollaborations. For example, an LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds for the following purpose s: To increase the FTE hours of the homeless liaison designated under McKinney -Vento; To assign building -level contacts (particularly in highly impacted schools); To increase specialized support staffing, such as counselors, social workers, and others wh o are specifically trained in outreach and ser vices for students experiencing homelessness ; and To provide transportation services to ensure access to after -school or summer learning and enrichment programs . 27 ESSER I, ESSER II, GEER I, and GEER II fu nds are specifica lly authorized to be used for activities authorized under McKinney -Vento. Although ARP ESSER funds are not specifically authorized for that purpose, they may be used f or any activity allowable under the Impact Aid program under Title VII o f the ESEA, which includes allowable activities under McKinney -Vento. 49 An LEA should coordinate the use of ESSER and G EER funds with other education funds used to s upport homeless students such as McKinney -Vento and part A of title I of the ESEA to ensure a comprehensive approach to meeting those students' needs . Please note that ESSER and GEER funds should be used to a ddress the specific needs of students experie ncing homelessness , just as they are intended to meet the needs of other underserved groups of students and other groups o f students most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. The ARP Act also includes an additiona l $800 million to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness, and these resources should be additive to the supports and services provided under ESSER and GEER. C-8. How may an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to serve children and youth in foste r care? The COVID -19 pandemic has caused unique challenges for students in foster care and their caregivers. For example, the pandemic has caused increased disruption s in students' living placements and, as a result, school plac ements; students often have inconsistent access to schoolwork and classes, as foster and kinship caregivers often have limited access to and knowledge about the technology needed for virtual instruction; and schools face challenges in providing the supplem ental education services re quired by students in foster care. ESSER and GEER funds may be used broadly to address the needs of students in foster care during the COVID -19 pandemic. As a result , LEAs have considerable flexibility in using ESSER and GEER f unds to address the unique needs of students in foster care. While specific uses of funds depend on the local context and the unique needs of students and caregivers, ESSER and GEER funds might be used to support the following activities: Transporting students in foster care to the ir respective schools of origin where LEAs are offering in-person learning, hybrid learning, or supplemental instruction/coaching opportunities; Purchasing technology (including laptops, Wi -Fi hotspots, or tablets ) that enable students in foster care to co nsistently access instruction; Providing academic support s\u2014including tutoring or supplemental instructional opportunities \u2014to meet the unique learning needs of students in foster care; Helping students and/or care givers meet their basic needs, including ac cess to meals and hygienic supplies (such as masks or hand sanitizer); and Meeting rising mental health and behavioral needs (for example, contracting with community mental health providers to support students vir tually and/or on -site at school). LEAs sho uld coordinate with State and local child welfare agencies to identify and streamline, where possible, the supports provided to students in foster care and their careg ivers. As always, intentional coordination bet ween educational agencies and child welfare agencies remains essential to supporting students in foster care and their caregivers during the COVID -19 pandemic. 50 C-9. How may an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to support migratory students? ESSER and GEER fun ds may be used to address needs of migrator y children by providing support such as: Supplemental instruction to address the academic impact of lost instructional time , provided through before - and after -schoo l programs, weekend programs , or summer programs; Facilities for students to access a rel iable internet connection needed for remote learning; Fees that might be required to access drop -in centers operated by community organizations; Transportation of mig ratory children to school or drop-in centers and other facilities where students may acce ss necessary technology and/or instructional support; Staff to assist migratory students in their homes during school hours with schoolwork and provide technology supp ort as needed; Staff to go t o housing sites to provide high school equivalency instructi on for migratory out -of- school youth; Provision of childcare and/or early childhood education programs for younger migratory children who would otherwise be cared for by older, school -age siblings during school hours due to their parent/guardian(s)'s emplo yment as an essential worker; Providing information and assistance , including interpreters and translated information, to parents and families on how they can effectiv ely support their migratory c hildren, including in a distance - learning environment; Ment al health services and other forms of social, emotional, and behavioral support for migratory children; Outreach and information for migratory families to help them ac cess COVID -19 testing and vaccines, including provision of transportation , interpreters, and translated information as needed; and Outreach activities to help ensure migratory children are enrolled in school, attend regularly, and are engaged in online lea rning. C-10. How may ESSE R and GEER funds support students who are in correctional facilities, including those who are served under the Title I, Part D programs for students who are neglected, delinquent, or at risk? The COVID -19 pandemic has presented u nique challenges in provid ing educational services in secure correctional facilities. ESSER and GEER funds may be used in a variety of ways to support these students, just as they may be used in regular school settings. For example, ESSER and GEER funds co uld be used to support dis tance learning through technology and broadband improvements, a nd professional development for educators on the effective use of technology . Funds could also support technology to allow youth to meet virtually with family and meet with personnel to address student s' academic, social, emotional, behavioral , and mental health needs due to the COVID -19 pandemic ; to improve on-site library resources ; and provide instructional supports that address lost instructional time, such as high- quality tutoring or leveraging technology for formative and diagnostic assessment and dif ferentiated instruction . Funds could be used for materials and services that support postsecondary education access and career development and job placement, whic h mig ht also have been impacted due to the COVID -19 pandemic . ESSER and GEER funds could also be used for materials and services that support adult and career and technical education in correctional facilities. This includes integrated education and training programs, career pathway initiatives, pre -apprenticeships, apprenticeships, postsecondary e ducation 51 access and career development and job placement, which all might have been impacted due to the COVID -19 pandemic . Interventions and Strategies for Considerat ion C-11. How may an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to address chronic abs enteeism? (Updated December 7, 2022 ) ESSER or GEER funds may be used to implement data -driven strategies to address chronic absenteeism that has increased as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Allowa ble uses include outreach to students and families; accelerating learnin g for students with significant amounts of lost instructional time during the COVID -19 pandemic; and other intensive social, emotional, mental health, and academic supports. ESSER or GEER funds may be used to support efforts to locate and reengage studen ts who are chronically absent and to work with students and families to address underlying needs or barriers that are causing chronic absenteeism as schools recover from the pandemic. This may include personal outreach by educators and support staff and pr oviding linguistically inclusive information at community sites and online. ESSER or GEER funds may support stipends or other additional compensation for teachers who spend time outsid e their regular working hours to locate and reengage students who are ch ronically absent. ESSER or GEER funds may further support students experiencing homelessness, such as by increasing support for liaisons who support the population. Similarly, ESSER or GEER funds may augment support for students from migratory families; fo r example, program staff who work with these students may need flexible work hours during the week, weekends, nights, and in the summer to canvas the community in search of agricultura l workers and to visit families in their homes. ESSER or GEER funds may also be used to match students with mentors and rapidly contact families to identify and overcome barriers to regular attendance. An LEA may not provide direct monetary rewards to stu dents or families for school attendance; however, ESSER or GEER funds ma y be used to develop and pay for recognition programs that encourage student attendance (e.g., rewarding strong or improved attendance through eligibility to participate in special events for a class) (see FAQ C -23.a). ESSER or GEER funds may be used to bu ild community partnerships with homeless shelters, local social service agencies, and local media and transit authorities, which can help students attend school regularly and dissemina te reminders about the importance of regular attendance. These and other approaches may be especially important in supporting students experiencing homelessness. For additional resources on addressing chronic absenteeism among students experiencing homeles sness, please see the National Center for Homeless Education's resources on the topic. Effective strategies to address chronic absenteeism and reengage students are further described in Volume 2 of th e Department's COVID GEER funds may also be used to address the impacts of chronic abse nteeism and to help leaders take action to reduce it. For example, ESSER or GEER funds may be used to provide additional social, emotional, mental health, and academic support during school breaks or before and after school. Actions to address chronic abse nteeism may include tiered practices such as: Foundational strategies th at support the entire school community and make schools welcoming learning environments; Practices to prevent absenteeism, such as predictable routines and clear communication; Actions that support students at greater risk of chronic absenteeism or who mee t the lower boundaries of the definition of chronically absent, such as individualized outreach and support or home visits; and 52 Case management and related supports for student s who h ave missed the most instruction. In addition, to guide LEA decision -making around which strategies to implement, ESSER and GEER funds may be used to develop data quality systems that will assist in: Establishing a common definition of what consti tutes a day of attendance across all modes of instruction, including in -person, remote, virtual synchronous, and asynchronous; Tracking daily attendance and determining whether absences occur during in -person, or, if used, remote learning (whether synchron ous or asynchronous) settings; Monitoring and publishing disaggregated data on the number of students who are absent 10 percent or more of the time; Conducting research and analyzing data to determine which attendance metrics are associated with lower acad emic pe rformance in distance or hybrid learning; and creating early warning systems based on key student indicators, including chronic absenteeism, credit accumulation, course grades, and discipline rates, to identify students at risk of dropping out of sc hool. ( For additional information, see FAQ C-11a.) C-11.a. How may ESSER and G EER funds be used to support early warning indicator systems? (New December 7, 2022 ) ESSER or GEER funds may be used to develop and implement early warning indicator (EWI) systems, which can track attendance, assignment or course completion and credit acc umulation, grades, and discipline rates. These data can be examined frequently (e.g., monthly) and used to inform targeted engagement strategies in response to these data . When viewed at the cl assroom and student level, these data can strengthen a school's ability to provide specific, timely interventions (including support for educators where needed), which is crucial to addressing the impa ct of lost instructional time due to the pandemic. States and LEAs may also collect data on the successful transitions of students from pre -school to elementary school, elementary school to middle school, middle school to high school, and high school to postsecondary education. For example, schools may use o n-track indicators to assess how well students transition into high school so that the schools may provide additional supports as needed. Using information from the EWI, schools may want to conside r implementing or enhancing multi -tiered systems of support that typically include: (1) school-wide supports ; (2) progress monitoring; (3) tiered systems of academic and social, emotional, and behavioral interventions ; and (4) evidence -based instructional and behavioral interventions. LEAs may also use ESSER or GEER funds to create well -designed student sur veys, which can be particularly helpful when used in advance of and during these transitions. Survey results can be incorporated into the EWI to provide important information to educators on how studen ts are feeling about these transitions and where additi onal support might be needed. Note that surveys must be utilized in compliance with the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) . Funds ca n also be used to provide professional development to educators on how to analyze and use the data to identify t he appropriate intervention and monitor its effectiveness. C-12. How may an SEA or LEA u se ESSER and GEER funds to improve its data systems and its transparency when reporting to the public ? It is important that parents, educators, and the public have ac curate and meaningful information about how students are learning during and after the pa ndemic and what learning opportunities are available . In 53 addition to their primary purposes of ensuring that schools can reopen safely and addressing students' social, emotional, mental health , and academic development, ESSER and GEER funds may be used for data collection and the creation of State- or LEA -level data dashboards that provide public reporting when the reporting is related to the COVID -19 pandemic (e.g., establishing new collections or dashboards that specifically address lost instruction al tim e)\u2014disaggregated to the greatest extent possible by race/ethnicity, economic status, English learner s tatus, disability status, h omelessness status, and other factors \u2014on critical measures including: School instructional offerings by modality (e.g., open f ull-time in -person for all students, remote option avai lable for all students) ; Student enrollment rates by school and by instructional modality (open for full -time in -person instruction, open for hybrid instruction, and fully remote learning) ; Student att endance rates by school and by instructional modality ; Chronic absenteeism rates by school and by instructional modality ; Rate of student participation logging into remote learning for students in fully remote or hybrid learning environments by school ; The average n umber of hours of live instruction by grade s pan (for students in full y remote or hybrid learning environments ) by school by month ; A measure of students and educators who have adequate technology (devices and high -speed internet access) for remo te instruction ; A measure of the distribution of school meals by school ; Reporting on impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on States' collection of data for the State Performance Plans and Annual Performance Report s as required by section 616 of the IDEA; Othe r opportunity -to-learn indicators such as disc ipline rates, access to advanced course work , teacher turnover and quality data ( e.g., experience , certification , access to professional learning ); access to counselors , social workers, psychologists, and nurses ; and Student learning across multiple measures , including assessments. SEAs and LEAs may also use administrative funds for this purpose. C-13. How may an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to support full-service community school s? An LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to provide services and supports to students and families through evidence -based, full -service community schools. The ARP Act defines a full -service community school as it is defined in section 4622 of the ESEA : a public elementary school or sec ondary school that (A) participates in a community -based effort to coordinate and integrate educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services through community -based organziations and public and private partnerships; and (B) prov ides access to such s ervices in school to students, fam ilies, and the community, such as access during the school year ( including before -and after -school hours and weekends), as well as during the summer. Evidence -based community school approaches include integrated student su pports, active family and communit y engagement, expanded learnin g time opportunities, and collaborative leadership and practices. Using ESSER or GEER funds to support full- service community schools can help support students' social, em otional, mental health , and academic development and ot her basic needs . Additional ly, LEAs may utilize funds in the development or expansion of in-school student support centers that provide mentoring, counseling , and social and emotional learning supports to students in individual or group sessions . 54 C-14. H ow may ESSER and GEER funds be used to support mental health services for students and educators facing COVID -19 pandemic -related trauma? (Updated December 7, 2022 ) Addressing the mental health needs of students is an important goal of the ARP ESSER progr am. ESSER or GEER funds may be used to provide mental health services and supports for students and their families, educators, and staff who have mental health needs related to or exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic. The Department recognizes the widespre ad impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on mental health, and the particularly extensive effects of COVID -19 on youth mental health (see, for example, the Surgeon General's Advisory on P rotecting Youth Mental Health -youth -mental -health -advisory.pdf and the CDC's th mental health threats at https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0331 -mental - health -covid -19.html ). ESSER or GEER funds may therefore support mental health services in three key areas : (1) improving access to high -quality mental health care; (2) improving communication and transparency about mental health supports with the wider school community; and (3) implementing and integrating evidence -based approaches to social, emotional, and m ental well -being. Specific strategie s within each of these three categories are discussed below: Improve Access to High -Quality Mental Health Care Create a positive, acc essible process for students, educators, and staff to seek help and support. This p rocess may include increasing mental h ealth resources and support on school campuses and awareness of those resources and services. Taking a whole -school approach to wellnes s can also create a more positive process for seeking support and services. Mental health literacy training for educators and staff can also be effective in helping them facilitate students obtaining mental health supports inside school buildings and in th e community. Use early intervention strategies . Early interventions conducted by me ntal health staff are associated with positive academic and developmental outc omes , including fewer disciplinary encounters, increased engagement, and elevated g raduation rates. Ensure there is suffi cient access to high -quality mental health staff (e.g., psychologists, counselors, social workers, and well -trained behavior specialist s) within school buildings. ESSER or GEER funds may be used to hire additional staf f, develop plans for leveraging multip le Federal and State funding streams to increase access to mental health staff, prioritize activities that build local capacity to sust ain services, and develop comprehensive evaluation plans for adjusting supports bas ed on data. ESSER or GEER funds may al so be used to establish processes and systems to bill Medicaid for health services, as eligible, including hiring or contracting with staff to do this work. Reduce negative attitudes and beliefs associated with seeking mental health support by providing mo re information on mental health challenges and supports available, investing in professional development of school staff, offering tele -mental health options, actively engaging students in health decisions, and activel y engaging the wider school community (e.g., holding regular meetings about resources and making practice changes based on community feedback). Provide students equitable ac cess to mental health services that are welcoming and inclusive with regard to race , ethnicity, culture, language, disabi lity, and for students who identify as LGBTQI+. This can include increasing the number of professionals who can provide services in languages in addition to English and the diversity of school counselors, mental health professionals, social workers, psycho logists, nurses, and other integrated support staff in a 55 manner consistent with applicable law, including the civil rights laws enforce d by the Department. ESSER or GEER funds may support efforts to increase diversity in school -based mental health services providers by offering loan forgiveness or service scholarships, creating career pathways (including beginning in high schools), and cr eating or strengthening LEA partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Unive rsities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). Improve Communication and Transparency about Mental Health Supports with the Wider School Community Use accessible language and ensure that all school mat erials and mental health personnel communicate in a language understood by multilingual families and students and accessible to persons with disabilities. Public schools are obligated to ensure meaningful communication with parents with limited English pro ficiency (LEP) in a language they can understand.28 Public schools must also ensure that communications with families and students with disabilities are as effective as comm unications with others. 29 Accessibility for a person with a disability also extends to a public school's web content, as d iscussed in the Department of Justice's recent guidance on web accessibility . Schools may use ESSER or GEER funds to meet or go beyond these legal obligati ons to ensure all students and familie s are able to acc ess mental health resources at school. Establish a home visit program and provide support and time for educators and/or mental health professionals to perform home visits and meetings with families and guardians. Increase awareness of avai lable school and LEA human resources support for all staff, including where to find mental health support and who to contact and when. Leverage local wellness resources from local health departments, community partners , or others to provide services to stu dents, teachers, and staff remotely or in person. Implement and Integrate Evidence -Based Approaches to Social, Emotional, and Mental Well -Being Administer and analyze school climate and other surveys to determine areas of improvement for educators, students, families, and communities and monitor progress in areas of need. Analyze and use existing data on attendance, academic success, and discipline to identify students in need of additional s upports and guide improvements. Create student -teacher advisory groups and provide professional development to educators leading these groups. School leaders can build tim e into the schedule for these groups to regular ly meet to build strong teacher -studen t relationships and improve school engagement. 28 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires s chool districts to ensure English learner students can meanin gfully participate in all programs and activities of the school district , including couns eling services , to ensure meaningful communication with LEP parents in a language they can understand , and to adequately notify LEP parents of information about any pr ogram, service, or activity of a school district or SEA that is called t o the attention o f English Speaking parents . See e.g., U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice, \"Dear Colleague Letter: English Learner Students and Limited English Proficient Parents,\" (Jan. 7, 2015), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/col league -el-201501.p df. 29 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prot ects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disabili ty by entities that receive Departmen t Federal financial assistance. Subtitle A of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability in services, programs, and ac tivities provided by State and local government entities , regardless of whether or not those entities receive Federal financial assistance . 56 Implement and integrate evidence -based practices within a Multi -Tiered System of Support (MTSS). An MTSS approach, including professional development, can help create a po sitive, safe, affirming, and welcoming school environment; build strong relationships between students and staff; establish consistent routines; promote and reinforce positive expectations; inform rigorous, en gaging, and culturally and linguistically inclu sive instruction; and provide clear an d supportive feedback to students. Develop and implement fair discipline policies that emphasize preventive practices and strategies that help address social, emotional, a nd mental health needs, such as restorative jus tice programs that are culturally and linguistically responsive and support the social and emotional well -being of all students. Provide professional development to all staff on how they can support the well -being of students within their specific roles, r ecognize and value student diversity, and specifically affirm populations who have exp erienced inequities to ensure mental health supports build on students' strengths and are welcoming and inclusive. Expand full-service community schools , which provide and better integrate ac ademic, social, and health care servic es for students and students' family members. ESSER and GEER funds may also be used to evaluate students who may have a disability under IDEA and Section 504, including those who have mental health -related needs as a result of their disability, or to provide equipment, services, and supports that are individually determined as necessary to provide FAPE to an eligible student (commonly referred to as related services )30 under IDEA or Section 504, as applicable. Please also refer to section I in volume 2 of t he Department's COVID -19 Handbook . Additional information about supporting student information on providing safe and supportive l earning environments, including addres sing student and educator mental health, is available from the National Center on Safe and Supportive Learning Environments at https://safesupportivelearning.ed.g ov. More information on improving sch ool climate and school safety through the implementation of positive behavioral interventions and supports is available from the Center on Positive Behavioral Inter ventions and Supports at https://www.pbis.org/ . C-15. How m ay an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to support evidence -based literacy programs ? As noted in FAQs A -4 and A -9, SEAs and LEA s must implement evidence -based st rategies to address the academic impact of lost instruc tional time through the required ARP E SSER reservation of funds . Many parents and educators are especially concerned about the loss of in -person instructional time on students ' early literacy skills. ESSER and GEER funds may be used to support comprehensiv e State and local literacy programs that are needed due to the COVID -19 pandemic (e.g., to address loss of literacy skills as a result of the pandemic) . It is important that LEAs invest in evidence -based practices to support learners, including in early li teracy, whether they are learning remo tely or in person. SEAs and LEAs may also us e ESSER and GEER funds for multi -tiered systems of support for English learners and to provide specially designed instruction for students with disabilities for literacy deve lopment and language acquisition . Fund s may also be used for parent training and f amily literacy services in the use of early learning strategies that bring in the child 's environment and experiences to promote literacy skills . Effective 30 See the definition of \"re lated services\" in the IDEA at 20 34 CFR \u00a7 300.34; see also Appendix to 34 CFR part 104 at \u00b6 23. Possibl e related services include psychological services, school health and school nurse services, social work services in schools, couns eling services, parent counseling and training, and medical services provided by a licens ed physician for diagnostic and evalu ation purposes only. 57 strategies to supp ort student learning are further descr ibed in Volume 2 of at: an LE A use ESSER and GEE R funds to provide meals for students? (Updated December 7, 2022 ) Yes, under certain circumstances. Typically, an LEA has other means of providing for food services, such as through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or other Federal programs. As a result, the Depa rtment encourages LEAs to use those Federal funds with the specific purpose of providing food services to students prior to using ESSER or GEER funds for this purpose. However, if such funding is not available, or additional funds are ne cessary, an LEA may use ESSER or GEER funds to provide meals if the need arises from or relates to recovery from the pandemic. For example, ESSER or GEER funds could be used to increase food service staff capacity; cover additional labor costs associated w ith serving meals t o students during the pandemic; or support COVID -19 pandemic -related expenses, such as school meal service equipment/supplies, meal packaging, and transportation services. Please note that, since 2020, the USDA has provided nationwide f lexibilities and wa ivers consistent with its existing authority and new legislation, including the recent Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022 , which extends certain flexibilities to summer 2022 and through school year 2022 -2023. Using this flexibility, USDA will be able to provide temporary, higher reimbursement rates for school lunches and breakfasts ser ved, as well as meals and snacks served in the Child and Adult Care Food Program.31 C-16.a. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to cover the costs of waiving the outstanding school meals balance of a student from low -income backgrounds? (New December 7, 2022 ) To the extent a low -income family's ability to pay for school meals has been impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, an LEA may use ESSER or GEER funds to cover the student's school lunch balance. As noted in FAQ C -16, the Department encourages the LEA to first utiliz e funding and flexibilities provided by USDA in addressing the costs associated with providing school meals. C-17. How may an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to specifically support high school seniors? ESSER and GEER funds may be used to assis t high school seniors with post-high school planning, including the additional costs to schools of providing these supports to students in a fully in -person, hybrid, or remote environment. For example, ESSER and GEER funds may be used to pay college applic ation fees for low -income students or to support the salaries of additional counselors to assist students with exploring options for careers and postsecondary study, navigating the college application process, completing the Free Application for Federal Studen t Aid (FAFSA) , and conducting parental and student information sessions. Funds may also be used for stipends or incentives for educators taking on additional responsibilities to provide post -high school planning for high school seniors , consistent with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.430(f) (i.e., incentive pay is given pursuant to an established plan, which cou ld be established in response t o the COVID -19 pandemic ). Funds may also be used to support summer bridge programs to help students make the successful transition to postsecondary education , training, pre -apprenticeship, registered apprenticeship, or other career pathway programs . Finall y, ESSER and GEER funds may be used for t ransition services for high school seniors with an IEP to facilitate their transition from school to post-school activities . 31 For more informa tion see C-18. May an use ESSER and GEER funds to support s tudents who graduated high school in the class of 2020 (and students who will graduate in 2021) who have not yet successfully transitioned to college or careers? Yes. Consistent with Perkins V, a n LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to support forme r students who graduated high school in the class of 2020 or who will graduate in 2021 (i.e., during the pandemic) but have not yet successfully transitioned to college or careers . For example, an LEA may provide college or career counseling, assistance wi th college applications or entry into job t raining programs, job training, postsecondary counseling and related services , including for associate and baccalaureate degree programs, and financial literacy. C-19. May an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to suppo rt distance learning, including the purchas e of educational technology for student use? Yes. An LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds for activities that support distance education and promote long-term improvements in technology infrastructure and operations and their effective use. These activities m ight include providing online learning to all students, including students with disabilities, English learners, students experiencing homelessness, and students in foster care; and training educators in the effective implementation of online learning. To s uppo rt the continuity of learning, an LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to p urchase educational technology for student and educator use, including : Mobile technology devices such as tablets and laptops ; Providing off -campus access to reliable, high -speed internet for students and teachers through the purchase of internet -connected devices/equipment, mobile hotspots, wireless service plans, or installation of Community Wi -Fi Hotspots, especially in underserved communities; Teleconferencing applications or programs; Software/online/virtual online/virtual tutoring curriculum/programs, learning management systems; Technology accessories, such as headphones, speakers, la ptop cameras ; and Assistive technology devices,32 such as d edicated communication devices and applications for text-to-speech, graphic organizers, or word prediction. Supporting distance learning requires the effective use of technology by educators. Fun ding may also be used to provide professional development, including through professional learning communities, to support educators in effectively using technology to provide meaningful learning opportunities for students that are aligned with grade -level expectations. Funds may also be used to support other scho ol personnel such as speech therapists, counselors , and social workers, to effectively provid e student services virtually as needed . C-20. May an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds for a pre -kindergart en or other early childhood education program? Yes. Because an early childhood education program is an allowable use of funds under the ESEA and IDEA , it is allowable under ESSER and GEER . An \"early childhood education program\" is (1) a Head Start progra m or an Early Head Start program carried out under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et 32 IDEA defines \"assistive technology device\" as any item, piece of equipm ent, or product system, whether acquired commercial off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability. The term does not inclu de a medical device that is surgical ly implanted, or the replacement of such device. 34 CFR \u00a7 300.5. 59 seq.), including a migrant or seasonal Head Start program, an Indian Head Start program, or a Head Start program or an Early Head Start program that also receives Stat e funding; (2) a State licensed or regulated child car e program; or (3) a program that serves children from birth through age six that addresses the children's cognitive (including language, early literacy, and early mathematics), social, emotional, and physical development; and is either: a State prekinderga rten program; a program authorized under section 619 or Part C of the IDEA (see FAQ C-5); or a program operated by an LEA. (See section 8101(16) of the ESEA.) In addition, ESSER funds may be used for ot her activities that are necessary to maintain the operation of and continuity of services in LEAs and continuing to employ existing staff of the LEA. As a result, ESSER funds could be used to prevent layoffs or service cuts to existing LEA early childhood educ ation programs. C-21. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to serve adults, including English learners, who are eligible to be served under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act? Yes. An LEA may use ESSER and GEER fund s for any activity authorized by the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) , which is Title II of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These activities could include: Conducting outreach activities to re -enroll eligible adults who may ha ve discontinued their attendan ce due to the COVID -19 pandemic; Providing career counseling for eligible adults who suffered job loss as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic; Purchasing technology (including laptops, Wi -Fi hotspots, or tablets) that enable adu lt learners to access virtual instruction; Professional development for adult education instructors in the effective implementation of online learning; Providing instruction to improve digital literacy of adult learners, including English learners, to impr ove digital access and inclusi on; Assessing the skills and educational progress of adult learners using virtual assessment tools; and Accessing PPE and cleaning and disinfecting classrooms used during the regular school day so that they may be used for adult education and literacy acti vities in the evening . C-22. May ESSER and GEER funds be used for career and technical education? Yes. An LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds for any activity authorized by Perkins V. These activities could include, for example: Updating the comprehensive local needs assessment required by section 134(c) of Perkins V to reflect changes in the labor marke t caused by the COVID -19 pandemic; Providing ridesharing services to transport students to shared -time area career and technical education centers or work -based learning opportunities; Adjusting curriculum to account for the academic impact of lost instruc tional time or to cover technical skills that could not be addressed during remote instruction; Providing professional development on the delivery of remote classroom instruction and virtual or remote work -based learning opportunities; Purchasing remote te st-proctoring services so that students can participate remotely in assessments for industry -recognized credentials; Implementing simulated work -based lear ning or school -based enterprises to replace work -based learning opportunities that are no longer ava ilable in the community due to the COVID -19 pandemic ; 60 Providing support to low -income students for college application fees; and Supporting students who gra duated high school in the class of 2020 and students who will graduate in the class of 2021 ( i.e., d uring the pandemic) but have not yet successfully transitioned to college or careers by providing, for example, college or career counseling, assistance wit h college applications , entry into job training programs, and financial literacy . C-23. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to re -engage students who have not been able to participate in in -person and/or remote instruction during the COVID -19 pandemic? Yes. LEA s should identify opportunities to re -engage students who se schools have not been s uccessful in engaging them during the COVID -19 pandemic. LEAs may use indicators such as chronic absenteeism (during in -person and/or remote instruction) to identify stu dents in need of targeted support and services , as well as more generally identifying w hich students have lost the greatest number of in -person instructional days since the beginning of the COVID -19 pandemic. ESSER and GEER funds may be used to provide aca demi c, social, emotional, behavioral, and, in particular , mental health support s to add ress the impacts of isolation during this period . In addition, ESSER and GEER funds may be used to conduct child find activities to identify, locate, and evaluate studen ts who are suspected of having disabilities and need special education and related serv ices under the IDEA . ESSER and GEER funds may also support broader activities that re -engage disconnected youth and reduce community violence in places where the COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated inequities , leading to increases in the number of disconnected youth and violence . This may include summer learning and enrichment programming targeted towards the needs of high school students most likely to be impacted by commu nity violence. C-23.a. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to provide incentiv e payments directly to parents and students to encourage students to attend school? (New December 7, 2022 ) No. Using ESSER or GEER funds to pay students or families for undertaking a mandatory ac tivity, such as attending school, or to pay family members to ensure the students attend school, is not an allowable use of ESSER or GEER funds. However, there are many possible uses of ESSER and GEER funds to support programs intended to help students sta y in school and/or transition to postsecondary education, including many outlined in these FAQs (e.g., FAQs C -11 and C -23). C-24. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to implement community violence intervention strategies? Yes. Community violen ce interventi on (CVI) strategies address students' social, emotional, mental health , and academic development and are especially important in the context of the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on previously underserved groups of students . Purposeful s trategies to re -engage disconnected youth through youth violence reductio n programs, mentorship, and strengthening youth skills through workforce engagement and training also have the potential to reduce community violence. Effective strategie s are further described in Volume 2 of the Department's COVID -19 Handbook available at : https://www2.ed.gov/documents/coronavirus/reopening -2.pdf . Additional information on CVI strategies and investments is included in the Administration 's Fact Sheet available at: Enrichment C-25. What kinds of summer pr ograms m ay ESSER and GEER funds support? ESSER and GEER funds may provide broad support for summer learning and enrichment programs. Given that this summer affords students a critical opportunity , LEAs should consider a variety of options for procuring su mmer ser vices with ESSER and GEER funds , including programs run by non -profit or community organizations as well as those run by the LEA. Effective summer programming can address students' social, emotional, mental health , and academic needs t hrough a comb ination of activities that include strong partnerships with community -based organizations and other summer providers, including summer camps. These partnerships can help to sustain these programs and can also support programs in rural and remo te communitie s. States and LEAs should maximize enrollment in summer programs, with a particular focus on underserved students and students most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, including providing transportation and meal services. Programs shoul d target students of all ages, including high school students , and can include work -based or service -learning opportunities or summer bridge programs to support successful educational transitions . Moreover, an SEA must reserve at least 1 percent of its total ARP ESSER allocat ion for evidence -based summer enrichment programs, and LEAs must reserve at least 20 percent of their ARP ESSER funds to address the academic impact of lost instructional time through the implementation of evidence -based interventions , which m ay include su mmer programs , particularly to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved student subgroups. Evidence -based summer learning and enrichment programs are further described in Volume 2 of the Department's be used for summer job or service -learning programs for h igh schoo l students? Yes. As part of State and LEA efforts to mitigate lost instructional time due to the COVID -19 pandemic , ESSER and GEER funds may be used to support summer learning and enrichment programs that provide training , work -based learning, and jobs to high school students. Funds may be used both to support the training that high school students receive and to supplement the pay provided to students by employers that participate in the summer jobs program. Funds may also be used to support service learn ing or other volunteer opportunities for high school students. C-27. Do Federal procurement requirements permit noncompetitive procurements , if necessary, to enable an SEA or LEA to use ARP ESSER funds to operate a summer enrichment program in 2021? Yes. Under the Un iform Guidance in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.317, an SEA, \"[w]hen procuring property and services under a Federal award, must foll ow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non-Federal funds. \" Thus, an SEA is authorized under the U niform Guidan ce to use any authority provided for in its State procurement policies and procedures that allows for noncompetitiv e procurements. For example , if an SEA has flexibility under its State procurement procedures to allow a sole source contract, p articularly d uring an emergency such as the COVID -19 pandemic, the SEA may procure contracts with ARP ESSER funds in accordance with that flexibility. 62 Under the Uniform Guidance, all other non -Federal entities, including LEAs, must follow the procurement provisions in 2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.318 through 200.327. Under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.320(c), an LEA may, to the extent doing so is consistent with its policies and procedures, use noncompetitive procurement if any of the following conditions are met: 1. The acquisition of pro perty or serv ices, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro -purchase threshold ($50,000); 2. The item is avai lable only from a single source; 3. The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from publicizing a co mpetitive solicitation; 4. The Federal awarding agency or pass -through entity expressly authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written request from the non -Federal entity; or 5. After solicitation of a number of sources, competitio n is determin ed inadequate. Consistent with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.320(c)(3), an LEA may determine that its response to the COVID -19 pande mic qualifies as a public exigency or emergency that does not permit the delay that would result from competitive bidding. Under these circum stances, and to the degree doing so is consistent with its own policies and procedures, an LEA could use noncompeti tive procurement. The LEA should consult with its SEA before using this authority. Also, under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.320(c)(4), an SEA, to the extent d oing so is consistent with its State procurement policies and procedures, may authorize an LEA to use noncompetitiv e procurement in response to a written request. In the alternative, the Department may grant similar flexibility. 63 D. Using E SSER and GEER Funds to Support Educators and Other School Staff D-1. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to stabilize and support the educator workforce? (Updated December 7, 2022 ) Yes. ESSER or GEER funds may be used to stabilize and support the educator wo rkforce, including implementat ion of both short - and long -term strategies to address educator shortages to help ensure continuity of ope rations. Funds may also be used to hire and expand student access to a well -prepared, diverse educator workforce. Exampl es of specific strategies that could be employed to stabilize and support the educator workforce include: Increasing educator and staff compensation by offering hiring and retention bonuses, working toward permanent salary increases, providing premium pay , and leveraging flexibilities to bring retired educators back to the classroom or retain current staff eligible for retirement.33 Building and maintaining a cadre of high -quality substitute teachers by strengthening recruitment and training programs and i ncreasing compensation. To cre ate stability and certainty and promote learning recovery, substitute teachers can be assigned to a singl e school for a full school year. ESSER or GEER funds may also be used to remove barriers so that retirees or those licens ed in another state can serve as substitutes or paraprofessionals. Expanding and improving support for educator and staff well-being by providing supported time for debrief sessions and peer -to-peer support, increasing access to mental health supports and communicating the availability of those mental health supports, reducing educator workloads by ensuring staff planning tim e is scheduled into work hours, and using flexible and creative scheduling to promote educator collaboration. Supporting educators als o means acknowledging the extr aordinary workload presented by the pandemic and pandemic recovery efforts; LEAs can respond by using ESSER or GEER resources to increase the availability of qualified adults and personnel to support educators, students, and s taff. For example, LEAs can pa rtner with institutions of higher education, community -based organizations, nonprofit organi zations, and businesses to provide additional support for educators and students through teaching candidates and well -trained voluntee rs and other additional staff. The Department launched the National Partnership for Student Success , a public -private partnership, to help increase the number of tutors, mentors, student success coaches, postsecondary transi tion coaches and integrated student support coordinators to help students get back on track, which can help stabilize and support the educator workforce while building the pipeline of future teachers. ESSER and GEER funds may be used to meet AmeriCorps mat ching requirements; AmeriCorps members may in turn serve as tutors, mentors and student succ ess coaches, assist with additional administrative responsibilities resulting from the pandemic, and provide creative enrichment oppor tunities. For more information on using Department funds to meet AmeriCorps matching requirements, please see https://www2.ed.gov/policy/fund/guid/americo rps-matching -letter.pdf?src=gr ants-page . In addition, the Department launched the Engage Every Student initiative to help expand high - quality out -of-school time learning opportunities, which ESSER and GEE R can support. Investing in th e educator pipeline through loan forgiveness, grants, a variety of educator preparation programs (e.g., grow -your-own initiatives, teacher residency programs, teacher apprenticeships), or service scholarship programs to suppor t pathways into the profession and encouraging newly certified teachers to commit to teaching in high -need areas and subjects. In so 33 The Internal Revenue Service issued FAQs clarifying that, in som e instances, retirees can return to work and still receive their pensions or remain on th e job and begin receiving pension pa yments, where pension plans permit such approaches (pension plans can also be amended to create these incentives). For additional i nformation, 64 doing, State, LEA, and higher education leaders can answer the Call to Actio n to use pandemic relief funds to grow the education p rofession and help students recover. ESSER or GEER funds, alone or in combination with Higher Education Emergency Relief funds, can support partnerships with educator prep aration programs to expand opp ortunities for extensive clinical experience to teachin g candidates, including leveraging candidates to provide additional support to students and address the impact of lost instructional time. ESSER or GEER funds may also b e used to recruit, hire, and r etain a diverse school staff, including through high -quality induction, and mentoring programs. ESSER or GEER funds may also be used to provide teachers professional learning opportunities on strategies for learning recovery. In using these funds, an LEA should consider how to build short - and long -term capac ity and sustain its efforts after the funding is no longer available. Additional information on evidence -based approaches to stabilizing the educator work force are described in Volume 2 of the topic at https://oese.ed.gov/files/2021/12/21 Shortages.pdf . D-1.a. How may ESSER and GEER funds be leveraged with funding and initiatives of other Federal agencies to promote education workforce stability? (New December 7, 2022 ) In general, ESSER or GEER fu nds may be used in combination with other Feder al funds, so long as separate documentation and cost allocation is maintained for separate funding streams or programs. For additional information on using ESSER and GEER funds along with other Federal funds, see FAQ A -17. Steps taken by other Federal age ncies to promote education workforce stability inclu de: As described above in FAQ D -1, the Internal Revenue Service issued FAQs clarifying that, in some instances, retirees can return to work and still receive their pensions or remain on the job and begin receiving pension payments, where pension plans perm it such approaches (pension plans can also be amended to create these incentives). For additional information, please see Department of Labor recently approved the first registered apprenticeship programs for teachi ng, which expand options for \"grow your own\" and residency programs that allow candidates to be paid while they gain clinical experience and complete coursewo rk leading to full certification. ESSER and GEE R funds may support the development and implementat ion of such programs. To stabilize the school bus driver workforce, ESSER or GEER funds could be used to recruit, train, and pay for commercial licensing of n ew school bus drivers. D-2. May an LEA use ESS ER and GEER funds to hire additional health support staff? Yes. ESSER and GEER f unds may be used to hire new counselors, nurses, social workers , and other health support staff to help students and staff with their emotional and physical well -being and hel p students and staff deal with the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. An LEA should consider how to use 65 the funds in ways that will build its short - and long -term capacity and be sustained after the funding is n o longer available . D-3. Must an entity that receives ESSER or GEER funds under the CARES Act or CRRSA Act continue to pay employees and contractors, to the greatest extent practicable, during the period of any disruptions or closures related to COVID -19? Yes. SEAs, LEAs, and an y other entity that receives ESSER I, ESSER II, or GEER funds must assure that they will continue to pay employees and contractors during COVID -19 pandemic -related disruptions or closures to the greatest extent practicable. There is no similar requirement in the ARP Act ; howe ver, ARP ESSER funds may be used to continue to pay employees and contractors. In addition, ESSER and GEER funds may be used to hire new staff and to avoid staff layoffs . See FAQ A-16 for information on requir ements related to documentation for personnel e xpenses in the Uniform Guidance (2 CFR \u00a7 200.430(i) ). D-4. May an LEA u se ESSE R and GEER funds to pay overtime to its salarie d custodians and other staff in order to prepare for a safe reopening of schools and sustain safe school operations? Yes. Paying custodians or other staff overtime to safely reopen schools and to keep the sch ools safely open is allowable under ESSER and G EER. D-5. May an LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to provide childcare services or instructional supervision to the children of teachers and other staff in order to enable them to return to their teaching or ot her school responsibilities? Yes. An LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds for the costs associated with providing childcare and instructional supervision to children o f teachers and staff , so long as certain conditions are met. For example, an LEA might cont ract with a daycare provider to make spaces ava ilable for teachers with young children whose regular daycare services are unavailable due to the COVID -19 pandemic so that those teachers can continue to provide educational services to students . An LEA might also provide a retention incentive to teachers with young children that could offset the cost for childcare in order to retain those teachers, which is an allowable use of funds under part A of title II of the ESEA, if teacher retention is a challenge due to the COVID -19 pandemic . D-6. May an LEA us e ESSER and GEER funds to provide \" premium pay\" or other additional compensation for teachers , principals, and other school personnel, including school nutrition staff and custodians ? Yes. Premium pay must b e reasonable and necessary and consistent with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.430(f) , and given pursuant to an established p lan (which could b e established in response to the COVID -19 pande mic), consistent with applicable collective bargaining agreements and other relevant policies and requirements . D-7. May an LEA that has experienced significant, unbudgeted increases in unem ployment costs use ESSER and GEER funds to pay for th ose costs? Yes. An LEA may use ESSER or GEER funds to pay for unemployment costs if necessary . However, an LEA may want to consider alternate sources of funding for the unemployment expenses, and use ESSER and GEER funds for more traditional education uses to prevent , prepare for, or respond to the COVID -19 66 pandemic . Additionally, as with all grant activities, the use of funds must meet all applicable Uniform Guidance requirements, and be r easonable and necessary to meet the purpose of the programs. 67 E. Additional Fiscal Considerat ions Timelines for Obligating Funds E-1. What is the timeline for a Governor, SEA, or LEA to obligate funds und er ESSER I and GEER I? (Updated December 7, 2022 ) A Governor, S EA, or LEA, as applicable, has until September 30, 2022, to obligate ESSER I and GEER I funds; this includes the 12 -month Tydings Amendment period. (Note that the timeline for obligating funds is distinct from the timeline for a State to award funds within one year of receipt or return them to the Department for reallocation (sections 18002(d) and 18003(f) of the CARES Act).) For additional information on awarding and obligating funds, please s ee Question 10 in available must be obligated by September 30, 2022, grant activities carried out through a valid obligation of fund s may continue beyond that date. Under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.344(a) , ESSER and GEER funds must be liquidated within 1 20 calendar days of the end of the performance per iod. See FAQ E -3.d. for more information. E-2. What is the timeline for a Governor, SEA, or LEA to obligate funds under ESSER II and GEER II? (Updated December 7, 2022 ) A Governor, SEA, or LEA, as applica ble, has until September 30, 2023, to obligate ESSER II and GEER II funds; this i ncludes the 12 -month Tydings Amendment period. (Note that the timeline for obligating funds is distinct from the timeline for a State to award funds within one year of receipt or return them to the Department for reallocation (sections 312(f) and 313(g) of the CRRSA Act).) For additional information on awarding and obligating funds, please see Question 10 in . Although funds must be obligated by September 30, 2023, grant activities carried out through a valid obligation of funds may continue beyond that date. Under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.344(a) , ESSER and GEER funds must be liquidated within 120 calendar days of the end of the performance period. See FAQ E -3.d. for more infor mation. E-3. What is the timeline for an SEA or LEA to obligate fu nds under ARP ESSER? An SEA or LEA has until September 30, 2024 , to obligate the ARP ESSER funds it receives. This includes the 12 -month Tydings Amendment period. Although funds must be ob ligated by September 30, 2024, grant activities carried out through a valid oblig ation of funds may continue beyond that date. Under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.344(a), ESSER funds must be liquidated within 120 calendar days after the end of the performance period (Septem ber 30, 2024). Note that the timeline for obligating funds is dist inct from the timeline for an SEA to make allocations to LEAs. Section 2001(d)(2) of the ARP Act requires an SEA to make allocations to LEAs in an expedited and timely manner and not later than 60 days after receipt of its award, to the extent practicable. Additionall y, the ARP Act requires that an SEA award its ARP ESSER funds within one year of receipt or return them to the Department for reallocation (section 2001(g) of the ARP Act). Wi th respect to funds that an SEA must allocate to LEAs, an SEA will have met the r equirement to award the funds within one year by meeting the requirement in section 2001(d)(2) of the ARP Act to make allocations to LEAs, in an expedited and timely manner an d, to the extent practicable, not later than 60 days after receipt of its 68 award. For funds that an SEA reserves, the SEA must, within one year of receiving the funds, award the funds through grants or contracts or by retaining funds to provide direct servi ces. For additional information on awarding and obligating funds, p lease see Ques tion a shorter peri od of availability for awards made from the ESSER State Reserve than the full period of availability under the applicable ESSER program? (New December 7, 2022 ) Yes, an SEA ma y establish a period of availability for ESSER State Reserve funds, includ ing funds that are award ed to LEAs from the SEA's State Reserve, that is shorter than the full period of availability. For ESSER funds awarded through the formula, by contrast, LEAs must be given the full period of availability to obligate the funds. E-3.b. When must ESSER I, ES SER II, ARP ESSER, GEER I, and GEER II funds be liquidated? (New December 7, 2022 ) Grantees and subgrantees, by regulation, must liquidate funds within 120 calendar days after the program's obligation date (see FAQs E -1, E-2, and E -3) per 2 CFR \u00a7 200.344(b) . If ESSER I and GEER I funds are properly obligated by September 30, 2022, but liqu idation becomes an issue after the obligation deadline, the Department may approve liquidation extension requests on a case -by-case basis upon written request of an S EA or Governor grantee, in accordance with 2 CFR \u00a7 200.344(b) . If approved, an ESSER I or GEER I grantee may have up to 18 months beyond the end of the obligation period to liquidate f unds, although longer requ ests may be considered for construction or extraordinary circumstances. Under a liquidation extension, the delivery of goods and some service s may continue through the end of the liquidation period, so long as a timely and valid o bligation had been made pursuant to 34 CFR \u00a7 76.707 . Because the ESSER II and GEER II obligation period does not end until September 30, 2023, and the ARP ESSER obligation period does not end until September 30, 2024, the Department strongly encourages States and LEAs to obligate and liquida te ESSER II, GEER II, and ARP ESSER funds with urgency on activities that will support s tudents' academic recovery and mental health needs. The Department will determine any process for submitting a Liquidation Extension Request for ESSER II, GEER II, and ARP ESSER funds at a later date. E-3.c. What happens to ESSER and GEER funds that are u nobligated at the end of th e Tydings Amendment deadline? (New December 7, 2022 ) The Department is not able to extend the statutory obligation deadline. Therefore, if th e grantee (SEA or Governor) or any subgrantee is unable to obligate ESSER or GEER funds by the obligation deadline for each program (see FAQs E -1, E-2, and E -3 for the obligation deadlines), then the grantee will not be able to liquidate these funds. These unobligated funds will no longer be available to the grantee or subgrantee and will lapse and return to the U.S. Treasury. E-3.d. H ow long may ESSER or GEER -funded activities continue after the liquidation period? (New December 7, 2022 ) As a preliminary matter, grantees and subgrantees should keep in mind that ESSER and GEER funds are emergency funds that are intended to be utilized in a timely manne r to carry out activities to prevent, prepare for, or respond to COVID -19, including its impact on students . Further, a grantee or subgrantee must obligate ESSER or GEER funds within the period of availability and must liquidate those 69 obligations within 12 0 days of the end of the period of availability ( 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.344(b ) (or within the approved period for a liquidation extension). Generally, it is not good stewardship of Federal funds or prudent business practice to pre pay for services that will extend many years into the future. However, under limited circumstances where a grantee or subgrantee timely obligates ESSER or GEER funds, ESSER - or GEER -funded activities may continue for a reasonable time beyond the liquidatio n period (including an approved late liquidation p eriod). Factors impacting how long ESSER - or GEER -funde d activities may extend past the liquidation period include: Whether the funds were properly obligated and liquidated in a timely manner; Whether th e activities would be allowed to extend beyond the liquidation period under applicable State and local proc urement rules (i.e., a State or LEA must follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non -Federal funds) (see 2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.317 through 200.327 , 200.403(c) ); Whether the extended activities constitute a reasonable and necessary use of Federal funds; and Whether prudent business practices ( 2 CFR \u00a7 200.404(b) & (d) ) and internal controls (which generally limit p repayment) would support the continued activities for the len gth of time proposed. Grantees and subgrantees must obligate funds by each program's deadline, which means that if a grantee or subgrantee enters i nto a contract for activities that continue past the date of obligation and the contractor does not provide the services, the grant ee or subgrantee may not enter into a new contract or obligate those funds for a different allowable use. Instead, those fund s that were obligated for services that were not delivered will remain unused and will be returned to the U .S. Treasury. Because E SSER and GEER are State -administered programs, the SEA or Governor determines whether activities extending past the liquidati on period are allowable under the circumstances. For example, an SEA may determine that it is reasonable and necessary under 2 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.403 -200.404 for an LEA to enter into a multi -year software licensin g contract with a vendor during the period of availability of ARP ESSER funds and to pay for the entirety of the software lice nse within the liquidation period. However, under the contract, the vendor would continue to provide the se rvices (i.e., software and technical support) for some time after the funds had been liquidated. Please note that the SEA, LEA, or subgrantee would be responsible for returning to the Federal government the cost of any services that were paid with Federal funds but not received . Under no circumstances may services extend beyond the date on which funds revert to the U.S. Department of Treasury ( 31 USC \u00a7 1552 ), which occurs four years after the obligation deadlines referenced in FAQs E -1, E-2, and E -3. However, nothing prevents an SEA or LEA from continuing successful activities or services with non -ESSER/GEER funding. Administrative Funds and Indirect Costs E-4. May a Governor or SEA reserve ESSER or GEER funds for administrative costs? Yes. An SEA may reserve \u00bd of 1 percent or le ss of its total ESSER allocation for administrative costs, including both direct and indirect administrative costs. This reservation must come from the portion of funds not required to be allocated to LEAs under the formula and is not subject to the requir ement that funds be \"awarded\" within one year of receipt . Funds for administrative costs under ESSER I remain available to the SEA for obligation thr ough September 30, 2022, while funds for administrative costs 70 under ESSER II remain available to the SEA fo r obligation through September 30, 2023, and funds for administrative costs under ARP ESSER remain available to the SEA for obligation through Septem ber 30, 2024. A Governor may charge as an expense to the GEER fund an amount that is reasonable and necess ary to effectively administer the program consistent with cost principles in the Uniform Guidance. Administrative costs include costs (direct and ind irect) involved in the proper and efficient performance and adm inistration of the GEER fund. However, to ma ximize the funds available for services to students and the public, the Department encourages each Governor and subgrantee to minimize the amount of administrative costs charged to the program. Funds for administ rative costs under GEER I remain available t o the Governor for obligation through September 30, 2022, while administrative costs under GEER II remain available to the Governor for obligation th rough September 30, 2023. E-5. May an LEA use ESSER or GEER funds to defray the costs of administering the program? Yes. An LEA may charge as an expense to the ESSER or GEER fund an amount that is reasonable and necessary to effectively administer the pr ogram consistent with the cost principles in the Uniform Guidance. Administrative costs include costs (dire ct and indirect) involved in the proper and efficient performance and administration of ESSER or GEER funds. For example, an LEA may use ESSER funds to hire personnel to assist in the planning, implementation, and oversight of ESSER fund activities. E-6. May a Governor or SEA determine what constitutes a reasonable and nece ssary amount of funds necessary for an LEA to effectively administer the progra m? Yes. As part of its oversight of the GEER and ESSER funds, a Governor or SEA may determine the amount of ESSER or GEER funds an LEA may use for administration . For example , an SEA or Governor may establish a maximum percentage of funds that an LEA may use to administer the program , absent a demonstration by the LEA that it needs additional funds for admin istration . E-7. May an SEA or LEA consolidate ESSER and GEER administrative funds? Yes. Sections 8201(a) and 8203(a) of the ESEA permit SEAs and L EAs, respectively, to consolidate administrative funds under certain ESEA programs. The Secretary may desig nate additional programs from which administrative funds may be consolidated. Under that authority, the Department designated ESSER I, ESSER II, AR P ESSER, GEER I, and GEER II funds and the Emergency Assistance to Non -Public Schools (EANS) program s (auth orized under both the CRRSA Act and the ARP Act) as programs un der which an SEA or LEA, as applicable, may consolidate administrative funds. An SEA may consolidate administrative funds under two or more of the ESSER I , ESSER II, and ARP ESSER funds, the EANS program, and the GEER I and GEER II funds without also consolidating other ESEA program administrative funds, as long as the SEA can demonstrate that the majority of its resources are derived from non -Federal sources. Specifically, an SEA may consol idate the \u00bd of 1 percent of its ESSER I , ESSER I I and ARP ESSER funds able to be reserved for State administration, the amount of EANS funds availabl e for State administration, and, if the SEA is administering a portion of the GEER I or GEER I I funds on be half of the Governor, a reasonable and necessary amount of those funds. If the SEA consolidates administrative 71 funds under these programs, it is not required to keep separate records for how it uses those administrative funds. Consolidated administ rative funds may be used to administer the programs included in the consolidation as well as for administrative activities designed to enhance the effectiv e and coordinated use of funds under programs included in the consolidation. An LEA may consolidate admin istrative funds under the ESSER I, ESSER I I, ARP ESSER , GEER I, and GEER I I funds with the approval of the SEA to administer the programs included in the consolidation and, as is the case with the consolidated State administrative funds, for administ rative activities designed to enhance the effective and coordinated use of funds under programs included in the consolidation. E-8. May an LEA charge ind irect costs to its ESSER or GEER Fund subgrant? Yes. Indirect costs and rates must comply with the U niform Guidance and the Department's administrative regulations. (See 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 76.560 -76.563 on indirect costs .) Because the ESSER and GEER funds do not have a supplan ting prohibition, an LEA may use its unrestricted indirect cost rate. E-9. How might ESSER or GEER funds affect a n SEA's or LEA's indirect cost rec overies? To obtain indirect cost recoveries , an SEA or LEA is allowed to apply its cur rently negotiated i ndirect cost rate to obligations incurred under ESSER or GEER . The negotiated indirect cost rate for the current fiscal year is based on actual cost information from a prior fiscal year. Therefore, applying the currently negotiated indir ect cost rate to th e increased funding under ESSER or GEER (which was not considered in the indirect cost rate calculation) could result in an over -recovery of indirect costs in the current period. Such an over -recovery will be adjusted in a future fiscal year, there by reduc ing indirect cost recover ies during that future period. To avoid a future compounding effect of fewer program dollars and reduced indirect costs, the Department recommends that an SEA or LEA closely monitor the potential impact of ESSE R and GEER funds on its indirect cost recoveries and consider making appropriate adjustments during the current period (i.e., by potentially recovering less funding for indirect costs in the c urrent period) . Those adjustments will reduce the dollar impact in future years and a llow for stability in future budget s. Additional information about indirect costs can be found at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocfo/intro.html . Revenue Loss E-10. May an SEA or LEA use ESSER and GEER funds to supplement or restore its \"rainy day\" fund rather than use the funds for specific purposes? No. An SE A's or LEA's transfer of ESSER or GEER funds to its \"rainy day\" fund would not constitute an \"obligation\" of the funds. The SEA or LEA must obligate ESSER I and GEER I funds for specific allowable activities by September 30, 2022 . Similarly, the SEA or LEA must obliga te ESSER II and GEER II funds for specific allowable activities by September 30, 2023 and must obligate ARP ESSER funds for specific allowable activities by September 30, 2024 . E-11. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to make up State revenue losses ? Any use of ESSER or GEER funds must be \"to prevent, prepare for, and respond to\" the COVID -19 pandemic . This me ans that ESSER and GEER funds may be used to bridge budget shortfalls if the deficit 72 is related to the COVID -19 pandemic and the ESSER and GEER funds are needed for education -related expenses. However, the CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP Act include detail ed provisions requiring States to maintain effort for elementary and secondary education and higher education, which are designed to keep States from substantially reducing their support for K -12 education and higher education (see the Department's Guidance on Maintenance of Effort Requirements and Waiver Request ). The ARP Act also includes important Maintenance of Equity requiremen ts for both States and LEAs . More information on the Maintenance of Eq uity requirement s, includ ing FAQs and Final Requirements, can be found on the Department's Maintenance of Equity website should be mind ful that ex isting maintenance of effort requirements for other Federal programs, such as Title VIII of the ESEA and IDEA , continue to apply . (See E -12 and E - 14.) As with other Federal funds, ESSER and GEER funds are excluded from these maintenance of effor t calculati ons. E-11.a. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to support local matching requirements under other Federal programs? (New December 7, 2022 ) Generally, no. Federal funds may not be used to meet a matching requirement unless the Federal statute authorizing those funds specifically provides that they may be applied to matching or cost -sharing requirements of another Federal program. The CARES, CR RSA, and ARP Ac ts do not provide specific authority to use ESSER or GEER funds as a match for any other F ederal programs. See the Uniform Guidance provision on matching at 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.306(b)(5) . However, ESSER or GEER funds may be used for cost -sharing or matching for the AmeriCorps program because the AmeriCorps statute authorizes the use of Federal funds for the match; for more information , see: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/fund/guid/americorps Fiscal Considerations E-12. How does the use of ESSER and GEER funds to make up for State and/or local revenue losses impact IDEA's LE A Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirement? IDEA contains an LEA MOE requirement in addition to the State MOE requirements in the CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP Act , and the State and LEA maintenance of equity requirements in the ARP Act . Under section 613( a)(2)(A)(iii) of IDEA and 34 CFR \u00a7 300.203 , an LEA must both: (1) budget, for the education of children with disabilities, at leas t the same amount as the LEA spent fo r that purpose from the same source (either local funds or a combination of State and loc al funds, on an aggregate or per capita basis) in the most recent fiscal year for which information is available; and (2) expend, for the education of children with di sabilities, at least the same amount as the LEA spent for that purpose from the same sour ce (either local funds or a combination of State and local funds, on an aggregate or per capita basis) for the preceding fiscal ye ar. Under IDEA, these budget and expe nditure requirements for LEA MOE are termed \"eligibility\" and \"compliance\" standards, res pectively. While IDEA does not provide for MOE waivers, there are exceptions and an adjustment to the LEA MOE requirements that may allow an LEA to reduce its MOE budg et and expenditures below the level of expenditures for the education of children with di sabilities made by the LEA for the appropriate comparison year (the most recent fiscal year for which information is available (fo r the eligibility standard) and the p receding fiscal year (for the compliance standard)). (See 34 CF R \u00a7\u00a7 300 .204 and 300.205 .) 73 For the purposes of the IDEA, CARES Act , CRRSA Act, and ARP Act funds are considered Federal funds and may not replace State and local funds in LEA MOE calcu lations. As a result, if an LEA uses CARES Act , CRRSA Act, or ARP Act funds to replace State or loc al funding for the education of children with disabilities, this may result in a failure of the LEA to meet the budget and/or expenditure requirements for LE A MOE under IDEA. If an LEA fails to meet the MOE budget requirement, the LEA is not eligible for a n IDEA Part B subgrant. If the LEA fails to meet the MOE expenditure requirement, then the SEA is liable in a recovery action to return non -Federal funds to the Department in an amount equal to the amount of the LEA's MOE shortfall or the amount of the LEA 's IDEA Part B subgrant in that fiscal year, whichever is lower. SEA s may, but are not required to, seek reimbursement from the LEA that failed to meet MOE. OSEP funds a technical assistance center to assist States with the LEA MOE reporting and underlyin g requirements, the Center for IDEA Fiscal Reporting (https://cifr.wested.org/resources/lea -moe/ ). E-13. How does the use of ESSER and GEER funds to make up for State revenue losses impact the IDEA 's Maintenance of State Financial Support (MFS) requirement ? IDEA c ontains a separate State MFS requirement in addition to the maintenance of effort require ments in the CARES Act, CRRSA Act, a nd ARP Act . Under IDEA section 612(a)(18)(A) , \"a State must not reduce the amount of State financial support for special education and related services for students with disabilities, or otherwise made available because of the excess costs of educating tho se children, below the amount of that support for the preceding fiscal year. \" (34 CFR \u00a7 300.163(a) .) For the purposes of IDEA, CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP A ct funds are considered Federal funds and may not replace State funds in MFS calculations. Replacing State appropriations for specia l education and related services with CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP Act funds could resul t in a reduction of the State's amount of State financial support made available for special education and related services below the level for the preceding fiscal ye ar. This would likely trigger an MFS shortfall under IDEA and potential ly result in a reduction of IDEA Part B funds in a future grant equal to the amount of the shortfall. (34 CFR \u00a7 300.163(b). ) Part B of the IDEA allow s the Se cretary to waive th e MFS requirement for one year at a time under 34 CFR \u00a7 300.163(c)(1) if granting a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontr ollable circumstance s such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State. OSEP funds a technical assistance center to assist State s with the MFS reporting and underlying requirements, the Center for IDEA Fiscal Reportin g, https://cifr.wested.org/resources/mfs/ . E-14. How does the use of ESSER and GEER funds to make up for St ate and/or local revenue losses impact the LEA MOE requirement in sec tion 8521 of the ESE A? Section 8521 of the ESEA contains an LEA MOE requirement applicable to covered ESEA programs in addition to the State MOE requirements in the CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP Act , and the State and LEA maintenance of equity requirements in the ARP Act . Under section 8521 and 34 CFR \u00a7 299.5, an LEA 's expenditures for the provision of free public education in the preceding fiscal year may not be less than 90 percent of it s expen ditures in the second preceding fiscal year, determined either by the LEA's combined fiscal effort per student or its aggrega te expenditures of State and local funds . CARES Act, CRRSA A ct, and ARP Act funds are Federa l funds and may not replace State and local funds in LEA MOE calculations. As a result, if an LEA uses CARES Act, CRRSA Act, and ARP Act funds to replace 74 State or loca l funding to provide free public education , the LEA may fail to meet MOE under section 8521. Absent a waiver of the MOE requirement, an SEA must reduce an LEA's allocation f or each covered program by the amount the LEA failed to meet MOE. The Department m ay waive the MOE requirement in section 85 21 of the ESEA if it determines a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstance s or a precipitous decline in the financial resources of an LEA . If an LEA experienced a precipitous decl ine in State and local resources caused by the COVID -19 pandemic , that could warrant the Department's granting an MOE waiver. With respect to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, the statute includ es the example of a natural disaster or a change in the organizational structure of the LEA. In addition to these two examples, there may be other instances of exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances that might warrant when a waiver would be granted , such as a significant reduction in expenditures of S tate and local funds due to temporary clos ures or changes in onsite operations caused by the COVID -19 pandemic . 75 Appendix A -- Allocations MAKING ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF FORMULA SUBGRANTS TO LEAS UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT AND CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE AND RELIEF SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 This tech nical appendix has been prepared for the benefit of Sta te administrators who are tasked with making formula subgrants to LEAs under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) and under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act, 2021's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief component (ESSER II).34 ARP ESSER and ESSER II Req uirements A State educational agency (SEA) must allocate at least 90 percent of its tota l ESSER II grant and ARP ESSER grant by formula to LEAs. The SEA must determine each LEA's ESSER II allocation and ARP ESSER allocation in proportion to the amount of funds the LEA received under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) in the most recent fiscal year ( section 313(c) of the CRRSA Act and section 2001(d)(1) of the ARP Act, respectively). Title I, Part A Subgrants to LEAs For the purpose of allocating ARP ESSER and ESSER II funds to LEAs, the following points regarding Title I, Part A subgrants apply: Federal fiscal year (FY) 2020 Title I, Part A subgrants that were awarded by each SEA to LEAs for the 2020 -2021 scho ol year are the most recent Title I, Part A funds on which an SEA bases ESSER II and ARP ESSER subgrants. Ther efore, with the exception of Step 6 below relating to new or significantly expanded charter school LEAs in school year 2021 -2022, an SEA has the d ata needed to calculate ESSER II and ARP ESSER LEA allocations because the SEA has alread y determined the fiscal year ( FY) 2020 Title I, Part A LEA subgrant amounts. FY 2020 Title I, Part A subgrants are those that each SEA determined under Title I, Part A, Subpart 2: that is, the aggregate of basic grants, concentration grants, targeted gran ts, and education fin ance incentive grants for which each LEA was eligible after the SEA adjusted, in accordance with the regulations in 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.70 -200.7535 and 2 00.100,36 the LEA allocations on the Census list 34 Guidance for the CARES Act allocations (\"ESSER I\") was included in the Technical App endix in the ESSER FAQs . 35 The regulations in CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.70 -200.75 addres s adjusting for LEAs that are not on the Census list (such as charter school LEAs), apply ing the hold harmless after adjusting for LEAs that are not on the Census list, alternative allocations for LEAs under 20,000 total population, and special procedures for calculating concentration grants in small States, available at: https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi -bin/text - idx?SID=ea8f771199b0aa9a1f068857ea552084&mc=true&node=sg34.1.200_169.sg5&rgn=div7 . 36 CFR \u00a7 200.100 address an SEA's reservation of funds for school improvement under ESEA section 1003, including application of the special rule in section 1003(h); funds for State administration under ESEA 76 calculated by the Department.37regulations in 34 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 200.70-200.7538 and 200.100,39 the LEA allocations on the Census list calculated by the Department.40 The following are not part of FY 2020 Title I, Part A LEA subgrant amounts an SEA uses to calculate ESSER LEA allocations: o FY 2017, FY 2018, o r FY 2019 carryover funds. o Funds reallocated to an LEA by the SEA under ESEA section 1126(c). o Funds an LEA received under ESEA section 1003 for school improvement. o Funds an LEA received under ESEA section 1003A for direct student services. o Funds an LEA re ceived to carry out Title I, Part D, Subpart 2 (i.e., funds generated by children in local institutions for delinquent children). o Reductions to an LEA's FY 2020 Title I, Part A subgrant due to a failure to meet the ESEA's maintenance of effort requirements in the preceding fiscal year and at least once in the five immediately preceding fiscal years. o Any adjustments from FY 2019 that an SEA made t o FY 2020 Title I, Part A subgrant amounts. o FY 2020 Title I, Part A funds that an LEA declined. Steps to Calcu late ARP ESSER Subgrants and ESSER II Subgrants to LEAs Note to users: as the same requirements apply to determining ESSER II and ARP ESSER subgrants, for clarity an d space limitations the tables presented in the steps below refer to \"ARP ESSER.\" (The sa me information applies to ESSER II.) These steps describe the procedures an SEA follows to calculate the ESSER II LEA allocations and ARP ESSE R LEA allocations. An SE A can complete Steps 1 through 5 in order to make ESSER II subgrants and ARP ESSER subgra nts to existing eligible LEAs; the SEA completes Step 6 once it has determined whether any new charter school LEAs have opened for school year 2021 -2022 or any existin g charter school LEAs have significantly expanded for school year 2021 -2022 (e.g., during the fall of 2021).

Subtracting the: o ESSER II SEA Reserve amount from the SEA's to tal ESSER II allocation to determine the total amount available for LEA subgrants. o ARP ESSER SEA Reserve amount from the SEA's total ARP ESSER allocation to determine the total amount available for ARP ESSER LEA subgrants. If a State has charter school L EAs, subtracting from the total amount of: o ESSER II funds available for LEA subgrants a reasonable amount to retain for new charter school LEAs or charter school LEAs that will significantly expand in school year 2021 -2022 consistent with ESEA section 4306 . o ARP ESSER funds available for LEA subgrants a reasonable amount to retain for new charter school LEAs or charter school LEAs that will significantly expand in school year 2021 -2022 consistent with ESEA section 4306. (Temporarily retaining funds from the total amount of ESSER II and ARP ESSER funds available for LEA subgrants for new charter school LE As or charter school LEAs that will significantly expand in school y ear 2021 -2022 will reduce the likelihood that an SEA will have to reduce the ESSER II and ARP ESSER subgrants of other LEAs once the SEA has the data to calculate the ESSER II and ARP ESSE R subgrants of such charter school LEAs.

(See 34 CFR\u00a7 76.788). Thus, this step likely will not occur until fall 2021. 80 Example of Step 6a Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4 Column 5 Column 6 LEA operating in school year 2020 -2021 Proportion of ARP ESSER formula funds that the LEA receives (From Step 4) Initial ARP ESSER LEA subgrant (From Step 5) Amount SEA retained for new or significantly expanded charter LEAs (from Step 1) ARP ESS ER LEA allocation of retained amount (Column 4 multiplied by Column 2) Revised ARP ESSER LEA subgrant (Column 3 plus Column 5) LEA for schoo l year 2021 -2022 there are new charter school LEAs or charter school LEAs that significantly expanded in a State) : The SEA recalculates its ESSER II LEA allocations and ARP ESSER LEA allocations based on the total amount available for LEA subgrants in orde r to determine the ESSER II subgrant amounts and ARP ESSER subgrant amounts for a new charter school LEA or a significantly expanded charter school LEA and makes any n ecessary adjustments to the ESSER II LEA subgrants and ARP ESSER LEA subgrants that the S EA already awarded based on the calculations desc ribed in Steps 1 through 5. As background, for a newly opened charter school LEA or a charter school LEA that signif icantly expands for school year 2021 -2022, an SEA does not have an actual FY 2020 Title I , Part A subgrant amount for the LEA that reflect s either status. ESEA section 4306(a), however, requires, with respect to any funds that the Department allocates to S tates on a formula basis (including ESSER II and ARP ESSER), a State to: [T]ake such mea sures as are necessary to ensure that every chart er school receives the Federal funding for which the charter school is eligible not later than [five] months after the charter school first opens, notwithstanding the fact that the identity and characteristi cs of the students enrolling in that charter scho ol are not fully and completely determined until that charter school actually opens. The measures similarly shall ensu re that every charter school expanding its enrollment in any subsequent year of operation receives the Federal funding for which the chart er school is eligible not later than [five] months after such expansion. In order to comply with ESEA section 4306(a ), an SEA must determine an ESSER II LEA subgrant allocation and ARP ESSER LEA subgrant a llocation for a new or significantly expanded cha rter school in 81 school year 2021 -2022 by deriving what the charter school LEA's FY 2020 Title I, Part A allocation woul d have been based on the characteristics of the charter school LEA's students in school y ear 2021 - 2022. As detailed in the next paragraph, an SEA already derives this amount for calculating FY 2021 Title I, Part A allocations to comply with ESEA section 43 06(c) . Independent of the CRSSA Act and ARP Act, as part of calculating a new or signif icantly expanded charter school LEA's FY 2021 Tit le I, Part A allocation, ESEA section 4306(c) requires an SEA, for purposes of implementing the Title I, Part A hold -harmless protections in ESEA sections 1122(c) and 1125A(f)(3) for a newly opened or signif icantly expanded charter school LEA, to derive a hold-harmless base under each Title I, Part A formula for FY 2020 that reflects the new or significantly expanded enrollment of the charter school LEA.42 Therefore, in order to calculate the ESSER II allocati on and ARP ESSER allocation of a new or signific antly expanded charter school LEA, an SEA will consider such an LEA's FY 2020 Title I, Part A allocation as the sum of its hold harmless base under each Title I, Part A formula that the SEA calculates for FY 2021 Title I, Part A allocations in accordance w ith ESEA section 4306(c). An example of calculating the ESSER II allocation and ARP ESSER allocation for a new or signi ficantly expanded charter school LEA and adjusting the ESSER II subgrants and ARP ESSER subgrants an SEA already made (as shown in Steps 1-5) follows on the next page. 42 For more information on ESEA section 4306(c) see pages 4 -7 in the Department's ESSA fiscal changes, at: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/es sa/essaguidance160477.pdf . 82 Example of Step 6b Column 1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4 Column 5 Column 6 Column 7 LEA Initial ARP ESSER LEA subgrant (From Step 5) FY 2020 Title I, Part A subgrant amoun t or ESEA Section 4306(c) FY 2020 derived Title I, Part A hold harmless base* LEA proportion of Column 3 total (Column 3 LEA amount divided by Column 3 total) Total a mount for LEA subgrants (from Step 1) Revised ARP ESSER LEA subgrant (Column 5 multiplie d by Column 4) Difference between revised ARP ESSER LEA subgrant and initial subgrant (Column 6 minus LEA 3 (significantly 2020 -2021) $203,122 $357,479* $242,505 LEA 11 (new derived FY 2020 Title I, Part A hold harmless base that the SEA calculates in accordance with ESEA section 4306(c) for a charter school LEA t hat opens or significantly expands for school year 2021 -2022. **Figure does not equal the actual total of FY 2020 Title I, Part A subgrants from Step 2 due to the SEA's deriving hold harmless bases for the new and significantly expanded charter school LEAs, as required by ESEA section 4306(c). 83 Appendix B -- Related FAQs Section 1: Vaccinations and Testing Use of Funds for COVID -19 Vaccinations and Testing Listed below are frequently asked questions about acceptable uses of ESSER and GEER funds43 to State educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) to support COVID -19 vaccinations and testing. Other than statut ory and regulatory requirements included in the document, the contents of this guidance do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing require ments under the law or agency policies. 1. May ESSER and GEER funds be used to provide COVID -19 vaccinations to teachers, staff, and eligible students? Yes. Because ESSER and GEER funds may be used to implement public health protocols, including, to the greatest extent practicable, policies in line with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the reopening and operation of school facilit ies to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other staff, providing COVID -19 vaccinations is an allowable use of ESSER and GEER funds. Allowable vaccination outreach efforts in general could include activities to create awareness and build confidence, facilitate clinics, and provide incentives such as paid time o ff for staff to get vaccinated. In cases where administrative fees are required to obtain a vaccination, ESSER or GEER funds may be used to offset the cost as long as the cost is reasonable. 2. Is COVID -19 testing for students and school staff an allowable use of ESSER and GEER funds? Yes. Because ESSER and GEER funds may be used for public health protocols, including, to the greatest extent practicable, policies in line with guidance from the CDC for the reopening and operation of school facilities to effe ctively maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other staff, providing COVID -19 testing is an allowable use of ESSER and GEER funds. SEAs and LEAs should consult with State and local health officials to ensure the adequacy of any SEA or LEA COVID -19 testing program and that testing procedures comply with all applicable laws and requirements, including those related to priva cy, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), and the confidentiality of information requirements under Part B and Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Plea se note that the Department of Health and Human Services separately provided $10 billion under the ARP Act to States as Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases (ELC) Reopening Schools awards to support the implementation of COVI D-19 testing programs, as recommended by the CDC, in K -12 schools. This funding was deplo yed quickly through State health departments in order to help LEAs safely reopen schools in the remaining months of school year 2020 - 2021, during summer activities, a nd in the subsequent school year. State and local health departments will 43 For purposes of this document, references to ESSER and GEER funds include funds awarded under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Econom ic Security (CARES) Act (ESSER I and GEER I); the Coronavirus Response and Act (ESSER II and GEER II); and the American Rescue Plan (APR) Act (ARP ESSER). 84 provide technic al assistance to LEAs and schools in establishing COVID -19 testing programs. More information on the program can be found at: www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dpei/pdf/guidance -elc-reopening - schools -508.pdf . 85 Sectio n 2: COVID -19 Testing Incentives F act Sheet Fact Sheet: Using American Rescue Plan Act funding to provide incentives for participation in school -based COVID -19 screening testing A local educational agency (LEA) may use American Rescue Plan Act Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER) funds to provide incentives to parents or guardians whose children partic ipate in school -based COVID -19 screening testing.44 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), sc reening testing identifies infected people, in cluding those with or without symptoms (or before development of symptoms) who may be contagious, so that measures can be taken to prevent further transmission. In K-12 schools, screening testing can help promptly identify and isolate cases, allow schools to quarantine those who may have been exposed to COVID -19 and who are not fully vaccinate d, and identify clusters to reduce the risk of interruptions to in -person education.45 An LEA may use ARP ESSER funds\u2014as well as other Federal pandemic recovery resourc es for early childhood, elementary, and secondary education in the Education Stabilizatio n Fund46\u2014to provide reasonable incentives to parents or guardians whose children participate in school -based COVID -19 screening testing in order to increase the number of participants in the program. Providing reasonable incentives to parents or guardians w hose children participate in school -based COVID -19 screening testing is an allowable use of funds because it is a strategy that an LEA may implement in alignment with CDC guidance on screening testing to promptly identify COVID -19 cases, clusters, and outb reaks, which will help reduce transmission within schools. Increasing the number of students who participate in school -based testing programs will increase the effecti veness and impact of these programs. To the extent practicable, LEAs should provide writt en information about COVID -19 testing incentives in a language that parents and guardians can und erstand. If it is not practicable to provide written translations to a parent or guardian with limited English proficiency, information about COVID -19 testing incentives should be orally translated for such parent or guardian. In addition, LEAs should prov ide the information using auxiliary aids and services and in an altern ative format accessible to a parent or guardian who is an individual with a disability un der Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Any incentives that an LEA provides with ESSER and Governor's Education Emergency Relief (GEER) funds must meet the requirements in 2 CFR Part 200, including the requirement that the amount of the incentiv e be reasonable and necessary, and any other applicable laws or requirements (e.g., incentives ma y not involve alcohol under 2 CFR \u00a7 200.423, may not violate applicabl e privacy and parental consent laws). For example, an LEA might provide a nominal gift ca rd or any other allowable incentive that is reasonable in size and scope and likely to lead to an increase in the rate of participation by providing the incentive to each family that opts in or chooses not to opt out of a school -based COVID -19 testing program. 44 Other than statutory and regulatory requirements includ ed in the document, the contents of this guidance do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies . 45 See: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/schools -childcare/k -12-guidance.html . 46 The Education Stabilization Fund includes Elementary and Sec ondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) and Governor's Emergency Education Relief (GEER) funds awarded under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (ESSER I and GEER I); the Coronavirus Response and Relief Appropriations (CRRSA) Act, 2021 (ESSER II and GEER II); and the ARP Act (ARP ESSER). 86 GEER I and GEER II funds may also support school -based COVID -19 screening testing efforts in State and local public pre -kindergarten programs that may include tes ting programs located in schools or community -based pre -kindergarten/early childhood educ ation settings. 87 Section 3: Student Transportation Use of Funds for Student Transportation Listed below are frequently asked questions (FAQs) about allowable uses of ESSER and GEER funds by State educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencie s (LEAs) for transportation, including to address the current regional and national challenges with hiring and retaining a sufficient number of school bus drivers. These FAQs are intended to supplement the transportation related questions in the ESSER and GEER Use of Funds Guidance published in May 2021, specifically FAQs C -4, C-7, C-9, and C -25. Other than statutory and regulatory requirements included in the document , the contents of this g uidance do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies. 1. May an SEA or LEA use ESSER or GEER funds to provide transportation for students to and from school? Yes. Supporting or providing transportation services for students is an allowable use of funds under ESSER and GEER as long as the need is related to COVID -19 (e.g., to s upport daily attendance at school to address the impact of lost instructional time) and t he cost is reasonable and necessary. This could include, but is not limited to, transportation services provided directly by the school district; the cost of public tr ansportation services (e .g., bus or subway fare); taxis, rideshare apps, or other driving services; or compensation to parents for providing transportation services for their children (see Question 4). 2. May an LEA use ESSER or GEER funds to provide transpor tation for students participating in after -school learning and enrichment activities prov ided by the LEA? Yes. If activities take place away from the school or after regular transportation home has occurred and are intended to address student needs related to COVID -19 (e.g., to address the impact of lost instructional time), and the cost is reasonable and necessary, transportation may be an allowable use of ESSER or GEER funds. For example, an LEA may provide before - and after-school learning and enrichment activities for students including, for example, high dosage evidence -based tutoring to a ddress the academic impact of lost instructional time, and other activities that address the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of students , includin g extended school year (ESY) or other compensatory and related services for eligible stud ents under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Reasonable and necessary costs of transportation to and from such activities would be an allowabl e use of E SSER and GEER funds. 88 3. May an SEA or LEA use ESSER or GEER funds to address a shortage of school bus drivers due to the pandemic? Yes. For example, an LEA may use ESSER or GEER funds for retention bonuses for current bus drivers, for salary increases, or f or the cost of hiring additional bus drivers to address the shortage of bus drivers due t o the pandemic. Similarly, if an LEA is operating more bus routes due to physical distancing, funds may be used to hire additional bus drivers. In addit ion, funds may be used to pay for the costs associated with obtaining a commercial driver's license for new bus drivers, including the required training. 4. May an LEA facing a shortage of school bus drivers use ESSER or GEER funds to compensate parents or guardians for transporting their students to and from school? Yes. ESSER or GEER funds may be used to rei mburse parents or guardians for transportation costs or to offer a stipend for transportation costs, as long as they are reasonable and nec essary. This type of program may be appropriate to sustain in -person instruction if an LEA is experiencing challenges hiring and/or retaining the school bus drivers necessary to accommodate the LEA's transportation needs. Before compensating parents or gua rdians for transportation co sts, an LEA must develop clear, objective procedures that, in addition to other relevant factors, consider: the number of days of transportation provided for in-person attendance; documentation of the travel costs to ensure that the compensation is used on ly for transportation -related expenses; and a process to account for any ESSER or GEER funds that were paid to parents or guardians but not used for transportation costs. 89 Section 4: Promoting Public Safety How American Rescue Plan Funds Can Prevent and Respond to Crime and Promote Public Safety The American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 in cludes nearly $122 billion in resources for State educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) through the ARP's Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund that can be used to address student needs resulting from and exacerbated by the pandemic. SEAs and LEAs may use these funds to return to and maximize in-person instructional time and address the social, emotional, mental health , and academic needs of students, including violence prevention and intervention in schoo ls. Previous rounds of ESSER relief funding included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Se curity (CARES) Act and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Suppleme ntal Appropriations (CRRSA) Act, 2021, as well as Governor's Emergency Education Relief ( GEER) funding, may also be used for this purpose.47 States and LEAs may use these funds, consistent with Federal civil rights laws, for a range of evidence - based strategies that increase public safety for young people. Young people \u2014especially Black and Brown young people \u2014are disproportionately injured and killed in acts of violence; gun violence, in par ticular, has risen since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pan demic began.48 Investing in violence prevention and intervention strategies is particularl y important given that so many students and their families have experienced trauma \u2014whether through the death of a loved one, hunger, loss of income, homelessness, soci al isolation, or other stressors \u2014over the course of the pandemic. This document complemen ts and should be read together with the Department's Frequently Asked Questions document on Elemen tary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Programs and Governor's Emergency Education Relief Programs, which provides more detailed information on the underl ying requirements related to uses of funds under the ESSER and GEER programs . The Administration urges SEAs and LEAs to consider using their Federal resources on strat egies to reduce violence and enhance public safety, as described below, to the benefit of their students, families, and communities, as part of their efforts to recover fr om the pandemic. 47 Other than statutory and regulatory requirements included in the document, such as those pursuant to the authorizing statute and other applicable laws and regulations, the contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public.

Washington, D.C.: Council on Criminal ARP ESSER and other ESSER and GEER funds be used to prevent and respond to violence and to increase public safety this summer and beyond? Within the parameters discussed below, ARP ESSER funds, as well as other ESSER and GEER funds, may be used to help students and disconnected youth49 through the followi ng public safety strategies: Community violence intervention (CVI) programs Summer and year-round programs that provide job training and work -based learning experience for students, including formerly incarcerated students, and disconnected youth who live in communities most impacted by high levels of violence Summer education and enrichment programs, including summer camp Wraparound services \u2014such as medical care, mental health and substance use disorder care, and nutrition support \u2014for students and their families, including hiring support personnel for schools such as nurses, school counselors , and social workers Establishing or expanding full-service community schools Reengaging students who became disconnected from school during the pandemic to help them transition to career or postsecondary education programs 1. Community Violence Intervention50 ESSER and GEER funds may be used to implement CVI strategies, which address students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic development and are especially i mportant in the context of the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pand emic on histor ically underserved groups of students (e.g., students from low-income families, students of color, students with disabilities, English learners, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, and children who are incarcerated). Purposeful strategies to re -engage disconnected youth through youth violence reduction programs, mentorship, and strengthening youth skills through wor kforce engagement and training also have the potential to r educe community violence. 49 As used in thi s document, the term \"disconnected youth\" means \"out -of-school youth\" as that term is def ined in the Carl D. Perki ns Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins V) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(35)). That section defines the term by reference to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 31 02, which in turn refers to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 3164, which provides the following definition in paragraph (a)(1)(B): The term \"out -of-school youth\" means an individual who is \u2014 (i) Not attending any school (as defined under State law); (ii) Not younger than age 16 or older than age 24; and (iii) One or more of the following: (I) A school dropout. (II) A youth who is within t he age of compulsory scho ol attendance, but has not attended school for at least the most recent complete school year calendar quarter. (III) A recipient of a secondary scho ol diploma or its recognized equivalent who is a low -income individual and is \u2014 (aa) Basic skills deficient; or (bb) An English language learner. (IV) An individual who is subject to the juvenile or adult justice system. (V) A homeless individual (as defined in sect ion 12473(6) of title 34), a homeless child or youth (as defined in section 11434a(2) of title 42), a runaway, in foster care or has [1] aged out of the foster care system, a child eligible for assistance under section 677 of title 42, or in an out -of-home placement. (VI) An individual who is pregnant or parenting. (VII) A youth who is an individual with a disability. (VIII) A low -income individual who requires additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment. 50 See ESSER and GEER Use of Funds FAQ C-24. 91 Examples of mentorship, counseling, and other relevant programs are described in Volume 2 of the Department's COVID -19 Handbook available the Administration's -Based Learning51 ESSER and GEER funds may be used f or summer and year -round work -based or service -learning programs for high school students as part of State and LEA efforts to engage students, including disconnected youth. This includes programs that provide workforce readiness training, apprenticeship or pre-apprenticeship opportunities, internships, skills development, placement services, and/or coaching and mentoring. Funds may be used both to support the training t hat high school students receive and to supplement the pay (e.g., by providing stipends) to students who participate in the summer and year - round work -based learning program. Funds may also be used to support service - learning or other volunteer opportunit ies for high school students, in cluding transportation and meals if not covered through U .S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs and flexibilities. Summer and year -round programs that provide stipends for training and/or work -based learning experienc es targeted primarily to student s who are formerly incarcerated or otherwise involved in the criminal or juvenile justice system, or who live in communities experiencing high levels of violence, may also be supported with ESSER and GEER funds. 3. Summer Enric hment Programs for Students52 ESSER and GEER funds may support summer learning and enrich ment programs. Ensuring young people are connected to education and communities of support is critical to violence prevention. Given that this summer affords students a critical opportunity to reconnect with their peers and engage in learning, LEAs should consider a variety of options for procuring summer opportunities with ESSER and GEER funds, including programs run by non -profit or community organizations as well as those run by the LEA. Effective summer programming can accelerate learning and address students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs through a combination of activities that include strong partnerships with community -based organizations an d other sum mer providers, including summer camps. These partnerships can help to sustain these programs and can also support programs in rural and remote communities. Consistent with the President's call for all communities to provide high -quality summer l earning and engagement opportunities for their students, communities should maximize enro llment in summer programs, with a particular focus on underserved students and students most impacted by the COVID - 19 pandemic, including providing transportation and meal servic es. Programs should target students of all ages, including high school student s, and can include work -based internships or service -learning opportunities and/or summer bridge programs to support successful educational transitions. LEAs should pa rticularly identify opportunities to re -engage students whose schools have not been succe ssful 51 See ESSER and GEER Use of Funds FAQ C-26. 52 See ESSER an d GEER Use of Funds FAQ C-25. 92 in engaging them during the COVID -19 pandemic, and to specifically address the needs of students with disabilities in this context. LEAs may use indicators such as chronic absenteeism (during in-person and/or remote instruction) to identify students in need of targeted support and services, as well as more generally identifying which students have lost the greatest number of in-person instructional days since the beginning of the COVID -19 pandemic. Moreover, an SEA must reserve at least 1 percent of i ts total ARP ESSER allocation for evidence -based summer enrichment programs, and LEAs must reserve at least 20 percent of their ARP ESSER funds to address the academic impact of lost instructional time53 through the implementation of evidence -based interven tions, which may include summer programs, particularly to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on historically underserved student subgroups. Evidence -based summer learning and enrichment programs are further described in Volume 2 of the Department's COVID GEER funds may be used to provide social, emotional, mental health, and academic supports to address the impacts of isolation during the pandemic, which may include, for example, supports to address students' behavioral, medical, and other needs related to substance use disorder. ESSER and GEER funds may also support broader a ctivities that re -engage disconnected youth and reduce community violence in places where the COVID -19 pandemic has exacerb ated inequities, leading to increases in the number of disconnected youth and incidents of violence. GEER funds may further be used t o fund social, emotional, and mental health support activities determined to be essential by the Governor of each State. Eligible uses of ESSER and GEER funds include: Hiring support personnel in schools such as nurses, school counselors, and social worker s. An LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds, including the 20 percent of ARP ESSER funds set aside to address the academic impac t of lost instructional time, to support students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs, including by implementing school -wide strategies that enhance supports and interventions for students as well as targeted assistance for students who n eed such supports. This includes hiring support personnel such as nurses, school counselo rs, social workers, and other support personnel, which could include individuals trained in violence intervention and trauma -informed care as well as individuals trained in responding to substance use disorder. Implementing or expanding arts programs, suc h as music programs, including by purchasing instruments; expanding sports programming so more students can participate; and initiating clubs, such as a robotic or STE M club. 53 For the purposes of this guidance document, the term \"academic impact of lost instructional time\" is used in place of \"learning loss\" experienced by students as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, as referenced in the ARP Ac t. 54 See ESSER and GEER Use of Funds FAQs C-3, C-4, and C-16. 93 Providing community -based mental health and substance use disorder programs to students and their families that deliver evidence -based psychotherapy, crisis support services, and/or recovery support. Ensuring that schools are implementing instr uctional practices that are culturally responsive and that incorporate trauma -informed pe dagogy in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. For example, LEAs with high concentrations of English learners may hire additional bilingual staff to address the social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs of English learners. ESSER and GEER funds may be used to support implementation of curriculum, including related professional development. Providing meals for students. Typically, an LEA has other means of prov iding for food services, such as through the USDA or other Federal programs. As a result, the Department encourages LEAs to use those Federal funds with the specific purpose of providing food services to students prior to using ESSER or GEER funds for this purpose. USDA has provided nationwide flexibilities and many flexibilities have been ext ended ARP Act expands the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P - EBT) program to any school year in which there is a public health emergency designation as well as during summer months. In implementing evidence -based strategies to address the academic impact of lost instruct ional time through the ARP ESSER required reservation of funds, SEAs and LEAs must respond to students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs and addres s the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on students from low -income famili es, students of color, English learners, students with disabilities, migratory students, students experi encing homelessness, and children and youth in foster care. Effective strategies to support student social, emotional, mental health, and academic devel opment are further described in Volume 2 of -19 Community Schools55 Community schools provide a range of services to students and their families, including through leveraging partnerships with non -profits and community -based org anizations, that are effective parts of comprehensive community violence prevention strategies. An LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to provide services and supports to students and fam ilies through evidence -based, full -service community schools. The ARP Ac t defines a full -service community school as it is defined in section 4622(2) of the Elem entary and Secondary Education Act, as amended: a public elementary school or secondary school that (A) participates in a community -based effort to coordinate and integrate educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services (which could include nutritional services) through community -based organizations and public and priva te partnerships; and (B) provides access to such services in school to s tudents, families, and the community, such as access during the school year (including be fore- and after -school hours and weekends), as well as during the 55 See ESSER and GEER Use of Funds FAQ C -13. 94 summer. Evidence -based commun ity school approaches include integrated student supports, active family and community engagement, expanded learning time opportunities, and collaborative leader ship and practices. Using ESSER or GEER funds to support full -service community schools can hel p support students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic devel opment. Additionally, LEAs may utilize funds in the development or expansion of in -school student support centers that provide mentoring, counseling, support for substance use disorders, and social and emotional learning supports to students in individual or group sessions. 6. Connecting Young People with Careers and Postsecondary Education Oppo rtunities56 ESSER and GEER funds may be used to support students who graduated high school or left school in 2020 and 2021 who have not yet successfully transitioned to college or careers. Consistent with the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, as amended by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V), an LEA may use ESSER and GEER funds to support former students who graduated high school in the class of 2020 or who will graduate in 2021 (i.e., during the pandemic) but have not yet successfully t ransitioned to college or careers. For example, consistent with the requirements of Perkins V, an LEA may prov ide postsecondary education counseling and related support services, including for associ ate and baccalaureate degree programs, financial literac y, summer bridge programs, and pre -apprenticeship or registered apprenticeship; assistance with college applica tions; career information, advising, and navigation supports; career exposure activities and career readiness preparation, including resume devel opment, employability skills training, mock interviews, and other readiness strategies; subsidized or unsubsidi zed summer or year -round work -based learning experiences, such as job shadows, internship s, and other job training programs; assistance with iden tifying, applying for, and entering job training programs; and subsidized job training and industry -recognized credential 56 See ESSER and GEER Use of Funds FAQ C -18. 95 Section 5: Use of Funds to Prevent, Prepare for, or Respond to COVID -19 Use of Funds to Prevent, Prepare for, and Respond to the COVID -19 Pandemic The below frequently asked question (FAQ) is about allowable uses of ESSER and GEER funds by State educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs). This FAQ is intended to supplement the questions in the ESSER and GEER use of funds guidance published in May 2021. ESSER and GEER funds offer schools and communities an opportunity to respond to the pandemic and ensure that our education system is even stronger than bef ore. The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is committed to continuing to support SEAs and LEAs in deploying these resources to respond with urgency to meet a w ide array of needs of the Nation's students. Other than statutory and regulatory requirem ents included in the document, the contents of this guidance do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agen cy policies. What does it mean for ESSER and GEER funds to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID -19 pandemic? ESSER and GEER funds are part of the Education Stabilization Fund established by Congress. The purpose of the Education Stabilization Fun d generally is to \"prevent, prepare for, and respond to\" COVID -19. As described in greater detail in the ESSER and GEER use of funds guidance , ESSER and GEER funds may be used for a wide range of activities, including: Supporting physical health and safety , such as developing strategies and implementing public health protocols including, to the greatest extent practicable, policies in line with guidanc e from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Meeting students' social, emotional, mental health, academic, and other needs; and Operational continuity and other allowed uses. In response to the pandemic, ESSER and GEER funds offer the opportunity to make educ ational systems better for students, educators, staff, schools, and their communities pos t-pandemic. The Department encourages SEAs and LEAs to think holistically about their response to COVID -19 in order to address the impact of lo st instructional time fr om the pandemic on all students and to address pre -existing challenges that, if left unad dressed, will impede recovery from the pandemic. As stated in the Overview of the ESSER and GEER use of funds guidance: \"These Federal emergenc y resources are availabl e for a wide range of activities to address diverse needs arising from or exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic, or to emerge stronger post-pandemic , including responding to students' social, emotional, mental health, and academic needs and continuing to pr ovide educational services as States, LEAs, and schools respond to and recover from the p andemic\" [emphasis added]. 96 For example, the Department has advised that allowable approaches to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the pandemic could include, but are not limited to, the following activities: Addressing students' social, emotional, men tal health, and academic needs, including addressing inequities that were worsened by the pandemic, through activities such as provi ding mental health services and sup ports to students (including those who experienced trauma before the pandemic), programs to re-engage students (including addressing factors that contributed to student disengagement before the pandemic), continuing to address issues of digital equity and access, and implementing rigorous curricula across P -12 schools. Ensuring that students have access to the teachers and other critical staff they need to support their success by hiring additional educators and school staff and improving compensation to recruit and retain educators and school staff. Sustaining and expanding existing summer learning and enrichment programming or early childhood education programs. Creating or improving existing data systems and collection to identify and respond in a timely manner to student needs in light of the pandemic. Supporting the needs of children with disabilities, including infants and toddlers with disabilities and children with disabilities who are English learners, under the Individuals with Disabilities Educatio n Act, such as by eliminating evaluation backlogs and providing support and direct servic es for children with disabilities, including technical assistance, personnel preparation, and professional development and training. Providing educational and related services to students with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 197 3 who are not eligible for services under IDEA but receive services in accordanc e with a 504 plan. This includes, but is not limited to, providing additional instructi on and services to students with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act , often referred to as compensatory services, to make up for any skills that mig ht have been lost if it is individually determined that the student was unable to recei ve a free appropriate education as a result of the closure of school buildings or other disruption in services as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Maintaining healthy facilities, which could include addressing pre-existing or new ventilation, roofing, an d plumbing needs, or other needs that may inhibit healthy learning environments during fu ll-time in -person learning. This might include roof repairs or replacement; red ucing lead exposure in water; or mold, radon, and asbestos remediation, as well as facil ity updates (such as upgrading science labs) to address the impact of lost instructional time.
