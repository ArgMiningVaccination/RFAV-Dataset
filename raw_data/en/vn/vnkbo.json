{"title": "Policies \u2014 Acupuncture & Massage Therapy in St. Louis Park, MN \u2014 Function: Massage & Acupuncture", "author": null, "url": "https://www.functionmn.com/policies", "hostname": "functionmn.com", "description": null, "sitename": "Function: Massage & Acupuncture", "date": "2022-02-01", "cleaned_text": "Policies Cancellation Policy Appointments may be canceled up to 24 hours before your scheduled visit. Late cancellations and missed appointments directly impact our small team, as the time saved for your visit was unable to be offered to or utilized by others. We reserve the right to impose a fee ranging from 60% for late cancellations to a full-service fee for last-minute cancellations or missed appointments. Please note Function maintains a policy of rarely closing due to weather. If you are unsure about traveling in hazardous conditions, we recommend watching the forecast and rescheduling for a new date prior to the 24-hour cancellation window. Mask Policy Masks are optional for guests and staff. Our practitioners are happy to wear a mask during treatment, upon request. Vaccination Policy It is our policy to not ask or disclose the vaccination status of any person. Our Commitment We engage in and will always maintain extensive adherence to sensible and proven spread prevention practices. Most importantly we commit to ensuring our staff will be responsible and stay home if they feel unwell in any way - the most practical and reasonable way to keep our community healthy. Please do the same for us and our business. Informed Consent I understand that methods of treatment may include, but are not limited to, massage therapy, acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, electrical stimulation, percussive therapy, herbal medicine, and nutritional counseling. I will immediately notify a member of the clinical staff of any unanticipated or unpleasant effects associated with any of these related treatments. I understand that while this document describes the major risks of treatment, other side effects and risks may occur. I understand that some herbs may be inappropriate during pregnancy. I will notify a clinical staff member who is caring for me if I am or become pregnant. While I do not expect the clinical staff to be able to anticipate and explain all possible risks and complications of treatment, I wish to rely on the clinical staff to exercise professional judgment during the course of treatment based upon the facts known and which are in my best interest. I understand that results are not guaranteed. Acupuncture Informed Consent I hereby request and consent to the performance of acupuncture treatments and other procedures within the scope of the practice of acupuncture on me (or on my child/dependent) by the acupuncturist and/or licensed practitioners who now and in the future treat me in their capacity as a Function staff practitioner. I have been informed that acupuncture is a generally safe method of treatment, but that it may have some side effects, including bruising, numbness, or tingling near the needling sites that may last a few days, and dizziness or fainting. Burns and/or scarring are a potential risk of moxibustion and cupping, or when treatment involves the use of heat lamps. Bruising is a common side effect of cupping. Extremely unusual risks of acupuncture include spontaneous miscarriage, nerve damage, and organ puncture, including lung puncture (pneumothorax). While these risks are inherently possible, our staff is highly qualified and adequately trained in using techniques to avoid these complications. Infection is another possible risk - our clinic only uses sterile single-use disposable needles and acupuncture staff are clean needle technique certified in a safe, clinical treatment environment. Massage Informed Consent I have read and understood the disclosures, policies, and procedures of Function LLC, and I would like to receive a massage session or request a session for my child or dependent. I understand the benefits and limits of massage therapy and understand massage may cause adverse reactions in certain situations. If I experience any discomfort during the session, I will immediately inform my therapist so they can modify the massage strokes. I understand massage therapists do not diagnose diseases or conditions, prescribe medications or treatments, or perform spinal adjustments. I recognize massage is not a substitute for medical treatment and should I need medical treatment, I will seek out the appropriate healthcare professional (physician, psychotherapist, chiropractor, etc). I understand that it is my responsibility to keep the massage therapist informed of changes in my (or my child's / dependent's) health status, diagnosed medical conditions, and medication. I understand that failure to inform the therapist of these changes may place me (or my child/dependent) at greater risk of adverse reactions to massage. I release the massage therapist of any liability if I fail to disclose the appropriate health-related information. Privacy Policy I understand the Function clinical and administrative staff may review my patient record only as needed for treatment and billing, but all my records will be kept confidential and will not be released without my written consent.
