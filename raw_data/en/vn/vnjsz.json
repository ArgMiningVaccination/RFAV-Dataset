These prestigious positions honor our most accomplished physician- and nurse-scientists and clinicians. They celebrate those who demonstrate extraordinary achievement in advancing scholarship, science, and human health. And perhaps most importantly, they nurture innovation, discovery, and the expansion of the boundaries of knowledge. As we seek to shape the future of health and health care at Duke Health, we are making endowed professorships a foundational priority. Philanthropic efforts to establish endowed professorships are gifts that last forever. Once inaugurated, they continue in perpetuity, passing in time from one exceptional faculty member to the next. Every endowed professorship is both a profound honor for the faculty member who holds it and a meaningful legacy to the visionary benefactor who establishes it. That legacy is evident in the pages that follow, as we profile our philanthropic partners who have generously invested in endowed professorships at Duke Health. They have demonstrated their commitment by empowering our acclaimed faculty, our sharpest minds, and most visionary researchers and educators to take on the most pressing health challenges and pursue promising scientific opportunities here and around the world. Great universities succeed on the strength of the partnerships they form with their supporters and benefactors. Everyone who establishes an endowed professorship at Duke Health joins with us in our mission to deliver tomorrow's health care today, accelerate research and its translation, and create education that is transforming. We are deeply grateful for these partners, who, as you will read, have propelled our professors and our institution to even greater heights of excellence and impact.

Klotman, MD Dean, Duke University School of Medicine Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs, Duke University Robert J. Lefkowitz , MD James B. Duke Professor of Medicine Awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for ChemistryRobert J. Lefkowitz, MD, was on track to spend his career as a clinical physician when the call of the laboratory became too insistent to resist. After his first six months as a senior resident at Massachusetts General Hospital, he broke from the customary path and returned to research, which he had gotten a taste for during two years at the National Institutes of Health. While he has spent the majority of his 45-year professional career in the lab at Duke, he continued to make clinical teaching rounds for decades and still holds an active medical license. His research on cell surface receptors earned him the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the first ever awarded to a Duke faculty member. Lefkowitz won the Nobel Prize for his seminal discoveries on G protein-coupled receptors, which detect a huge variety of stimuli outside the cell membrane and transmit signals to a G protein inside it, allowing the cell to respond appropriately. Because this process is involved in numerous diseases, G protein-coupled receptors are a target for more than a third of all modern pharmaceutical drugs. In addition to his research, Lefkowitz is renowned as a mentor. More than 200 graduate students and post-docs\u2014including Brian Kobilka, now at Stanford, with whom he shared the Nobel Prize\u2014have learned under Lefkowitz's tutelage. And they still do, as he continues to explore the secrets of receptors because, as he once said, in science \"there's always a new detail to discover. It's like peeling an onion.\" Nobel Laureates6 DUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPS DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINESee page 39 for Lefkowitz's professional profile.7 DUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPS DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINEPaul L. Modrich , PhD James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry Awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize for ChemistryRobert J. Lefkowitz , MD James B. Duke Professor of Medicine Awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for ChemistryWhen Paul L. Modrich, PhD, was growing up in New Mexico, his father, a local high school biology teacher, told him, \"You should learn about this DNA stuff, because it's really interesting.\" Rarely has a father's advice been so thoroughly embraced: Modrich has spent his entire career studying \"this DNA stuff,\" and he's done it so exceptionally that in 2015 he was one of three researchers to share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Modrich came to Duke in 1976 from the University of California at Berkeley and says he felt at home right away in a small department with an exceptional and collegial faculty. He carried on his research and won the Nobel Prize for some four decades of investigation into how cells repair errors that occur in DNA as chromosomes replicate. Errors in the genetic code frequently transpire during replication within the body's 10 trillion cells. These errors are recognized and corrected by mismatch repair (MMR), and Modrich showed how this works. His basic science research turned out to have significant implications for human health, as Modrich and others showed that defects in the MMR system are the cause of one of the most common forms of hereditary cancer and play a central role in the development of certain sporadic tumors as well. \"Science moves in little steps,\" Modrich says, \"and you don't always know where you'll end up when you set out.\" See page 34 for Modrich's professional profile.

DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPSthe Ruth K. Broad Biomedical Research Foundation, Inc., from its inception in 1988 until his death in 2016. The Foundation honors the memory of Ruth K. Broad, Morris Broad's mother, and aims to expand knowledge to understand the causes of Alzheimer's disease and work toward a cure by funding research in the neurosciences. In the early 1990s, the Foundation became a support corporation of Duke University. It is managed through the office of Duke Health Development and Alumni Affairs, and the board of directors is made up of Broad family members, physicians and scientists, and Duke advisors. When Morris passed away, the directors of the Ruth K. Broad Foundation felt strongly that there should be a lasting tribute to him at Duke to honor his dedication to fighting Alzheimer's disease. As such, the Broad professorship was endowed with assets from the Ruth K. Broad Foundation. Additionally, Morris's sister, Ann Bussel, and Ann's children, Deborah Bussel, Karen Berman, John Bussel, and Dan Bussel, directed a gift from the Shepard Broad Foundation to Duke to help co-create the professorship. The Shepard Broad Foundation, of which Morris Broad was chairman for many years, was created by Morris and Ann's father, Shepard Broad, and has provided philanthropic support to hospitals, universities, and other charities throughout Florida and elsewhere. \"The combined efforts of the Ruth K. Broad Foundation and the Shepard Broad Foundation to provide support for an exceptional neuroscience researcher at Duke would have pleased my brother greatly,\" says Morris's sister Ann Bussel. \"He was a wonderful brother, and I'm so glad we could do this for him.\"HONORING A LIFE OF SERVICE The Morris N.

A key facet of her research program centers on inventing powerful methods to identify and perturb these neural circuits. Wang exploited a molecular system that she developed for retrograde trans-synaptic transport of markers to create remarkable sensorimotor circuit diagrams. She also revealed a dual amino-acid and opioid-peptide transmitter descending system that plays critical anti-pain functions in the spinal cord and, using a system she invented called CANE (Capturing Activated Neural Ensembles), discovered a unique neural connection underlying heightened emotional responses to head and face pain. Wang is also using CANE to reveal how the brain controls the conscious versus unconscious state.Fan Wang DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPSW.

Chen and his wife, Alice, have generously supported medical genetics research in the Department of Pediatrics with gifts including a professorship, an associate professorship, a fellowship, and an endowment to launch and operate the Y.T. and Alice Chen Pediatric Genetics and Genomics Research Center at Duke. \"Pompe disease is what is called an 'orphan disease,' one that affects fewer than 200,000 people worldwide,\" says Chen. \"In some ways, pediatrics is like an orphan department. While you find many endowed professorships in other departments at medical schools, there are very few in pediatrics. So I thought it was very important to establish one in pediatrics at Duke, especially in the medical genetics division.\" In 2011, the Chens marked his parents' 70th wedding anniversary by renaming the professorship in their honor. Their connection to Duke, initiated by Chen's father, is strong and lasting: both of their sons\u2014 Jerome, T'99, MHS'10, and Gerald, T'03, L'11\u2014graduated from Duke. And there are signs that more Chens may follow the same path; when their first granddaughter, Olivia, was born, then-President Richard A. Brodhead sent a letter congratulating them and welcoming Olivia to \"the Class of 2033.\" \"We now have three generations with links to Duke, and the fourth may be on the way,\" Chen says. \"So with all those connections, when we started to think about how we could give back, this was the first place we thought about.\" Priya S.

His research seeks to understand the role of the genes responsible for these genetic syndromes and the pathology of these disorders. The first step in Marchuk's approach is to identify the genetic loci underlying these disorders, providing the basis for molecular biological studies on the role of the mutant protein in the disease pathology and on the role of normal proteins in vascular development. Subsequent investigations require an in vivo model, usually a genetically modified mouse, which serves as a more tractable system to facilitate understanding of the biology of the gene product in vascular morphogenesis.

We knew that Duke would put our support to the most productive and beneficial use.\" FRANCES FOSTERWHERE THE HEART IS C. Stephen Foster, T'65, MD'69, HS'70, spent 10 years at Duke. So much time that his West Virginia grandmother started joking with her quilting group that she worried Foster was a slow learner. In reality, he was anything but. He began his decade at Duke in 1960 as an undergraduate, then earned a medical degree and completed training in internal medicine, starting on a career path that eventually led him into the field of ocular immunology. Stephen and Frances FosterDUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPS48 DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINEAbout the DonorsFoster, who now runs his own practice, The Massachusetts Eye Research and Surgery Institution, was on the faculty at Harvard for many years. But when it came time to think about philanthropy, his wife, Frances, who is a former ocular patient, told him, \"Your heart is at Duke.\" The couple created an endowed professorship at Duke and have also launched and endowed a Center for Ocular Immunology, which will be directed by the Stephen and Frances Foster Professor. \"This will be a unique academic center that can make advances with potentially blinding inflammatory disease,\" Foster says. Stephen Foster credits his Duke training with helping to inspire his career. During his Duke training in internal medicine, he had a lunch conversation with a colleague about the scarcity of work in the ocular immunology field. The conversation sparked Foster's ongoing fascination with immune responses in the eye. But the field of ocular immunology is not just of academic interest to the Fosters. When Frances Foster was a child, she lost the sight in one eye because of uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye). The couple wanted to prevent such a loss for others. \"The research done at Duke is among the best in the world. We knew that Duke would put our support to the most productive and beneficial use,\" Frances says.

Margaret was beginning preparations for a bone-marrow transplant when she passed away. 64 DUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPS DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Mattye and Marc Silverman William and Gigi HarrisAbout the DonorsMattye and Marc Silverman's son David was diagnosed with glioblastoma while he was working his first job after graduating with Bachelor's and Master in Accounting degrees from UNC-Chapel Hill. Initially, doctors told him he had six months to live. Under the care of Henry Friedman, MD, David lived two years. \"Henry and David connected unbelievably,\" Mattye Silverman says. \"Henry would come in and just sit down on the floor and start talking to David, as friends.\" \"When one drug didn't work, they would try another one. It was a grueling and debilitating treatment, but Henry and the nurses were so wonderful. It was as good a treatment as David could have received anywhere,\" Mattye Silverman says. The couples decided to turn their shared bond into something positive\u2014raising funds to help prevent what happened to them from happening to others. \"After Margaret died, we had all these friends with energy who wanted to do something,\" Gigi Harris says. After attending Duke Forest 5K (an early version of the race that is now Angels Among Us, which raises money for brain cancer research at Duke), \"We said, 'We could do this in Charlotte,'\" she says. The couple teamed up with the Silvermans and launched the annual Hope Builders 5K to raise money for brain cancer research at Duke. They and their friends accomplished every task needed to organize the race themselves, including having T-shirts made and equipping and manning water stations. \"It's not easy to fundraise for Duke in Charlotte,\" Mattye Silverman says. \"Marc and I called in every chit we had.\" The first year, the race raised more than $50,000. After several years of the race, the four friends realized that they had raised almost enough to endow a professorship. \"I remember Ellen Stainback from the brain tumor center and Dr. Darrell Bigner saying, 'You can really do this,'\" says Gigi Harris. In 2004, Francis Ali-Osman, PhD, became the holder of the Margaret Harris and David Silverman Professorship in Neuro-Oncology Research. He keeps photos of David Silverman and Margaret Harris on his desk. \"We just felt like we had to give back, so other people would have the opportunity to get the treatment that we received and hopefully someday be able to help find not only far better treatments, but also real cures,\" Marc Silverman says. Adds Mattye Silverman, \"After serving on the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Board for 25 years, we have seen so many amazing advances such as the new poliovirus or other new treatments, we can foresee something that in 1997 we would have thought was not possible in our lifetime: that a brain tumor might just be a chronic disease that doesn't kill people. Maybe something that Duke is doing with the funds we gave to the endowment can help to keep other parents from losing wonderful children.\" The Margaret Harris and David Silverman Professor of Neuro-Oncology Research is vacant. The School of Medicine looks forward to filling this professorship in the near future.65 DUKE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DUKE HEALTH NAMED PROFESSORSHIPSMary and Deryl Hart Professor of SurgeryGIVEN BY DERYL AND MARY HART, FRIENDS OF DR.
