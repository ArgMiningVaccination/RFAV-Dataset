Leptospirosis is caused by a bacteria contracted from contaminated water or through the waste of an infected animal. If a dog has the bacteria, he can spread it to humans. Learn how to prevent leptospirosis so you can keep you and your dog safe. Steps Preventing Leptospirosis - 1Limit your dog's exposure to high-risk environments. The bulk of leptospirosis prevention focuses on limiting your dog's exposure to the environments where leptospirosis is likely to be lurking. Leptospirosis is often transmitted through stagnant bodies of water where infected wild animals have urinated or defecated. [[1]](#_note-1)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Keep your dog on a leash when walking or hiking in high risk areas, like marshy land or around stagnant ponds so that he doesn't drink standing water. Don't allow your dog to drink or swim in standing water. When your dog is outside, provide fresh clean water and change his water regularly to prevent his drinking water from becoming infected. - You should also keep your dog away from raw sewage. - Keep your dog away from other dog's feces and urine when you take him for a walk. - Separate infected dogs from healthy dogs as well. [[2]](#_note-2)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - 2Get your dog vaccinated. Vaccinations are available that protect against the common leptospirosis strands. [[3]](#_note-3)X Research source [The initial vaccination is given to healthy dogs 10 weeks of age or older followed by a booster three to four weeks later.](#) [[4]](#_note-4)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)American Kennel Club is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. [Go to source](#) - The vaccination lasts for a year and should be boosted each year. - These vaccines are only effective for the forms of leptospirosis which are more commonly found to cause disease symptoms in dogs. For the most part this will be adequate for the average dog. - Vaccinations do not work immediately after the first vaccine. After the booster vaccine the dog will then have full protection against leptospirosis. - 3Remove anything that attracts vermin. Another way to prevent leptospirosis is to remove or fix situations that might attract vermin to your property. Animals such as raccoons, skunks, opossums, and rodents can carry leptospirosis. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Drain any stagnant water on your property. Stagnant water attracts vermin. - Keep garbage cans covered so these animals won't be tempted to search for food in the garbage can. - Monitor bird feeders so they don't attract these pests to your yard. - Trap any bothersome creatures with a live trap and release far away from your home or consult an animal exterminator if you cannot get rid of them. - 4Isolate infected dogs. If your dog comes down with leptospirosis, you will need to keep in mind that he can spread leptospirosis to you or other animals. Put your infected dog in a separate room or area than other dogs. - Make sure your other pets or family members don't come in contact with the infected dog's waste. - If you have to handle the infected dog, make sure to wear gloves at all times. Wash your hands after coming in contact with the dog. - 5Disinfect any contaminated areas. Dogs may pick up the bacteria from areas that haven't been disinfected. Properly cleaning any bodily fluids your pet sheds while infected can help reduce the risk of the bacteria spreading to other dogs. Advertisement - Be careful when handling your dog's waste. Use gloves to pick up any stool. Make sure the dog only uses the bathroom in a spot that can be cleaned, like concrete. Don't let the dog use the bathroom on the ground or dirt because the bacteria can soak into the ground and spread. - Most common household disinfectants will kill the leptospirosis germ, so bleach or other disinfectants can be used to clean the bathroom area, dog kennel, and water and food bowls. - Make sure to wash your hands well after touching the infected dog or his waste. Recognizing The Symptoms of Leptospirosis - 1Check for stomach issues. If your dog has leptospirosis, he may exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms. He may suddenly have a decreased appetite and refuse to eat like he did before. [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source - Your dog may also start vomiting or have diarrhea. - 2Monitor for urinary changes. Leptospirosis may also affect your dog's urinary tract. Pay attention to any changes in your dog's bathroom habits. He may exhibit increased thirst, which may lead to him urinating more. This means he may need to go out more or start having accidents in the house. [[7]](#_note-7)X Research source - Your dog may also experience dehydration. - Leptospirosis may lead to kidney failure. If this happens, you may find blood in your dog's urine. - 3Watch for unusual bleeding. The condition may cause bleeding disorders or abnormal bleeding in your dog. Look for any bleeding from abnormal places, like a nosebleed. Look for any blood on the skin or gums. [[8]](#_note-8)X Research source - If your dog vomits, check it for any blood. Check your dog's stool for any blood. - Your female dog may have a bloody discharge from her vaginal area. - 4Look for lung problems. Your dog may exhibit lung problems. This includes difficulty breathing, so watch for your dog to start wheezing or struggling to get air. He may also start panting or breathing heavily when he shouldn't be. - Your dog may also start coughing more. - 5Check for muscle aches. Muscle aches can be a symptom for leptospirosis. Watch your dog when he moves and notice any limping or favoring of limbs. Notice if he is whimpering or whining when he moves or when you touch him. Look for any negative reactions when you pet him. [[9]](#_note-9)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - If your dog feels pain or tenderness in his muscles, he may not want to move. This means he may lay around more and not be as active as he was before. - 6Check for other general symptoms. Leptospirosis may cause other general symptoms that may be connected to other conditions. These symptoms include fever and eye inflammation. - Your dog may also seem depressed or weak. - Leptospirosis may also cause liver problems, like jaundice, but may even cause liver failure. - 7Monitor for symptoms in humans. Leptospirosis can affect humans as well as dogs. Some people infected with the bacteria may have no symptoms, while others have more obvious signs. It can take two days to a month for a person to become sick after being exposed to the bacteria. [[10]](#_note-10)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) Advertisement - The initial symptoms usually include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Untreated, the illness can result in kidney or liver failure or meningitis. - A person can be sick for a few days or up to a month. Recovery can take several months without proper treatment. Understanding Leptospirosis - 1Diagnose leptospirosis. There is no specific way to diagnose leptospirosis because there are so many variations of the disease. Diagnosis is done on suspicion of the disease. For example, the vet will consider the geographical area and the exposure of the dog to likely contaminated environments. The vet will also consider the dog's symptoms. - A dog with a fever of unknown origin, with acute kidney or liver failure, and likely exposure should be suspected of having leptospirosis. - There are blood tests that can be done to check for a few variations, but these are not commonly available in the veterinary clinic. Blood test results may show signs of infection or kidney or liver damage. Urine testing may also show kidney damage or infection. - 2Treat the condition. Treatment is usually supportive care and antibiotics. Supportive care can include IV fluids to help with kidney or liver damage or to rehydrate a dog that is vomiting or having diarrhea. Anti-vomiting medication and medication to control diarrhea can also be used. - The most commonly used antibiotic is doxycycline, which is used for at least two weeks. Only your veterinarian can prescribe antibiotics. [[11]](#_note-11)X Research source - The most commonly used antibiotic is doxycycline, which is used for at least two weeks.

[[12]](#_note-12)X Research source [There are a number of varieties of leptospirosis, and which one your dog may be exposed to depends upon your geographical location.](#) [[13]](#_note-13)X Research source [The bacteria travel via the bloodstream and lymphatic system throughout the body. They grow until the body's immune system fights them.](#) [[14]](#_note-14)X Research source - If the body is unable to fight the bacteria, the bacteria will replicate in many body organs for three to 20 days before circulating in the blood. Eventually, the spirochetes are excreted from the body via the urine to be spread to other animals, including dogs and possibly humans. - 4Know how leptospirosis is spread. The disease is most common in warm climates with high annual rainfall and in rural areas where dogs are more likely to come into contact with wildlife and livestock which have contaminated the environment and water with their urine. [[15]](#_note-15)X Research source [Dogs can also contract it in urban areas with heavy rat populations or by coming in contact with raw sewage in an urban environment.](#) Advertisement - Dogs become infected by either drinking contaminated water or by the spirochetes entering the body through mucous membranes, cuts, or abrasions. - Bites from an infected animal or consuming flesh of infected animals can also spread this disease. - Children are at the highest risk for humans to contract leptospirosis from their pets.

In addition to vaccinating your dog, you should keep it away from high-risk areas such as raw sewage or standing water where wild animals might have urinated or defecated. To tell if your dog has been infected, look for stomach issues like vomiting, diarrhea, or sudden decrease in appetite, as well as unusual urination, bleeding, muscle aches, and lung problems. If your dog does become infected, keep it in a separate room away from other dogs and family members, and disinfect any contaminated areas. As soon as possible, take your dog to the vet to be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics.
