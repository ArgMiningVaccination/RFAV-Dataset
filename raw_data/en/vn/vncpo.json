Students are reminded to submit proof of (10-day measles), rubella (German measles), mumps, meningitis, diphtheria and tetanus to the PUSH immunization portal prior to completing your Purdue 101 online orientation program. If you do not submit proof of immunization, a hold will be placed on your account and you will be unable to register for classes. To comply with immunization requirements, you must complete the medical clearances section in your [Patient Portal](https://myhealth.push.purdue.edu/). Log into the portal, look for the \"Medical Clearances\" tab on the left and update any items marked \"Non Compliant\" by submitting documentation. Further instructions [ can be found here](https://www.purdue.edu/push/immunization/files/Visual%20Immunization%20Submission%20Process.pdf). If you need a tuberculosis test or vaccines that cannot be completed at home, they may be completed at PUSH as soon as you arrive to campus. If you need to receive a particular vaccine, [ please make an appointment with PUSH](https://www.purdue.edu/push/appointments/index.html) or another local pharmacy. Indiana state law requires all new, regularly enrolled students attending residential campuses of Indiana public universities be immunized against Rubeola (10 day measles), Rubella (German measles), Mumps, Meningitis, Diphtheria, and Tetanus. This law requires the university to block the enrollment of any student who does not comply with immunization requirements. If your record is held for immunization noncompliance, registration for future courses cannot be completed until all requirements have been met. Immunization proof must be legible, in English, and include the student's name. Students may upload their official immunization record OR a completed [immunization information form](files/Immunization History Form.2022.pdf) signed by an MD, DO, NP, or RN. The official immunization record does not need to be signed by a provider. |Vaccine||Requirement| |Rubeola (Measles, MMR)||2 doses of live vaccine administered after first birthday and at least 28 days apart.| |Rubella (MMR)||2 doses of live vaccine administered after first birthday and at least 28 days apart.| |Mumps (MMR)||2 doses of live vaccine administered after first birthday and at least 28 days apart.| |Tetanus Diphtheria (Td or Tdap)||No more than 10 years before starting classes.| |Meningitis (Men Quad/Conjugate, MCV4)||One dose on or after 16th birthday, if 23 years or younger.| |Meningococcal B (Separate from Meningitis)||2 doses of the same brand (Bexsero or Trumenba), if 23 or younger.| | | International students only |Tuberculosis Clearance||International students must have a QFT (Quantiferon blood test) or T-Spot (not PPD) with a negative result. This test must be completed in the United States and no more than 3 months before classes start. Test must be completed on the same date, or at least 28 days after any live vaccine. Those with an abnormal TB test result, will have additional steps to complete. Students not in compliance will not be able to register for future courses until the requirement has been met. | State-required immunizations are available at the Student Health Center and through other healthcare providers. Purdue requires 2 doses of the Meningitis B vaccine for all incoming students under the age of 24. College students are at an increased risk of being infected with the rare, but serious disease. Please click [here to access our Meningitis B fact sheet](files/men b update.pdf). No. Meningococcal B is a separate vaccine. MCV4 protects against variants A,C,W, and Y. Meningococcal B protects from the B variant. The brand names for Meningococcal B are Bexsero and Trumenba. No, this is only required for students under 24 when classes start. Yes. If you have started the vaccine but are unable to complete the 2nd dose because of the dosing schedule (28 days or 6 months between vaccines), PUSH staff will give you more time to complete the series when we review your submission. No, the TB test is only required for international students. No, Indiana law requires that the TB test be completed in the United States. Before classes start, all incoming students see the same items in medical clearances. Once classes start, students will be placed in their final populations and the requirements will correctly reflect the student's status. The TB test requirement is listed so that those that are required to complete this have a location to submit. Purdue will only accept a TB blood test meaning that your blood must be drawn by a lab. The TB skin test (PPD/Mantoux) are not acceptable. No. If you are submitting your immunization record, no hand-written signature is required. This is only required on the immunization history form. Additional records will be added using the green update box next to the immunization proof line in Medical Clearances. This is the same location records were originally submitted. Even though it states compliant now, the student can continue to submit additional records as needed. Yes. Your submission cannot be reviewed until proof is submitted and immunization dates have been entered. The review process can take up to 10 days to review. If there are any problems with the student's submission, PUSH staff will send the student a secure message. Grad students do not have access to the patient portal until classes start. Please hold on to your record until then and submit once portal access is available. If you are an undergrad and cannot login to the portal, please contact us at [shc@purdue.edu](mailto:shc@purdue.edu). Students who took previous classes through Purdue, either on campus or as an online student, will be considered \"former students\" until classes start. Once classes start, the student's population will correct itself and they will be able to enter immunization dates. If you'd like to submit immunization dates before classes start, please email [shc@purdue.edu](mailto:shc@purdue.edu). In the event of an outbreak of any of the vaccine preventable diseases covered by this law on or near campus, students holding exemptions will be excluded from all campus activities, for their protection, until the outbreak is declared to be over. Students, or their parent/guardian if the student is a minor, will write a statement indicating the reason that they cannot obtain immunizations. The statement must be hand-signed and dated. Once reviewed, the student will find the response in the letters section of their patient portal. A medical exemption will be granted upon receipt of a written statement from a healthcare provider indicating the nature and duration of the medical condition which contraindicates an immunization, as well as the specific vaccine identified as detrimental to the student's health or certifying pregnancy or suspected pregnancy. Medical exemptions expire when the medical condition(s) contraindicating immunization change in a manner which permits immunization.
