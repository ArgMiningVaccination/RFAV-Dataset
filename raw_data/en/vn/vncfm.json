[Heartburn](https://www.healthline.com/symptom/heartburn) is a symptom of acid reflux and GERD.\" According to Ayurveda, what's behind heartburn, acid reflux, and GERD is Pitta dosha, but first we'll peel apart all three. Next, we'll look at ways Ayurveda may help cool Pitta and ground Vata. Heartburn This mild to severely painful sensation felt is felt in the esophagus. The esophageal tissue is more delicate than the stomach which is designed to tolerate stomach acids. When stomach acids flow the wrong direction (Vata dosha at work here), the acid causes pain. Acid is the Pitta aspect, and the wrong directional flow of the acid is Vata. So this is a dual dosha imbalance. According to Ayurveda, the more doshas that are involved, the more serious the condition may be. True to [Pitta's](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/meet-the-saumya-pack) characteristics, the sensation of heartburn is sharp, pressured and burning.

According to [Healthline,](https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/heartburn-vs-acid-reflux) \"Heartburn usually occurs after eating. Bending over or lying down can make it feel worse. Heartburn is quite common. It is estimated that more than [60 million](http://patients.gi.org/topics/acid-reflux/) Americans experience heartburn at least once a month. ....Your heartburn may be a symptom of a more severe problem like acid reflux or GERD.\" Acid Reflux There's a sphincter muscle (circular, think something like a rubber band) between the stomach and esophagus. It tightens as food passes to the stomach. Sometimes that muscle doesn't do its job and stomach acid (Pitta) flows the wrong direction (Vata) back up into the esophagus. Acid reflux can cause heartburn and other Pitta symptoms that include: cough sore throat, hoarse voice bitter taste in the back of the throat sour taste in the mouth burning and pressure that can extend up the breastbone GERD Put simple, GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease....is chronic acid reflux. According to [Healthline,](https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/heartburn-vs-acid-reflux) \"It's diagnosed when acid reflux occurs more than twice a week or causes inflammation in the esophagus. Long-term damage of the esophagus can lead to cancer. Acid from the stomach can damage the lining of the esophagus if GERD is left untreated. This can cause bleeding, [ulcer](https://www.healthline.com/health/stomach-ulcer), and scarring.\" Symptoms of GERD include: bad breath [damage to tooth enamel](https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/damage-reversible)due to excess acid heartburn feeling like stomach contents have come back up to the throat or mouth, or regurgitation chest pain persistent dry cough Now, let's look at this through the magnified Pitta lens of Pitta, specifically Pachaka Pitta that resides in and governs the stomach and digestion. From an Ayurvedic perspective, these digestive conditions involve both Pitta (acid, heat) and Vata (movement upward, the wrong direction). GERD treatment, acid reflux treatment, heartburn treatent--it all hurts and Pitta is screaming at us for healing. Let's take a closer look at one of the sub-doshas of PItta, pachaka pitta, to expand our understanding of what's going on. Pachaka Pitta: Stomach & Digestion Pachaka Pitta governs digestion from within the small intestine. In Ayurveda, digestion is considered the bedrock of our health. Plus, Pitta dosha is deeply associated with agni, our digestive fire. Thus, Pachaka Pitta has a profound influence on all other forms of Pitta. Pachaka Pitta enables proper digestion and absorption of the foods that nourish our entire being. As Pachaka Pitta is a foundational subdosha, Pitta imbalances are often first observed as digestive issues. There comes a day if Pachaka Pitta begins to aggravate, that we may notice, or not, a general sense of heat in our belly, we may pass it off as something we ate or drank. Left unchecked, Pitta dosha continues to aggravate in the lower stomach and small intestine, it may manifest as hyperacidity, or looser stools.

You'll want to explore our popular article [How to Cool Pitta and Reduce Body Heat with Ayurveda](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/how-to-reduce-body-heat-and-with-ayurveda) \"If we still have not taken notice or steps to care for aggravated Pitta dosha, it continues to burn. Clients often have one heated digestive issue and then another and if Pitta dosha overflows from it's home in the digestive tract, it travels into general circulation and may manifest as heat flashes, flushing, skin conditions. Depending on the individual, Pitta is not properly pacified, it will continue to spread to other parts of the body and mind and Pitta dosha will establish itself, here, there and in time, possibly everywhere. Clients tell me, \"I feel inflamed all over and the doctors can't find what's wrong. From Ayurveda's view, yes--clients know what they feel--they feel Pitta that has spread. They will start their consultation with a list of 6-12 chief concerns, all with one root-Pitta dosha.

Read their [stories ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/testimonials)and see how clients put out the wild fire of Pitta dosha\" -Veena Thanks to modern dietary and lifestyle stressors, fiery Pitta dosha is prone to overheating - particularly in the summer months and during periods of stress. One of the most common symptoms of heated Pitta is Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as heartburn or acid reflux. If your sounding hoarse and it's not a cold, it might be GERD. According to [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/promotions/harvard-health-publications/sensitive-gut-apr2022-test?utm_source=delivra&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=GB20220921-SensitiveGut&utm_id=4149063&dlv-emuid=d58fbac7-98a8-43ac-8d5a-4aa5aacf4403&dlv-mlid=4149063),\"...your lower esophageal sphincter. That's the muscle that controls the passage between the esophagus and stomach, and when it doesn't close completely, stomach acid and food flow back into the esophagus. The medical term for this process is gastroesophageal reflux; the backward flow of acid is called acid reflux. Acid reflux can cause sore throats and hoarseness and may literally leave a bad taste in your mouth. When acid reflux produces chronic symptoms, it is known as gastroesophageal reflux disorder, or GERD. The most common symptom of GERD is heartburn\u2014pain in the upper abdomen and chest.\" Cooling Heated Pitta Dosha for Digestive Relief Ayurveda Treatment for Heartburn, Acid Reflux and GERD may offer you relief. If something you eat manifests with a fiery vengeance, you may be experiencing symptoms of GERD. Over 20% of Americans have heartburn at least once a week, and it's not just uncomfortable - it can cause serious health issues if left untreated. In Ayurveda, digestive issues like GERD are caused by an imbalance in Pitta dosha. To remedy these ailments, we must cool Pitta in the body.

There's rarely just one symptom of high Pitta You may think heartburn, loose bowel movements, and migraines are unrelated ailments - but they stem from the same root cause, aggravated Pitta dosha. Ayurveda connects the dots, and allows us to see how digestive function manifests as a multitude of bothersome issues. In general, GERD and other digestive symptoms of Pitta dosha - such as ulcerative colitis, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), inflammation, migraines, eczema, liver concerns-- may be considered, in part, lifestyle ailments. Thus, our diet, herbal remedies, and lifestyle practices can provide relief. Food as Medicine for Pitta Dosha Digestion Water helps soothe heated Pitta. Drinking plenty of warm or room temperature water. Water pacifies Pitta which can alleviate gastric issues such as heartburn, and loose bowel movements. Better yet is to drink herbalized tea specific to your constitution and needs. Avoid drinking coffee, soda, or alcohol - which can have the opposite effect. Ayurvedic Diet for Acid Reflux Processed foods are harder to digest - and spicy or oily foods aggravate inflamed Pitta. Incorporate mild, cooling foods to decrease internal heat. Eat meals when you're relaxed, at the same time every day, to help your digestive system find a healthy rhythm.
