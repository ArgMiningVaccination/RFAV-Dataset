W INTON Introduction Maintaining the health of hatchery fish requires a program of good man- agement and continuous attention to detail. In its most basic sense, dis-ease can be defined as a deviation of the body from its normal or healthystate, and disease in fish can be caused by infectious agents or by nonin-fectious conditions. Thus, optimal fish health is best achieved by rearingfish in a good environment, with good nutrition, with a minimum ofstress, and isolated from sources of infectious agents. Whenever pos-sible, prevention of infectious disease by avoidance of contact betweenthe host fish and a pathogen should be a critical goal. This is best achievedwith a pathogen-free water supply, the use of certified pathogen-freestocks, and strict attention to sanitation. The principal reasons for control of infectious diseases in hatcheries are to prevent losses in production; to prevent the introduction of patho-gens to new facilities when eggs, fry, or broodstock are moved; to pre-vent the spread of disease to wild fish via the hatchery effluent or whenhatchery fish are released or stocked out; and to prevent the amplifica-tion of pathogens already endemic in a watershed. Although only a fewfish pathogens cause human health problems (i.e., are zoonotic agents),certain hatchery practices can create a hazard when toxic compoundsare used or if fish are contaminated with drugs or chemicals when theyare released or sold as food. If a disease outbreak should occur, a seriousattempt should be made to eradicate the infectious agent from the facil-ity or to change the conditions that led to disease, rather than to relyupon frequent treatments to control future outbreaks.560 WINTON Since the first edition of this book in 1982, some very significant changes have occurred in the field of fish health. These include an im- proved fish health infrastructure for the diagnosis of fish diseases, thediscovery of important new fish pathogens, expansion of the host andgeographic ranges for some of the known pathogens, increased restric-tions on the use of drugs and chemicals in aquaculture, the applicationof molecular methods for improved diagnosis of diseases, elucidation ofimportant epizootiological features of fish diseases, creation of new regu-lations to prevent the spread of important diseases, and the develop-ment of novel methods for control of some diseases, including the com-mercial availability of effective vaccines. These topics are included inthis new version of the chapter. Disease Characteristics Factors Leading to Disease Conceptually, it is useful to think of disease or health as a set of interac- tions among the host, the pathogen, and the environment. Host factorsinclude the species of fish, size or age, strain or stock, immune status,and general physiological condition. For the pathogen, factors includethe number of infectious organisms present, the strain of the pathogen,and its virulence. The difference between health and disease typicallydepends on the balance between the pathogen and the host, and thatbalance is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as tempera-ture and water chemistry. For example, an adverse environmental factorsuch as high temperature may speed the replication of a pathogen andcause stress on the host resulting in reduced resistance. Stress plays a major role in the susceptibility of fish to infectious disease. Wild fish are typically in equilibrium with the pathogens thatare endemic within a geographic area under normal conditions, andnatural outbreaks are rarely observed unless major environmentalchanges occur. However, fish in intensive culture are frequently affectedby adverse environmental conditions (e.g., temperature or water qual-ity) and by management practices (e.g., crowding or handling) that canimpose significant stress on the defense mechanisms of most fishes.Whereas some pathogens of fish are highly virulent and cause diseaseeven in a well-managed facility, many diseases are enhanced by stress.For example, although several species of opportunistic bacterial patho-gens are present in many hatchery water supplies, disease typically willnot occur unless environmental quality or the defense systems of thefish have deteriorated. Prevention of these diseases can best be donethrough good hatchery management. Environmental stresses and asso-FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 561 ciated disease problems are minimized by high water quality, low rear- ing densities, and excellent nutrition. Two other types of disease are important to fish culturists in addition to those caused by pathogenic organisms. The first is nutritional in originand is usually caused by inadequate diet or poorly stored feeds. The sec-ond is caused by environmental factors, including bad hatchery practicesand poor water quality. Both of these classes of disease can result in sig-nificant losses if severe enough or uncorrected for a prolonged period.While these diseases are covered in other chapters of this book, it is im-portant to remember that such noninfectious diseases may act synergisti-cally with infectious agents to produce exceptionally high losses. Disease-Causing Organisms Organisms that cause diseases in fish include a large number of viruses,bacteria, fungi, protozoans, and metazoans. Generally, they can be cat-egorized as either pathogens or parasites, although the distinction is notalways clear. Viruses are submicroscopic agents that are dependent uponliving cells for their replication and often have highly specific require-ments for a particular host and even for certain tissues within that host.Viruses are always maintained in a host and are found free in nature onlyin a nonreplicating state. Bacteria may also be obligate pathogens if theycannot live outside a host; however, many bacterial fish pathogens arefound free-living in nature and only affect fish as opportunists. Protozo-ans and metazoans are considered parasites and can reside either insideor on the surface of the host. Pathogens or parasites do not always causedisease in fish, but may be present in a subclinical or carrier state. Disease Recognition Only a few fish diseases produce behaviors or clinical signs that are pathog-nomonic (specific to a given disease). Nevertheless, careful observation ofsigns exhibited by the fish will often allow one to restrict the cause of thedisease to a particular type (or group) of causative agent(s). Some obvious changes in behavior of fish suffering from disease in- clude (1) loss of appetite; (2) abnormal distribution in a pond or raceway,such as swimming at the surface, along the tank sides, or in slack water, orcrowding at the head or tail screens; (3) flashing, scraping on the bottomor sides of the rearing unit, darting, whirling, twisting, or loss of equilib-rium; and (4) weakness, loss of vitality, and loss of ability to withstandstresses during handling, grading, seining, loading, or transportation. In addition to changes in behavior, disease may produce physical signs such as lesions that can be seen by the unaided eye. Such gross562 WINTON signs may be external, internal, or both. Gross external signs of disease include darkening or discolored areas on the body; eroded areas, ulcers,or sores on the body, head, or fins; cysts, tumors, or swelling on thebody or gills; exophthalmia (popeye); and hemorrhages, especiallyaround the head and at the base of fins. Gross internal signs of diseaseare changes in the color of organs or tissues (pale liver or kidney or con-gested organs); hemorrhages in organs or tissues; changes in the textureor size of organs or tissues; accumulation of fluid in body cavities; andcysts, tumors, or lesions. Besides changes in behavior and gross physical signs, information such as the disease history of the facility, geographic area, species andage of fish, water temperature, and time of year can assist in the forma-tion of a presumptive diagnosis. If a serious disease problem is suspected,a fish health professional should be contacted immediately for assistancein identifying the causative agent and in helping to develop an appro-priate strategy to reduce potential losses. Defense Mechanisms of Fish As with all living organisms, fish stay healthy only if they prevent ex-cessive growth of microorganisms on their external surfaces and inva-sion of their tissues by pathogenic agents. Invasion of microorganismsis inhibited by physical barriers, and replication within the host is heldin check by natural and acquired immune mechanisms. Barriers Physical barriers are an important first line of defense. Fish eggs are pro-tected by the structurally tough and chemically resistant chorion. How-ever, during oogenesis, the egg may become infected or contaminated withcertain viruses or bacteria present in the female. Once hatched, the fry arethen likely to have become infected. Transmission of infectious agents fromadult to progeny via the egg is termed vertical transmission. Fishes are protected from injury and invasion of disease agents by the external barriers of mucus, scales, and skin. For example, the skinprotects against microbial colonization by continuously producing andsloughing mucus, which allows infectious agents only temporary resi-dence on the host. Mucus also may contain nonspecific antimicrobialsubstances, such as natural antibodies, lysozyme, or other antimicrobialfactors, as well as specific antibodies produced in response to prior in-fection or vaccination. Gill tissue also contains mucus cells that can serve the same purpose as those in the skin. However, irritants may cause accumulation of mu-FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 563 cus on the gill tissue and lead to asphyxiation. This is an example of a defense mechanism that can work against the host. Immune Mechanisms The immune system of the fish can be divided into nonspecific defensemechanisms (also termed natural immunity), which are effective againsta broad range of organisms, and specific defense mechanisms, whichare usually acquired upon recovery from infection with a given patho-gen or following vaccination. In addition, both nonspecific and specificdefense mechanisms may be innate (present continuously) or inducedby infection or vaccination. One of the primary natural defense mecha-nisms is the inflammatory response of the vascular system, which is trig-gered by invasion of pathogenic agents and other irritants. Dilation ofcapillaries increases the supply of humoral and cellular agents at thefocus of infection. The inflammatory response proceeds to dilute, local-ize, destroy, and remove the agent that stimulated the response. Fish, like most animals, also have an important defense mechanism in the form of fixed and wandering phagocytes in the lymphatic andcirculatory systems. Phagocytes are cells capable of ingesting bacteria,foreign particles, and infected cells. Fish also have natural killer cells,natural antibodies, and other innate humoral and cell-mediated defensesagainst infectious disease that are intrinsic to the species and individual.An example is the production of interferon in response to viral infection.This induced response is nonspecific and increases resistance to othervirus infections, as well as to the agent that stimulated it. These types ofdefenses may account for some portion of the differences in the naturalresistance of various species and strains of fish to certain diseases. Someof these differences have been shown to have a genetic basis as resis-tance to a pathogen may differ between families of the same species offish and the trait shows significant heritability. Fish have a relatively well-developed specific immune system and are able to produce both circulating antibodies (humoral response) anda cell-mediated response to antigenic stimuli. These humoral and cellu-lar arms of the immune system are required to respond in differing de-grees for various viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal pathogens. Thefish's immune system shows proliferation of specific cells involved inthe immune response and an immunological memory to a limited de-gree. These specific, adaptive immune responses are also stimulated byvaccines that are commercially available and that can be used to protectfish against certain diseases. The immune response of cold-blooded ani-mals depends heavily upon environmental temperature. Lowering ofthe water temperature below a fish's optimum usually reduces or de-564 WINTON lays the onset of the immune response. Other environmental factors that stress the fish, as well as various physiological states (e.g., spawning)can reduce the magnitude or efficacy of the immune response. Age isalso an important factor. The fish's specific immune system developsafter hatching and, depending upon species and temperature, may notbe fully functional until the fish is several months of age. Genetic Resistance Significant heritabilities have been shown for resistance to various fishdiseases, and, under controlled environmental conditions, some increasedresistance to a disease can be expected from a managed breeding pro-gram. However, selection for resistance to several pathogens can be dif-ficult, except perhaps for closely related diseases. Intentionally or unin-tentionally, specific disease resistance has been increased at hatcheriesby the continued use of survivors of outbreaks as broodstock. Potentialexists for genetic selection and breeding to increase the survival of propa-gated fishes, but certain risks must be anticipated in any major breedingprogram that may be counter to programs designed to maintain the ge-netic composition of wild stocks. In addition, changes in gene frequen-cies resulting from selection for disease resistance may cause changes inthe frequencies of other genes that are unrelated to disease resistanceleading to a concomitant loss in some other desired trait (e.g., growth orfecundity). Thus, managers always run the risk of altering the fitness oftheir stock in unwanted ways during selective breeding programs. In any natural population, individual fish may be found that are more or less resistant to the common diseases. In a population of wildfish, this natural genetic variation among individuals is important toensure that not all fish in the population are equally susceptible duringchanges in the environment or in the levels or types of pathogens present.Natural recombination within the breeding population assures that thesevariations are maintained. In the absence of important needs to the con-trary, any artificial propagation program should ensure that a similargenetic variability is maintained within the population as its lack mayput the entire population at risk. Diseases of Fish The first edition of this book had photographs and relatively detaileddescriptions of many of the major infectious diseases of hatchery fishthat were known at the time. It also included recommendations for treat-ment, sometimes using drugs or chemicals that were not approved forFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 565 use in food fish. Because the field of fish health was relatively new, there were few books or reference materials that could be consulted by thehatchery manager. Also, the fish health infrastructure available to assisthatchery managers was poor in many areas. In the nearly 20 years fol-lowing publication of the first edition, the amount of information onfish diseases has expanded exponentially and many excellent referenceshave become available that describe the clinical signs, diagnosis, andtreatment of fish diseases. Furthermore, the list of diseases affecting cul-tured fish has continually grown as new species are reared or as estab-lished species are cultured in new geographic areas. Finally, the networkof fish health professionals has improved greatly, and several organiza-tions have published books containing standard methods for the diag-nosis of fish diseases. For these reasons, this new edition will only brieflydescribe some of the most significant diseases of the fish species cul-tured in North America. The material in the following sections has been developed from in- formation contained in references listed at the end of this chapter. Forfurther information, these references should be consulted. It is assumedthat a progressive hatchery manager will have a library containing manyof these references and an established relationship with a fish healthprofessional who can provide expert advice in the diagnosis and treat-ment of fish diseases. Viral Diseases of Fish Among the infectious diseases of fish, those caused by viruses are im-portant because they can result in explosive, uncontrollable losses andare often the subject of state, federal, and international regulations. Be-cause viral diseases of fish are untreatable and there are few approvedvaccines for their prevention, avoidance of the pathogen remains themajor control option available. This is best accomplished by rearing fishin a virus-free water supply, using only certified virus-free stocks, pay-ing strict attention to sanitation, and having sound quarantine practices.While requiring effort, it is still easier to avoid viral pathogens than todeal with their effects or to try to eradicate them from a facility onceintroduced. For hatcheries having open water supplies and that are lo-cated in an endemic area, viral diseases can present insurmountable prob-lems. For example, until methods were developed for avoidance of in-fectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), sockeye salmon could notbe propagated successfully in Alaskan hatcheries having open watersupplies because the virus was present in wild, spawning adults in nearlyall populations tested.566 WINTON The host specificity of fish viruses can vary widely. Some have a broad range of species in which they replicate, while other viruses have a verynarrow host range that may include only certain tissues within a singlehost. Similarly, there may be significant genetic differences among strainsof fish viruses within certain virus groups resulting in substantial differ-ences in virulence or in reactivity with serological reagents. Many of thesedifferent strains occur within a defined geographical area making it im-portant to restrict viruses to locations in which they are endemic. The diagnosis of viral diseases has traditionally relied upon growth of the virus in cell culture and identification by various serological meth-ods including neutralization, fluorescent antibody, and enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assays. These methods are time-consuming, relativelylabor intensive, and require specialized training and equipment. In re-cent years, the techniques of molecular biology have produced new di-agnostic tools having great speed and precision. Among the new ap-proaches are the use of monoclonal antibodies, DNA probes, and thepolymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identification of a viral pathogen.However, many of the required certification examinations still rely uponcell culture methods because they are considered validated or bench-marked tests. In some cases, nonlethal methods have been developedthat typically rely upon detection of neutralizing antibodies in a popu-lation of fish and, more recently, the use of PCR to detect viral genomesin nonlethal samples such as blood or mucus. While a diagnosis of a viral disease is relatively straightforward, the management implications are not. Because fish viral diseases can becaused by strains of the causative agent having differences in host speci-ficity, virulence, serological reactions, or growth characteristics, it maybe necessary to examine the causative agent further before a recommen-dation can be made as to the disposition of the stock. For example, fishharboring a low level of IHNV should not be moved to other water-sheds, even those containing fish infected with IHNV, unless it has beenshown that an identical strain of the virus is present. Similarly, the emer-gence or introduction of a different strain of virus at a hatchery shouldbe treated with caution. During the time since the first edition of this book, the number of identified fish viruses has increased very substantially and only a fewwill be discussed below. Other viral diseases may be important locally,and the conscientious fish hatchery manager will become familiar withthose diseases at risk of being found among the species cultured in thegeographic area in which the facility is located. Many of the followingviral diseases are listed by the Office International des Epizooties as be-ing either \"Notifiable\" or as \"Other Significant Diseases\" of finfish, whilea few others are included that are of interest to aquaculture.FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 567 Rhabdoviral Diseases The rhabdoviruses that infect finfish generally cause viremia with re- sulting hemorrhage and widespread necrosis of major organ systems,which may result in very high losses. These viruses have a relativelybroad host specificity and are among the oldest and best studied viralpathogens of fish. The diseases caused by these viruses typically showboth a size and temperature dependence. Viral Hemorrhagic SepticemiaViral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is best known as an infectious dis- ease of rainbow trout, brown trout, grayling, whitefish, northern pike,and turbot. The disease is caused by viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus(VHSV, synonym: Egtved virus). Formerly thought to be confined towestern Europe, in the last decade, VHSV has been isolated from anincreasing number of free-living marine fish species in the North PacificOcean, the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. Typically, isolates of VHSV from marine fish are not distinguishable from normal freshwater isolates by serological means; however, isolatesof VHSV from the Pacific Ocean are genetically distinguishable from theEuropean isolates. There appear to be several distinct genetic lineagesamong the European isolates. In contrast to the European freshwaterstrain, isolates from wild marine fish species in both North America andEurope typically induce low mortality in infection trials with rainbowtrout fry. Several European marine isolates are pathogenic to turbot fry,and isolates from marine species in the Pacific are highly pathogenic toPacific herring. Among rainbow trout infected with the European freshwater strains, infection is often lethal due to the impairment of the osmotic balanceand occurs within a clinical context of edema and hemorrhages. Virusmultiplication in endothelial cells of blood capillaries, leukocytes, he-matopoietic tissues, and nephron cells underlies the clinical signs. The reservoirs of VHSV are clinically infected fish and covert carri- ers among cultured, feral, or wild fish in the marine environment and infreshwater. Virus is shed in the feces, urine, and sexual fluids, whereaskidney, spleen, heart, liver, and digestive tract are the sites in which vi-rus is most abundant. Several factors influence susceptibility to VHSV .Among each fish species, there is individual variability in susceptibility,and the age of the fish appears to be of some importance\u2014the youngerthe fish, the higher the susceptibility. In susceptible fish stocks, how-ever, overt infection is seen in all sizes of fish. Water temperature is an important environmental factor. Disease gen- erally occurs at temperatures between 4 and 14\u00b0C (39.2 and 57.2\u00b0F). Low568 WINTON water temperatures (1-5\u00b0C [33.8-41.0\u00b0F]) generally result in an extended course with low daily mortality, but high total mortality. At high watertemperatures (15-18\u00b0C [59.0-64.4\u00b0F]), the disease generally takes a shortcourse with an initial acute mortality, but a more modest accumulatedmortality. VHS outbreaks occur during all seasons, but are most com-mon in spring when water temperatures are rising or fluctuating. Control methods for VHS rely upon avoidance of the virus through official health surveillance plans coupled with control measures, such aseradication. Effective use of these measures has resulted in the eradica-tion of the disease from several parts of Europe. At present, effectivevaccines are in the experimental stage as are genetic approaches usingselection for disease-resistant stocks. Infectious Hematopoietic NecrosisInfectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is an important infectious dis- ease of rainbow or steelhead trout; Pacific salmon, including chinook,sockeye, chum, cherry (also known as amago and yamame), and cohosalmon; and Atlantic salmon. Historically, the geographical range of IHNwas limited to the western parts of North America, but the disease, causedby a rhabdovirus (IHNV), has spread to continental Europe and the FarEast via the importation of infected fish and eggs. IHN has become acause for concern because of its clinical and economic consequences introut and salmon farming and its effects on wild stocks. Infection is of-ten lethal due to the impairment of osmotic balance and occurs within aclinical context of edema and hemorrhages. Virus multiplication in en-dothelial cells of blood capillaries, hematopoietic tissues, and nephroncells underlies the clinical signs. High levels of virus are shed from in-fected juvenile fish. Older fish are increasingly resistant to infection, butadult fish at spawning may shed virus in sexual products. Survivors ofIHNV infection demonstrate a strong protective immunity with the syn-thesis of circulating antibodies to the virus and, in certain individuals, acovert carrier state. Variations in the virulence of IHNV strains have beenrecorded during both natural cases of disease and in experimental infec-tions. The reservoirs of IHNV are clinically infected fish and covert carri- ers among cultured, feral, or wild fish. Virus is shed via feces, urine,sexual fluids, and external mucus, whereas kidney, spleen, encephalon,and the digestive tract are the sites in which virus is most abundantduring the course of overt infection. The transmission of IHNV betweenfish is primarily horizontal; however, cases of vertical or \"egg-associ-ated\" transmission have been recorded. Horizontal transmission is typi-cally by direct exposure, but invertebrate vectors have been proposed toplay a role in some cases. Egg-associated transmission is significantlyreduced by the now common practice of surface disinfection of eggsFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 569 with an iodophor solution; but egg-associated transmission is the only mechanism accounting for the appearance of IHN in new geographicallocations among alevins originating from eggs that were incubated andhatched in virus-free water. Once IHNV is established in a farmed stockor in a watershed, the disease may reside among carrier fish. Among individuals of each fish species, there is a high degree of variation in susceptibility to IHNV. The age of the fish appears to beextremely important\u2014the younger the fish, the more susceptible to dis-ease. As with VHSV , good overall fish health condition seems to decreasethe susceptibility to overt IHN, while handling and other types of stressfrequently cause subclinical infections to become overt. The most prominent environmental factor affecting IHN is water temperature. Clinical disease occurs between 8\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C (46.4\u00b0F and59.0\u00b0F) under natural conditions. Control methods for IHN currently rely on avoidance of exposure to the virus through the implementation of strict control policies andsound hygiene practices. The thorough disinfection of fertilized eggsand the incubation of eggs and rearing of fry and alevins in virus-freewater supplies are critical for preventing the occurrence of IHNV in adefined fish production site. At present, vaccination is at an experimen-tal stage; however, several new vaccine preparations have shown sub-stantial promise in both laboratory and field trials. Spring Viremia of CarpSpring viremia of carp (SVC) is a rhabdoviral disease of several carp and other cyprinid fish species. Overt infections have been recognized in com-mon carp, grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, crucian carp, goldfish,tench, and sheatfish. The common carp is the most susceptible of thesespecies and is the principal host. The geographical range of SVC includescountries of the European continent that experience low water tempera-tures during winter, although the disease may be present in Asia and otherregions where carp are traditionally reared or have been introduced. As with other rhabdoviruses of fish, infection by SVC virus (SVCV) can be lethal due to the impairment of water balance that occurs in aclinical context of edema and hemorrhages. Virus multiplication, espe-cially in cells of blood capillaries, hematopoietic tissue, andnephron cells, underlies the clinical signs. Overcoming SVCV infection results in a strong protective immunity associated with the presence of circulating antibodies detectable by meth-ods such as virus neutralization, immunofluorescence, or enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay. In certain individuals, this health status also re-sults in a covert virus carrier state. Differences in virulence of virus strainshave been recorded during natural cases of disease and experimentalinfections. A related virus, the northern pike fry rhabdovirus, shares570 WINTON antigens that cross-react in some serological tests, but the two agents can be distinguished by serum neutralization tests and by molecularmethods. The reservoirs of SVCV are clinically infected fish and covert virus carriers from cultured, feral, or wild fish. Virulent virus is shed in thefeces, urine, gill and skin mucus, and from the exudate of skin blisters oredematous scale pockets. However, liver, kidney, spleen, gill, and en-cephalon are the organs in which SVCV is most abundant during thecourse of overt infection. The principal mode of transmission for SVCV is horizontal from fish to fish, but vertical or egg-associated transmission cannot be ruled out.Animate vectors and fomites are also involved in transmission of SVCV .Among animate piscicola are able to transfer SVCV from diseased to healthy fish. Once SVCV is established in pond stock or pond farm stock, it maybe very difficult to eradicate without destroying all kinds of life on theproduction site. There is a high variability in the degree of susceptibility to SVC among individuals of the same fish species. Apart from the physiologi-cal state of the fish, age or age-related status of innate immunity appearsto be extremely important: the younger the fish, the higher the suscepti-bility to overt disease, but even adult broodfish can be susceptible toinfection. Water temperature is a critical environmental factor. In year-ling or older fish, overt infection is not often observed above 17\u00b0C (62.6\u00b0F),whereas fry can be affected at temperatures as high as 22-23\u00b0C (71.6-73.4\u00b0F). The implementation of hygiene measures and control policiesare the only control methods currently feasible. Vaccination is still mostlyat the experimental stage. Herpesviral Diseases Fish herpesviruses usually have a rather narrow host specificity. Thediseases caused by herpesviruses vary from external, fluid-filled blis-ters, to systemic infections affecting several organ systems and the pro-duction of tumors on the body of the fish. Some of these herpesvirusdiseases are described below. Channel Catfish Virus DiseaseChannel catfish virus disease (CCVD) is caused by a herpesvirus desig- nated Ictalurid herpesvirus 1, but the commonly used name is channelcatfish virus (CCV). Channel catfish virus affects channel catfish in theUnited States. Channel catfish virus disease is of importance because ofits clinical and economic consequences in channel catfish farming whereFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 571 it causes high mortality rates in populations of fry and juvenile catfish in the summer months. Diseased fish demonstrate ascites, exophthalmia,and hemorrhage in fins and musculature. Histologically, the most re-markable damage occurs in the kidney with extensive necrosis of renaltubules and interstitial tissue. In survivors, CCVD results in a strong protective immunity, the syn- thesis of circulating antibodies to the virus, and a covert latent carrierstate. During this latent carrier state, the virus is undetectable by tradi-tional culture or antigen detecting means, even when adults are immu-nosuppressed during spawning. Some variation in the virulence of CCVstrains has been recorded during natural outbreaks of disease and hasbeen demonstrated experimentally. Additionally, molecular data indi-cate genetic variation among isolates of the virus. Reservoirs of CCV are clinically infected fish and covert carriers. Infectious CCV can be detected in the water from tanks of experimen-tally infected fish, but the route of shedding has not been determined.The sites where the virus is most abundant during the course of overtinfection are posterior kidney, skin, gill, spleen, and intestine, respec-tively, in decreasing magnitude. The transmission of CCV is horizontaland vertical. Animate vectors and fomites could also act in CCV trans-mission. Vertical transmission is thought to be common, but the mecha-nism of vertical transmission is not known as infectious virus has notbeen detected on the skin or in the sexual products of spawning adults.Once CCVD occurs in a fish population, it becomes established amongcarrier fish. Channel catfish and blue catfish are the only species naturally in- fected with CCV , and variations in susceptibility to CCV have been re-corded depending on fish strain. The age of the fish is extremely impor-tant for overt infection. Although experimental data suggest that olderfish are susceptible to natural outbreaks of acute CCVD, the disease oc-curs almost exclusively in fish that are less than 1 year of age and gener-ally less than 4 months of age. Water temperature is the critical environ-mental factor. The mortality rate is high above 27\u00b0C (80.6\u00b0F), but readilydecreases and ceases below 18\u00b0C (64.4\u00b0F). Control methods currently rely on maintaining relatively low stock- ing densities and avoiding stressful handling of young fish during thesummer months. Also, control policies and hygiene practices have beenused, where practical, in catfish husbandry. The incubation of eggs andrearing of fry and juveniles in facilities separated from carrier popula-tions are critical for preventing the occurrence of CCVD in a CCV-freefish production site. Because the virus is only detected during activeoutbreaks, defining CCV-free status has been done largely from histori-cal data or by identifying populations that are seronegative to the virus.572 WINTON Recent use of PCR and DNA probes to detect latent CCV genomic DNA suggests that CCV is present in many populations that have no historyof the disease. Vaccination, although experimentally promising, is not inuse at this time. Salmonid Herpesviral DiseasesTwo herpesviruses of salmonids are currently (formerly termed Herpesvirus salmonis herpesvirus 1 was originally isolated rainbowtrout broodstock in Washington State. Subsequently, steelhead trout inCalifornia were also found to be carriers of the virus. However, the virushas been shown to be of relatively low pathogenicity for salmonids andis now regarded as being of limited concern. In contrast, Oncorhynchus masou virus disease (OMVD) is an onco- genic and ulcerative condition among salmonid fish in Japan and prob-ably in the coastal rivers of eastern Asia that harbor Pacific salmon. InJapan, the causative agent has been given a variety of names, but is nowtermed Oncorhynchus masou virus or salmonid herpesvirus 2. are susceptible to OMV include kokanee salmon, cherry salmon(also known as masu salmon), chum salmon, coho salmon, and rainbowtrout. On the basis of antigenic studies conducted with neutralizingpolyclonal rabbit antisera, OMV can be easily distinguished from salmo-nid herpesvirus 1. Clinically, the initial infection by OMV appears as a systemic and frequently lethal infection that is associated with edema and hemor-rhages. Virus multiplication in endothelial cells of blood capillaries, he-matopoietic tissue, and hepatocytes underlies the clinical signs. Fourmonths after this first clinical condition, a varying number of survivingfish exhibit epitheliomas occurring mainly around the mouth (upper andlower jaw) and, to a lesser extent, on the caudal fin, opercula, and bodysurface. These neoplastic growths may persist for up to 1 year post-infection. In the case of coho salmon, 1-year-old infected fish, in particu-lar, show ulcers on the skin, white spots on the liver, and tumors aroundthe mouth parts or body surface. In rainbow trout, the diseased fish ex-hibit almost no external signs, although some fish manifest ulcerativelesions on the skin. Internally, intestinal hemorrhages and white spotson the liver are observed. Following the septicemic phase, an immune response takes place that results in the synthesis of neutralizing antibodies to OMV. A carrierstate frequently occurs, which leads to virus shedding via the sexualproducts at the time of spawning. The reservoirs of OMV are clinically infected fish and covert carriers among groups of cultured, feral, or wild fish. Infectious virus is shed viaFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 573 feces, urine, sexual products, and probably skin mucus; whereas the kid- ney, spleen, liver, and tumors are the sites where virus is the most abun-dant during the course of overt infection. The transmission of OMV ishorizontal and possibly egg-associated. Disinfection of the eggs just af-ter fertilization or at the eyed stage is effective in preventing OMV infec-tion. OMV disease has not been reported in alevins originating from dis-infected eggs that had been incubated and hatched in virus-free water. Salmonids are the only fish species susceptible to OMV. The age of the fish is critical. One-month-old alevins are the most susceptible toinfection. The main environmental factor favoring OMV infection is lowwater temperature (below 14\u00b0C [57.2\u00b0F]). Control methods currently rely on the implementation of avoidance and hygiene practices in the operating of salmonid husbandry. The thor-ough disinfection of fertilized eggs and the incubation of these eggs andrearing of fry and alevins in premises completely separated from thoseharboring virus carriers and free from contact with fomites are the keymeasures needed to decrease contamination of OMV in a defined fishproduction site. as carp pox or epithelioma papulosum and is most often seen as benign, raised, white to gray, hyperplastic papillomas onthe body surface. The lesions are smooth and may eventually cover largeareas in fish that are stressed. Koi (ornamental strain of common carp)and common carp are the most often affected; however, the disease hasbeen reported from other cyprinid species. The disease probably has aworldwide distribution wherever cyprinids are native or have been in-troduced. It is common in Europe and Asia and has been reported fromareas of the United States where cyprinids are commercially reared. Inaddition to monetary losses from the unsightly lesions, the disease canproduce mortality in juvenile cyprinids. The causative virus is a typicalherpesvirus and can be detected by isolation in carp cell lines. Serumneutralization tests and molecular probes have been used to confirmmany features of the life cycle of the virus. Cyprinid herpesvirus is probably shed from the external lesions to affect juvenile fish in the rearing water. Infection of juvenile carp canresult in a distended abdomen, darkening, exophthalmia, hemorrhages,and high mortality. Fish that recover often become carriers and will showexternal lesions much later in life. The induction of these lesions, likecold sores in humans, is thought to be stress related. At lower tempera-tures (15\u00b0C [59.0\u00b0F]), the carp immune system is less effective and virusreplication can lead to production of the characteristic lesions. However,at warmer temperatures when conditions are favorable for the host (20-574 WINTON 30\u00b0C [68.0-86.0\u00b0F]) and the fish immune system is fully operational, the lesions will regress and disappear. There is no control method other than avoidance. Carp to be shipped into an area where the disease has not been reported should come fromstocks that have been carefully screened and that have no history of thedisease. The long incubation period and latency of the virus make patho-gen-free certification difficult. More recently, an important emerging viral disease of cyprinids has caused mass mortality of koi carp in Israel and the eastern United States.The principal external signs of the disease were pale and irregularly col-ored gills. Microscopically, the gills showed severe hyperplasia and ne-crosis of the epithelial cells. A new herpesvirus was isolated from dis-eased fish using a koi carp cell line. Experimental infections producedhigh mortality in koi, and the virus was reisolated from several tissuesof the dead fish. This new herpesvirus of cyprinids can be differentiatedfrom Herpesvirus cyprini by Birnaviral Diseases The aquatic birnaviruses are small, icosahedral viruses belonging to the family Birnaviridae and have a genome composed of two segments ofdouble-stranded RNA. Birnaviruses have been isolated from a very largenumber of fish, crustacean, and mollusk species in both freshwater andmarine environments. Serological and genetic testing has revealed thatthere are very substantial differences among the various isolates. Withinthis collection are viruses that seem to cause little mortality within thehosts that have been experimentally infected, as well as viruses that causevery high mortality in important species for aquaculture. Infectious Pancreatic NecrosisInfectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a highly contagious viral disease of salmonids. The disease, caused by infectious pancreatic necrosis vi-rus (IPNV) most characteristically occurs in fry of rainbow trout, brooktrout, brown trout, Atlantic salmon, and several Pacific salmon species.Susceptibility generally decreases with age, except for Atlantic salmonsmolts, which can suffer from the disease after transfer to seawater. Thefirst sign of an outbreak is frequently a sudden and, usually, progressiveincrease in daily mortality, particularly in the faster growing individu-als. Clinical signs include darkening, a pronounced distended abdomen,and a spiral swimming motion. Cumulative mortalities may vary fromless than 10% to more than 90% depending on the virus strain, size andspecies of host, and environmental conditions. The disease is transmitted both horizontally through the water routeFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 575 and vertically via the egg. Surface disinfection of eggs is not entirely effective in preventing vertical transmission. The disease has a wide geographical distribution, occurring in most, if not all, major salmonid-farming countries of North and South America,Europe, and Asia. Different isolates of IPNV display wide antigenic diversity and marked differences in degrees of virulence. Other birnaviruses showingserological relatedness to IPNV have been reported to cause diseases insome farmed marine fish species, such as yellowtail, turbot, and halibut;subclinical covert infections have been detected in a wide range of es-tuarine and freshwater fish species, such as loach, northern pike, andnumerous other currently rely on the implementation of control policies and of hygiene practices in salmonid husbandry, through theavoidance of the introduction of fertilized eggs originating from IPNV-carrier broodstock, and through the use of a protected water supply (e.g.,spring or well) where the ingress of fish, particularly virus carriers, canbe prevented. In outbreaks, reducing the population density may helpto reduce the overall mortality. No treatment is available. A recombinantDNA vaccine is commercially available in Norway to protect Atlanticsalmon, and other vaccines are in development and appear promising. Orthomyxoviral Diseases A good example of an emerging viral disease is found among theorthomyxoviruses. Until the 1980s, the only observation of a diseasethought to be caused by a member of this group of viruses was recordedamong eels. Later, increasing losses among Atlantic salmon in Norwayresulted in the discovery of an important pathogen that has now beenidentified in salmonids from several countries. Infectious Salmon AnemiaInfectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a disease of Atlantic salmon caused by an orthomyxovirus. It has, so far, been reported to occur in Norway,the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. Atlantic salmon isthe only susceptible fish species known to develop the disease, but theISA virus (ISAV) may survive and replicate in brown trout (also knownas sea trout), rainbow trout, and Atlantic herring, which could act ascarriers of the virus. Clinically, the initial infection appears as a systemicand lethal condition that is characterized by anemia, ascites, congestion,576 WINTON and darkening and enlargement of the liver and spleen, as well as peri- toneal petechiae (small, inflamed red lesions). Hemorrhages in the eyesmay also be seen. Hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, tubularnecrosis, and hemorrhages in the kidneys are consistent histopathologi-cal findings in typical outbreaks. The infection is mainly observed infish held in seawater or in fish exposed to seawater, but indications ofdisease outbreaks in fish held in freshwater have also been reported.The infection spreads slowly and the virus is considered to be of lowvirulence, although high mortality can ensue in some outbreaks of dis-ease. The reservoirs of ISAV are not known with certainty, but spread of the disease has occurred from the movement of subclinically infectedAtlantic salmon smolts from farm to farm and from the effluent of slaugh-terhouses where organic material (especially blood and processing wa-ter) from ISA-infected fish has been discharged directly into seawaterwithout further treatment. The presence of natural reservoirs of ISAVamong marine fish species is supported by the isolation of geneticallydistinct strains of the virus from Atlantic salmon cultured in sea cages indifferent geographic areas. Few environmental factors have been identi-fied that can be directly linked to outbreaks of the disease. In a latentcarrier population, various stress factors, such as treatment againstsalmon lice, cestodes, or infectious diseases may be followed by diseaseoutbreaks some 2-3 weeks later. The incidence of ISA may be greatly reduced by implementation of general regulatory measures regarding the movement of fish, manda-tory health control, and slaughterhouse and transport regulations, aswell as specific measures including restrictions on affected, suspected,and neighboring epizootiological and wastewater from fish slaughterhouses and fish processingplants. Development of an effective vaccine will be a critical step towardthe eventual control of ISA in marine aquaculture and a killed viral vac-cine shows significant promise in field trials. Iridoviral Diseases Another good example of emerging diseases of finfish is seen in the in-creasing number of iridoviruses isolated from outbreaks of disease amongfish and amphibians on several continents. For many years, the onlyiridoviral diseases of significance among finfish were lymphocystis andviral erythrocytic necrosis (VEN). These diseases caused external wartygrowths (lymphocystis) among many freshwater and marine species oran erythrocytic anemia (VEN) among many marine species. In recentFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 577 years, severe losses have been associated with a group of iridoviruses that are related to the amphibian pathogens that are members of theRanavirus genus of the family Iridoviridae . Systemic Freshwater RanavirusesEpizootic hematopoietic necrosis (EHN) is a systemic iridovirus (ranavirus) infection of redfin perch (also known as Eurasian perch),rainbow trout, sheatfish, and catfish. The disease is caused by one of agroup of closely related iridoviruses: epizootic The geographical range of EHNV is currently restricted toAustralia. The ECV and ESV agents have only been detected among fishin Europe. In North America, a virus has been isolated from largemouthbass that appears similar to these agents suggesting this group of vi-ruses from fish and amphibians is distributed worldwide. Althoughclosely related and inducing similar diseases in their respective hosts,these viruses can be distinguished from each other by molecular tech-niques. Epizootic hematopoietic necrosis is generally lethal in redfin perch, while rainbow trout are relatively resistant and only a small proportionof individuals become infected. Infections with ESV and ECV can in-duce high morbidity and mortality in their catfish hosts. The largemouthbass virus (LMBV) has been associated with large natural mortalitiesamong bass in the southern United States. The disease caused by thesesystemic iridoviruses is characterized by necrosis in the liver, spleen,hematopoietic tissue of the kidney, and other tissues. Experimental ex-posure studies have shown that rainbow trout can be infected by ECVand ESV without showing morbidity and mortality, while infections oflargemouth bass with LMBV produce darkening, spiral swimming, ab-dominal distention, listlessness, and high mortality. The viruses can be identified by immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or immunoelectron microscopy. The viruses shareseveral antigens with each other and at least one antigen in commonwith the amphibian iridoviruses from North America (Frog Virus 3) andAustralia (Bohle Iridovirus). Polyclonal antibodies against EHNV PCR assays can differentiate, to varying degrees, amongthe viruses. The factors modulating the susceptibility of fish to systemic iridovirus infection are poorly understood. Clinical outbreaks due toEHNV are associated with poor water quality. In rainbow trout, infec-tion occurs naturally at water temperatures from 11\u00b0C to 17\u00b0C (51.8\u00b0F to578 WINTON (46.4\u00b0F to 69.8\u00b0F). Disease in redfin perch does not occur at temperatures below 12\u00b0C (53.6\u00b0F). Thefollowing fish species were found to be susceptible to EHNV followingbath exposure: redfin perch, rainbow trout, Macquarie perch, perch, and mountain galaxias. Both juvenile andadult redfin perch may be affected in outbreaks, but juveniles may bemore susceptible to the disease. EHNV has now been detected in dis-eased rainbow trout ranging from hatchery fry to table-sized fish, al-though mortalities are most often seen in sturgeon iridoviral is a significant cause of mortality among farm-raised juvenile white sturgeon in North Americaand among Russian sturgeon in Europe. Lake sturgeon have been infected. iridovirus America; thesource of WSIV was assumed to originate from adult wild white stur-geon broodstock collected from the Sacramento River in California andthe Columbia River and its tributaries in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.The virus also has been detected among wild juvenile white sturgeoncollected from the lower Columbia River, and the virus is potentiallyendemic in wild white sturgeon populations throughout the PacificNorthwest of North America. An iridovirus similar to WSIV has beenidentified in Russian sturgeon from Northern Europe where it may beendemic among cultured populations of several species of sturgeon. The WSIV infects tissues of the skin, gills, and upper alimentary tract. Infections of the oral mucosa and olfactory organ epithelium are pre-sumed causes of the cessation of feeding that leads to a progressive ema-ciation or starvation of the fish\u2014the principal external sign of the dis-ease. Cumulative mortality of up to 95% has been reported among groupsof infected fish in the hatchery and secondary infections with externalprotozoa or bacteria often contribute to the overall mortality. Infectedfish with moderate to severe emaciation began dying 2-3 weeks follow-ing exposure to the virus at water temperatures of 17-19\u00b0C (62.6-66.2\u00b0F).Hemorrhages on the abdomen and the ventral scutes may be present,but these are not specific for WSIVD. There are no specific internal signsof infection as the virus does not invade systemically. Viral infection isevident on microscopic observation of stained tissue sections from in-fected fish. The integument and, particularly, the skin may show focal ordiffuse hyperplasia with characteristic amphophilic to basophilic en-larged Malpighian cells. The cells are filled with virus particles as dem-onstrated by electron microscopy. The modes of transmission of WSIV are not completely understood,FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 579 but horizontal transmission via water has been demonstrated in the hatch- ery and experimentally in the laboratory. There is strong circumstantialevidence that the virus is transmitted vertically from adult broodstock,but the virus has never been isolated or observed in adult fish. There appears to be little antigenic relationship of WSIV to the sys- temic iridoviral agents represented by EHNV or the red sea breamiridovirus from Asia. The larger size and inner membrane structure ofthe WSIV virion, host cell line specificity, type of cytopathic effect, andthe location of the target host cells (epitheliotropic and not systemic)distinguish the agent from other groups of fish iridoviruses. Control methods currently rely on avoidance of the agent where possible. Because there are currently no methods for detecting the virusin adult broodstock, quarantine and testing of juveniles suffering mor-tality are the principal means to detect WSIV in young fish. LymphocystisLymphocystis disease, although rarely lethal, is of interest because of its wide range of occurrence among many propagated and free-ranging fishspecies. Many marine and freshwater fish species are susceptible, butthe disease has not been reported among salmonids. Among freshwaterfishes, walleyes and most centrarchids are susceptible. Lymphocystis is a chronic viral disease causing generally granular, wart-like or nodular tissue lesions composed of greatly enlarged hostcells and their covering membrane. Cells of infected tissue may attain asize of a millimeter or more and resemble a spattering of sand-like gran-ules or, when larger, a raspberry-like appearance. The causative agent of the disease is an iridovirus maintained in susceptible host fishes. Healthy fish may be exposed when infected cellsburst and the virus particles are released. This release of virus can occurintermittently through the duration of infection or can be massive upondeath and decomposition of infected fish. Lymphocystis lesions are per-sistent and commonly remain for several months; some may continuefor a year or more. No method of treatment is known and avoidance remains the only control strategy. Fish with the disease should be removed from the popu-lation to control the spread of the infection. Bacterial Diseases of Fish Bacterial diseases of fish have been recognized for many years, althoughnew examples are continually being discovered as new species of fishare placed into aquaculture for the first time or as traditional species arecultured in new geographic areas. Today, perhaps more than 100 bacte-580 WINTON rial species have been isolated from diseased fish and many of these have been demonstrated to be pathogens. In a few cases, these bacterialspecies can infect humans and are termed zoonotic agents. The diagnosis of bacterial diseases has traditionally been accom- plished by light microscopy and by culture of the bacteria on appropri-ate artificial media followed by identification using biochemical or sero-logical testing. More recently, techniques of molecular biology (e.g., PCR)have provided rapid and sensitive alternatives. While many bacterial diseases of fish are treatable with drugs or chemicals, the widespread use of these compounds has become of in-creasing concern (see the section on drugs and chemicals) and substan-tial restrictions are now being enforced in North America and Europe.These restrictions have significantly limited the numbers of compoundsavailable and the specific conditions under which they can be legallyused. In addition, withdrawal times for approved uses in food fish (orfish that may enter the human food chain) must be respected. Fortu-nately, several efficacious vaccines are now commercially available toprevent some of the most important bacterial diseases of fish and othersare expected in the near future. As stated earlier, the resistance of fish to infectious diseases is sig- nificantly reduced by stress; stress is often necessary for disease to occurfrom opportunistic bacterial pathogens that are commonly present inthe aquatic environment. For these diseases, hatchery management prac-tices are the difference between health and disease. The following areexamples of some bacterial diseases of cultured fish. The list is not inclu-sive, and the conscientious hatchery manager will seek advice from afish health professional to become familiar with bacterial diseases af-fecting the species of fish cultured in manger's geographic area and theapproved methods for their prevention or treatment. Flavobacterial Diseases Several important diseases are caused by long, thin (0.5 \u00d7 10 mm), gram- negative, rod-shaped bacterial pathogens of the genus Flavobacterium . While the taxonomy of this group has undergone significant revision inthe last decade, the diseases that these bacteria cause have been recog-nized for many years. Most flavobacterial species are common in theenvironment and become opportunistic pathogens when susceptible fishare present and the conditions are suitable. The nature of the diseasecaused by flavobacteria depends upon the location in the host in whichthey are growing. Some are external, causing gill diseases or externallesions, while others can result in bacteremia and systemic disease. Be-cause these bacteria are common inhabitants in soil and water, avoid-FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 581 ance of these diseases is difficult, even with a pathogen-free water sup- ply. Perhaps more than any other, these diseases are best prevented bygood hatchery management. Bacterial Gill DiseaseBacterial gill disease is a common disease of cultured trout and salmon and can result in explosive losses; it also is an occasional disease ofwarmwater and coolwater fish reared in ponds. Sudden lack of appe-tite, lethargy, flared opercula, and gathering near the surface of the wa-ter are typical signs of fish infected with bacterial gill disease. Gills showproliferation of the epithelium that may result in clubbing and fusing oflamellae or even entire filaments. The disease is greatly exacerbated bystress and by adverse water conditions, especially high ammonia levels,where mortalities can rise rapidly to 50% or greater per day. Microscopicexamination of affected gill tissue reveals long, thin bacteria arranged inthick patches over the epithelium. Necrotic gill tissue may be grayish-white, and many of the filaments may be completely eroded. The caus-ative agent is typically one of a large number of the flavobacteria, espe-cially Flavobacterium branchiophilum , that are common in the soil and water and can be isolated from diseased fish. A combination of large numbers of bacteria and gill epithelial pro- liferation differentiates bacterial gill disease from other gill problemscaused by nutritional or environmental conditions (nutritional gill dis-ease or environmental gill disease). Crowding, abrasive silt in the watersupply, and dusty starter diets are important factors that contribute tooutbreaks of the disease and may be a necessary predisposing cause insome outbreaks. Water temperatures above 12\u00b0C (53.6\u00b0F) are favorablefor the bacteria. Yearling and older fish are less susceptible than fry, butoutbreaks can be acute in all ages of fish. Bacterial gill disease is exacerbated by stress and seldom is a prob- lem among warmwater fish, particularly those being reared in earthenponds. It occasionally becomes a problem when young channel catfish,largemouth bass, bluegills, or redear sunfish are held in crowded condi-tions in tanks or troughs for extended periods. After the problem is un-der control, the fish population should be thinned or the water flow in-creased. Unless the management practice that precipitated the outbreakis corrected, bacterial gill disease will is a long, thin, gram-negative bacterium that moves in a creeping or flex-ing action and that has a peculiar habit of stacking up to form distinctivecolumns, hence the name \"columnaris.\"582 WINTON Columnaris most commonly involves external infections, but can oc- cur as an internal systemic infection with no visible external signs. Exter-nally, the disease starts as small, grayish lesions on the body, gills, or fins.The lesions rapidly increase in size and become irregular in shape. As thelesions get larger, the underlying musculature can be exposed. The mar-gins of the lesions and, occasionally, the centers may have a yellowishcolor due to large aggregations of the bacteria. Frequently, the most lethalinfections involve mouth and jaws. In Pacific salmon and warmwater fish,particularly catfish, lesions may be confined to the gills. Lesions on thegills are characterized by yellowish-brown necrotic tissue beginning atthe tip of the filaments and progressing toward the base. Columnaris disease usually is associated with some kind of stress condition such as high water temperature, low oxygen concentration,crowding, and handling. Under appropriate conditions, columnaris maytake an explosive course and cause catastrophic losses in 1-2 d after thefirst appearance of the disease. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the fishculturist to maintain the best possible environmental conditions for thefish and to minimize any stress conditions. Although columnaris disease attacks practically all species of fresh- water fish, catfish are particularly susceptible. In warmwater fish, mostoutbreaks of columnaris occur when the water temperature is above 18-20\u00b0C (64.4-68.0\u00b0F), but the disease can occur at any time of the year.Columnaris disease is common in salmonids held at water temperaturesabove 15\u00b0C (59.0\u00b0F). Progress of the disease usually is faster at the highertemperatures. Flavobacteria are common inhabitants of soil and water and com- monly are found on the surface of fishes, particularly on the gills. Thestress of crowding, handling, spawning, or holding fish at above-nor-mal temperatures, as well as the stress of external injury, facilitates thetransmission and eruption of columnaris disease. A disease resemblingcolumnaris occurs in the marine environment and is caused by Flavobac- terium maritimus . Presumptive diagnosis of columnaris is accomplished by mi- croscopic examination of wet mounts of scrapings from lesions and de-tection of many long slender bacteria that move by flexing or creepingmovements and form \"haystacks\" or \"columns.\" Preventative measures include maintenance of optimum water tem- peratures for salmonids, reduced handling during warm weather, main-tenance of the best possible environmental conditions, and avoidance ofovercrowding fish.FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 583 Bacterial Coldwater Disease Bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) or low temperature disease is one of the more common diseases of young salmonids where it produceslow to moderate mortality. The disease typically manifests itself in theform of external lesions on the dorsal surface or on the caudal peduncle,hence the name \"peduncle disease\"; however, the bacteria frequentlybecome systemic where they can invade the vertebral column and cen-tral nervous system leading to darkening and spinal deformities thatcan mimic IHN or whirling disease. As its name implies, the diseaseoccurs at low water temperatures in the range of 4-10\u00b0C (39.2-50.0\u00b0F).Affected fish become darkened, and lesions may develop on the backnear the dorsal fin, on the caudal peduncle, or on the isthmus anterior tothe pectoral fins. The caudal fin may be completely destroyed. A lesionusually starts on the caudal peduncle behind the adipose fin, where itcauses inflammation, swelling, and gradual erosion. The diseaseprogresses posteriorly and the caudal fin may be eroded. Coldwater disease is caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum. The bacterium is water borne and can be transmitted from carrier fish in thewater supply. The bacterium can also be transferred vertically from adultto progeny via the egg. The disease sometimes occurs without externalsigns and may be due to the bacterium being acquired by vertical trans-mission. Crowded conditions stimulate a disease outbreak, but are notnecessary for the disease to appear. While all salmonids (and a fewnonsalmonids) are thought to be susceptible, coho and chum salmon arethe most vulnerable and, in sac fry of these species, the yolk sac may beruptured. Typically observed in young fish during the spring when wa-ter temperatures are low, larger fish may be affected if conditions arefavorable for the disease. Efforts to develop a vaccine are underway. Gram-Negative Septicemias Many members of aeromonads), and Pseudomonadaceae (pseudomonads) cause disease in fish. Different bacterial species within these families grow optimallyat very different temperatures and typically cause disease in hosts thatare cultured at those temperatures. The diseases are typically gram-nega-tive septicemias with hemorrhagic lesions or liquifactive necrosis of or-gans. They can result in high losses. The first commercially licensed fishvaccines were developed as formalin-killed bacterial cultures (bacterins)to control some of these diseases.584 WINTON Furunculosis Furunculosis was traditionally known as a septicemic disease of salmo- nids reared in freshwater, but significant losses now occur among salmo-nids cultured in marine net-pens. The causative agent of furunculosis isAeromonas salmonicida, and virtually all trout and salmon hatcheries with open water supplies are probably exposed to the bacterium at one timeor another. Furunculosis has been reported in most salmonids of all ages.Among salmonids, brook trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, and Atlan-tic salmon are most often affected. While furunculosis is endemic in manyhatcheries, severe outbreaks are now less common due to advances infish culture, drug therapy, and use of vaccines. The disease is characterized by a generalized bacteremia with focal necrotic lesions in the muscle, often seen as swellings under the skinthat are not true \"furuncles.\" The swollen skin lesions are filled withpink fluid containing blood, and necrotic tissue may have a purple oriridescent blue color. These lesions are especially apparent in chronicinfections, but similar lesions may occur from other diseases caused bygram-negative bacteria. Hemorrhaged and frayed fins also are common.Internally, diseased fish may exhibit petechiae in the lining of the bodycavity and especially on the visceral fat. The pericardium usually is filledwith bloody fluid and is inflamed. The spleen, normally dark red in color,often will be a bright cherry-red and swollen. The lower intestine oftenis highly inflamed and a bloody discharge can be manually pressed fromthe vent. The incidence of furunculosis generally follows the seasonal tem- perature pattern with most outbreaks occurring in the warmer months.When conditions are optimal for the disease, it occurs as an acute formin which death results from massive bacteremia before gross lesions candevelop. In such outbreaks, only a few clinically sick fish may be seen atany one time in spite of the high death rate. Acute cases of furunculosishave incubation periods of 2-4 d with few apparent signs. Chronic casesusually occur at temperatures below 14\u00b0C (57.2\u00b0F) and may have an in-cubation period of one to several weeks, depending upon the water tem-perature. Latent cases may develop during low temperature periods andflare up with greater severity, displaying many typical signs, when wa-ter temperatures rise. Fish exposed to furunculosis may become carriers of the disease and nonsalmonids in the water supply should be considered likely reser-voirs of infection. Furunculosis may break out in virtually any freshwa-ter fish population, including warmwater species, if conditions such ashigh temperature and low dissolved oxygen favor the pathogen. Sanitation provides the most important long-range control of furun-FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 585 culosis. If a population of fish at a hatchery is free of furunculosis and if the water supply does not contain fish that harbor the pathogen, strictsanitation measures should be used to prevent the introduction of thedisease via incoming eggs or fish. Eggs received at a hatchery should bedisinfected upon arrival with iodophors used as recommended. Main-tenance of favorable environmental conditions for the fish is of primeimportance in preventing furunculosis outbreaks. Proper water tempera-tures, adequate dissolved oxygen, efficient waste removal, and avoid-ance of overcrowding must be observed. A presumptive diagnosis of furunculosis takes into consideration the frequency of outbreaks in a certain area, presence of typical lesions, andthe occurrence of short gram-negative rods in the lesions, kidneys, spleen,and blood. A confirmatory diagnosis can be made only after Aeromonas salmonicida has been identified as the predominant organism isolated. Drugs are effective only in the treatment of outbreaks, and drug resis- tance is a common problem. Recurrences of furunculosis are likely as longas A. salmonicida is present in the hatchery system and environmental con- ditions are suitable. In recent years, effective vaccines have been licensedfor control of furunculosis. While these vaccines are most effective whendelivered by injection in an adjuvant, among Atlantic salmon farms, thevaccines provide important protection and are highly cost-effective. In addition to salmonids, an atypical form of furunculosis has been reported in many warmwater species, mainly ornamental fish, includ-ing carp, Koi, goldfish, and eel. The disease often produces hemorrhageson the body surface that can lead to deep ulcers of the skin and muscu-lature. This atypical form of furunculosis is caused by a different sub-species of the organism and the disease is known as erythrodermatitisof carp, carp furunculosis, ulcer disease, or atypical furunculosis. Enteric RedmouthEnteric redmouth disease (ERM) refers to an infection of rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon by the gram-negative enteric bacterium Yersinia ruckeri. Yersinia ruckeri produces a systemic infection that results in marked inflammation and erosion of the jaws and palate. Trout withERM typically become sluggish and dark in color and show inflamma-tion of the mouth, opercula, isthmus, and base of fins. Reddening occursin body fat and in the posterior part of the intestine. The stomach maybecome filled with a colorless watery liquid and the intestine with ayellow fluid. This disease often produces sustained low-level mortality,but can cause large losses. Large-scale outbreaks occur if chronically in-fected fish are stressed during hauling, exposed to low dissolved oxy-gen, or exposed to other poor environmental conditions. The disease has been reported in rainbow, steelhead, and cutthroat586 WINTON trout, and coho, chinook, and Atlantic salmon. Evidence suggests that the spread of the disease is associated with the movement of infectedfish, and fish-to-fish contact provides transfer of the bacterium to healthytrout. Because spread of the disease can be linked with fish movements,the best control is avoidance of the pathogen. Fish and eggs should beobtained only from sources known to be free of ERM. This can be ac-complished by strict sanitary procedures and avoidance of carrier fish. While drug therapy has been used in the past to control ERM, the emergence of drug resistance strains of Y. ruckeri is a significant problem. Highly effective vaccines are now commercially available for the controlof ERM. These are efficiently administered by immersion vaccination offry and fingerlings providing cost-effective protection for fish in waterscontaining the bacterium. These bacterins produce long-term immunityand should be viewed as the recommended method for control. Motile Aeromonas SepticemiaMotile aeromonas septicemia (MAS) is a ubiquitous disease of many freshwater fish species and is typically caused by one of several, gram-negative, motile bacteria that are members of the genus Aeromonas. Some of the species frequently isolated in outbreaks are A. hydrophila, A. sobria, and A. caviae. Occasionally, various species of pseudomonads, especially Pseudomonas fluorescens, can cause an indistinguishable form of the dis- ease. A definitive diagnosis of MAS can be made only if the causativeagent is isolated and identified because the signs of MAS can be easilyconfused with several other diseases. When present, the most common signs of MAS are superficial circu- lar or irregular grayish-red ulcerations with inflammation and erosionin and around the mouth as in ERM. Fish may have a distended abdo-men filled with a slightly opaque or bloody fluid (dropsy) orexophthalmia if fluid accumulates behind the eyeball. Other fish, min-nows in particular, may have furuncles like those in furunculosis, whichmay erupt to the surface, producing deep necrotic craters. Fins also maybe inflamed. In addition to the presence of fluid in the abdominal cavity, the kid- ney may be swollen and soft and the liver may become pale or greenish.Petechiae may be present in the peritoneum and musculature. The lowerintestine and vent often are swollen and inflamed and may contain bloodycontents or discharge. The intestine usually is free of food, but may befilled with yellow mucus. Motile aeromonas septicemia occasionally takes an acute form in warmwater fish, and severe losses can occur even though fish show few,if any, clinical signs of the disease. In general, most outbreaks in warmwaterfish are in the spring and summer, but the disease may occur at any timeFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 587 of year. Temperature is very important. Largemouth bass and channel catfish are susceptible particularly during spawning and during the sum-mer if stressed by handling, crowding, or low oxygen concentrations.Aquarium fish can develop the disease at any time of the year. Amongsalmonids, rainbow trout seem to be the most susceptible and outbreaksare associated with handling stress and crowding of fish. Fish and frogsthat recover from the disease usually become carriers and may contami-nate water supplies if not removed. The disease has been identifiedthroughout the world and apparently infects virtually any species of fresh-water fish under conditions favoring the bacteria. Observation of strict sanitary practices and the elimination of pos- sible carrier fish from the water supply are extremely important to thecontrol of MAS at trout and salmon hatcheries. For warmwater fish, ev-erything possible should be done to avoid stressing the fish during warmweather. Because of the many types of bacteria associated with MAS, itis unlikely that a vaccine will be developed in the near future. Also, dueto the common occurrence of drug resistance, therapeutic drug treat-ments cannot be assumed to be effective. Enteric Septicemia of CatfishEnteric septicemia of catfish (ESC) or edwardsiellosis is caused by the bacterium Edwardsiella ictaluri. It is one of the most important infectious disease problems in the commercial catfish industry in the southernUnited States. Most reported cases of ESC occur among channel catfish,but the bacterium has been isolated from white catfish, yellow bullhead,black bullhead, and brown bullhead. Enteric septicemia of catfish hasalso been reported from Clarias batrachus in Thailand and from several ornamental species, and the susceptibility of other species, includingsalmonids, has been shown experimentally. Edwardsiella ictaluri should not be confused with E. tarda , another member of the same genus that is frequently found in aquatic animals and is responsible for opportunisticinfections in fish and mammals, including humans. Acute outbreaks of ESC occur within a limited temperature range, from 18 to 28\u00b0C (64.4 to 82.4\u00b0F). Low-level mortality due to ESC canoccur in carrier populations outside of this temperature range. This re-sults in seasonal fluctuations, spring and autumn being the critical peri-ods. Other environmental factors (water quality, organic compounds,stocking density, and stress factors) are likely to modulate the virulenceof the agent In spite of these characteristics, E. ictaluri is generally con- sidered to be a true obligate pathogen. Clinical signs may differ according to the fish species. Two clinical forms of ESC have been described. The infection seems to begin mostoften in the olfactory sacs through the nasal route and to progress slowly588 WINTON upward generating granulomatous inflammation in brain tissues. This chronic meningoencephaIitis can account for behavioral manifestationswith alternating listlessness and chaotic swimming. In late stages of thisdisease manifestation, \"hole in the head\" is observed\u2014an ulcerationdeveloping from the inside through the dorsocranial part of the headexposing the brain. Although general infection can result from suchchronic forms, it is more often associated with acute septicemia follow-ing infection through the enteric route. It has been demonstrated that E. ictaluri can cross the intestinal mucosa very easily. Then, as in many other bacteremias, skin petechial hemorrhages are observed around the mouth,on the throat, and at the base of the fins. Multifocal distinct 2-mm diam-eter, raised, hemorragic cutaneous lesions that progress to depigmentedulcers also occur. Anemia, moderate gill inflammation and exophthalmiaare common signs. Internally, hemorrhages and necrotic foci are scat-tered in the liver and internal organs. Hemorrhagic enteritis, sys-temic edema, accumulation of ascitic fluid in the body cavity, and en-largement of the spleen are nonspecific signs. Histological examinationreveals a systemic infection of all organs and skeletal muscles with dif-fuse granulomatosis. Fish that recover from ESC generally remain infected, even though protective immunity and circulating antibodies can be clearly evidenced.Edwardsiella ictaluri has been detected in the kidney of such fish well over 4 months after exposure, suggesting that carrier fish act as the naturalreservoir for the organism. It is believed that shedding with feces is themain means of dissemination into the environment. The pathogen per-sistence and the common practice of continual partial harvest and stock-ing within a production pond have contributed to the success of thispathogen and the prevalence of ESC in the industry. Moreover, the agentcan survive in pond sediments for an extended period of time, and thismay be another important factor in disease recurrence in given areas. Enteric septicemia of catfish may be controlled through chemo- therapy or prophylactic measures. The most common antimicrobial treat-ments are oral application potentiated sulfonamide (sulfadimethoxine-ormethoprim) or oxytetracycline, but plasmid-mediated resistance tothese antibiotics has developed recently and many producers are nowfocusing on alternative methods to reduce losses. This relies on manage-ment to reduce stress in fish and on vaccination, which has shown prom-ise and remains an active area of research. A related enteric organism, Edwardsiella tarda , also causes mild to severe disease in catfish and among salmonids at warmer temperatures.In catfish, the disease progresses from small cutaneous lesions to largeabscesses filled with necrotic tissue, a condition termed \"emphysema-FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 589 tous putrefactive disease\" which indicates the foul smell occurring in fish affected by the disease. In addition to the potential to cause diseasein many fish species reared in warm water, the agent is capable of infect-ing humans. Control methods for E. tarda are similar to those used for E. ictaluri . Because E. tarda is not an obligate pathogen and is relatively common in the environment, it is difficult to eliminate the infection fromopen ponds. VibriosisVibriosis is a systemic disease of marine, estuarine, and (occasionally) freshwater fishes. It is known also under the names of red pest, red boil,red plague, or salt water furunculosis. Many species of vibrios have beenisolated from diseased fish; however, the most upon causative species, vibriosis can occur any time of year,even in water temperatures as low as 4\u00b0C (39.2\u00b0F; coldwater vibriosis).However, it is most prevalent in the temperate zones during the warmersummer months, and outbreaks can be expected when water tempera-tures reach 15\u00b0C (59.0\u00b0F). Signs of the disease usually do not become evident until the fish have been in salt water for 2 weeks or more under crowded conditions.Diminished feeding activity is one of the first noticeable signs. Lethargicfish gather around the edges of holding units; others swim in erratic,spinning patterns. Diseased fish have hemorrhages around the bases oftheir pectoral and anal fins or bloody discharge from the vent. When afish is opened for necropsy, diffuse pinpoint hemorrhages of the intesti-nal wall and liver may be evident. The spleen frequently is enlarged andmay be two to three times its normal size. Vibriosis is worldwide in its distribution and virtually all species of marine and estuarine fishes are susceptible. Among salmonids, pinksalmon and chum salmon are the most susceptible, but serious outbreakshave occurred in coho salmon, rainbow trout, and Atlantic salmon.Stresses associated with handling, low oxygen, and elevated tempera-ture can predispose fish to vibriosis. Vibrios are ubiquitous in marineand brackish waters and infections probably are waterborne and maybe spread by contact. Salmonids usually die within a week after expo-sure. Fish of all ages are susceptible. Diagnosis of vibriosis requires isolation of a slightly curved, gram- negative, motile, rod-shaped bacterium on salt-containing medium. Theorganism may be identified by serological or biochemical reactions. Thereis no reliable presumptive diagnosis of vibriosis because of its similarityto other gram-negative septicemias.590 WINTON Prevention of vibriosis depends on good sanitation, no crowding, and minimal handling stress. While drug therapy has been used in thepast to control vibriosis, drug resistance is a problem. Highly effectivevaccines are now commercially available for the control of vibriosis andwere the first commercially licensed vaccines for fish. These vaccines areefficiently administered by immersion vaccination and result in signifi-cant economic benefit. These bacterins produce long-term protection andshould be viewed as the recommended method for control. Bacterial Kidney Disease Bacterial kidney disease (BKD) is a chronic insidious infection of salmo-nid fish. The disease is slow to develop, but once established, it may bedifficult to control and virtually impossible to cure. The causative diplobacillus. The course of kidney disease is that of a chronic bacteremia. Once the pathogen enters the fish, either from vertical transmission through theegg or from contact with other infected fish in the water supply, the bacte-ria multiply slowly within macrophages and other cells. Foci of infectiondevelop in the kidney and in other organs such as the liver, spleen, andheart. White cellular debris collects in blisters, and ulcers that develop inthese organs are seen easily. Lesions developing in the posterior kidneyare easiest to spot and may reach a centimeter or more in diameter. Somelesions extend into the musculature and result in externally visible blis-ters under the skin. If the disease has reached the stage in which grosslesions are apparent, therapeutic treatment has little effect. Bacterial kidney disease has been found in many species of salmo- nids in North America. A tendency toward seasonal periodicity has beennoted, but the incidence varies at different hatcheries. Brook trout andchinook, chum, pink, and sockeye salmon are highly susceptible. Infectedor carrier fish are considered to be sources of infection. Experimentally,from 1 to 3 months will elapse before mortality begins, depending uponthe route of administration. Vertical transmission via the egg has beenproven and is an important source of infection. Such infections withinthe egg are impossible to eliminate via iodophor treatment of eggs. Historically, diagnosis of BKD has been based on the demonstration of small, gram-positive diplobacilli in infected tissues. More recently, se-rological procedures such as fluorescent antibody techniques and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have become widely used and are consid-ered more reliable. Molecular methods such as the PCR assay have beenpublished and will probably become standard methods in the future. Control methods for BKD rely upon reducing hatchery conditionsFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 591 that exacerbate disease and in reducing the infection levels among broodstock. Complete avoidance of R. salmoninarum has proven diffi- cult because the bacterium is present at subclinical levels in many stocksof salmonids and is transmitted intra ovum . Thus, only the most highly sensitive detection methods have been successful at identifying andavoiding infected broodstock (broodstock segregation). Drug treatmentis typically only effective in delaying mortality and not in eliminatinginfections. Among hatcheries rearing salmonids, low-level infectionsshould be anticipated; however, should a serious outbreak occur, strictquarantine and eradication measures are recommended. The develop-ment of vaccines against BKD remains an active area of research. Piscirickettsiosis Piscirickettsiosis is a disease of salmonids caused by Piscirickettsia salmonis, a gram-negative, highly fastidious, intracellular bacterial patho- gen of fish. Thus far, the disease has been described from Chile, Ireland,Norway, and both the west and east coasts of North America. Piscirickett- sia salmonis has been detected in coho salmon, chinook salmon, sakura salmon, rainbow trout, pink salmon, and Atlantic salmon. Coho salmonare believed to be most susceptible. The first evidence of disease may be the appearance of small white lesions or shallow hemorrhagic ulcers on the skin. Affected fish appeardark and lethargic, hanging at the net sides. The major gross pathologicalchanges are gill pallor, peritonitis, ascites, an enlarged spleen, a swollengray kidney, and a liver with large pale necrotic lesions. The mechanismsof transmission are not completely understood. The disease has been pri-marily reported in marine fish farms, but has also been observed in fresh-water facilities. Horizontal transmission in salt water and freshwater hasbeen demonstrated. Transmission by vectors remains a consideration, andthe role of vertical transmission is presently under investigation. The identification of P . salmonis is based on isolation of the causative agent in cell culture with subsequent testing for characteristics of rick-ettsiae. P. salmonis occurs in cytoplasmic vacuoles in the host cell. The identity of P . salmonis isolated in cell culture or observed in smears from diseased tissue may be confirmed by means of the fluorescent antibodytest using type-specific antiserum. Molecular diagnostic methods usingthe PCR have been developed. The implementation of hygienic measures and sound management policies are the only control methods currently available. Eggs may bedisinfected as part of good hatchery practice, and elimination of infectedstocks may be of some use unless the fish are continually exposed to592 WINTON carriers present in the marine environment. Although antibacterial treat- ment provides some benefit, it is not entirely effective as a means ofcontrolling the disease, and the emergence of drug resistance has beenreported to be an increasing problem. Intensive efforts are underway byvarious groups to develop an effective vaccine. Mycobacteriosis Mycobacteriosis of fish is typically a chronic, granulomatous disease thatis caused by one of several freshwater or marine species of mycobacte-ria, including Mycobacterium fortuitum, M. chelonae, or M. marinum. The disease is important both from a fish health perspective and becausethese bacteria are zoonotic agents capable of causing disease in humans. Mycobacteriosis is usually seen in fish reared in temperate condi- tions, and outbreaks have been reported in striped bass, sea bass, seabream, cod, red drum, mackerel, tilapia, and salmonids. Clinical signsinclude lethargy, skin discoloration, popeye, and a distended abdomen.Internally, grayish to white nodular lesions are typically observed in theliver, spleen, or kidney. Mortality is typically chronic and unrelenting.Occasionally, the disease assumes an acute fulminating form with ex-tensive necrosis of internal organs. Diagnosis is by observation of acid-fast organisms in the lesions or by culture on special media. There is no effective therapy or vaccine forcontrol of this disease. Removal of fish and complete disinfection of fa-cilities are the only control options. Streptococcal Infections In the United States, Streptococcus iniae is responsible for significant losses in tilapia, striped bass, and other warmwater species. In freshwater spe-cies, it produces an acute disease characterized as meningitis (in trout)and meningoencephalitis (in tilapines). In the marine species red drum,infections are characterized as an acute to subacute disease with mul-tiple necrotic lesions affecting the skin and internal organs. Bacteria havebeen found in both diseased and asymptomatic fish. S. iniae is consid- ered a zoonotic agent capable of infecting humans, causing a localizedform of cellulitis; cases have been identified in the United States andCanada. The slow growth and similarity of S. iniae to other species of gram- positive cocci complicate identification by conventional methods, andPCR assays have been developed. Formalin-killed bacterins have beentested in the laboratory and in the field. Further research on vaccine de-velopment is ongoing.FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 593 Parasitic Diseases of Fish Parasites probably cause more disease problems in fish culture than any other type of fish pathogen. It is common to find parasites of many taxo-nomic classes in or on wild fish, and fish reared under intensive condi-tions rarely are without some parasites. When present in small num-bers, they usually produce no obvious damage and are of limited concern;however, under intensive rearing conditions, parasite numbers can buildup rapidly, leading to problems. Here, vigilance is important. If prob-lems can be anticipated and effective measures taken early, parasite lossesmay be moderated, but under adverse conditions, parasites, even nor-mally benign ones, can result in high mortality. Traditionally, parasites are identified or classified by microscopic observation of morphological features using fresh or fixed material. Morerecently, the application of molecular techniques has revealed differencesamong parasites with similar morphologies, as well as the identity ofparasites previously thought to be entirely different organisms. Thesemethods have also been used to develop more rapid methods for confir-mation of a few parasitic diseases that formerly had to be diagnosed bymore labor-intensive means, including histology. While, literally, thousands of species within the many parasite genera affecting fish have been described, only a few examples of those appear-ing commonly and of major importance to fish husbandry are presentedbelow. It should be remembered that almost all species of parasites cancause problems if allowed to reach very high levels, but, typically, signifi-cant losses due to parasites are usually a sign of inattention to good hatch-ery practices. Over time, hatchery managers should become familiar withthe types of parasites that can present problems for the species being rearedat a given location. In general, the same problems will occur routinely andcan be anticipated. Because many parasites can be identified with the aidof a simple light microscope, the progressive hatchery manager will beproactive in examining fish in order to take appropriate action or to seekearly assistance from a fish health professional. Dinoflagellates Dinoflagellates are protozoans that occur frequently in the aquatic envi-ronment. Some produce potent toxins that have caused mass mortalitiesamong fish. While most are free living or parasites of invertebrates, sev-eral have been reported to cause disease in fish, including Amyloodinium and members of several related genera . Amyloodinium is a serious parasite of fish living in warmwater ma- rine and brackish waters. It occurs worldwide and has been associated594 WINTON with large losses of both cultured and wild fishes. The disease caused by Amyloodinium is often referred to as marine velvet disease; the parasite affects the gills and skin causing a dusty or velvety appearance. Deathoccurs by suffocation in heavy infestations of the gills. Most species ofmarine are and amoebas are produce external and internal infections of many vertebrates, includ-ing fish. The best known fish pathogens of the group include species ofCryptobia, Hexamita, Ichthyobodo, Trypanosoma, several amoebas. Hexamita is flagellated protozoan found in the in- testine of salmonids of all ages and occasionally of ornamental fish andgrass carp. Infection can occur at all temperatures and results in poorgrowth and elevated mortality in small fish. All species of salmonids aresusceptible to infection. Because there are no well-defined signs, a diag-nosis of hexamitiasis must be made by microscopic examination of gutcontents from the anterior portion of the intestine and pyloric caeca. Theflagellates are minute, colorless, pear-shaped organisms that dart rap-idly in every direction. Gross signs of infected fish may include nervousbehavior, including swimming in a cork-screw pattern and a dark ema-ciated condition. Species of Ichthyobodo (formerly Costia ) are very small flagellated ectoparasites easily missed during routine microscopic examinations ofgills and body scrapings. These protozoans are free-swimming, moveby means of long flagella, and are about 5 \u00d7 12 \u00b5m in size. Two species, Ichthyobodo pyriformis and I. necatrix, are commonly seen and produce \"blue slime\" disease of fish. The characteristic blue slime or bluish sheenis caused by increased mucus production in response to irritation. Virtu-ally all species of fish are susceptible at all water temperatures. An early sign of an Ichtyobodo infection is a drop in appetite of the fish and a general listlessness. \"Flashing\" may be evident if the skin isinfected, but only rarely if just the gills are involved. Signs of the diseasesometimes are mistaken for bacterial gill disease. Heavily infected fishoften develop a bluish slime over the entire body; however, fish less than3 or 4 months old may die before this condition develops. Ichtyobodo can be a serious problem on all species and sizes of warmwater fish, particularly channel catfish. This flagellate can causeproblems any time of year, but is most common on warmwater fish fromFebruary to April in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections with the para-FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 595 site can be treated, but prevention through improved hygiene, adequate water flows, and continuous vigilance is typically a better choice. Ciliates Among the more that 7,000 species of ciliated protozoans are a few Trichophyra . Infections are typically external and have been successfully treated with a variety of chemicals. Theseparasites affect a wide range of fish species and typically do limited harm.When mortality occurs, it is usually a result of adverse conditions thatstress the fish making them more susceptible to infection. Ichthyophihirius multifilis , also termed white spot or \"Ich,\" is a large ciliated protozoan exclusively parasitic on fish. It causes serious diseasein catfish, but also is a common parasite of other warmwater fishes andcan be a problem for ornamental fish and salmonids. Ich can be seen bythe naked eye; when fully grown it may be as large as 1.0 mm in diam-eter and appears as gray-white grains of salt. Positive identification isbased on the finding of a large, ciliated protozoan, with a horseshoe-shaped macronucleus, embedded in gills, skin, or fin tissue. The feeding stages, or trophozoites, of Ich are found in the epithe- lium of the skin, fins, and gills. When mature, the adult parasites dropoff the host and attach to the bottom or sides of the pond. Once encysted,they reproduce by multiple fission and, within 2 to several days, de-pending upon temperature, each adult may produce up to 1,000 ciliatedtomites. Upon contact with the fish, the tomites penetrate the skin andbegin to feed and grow into adults. At optimal temperatures of 20-23\u00b0C(68.0-73.4\u00b0F), the life cycle may take as few as 3-4 d. The cycle requires 2weeks at 15\u00b0C (59.0\u00b0F), more than 5 weeks at 10\u00b0C (50.0\u00b0F), and monthsat lower temperatures. Ich is known as and pepper\" and \"white spot\" disease by aquar- ists because of the gray-white specks that appear on the skin. However,in some species of warmwater fish, Ich is found almost exclusively onthe gills. On rare occasions, Ich infections on catfish also may be restrictedto the gills. In severe outbreaks, losses may precede the appearance ofthe mature parasites on the fish. Young fish exhibit considerable flash-ing off the bottom and often show erratic spurts of activity, jumping outof the water and thrashing about due to irritation caused by the para-sites. Successful treatment of Ich depends upon the elimination of para-site stages that are free in the water and the prevention of reinfection.Tomites and adult parasites leaving the fish are, therefore, the target oftherapeutic efforts.596 WINTON The best control for Ich, as for any disease, is prevention. Hatchery water supplies always should be kept free of fish. If possible, anywarmwater fish brought onto a hatchery should be quarantined for atleast 1 week at 20\u00b0C (68.0\u00b0F) and coldwater fish for at least 2 weeks at15\u00b0C (59.0\u00b0F) to determine if they are infested with Ich. Ich is more difficult to treat because the encysted forms are resistant to treatment; only the free-swimming forms are vulnerable. Successfultreatment usually is long and expensive. There are several pond treat-ments for either warmwater fish or salmonids that can be used success-fully if started in time. Species of Chilodonella are small, oval, colorless protozoans, 50-70 \u00b5m long, which may be found in vast numbers on the skin, fins, andgills of virtually all species of fish at all water temperatures. Under highmagnification, faint bands of cilia can be seen over much of the organ-ism. The parasite primarily affects weakened fish and is a significantproblem for warmwater fish during the winter when lower tempera-tures suppress host resistance. Heavily infected fish are listless, produceexcessive mucus, do not feed actively, and may flash. Mortality is oftenassociated with heavy gill infestations. Trichodinids are saucer-shaped protozoans with cilia around the margins of their body. These protozoans live on the skin, fins, and gillsof fish and, when abundant, cause severe irritation and continual flash-ing. Salmon yearlings, if left untreated, develop a tattered appearance.Secondary bacterial infections may develop in untreated cases. Species of Trichophrya sometimes are found on the gills of fish and can cause serious problems in catfish and occasionally in otherwarmwater species. They have rounded to pyramid-shaped bodies (30\u00d7 50 mm) and are distinguished by food-catching tentacles in the adult stage. Live organisms have a characteristic yellowish-orange or yellow-ish-brown color that makes them very conspicuous when wet mounts ofgill tissue are examined using a microscope. Affected fish gills are paleand clubbed and may be eroded. Infected fish will be listless, as if theywere suffering from an oxygen deficiency. Microsporidia Microsopridia are intracellular protozoan parasites characterized, as theirname implies, by the production of very small spores. Species within 11genera affect a wide variety of fish worldwide; the most significant onesare Pleistophora, Enterocytozoon, Glugea, species of Pleistophora infect hatchery fish. Pleistophora spores are about the size of large bacteria, 3-6 mm long and somewhat beanFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 597 shaped. Severe infections have been reported in the gills of rainbow trout and in the ovaries of golden shiners. In golden shiners, the parasitesinfest up to about half of the ovary and significantly reduce the fecun-dity of broodstock populations. The only known control for Pleistophora is prevention. Rainbow trout or their eggs should not be transferred from infected to uninfected hatch-eries. Broodstocks known to be infected should be phased out and therearing facilities disinfected. Because there are few stocks of golden shin-ers free of Pleistophora ovariae, proper management is the best answer to this problem. The severity of infections increases with age, so only 1-year-old broodstock should be used and all older fish destroyed. Myxosporea The family Myxosporea is a large and important group of parasites, mostof which occur in fish. More than 1,250 species have been described frommarine, brackish, and freshwater fish species worldwide. Many speciesof Myxosporea have a narrow host range, but others can affect severalspecies of fish within a family (e.g., whirling disease in salmonids). Aninteresting feature of the myxosporeans is the presence of alternatinghosts in the life cycle of several species that have been studied exten-sively. In addition to the fish, an invertebrate host (e.g., a tubificid wormin the case of whirling disease) is an essential part of the life cycle pro-ducing the actinospore that infects causative agent of whirling disease, a serious condition of both wild and hatchery-reared salmonids. The disease wasinitially endemic in central and western Europe, but has been spread bymovement of infected fish to several other countries including the UnitedStates. The obvious sign of tail chasing (whirling) becomes evident about40-60 d after infection and is caused by erosion of the cranial cartilage,particularly around the organ of equilibrium, by the trophozoite stageof the parasite. In general, only trout less than a few months old wheninfected go on to exhibit whirling disease because cartilage becomes os-sified after a few months making the fish more resistant to neural dam-age. However, older fish can become infected even though they show noclinical signs. Mortality has varied greatly among outbreaks, sometimesminor, sometimes devastating. The severity of disease among wild and598 WINTON hatchery fish has been shown to be related to the dose received and the age of the fish at infection. The complete life cycle of M. cerebralis has been established and in- volves an alternate host, the aquatic oligochaete worm Tubifex tubifex . Triactinomyxon spores released by the worm infect the fish skin wherethe sporoplasm leaves the spore, develops into the trophozoite, and mi-grates to the developing cartilage where it sporulates to form the typicalmyxospores observed in diagnostic examinations. External signs alone are not adequate for diagnosis of M. cerebralis infections as the signs mimic those of several other conditions includingBCWD and IHN. Traditionally, verification required labor-intensive iden-tification of the myxospore stage in the cartilage of fish heads, a stagethat does not appear until several months after infection. The myxosporesare ovoidal (front view) or lenticular (in profile), and have two pyriformpolar capsules containing filaments at the anterior end. The diagnosis ofwhirling disease and detection of M. cerebralis in both the fish and worm host has been aided greatly by the development of a PCR assay. Because of the seriousness of whirling disease for both hatchery and wild fish, control and treatment measures must be rigorous. Infectedfish should not be stocked and earthen rearing units should be convertedto concrete. Hatcheries where whirling disease has occurred should besubjected to complete disinfection of facilities and equipment with highconcentrations of such chemicals as sodium hypochlorite or calciumoxide. Allow the treated area to stand for 4 weeks, clean thoroughly, andrepeat disinfection. New eggs or fry should be obtained from a knownuncontaminated source and raised in spore-free ponds or raceways pro-vided with a pathogen-free water supply. HenneguyaSeveral species of Henneguya have been described from a wide variety of North American freshwater fishes. Henneguya infections are histozoic and localize in specific tissues. Infections may appear as white cystswithin the gills, barbels, adipose fins, skin, the head, subcutaneous tissues, or sclera and muscles of the eye. Spores of Henneguya grossly resemble spermatozoa; they possess two anterior polar capsules and an elongate posterior process that may ormay not separate along the sutural plane. Henneguya salminicola has been found in cysts in the body or musculature of coho, pink, and chinooksalmon. Chum salmon also are subject to infection. In channel catfish, Henneguya infections are categorized with respect to the tissue parasitized and the site of spore formation. An intralamellarbronchial form develops cysts within gill lamellae. A cutaneous formcauses large lesions or pustules within the subcutaneous layers and un-FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 599 derlying musculature of the skin; a granulomatous form causes large tumor-like lesions. An integumentary form causes white cysts on theexternal body surface. A gallbladder form develops within that organand may obstruct the bile duct. An adipose fin form localizes solely withinthe tissue of that fin. The interlamellar form of Henneguya develops spores within basal cells between gill lamellae. This form, in contrast to the intralamellarform, has caused large losses among very young channel catfish. Mor-talities of 95% or more among fingerlings less than 2 weeks old havebeen reported. Loss of respiratory function accompanies acute infections.Fish exhibit signs of anoxia, swimming at the surface of ponds with flaredgill opercula. Infected fish are unable to tolerate handling. Most attemptsto treat with parasiticides have resulted in additional losses. As with other myxosporean infections, prevention is the only con- trol measure because no chemical treatment is effective. The disease hasbeen spread from hatchery to hatchery with shipments of infected fin-gerlings. Confirmation of the interlamellar form in a catfish populationmay warrant destruction of the infected fish and disinfection of the rear-ing facilities involved. CeratomyxaCeratomyxa shasta is a serious myxosporean parasite of salmonids in western North America that causes severe losses of rainbow trout, steel-head, and chinook salmon. Heavy mortalities of adult salmon have oc-curred just before spawning, and outbreaks have been reported amongsome wild salmonid populations. Natural infections also have been foundin cutthroat, brook, and brown trout, and in chum, coho, pink, sockeye,and Atlantic salmon. The natural life cycle is now known to involve thefreshwater polychaete worm Manayunkia speciosa , which releases the actinosporean stage that infects fish. The spores of C. shasta are elongated and found in great numbers in the gut and in cysts in the liver, kidney, spleen, and muscle of infectedfish. The disease is contracted by adult salmon upon entering infectedfreshwater and by outmigrating juveniles passing through an area wherethe infective stage is present. The first signs of infection include lack ofappetite, listlessness, and movement to slack water. The fish may darken,shed fecal casts, and the abdomen swell with ascites. Exophthalmia of-ten occurs. The first internal changes appear as small, whitish, opaqueareas in the tissue of the large intestine. As the disease progresses, theentire intestine becomes swollen and hemorrhagic. Mortality generallyoccurs at water temperatures greater than 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F). There is no known treatment for C. shasta ; however, significant dif-600 WINTON ferences have been shown in the susceptibility of various stocks of salmo- nids to infection. Water supplies known to harbor infected fish shouldnot be used for hatchery purposes without pretreatment unless such re-sistant stocks are used. The diagnosis of C. shasta infections in salmo- nids relies upon the observation of the typical kidney bean shaped ma-ture spores in wet mounts or histological sections. Recently, thedevelopment of a PCR assay has greatly facilitated the diagnosis of C. shasta infections, especially the pre-spore stages. Proliferative Gill DiseaseIn farmed channel catfish alevins, a condition known as \"hamburger gill\" or proliferative gill disease causes large losses. The parasite S. ictaluri , once suggested to be a species of Sphaerospora , normally sporulates in the kidney; however, the presence of the pre-spore stages in the gill causea strong inflammatory response, leading to necrosis of the gill cartilageand hyperplasia of the gill epithelium. When conditions favor the para-site, high mortality can occur from massive loss of gill function. Initialsigns are usually loss of appetite and listlessness with increased suscep-tibility to low oxygen levels. As the infection proceeds, cyst-like lesionscan be seen on the gills with the naked eye, giving the gill a characteris-tic appearance. The disease is most severe in catfish ponds at 16-20\u00b0C(60.8-68\u00b0F). Proliferative Kidney DiseaseA condition known as proliferative kidney disease (PKD) affects rain- bow trout and steelhead, as well as chinook and coho salmon. Infectionof fish by the pre-spore stages of the causative parasite, termed PKX,causes massive swelling of the kidney. The disease appears to be an in-flammatory response to the parasite; it typically develops in the spring.Mortality is directly affected by water temperature and can be excep-tionally high. Initial clinical signs are a swollen abdomen from the highlyswollen kidney tissues. Infected fish appear to be more susceptible tosecondary infections with bacterial or other pathogens in the water. Theinflammatory response leads to a chronic granulomatous response andnecrosis of kidney tubules; in severe infections, other organs may alsobecome necrotic. Fish surviving the disease may become normal whenwater temperatures subside; these fish are then resistant to reinfection.The disease has now been shown to be caused by a Tetracapsula species having a bryozoan host. Because mature spores are rarely observed inrainbow trout, some have suggested this species is an abnormal host.FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 601 Monogenetic Trematodes Monogenetic trematode parasites of fish can complete their life cycles on fish without involving other species of animals. Although most aretoo small to be seen by the naked eye, some species may reach 5 mm inlength. The posterior organ of attachment, the \"haptor,\" is used in iden-tification of different genera and species. There often are marginalhooklets around the margin of the haptor and either zero, two, or fourlarge anchor hooks. Species of the family Gyrodactylidae generally are found on the body and fins of fish, rarely on the gills. These parasites move around freely.The members of this family give birth to live young similar in appear-ance to the adults. Gyrodactylus can be identified by the developing em- bryo inside the adult, as well as by their lack of eye spots. The haptorhas 2 large anchor hooks and 16 marginal hooklets. Diagnosis is madefrom microscopic examination of wet mounts of fin tissue or skinscrapings. The parasites may occur in large numbers and cause skin irri-tation and lesions. Fish with large numbers of Gyrodactylus may appear listless, have frayed fins, and flash frequently. In ponds, they may gatherin shallow water in dense schools. Dactylogyrus is but one genus of several dactylogyrids commonly found on the gills of warmwater fish. These worms are particularly seri-ous parasites of cyprinids. Dactylogyrus, a small gill parasite, can be iden- tified by the presence of 4 eye spots, 1 pair of anchor hooks, and 16 mar-ginal hooklets. No embryos will be found internally, as these worms layeggs. These parasites feed on blood and can cause serious damage to thegills of warmwater fish when numerous. Clinical signs easily can be mis-taken for those caused by an oxygen deficiency or other gill infections. Cleidodiscus spp. is common on the gills of catfish and a variety of other warmwater fish species. Like Dactylogyrus, it has eye spots, but has four large anchor hooks and lays eggs, which may be seen withinthe adult worm. Cleidodiscus is found only on the gills where, when nu- merous, it causes respiratory problems by severely damaging the tissue.Signs of infection, therefore, are those of gill damage and may be similarto those seen when oxygen is low. Digenetic Trematodes Digenetic trematodes require one or more animal hosts, in addition tofish, to complete their life cycles. These parasites can be divided intotwo major groups: (1) those that live in fish as adults, producing eggsthat leave the fish to continue the life cycle, and (2) those that penetrate602 WINTON the skin of the fish and live in the fish as larvae, usually encysted in the tissue, until the fish is eaten by the final host. Blood flukes Sanguinicola davisi live as adults in arterioles of the gill arches of salmonids and other fish species. These tiny worms lay eggsthat become trapped in the capillary beds of the gills and other organs,where they develop into miracidia, which have a characteristic dark eyespot. When fully developed, the ciliated miracidia burst from the gill tobe eaten by an operculate snail, the only intermediate host in the lifecycle. Cercaria emerge from the snail and penetrate fish to complete thecycle. Control of blood flukes is difficult. It depends upon either con-tinual treatment of infected water supplies to kill the cercaria or eradica-tion of intermediate host snails. In most cases, however, blood flukes aredebilitating, but not the cause of serious losses of fish. It is conceivablethat large numbers of miracidia leaving the gill at one time could causea significant loss of blood and damage to the gills. Eggs and developingmiracidia also interfere with the circulation of blood in the gill capillar-ies and in the capillary beds of the kidney and liver. Copepods Most copepods in freshwater and salt water are an important part of thenormal diet of fish. Certain species, however, are parasitic on fish andthe sites of their attachment may become ulcerated and provide accessfor secondary infections by fungi and bacteria. Crowded hatchery rear-ing units provide ideal conditions for infestations by copepods becauseof the dense fish populations and rich environmental conditions. Argulus spp. have been given the common name of fish lice because of their ability to creep about over the surface of the fish. On first glance,they look like a scale, but on closer examination, are seen to be saucershaped and flattened against the side of the fish. They have jointed legsand two large sucking discs for attachment, which may give them theappearance of having large eyes. Argulids have an oral stylet that piercesthe skin of the host fish. They then inject a cytolytic substance and feed onblood. If these organisms become abundant, even large fish may be killed. Lernaea spp. are most commonly found on warmwater fish. How- ever, one species, L. elegans, lacks host specificity and even attacks frogs and salamanders. Heavy infestations have caused massive mortality incarp and goldfish populations. The parasite penetrates beneath scalesand causes a lesion at the point of attachment. The damage caused isassociated with loss of blood and exposure to secondary infections byfungi, bacteria, and possibly viruses. Lernaea are long (5-22 mm) slender copepods that, when attached, give the appearance of a soft sticks withFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 603 two egg sacs attached at the distal ends. Actually, the head end is buried in the flesh. This end has large, horn-like appendages that aid in identi-fication of the parasite. Fungal Diseases of Fish Fungi are common in the aquatic environment and are frequently encoun-tered by all fishes at one time or another during their lives. Under culturalconditions, certain fungi can be particularly troublesome. Species of Acklya, Aphanomyces, Branchiomyces, Leptomitus, Phoma, Pythium, and Saprolegnia have been as pathogens. These fungi grow on many types ofdecaying organic matter and are widespread in nature. Fungi infestingfish or eggs generally are considered to be secondary invaders of tissuesdamaged by injury; but once they start growing, fungi may spread tohealthy tissues and can cause death. Fungi often attack dead fish eggs andwill typically spread to the adjacent live eggs, killing them. Species of the family Saprolegniaceae affect both fish and fish eggs. In fish, Saprolegnia parasitica (or other species) is typically a secondary invader of tissues damaged by trauma, infectious disease, or poor envi-ronmental conditions. Conditions that suppress the fish's normal im-mune response (e.g., spawning in adult Pacific salmon or holdingwarmwater fish in cold water) also can render fish more susceptible tofungal infections. Winter saprolegniosis of catfish is a good example ofthe latter. The presence of Saprolegnia infections on fish or fish eggs is noted by a white to off-white, cottony growth. This growth consists of a mass ofhyphal filaments; these hold the sporangia containing flagellatedzoospores that escape to begin infections on other fish or eggs. Unlesscontrol measures are taken, the expanding growth ultimately may coverthe entire surface of the fish or every egg in the incubator. Good sanitation and cleanliness are absolutely essential to effective control of fungi under intensive culture conditions. Mechanical andchemical methods have been used for the control of fungal infections oneggs. The mechanical method is used on both salmonid and catfish eggsand involves picking dead and infected eggs at frequent intervals dur-ing incubation. This, however, is time consuming, and some healthy eggsmay be injured in the process. Chemical control of fungal infections oneggs can be achieved, and formalin is now approved for use to controlSaprolegnia on eggs of all fish species. Gill rot, a disease caused by fungi of the genus Branchiomyces, is a major threat to fish culture in Europe. Primarily a disease of cyprinids inwarmer water, it has been found in trout, bass, northern pike, pumpkin-seed, and guppies in the United States. Clinical signs associated with604 WINTON branchio-mycosis include red-brown coloration of the gills with severe necrosis, fish gasping at the surface, and losses that can exceed 50% in afew days. A presumptive diagnosis of branchiomycosis can be made by micro- scopic examination of gill tissue. The red-brown, nonseptate hyphae andround spores of the fungus are seen in surface scrapings or in capillariesand tissue of the gill lamellae. There is no control for branchiomycosisexcept destruction of infected fish and disinfection of facilities. An important emerging fungal disease of fish is caused by species of the genus Aphanomyces that typically affect fish in marine or brackish waters. In Asia, a disease termed epizootic ulcerative syndrome or EUSis rapidly spreading and causing severe losses among species culturedin brackish water. Initially thought to be caused by viral or bacterialpathogens, the disease is characterized by deep ulcerative lesions thatshow an intense inflammatory response. In severe cases, internal organsare affected. Similar disease conditions in Australia, termed red-spotdisease, and in Japan, termed mycotic granulomatosis, have been de-scribed and attributed to A. invadens . More recently, an ulcerative myco- sis has been associated with losses of marine species in estuaries of theeastern United States, as well as the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. Diagnosis of Aphanomyces infections can be accomplished by light microscopy of scrapings from ulcerative lesions, as well as by cultureand the PCR using specific primer sets. Drugs and Chemicals Drugs, disinfectants, pesticides, diagnostic reagents, and vaccines areneeded to ensure the health and productivity of cultured fish stocks.These regulated products must be used in a manner to avoid risks topublic safety and animal health or potential loss of consumer trust. It isthe responsibility of everyone using, prescribing, or recommending theuse of regulated products to know which products legally can be usedunder federal, state, and local regulations. Much of the material in this section was taken (in some places ver- batim) from the Web site of the Aquaculture Network Information Cen-ter (AquaNIC). This important resource (see electronic references) spon-sored by the Joint Subcommittee on Aquaculture should be consultedfrequently for current information about the status of drugs and chemi-cals used in aquaculture because there is a high likelihood that the list ofapproved products will change frequently. This is due to the conflictingpressures to reduce the use of chemicals released into the environmentor of animal drugs that may give rise to antibiotic resistance in humanFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 605 pathogens and the substantial effort by many supporters of the aquacul- ture industry to increase the numbers of approved drugs and chemicalsfor fish. Legal Framework Various federal and state agencies are involved in regulating drugs, vac-cines, pesticides, and other products used in aquaculture. In the UnitedStates, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for en-suring the safety, wholesomeness, and proper labeling of food products;ensuring the safety and effectiveness of human and animal drugs; andprotecting consumers from economic fraud. The FDA's regulatory pro-grams are intended to ensure compliance with existing laws, and en-forcement activities include actions to correct and prevent violations,remove illegal products or goods from the market, and punish offend-ers. The testing of domestic and imported aquaculture products for drugand pesticide residues is part of these enforcement activities. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture, distribution, and use of animal drugs. CVM is responsiblefor ensuring that drugs used in food-producing animals are safe andeffective and that food products derived from treated animals are freefrom potentially harmful residues. CVM approves new animal drugsbased on data provided by a sponsor (usually a drug company). To beapproved, an animal drug must be effective for the claim on the labeland safe when used as directed for (1) treated animals, (2) persons ad-ministering treatment, (3) the environment, including nontarget organ-isms, and (4) consumers. CVM establishes tolerances and withdrawalperiods as needed for all drugs approved for use in food-producing ani-mals. CVM has the authority to grant investigational new animal drug(INAD) exemptions so that data can be generated to support the ap-proval of a new animal drug. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for reg- istering or licensing all pesticides used in the United States under theFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The FIFRArequires that the EPA register pesticides for specific uses, provided thatthe use does not pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the envi-ronment. Any pesticide sold or distributed in the United States must beregistered by the EPA. Products regarded as pesticides include algicides,disinfectants, fish toxicants, and herbicides. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulates all veterinary biologics distributedin the United States. This includes vaccines, biologics, and test kits for606 WINTON the diagnosis of disease. States may impose additional requirements on the use of veterinary biologics. For example, APHIS requires that stateapproval for distribution of products be obtained before APHIS autho-rizes field trials with experimental products or before a conditionallylicensed product is marketed in the state. The FDA and EPA have some areas of mutual regulatory responsi- bility. A memorandum of understanding provides guidance in the areaof aquaculture, particularly as to which agency has jurisdiction over aparticular substance for its intended use. The EPA has jurisdiction overdisinfectants, sanitizers, and aquatic treatments used solely for the con-trol of algae or bacterial slime and over any other aquatic treatmentsused solely for pest control that do not include claims for control of para-sites or diseases of fish. The EPA or a delegated state regulatory agencyalso regulates the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System(NPDES), which controls the discharge of drugs or pesticides into re-ceiving waters. The FDA has jurisdiction over new animal drugs, in-cluding products intended to treat or prevent parasites or diseases offish, anesthetize aquatic species, and alter the sex or regulate the repro-duction of aquatic species. The FDA has taken the position that if a pes-ticide registered by the EPA for aquaculture or aquatic site use is beingused properly (i.e., the labeled conditions in fact exist in the facility orsite at the time the pesticide is used, and the compound is not misusedunder FIFRA), the FDA will not object to that proper use even thoughthe pesticide may have a secondary therapeutic benefit. State departments of agriculture or other designated state agencies may also register federally approved pesticides to permit their legal dis-tribution and sale within a state or territory. States may have additionalregulatory requirements, including the provision of further data or ad-ditional restrictions on use and licensing. Some states license or imposeadditional regulations on the use of certain veterinary biologics. Somestates may not allow the use of specific products or may require theiradministration by licensed veterinarians. States also participate in theapproval of field trials of veterinary biologics in their respective juris-dictions and in the experimental use of certain veterinary biologics. Theuse of a drug under an INAD exemption may require approval by astate agency to comply with any local, state, and regional EPA dischargeregulations. Discharge approval is intended to ensure that the possibleimpacts of a discharge (effluent) containing a specific compound or itsresidues are addressed.FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 607 Legal Options for Obtaining Drugs According to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a drug is de- fined as an article that is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitiga-tion, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; anarticle (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any functionof the body of man or other animals; or an article that is recognized inofficial drug compendia. A new animal drug is a drug intended for ani-mals that is not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe andeffective for the uses recommended on the label. At present, no drugsused in aquaculture are considered by FDA to be generally recognizedas safe (GRAS) or effective (GRAE) for their proposed uses. For a com-pound to be classified as GRAS or GRAE, general recognition by expertsmust be supported by published scientific studies that meet strict FDAstandards. There are several options for legally obtaining and using drugs and chemicals. Use of drugs in a manner other than the options discussedbelow is subject to regulatory action by the FDA. 1. FDA-approved new animal drugs. Only a few new animal drugs are currently approved by the FDA for use in food-producing aquaticspecies. Each drug is approved for specific species, for specific dis-ease conditions, and at specific dosages. Refer to Table 1 for a listingof these approved drugs and their approved uses. This list willchange occasionally and current information should be obtained fromthe AquaNIC Web page or other sources. 2. Investigational new animal drugs. These drugs are used under an investigational new animal drug exemption. Investigational new ani-mal drug exemptions are administered by the FDA CVM to allowfor the purchase, shipment, and use of unapproved new animal drugsfor collection of effectiveness and safety data that will support adecision on drug approval. Numerous requirements must be metfor the establishment and maintenance of INADs. An INAD exemp-tion is provided with the expectation that useful data will be gener-ated and submitted to FDA CVM. The Food and Drug Administra-tion authorizes specific conditions of use and monitors all drugsunder each INAD exemption. Adequate drug accountability, datarecording, and reporting are foremost among the requirements forINAD exemptions. Additional information concerning INAD exemp-tions may be found on the CVM Web site. It must be stressed thatINAD exemptions are granted with the expectation that meaningfuldata will be generated to support a new animal drug approval andmust not be seen as a method of circumventing current law.

Unapproved new animal drugs of low regulatory priority. Neither an approved new animal drug application (NADA) nor an INADexemption is required for drugs in this category. Although the FDA is not aware of safety problems associated with the specific uses of these substances, their uses have not been shown to be safe and ef-fective in well-controlled scientific studies. Regulatory action is un-likely if an appropriate grade is used, good management practicesare followed, and local environmental requirements are met. Referto Table 2 for a listing of these compounds. It is unlikely that therewill be many additions to this category. 4. Extra-label use of an approved new animal drug. Under the provi- sions of the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act(AMDUCA), licensed veterinarians, within a valid veterinarian-cli-ent-patient relationship, can prescribe FDA approved new animaldrugs or new human drugs for an extra-label use. Extra-label use ofa drug refers to the actual or intended use of an approved new ani-mal drug in a manner not described on the label. This includes, butis not limited to, species, frequency, route of administration, dose,withdrawal time, and conditions of use. This extra-label use is lim-ited to treat modalities when the health of an animal is threatened orwhen suffering or death of the animal may result if not treated. Ex-tra-label use of FDA-approved new animal drugs or new humandrugs that are not prescribed by a licensed veterinarian is a viola-tion of law.610 WINTON TABLE 2. Unapproved new animal drugs of low regulatory priority for FDA. Common name Permitted use Acetic acid Used as a dip at a concentration of 1,000-2,000 mg/L for 1-10 min as a parasiticide for fish. Calcium chloride Used to increase water calcium concentration to ensure proper egg hardening. Dosages used would be those necessary toraise calcium concentration to 10-20 mg/L calcium carbonate. Also used to increase water hardness up to 150 mg/L to aid in maintenance of osmotic balance in fish by preventing electro-lyte loss. Calcium oxide Used as an external protozoacide for fingerling to adult fish at a concentration of 2,000 mg/L for 5 s. Carbon dioxide gas Used for anesthetic purposes in cold, cool, and warmwater fish. Fuller's earth Used to reduce the adhesiveness of fish eggs in order to im- prove hatchability.

Fish are immersed in a solution of 30,000 mg/L magnesium sulfate and 7,000 mg/L sodium chlo-ride for 5-10 min. Onion (whole) Used to treat external crustacean parasites and to deter sea lice from infesting external surface of fish at all life stages Papain Used as a 0.2% solution in removing the gelatinous matrix of fish egg masses in order to improve hatchability and decrease the incidence of disease. Potassium chloride Used as an aid in osmoregulation to relieve stress and prevent shock. Dosages used would be those necessary to increase chloride ion concentration to 10-2,000 mg/L. Povidone iodine Used as a fish egg disinfectant at rates of 50 mg/L for 30 min compounds during water hardening and 100 mg/L solution for 10 min after water hardening. Sodium bicarbon- Used at 142-642 mg/L for 5 minutes as a means of introducing ate (baking soda) carbon dioxide into the water to anesthetize fish. Sodium chloride Used as a 0.5-1% solution for an indefinite period as an (salt) osmoregulatory aid for the relief of stress and prevention of shock. Used as a 3% solution for 10-30 min as a parasiticide. Sodium sulfite Used as a 15% solution for 5-8 min to treat eggs in order to improve hatchability. Thiamine hydro- Used to prevent or treat thiamine deficiency in salmonids. Eggs chloride are immersed in an aqueous solution of up to 100 ppm for up to 4 h during water hardening. Sac fry are immersed in an aqueous solution of up to 1,000 ppm for up to 1 h. Urea and tannic Used to denature the adhesive component of fish eggs at acid concentrations of 15 g urea and 20 g NaCl/5 L of water forFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 611 Further Restrictions on Use New animal drugs that are added to aquaculture feed are subject to FDA regulation and must be specifically approved for use in aquaculture feed.Approved new animal drugs may be mixed in feed only for uses and atlevels that are specified in FDA medicated-feed regulations. It is unlaw-ful to add drugs to feed, even under extra-label use provisions, unlessthe drugs are approved for feed use. The FDA requires that certain millsproducing medicated feeds be licensed by the FDA. There are more de-tails on these regulations on the CVM Web site. Many of the chemicals used in aquaculture are applied directly to water where the FDA or EPA restrictions are determined by the intendeduse of the product. Although some products may be beneficial whenapplied to aquaculture systems at low concentrations, they may also actas irritants or even become toxic at higher concentrations. The improperuse or application of water treatments can cause severe stress, whichcan lead to an animal disease outbreak or even death. Some compoundscan accumulate in the animal and may cause illegal chemical residues intissues intended for human consumption. Illegal residues can also re-sult from the improper use of products to control weeds or unwantedfish or to alter water quality. To prevent possible fish losses and illegalchemical residues from excessive treatment levels, always read andstrictly follow product label directions. Product withdrawal times must be observed to ensure that prod-TABLE 2. (Continued.) approximately 6 min, followed by a separate solution of 0.75 g tannic acid/5 L water for anadditional 6 min. These amounts will treat approximately 400,000 eggs. Note. FDA is unlikely to object to the use of these low regulatory priority substances if the following conditions are met: 1. The drugs are used for the prescribed indications, including species and life stage where specified. 2. The drugs are used at the prescribed dosages. 3. The drugs are used according to good management practices. 4. The product is of an appropriate grade for use in food animals. 5. An adverse effect on the environment is unlikely. FDA's enforcement position on the use of these substances should be considered neither an approval nor an affirmation of their safety and effectiveness. Based on information available in the future, FDA may take a different position on their use. Classification of substances as new animal drugs of low regulatory priority does not exempt facilities fromcomplying with other federal, state, and local environmental requirements. For example, facilities using these substances would still be required to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System requirements.612 WINTON ucts reaching consumers are safe and wholesome. All federally approved products list any specific required withdrawal times to ensure that prod-ucts used in aquaculture do not exceed legal tolerance levels in animaltissues. Withdrawal information is found on the product label, packageinsert, or feed tag. An exception to withdrawal requirements is made forproducts used in an extra-label manner. Extra-label use may require thesame or a different withdrawal time from that listed on the label, de-pending on the species, treatment, and other conditions. Withdrawaltimes for the extra-label use of an approved product are not listed on thelabel and must be determined by the prescribing licensed veterinarian. Quality Assurance and Record Keeping Record keeping is a critical element of quality assurance programs.Record keeping may also be required of producers by processors pur-chasing fish from them to comply with hazard analysis critical controlpoint or HACCP requirements. A good record keeping system helps pro-ducers keep track of specific treatments and their results with identifi-able, known populations or stocks of aquatic animals, as well as the spe-cific water and land areas involved. Good records provide a basis forsound, cost-effective management decisions. The treatment status ofanimals, ponds, and other areas is known at all times. Records are neededto determine dosage rates and certify withdrawal times. Processors mayrequire records to demonstrate that all drugs and chemicals have beenused properly. Records provide valuable evidence and protection in li-ability cases. Accurate record keeping also is required for any producerusing an INAD exemption in clinical field trials. Quality assurance pro-grams have a high level of participation among many of the segments ofthe aquaculture industry. Using Drugs and Chemicals Product Label Always read and understand the product label before using any com- pound. Label directions and information are important for two reasons.First, they describe the conditions of use under which the product canbe expected to be effective and safe. Second, labels for approved prod-ucts describe uses allowed by law. The product label and package in-serts provided with regulated products present information on properstorage, mixing, dosage, and administration; date of expiration; dilut-ing or reconstituting the product; safe disposal of the unused productFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 613 and product containers; and withdrawal times. Pesticide labels list pre- cautionary statements on environmental, physical, and chemical haz-ards. Prescribed aquatic-use information is usually not found on the prod-uct labels of those substances determined by the FDA to be unapprovednew animal drugs of low regulatory priority (LRP) because these sub-stances typically are not marketed specifically for aquaculture use. Economic Considerations Drugs, pesticides, and vaccines are used to control or prevent specificdiseases, water quality conditions, and pest (e.g., weed) or stress prob-lems. These treatments should be used only when needed. Each treat-ment has an economic value in terms of treatment cost and expectedeconomic benefit. The proper use of regulated products, some of whichare quite costly, can be important in preventing significant economiclosses. Such losses are more likely to occur if the actual problem is incor-rectly diagnosed, if precautions for treatment are ignored, or if treat-ments are improperly applied. The use of best management practices inaquatic animal husbandry and water quality maintenance can reducethe use of regulated products. Using regulated products at less than theconcentrations or dosages specified on the label can cause the treatmentto be ineffective or only partially effective. Of particular concern is theemergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. Using these com-pounds at concentrations or in dosages greater than those specified onthe label (overdosing or over treating) wastes the product and can causeunwanted side effects, including stress and toxicity problems in aquaticstocks and nontarget organisms, as well as environmental damage. Per-sons applying regulated products should recognize their legal responsi-bility for any harm to nontarget aquatic and nonaquatic species and foroff-site damage. Storage and Handling Always follow label directions for storing, handling, mixing, diluting,reconstituting, and disposing of regulated products and their contain-ers. This preserves the activity and quality of the product and helps pre-vent misuse, damaging effects on plants and animals, human injury, andenvironmental contamination. Disinfectants, pesticides, and most drugsshould be stored in a locked cabinet in a dry, well-ventilated utility areaaway from children, animals, food, feed, and living areas. Some drugsand veterinary biologics require refrigerated storage; other products re-quire storage in a freezer or at room temperature. All disinfectants, pesti-614 WINTON cides, drugs, and veterinary biologics should be stored away from bright light, because light can cause inactivation or deterioration of the product. Regulated products should be stored in their original containers with the original label attached. Dampness in storage areas can cause paperpackages to deteriorate, metal containers to rust, and metal and glasscontainers to lose their labels. Disinfectants, pesticides, and drugs shouldnot be stored where flooding is possible or in sites where they mightspill or leak into the environment. High-temperatures can cause exces-sive pressure in and bursting of sealed containers. Exposure to high tem-peratures can also result in product deterioration, shortened shelf life,premature inactivity, and inactivation. Proper mixing, diluting, and reconstituting are essential for the ef- fectiveness of products requiring such steps, as well as for reasons ofsafety. Improper dilution may cause the concentration or dosage admin-istered to be too great or too small. Incomplete mixing can cause varia-tions in the concentration or dosage applied or administered, with un-even effects ranging from ineffectiveness to overdose and toxicity. Someveterinary biologics are supplied with diluents that should be used forreconstitution and the proper concentration of materials. Safety Considerations The use of any pesticide (and some other regulated products) requiresadequate protection from exposure. Users should always read the prod-uct label for information on recommended personal protective equip-ment. Common-sense precautions should be followed, such as wearinggloves, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks, shoes or boots, a hat, andgoggles, protective glasses, or a face shield. Powders may be harmful ortoxic if they are inhaled as dusts; fumes and evaporating ingredientsmay also be harmful or toxic. Some pesticides may require use of a res-pirator. Persons mixing or applying pesticide or working in an area wherepesticides are being applied or have recently been applied should showerand wash their clothes after actual or possible exposure. Users should not mix different regulated products unless this is spe- cifically recommended on the label. The combining of products can havemany\u2014mostly undesirable\u2014effects. One or both products can be inac-tivated, and chemical reactions can produce harmful gases or other re-action products and by-products, some of them toxic. Following appro-priate precautions can prevent accidental poisoning from pesticidecontact with bare skin or from the inhalation of fumes or dust. The pes-ticide label provides important product-specific information on mixing,diluting, storage, and disposal, as well as on first aid in the event ofaccidental poisoning. Material Safety Data Sheets, provided by productFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 615 manufacturers, are a source of additional information on safety precau- tions. It is important that unused portions of a regulated product andempty containers be disposed of properly. The best approach is to pur-chase only the amount of material that will be used within a reasonabletime period and to use all of the product for its intended purpose. Emptycontainers must be disposed of, however, and often a quantity of theproduct is left over. Product labels provide instructions for safe disposal;these instructions should be followed. Improper disposal can result intoxicity, environmental contamination, and liability problems. Applicators and persons near treatment areas can be affected by various regulated products through contact, exposure to evaporatedmaterial in the air, or exposure to dusts or aerosols. Treated waters orairborne drift can carry restricted products to distant locations, wherethe products may affect nontarget organisms and sites. Accidental self-injection of some veterinary biologics and injectable drugs can cause lo-cal tissue reactions, allergic reactions, or infections. Use of common senseand strict compliance with product label directions can minimize unde-sirable effects in humans, nontarget plants and animals, and the envi-ronment. Seek professional advice when in doubt. Disease Treatments In general, it is important to diagnose fish disease problems as early aspossible and to begin treatment as soon as practical. If routine diseaseproblems can be recognized early by the hatchery manager, treatmentcan begin sooner than if a diagnosis is required from a pathology labo-ratory. Broad-spectrum treatments based on a poor diagnosis are ill-ad-vised, but timely treatments based on keen observation and awarenessof signs can mean the difference between losing just a few fish or losingmany thousands. There are two classes of treatments for fish disease\u2014control and therapeutic. Control treatments are measures designed to prevent anoutbreak from occurring or increasing in magnitude. Such treatmentsare used primarily against external parasites, bacteria or fungi. Thera-peutic treatments are begun only after clinical signs appear in a signifi-cant number of animals. When frequent control treatments are neededfor external parasites or bacterial gill disease, it may be an indication ofpoor hatchery management. The general principle should be to managefirst and treat as a last resort. Fish disease treatments are a serious un-dertaking, and caution should be taken to avoid disastrous results. Alldrugs and chemicals used to control infectious organisms can be toxic tofish if concentrations are too high. All treatment calculations should bedouble-checked before being implemented.616 WINTON Two important principles should be kept in mind regarding the treat- ment of fish diseases. Firstly, treatment with various medications andchemotherapeutic agents is for the purpose of tipping the balance infavor of the host, not for killing 100% of the disease organisms present.Medications may kill or retard the growth of the pathogen, but in theend, it is the fish's own immune mechanisms that must overcome thedisease if the treatment is to be successful. Secondly, there is increasingconcern regarding the use of drugs and chemicals in aquaculture. Theseconcerns center around possible environmental harm and the develop-ment of antibiotic resistance in aquatic microorganisms that might betransferred to human pathogens. To help allay these concerns, the use ofdrugs and chemicals should be reduced as much as possible and antibi-otic treatments rotated among various compounds and continued forthe full treatment period to reduce the development of drug-resistantbacteria. Treatment Methods Before making a decision to treat a group of fish, the following ques-tions should be asked: 1. Does the loss rate, severity, or nature of the disease warrant treat- ment? 2. Is the disease treatable, and what is the prognosis for successful treat- ment? 3. Is it feasible to treat the fish where they are, considering the cost, handling, prognosis? 4. Is it worthwhile to treat the fish or will the cost of treatment exceed their value? 5. Are the fish in good enough condition to withstand the treatment?6. Will the treated fish be released or moved soon and is adequate with- drawal or recovery time available? Before any treatment is started, four factors must be considered. The culturist must know and understand (1) the water supply, (2) the fish,(3) the chemical, and (4) the disease. Failure to take all these factors intoconsideration can result in a complete kill of all of the treated fish or afailure to control the disease with a resultant loss of many fish and wastedmoney. 1.Water supply. The volume of water in the rearing unit to be treated and the flow rate to the unit must be calculated accurately beforeany treatment is applied. An overestimation of the water volume orflow rate means too much drug or chemical will be used, which mayFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 617 kill all the fish. An underestimation of the volume or flow means not enough of the drug or chemical will be used, thus, the disease-causing organism may not be controlled. Often overlooked is thefact that water quality factors, such as total hardness, pH, and tem-perature, will increase the activity of some chemicals and decreasethat of others. In ponds, the amount and type of aquatic vegetationor organic matter also must be taken into consideration before anychemical is applied. 2.Fish. Fish of different species and ages may react very differently to the same drug or chemical. Certain species are much more sensitiveto a particular chemical than others. The age of fish may also affecthow they react to a specific treatment. Regardless of whether or nota particular chemical or drug has been used to treat fish at the hatch-ery in the past, it is always a good idea to test it first on a smallnumber of fish before an entire pond or holding unit is treated. Thiscan be done in tanks or in small containers such as large plastic waste-baskets. 3.Chemical . The toxicity of the chemical should be known for the spe- cies to be treated. The effect of water chemistry on the toxicity of thechemical also should be known. Some chemicals break down rap-idly in the presence of sunlight and high temperatures and, thus, areless likely to be effective during summer months than during thecooler months of the year. Mixing chemicals may enhance or inten-sify the toxicity of one of them. Also, certain chemicals are toxic toplants and can cause oxygen depletion if used in ponds at the wrongtime. 4.Disease . Although the correct diagnosis of a disease may be self-evi- dent, confirmatory testing or a second opinion from a fish healthprofessional is important. Most chemicals used to treat fish diseasesare expensive and, generally, are effective only against certain groupsof organisms. Use of the wrong chemical or drug usually means thatseveral days to a week may pass before one realizes the treatmentwas not effective. During this time, large numbers of fish may belost unnecessarily. In addition, bacterial pathogens may be resistantto one or more antibiotics and this should be determined before treat-ment is begun. When it is apparent that a treatment is necessary, the following check- lists may be useful: Pretreatment checklist1. Accurately determine the water volume, flow rate, and temperature. 2. Accurately determine the number and total weight of fish in the rear-618 WINTON ing unit. 3. Confirm the identity, purity, age, and stock strength of the drug or chemical to be applied. 4. Double-check concentration figures to be delivered. Beware of co- fusion from mixing metric and English units. 5. Have aeration devices ready for use if needed.6. Make sure of the route by which chemical solutions are discharged from the holding unit. 7. Test treatment on a pilot group of fish. Treatment checklist1. Dilute the chemical with rearing water to the correct concentration before applying it. 2. Ensure the chemical is well-mixed in the units or ponds.3. Observe fish closely and frequently during treatment for signs of distress. 4. Monitor temperature and dissolved oxygen levels in the rearing unit during treatment (aeration may be required). 5. Discontinue treatment and resume water flow immediately if fish become distressed. Posttreatment checklist1. Observe fish frequently for at least 24 h following treatment. 2. Do not stress treated fish for at least 48 h.3. Recheck fish to determine success of treatment. Various methods of treatment and drug application have been used in the control of fish diseases. There is no one specific method that isbetter than others; rather, the method of treatment should be based onthe specific situation encountered. Here, experience is exceptionally valu-able. A fish health professional or other knowledgeable source shouldbe consulted if one is unfamiliar with the disease or treatment proposed. Dip Treatments During the dip treatments, small numbers of fish are placed in a net anddipped in a strong solution of chemical for a short time, usually 15-45 s,depending on the type of chemical, its concentration, and the species offish being treated. Metal containers should not be used to hold the treat-ment solution because some chemicals can react with the metal and formtoxic compounds, particularly if the water is acidic. This method of treat-ment is dangerous because the difference between an effective dose andFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 619 a killing dose often is very small. Other disadvantages to this method include its high labor costs and stress on the fish due to handling. How-ever, if done properly, it is very effective for treating relatively smallnumbers of valuable fish. Flush Treatments Flush treatments are simple and consist of adding a solution of the treat-ment chemical at the upper end of a holding unit and allowing it to flushthrough. It has been used at trout and salmon hatcheries, but is appli-cable only with raceways, tanks, troughs, or incubators for which anadequate flow of water is available, so that the chemical is completelyflushed through the unit or system within a predetermined time. Highlytoxic chemicals should be avoided because there is no way to assure auniform concentration within the unit being treated. Prolonged Bath For prolonged-bath treatments, the inflowing water is cut off and thecorrect amount of chemical is added directly to the unit being treated.After a specified time, the chemical is flushed out quickly with freshwater. This treatment can be used in any unit that has an adequate sup-ply of fresh water that can flush out the treatment within 5-10 min. Sev-eral precautions must be observed with this method to prevent seriouslosses: (1) Because the water flow is turned off, the oxygen concentra-tion of the water may be reduced to the point that the fish are stressedand losses occur to anoxia. The more fish per unit volume of water, themore likely this is to occur. Aerators of some type must be available orinstalled in the unit being treated to ensure an adequate oxygen supplyduring the treatment period; (2) In areas with warm weather or intensesunlight, the temperature of the rearing unit may rise significantly put-ting the fish at risk; (3) Regardless of the treatment time that is recom-mended, the fish always should be observed throughout the treatmentand, at the first sign of distress, fresh water must be added quickly;(4) The chemical must be uniformly distributed throughout the unit toprevent the occurrence of \"hot spots\" of the chemical. Fish being treatedmay be killed or severely injured by overdoses if they swim through hotspots. Conversely, fish that avoid these hot spots may not be exposed toa concentration high enough to be effective. The method used for dis-tributing the chemical throughout the unit will depend on the kind ofchemical being used, type and size of unit being treated, and equipmentand labor available.620 WINTON Indefinite Bath Indefinite bath treatments usually are used to treat ponds or other large volumes having low (or no) flow rates. A low concentration of a chemi-cal is applied and left to dissipate naturally. This generally is one of thesafest methods of treatment. One major drawback, however, is that largequantities of chemicals may be required that can be expensive to thepoint of being prohibitive. Another drawback relates to the possible ad-verse effects on the pond environment. Some treatment chemicals arealgicidal or herbicidal and may kill enough plants to ultimately cause anoxygen deficit. Other chemicals, such as formalin, may reduce dissolvedoxygen levels as they degrade. As in prolonged-bath treatments, it is important that the chemical be evenly distributed throughout the culture unit to prevent the occur-rence of hot spots. For dry chemicals that dissolve rapidly in water, suchas copper sulfate or potassium permanganate, burlap or any coarse-weave bags can be used. The required amount of chemical is put into abag and towed behind a boat so that the chemical dissolves in the wakeof the boat. Liquids and wettable powders can be applied evenly withhand or power sprayers or can be siphoned over the edge of a boat intothe prop wash. As with the prolonged-bath method, there is no one cor-rect way to apply a chemical evenly to the unit of water to be treated.Rather, the application will depend on the kind of chemical being used,the equipment available, and the type of unit to be treated. Again, expe-rience is the best guide. Constant-Flow Treatments Constant-flow treatments are useful in raceways, tanks, or troughs insituations where it is impractical or impossible to shut off the inflowingwater long enough to use prolonged baths. The volume of water flow-ing into the unit must be determined accurately, and a stock solution ofthe chemical metered into the inflowing water to obtain the desired con-centration. Before the metering device or constant flow siphon that de-livers the chemical is started, enough chemical should have been addedto the water in the device to give the desired concentration. Upon comple-tion of the desired treatment period, the inflow of chemical is stoppedand the unit is flushed by allowing the water flow to continue. Themethod by which the chemical is metered into the inflowing water willdepend on the equipment available and the type of unit to be treated.Although the constant-flow method is very efficient, it can be expensiveif large volumes of water must be treated.FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 621 Feeding Treatment of certain diseases, such as systemic bacterial infections and certain internal parasite infestations, requires that the drug be introducedinto the fish's body. This usually is accomplished by incorporating themedication in the feed. Treatment by feeding is usually based on bodyweight; standard treatments are typically given in grams or microgramsof active drug per kilogram of fish per day. Medicated food should bepurchased commercially from an approved source. Beginning treatmentearly is important because once an outbreak is underway, many of thefish may be clinically ill and cease feeding, making it impossible to stopthe losses in a timely manner. Once feeding of medicated food is begun,it should be continued for the prescribed treatment period. Injection Large and valuable fish, particularly small numbers of them, sometimescan be treated best with injections of medication into the body cavity(intraperitoneal) or into the muscle tissue (intramuscular). Most drugswork rapidly when injected intraperitoneally. For both types of injec-tions, but particularly intraperitoneal ones, caution must be exercised toensure that internal organs are not damaged. The most convenient loca-tion for intraperitoneal injections is the base of one of the pelvic fins. Thepelvic fin is partially lifted, and the needle placed at the fin base andinserted until its tip penetrates the body wall. The needle and syringeshould be held on a line parallel to the long axis of the body and at abouta 45 degree angle to avoid internal organs. One can tell when the bodywall has been penetrated by the sudden decrease of pressure against theneedle. As soon as the tip of the needle is in the body cavity, the requiredamount of medication should be injected rapidly and the needle with-drawn. For intramuscular injections, the best location usually is the areaimmediately ahead of the dorsal fin. The syringe and needle should beheld on a line parallel with the long axis of the body and at about a 45degree angle. The needle is inserted to a depth of about 0.5-1.0 cm andthe medication is injected directly into the muscle of the back. The injec-tion must be done slowly, otherwise back pressure will force the medi-cation out of the muscle through the channel created by the needle. Foradult salmon broodstock, some drugs (e.g., erythromycin) are injecteddirectly into the dorsal sinus.622 WINTON Immunization of Fish Prevention of disease through vaccination is an important adjunct to the maintenance of fish health. In addition to the commercial availability ofseveral new vaccines, it has become increasingly clear that reliance onthe use of antimicrobial drugs and chemicals in fish culture will have tobe reduced. Firstly, the list of antibacterial drugs and chemicals that canlegally be used is extremely small (especially in the United States andCanada) and the effectiveness of the few available antibacterial drugs isbeing diminished because of the development of antibiotic resistanceamong bacterial fish pathogens. Secondly, the prospects for enlargingthe list are limited due to the extensive testing needed to meet stringentlicensing requirements and concerns that antibiotic resistance might betransmissible to microorganisms of public health importance. Finally,none of the viral and many of the bacterial, fungal, or protozoan infec-tions in fish can be successfully treated using the antibiotics or chemi-cals currently available or anticipated in the near future. Faced with the foregoing problems, fish culturists should consider other measures that might help to ensure the health of the aquatic animalsunder their care. One obvious approach is immunization. Advantages ofimmunization are several. Firstly, immunization does not generate antibi-otic resistant microorganisms; secondly, it can be applied to control viral,as well as bacterial diseases; thirdly, fish may be vaccinated economicallyand conveniently while still very small; and fourthly, protection conferredby vaccination is more durable than that resulting from chemotherapyand persists for a considerable period. Finally, with killed vaccines, at least,the requirements for licensing the vaccines may be less stringent than thoserequired for the registration of antimicrobial drugs. Initially, the biggest factor working against the widespread use of fish vaccination was the lack of a safe, economical, and convenient techniquefor vaccinating large numbers of fish. Recent advances have remediedthis obstacle and mass-delivery methods are now routinely used. In addi-tion, improvements in adjuvant formulations and the development ofmultivalent vaccines have led to the widespread use of vaccines for pre-vention of several of the most important bacterial diseases of fish. Recentadvances in the molecular biology of fish pathogens and the developmentof novel approaches in vaccinology have opened the way for a new gen-eration of fish vaccines that promise further improvements in the abilityto protect populations of cultured fish against significant diseases.FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 623 Killed Vaccines The ideal fish vaccine is global in scope (i .e., composed of antigens com- mon to all strains) and capable of stimulating specific, long-lasting, hu-moral and cellular immune responses that result in solid protection. Tra-ditional fish vaccines have used killed preparations of bacteria, viruses,fungi, or parasites delivered by waterborne exposure or by injection withadjuvants and today, this strategy forms the basis for most of the fishvaccines that have become commercially successful. A new generationof killed vaccines is expected as better delivery systems and new adju-vants become available. A significant advantage of killed vaccines is their high degree of safety and ease of development. This has also made them relatively easy tolicense. In fact, the main requirements for autogenous vaccines (killedcultures of a pathogen isolated from animals at an individual farm andrestricted to use on that farm) is that they be produced in a licensedfacility and used under the supervision of a veterinarian. The disadvan-tages of killed vaccines are that they are sometimes only effective whendelivered by injection in the presence of an adjuvant and that protectionis often less solid or of shorter duration than that resulting from naturalinfections. In addition, killed viral vaccines that must be produced incell culture are probably not cost-effective for small fish. Attenuated Vaccines Attenuated vaccines for fish have been developed by traditional meth-ods of serial passage in culture, by using naturally occurring mutantsand cross-reacting strains or by mutagenesis of wild-type organisms.While effective in laboratory trials, acceptance has been slow due to con-cerns about the release of live organisms into the environment and theperceived potential of the vaccine strain to revert to virulence, to repli-cate in the fish in unwanted ways, or to infect nontarget species. Thismeans that the testing required for attenuated vaccines can be extensive,making development costs relatively high. In addition, without a ge-netic marker to distinguish the vaccine strain from natural isolates, di-agnostic examinations may be compromised and the vaccine will be dif-ficult to protect commercially. More recently, molecular approaches havebeen used to circumvent some of these concerns. Following initial de-velopment, attenuated vaccines for fish can be produced inexpensivelyand delivered efficiently by waterborne exposure. Because the attenu-ated strain replicates in the fish, it will stimulate both humoral and cel-lular immunity that is often superior to that provided by killed vaccines.624 WINTON The Next Generation of Fish Vaccines In the last decade, the techniques of molecular biology have been used to develop a novel set of vaccines for fish. While several of these newapproaches have been effective in stimulating specific immunity againstchallenge in the laboratory, only a few have been tested in field trials,and more work is needed to develop better delivery systems or to over-come potential regulatory concerns. For fish, the most promising of thesenew approaches include subunit vaccines, recombinant vectors, and ge-netic immunization. Subunit vaccines consist of only a portion of a pathogen that will stimulate protective immunity. This is typically a protein that bears aprotective antigen or the immunogenic region of such a protein. Whilesubunit vaccines can be created by purification of the native antigen di-rectly from cultures of the pathogen, development of a subunit vaccineby recombinant DNA technology usually involves inserting all or partof the gene coding for the appropriate antigen into a bacterium, yeast, orvirus that can produce large amounts of the protein in vitro. Because noinfectious agent is present, subunit vaccines are regarded as having ahigh level of safety, and the cost of producing the vaccine can be quitelow after initial research and development costs. Although relatively easyto produce and license, the subunit vaccines that have been tested in fishhave generally been less effective than desired. Subunit vaccines can alsobe made by chemical synthesis of peptides that mimic the antigenicepitope. However, like other subunit vaccines, they are more effectivewhen delivered by injection with an adjuvant and may require couplingto a carrier molecule. Another drawback is that creation of peptide vac-cines requires a detailed knowledge of the epitope structure of the pro-tective antigens of the pathogen. Recombinant vectors make use of DNA technology to insert copies of the genes from protective antigens into a virus or bacterium that willbe able to infect the host and replicate without causing disease. Whilereplicating, high levels of the recombinant antigen are produced by thevector that will stimulate the host immune system. One concern is thatthe method may be somewhat difficult to license owing to the use of areplicating recombinant organism. However, the strategy promises tobe highly effective, and several human and animal vaccines are beingdeveloped with this approach. A significant advantage of recombinantvectors is that they readily lend themselves to the creation of multiva-lent vaccines that could stimulate protection against several pathogenssimultaneously. Also, because of the replication of the vector, other as-pects of host immunity may be co-stimulated. Genetic immunization by injection of plasmid DNA coding for pro-FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 625 tective antigens represents an exciting new area of vaccine development. Demonstrated in laboratory trials to be effective for viral, bacterial, andparasitic diseases of higher animals, the major advantage of this approachis that cells transfected with the plasmid produce the antigen in its au-thentic form. To the immune system of the animal, these cells appear tobe infected and a full immune response is produced resulting in strong,long-lasting protection. Currently, these preparations have to be deliv-ered by injection or by \"gene gun\" making them either more labor inten-sive or somewhat less efficient than desired; better delivery methods areneeded if this technology is to become widely used in fish. Finally, be-cause this technology is new, the potential for licensing these vaccines isdifficult to evaluate; however, most concerns are expected to ease as DNAvaccines are developed for human and animal diseases. While substantial progress has been made in the molecular biology of fish pathogens and in the construction of novel vaccines that are ef-fective in the laboratory, much remains to be done. The high cost of de-velopment and licensing of these vaccines is a major problem, especiallyif the market for the vaccine is limited to a small geographic area or to aminor species in aquaculture. Other significant problems that need to beovercome are the lack of optimal adjuvants and mass delivery systemsfor killed and subunit vaccines and an incomplete understanding of criti-cal elements of the fish immune system. Although it is difficult to predict the future of fish vaccination, re- cent experience suggests that there will be a trend toward the use ofattenuated vaccines, recombinant vectors, and genetic immunization. Thegenetic engineering of stable attenuations with essentially no likelihoodof reversion, no antibiotic resistance genes, and simple genetic markerswill provide attenuated vaccines with significantly improved safety andacceptance. The low cost and high efficiency of such attenuated vaccinesmake them attractive candidates for commercial development. Geneticimmunization, likewise, appears highly promising, especially for com-plex, conformation-dependent epitopes that serve as single protectiveimmunogens; however, improved delivery systems will be required be-fore this method can gain widespread use. Work will also continue onthe development of recombinant vectors that can provide mass immu-nization. Finally, there will be a trend toward use of multivalent vac-cines in an effort to lower costs. Vaccination Methods Vaccines may be delivered to fish by intraperitoneal or intramuscularinjection using a needle and syringe, by oral delivery where the vaccine626 WINTON is incorporated into the feed, or by direct immersion of fish into the vac- cination solution. These methods work well for various commerciallyavailable preparations, but further improvements are needed. Not allvaccines are equally efficacious when delivered by these methods andwhere many small fish must be vaccinated economics dictate that a low-cost method (oral or immersion) must be used. Recent advances in vac-cine delivery promise to improve the efficacy of the methods availableand to provide additional methods in the future. Mass inoculation by intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection works well with fish that are 5-10 g or larger, and teams of operators are able tovaccinate several thousand fish per hour. The cost of this delivery methodis reasonable for large or highly valuable animals, but the number offish that can be treated is limited by the manpower available and bytechnical limitations such as the area available for setting up the anes-thetic baths and inoculating tables. In some areas of the world, however,vaccination by injection is practiced on a large commercial scale withsubstantial efficacy. Oral immunization has been shown to be effective in the laboratory, but is not yet used commercially. The method is low cost and will be thepreferred method for the future. One difficulty has been that the leveland duration of protection offered by oral immunization has typicallybeen less than that offered by injection or immersion methods. Microen-capsulation of the vaccine to avoid inactivation by the low pH in thestomach and other methods to improve uptake of the antigens in thelower intestine offer new approaches that will improve efficacy of prepa-rations delivered by this method. The immersion method allows vaccination of several thousand fish quickly and safely in a short period. Weighed volumes of fish are lightlyanesthetized and placed briefly into a solution of commercially preparedvaccine diluted in the rearing water. The vaccine is taken up by exposedtissues in the skin, gill, mouth, or anus and transported to cells that pro-cess the antigen and stimulate the immune response. Most of the com-mercially successful vaccines are killed bacterial preparations (bacterins)that can be effectively delivered in this manner. Today, monovalent and multivalent bacterins against several fish pathogens are licensed for commercial use in the United States (Table 3).While these are highly effective, additional vaccines are needed to pre-vent other important diseases in aquaculture. Following the relativelyrapid development and successful application of the bacterins listed,creation of additional vaccines has proven more difficult than hoped.This has probably been due to the failure of these newer preparations tostimulate the appropriate protective responses in the fish and the needto vaccinate large numbers of small animals economically.

Fish Disease Policies and Regulations The last 25 years have seen significant changes in disease control withthe emphasis shifting from treatment to prevention. International, na-tional, and regional regulations have been passed to minimize the spreadof certain contagious diseases of fish, and both agricultural authoritiesand fisheries agencies have increased their emphasis on protecting thehealth of aquatic animals raised by both the public and private sectors. The Office International des Epizooties (OIE) in Paris, France, is (Canada)FISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 629 world animal health organization charged with developing guidelines and procedures for reducing the spread of infectious animal diseases onbehalf of more than 150 member countries. In 1960, the OIE created theFish Diseases Commission in recognition of the increasing importanceof aquaculture and the potential for the international spread of impor-tant diseases of aquatic animals. The OIE publishes an internationalaquatic animal code and diagnostic manual for listed diseases of aquaticanimals. Member countries are encouraged to use these guidelines toestablish disease-free zones and farms in order to reduce the risk ofspreading diseases associated with international shipment of aquaticanimals. Many of the OIE materials are available via the Internet (seeelectronic resources at the end of this chapter). Following creation of the European Community (EC), a series of di- rectives was issued, beginning in 1991, to prevent the introduction andspread of aquatic animal diseases among member states. These directives(91/67, 91/492, 91/493, 92/53, 93/54) specify testing methods and con-trol measures to be applied to fish and shellfish products to be importedinto the EC. It is expected that these directives will be updated regularlyto ensure that they are consistent with the guidelines of the OIE. In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 50, Chap- ter 1, Part 16, Injurious Wildlife, was amended in 1993. The revised textstates that salmonids and their eggs can only be imported into the UnitedStates if accompanied by a certificate stating the shipment is free of theviral pathogens OMV beeneviscerated, processed by certain methods, or captured commercially inthe open sea are exempt. The director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser-vice maintains a list of persons who are authorized to conduct the speci-fied inspections and issue the required certificates. In addition, all livesalmonid eggs imported into the United States must be disinfected within24 h before shipment by immersion for 15 min in an iodophor solutioncontaining at least 75 ppm active iodine. These regulations will also re-quire regular updating. In 1997, Canada amended the federal Fish Health Protection Regu- lations that address international and interprovincial movement of salmo-nids and their eggs. The Canadian regulations deal with all species andhybrids of fish in the family Salmonidae. Live fish to be imported intoCanada or shipped between provinces must be tested and found free ofany filterable replicating agent able to cause cytopathic effects in speci-fied cell cultures including, but not limited to, VHSV , IHNV , and IPNV.Also Ceratomyxa shasta . Live eggs must be tested for viral agents and surface disinfected630 WINTON before shipment. Dead, uneviscerated fish must be tested and found free of VHSV and M. cerebralis . More recently, several other countries have begun to draft regulations affecting the importation or internal move-ment of aquatic animals. An important goal for the future is to ensurethese regulations are harmonized. Within the United States, disease-control programs are also admin- istered by the Colorado River Wildlife Council, the Great Lakes FisheryCommission, the Pacific Northwest Fish Health Protection Commission,the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, several tribes, and numerous states.Most of the state, regional, and national programs include regulations torestrict the movement of fish unless inspected and found free of certainpathogens. While these programs represent important cooperative ef-forts among the various management agencies, there is a lack of agree-ment among the various entities as to the pathogens and host species forwhich inspections must be conducted. It will be important to make thelist of pathogens, host species, and inspection methods consistent amongthe various states and regions of the United States in order to develop amore uniform national program in fish health. Fish Disease Control Programs A fish disease control program should emphasize all aspects of goodhealth, including infectious diseases, nutrition, physiology, and envi-ronment. The first step of any program must be the establishment oflong-range goals. These goals may be broad in concept or may dictateeradication of specific pathogens. The latter is more difficult to achieveand it is possible to have disease control without pathogen eradication. After the goals of disease control have been established, it is neces- sary to design a policy that is compatible with other fishery resourcepriorities. The backbone of the policy should be a monitoring programthat will determine the range of serious fish pathogens and detect newoutbreaks of disease. Control and containment of fish diseases requirethe periodic examination of hatchery populations, as well as fish thatare free-ranging in natural waters. The health of hatchery fish extendsbeyond their cultural confinement to natural populations, which theyaffect either through direct contact or via the effluent from hatchery op-erations. A monitoring program should include 1. Fish health laboratories equipped to test for disease agents, nutri- tional deficiencies, and tissue residues; 2. A corps of competent, qualified individuals trained in inspection and laboratory procedures; 3. A training program in fish health for all persons involved in fishFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 631 husbandry; 4. Agreements between various government agencies and private groups to establish lines of communication, as well as the storageand cataloging of data derived from the monitoring program; 5. Specific guidelines for laboratory procedures to be followed and for qualifications of persons and laboratories doing the inspections andtesting; 6. The development of specific steps for disease reporting and a list of reportable pathogens; and 7. Preplanned courses of action that will be used to control or eradi- cate a reportable disease when it occurs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has established a national program for fish disease control administered through a series of regional fish healthcenters. The plan provides for determining the distribution of specificpathogens within the National Hatchery System, restricting dissemina-tion of fish pathogens, and eradicating certain disease agents from federalfish hatcheries. The policy also provides for research and training in epi-demiology, prevention, control, and diagnosis of various fish diseases.Recently, the agency has initiated a comprehensive national wild fish healthsurvey. Many states, tribes, and regions have developed similar diseasecontrol programs for hatchery facilities under their authority. The Fish Health Professional Initially, those knowledgeable about matters of fish health were typi-cally hatchery managers or workers who developed an interest in dis-ease diagnosis and treatment in order to be more successful at rearingaquatic species in captivity. In addition, a small cadre of academics wasinterested in fish parasites and pathogens as objects of study. Eventu-ally, through personal contact and training, usually provided by aca-demic institutions or federal laboratories (e.g., the \"short\" and \"long\"courses in fish health taught at the Leetown laboratory), a corps of fishhealth experts developed who could assist hatchery managers in diag-nosis of infectious disease and recommend appropriate treatment. Today, the fish health professional may be a veterinarian with spe- cialized training in aquatic animal medicine; an academic with researchexpertise in infectious diseases of fish; a state, federal, or tribal fish bi-ologist with specific training in fish health from various sources; andothers who have an interest in this expanding field. The Fish HealthSection (FHS) of the American Fisheries Society maintains a certificationprogram for fish pathologists and fish health inspectors who have therequired training and experience to provide expert advice and to con-632 WINTON duct fish health inspections. These professionals often work for federal, tribal, or state agencies in facilities that are specialized for work withfish diseases. Several universities and private individuals have also es-tablished laboratories that can help in disease diagnosis and provideinspection services to the private aquaculture industry. Fish Health Inspections During an on-site fish health inspection at a hatchery, the fish healthprofessional will collect random samples of fish tissues for analysis. Thetests to be conducted will vary according to the type of testing requestedand should follow the standardized procedures of the most recent edi-tions of the Fish Health Section of the American Fisheries Society\"Bluebook\" officially titled Procedures for the Detection and Identification of Certain Fish and Shellfish Pathogens, the Fish Health Protection Regula- tions, Manual of Compliance published by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada, or the Diagnostic Manual for Aquatic Animal Dis- eases published by the Office International des Epizooties in Paris, France. The inspector typically takes tissues from a specified number of fish from each population at the hatchery. In most cases, each fish sampledmust be killed. The minimum sample size from each population willfollow a statistical plan that provides a 95% confidence for including aninfected fish in the sample where the incidence of infection is equal to,or greater than, a specified level, usually 2 or 5%. The inspector willappreciate some advance preparation on the part of the hatchery man-ager and assistance in providing equipment needed to sample the rear-ing units and a place to work. The sample population is determined on the basis of hatchery vari- ables such as species, age, and water source. Generally, fish are sampledby \"lot.\" A lot being defined as fish of the same species, originating fromthe same spawning population that have always shared the same watersupply. Thus, when fish are held in different water supplies, each grouphas to be sampled as a separate population. All broodstock of the samespecies held in a single water supply can be considered one population.Broodstock are usually inspected during the period when eggs are be-ing obtained. All fish on hand at the time of inspection constitute the population and are sampled accordingly. Samples are collected from each tank orrearing unit. Suspect fish (moribund specimens) are collected along withhealthy individuals. Fish should be alive when collected. Necropsy pro-cedures assume that the same fish may provide tissues for the variouslaboratory tests (bacterial, viral, and parasitic). A modified procedureFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 633 may be required for very small fish. Material to be examined for exter- nal parasites must be taken before any antiseptic or disinfectant proce-dures are applied. After the body has been opened aseptically, tissuesfor bacterial cultures and virus tests are collected. These tissues shouldbe refrigerated or stored on ice and must not be frozen. Finally, any his-tological samples are taken and placed in fixative. At least 2 weeks are required for the laboratory analyses to be com- pleted. Upon completion of the tests, a certifying official will issue areport specifying the samples taken, the laboratory tests conducted, andthe findings. The exact type of report can vary according to the govern-mental agency involved and the circumstances of the inspection. Diagnostic Examinations Correct diagnosis depends upon accurate and detailed information re-garding the fish, the signs observed, the history of the facility, and theconditions under which the fish were raised. The more information thatis available, the more likely that the diagnosis will be correct. If spacepermits, a small area of the hatchery should be devoted to fish healthexaminations. This space can be used by hatchery personnel to monitorlevels of external bacteria or parasites and to perform standard micro-biological procedures. The space will also be needed by a fish healthprofessional conducting inspections or diagnostic examinations. In ad-dition to being dry and well-lit, the space should have a bench or tablefor preparation of specimens, a compound light microscope and variousslides, stains, incubator, culture media, and small equipment that maybe needed to perform on-site diagnostic tests. Even after a preliminary diagnosis by the hatchery staff, a fish health professional should be contacted who may visit the hatchery or requestthat specimens be sent to the laboratory for verification. Although thesymptoms may seem typical, another disease may be present and whiletreatments may be effective for one condition, the other disease may stillbe uncontrolled. Hatchery personnel should furnish the fish health pro-fessional with correctly collected and handled material, including allavailable information, at the earliest possible date. To assist in obtaininga correct diagnosis, specimens should be collected before any treatmentis given or started. Only a few fish need be collected for on-site examina-tion or sent for examination, but these should be collected with the ut-most care. Dead fish or fish that appear to be normal are nearly worth-less. The most desirable fish are those that show most typically the signsof the disease in question. Moribund, but still living, fish are the best fordiagnostic purposes.634 WINTON Shipping Live Specimens When it is necessary to ship live specimens for diagnostic purposes, (1) assure that everything possible is done to ensure that the specimenswill be received alive, and (2) take extra precautions to ensure that otherparcels will not be damaged by water leakage. Shipments should bearthe notation \"Live Fish\u2014This Side Up\" and should be sent by the mostrapid means possible. If air express shipments are needed, packing should allow for gas expansion that occurs at altitude. Plastic bags containing about one-fourthwater and half or less air or oxygen usually provide room for expansion.A general precaution is to use a double bag system, one bag filled andsealed within another. It is best to ship a minimum number of specimens.Sick fish and coldwater species, such as trout, require greater volumes ofwater than healthy or warmwater fish. Twenty volumes of water for eachvolume of fish usually will be adequate for healthy fish, but greater vol-umes should be provided for sick fish. During extreme hot or cold weather,insulated containers may be required. Coldwater species usually ship betterif ice is provided. The ice should be packed in double plastic bags so thatit will not leak when it melts, especially if the ice is made with chlorinatedcity water and placed in the water containing the fish. Shipping Preserved Specimens Preservatives typically are corrosive and odorous. Containers should beunbreakable and absorbent material should be provided in the eventleakage occurs. A good procedure is to fix the fish in a proper fixative fora day or two, then place the preserved fish, with a very small volume offixative, in a plastic bag. The sealed bag should be placed within a sec-ond plastic bag, which also should be sealed. This durable package hasminimal weight. Select representative specimens. Examine them care-fully and record relevant data. Buffered formalin or Davidson's fixa-tives are preferred to Bouin's solution that contains picric acid that maybecome explosive when improperly stored. The volume of the fixative should be at least five to ten times that of the fish or tissue. Fish and tissues should be left in the fixative for at least24 h and then the fixing solution replaced with 70% ethyl alcohol. How-ever, if alcohol is not available, retain the specimens in fixative. To facili-tate fixation, fish should be slit down the abdomen from the anus to thegills. The air bladder should be broken to permit fixation of the kidney.The kidney of fish 15 cm or larger should be split along its entire length.The intestines and other organs should be slit if the fish are larger thanFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 635 fingerlings. It also is desirable to cut the skin along the back of the fish. If the fish are larger than 15 cm, the cranial cap should be opened to facili-tate fixation of the brain. The importance of these incisions cannot be over-emphasized. If the fish are too large to ship whole, cut pieces from indi-vidual tissues (gill, heart, liver, etc.), and especially any lesions observed.These pieces should not be larger than 1 cm square and 0.5 cm thick. Commercial formalin also can be used for preserving specimens and should be mixed with nine parts of water to make a 10% formalin solu-tion. Unless the lesions are very clear and obvious, always preserve sev-eral healthy specimens of the same size and age as the sick fish and sendthem at the same time in a separate container. Decontamination of Equipment and Facilities Equipment Decontamination Equipment sometimes must be decontaminated. One of the best and cheapest disinfectants is chlorine. A solution of 200 ppm will be effectiveagainst most pathogens in less than a few minutes while one of 10 ppmmay require up to several hours for sterilization. Chlorine levels aregreatly reduced by organic material such as mud, slime, and plant mate-rial; therefore, it is important to thoroughly clean equipment before it isexposed to the solution. A chlorine solution also loses strength whenexposed to the air or sunlight, so it may be necessary to add more chlo-rine or make up fresh solutions during disinfection. Chlorine may be obtained as sodium hypochlorite in either liquid or powdered form. The latter is the more stable of the two, but it is moreexpensive. The amount of chlorine added to water depends on the per-centage of available chlorine in the product used. As an example, pow-dered chlorine may contain either 15, 50, or 65% available chlorine, whileliquid solutions typically contain from 5.6% (commercial laundry bleach)to 10% available chlorine. The following amounts would be needed tomake a 200 ppm solution: \u007f 100 g (3.53 oz) of 15% available chlorine powder to 75 L (19.8 gal) of water; \u007f 100 g (3.53 oz) of 50% available chlorine powder to 250 L (66.04 gal) of water; and \u007f 100 ml (3.4 fl. oz) of 10% available chlorine solution to 50 L (13.21 gal) of water. Chlorine is acutely toxic to all life. In addition to insuring protection636 WINTON to workers applying the material, residual chlorine must be completely neutralized before it is allowed to drain or to enter waters containingfish. One hundred liters (26.4 gal) of 200 ppm chlorine solution can beneutralized by 150 g (5.3 oz) of sodium thiosulfate. Neutralization canbe easily determined with chlorine test paper or with a standard swim-ming pool test kit. Facility Decontamination With the increase in global trade, the risk of importation of exotic dis-eases has become an increasingly important threat. Also, the expansionof aquaculture has led to the emergence of new diseases for which con-trol methods are not established. For those diseases that presently can-not be treated (e.g., most viral diseases), the only successful control iscomplete elimination of all infected fish from a hatchery, thorough de-contamination of the facility, development of a new stock of disease-freefish, and maintenance of disease-free conditions throughout all futureoperations. Hatchery decontamination has been successful in removingpathogens; however, this method is practical only at those hatcherieshaving a controlled water supply originating in wells or springs thatcan be kept free of fish or a water supply treated with ozone or ultravio-let light to render it pathogen-free. Preliminary Operations Before chemical decontamination of the hatchery is started, a quaran-tine zone should be established with strict entry and exit controls. Thismay involve decontamination of all vehicles leaving the facility. Thevolumes of all incubators, troughs, raceways, or ponds must be knownor measured accurately. The areas of all contaminated surfaces in thebuildings are calculated, and allowance is made for disinfectant solu-tion to be applied on walls and floors. Then, the quantity of sodiumhypochlorite needed for a 200 ppm solution is computed. If the chlorinesolution will enter fish-bearing waters after leaving the hatchery, it willhave to be neutralized. Commercial sodium thiosulfate, used at the rateof 1.5 g for each liter of 200 ppm chlorine solution, will suffice. All loose equipment should be brought from storage rooms, scrubbed thoroughly with soap and warm water, and left near a raceway for laterdecontamination. Such equipment includes nets, buckets, pans, smalltroughs, tubs, screens, seines, boots, and rain gear. During this opera-tion, any worn-out, unnecessary, or difficult to disinfect equipment (e.g.,wooden dam boards) should be burned or otherwise destroyed. The wallsFISH HEALTH MANAGEMENT 637 of all raceways and rearing units should be scrubbed and the bottom raked. Particular attention should be given to removing any remainingfish food, pond scum, or other organic substances having a high chlo-rine demand. Elimination of Fish Prior to chemical decontamination, all fish should be destroyed by deepburial and covered with lime. The burial grounds should be so locatedthat leaching cannot recontaminate the hatchery water supply. All strayfish left in pipelines will be killed by chlorine, but it is important thattheir carcasses be retrieved and destroyed. Decontamination Decontamination methods should assure that the full strength (200 ppm)of the chlorine is maintained for at least 1 h and that a concentration ofnot less than 100 ppm is maintained for several hours. Many hatcheriesare so large that total decontamination cannot be completed in one day.Treatment then must be carried out by areas or blocks and started at theupper end of the hatchery. Before chlorine is added, all ponds, raceways, tanks, and troughs are drained. Additional dam boards, plugs, or caps are installed to holdthe water to the very top of each unit. The required quantity of chlorinethen is added gradually to the incoming water. The solution flows to thevarious rearing units, which are allowed to fill and overflow until thereis about 5 cm of the chlorine solution on the floor. The incoming waterthen is turned off or bypassed. The chlorine solution is pumped fromthe floor and sprayed on the sides and bottoms of all tanks and racks,the walls and ceiling, head trough, and any other dry equipment for 1 h.The same procedure must be used in all rooms of every building. Un-derground pipelines must be filled and flushed several times. If the hatch-ery must be decontaminated in sections, the work should be plannedand timed so that all buildings, springs, supply lines, and rearing unitscontain the maximum level of chlorine at the same time, so that no con-taminated water can enter parts of the system already treated. While amaximum concentration of chlorine is being maintained, all loose equip-ment such as pails, tubs, trays, splashboards, and other material may beimmersed in the raceways. Throughout the course of the project, checks should be made on the approximate chlorine strength with a chlorine test kit or chlorine test638 WINTON paper. If any section holds a concentration below 100 ppm chlorine after 1 h, the solution should be fortified with additional chlorine. Hatchery Maintenance After a hatchery has been decontaminated and is pathogen free, recon-tamination must be prevented. The movement of live fish into the hatch-ery should only originate from known disease-free stocks at a facilitywith a strict disease inspection program. Ideally, production should berestarted with disinfected eggs from a certified pathogen-free source.The spread of disease can be prevented only by rigid cleanliness. Allhatchery equipment should be double-checked to ensure it has beendecontaminated thoroughly before it is used and strict internal quaran-tine procedures must be followed. At some facilities, this may includethe decontamination of vehicles and equipment before they are allowedto enter the hatchery. Finally, the hatchery staff should be impressed withthe idea that one mistake may nullify all previous efforts. Acknowledgments The author is deeply indebted to Drs.
