Read on to get a sense of our philosophy and how we can help; Feeling your best is about finding balance. Often, life brings us struggles that hinder our ability to practice self care. This may lead to loss of motivation, anxiety, weight gain, mental health issues, poor self esteem, relationship and family conflict, adrenal fatigue, and worst, total physical burnout. As a leader in mental health in the Rochester community, our philosophy is centered around helping you to find your way back to your best self using a whole-person approach and cutting edge treatment(s.) This is achieved by exploring multiple facets of the individual; from the physical, to the emotional, to the behavioral, leaving no stone unturned or untreated. We combine conventional treatment with naturopathic, functional, complementary, and biomedical methods to form an integrative medicine foundation that tremendously increases positive outcomes. Your team of WWS therapists will provide an individualized treatment plan that utilizes a collaborative approach specifically tailored to your needs, allowing you to reach your goals in a shorter period of time. Many group or multi-specialist practices do not cohesively collaborate, but instead each counselor under the practice umbrella has their own set of principles, pricing, etc. At Whole Wellness, each therapist is added based on speciality and experience, and works under our treatment umbrella of principles and training, so you can be sure your experience will be consistent with our mission. With dedicated trauma, children's, marriage & family, and functional wellness teams, we meet the needs of a diverse outpatient population with ease.
