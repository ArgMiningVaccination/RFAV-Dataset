It's important that you realize, I can only talk about these 7 things because I have completely, 100% been there too! Let's face it, this is a challenging topic for so many reasons. Cleanses, diets, eating habits, and even keeping track of what you are eating can be very triggering for many. For this reason, I want to tread lightly today, and with compassion. This is coming from a place of desperately wanting to help you shift your mentality around food and how to eat for preventative health and longevity. Truthfully, although this may be a big goal for one little blog post, what I hope is that you will find your way back home, to yourself, and begin to trust and listen to your body more than you ever have before. My insight and knowledge in this area comes primarily from Traditional Chinese Medicine, so I will not be presenting you with any new information. TCM is simple, yet profound, balanced, yet incredibly impactful and as many of you know, ancient. Having been an acupuncturist for 6+ years, I understand fully that we all have our own, very unique stories around food and eating, many of which carry with them quite a lot of pain. Today, I hope to simply impart on you some of the principles that might be holding you back from feeling your best and truly stepping into your body. For the most part, the topics I go over today are relevant to most people even if you have specific dietary issues. They are fairly general and simple compared to the rainbow of diets, cleanses, and fasts out there. I will not (or ever) suggest you count calories, restrict your food, or give up things such as healthy fats. I will however, suggest that you look at how you are eating to see if any of these common \"mistakes\" might be a lightbulb moment for you. So, let's dive in shall we? Here are 7 of the reasons my cleanses have failed me in the past, maybe some also speak to you? 1. You restrict too much. You're not eating enough calories to get through the day. Such a common mistake that I have made many times. Calories are, unfortunately, not created equal. Eating half an avocado could send you over your calorie limit for the day, but eating a low-cal, low-carb lean cuisine would not. For optimal health and weight loss, we need to shift our focus from eating fake, processed food in an attempt to stay within our \"caloric allotment\" set by whomever on the interwebs to eating real, whole food. In addition, if you are cleansing, you may want to eat more because you are shifting the type of food you are eating. Listen to your body when it comes to this, I beg of you! 2. You take on too much too fast and hold yourself to impossible standards. Cleansing is like most of what we do, we get excited about it and our energy builds. As a result, we end up adding way too many things to our plate. For instance, historically, when I decided to do a Spring cleanse I would also decide to meditate every morning, hit that Zumba class in the afternoon, start training for the half marathon, or finish writing my book! You get the picture right? I'm sure you're nodding your head right about now, in fact. This is totally normal. We want to up-level, we want to feel good, so we decide to do all the things My advice?! Again, from someone who has clearly been there, tackle one thing at a time! It will be so much easier to add all that other stuff in later. 3. Your goals are only external- I want to lose 10 pounds, etc. Cleanses really could be used as a way to reset our mindset, not our scale. We oftentimes focus on numbers, inches, and dress sizes which again, are all arbitrary! They are literally about what you make them up to mean in your head. Focusing on external goals like this will have you throwing the entire program out within the first weeks when the numbers on the scale start playing ping pong. Shifting your focus to internal goals, \"I want to develop an understanding of what foods feel good in my body.\" or \"I want to find compassion for myself and begin to be present when eating and cooking.\" These will not only be easier to attain, but they will shift things for the long haul which will then (almost magically) also help you to reach those external goals. You can still have the goals, just don't have them be your main focus! 4. You only focus on the body and neglect that when you cleanse, your mind, emotions, and spirit also need support. Most of eating is about worthiness and/or control, for many of us. So when we take on cleanses or diet protocols and neglect the mind, emotion, and spirit we are setting ourselves up for failure. It may not feel like it, but we are actually doing the \"band-aid\" approach instead of fixing the root imbalance, which most likely started way back in childhood. 5. You eat too much raw food... i.e. smoothies, salads, shakes, etc. Oh, this is such a big one! People are always shocked when I introduce them to this \"new\" topic. The fact is, it's not new. It's a staple in Chinese medicine and Ayurveda but we have strayed so far from traditional medicine that almost no one can believe me. Cold and raw foods (yes, even salads) are so incredibly hard for the body to digest. Most people, and by most I mean probably 80-90% of people struggle with this. I could go on and on, but if this is something you'd like to learn more about, check out [this blog post ](https://www.holisticallyinspired.org/home/a-happy-spleen-could-help-you-lose-weight?rq=spleen)about the Spleen. 6. You forget about nourishing your hormones, blood pressure, and blood sugar, in other words... you go too long without eating! Women especially have a hard time not eating for extended periods because of their hormones and blood levels. Stability with our hormones is connected to stability with our blood sugar, which you guessed it, comes from...eating! That is, eating good quality fats, proteins, and yes... carbs! It is important for women, especially those with anemia or borderline anemia to eat regularly and factor in hormones and blood sugar 7. You focus on others' advice instead of deepening the connection to yourself and seeing what it is YOU need. Our body gives us incredible feedback, we just have to listen. Instead, especially with diets and cleanses, we look at a list someone that's never met us has made and we try our best to follow it to a T. Many of us can't, we are all so unique, special, and individualized that we can't just pop online and find a program that will work for us if it \"worked for our neighbor.\" Even if it is the best program in the universe, we have to learn to trust our gut... yes, pun intended... I couldn't miss that opportunity, now could I? I hope these make sense to you, dear one.
