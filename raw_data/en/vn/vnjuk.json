It comes with a little pouch so that you have the option to carry it with you in a pocket or bag when out and about. This set includes Amethyst, Aquamarine, Emerald, Lepidolite, Bloodstone and Clear Quartz. All sets come with a printed explanation of the properties of the crystals used. Amethyst reinforces the immune system. Considered a natural tranquillizer, it relieves stress and nervous system disorders, promoting tranquillity. It helps combat insomnia and protects against nightmares by inducing restful sleep. Amethyst balances our emotional highs and lows and is a valuable aid in eliminating anger, fear, and anxiety. Aquamarine is an excellent choice for alleviating excessive immune reactions. Its power is enhanced when used in conjunction with emerald. Known as a stone of courage, aquamarine transmits the strength to meet any challenge. It brings soothing energies that help diminish stress and calm the mind. A powerful ally of the immune system, emerald can help us remain in good health when our body's natural defences are low. It regenerates the physical body and contributes to rapid recovery and can heal or calm negative emotions, lifting depression and providing peace. It ensures physical, emotional, and mental balance. Lepidolite is a strong purification tool that dispels all negativity. A calming stone, it relieves sleep disorders. It's also extremely useful in eliminating stress, depression, and mood swings. Bloodstone is a powerful healer and energy cleanser and is one of the best immune boosters. Bloodstone re-energises and rejuvenates when the body and mind are exhausted. Clear Quartz is known as the \"master healer\" and will amplify energy and thought, as well as the effect of other crystals. It absorbs, stores, releases and regulates energy. Clear Quartz draws off negative energy of all kinds, neutralising background radiation, including electromagnetic smog or petrochemical emanations. It balances and revitalises the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual planes. Cleanses and enhances the organs and subtle bodies and acts as a deep soul cleanser, connecting the physical dimension with the mind. $25.00 The Abundance Tumble Stone Set includes Citrine, Jade, Tiger Eye, Pyrite, and Carnelian.
