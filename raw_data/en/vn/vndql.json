Since the emergence of COVID, I have been committed to helping as many people as possible take good care of themselves and their health. I feel it is a great privilege to tirelessly educate and show practical ways in which we can meet the current health challenges. Recently, I have been experiencing an increase in inquiries from people who are suffering from vaccination consequences and are looking for promising treatment options. This is in line with the experience of doctors and therapists worldwide. People are speaking up everywhere about the health effects that the new types of vaccines have on the human body. This inevitably raises the question of how toxins contained in these vaccines can be removed from the body and how patients can be treated effectively. This gave rise to my desire to dedicate an online summit to the subject of vaccination detoxification. With this Vaccine Detox Summit\", I aim to provide physicians, therapists, and those affected with viable treatment options. It is my pleasure for me to have as many experts as possible share their approach to the topic and through this diversity, hopefully offer something for everyone who participates.

The online summit for post-vaccine syndrome and long COVID Schedule & Interview Topics Day 1 - July 05, 2023 Day 2 - July 06, 2023 Day 3 - July 07, 2023 Day 4 - July 08, 2023 Day 5 - July 09, 2023 Summit Host Dr. Alina Lessenich After completing my training as a veterinarian, I increasingly suffered from chronic health issues. I experienced what it means to reach the boundries of conventional medicine. These circumstances led me to research and test what could really help me on my way to better health. Through my passion for studying scientific literature and getting to the bottom of things, I amassed a wealth of knowledge, which I wanted to make available to others to support their holistic self-help. So, in November 2020, I created my own Telegram channel, which has about 75,000 members. Soon after, I posted my first Vaccine Detox Protocol\" online, which has since been downloaded over 1,5 million times and gratefully used by countless people. Since then, I have continued to follow the vaccination issue and publish the latest findings on this subject. Over the past few months, it has become increasingly clear that a large number of people is struggling with vaccine adverse events. For this reason, I decided to dedicate my first online summit to the subject of Vaccination Detoxification\" in addition to offering Zoom calls, interviews, and workshops. It is a matter close to my heart to show those affected how they can successfully detox vaccines or treat vaccine adverse events. At the same time, I would like to raise awareness for this topic among the general public and provide valuable impulses for physicians and therapists.
