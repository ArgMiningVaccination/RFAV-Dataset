Lancet Reg Health Am ; 19: 100445, 2023 Mar. Artigo ABSTRACT Background:Breakthrough [vaccination]against COVID-19 are of international concern. [Patients]with [cancer]have been observed to have worse outcomes associated with COVID-19 during the [pandemic]. We sought to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of [patients]with [cancer] [who]developed breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections after 2 or 3 doses of [mRNA vaccines]. Methods:We evaluated the clinical characteristics 2022, to allow for a contemporary unvaccinated control [population]; potential differences were evaluated using a multivariable [logistic regression]model after inverse [probability]of [treatment]weighting and 95% was 30-day of which 564 and 385 had received 2 or 3 doses of an [mRNA] [vaccine]prior to [infection], respectively. [Hematologic malignancies]and recent receipt anti-neoplastic [therapy]were more frequent among vaccinated [patients]. [Vaccination]was associated with outcomes:in the primary [analysis], 2 (aOR 0.62, 95% and 3 doses (aOR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.36) were associated with decreased 30-day [mortality]. There were [similar]findings for the key [secondary]endpoints of ICU/MV 0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.75 and 0.35, 95% CI 0.26-0.46) for 2 and 3 doses, respectively. Importantly, Black [patients]had higher rates of [hospitalization](aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.06-2.44). Interpretation: [Vaccination]against COVID-19, especially with additional doses, is a fundamental strategy in the prevention of adverse outcomes including [death], among [patients]with [cancer].
