Are they safe? How do they work? By Cathy Wong Updated on July 31, 2023 Medically reviewed by Kashif J. Piracha, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents What Is a Kidney Cleanse? Should You Do a Kidney Cleanse? Components of a Kidney Cleanse Caring for Your Kidneys Frequently Asked Questions Kidney detox, sometimes called a kidney cleanse, relies on a process or a product (like apple cider vinegar or ginger) that's said to help remove toxins from the kidneys. Cleanses may have health benefits, but more scientific evidence is needed to support the idea that eating certain foods and taking specific vitamins improves kidney health. Apart from a kidney detox, there are steps you can take to promote kidney health. Limiting the salt in your diet, drinking more water, and managing cholesterol and blood pressure levels are all lifestyle changes that promote kidney health. This article will explain what a kidney cleanse is and the claims about what it can do for your health. It also discusses concerns about kidney detox and some healthy choices you can make instead. Paloma Gatrel / FOAP / Getty Images What Is a Kidney Cleanse? Kidney detox (typically a food, specialized diet, or product) can help cleanse the kidneys, according to its proponents. Kidneys are bean-shaped organs found under the rib cage in your lower back. They remove excess water and waste products from your blood, so promoting their health is important. In general, though, the kidneys don't require any special \"cleaning.\" Your kidneys should function just fine if you drink enough water and eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Males should drink 13 cups of water each day, and females should drink nine. Most adult males should eat 5 1/2 cups of fruits and vegetables, though this varies by age and sex. It's 4 cups for adult females. Kidneys also release three important hormones: Erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells Renin, which regulates blood pressure Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D to maintain bone health and chemical balance in the body A poor diet and chronic stress can impair health, including your renal (kidney) function. Toxic exposure can cause injury to the kidneys. While a kidney cleanse may appeal to you, proceed carefully. The scientific evidence is limited on whether and how a cleanse improves kidney health or prevents infection. For example, apple cider vinegar has antioxidant properties and it may offer health benefits, like preventing kidney stones. Research in animals suggests apple cider vinegar shows promise but there's not yet clear evidence of its health benefits for human kidneys. Does Kidney Detox Offer Benefits? Kidney detox is touted as a way to prevent kidney stones that can develop from calcium, uric acid, and oxalate buildup in your urine. Kidney cleanses also are said to help keep blood pressure in check, improve urinary function, boost immunity, and clear toxins from the body. The benefits are not proven, and some people using strict kidney detox plans have encountered serious complications. 1:56 Click Play to Learn How to Do a Natural Kidney Cleanse This video has been medically reviewed by Meredith Bull, ND. Should You Do a Kidney Cleanse? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require manufacturers who make kidney cleansing products to prove that their methods are safe and effective. So consumers must be careful about the products they consume based on the labels they read. Talk with your healthcare provider if you want to take a truly natural approach to improve your kidney health. Or, consider consulting a qualified integrative healthcare professional. It's especially important to talk with your provider if you have a specific health status, like pregnancy or underlying kidney disease, or if you plan a kidney detox for children. How to Do a Detox Cleanse At Home Components of a Kidney Cleanse Kidney detox plans include a number of products and approaches to cleansing the kidneys. Herbal Kidney Cleanse Herbal kidney cleanses are typically given as a tea consumed two or three times a day. Often, they are recommended in addition to a food-based kidney cleanse. Some herbal ingredients that are claimed to treat kidney injury include: Resveratrol, an anti-inflammatory found in grapes and berries Ginger, believed to limit kidney toxicity Ginseng, which may help with cisplatin (chemotherapy) toxicity Black nightshade plants containing flavonoids and alkaloids Turmeric, thought to reduce urea, prevent inflammation in the kidneys, and help expel waste. Other claims about kidney detox remedies include dandelion tea, nettles. These herbs may act as diuretics, which helps flush out the kidneys and remove excess waste. Talk to your healthcare provider before taking herbs to cleanse your kidneys, especially if you have kidney stones or other urinary tract problems. A dietitian can also give you information about how these herbs might affect your health. Symptoms of Kidney Disease Foods for Kidney Cleanse Food-based kidney cleanses differ in what you eat and for how long. In general, however, these cleanses direct you to eat a restricted diet of only certain foods for a few days. These diets may consist of juices, smoothies, or a list of specific foods. Again, consult your healthcare provider or a dietitian to make sure it is safe for you to follow a cleanse plan. Some kidney cleanses emphasize: Beet juice, to improve blood flow to the kidneys. A small 2021 study found no real benefit. Watermelon and lemon juice. Fruits that contain citric acid are believed to help prevent kidney stones. Citric acid binds to calcium, which prevents the growth of calcium crystals. Cranberry juice. There is limited evidence that cranberries may help prevent urinary tract infections. Pumpkin seeds. Pumpkin seeds are thought to prevent the accumulation of uric acid, one of the compounds that cause kidney stones. Vitamins for Kidney Cleanse Some proponents recommend incorporating the following vitamins and minerals into a kidney cleanse. In many cases, a kidney cleanse will involve dietary restrictions along with vitamin supplementation including: Vitamin B2Vitamin B6Magnesium A study of 1,312 adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and therefore at higher risk for kidney-related complications, looked at Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplements to see if they helped to protect kidney function. Neither proved to do so. Some research shows that a high intake of calcium through foods (milk, yogurt) may decrease the risk of developing kidney stones, according to the National Kidney Foundation. Ironically, taking calcium in supplement form may do just the opposite: It could increase the risk. Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease: What Is the Relationship? Caring for Your Kidneys Some methods to improve kidney health are supported by science. You may wish to consider them before trying a kidney cleanse: Avoid smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol and caffeine.Maintain normal blood pressure and blood sugar levels.Keep your cholesterol under control.Drink enough water and other fluids.Maintain a healthy weight. Although there is no evidence that a kidney cleanse can help prevent kidney stones, you may reduce your risk by drinking enough fluids and cutting back on sodium. People with a history of kidney stones may want to avoid foods rich in oxalic acid (oxalates), such as chocolate, sweet potatoes, spinach, and almond and cashew nuts. Healthy diets that protect renal function are especially important for people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Some experts recommend a whole food, plant-based diet that's high in fiber, vitamins and minerals. They've also found some evidence to suggest that plant-based proteins (peas, beans, nuts) don't lead to acidity affecting the kidneys, as animal proteins do. What Is the Best Drink to Flush Your Kidneys? Water is the best thing to drink for healthy kidneys. It's usually recommended that adults drink eight glasses of water per day. That amount can vary, though, based on your age, health, and physical activity. Especially if you have kidney disease, talk to your healthcare provider about how much water you should take in each day. Summary The goal of a kidney cleanse is to detoxify the kidneys to promote healthy kidneys and prevent kidney stones. Herbs, vitamins, and healthy foods often are part of the regimen. In the end, a kidney cleanse won't hurt you, but there's little evidence that kidney detox improves kidney health either. General good-for-your-health measures like drinking plenty of water, eating a healthy diet, and managing your blood pressure are the best ways to keep your kidneys functioning well. Prevent Kidney Stones With Diet and Nutrition Frequently Asked Questions Can a kidney cleanse harm your kidneys? In rare instances, a cleanse that included a large amount of oxalates could cause kidney damage. Leafy greens, legumes, and other vegetables that are extremely beneficial to your health can lead to a condition known as oxalate nephropathy if you have certain underlying issues and you consume more than your body can process. Oxalate nephropathy may be treated, but in some cases, it can lead to end-stage renal disease. Learn More: Symptoms of ESRD How do I get rid of kidney stones naturally? If a stone is small, you may be able to pass it without needing any special treatment. Drink plenty of water and take acetaminophen to help manage the pain while your body passes the stone. Acetic acid (which is found in apple cider vinegar) and citrate (found in lemon juice concentrate) have been shown to help prevent kidney stones, but these natural remedies may not help with stones that are already formed.
