She also treats digestive issues including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), constipation and heartburn, as well as pre-menstrual, menstrual, and post-menopausal issues, anxiety, insomnia and fatigue. Philosophy of Care My inherent faith in the self-regulating wisdom of nature has been strengthened by my experience as an Ayurveda practitioner and Osteopathic physician. My Western medical education and practice has given me great appreciation for today's science and technology. By combining these sources of training and experience, I am happy to offer a comprehensive approach to health and healing: Eastern and Western; balancing ancient wisdom with the knowledge of new scientific discoveries. At the beginning of our partnership as patient and provider, we create a comprehensive assessment of your health: I ask about your past and current history, medications, supplements and prior complementary treatments. I also look at your family medical history, as well as your social and occupational experiences. We discuss what makes you happy and what creates stress for you. I also assess your physical and mental constitution from an Osteopathic and Ayurvedic perspective, simultaneously keeping in mind the tenets of Western medicine. Important information about your health can be gathered from cues such as your vital signs, posture, voice, skin, pulse, tongue, heart and lungs. In other words, I put together the pieces of the puzzle that make you a unique individual. From there we consider a range of treatment options, including therapies available through our integrative team, and recommendations that may include lifestyle and dietary changes, brief courses of herbal supplementation, Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT), meditation, pranayama (breath control), yoga practices, routines tailored to seasonal changes, and exercise. Therapy is tailored to fit your needs and your ability to make realistic and sustainable changes toward better health. Physicians Nearby [Jeff A.
