The purpose of this supplement is to support the implementation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s COVID-19 vaccine confidence strategy by funding the Connecting Behavioral Science to COVID-19 Vaccine Demand (CBS-CVD) Network, to identify key behavioral insights that will inform effective solutions to increase confidence in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, and ultimately uptake. As COVID-19 vaccines continue to roll out, high uptake of the vaccines is necessary to reduce the burden of disease and control the pandemic. The overarching goal of the project is to ensure high uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines in rural areas of Colorado by utilizing the CDC's Vaccinate with Confidence Strategy for COVID-19 vaccines, which emphases the need to: 1) build trust in the vaccine, the vaccinator, and the health system; 2) empower healthcare personnel; and 3) engage communities and individuals. We will accomplish these objectives via the following specific aims: 1) develop a community advisory council (CAC) to inform all stages of the proposed project (this aim will allow us to utilize existing expertise and leverage extant partnerships to maximize efforts and mobilize quickly); and 2) implement and evaluate evidenced-based, multi-level behavioral interventions that will increase vaccine access and reduce vaccine hesitancy to ensure high uptake of vaccines in two rural Colorado regions (a total of nine counties). This stakeholder map plots organizations that are working to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Colorado. The goal of this map is to provide a resource to help individuals and public health partners identify and understand current efforts to increase vaccine uptake in their communities. "}
