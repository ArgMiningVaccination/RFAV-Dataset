For so long I could not figure out why I was breaking out in hives after every meal. The previous allergist I saw in Tampa only texted me for shellfish and seafood and nothing really conclusive came of it. Thankfully Dr. Stewart was able to figure out that I am allergic to garlic and onions (they're in everything.) He is incredibly kind and knowledgeable of allergy. He provides care with what's best in mind. He listens to my concerns and is encouraging to come back if something doesn't work out. The staff at this location is very nice and willing to work with you for scheduling. Overall just a nice place with nice people and I really would recommend Dr. Stewart for anyone in the area in need of quality and caring allergy care. - 11/22/2019 Beau Caruthers is an EXCELLENT practitioner. He's extremely knowledgeable, caring, and thorough. I also work in the healthcare industry and I continue to be impressed each time I have an appointment with this guy! He's the best and I will continue coming here and entrusting my care to this awesome ARNP. Beau, if you ever decide you want to change over the the ortho side of medicine I would gladly hire you in a minute. I would trust both my patients and my very own family's care to your capable hands!
