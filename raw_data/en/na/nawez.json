Methods We surveyed subjects 65 years who received either HD or SD vaccine at the Minneapolis Veteran Affairs Health Care System clinics on October 27, 28, or 29, 2015. Research assistants conducted a 17-item telephone survey of influenza vaccine recipients to inquire about self-reported health and symptoms experienced the week after vaccination. Results A total of 547 HD recipients and 541 SD recipients responded to the survey. The 2 groups were similar at baseline with respect to age, gender, and presence of high-risk medical conditions. At least 95% of individuals in both HD and SD groups reported that their overall health was the same or better than usual during the week after vaccination. Thirty-seven percent of HD recipients and 22% of SD recipients reported a local or systemic side effect (P < .001), most of which were mild to moderate. Only 7 of 547 (1.3%) HD recipients and 3 of 541 (0.6%) SD recipients reported a severe side effect (P = .34). There was no significant difference in healthcare visits between the groups. Conclusions Side effects were more common among subjects 65 years who received HD influenza vaccine compared with SD vaccine. These side effects were well tolerated and were not associated with impairment of general health status. These findings should reassure patients and their providers of the safety and tolerability of the HD influenza vaccine. The risk of severe complications and death from influenza increases with age, especially above 65 years [ [1-4](#CIT0001)]. Influenza vaccination in adults 65 years (hereby referred to as elderly) decreases the incidence of clinical disease and might reduce the risk of secondary complications, hospitalization, and death related to influenza [ [5-12](#CIT0005)]. However, the elderly may have reduced immune response to the vaccine and protection when compared with healthy younger adults [ [13](#CIT0013), [14](#CIT0014)]. In 2009, an (Fluzone High-Dose; Sanofi-Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in individuals 65 years [ [15](#CIT0015)]. The trivalent, HD vaccine induces a superior immune response compared with the trivalent, standard dose (SD) vaccine in adults 65 years [ [16-19](#CIT0016)]. Compared with SD vaccine, the HD vaccine has also been shown to provide enhanced clinical protection against influenza disease and decreased influenza-related medical encounters and hospitalizations [ [20](#CIT0020), [21](#CIT0021)]. However, in a prelicensure clinical trial, the HD vaccine was also associated with higher rates of local and systemic symptoms, including higher rates of severe reactions [ [18](#CIT0018)]. Perceived side effects of influenza vaccines have historically been a major barrier preventing full-scale vaccination [ [22-26](#CIT0022)]. Concerns about the possibility of a higher rate of side effects with the HD vaccine compared with SD vaccine may represent a significant hurdle to use of this vaccine for providers and patients. We conducted this survey of ambulatory patients 65 years of age attending influenza vaccination clinics during the 2015-2016 influenza season to provide additional information about the rates of self-reported local and systemic symptoms experienced during the week after the HD vaccine compared with the SD vaccine. METHODS We surveyed patients 65 years who attended walk-in influenza vaccination clinics on October 27-29, 2015 at sites within the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. These sites included the Minneapolis VA Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota as well as 4 community-based outpatient clinics located in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Minneapolis VA Health Care System offered trivalent, inactivated, SD influenza vaccine and trivalent, inactivated, HD influenza vaccine (both manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur) during the 2015-2016 influenza vaccination season. The Minneapolis VA strongly encouraged subjects 65 years to receive the HD vaccine if it was available. However, if the HD vaccine was not available, subjects were advised to receive the SD vaccine. During the first 1\u00bd days of the 3-day influenza vaccination clinics, there was a shortage of HD vaccine and only SD vaccine was available. However, during the remaining 1\u00bd days of the walk-in clinics, both SD and HD vaccines were available with HD vaccine being preferentially offered to all elderly persons. Vaccine recipients were notified with pamphlets at the time of their vaccination that they might be contacted at a later date to participate in a survey assessing their health after vaccination. We obtained a list of all patients 65 years who received either the HD or the SD influenza vaccine at the influenza vaccination clinics on October 27, 28, and 29, 2015. Trained research personnel used a randomly ordered version of this list to call subjects from November 30, 2015 to January 11, 2016. We attempted to call each recipient only once. The research personnel were blinded to the type of vaccine that the recipient received. Subjects on the list were called sequentially until over 500 people in each group responded. The telephone survey was a 17-item structured questionnaire with predefined categories to ascertain the presence, severity, and duration of self-reported symptoms experienced during the week after vaccination. The questions were designed to inquire about symptoms that have been previously attributed to influenza vaccination and were adapted from a prior study also assessing rates of side effects in elderly adults after influenza vaccination [ [27](#CIT0027)]. The surveyor specifically asked about general health status, fever, myalgias (\"muscle aches\"), fatigue (\"tiredness\"), headaches, and upper respiratory symptoms. The surveyor also asked about local symptoms of arm soreness and arm swelling. For each symptom, vaccine recipients were asked to categorize the severity into mild, moderate, or severe categories and describe the impact of the symptom on daily life. Data are summarized using means and standard deviations of continuous variables and proportions for categorical data expressed as percentages. Proportions were compared using a 2-group 2 test, and means were compared using the Student t test. All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Cited P values are not corrected for the number of comparisons. The study was approved by the Minneapolis VA Research and Development Committee. RESULTS A total of 2709 patients 65 years received influenza vaccine during the study period at the participating sites. This included 1211 patients who received the HD vaccine and 1498 patients who received a SD vaccine. On the first day of the vaccination clinic, 76% of patients 65 years of age who were vaccinated received the SD vaccine, and on the third (last) day of the vaccination clinics, 85% of vaccinated patients 65 years of age received the HD vaccine. We attempted to reach 1134 HD recipients with a phone call and received responses from 547 (48%). For SD recipients, we attempted to reach 1061 with a phone call and received responses from 541 (51%). Once contacted, greater than 98% of patients agreed to participate in the survey. A total of 82% of all surveys were completed by week 7 after vaccination, with the remaining completed over the next 3 weeks. Baseline characteristics of the survey respondents are shown in [Table 1](/pmc/articles/PMC5414012/table/T1/). The HD and SD vaccine recipient groups were not significantly different with respect to age, gender, health status, presence of high-risk medical conditions, and previous receipt of influenza vaccinations. Table 1. |Characteristics of Survey Respondents||High Dose n (%)||Standard (58%)| |Reported that they received a flu shot every year for the prior 5 years||469 (86%)||469 (87%)| |First time receipt of influenza vaccine over 5 years||7 (1.3%)||8 (1.5%)| aThe P values were >.05 in all categories when comparing high-dose and standard dose subjects. Ninety-five percent of HD recipients and 96% of SD recipients reported that their overall health was the same or better than usual during the week after their vaccination ( [Table 2](/pmc/articles/PMC5414012/table/T2/)). The proportion of subjects who reported a side effect did not vary by the week they were called in either HD or SD category. Furthermore, subjects who were first-time influenza vaccine recipients were as likely to have side effects compared with persons who had previously received influenza vaccines in the past 5 years (3 of 15 vs 317 of 1071; P = .6). Overall, 200 of 547 (37%) of HD vaccine recipients and 120 of 540 (22%) of SD vaccine recipients reported a local or systemic side effect during the week after vaccination (P < .001). Most of these side effects were mild to moderate, with only 7 of 547 (1.3%) of HD vaccine recipients and 3 of 541 (0.6%) of SD vaccine recipients reporting any severe local or systemic side effect (P = .34). However, 20 of 547 (3.7%) of HD vaccine recipients reported having to cut down on usual activities due to any side effect vs 7 of 541 (1.3%) of SD recipients (P = .01). The difference in healthcare visits due to side effects between the 2 groups was not significant (0.9% vs 0.6%; P = .48). Table 2. |Health Status||High Dose n = 547 (1.3%)||.01| |Emergency department/ urgent care/primary adverse symptom||5 (0.9%)||3 (0.6%)||.48|[Table 3](/pmc/articles/PMC5414012/table/T3/) summarizes the types, severity, and duration of local and systemic side effects reported by HD and SD vaccine recipients. Rates of a local side effect were higher among the HD vaccine recipients (30% vs 18%; P .001), with arm soreness accounting for these differences. However, in both groups the arm soreness was generally mild to moderate, lasted 48 hours, and generally did not interfere with daily activities. High-dose vaccine recipients also reported higher rates of systemic side effects than did SD vaccine recipients (11.4% vs 6%; P = .002). Generalized myalgias and fatigue were more common among the HD vaccine recipients, but most of these symptoms were mild or moderate. Only 5 of 547 (0.9%) of the HD vaccine recipients and 2 of 541 (0.4%) SD vaccine recipients reported severe systemic symptoms (P = .26).

There was no difference in rates of local or systemic side effects to either vaccine when stratified by either baseline health or presence of a high-risk condition (data not shown). However, when we stratified side effects by age group dichotomized as 65-74 years and 75 years, the incidence of any side effect was higher in the younger age group (65-74 years) for both HD and SD recipients ( [Figure 1A](/pmc/articles/PMC5414012/figure/F1/)). This difference in the HD category was mostly driven by the higher rate of local reactions in the younger age groups ( [Figure 1B](/pmc/articles/PMC5414012/figure/F1/) and [andC).C](/pmc/articles/PMC5414012/figure/F1/)). The proportion of persons who were first-time influenza vaccine recipients over the last 5 years was not significantly different in the 65-74 year group compared with the 75 year group (12 of 755 vs 3 of 331; P = .54). The risk of a severe side effect was low and not significantly different between the 2 age groups. Although most subjects in both HD and SD groups expressed their intention to continue getting an annual influenza vaccine, 13 of 1088 (1.2%) individuals stated that they did not plan to get the influenza vaccine the following year. Persons who expressed not wanting to receive an influenza vaccine the next year when compared with all other influenza vaccine recipients were similar in age, but they were more likely to be first-time influenza vaccine recipients (3 of 13 vs 12 of 1075; P < .0001) and were more likely to have experienced a severe side effect after receiving the vaccine (2 of 13 vs 8 of 1075; P < .0001). Vaccine type (HD vs SD) was not associated with intent to be vaccinated in the future. DISCUSSION In this study of subjects 65 years attending walk-in influenza vaccination clinics, we found that HD vaccine recipients reported higher rates of local and systemic side effects compared with SD vaccine recipients, but rates of severe symptoms were low and similar between the 2 groups. Previous prelicensure studies evaluating immunogenicity and safety of HD vaccine have also demonstrated higher rates of local and systemic symptoms with the HD vaccine compared with SD [ [16-19](#CIT0016)]. In the pivotal, prelicensure immunogenicity trial, HD vaccine was associated with a 34% incidence of a systemic reaction and a 36% incidence of local reaction compared with the SD group, which experienced a 29% rate of a systemic reaction and 24% rate of a local reaction [ [18](#CIT0018)]. In our study, we found a similar trend, with an overall lower rate of systemic side effects. Systemic side effects occurred in 11.4% of the HD group compared with 6% in the SD group, and local side effects occurred in 30% of the HD group compared with 18% for the SD group. In contrast to these findings for the HD vaccine, trials among the elderly have demonstrated that SD vaccines when compared with placebo injections cause a higher rate of local side effects, but the rate of systemic side effects is no different [ [27](#CIT0027), [28](#CIT0028)]. Our results show that despite the higher rates of local and systemic symptoms, HD vaccine recipients had similar rates of same or better health status after vaccination as the SD vaccine recipients, and HD vaccine recipients did not report significantly higher rates of healthcare utilization due to symptoms after vaccination. Our survey research is a detailed, postlicensure, real-world study of the frequency and severity of side effects with HD vaccine when compared with SD vaccine. We are unaware of any other postlicensure HD vaccine studies examining this issue. We took advantage of unexpected delays in availability of HD influenza vaccine during the 3-day walk-in vaccination clinics to study a natural experiment in which only the SD vaccine was available for the first half of the time period, whereas both vaccines were available during the second half of the study period. This resulted in >1000 subjects 65 years receiving each of the vaccines over the 3-day time period. This facilitated a balanced distribution of patient characteristics between HD and SD vaccine recipients and allowed us to compare experiences with HD as well as SD vaccine in a cohort of subjects 65 years. Other strengths of our study include a large sample size, recruitment from various locations in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and blinding of the interviewers to the type of vaccine received. Our study was an observational study, and as such it has several potential limitations. Several types of biases may have affected our results. One bias is due to lack of randomization of subjects, although the baseline characteristics between HD and SD subjects were similar. Another is the possibility of recall bias because subjects were questioned 4 to 10 weeks after vaccination. Given the delay in interview, it was reassuring to us that the proportion of subjects who reported any side effect did not vary by the week they were called. Another limitation is the self-report of presence and severity of symptoms. However, the similarity of our findings to the prior report in the literature supports the validity of our findings [ [18](#CIT0018)]. Our survey study had a response rate of approximately 48% in the SD vaccine recipients and 51% in the HD vaccine recipients, which is similar to other telephone survey studies in the literature [ [29-31](#CIT0029)]. More than 98% of the nonrespondents were patients who could not be contacted over the phone, but because these patients may be different from the subjects we surveyed, our results should be interpreted with some caution. Finally, most of our subjects were males. Prior placebo-controlled studies of adverse reactions to influenza vaccine in the elderly have shown that women may be more likely to have local and systemic side effects compared with men [ [28](#CIT0028), [32](#CIT0032)]. Hence, our findings on side effects in a study in which 99% of the population studied were men should be generalized to women with some caution. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that side effects were more common among subjects 65 years who received HD influenza vaccine compared with SD vaccine. These side effects were generally well tolerated, were not significantly more likely to be severe, and were not associated with an impairment of general health status or with increased healthcare utilization. The increased frequency of side effects also did not adversely affect the proportion of HD vaccine recipients in their intent to continue getting vaccinated in the future. These findings should reassure patients and their providers of the safety and tolerability of the HD influenza vaccine. Acknowledgments We thank Tom Rector for help with statistical analysis.
