The Westminster site, located in a large converted inn beside a highway in northern Massachusetts, offers residential treatment and medical detox for individuals struggling with substance misuse and [dual diagnosis](https://recovery.org/topics/dual-diagnosis-recovery/). It's one of the [24.2 percent](https://wwwdasis.samhsa.gov/webt/state_data/MA17.pdf) of facilities in Massachusetts that operate on a private, for-profit basis, and one of just [eight non-hospital, residential facilities](https://wwwdasis.samhsa.gov/webt/state_data/MA17.pdf) in the state that provide detox on-site. TREATMENT & ASSESSMENT In order to be admitted, clients can call the facility directly to speak with someone 24 hours per day, seven days per week. An initial free, confidential assessment is conducted and, upon establishing a start date, the facility will send out a \"black car service\" to pick up the client at their door. Once they arrive, clients participate in biopsychosocial, medical, and psychiatric evaluations to determine the best course of treatment. Detoxing clients receive 24-hour nursing care and medications to ease the symptoms of withdrawal. Treatment at RCA is multidisciplinary, drawing on the 12-Steps as well as evidence-based methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication-assisted treatment (MAT), though the medications currently in use are not specified. Trauma-informed therapy is provided in individual, group, and family settings, and when they're not in counseling or psychiatric sessions, residents can participate in yoga, spiritual coaching, art and music therapy, and sober outings. Coaching is also provided on diet, nutrition, fitness, and wellness, to ensure that residents can continue to lead healthy, sober lives after treatment. Residents plan for discharge throughout treatment, and when they graduate, they're invited to attend alumni meetings, of which there are several every week, run the by alumni association. Clients' families are also invited to attend 12-step meetings on-site. STAFF CREDENTIALS The treatment team includes a physician and master's level counselors.

The five individuals polled by Rehabs.com to date on the center's amenities appreciated the quality of the facilities. Cleanliness: 4.8/5 Exercise and Leisure: 4.4/5 WHAT ALUMNI SAY All three alumni polled by Rehabs.com to date gave very positive feedback. \"Excellent program,\" K.M. wrote simply, while both Benjamin and Ryan praised the center's staff. \"The staff was very patient and tolerant... Staff the is very experienced in addiction and recovery as well as the medical staff,\" Benjamin wrote in a representative comment. Ryan also added praise for the center's amenities, writing: \"This facility is absolutely incredible... They offer yoga, art therapy, gym time, pool time, personal training on weekends.\" The only alum polled on the facility's offerings in a variety of treatment metrics, Benjamin, gave the center four stars for its family participation, discharge practices, and holistic offerings. At the time of this writing, secondary sites yielded mostly positive feedback, with some notes of complaint. The center has average ratings of 3.7 stars based on 23 opinions on Facebook (where the facility can curate its own page) and 4.3 stars based on 29 reviews on Google, plus a one-star rating and a four-star rating on Yelp. The positive reviewers tended to echo praise from alumni polled by Rehabs.com, focusing on the staff and the efficacy of treatment. \"Great place, great staff, and learning environment... Your not just a waking $ amount in there like some of the state run facilities, the staff genuinely care,\" Dan wrote in a representative comment on Facebook.

Unprofessional,\" Nicholas wrote in one such comment on Google. WHAT FAMILY & FRIENDS SAY Of the four loved ones polled by Rehabs.com to date, one gave a very negative review and the rest gave very positive feedback. Negative reviewer G's complaint took issue with luxury rehabs in general, not with the provisions at RCA in particular.

The reviewers repeatedly praised the center's staff and welcoming environment. \"Very friendly staff,very nice facility.

But K.M. disagreed, writing: \"Patients don't get treatment they are just dollar signs that management tries to keep them happy so they don't leaven.
