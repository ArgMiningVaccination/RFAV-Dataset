Everyone dies eventually. Yet despite itsinevitability, death and dying scenarios represent one of life's most challengingareas of communication. This study delves into this important area of research byfocusing a narrow lens on possibly the most unwanted deaths of all: those ofchildren and young people.Using a narrative methodology, the research presents the stories of 13children and young people with terminal or advanced illnesses, and the stories ofsome of their family members. Thematic findings include (1) acceptance anddetermination; (2) communication and 'straight talk'; (3) sense-making; (7) natural alliances; and (8)viiindividuality. The study suggests applied perspectives within the context ofinterpersonal and organizational strategies, including conceptualizations ofpresence, listening, uncertainty expectation, internal sense-making, and languagephraseology. The study concludes by offering future considerations within therealm of public policy and specific future research questions within the theoreticalcontexts of symbolic interactionism and identity.viiiTable of ContentsList Protocol..............................................................294Appendix F: Tree................................................................2931CHAPTER 1:THE JOURNEYWithin a 12-day period I had the privilege of sitting next to 2 women asthey took their last breaths. The women were mother and daughter. Combinedthey were 2 of the most influential and loved individuals in my life, my 72-year-old mother, Irma Jeanne Chatelle, and her mother, my 92-year-old grandmother,Faye Farley.Up until age 42, I had never actually seen anyone die. Nor had I ever heldthe hands of someone as she breathed her last breaths, and then waited to see ifanything else happened. Never before had I looked at a medical professional andsaid through my tears, \"Is she actually dead now?\" Nor had I ever helped funeralhome people put a person in a body bag. The deaths and lives of these 2remarkable women fundamentally changed my own life.One of the deaths was expected, that of my beloved mother. She hadbattled cancer intermittently for 17 years with a strong will, unimaginableperseverance, a heart of gold, and the gift of humor until the bitter end. She usedto tell my father he was going to be very popular with the ladies after she diedbecause he was one of the few old men in their town who could drive at night.After undergoing her second mastectomy, she would often laugh and say, \"Thank2God that's over.\" Later, when she was diagnosed with lung cancer despite havingquit smoking more than 30 years before, she said with a sad and ironic smile,\"Perhaps I spoke too soon.\"We were first told in August of 1999 that my mother would probably diethat month. She did not. She held on to soak up days of going to a few moregarage sales, winning a few more hands of poker, telling a few more jokes,spending a little more time with her treasured granddaughters Lauren and Rachel,celebrating her 72nd birthday, and living through\u2014albeit in a very compromisedphysical state\u2014one last Thanksgiving.In this last stage, my father, sister, nieces, and I would sit together with mymother just to be near her because she was always the life of the party\u2014and weall knew the party was quickly coming to an end. We would tell jokes, play cards,remember stories, create Beanie Baby puppet shows with my nieces, laugh atstupid things on television, listen to music, and so on. Yet as the days and weeksturned into months during which my mother steadily declined, no longer couldour own stamina or schedules sustain a 24-hour group vigil. Thus we began takingturns.My mother actually died on November 30\u20143 months after she wassupposed to. In what appeared to be another routine evening of handholding,touching, and monitoring her breathing, I whispered to my mother, who wascomatose at the time, that dad was going out for a quick walk around the block,3and that he would be right back. No sooner had my dad left the house and shut thedoor behind him than I noticed a change in my mother's labored breathing.Although this had happened before, something seemed different this time. Mom'sbreathing seemed thinner than usual.I did not know whether to leave my mother and run after my dad, but Iwas afraid that Mom might die alone. So I stayed and continued to hold her handand tell her everything would be fine, hoping my dad would walk back in thedoor.Throughout the next several minutes I thought to myself how inadequate Ifelt in terms of what to say to Mom through my tears, even though I had dutifullypoured through a stack of how-to-care-for-the-dying books. All I could seem tospit out was \"I love you,\" \"We'll take care of each other here,\" \"We'll see youagain,\" \"It's OK to let go if you want to,\" and \"Everything will be fine.\" In a fewminutes my mother took one last stutter of a breath. As I continued to hold herhand, my eyes went back and forth from her contorted face to the ticking of theclock to see if anything else would happen. Nothing did. After 5 or more minuteshad passed, I knew it was really over this time.A few minutes later, my dad returned. When he came into the room, I toldhim I thought Mom had died. We both held her hands for a long time to seetogether if it really was over. Then I quietly stepped out of the room to give myfather some time alone with my mom, and to call my sister. Later we waited,4together with a dear friend who happened to stop by, for the funeral people tocome and take my mother's body.My grandmother's death had been entirely unexpected even though shewas 92 years old. She was in excellent shape for her age, although she had beenfretting for weeks about my mother's health. Yet always before, my mother hadmanaged to get better, even after having breast and lung cancer twice. No doubtmy grandmother was hoping and praying for yet another miracle from and for hergrown daughter. We all were.Thirteen days before my mother died, we went to tell my grandmother thatmy mother wasn't likely to survive this bout with cancer. My grandmother lookedstraight at me that morning and emphatically said, \"I do not want to be here towatch one of my girls die.\" We all told her how badly we felt about everything. Imade arrangements to pick her up the next day to take her to visit my mom forperhaps the last time. As we left my grandmother, we asked to have a socialworker look in on her periodically because she was really sad.Later that same day, the nursing home staff called. They said mygrandmother had somehow broken her hip and was beginning to slip in and out ofa coma that would likely kill her. No one had seen her fall, nor would she ever tellus if she had actually fallen. We were incredulous. When I reached her bedsideand asked her if she were somehow making herself sick because of Mom, shewould just smile slightly and remain quiet.5Later that evening my grandmother died. After a several hour period, herbreaths simply became more shallow and distanced in time. At the very end shetook one last little breath, and then nothing else. She and I were the only 2 peoplein her room. A nurse's aide came into the room a little while later to check on us.When I asked her if my grandmother were dead, she nodded.The nurse's aide then asked me if she could spend some time alone withmy grandmother. I did not know what she intended to do, but I knew I needed tomake some calls to my family, so I stepped outside the room. When I walkedback in, my silver-haired precious grandmother lay there with her eyes shut in anew nightgown and robe. Her hands were folded across her stomach. She lay ontop of fresh bed linens.My grandmother looked absolutely beautiful, just like a 92-year-oldSleeping Beauty. Her body was full of grace and poise. I will always feel indebtedto that nurse's aide. She had fully bathed, redressed, and changed the bed sheetsof a person who was already dead. Maybe that was nursing home protocol. Tome, it was an act of amazing grace from a guardian angel.As we waited together for the funeral home personnel to arrive, the aidestayed with me as I brushed my grandmother's hair and told stories about thiswonderful woman. When the funeral directors arrived, I helped them put mygrandmother into a body bag, something I could not later bring myself to do withmy mother.6We then walked quietly and slowly down the long nursing home corridor.There were 4 of us\u2014myself, 2 people from the funeral home, and mygrandmother in a body bag on a gurney. As we walked down the corridor, I sawseveral residents standing quietly at their doors, almost as if to pay their lastrespects. I thought to myself how hard it must be, when you are elderly, to see oneof your fellow nursing home residents being taken out in a body bag. I was sad forthem and sad for us.To this day there are many unanswered questions that remain in my mindabout death, despite having watched 2 very significant people in my life die. Iwonder how people truly make sense of their own losses. I wonder how thosewho have lost entire families in an instant due to accidents manage to cope andcarry on. I continue to think about the devastating and massive losses from theSeptember 11th tragedy.Amidst all of the uncertainties of life and death alike, what I do know isthat my grandmother's death helped prepare me for my mother's death 12 dayslater. It was also a stark personal revelation to me that losing a child, even a childthe age of my mother, is just not the way it is supposed to be.As I sat at the funerals for my grandmother and then my mother, I beganmy own personal journey into thinking and wondering extensively about death.The thought struck me about the unconditional love of a mother for her children(or a father for his), and the dire need to avoid the pain of losing a child. I began7to think how we as a family might feel even more consumed with grief, if thatwas possible, had the caskets been smaller and contained the remains of theyounger members of our family. The thoughts and questions stayed with me longafter the funerals ended. Thus began this dissertation journey.At times while creating this document I have dreamt about the babies orchildren or young people who were dying\u2014especially those whom I've had theprivilege of interviewing along with their family members and healthcareprofessionals. I have thought about them not in terms of what they haveaccomplished, but of what they may have missed or perhaps are going to miss. Ihave asked myself repeatedly: What is it like for a mother to push her baby out ofher body, and then have to bury that baby before he or she reaches adulthood? Apart of me believes all the research in the world will never fully answer thatquestion.I think about children and young people who may never put their firstteeth under their pillows, reach their first birthdays, go swimming, pack a satchelfor the first day of school, draw giant cursive letters on Big Chief tablets, performat their first recitals, drive a car, get nervous about their first dates, experiencetheir first kisses, go to the prom, or cross the stage of their graduations. I thinkabout young people who, at some level of their emotional being, know they willeventually be leaving their loved ones behind, sooner rather than later.8What takes place when our worst nightmares are realized and the dyingare children? What should be said to them? How do they make sense of theirlives? What can they teach others?Much is written in the literature about death and dying from a general,academic perspective. Yet much less is offered from the specific perspectives ofthose who have the greatest story to tell: the children and young peoplethemselves who are personally facing life-threatening illnesses. The hope of thisresearch is to expand upon the literature in this area. We begin with a briefoverview of current scholarship.The ChallengeTalking about death in general seems to be hard. Talking about death withpersons who are actually dying is even harder in that it represents one of thebiggest communicative challenges we all face.Miller and Knapp (1986) point to one of life's most difficult discursivesituations as the need for communicating with a person who is known to be dying.This particular sphere of communication represents a skill many do not want tothink about, although most would like to have instant expertise when faced withsuch an encounter. It often elicits an increase in avoidance strategies along thelines of being upbeat, updating, and recounting (Miller & Knapp, 1986).9The UnthinkableIf we find such difficulty in dealing with dying individuals who are grown,then what happens when children are the focus? Thus far a majority of extantscholarship is predicated upon a chronological order of reality in which adultsusually die first.Yet expected life scenarios do turn to the unexpected, in which the naturaland expected chronological order of death turns upside down. What happenswhen the very people who are dying are children and young people? Are we dyingto know this information? Extant research suggests not.Milo (1997) argues losing a child is out of the normal order of things tothe point of being unthinkable. My grandmother wanted no part of theunthinkable, for there is no doubt in my mind that she willed herself to die inorder to avoid the pain of losing a child\u2014even a child who was 72 years old.As a society, we contemplate the deaths of parents, grandparents, siblings,and friends as generally accepted and natural\u2014if sad\u2014facts of life (Fletcher,2002). In contemplating death, dying, or bereavement, however, few of us arewilling to consider children dying before their parents, given the death of a childis unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and outside the natural order of generationalprogression (Fletcher, 2002). Judd (1989) calls such a death out of season.10Un-Silencing Children's VoicesChildren's voices are noticeably silent in extant research on pediatricillness, pain, and death. In a extensive, though non-exhaustive, review of morethan 200 articles and books published since the 1960s, I found 12 studiescontaining sample populations comprising sick children (Bluebond-Langner,1978; Burton, 1975; Hunt, 1990; Goldman children's conceptualizations of adults'death. This reaffirms Thompson's (1989) notion that researchers place greaterweight on studying the challenges and ramifications of helping children adjust tothe deaths of others as opposed to their own, given the degree to whichresearchers themselves are uncomfortable even thinking about the subject ofchildren dying.Bricher (1999) suggests children's voices are distinctly missing inresearch surrounding children and pain. Goodman and McGrath (1991) found thata comprehensive analysis of pain problems often associated with terminalillnesses in childhood and adolescence continues to be void of the perspectives ofthe children themselves, although chronic pain is conservatively estimated toaffect 15 to 20 percent of the pediatric population.11In thinking about death and dying, I am making the argument that ifresearchers struggle with willingness to listen to children who are in chronic painthen the challenges in listening to children who may be dying are even greater.Even in scholarly writings on death and bereavement pushing for fullcommunication with individuals who are terminally ill, specific references todying children are noticeably absent.For instance, in an otherwise excellent compilation of articles on end-of-life issues from interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional perspectives, de Vries(1999) offers a wide range of viewpoints in an effort to address the complexity oflife and death, and to promote dialogue among those whose personal andprofessional interests bring them into contact with the dying and the bereaved.The compilation includes articles from the perspectives of grandparents in timesof bereavement and even the perspective of animals as neglected members offamilies coping with death. Yet no specific mention is made of the perspectives ofdying children.Why is this so? Fowler-Kerry (1990) argues that if we are to develop atrue understanding of pediatric healthcare issues, we must do so by hearingdirectly from children, as compared to hearing about them from parents,representatives, or advocates.12KnowingWe need to hear from seriously ill children because they know a great dealabout what is happening to them when they become ill. Nagy's (1948) pioneeringempirical work set the foundation for understanding more about how childrenthought about death in stages based on specific ages. Bluebond-Langner (1977)found in her seminal work with children who had leukemia that children becamestronger in their personal awareness of their own deaths as those deaths becameimminent, despite physical and cognitive limitations of disease progressions thatmight normally dictate otherwise.Silverman (2000) found there comes a time when children realize theywill die from their conditions. When this happens, parents need to be able tofollow their children's emotional and cognitive development in an effort torecognize the changes their children will experience in death conceptualizations,as well as their own ways of relating to the world.Extant literature suggests children from the ages of 6 to 10 years generatea sense their personal illnesses are no ordinary illnesses, despite frequent effortsof parents and medical personnel to keep the children unaware of their prognoses(Spinetta & Deasy-Spinetta, 1979). Faulkner (1993) argues children's perceivednuances of death, including their own, stem from personal experiences andenvironments that vary greatly from those of adults. Koocher (1974) found thatchildren are far from being miniature adults in terms of the quality of their13cognitive capabilities; thereby suggesting adult literature on death and dyingpresents an incomplete and thus inaccurate picture of children's perspectives indealing with their own illnesses.There is both a uniqueness and commonality in death experiences.Children who are seriously ill and their parents share many common experiencesand feelings (Spinetta & Deasy-Spinetta, 1979). As well, there are significantdifferences among experiences, personalities, economic and social standing, andpolitical and religious orientations. Such expected richness in similar anddifferent perspectives alike is worthy of in-depth examination through the voicesof the children themselves.A Limited GoalThe intent of this research is to delve into an important and expansive areaof study using a limited and narrow lens. The research is deliberately designed notto change any outcomes or make sweeping predictions. It is not designed to endwith a new communication theory or model or suggest how someone should orshould not die. In sum, it is not designed to culminate into one grand narrative.Rather, the study is predicated upon individual stories, each containing itsown messages. These messages collectively reflect an observer's look at howlanguage plays a role in the lives of children and young people with diseasesconsidered incurable and in the lives of those around them.14In essence, given their unique messages, the narratives themselves serve asstand-alone data. Such individualized offerings of self-disclosure give greatervoice to a special segment of society missing from extant literature, whileshedding new light on a difficult topic. In sum, this dissertation offers the storiesthemselves as a beginning framework upon which additional theoretical questionscan and should be pursued.The ProcessIn keeping with the limited intent of having the stories speak forthemselves, this study began with the following research questions:RQ1:What can scholars and society alike learn from hearingthe personal stories and narratives of dying children orchildren facing life-threatening or advanced illnesses?RQ2:What meaning and sense-making are these individualsconstructing during this time in their lives, and towardwhat ends?Additional research questions stemming from the data collection are identified inchapter 4, in the section titled \"Future Considerations.\"BricolageDenzin and Lincoln (1994, p. 2) describe qualitative research as multi-method in focus, involving an \"interpretive, naturalistic approach to its subjectmatter, suggesting that qualitative researchers study things in their natural15settings, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of themeanings people bring to them.\" A picture of qualitative research and its multiplemethodologies is painted as bricolage, from the French word for bricoler,meaning to putter about or to construct something by using whatever comes tohand. Levi-Strauss (1966, p. 17) calls this multi-faceted form of qualitativeresearch a commingled, close-knit set of practices providing solutions to aproblem in a concrete situation as offered by the bricoleur, a \"Jack of all trades ora kind of professional do-it-yourself person.\"The notion of bricolage is offered given the reliance upon qualitativeresearch as an important methodological foundation for this study. Pauly (1991)argues that the topic of all qualitative research is the making of meaning.Qualitative inquiry lends itself to a research plan that is like the methodologyitself: It does not reduce the process to some simple set of procedures in supportof a conceptualization. Lindlof (1995) says qualitative researchers are seeking topreserve the form and content of human behavior while analyzing its qualities,rather than subjecting it to mathematical or other formal transformations.Wright and Flemons (2002) argue researchers who wish to predict andcontrol, measure variables, test hypotheses, and make refutable truth claims willfind little of interest in most qualitative methods; but social scientists who aresearching for meaning rather than laws can find much in qualitative research toinspire and intrigue them. In sum, my attempt is not to find the ultimate truths16from the children and young people's stories, but rather to (1) let the stories speakfor themselves, and (2) examine similarities and uniqueness contained in thestories from which we can all gain knowledge about an inevitable humansituation: death.The PreparationPrior to undertaking this study, I conducted research in other areasinvolving healthcare or end-of-life communication using qualitative interviews.Included in this research were interviews with clergy persons from multi-denominational churches who minister to dying individuals and interviews withspouses whose partners died following many years of marriage. I have alsostudied healthy children and their experiences with dental pain and immunizationsfrom a communicative perspective. In most of these cases, I used a narrativeapproach involving open-ended questions. I use a similar approach in thisparticular study, as I discuss in greater detail in subsequent subsections of thischapter.My additional exploratory research and preparation included becomingcertified as a hospice volunteer in a large municipal hospice organization cateringto both adults and children. As a part of this certification process and the studiesmentioned above, I conducted preliminary interviews with hospice clinicians,clergy, and other volunteers, as well as with healthcare professionals andvolunteers in various hospital, pediatric palliative care, and nursing home settings.17As a part of my own civic interests and academic scholarship, I alsoparticipated in a 3-day camp for children who had experienced the deaths of lovedones. I conducted no interviews during this time; nor did I attempt in any way touse the event as a data-gathering opportunity. No written data, transcriptions, ornotes were taken during the retreat, although I did hold informal conversationwith various hospice professionals trained in pediatric research and with othercommunity volunteers.Before I participated in the children's bereavement camp, I also attendedan orientation session that focused on the stages of grief for children from theperspective of chronological age. Results of the orientation session validatedmuch of the bereavement literature in suggesting that age matters in children'sconceptualizations and understandings of death, including their own. At thisorientation session, the hospice professionals also highlighted the importance ofunderstanding community support systems in examining this topic from familialperspectives.Data CollectionJudd (1989) asserts that although theories help form a useful structure,actually working with a child brings forth the excitement of discovery. In mywork with children and young people, their parents, and healthcare providers, Iused participant interviews as the basic data collection methodology for the study.18Rubin and Rubin (1995) claim that interviews work best if the interviewerand his or her conversational partner are in a small room\u2014maybe sippingcoffee\u2014while quietly discussing an event or exploring some aspect of theirculture. For this study, repeated attempts were made to replicate such settings inquiet and conversational interview fashion with the children and their parents andwith healthcare professionals. Such attempts met with varying degrees of success,especially when the interviews were conducted in hospital rooms during theadministration of medical treatments.Geertz (1973) affirms there is much to learn about cultural interpretationsfrom what he calls thick descriptions in the interviewing process in terms ofinscribing meanings around particular social actions. For purposes of this study,data analysis was conducted based on thick descriptions resulting fromconversations with children who have serious or terminal illnesses from advanceddiseases, and from conversations with their parents. An assumption was madefrom the onset that if children and their parents were voluntarily giving of theirtime for interviews, they were willing to tell their stories and experiences indetail.RecruitmentThirty interviews were conducted for the purposes of this study. Thirteeninterviews were conducted with seriously ill children and young people primarilyidentified by physicians who practice in areas involving advanced or terminal19illnesses. The remaining interviews were conducted with parents and healthcareprofessionals working in the field of pediatric care, including pediatric palliativecare in which children are simply being kept comfortable in preparation for theirexpected deaths.The sample size recommended for this study was in keeping with otherscholarly work in this general area based on qualitative methodologies. Yedidiaand McGregor (2001) conducted a study based on semi-structured interviews with30 patients as close to their times of death as they determined possible.Brinchmann, Forde, and Nortvedt (2002) conducted 20 in-depth interviews withparents making life-and-death decisions regarding premature and/or critically illinfants. Fletcher (2002) used a sample of 2 families as a way in which totheoretically compare events, incidents, or happenings to determine variances infamilies grieving the losses of their children.Age matters in children and young people's death conceptualizations. Assuch, careful consideration was given to the requested age of the children andyoung people in the sample population. For purposes of this study, children andyoung people in the data set fell within the range of 5 to 20 years of age. Spinettaand Deasy-Spinetta (1979) found children in this age range, or more narrowly inthe range of 6 to 18, have a fuller sense of the magnitude of their own illnesses.Another justification for selecting this particular age range for the sample20population related to the children's abilities to verbally express their feelings,beliefs, and experiences.One of the important distinctions of this research was a sincere attempt toconduct stand-alone interviews with as many children and young people aspossible, specifically without the presence of parents or family members. Such aprotocol was attempted, with varying degrees of success in this study.Appendix A contains a listing of all of the agencies and key individuals Ipersonally contacted for the purpose of finding individuals to interview. I made anadditional but unsuccessful attempt to secure respondents via advertising inpublications such as newsletters for the Texas Nurse Practitioners and theNational Association of Social Workers (Texas Chapter). Appendix B representsnewsletter copy placed in both publications at my expense. No respondents weredirectly recruited via this method.Finding willing respondents took approximately 3 months of intensivework, not including the time invested in preparing a second research application.That step in the recruitment process is described in the following section.Institutional Review Board (IRB) ApprovalsTwo Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals were obtained for thisstudy. The original proposal, IRB Protocol Number 2002-11-0038, went throughThe University of Texas at Austin. The UT-Austin Office of Research Supportand Compliance approved the study request on December 18, 2002, prior to the21proposal defense for a time period lasting until November 25, 2003. The studywas re-approved from September 3, 2003, to September 3, 2004.When I was making initial contacts for data collection purposes, numerousindividuals referred me to Dr. Javier R. Kane, M.D., Associate Professor andHead of the Palliative Care Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas Health ScienceCenter at San Antonio. Dr. Kane works with children who have advanced illnessand/or children who are in the active stages of dying. In July of 2003, I met withDr. Kane and toured his clinic, which is located on the 8th floor of the ChristusSanta Rosa hospital facility in San Antonio, Texas.Dr. Kane and his pediatric palliative care team were extremely excitedabout the prospects of working on a qualitative study involving communicationaspects of ill children and young people with advanced illness. Dr. Kanesuggested that I undergo a second IRB approval process so that he and hisassociates could serve as a referral source.The second IRB was approved through The University of Texas HealthCenter in San Antonio, IRB Protocol Number 034-0099-105. It was approved onNovember 5, 2003, with an expiration date of November 4, 2004.Dr. Martha Morse, M.D., Pediatric Pulmonary Specialist from SanAntonio, Texas, was also instrumental in referring patients to me. Dr. Morse wasfeatured in a San Antonio-Express News article titled \"Doctor says it's all right to22be human: Physician Martha Morse shares her experiences on dealing with dyingpatients (Pisano, 2003).\"I formed partnerships with Drs. Kane and Morse and other individualslisted in Appendix A to find willing interview respondents. Respondents werealso identified via a convenience sample in collaboration with physicians andrepresentatives of healthcare provider organizations such as hospice entities andchildren's hospitals.Once the parents of prospective respondents were identified, I requestedthat staff members of the healthcare facilities or professional agencies make theinitial contact via a cover letter with information on how to contact me ifindividuals were interested in participating. This process was in keeping with theIRB specifications. Appendix C shows a general letter given to individualsworking in the field who were willing to share information about the study withpotential respondents. Once individuals indicated a willingness to consider beinginterviewed, or to having their children interviewed, names were passed along tome by healthcare physicians or individuals working in the field for follow-uppurposes. I made no direct contact with potential respondents until permission hadbeen granted by participating physicians or healthcare providers.Given the complexity of working with individuals during this particulartime in their lives, I developed an interview decision tree prior to data collection.Appendix D shows a general model of the decision tree.23Appendix E shows a typical Interview Protocol, including the generaloutline used as a starting point. I made modifications as warranted. The primaryinterview criteria beyond medical diagnoses were that (1) the children or youngpeople be able to communicate, and (2) that in the case of children 18 or younger,their parents be agreeable to the interviews.Both male and female children were recruited. Serious attempts weremade in working with various healthcare professionals to find gender and ethnicdiversity within the respondent pool.InterviewsI solicited interviews with pediatric, parental, and medical personnel.Regarding parental involvement, repeated attempts were made to separateparental participation between mothers and father to the extent possible so as tomaximize gender participation.Interviews ranged in length from approximately 20 minutes to well over 2hours. Locations for the interviews varied, predominantly between therespondents' homes and the Christus Santa Rosa Pediatric Palliative Care Center,in both the clinic and hospital settings. Other interview locations included retailoutlets such as restaurants and coffee shops. I used semi-structured, open-endedquestions in the interviews in support of the identified Research Questions. Suchquestions are shown in Appendix E as asked of both children and parents.24Appendix F is an overview of the respondent profile includingchildren/young people, their parents, and healthcare providers. As noted, somechildren and young people were in remission from their diseases. Some were inthe active stages of dying. One of the identified respondents was too ill to beinterviewed at length beyond an initial brief conversation. He subsequently died afew weeks later. However, his mother was willing to be interviewed to give voiceto her dying son.Some of the children and young people were struggling with advancedillnesses in various stages, e.g. cancer or Cystic Fibrosis, from which full recoveryor life longevity was not expected. In sum, the overall criteria for being includedin the project required first, that the children/young people and parents werewilling to participate in a voluntary capacity, and second, that such participationon the part of the children and young people would in no way make difficultsituations worse. In keeping with IRB specifications, it was stipulated in advancethat if, at any time, a patient's ongoing participation in the project was thought byany involved party to be detrimental to the patient's situation, interviews wouldbe discontinued or not pursued. This situation did not, however, occur at any timein the data collection.I recorded all interviews via cassette tape, and made extensive field notesalong with the taped conversations. An outside professional service transcribed25the tapes. Confidentiality was maintained at all times in keeping with both IRBprotocols.Data AnalysisFor this study, I used a thematic approach to compile and analyze data byconducting an ongoing content analysis of the interview transcripts (Patton,1990). As Patton recommends, I conducted data analysis based on variousstrategic options, such as categorization via chronology, key events, varioussettings, people, processes, and issues. I developed and expanded emergingthemes as a result of the interviews using Glaser and Strauss's (1967) constant-comparison method to create categories of relationship between data units.ValidityBabbie (2001) states that simply \"being there\" is a powerful technique forgaining insights into the nature of human affairs in all their rich complexity. Heuses an example of an interview with a nurse discussing impediments to patients'abilities to cope with cancer in suggesting that observations andconceptualizations are valuable in their own right, and provide the basis forfurther research\u2014both qualitative and quantitative.Kirk and Miller (1986) propose that one way to help ensure validity withresearch is to constantly evaluate the data by spending considerable time in thefield and with resource persons in order to check and recheck for accuracy.26Throughout the study, I periodically made checks and rechecks with variousrespondents in the field regarding the data being received.ReliabilityBabbie (2001) addresses the reliability issue by suggesting that researchersshould use the benefit of colleagues in a communal sense of science to sort outtheir own biases and points of view. Bochner and Ellis (1996) argue thatqualitative researchers are hard-pressed to stand above and outside what they arestudying. To help ensure reliability, I periodically used physicians and otherhealthcare providers and professionals from hospice and other healthcare entitiesas communal colleagues for the purposes of checking both data reliability andvalidity. I discussed emerging themes with these various resource individuals on aperiodic basis while maintaining confidentiality of participants in the samplepopulation at all times.In studying terminally ill persons, Wright and Flemons (2002) call for theestablishment of relational integrity in which relationships being studied are heldto be inviolable. Researchers must not impose themselves on the person or thingbeing researched, but must allow the researchers' informants, experiences, data,and analyses to speak for themselves.Two components of Wright and Flemons' (2002, p. 268) choices forensuring relational integrity include (1) treating interviews as conversations inwhich respondents are invited but not pulled or pushed into an exploration of27experiences; and (2) allowing data analysis to become a process of composingstories about participants' stories in the way of creating \"meta-stories that retainthe uniqueness of individual participants' voices and that weave these voicescontrapuntally.\" The importance of storytelling as a core methodology for thisstudy is discussed in the following section.Narratives and storiesThe core foundation upon which this dissertation is based points to thevalue of stories. Everyone has a story to tell. At the beginning of this chapter, Itold part of my own story, involving my mother and grandmother. Browning(1992) says that stories are communications about personal experiences told ineveryday discourse that do not require a technical specialist to understand whatthey mean. He argues the telling of stories gives coherence to a group subculture(Browning, 1992). Fine and Sandstrom (1988) state that working with childrenpresents opportunities for researchers to step back and learn from those who areconstructing their own worlds in the moments of creating monuments.Gilbert (2002) says the terms narrative and story are generally found to besynonymous in a world in which we live in stories, not statistics. I use the termsas such for the purposes of this section and within this study.The telling of personal narratives is one form of presenting self to othersthat begins early in life and crosses racial, ethnic, and cultural boundaries(Markham Shaw, 1997). Not only do we present ourselves through narrative,28those with whom we are involved present us to others through narrative. Bruner(1990) and others offer narratives as a way in which individuals make sense ofexperience. The story metaphor emphasizes that we create order and constructtexts in particular contexts. Because narratives help create plots from disorderedexperience, they become essential meaning-making structures that must bepreserved and not fractured by investigators, who must respect respondents' waysof constructing meaning (Riessman, 1993). Situational contexts such as difficultlife transitions and personal trauma lend themselves to order making (Beck, 2001;Riessman, 1993). Beck (2001) argues the public presentation of personalnarratives can accomplish coherence and consistency through the description ofsome personal trauma. Storytelling is simply what we do with our researchmaterials, and what informants do with us (Riessman, 1993). Browning (1992)points to stories as messages that unfold naturally; and that stories are known tobe flexible, evolving, and changing. People learn to give context to what is said ina story (Browning, 1992).For purposes of this research, knowing more about ill or dying children inparticular can and should teach us a lot about understanding the future generationsof children who face life-threatening illnesses and their parents who live throughthose situations vicariously and experientially. Such information should also be ofassistance from a public policy perspective as societal policy leaders continue tostruggle with the issue of dying children from a myriad of contexts. At a29minimum, hearing from ill children and young people should arguably help shedadditional light on what Sprang and McNeil (1995) define as one of the mostavoided topics of conversation in society: our own deaths.Puchalski (2002) argues that of all life's difficult yet importantexperiences, dying may be the most difficult; thus a critical need exists to ensurethat society enhances the dignity of all people, especially those made vulnerableby illness and suffering. Puchalski identifies listening as one of the primary waysof ensuring this dignity.When I have told people about the topic of my dissertation, the response,quite often, has been the same: a non-verbal contorting of the face in grimace likefashion. A verbal response usually followed along the lines of \"Why in the worldwould you want to study that? It's so depressing.\"Yet listening to my own inner compass following the deaths of my motherand grandmother told me to make this journey, which has been far fromdepressing, although there have been many sad days. Through it, I have becomeconvinced there is much to learn about living and dying from talking with thosewhose lives may be coming to a close, most especially the children and youngpeople who are experiencing the unthinkable.30CHAPTER 2:THE STORIESStories are important within research. Gilbert (2002, p. 235) suggests thatstorytelling is integral to study in that it affords the opportunity to hearrespondents speak in their owns words, as filtered through choices made by theresearcher. The approach \"taps into the emotional as well as the intellectualexperience of the participants.\"The stories contained in this study come from the hearts and minds ofthose seriously ill. They contain as much raw transcription as possible in an effortto maximize the accuracy of the respondents' emotional experiences. I presentthem here in chronological order of my interviews, beginning with Minister Mike.A. Minister Mike ForetellsMy first interview resulted from a referral by a pediatric pulmonaryspecialist who had heard of my research. She sent me the name of the young man,Mike, who was affectionately known as \"Minister Mike.\"1 The young man and 1 Unless otherwise noted, the names I use in this dissertation are the actualnames of the people involved, used with their permission. In keeping with IRBrequirements and healthcare rules and regulations, I have changed the names ofsome people in some narratives. In this story, I have changed the names of thepeople I call \"Mike/Minister Mike,\" \"Little Sam,\" \"Dr. Esperanza,\" and \"Rosie.\"31his mother were anxious to tell me of their lives in the spirit of witnessing. Theirstory began with a tale of a vision.In the Beginning: A Brotherly VisionMinister Mike foretells a vision: \"My brothers and sisters in Christ, I bringyou good news of great joy. For I have seen a great light. And the great light isthat of my brother, Little Sam.\"A young, seriously ill, 12-year-old boy, Mike remembers the vision. Whilesitting in his wheelchair in a small, contained, and humble apartment he shareswith his mother, the handsome young man with puppy-dog eyes and a full head ofstraight black hair tells me what transpired during one of many hospital visits.In his vision, Mike clearly saw his older brother, who had beenaffectionately known as Little Sam. Little Sam died at the age of 4, of the samedisease that afflicts Mike now. No one had ever talked very much about LittleSam with his younger brother because they shared the same disease. Everyonetried to protect Mike.Yet on this particular hospital visit, Little Sam visited Mike in the hospitalin the vision. \"He came. I saw him in a vision with 2 other angels. I didn't knowwho they were. I couldn't really visualize them. But he had come and he told me:'Get Mom out of there\u2014it's a trap.'\" So Mike insisted that he and his motherleave the small South Texas town that had been their home in order to receivebetter medical care and escape worrisome family problems. The vision32transported the family to a large metropolitan area of Texas where they willinglyagreed to tell me their story.Mike and Minister MikeMike spends his days sitting in a wheelchair, riding a special transport vanthat picks him up in the wee hours of the morning, going to school, playing videogames, watching television, talking to friends who call him \"Dude,\" and visitingwith his mother and grandmother. To pass the time while glorifying his God, hesings Christian songs in a rich deep voice with a full vibrato in sweet harmonywith his mother. His nights are spent sleeping on a small bed tethered to oxygen.His birth name is Mike. His self-appointed name is Minister Mike. Hismother uses that name as well for her son. He foretells his own life story, as shortor long as it may be.Children with Special NeedsMike moves around predominantly by using a wheelchair. He has beenstricken with Neuro-Muscular-Dystrophy (NMD), or more specifically, SpinalMuscular Atrophy (SMA). Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic mutation thatdestroys nerve cells in the spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy(wasting).2 For Mike, the disease has specifically robbed him of his ability to 2 MDA Diseases (2001, May 18). Spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy MDAfact sheet. Retrieved January 4, 2004, fromhttp:www.mdausa.org/disease/fasheet_sbma.html.33walk, and so he remains confined to a wheelchair, relies heavily on oxygen, and issurrounded by machines to help him maneuver through the day. Amidst the manycelebrity posters and computer games, Mike's bedroom looks like a mini-hospitalroom.The disease is no stranger to Mike or his mother. Four years after LittleSam died, Mike was born with the same affliction. Mike's mother calls her boys\"children with special needs.\"Twelve years ago physicians told Mike's mother he would not live to hisfirst birthday because of his physical plight. Today he defiantly contorts his bodyand thrusts a clenched fist in the air from his wheelchair to proclaim his longevityat age 12. \"Against all odds\" seems a fitting mantra for Mike, especially ascompared to the very short life of his older brother.Little Sam and the FamilyDespite dying so young, Little Sam seems to have paved much of the wayfor his younger brother, Mike. Little Sam was treated in a small community wheremedical technology and innovation at the time were quite limited. \"[There] theydidn't have the technology like we have now, like the IPV machine, the VPAPmachine, they didn't have all that,\" Mike explained. The Intra-PulmonaryPercussive Ventilation (IPV\u00ae) machine helps clear individuals' lungs andimprove overall breathing. The Variable Positive Airway Pressure (VPAP\u00ae)machine is designed to help with breathing overall and specifically assist in34alarming patients and caregivers when respiratory pressure is too high, too low, orthere is a power failure involving any of the breathing assistance machines.Mike's vision of Little Sam gave him the impetus to insist that a move bemade. In about 1995, they say, Mike and his mother made the move across Texasand settled near a large hospital serving pediatric residents where physicians werelearning more and more about his disease.The move from a small community to a metropolitan area also helpedMike solve family issues, primarily for his mom. \"I just kept telling Mom that wehave to move away, and that it's [the smaller town] a trap, and we need to get outof there.\" Mike says his dad wasn't the \"right kind of person\" for the family.\"Although this is where most of my family lives [in the smaller town], I just kepttelling Mom that we have to go to the bigger place. It's a trap, and we need to getout of there,\" Mike kept saying, over and over again.After the move, when Mike's father sent his mom divorce papers sayingtheir marriage was nothing more than \"a big show,\" Mike responded byencouraging his mom and viewing the dilemma as a mother/son partnershipproblem, saying that \"We had to go through that part, and we got through it.\"Mike continues to be estranged from his father. \"Up until now, ever since we leftthe house to come down here [to the larger city], I haven't seen him ever since. Idon't want no contact. I don't want to, I don't. . . . I don't really want contact withhim because I don't want him to give my mom trouble.\"35Golly Dude: Minister Mike and His LegacyMike and his mom reminded me of an important Biblical teaching to them(John 3:16, New Revised Standard Version): \"For God so loved the world Hegave his only son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but willhave eternal life.\" Young Mike and his mom believe in that messagewholeheartedly. It embodies the very heart and soul of the way they live theirlives, and carry out their mission of service to others.Mike explained his belief to me that God had given him a highlyprivileged and very special agency with Him, proclaiming him \"Minister Mike.\"Mike laughs when he talks about his friends who say: \"Golly, dude; you've got aspecial relationship with God. real relationship with God.\" Heresponds by saying: \"Yeah, even though I may look like I'm playing my[computer or video] games or I'm doing something else, I'm talking to Godactually. That's my time alone when I'm playing my games. I just talk to Him inthe mornings when I'm just there.\" When asked if God talks back to Mike, heresponded without looking up and without elaboration, \"Yeah.\"Carrying on a conversation with Mike means sometimes you are talkingwith 12-year-old, all-boy Mike, whose favorite movie is Finding Nemo, and whoblushes when he talks about meeting a beauty contestant winner from his largecity. At other times, talking with this child with special needs means you arereceiving The Word from Minister Mike. He is quick to quote Bible verses. He is36a soloist in his church choir, and he actively solicits food and toy donations for theunderserved, all as callings from God.Both Mike and his mom wholeheartedly feel that Mike has lived 11 yearslonger than expected for a variety of reasons, including the love and care ofoutstanding physicians and the benefit of research and technology surroundinghim in the bigger city. Yet the primary reason Mike believes he is still alive isbecause God has called him to minister to others. This special calling has allowed,and mandated, that Mike live in order to become Minister Mike, and be in serviceand outreach to others. God \"helps me out,\" Mike explained, thus giving backbecause of that help is important to him.Mike defines this outreach as his \"legacy,\" a word that many 12-year-oldboys could arguably not even know\u2014much less feel a burning desire to createbefore they die. Mike likes to tell his story over and over again so that he cansustain the legacy he is ardently trying to create as fast as he can, especially givenhis limited life expectancy.During the Christmas season, Minister Mike actively solicits funds inorder to dress up as Santa Claus. He hands out toys to younger children lessfortunate. When asked how his legacy building was proceeding, he replied: \"Oh,it's going good. I still haven't reached as many as I had over there [in his smallhometown]. We are still getting our feet wet here. We're still trying to get morepeople here [in his larger city].\"37People, Not AnimalsMike wants to make others understand how to relate to people likehimself. He wants people to understand there is a definite demarcation between\"people\" and \"animals.\"\"I like it when people treat people with disabilities as people\u2014like regularpeople. Because we are, we're not just animals, we're not anything like that.We're normal human beings. We are just like any normal person.\"Mike firmly believes that \"even though we do come in different shapesand sizes and colors and everything, we're just like everybody else. It's nodifferent.\" The bottom line is that \"we're still human beings.\"Mike and Dr. EsperanzaOne of Mike's favorite people is his physician, Dr. Esperanza. Mike lovesDr. Esperanza, and his face lights up with a smile when anyone mentions hername. Mike loves to talk about her, and tell stories of how they work together tokeep Mike from dying.Dr. Esperanza is well known in the large city for her work with youngpeople and children. After 16 years of medical practice as a pediatric pulmonaryspecialist, she says now that she can love a patient and lose a patient and surviveand \"be better for it.\"38Together Dr. Esperanza and Mike fix his lungs\u2014over and over and overagain for the time being. Like so many young people with spinal muscularatrophy, Mike repeatedly finds himself knocking at death's door because of lungfluid problems. Dr. Esperanza has repeatedly saved him. They work together as ateam, and they \"shoot straight\" with each other about the severity of eachsituation.\"We openly speak of him dying sooner rather than later, although unlikecancer there is no timetable,\" Dr. Esperanza said. \"As long as he doesn't get aninfection, he can go on a while, but when he gets a cold, he just goes downhill,\"she added.During one particularly difficult time within this past year, Dr. Esperanzarepeatedly tried to eliminate fluid from Mike's lungs so that he could breathe, butwithout complete success. Mike described the procedure: \"They have a specialtube . . . and this procedure takes about 20 or 30 minutes. They have this tube, andthey go in and it has a real small camera, and they see inside the lung. There's ahole for suctioning, and there's a hole for putting medications in there, and there'sa hole to blow in oxygen.\"Mike calls the procedures \"bronchs.\" During this particularly difficulttime, Dr. Esperanza had already completed at least 4 or 5 bronchs on Mike, eachof which could be life threatening because of the medical risks associated withsedation and other potential complications. While Dr. Esperanza had been39successful in getting out much of the phlegm and mucus and other problem fluidsin Mike's lungs, too much fluid still remained, which would eventually kill him.\"She [Dr. Esperanza] told my mom to prepare for the worst, and to startthinking reality,\" Mike said. Prior to the 5th or 6th procedure, Mike had told hismom that he wasn't ready to leave yet, although he knew that Dr. Esperanza hadtried everything humanly possible to clean out his lungs. He even told Dr.Esperanza before the procedure took place not to feel badly if it didn't work thistime around because she had tried everything possible.He also specifically called Dr. Esperanza over to his hospital gurney priorto the procedure to say \"thank you\" to her for all of her efforts. \"I want to thankyou, and I know you have done and you are doing everything in your power thatyou can, and I want to tell you that I love you,\" Mike told Dr. Esperanza. \"I sawmy mom turn around and she started to cry. Dr. Esperanza put her head down, andshe turned red, I saw her,\" Mike remembered. He specifically requested that Dr.Esperanza watch over his mother because he knew that she would be sad when hedied.\"And finally it came to her [Dr. Esperanza], and God gave her this idea,\"Mike said explaining the innovative procedure that Dr. Esperanza had createdspecifically for Mike as a last-ditch attempt to keep him alive. \"What she did [avariation of the standard procedure], took her a little bit longer, this one took 40 to50 minutes,\" Mike explained. \"But what she did with this procedure was [to first40go] in there, and she sucked out as much as she could. Then she massaged thelung to push all the stuff to the top, to the upper lung, so that it would be easier todrain. She had sucked it all, and got it all, and then she blew oxygen in there, sheopened it up and made it blow up so it would get full of air. Then she told me thatshe had blown some of her breath into me. She had blown some of her oxygeninto me.\"When the procedure ended Mike told Dr. Esperanza that her \"breath musthave been anointed because it sure got up in that lung. And she just smiled at me.I told her: 'Dr. Esperanza, God gave you the grace and the knowledge and thepower to get through this,'\" Minister Mike said.Avoiding the TubesLike so many other ill children and young people, Mike is keenly aware ofhis illness, and the ramifications of certain situations. One of his biggest worriesis the possibility of tubes being inserted into his body that would hinder his abilityto talk and eat on his own.In 2002, Mike experienced severe throat complications. He could notswallow. He encountered a new minor procedure to him called \"swallowingtherapy,\" in which lemon swabs were used in his mouth to help stimulate themuscles. Through this stimulation Mike was eventually able to increase his facialflexibility and open up his mouth more to increase his abilities to communicateand eat. Talking and eating are important to Mike. \"It was a little crazy because I41almost had to get a feeding tube, almost, it was close. . . . It was God again. Hehelped me out,\" Mike proclaimed.Shooting StraightMike believes talking about his illness is a way of helping others. Whenasked if Dr. Esperanza always \"shoots straight\" with him, he replied: \"Mmhmm.She's a really good doctor, and I have a really good relationship with her.\"Talking directly is important to both Mike and his mom. Mike's momaffectionately remembers the time when he told another doctor besides Dr.Esperanza, \"You know what? This is my body. You are going to do the things tomy body. . . . So you speak to me,\" Mike demanded. He was 11 or 12 years old atthe time.\"Sometimes I tell other people about it [the illness], and I think it sort ofhelps them to understand,\" Mike said. Even when asked about a possiblepreference at times for not talking about being sick, Mike responded: \"Oh, it'sOK, it's not really that bad.\" He especially prefers to hear directly from all hisdoctors, as opposed to some physicians' practice of asking the parents to first stepoutside the room for conversation, leaving the young patients alone to wonderwhat is being said about them. Mike despises this outside-the-room dialoguepractice that he again likens to inhumane treatment of the less-than-human: \"I tellpeople that I don't like people who treat us like animals,\" he stated.42A Mother's PerspectiveMike's mom, Rosie, knows the heartbreak of losing a son, having saidgoodbye to Little Sam when he was 4. She is now reliving a similar story withMike.Being honest and straightforward with Mike has always been important toRosie. Yet as a mother she first tried to protect her younger son from thinkingabout death. She did not talk with Mike about Little Sam because of the diseasethey shared. When Mike told her he already knew about Little Sam from hisvision in the hospital, communication lines between Rosie and her son werestrengthened even more.\"I thought he [Mike] wasn't ready to know of his first brother and that hehad passed on,\" Rosie commented. . . . \"Then him[Little Sam]. . . . It was at that time that he [Mike] knew and understood what wasgoing on. It was through that experience that he started being more open and alsotalking about if he himself were to pass on. We are very open about that [dying].\"Rosie also told another visionary and prophetic story in which Mikesomehow learned of the death of a fellow church member and Catholic sister longbefore the news was actually delivered to the family by a minister. As the storygoes, Mike was in the hospital, and had asked to be taken outside for some freshair, and to look at the buildings. While he and Rosie were sitting outside, they sawan eagle soaring. Rosie felt an overwhelming peace fill her heart and soul. \"I43know about coming under the shadows of the Almighty, and that His wings willcover us,\" she said.After seeing the eagle, both Mike and Rosie then saw a dove fly by and siton a window ledge. The dove began staring at the two of them. Rosie comments:\"And then Mike says to me: 'You know, Mom, this is no coincidence,'\" referringto seeing the eagle and the dove. \"'There is a message behind this.'\"Rosie continued: \"Then Mike . . . The sister passed away already.'\"Later that day when the church pastor called to check on Mike, Rosieasked about the sister. Actually, she commented to the pastor that she alreadyknew the sister had died. The pastor asked Rosie how she had already becomeaware of that situation. She answered: \"Mike told me.\"To this day, both Mike and Rosie believe that the sister sent the eagle andthe dove to appear to them in the hospital garden so that together they might prayfor her as she made her transition from life to death. They cherish that memory.Rosie believes she and Mike have a natural and a spiritual understandingthat will sustain them both, regardless of the future. She affirms that as Mikegrows older, he should become more of an advocate for his own needs.No longer will Rosie allow physicians to pull her aside to talk away fromMike about her son's grave medical situation. She stated: \"Mike, I don't need to44teach you no more. You are an advocate on your own.\" Slowly she is beginning torelease her son, just as she had to do with Little Sam.Despite relying fully on God, sometimes her faith waivers, given that bothof her children were born with spinal muscular atrophy, which will most likelytake them both away from her eventually. \"It's not to say in the natural I don'tfeel the angers or . . . say, 'Why those did come, andthose feelings did come,\" Rosie explained. \"However, I knew that I was not incontrol of our lives, and I knew that our lives were only passing through here. Iknew that I needed to trust and depend on the Lord,\" she added.Rosie lives for the moment. She fully accepts that only through God'sgrace will she be able to handle what is yet to come her way. For now, she wantsand needs to live each day in the moment, knowing that, as the saying goes,tomorrow will be another day.Be Still My Soul\"Staying still\" is the bottom line for Rosie. Despite a reality that couldhave easily buckled other parents, Rosie prepares for the future with herremaining and terminally ill son by staying still. \"Sometimes things are sochallenging. Life is so challenging and hard, and not knowing about the unknown.We need to know that if we are emotionally reacting to the situation, then we needto stay still, and The Answer will come. The peace comes to us right as we areleaving. In the meantime, each day is God's masterpiece.\"45The FutureLike so many sages who have lived much longer lives before him, Mikehas visions about his life as it stands today and his future. He still continues arelationship with Little Sam through his dreams. Little Sam would be 16 now ifhe were still alive. Perhaps the brothers are preparing for a reunion in a differentrealm.Mike continues to talk with his mom about his illness. Most of the time,however, they prefer to just go about \"enjoying their lives, enjoying Godtogether,\" Mike said. \"We usually do things together, like eat and we playgames,\" he added.Yet the notion of life and death is still fraught with high stakes andweariness for Mike and his mom. Sometimes talking or thinking about the futureis difficult for Mike. He changed the subject only once during the entireinterview. When I asked him a question about his future, he said \"Sounds like it'sgoing to rain or something.\"Nonetheless, perhaps talking about the future is something Mike choosesnot to do, as opposed to avoiding the topic entirely. Like the angel Gabriel in theChristmas story who foretells the coming of a special birth, Mike seemed to knowhow things were going to shake out in terms of his own life and death story. Atage 12, he appeared not to be unfolding his entire life story\u2014at least not at thistime during the interview.46He does, however, seem to gingerly suggest a premonition for his ownfuture: \"Well, there's some stuff coming in the future. Next year I don't know thewhole story. Only God knows what's in store for me next year. Yeah, there arethings coming in the future\u2014probably this month or next month. It will be quite afew weeks from now. I'm just praying about it,\" he confided.With that, Mike begins to sing Christian songs with full vibrato using hismuch-coveted lungs to praise his God. His mom joins in. Together they makebeautiful harmony. \"Against all odds.\" That is The Word proclaimed through thelife being led by 12-year-old Minister Mike.EpilogueFive months after this interview was held, Minister Mike's mother calledme to say that Mike was in the hospital and not doing well. The last time I sawhim, he was about half the size as before. The circumference of his arms and legswas about the size of a quarter. He could barely speak, much less sing. He smiledslightly and said hello when I walked into the room.While Mike rested, his mother walked me around the hospital wing. Sheshowed me the Tree of Life plaque commemorating those children who diedwithin the previous few years. Each child had a gold square with his or her nameengraved on it, signifying the branches of the tree. About one-half of the squareswere blank.47Rosie pointed to the gold square at the very top of the tree: \"That's the oneMike picked out for himself,\" she explained. Mike picked out the square when hehad arrived at the hospital a few days before.A few days after our visit, Mike was discharged from the hospital to die athome. Before he was released, Mike fulfilled his dream of giving his mom asurprise birthday party in his hospital room, and meeting a San Antonio Spursbasketball star. The basketball star said afterwards that this special 12-year-oldboy ministered more to him than anyone ever had, according to Mike's mom.Three weeks later on an early Saturday morning, Mike asked his mom tophysically lift him up in bed so that he could reach out to God and the angels. Hewas ready to go. He died a few minutes later, telling his mom that he loved herwith his last breath. The local newspaper ran a story about his death and hisministries.At his funeral, the 12-year-old boy/minister looked handsome anddistinguished lying in a gray casket clothed in a black tux, complete with cumber-bun and bowtie. People spoke of a reality in which this young man was simplyrunning a race ahead of his time. His beloved Dr. Esperanza gave one of the manyeulogies. She remembered a time when she had to lobby Mike hard to get him towear an oxygen mask at night so that his lungs could rest. Finally she told Mikethat if he wore the mask, he would be like an astronaut who could fly to the moonat night. The next time he saw her, he told her that her ploy had worked. He had48worn the mask and been to the moon - and that the moon was indeed made ofcheese.In true form, Mike had the last written and spoken word at his ownfuneral. The funeral program contained a message from him that read:Thank you for spending this special day with me for the laugherand memories this day will bring I thank my dear lord for theblessings like you and I hope that in time, you'll reminisce of thisday and say to yourself, \"Oh, what a glorious time.\"His aunt played a cassette tape toward the end of the service in which MinisterMike said goodbye to everyone in a clear, firm voice: \"Bye, everybody. I shallmiss you all.\"B. The Hooters GuyFor his 16th birthday in the fall of 2003, Richard3 wanted to go to a placecalled Hooters, a restaurant chain known specifically for its physically endowedand scantily clad waitresses, and that he did\u2014wheelchair and oxygen andall\u2014along with his mom and his beloved hospice friends who cared for him. Theentourage even included the hospice chaplain, \"Reverend Lois\" as Richard calledher. Reverend Lois proclaimed the outing as a \"monumental and joyful andwonderful celebration of life.\" 3 In this story, I have changed the names of the people I call \"Richard,\"\"Reverend Lois,\" \"Dr. Johnson,\" \"Bob,\" and \"Alonzo.\"49A short time later Richard's mom sent me a message via electronic mail.The message said: \"I just wanted to let you know that Richard went home to bewith his Lord, yesterday morning.\"Richard's StoryRichard embraced life with a smile that rippled off the sides of his faceand down his thin body in the wheelchair like water from an edgeless swimmingpool. He laughed at the humor, or attempted humor, of others around him almostas much as he laughed at himself.Life, for Richard, was ridiculously funny, embarrassing, joyful, ironic, andfull of love. Life was also quickly slipping away. He died less than eight weeksafter this interview was conducted, a little more than one month after his 16thbirthday celebration at Hooters.Despite the PrognosisRichard was born with Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), but did not officiallyreceive the diagnosis until he was 11 years old. A-T is a progressive, degenerativeillness that attacks many body systems. Children with this disease usually appearnormal at birth yet begin showing signs of the disease in the second year of life.50Initial signs may include slurred speech that stems from a lack of muscle controlcalled ataxia or \"wobbly balance.\"4In the disease progression, a second clinical hallmark occurs after theonset of ataxia in the form of telangiectasia, tiny red spider veins, usuallyappearing on the surface of the ears and cheeks or corners of the eyes exposed tosunlight. Approximately 70 percent of children experience a third major clinicalmoment in the form of recurrent respiratory infections which often become lifethreatening.Several times during his 16 years of life, Richard nearly died. Yet he keptbouncing back. He never failed to see the irony or humor of the situation.Richard's mom:[To Richard.] Do you want to tell her [myself as theinterviewer] what the doctor told you who put you inhospice?Richard:Yeah. I had 6 months.Question:Six months to live? How long ago was that?Richard:Six years ago. [A huge smile engulfs Richard's face.]And I'm still here.Richard led a full and active life during his few years. He loved to watch footballon television. He loved to bowl, and he says he was a darn good bowler wholoved to throw strikes. (Funny how we think children and young people withphysical challenges might be different in their thinking from all the rest of us). 4 A-T Children's Project (2004, n.d.). What is A-T? Retrieved January 4,51He loved to go to the Special Olympics, where he competed in the softballthrow. He was good at throwing the ball. He loved the movie Star Wars. Thesmall bathroom he shared with his brother and mom was covered with movieparaphernalia and posters of Luke Skywalker in action.Richard's body may have been physically challenged, but his ego washealthy. He was proud to have been featured in a newspaper article about his ownphysician and her work with dying children and young people.This particular cover story featured a beautiful color photograph of anexuberantly smiling Richard in a crisp black and white golf shirt. He was sittingin his wheelchair, having his breathing checked by his beloved physician, Dr.Johnson. Even though he exuded shyness and humility, he loved the attention.Richard would happily yet sheepishly grin when you showed him a copyof the newspaper article. He would then scribble an illegible autograph that atleast he said was his name on your copy. He would only return it to you if yougave him some dollars or at least some spare change\u2014a proverbial and loveablecon man. In this case the con man was a 16-year-old boy sitting contorted in hiswheelchair with a twinkle in his eye, a smile that would not quit, and a bottomlessheart of gold. 2004, from http://www.atcp.org/What%20is%20A-T.htm.52Oxygen HaterDespite his positive countenance and brilliant sense of humor, Richard didnot like being noticeably sick. He did not want people to know when he wasgetting oxygen. He fought the physical progression of his disease to the bitter end.His mom said Richard's reliance on a wheelchair came all of a sudden, asif he had willed his legs to hold him up for as long as he could. The same was truefor other medical necessities. \"He never had a feeding tube, a G [gastrointestinal]tube, and [all of a sudden] he had to have one of those. And we never had to havenursing care before, and now we're going to have to,\" his mom explained. InRichard's house, things seemed to be a certain way for the 16-year-old for 1minute, and then a completely different way the next.Richard detested being seen with oxygen although he knew it kept himalive. When he was forced to use oxygen, Richard often refused to go to school orchurch. Before he died, he often asked one of his hospice workers how manymore times she thought he would have to be on oxygen, because \"there are timeswhen he thinks that he will no longer bounce back from being on oxygen orantibiotics,\" his mom commented.Although the oxygen tubes going into his nose gave him the breathingassistance he desperately needed when necessary to stay alive, they made Richardfeel horribly embarrassed and self-conscious. Interestingly enough, Richard livedin modern western civilization where permanent body piercing and demarcation53over all parts of the face are arguably typical and prevalent signs of individuality,if not popularity. Yet for Richard, somehow the removable, clear, and noiselesstubes unnoticeable to the adults around him became like a giant noose around hisneck. He wanted no part of being different.Yet Richard was unmistakably different. He was 16 years old and dying.Despite that reality, he was almost magical in the love he constantly poured out tohis mother, his brother, and to those who cared for him. The \"Richard is amazing\"stories overflowed.The Contentious WorrywartAs amazing as he was, Richard worried a lot\u2014not about himself, butabout those around him. When he did not go to school because he was really sickor was forced to use oxygen, he worried about Bob, his friend and hired aide atschool. Bob was one of the individuals with whom Richard talked most about hisillness, in a fraternity of male bonding.\"He is very fond of Bob,\" said Richard's mom. \"When he didn't go toschool this week, he [Richard] was worried for Bob\u2014that Bob would be out of ajob, because he didn't have anything to do. I tell him, don't worry about Bob\u2014they'll find something for him to do,\" his mom added.54Look Ma, No Hands!Scholarship suggests humor is a critical coping mechanism during end-of-life times. Such was the case for Richard and his community. Although talking attimes was difficult given his breathing issues, he never failed to tell his hospicecare workers that they could only come back to his house and see him when theyhad first stopped by Toys-R-Us on the way.His mom told the story of when Richard first had his G-tube inserted foreating. \"He was in the hospital. His cousins came over to see him, and he said:'Watch. I'm going to show you a trick. Look, I'm eating: no hands!'\"The Dirt NapNot only did Richard make fun of his own physical situation, he made funof how society as a whole talks about the plight of those like him who are dying.Richard quite often used the word death in talking about himself and his situation.What he also enjoyed talking about even more were all the words or phrasespeople used in place of the \"D\" word. His list was priceless, and his smileunending as he shared each one:Kick the bucketBuy the farmCross the riverPushing up daisies55Taking a dirt napEven the hospice workers delighted in picking up on Richard's rhetorical cue. Itwas as if Richard set the tone about the language parameters for talking about hissituation. Without a doubt, he was comfortable with the word death. He neverseemed to deny the reality of his situation.Protectionism: The Man of the HouseWithin their family structure, Richard and his mom, and his little brother,Alonzo, spent a great deal of time and energy protecting each other. Alonzo wasborn perfectly healthy in 1998.Richard and Alonzo, who looked much the same, acted like normalbrothers. They wrestled and boxed with one another, played jokes on one another,got on each other's nerves, and most of all: protected one another. When thefamily was sent a new hospice nurse, Richard and his mom told the nurse sheneed not be offended when Alonzo tried to take over the situation to protect andhelp Richard. \"I said, please don't get offended. I said that sometimes, like whenhe [Richard] was coughing, and she [the new nurse] was 'Do you needyour bucket [to cough into]?' Well, Alonzo, he that's his job. He'll go andget it. [When mechanical] alarms go off [signaling goes and . . . says: 'That's my take care of mybig brother!'\"56The tireless hospice workers who help Richard love to tell about Alonzo'sparting words and rituals every evening when they finished taking care of hisbrother. \"Thank you for taking care of my brother,\" he would always say to them.After walking them out of the modest mobile home with the long blue wheelchairramp, Alonzo checks under their cars for strange things, or scans their cars withflashlights to make sure all is well for the evening. The hospice workers thankhim.Alonzo then asks them to beep their car horns at him so he will know theyare safe as they drive away. The same words are said, and the same actions takenalmost every evening. The noise of car horns beeping repeatedly brings simplecomfort and solace to a very grown-up 5-year-old boy named Alonzo\u2014a youngboy who loves his dying brother.Richard also worked hard to try and protect his mother from sadness andcrying, no easy task, she readily admits. \"He doesn't like for me to cry foranything,\" Richard's mom commented. To which Richard replied, \"She cries ateverything. You big baby!\" Richard then flashes his huge smile, and gazesaffectionately at his mom, who does not disagree with the assessment. She readilyadmits the tears flow easily, and always have. She uses much the same self-effacing humor as her son in responding: \"I cried the first day of school. I cry thelast day of school. I cry when he goes into another pant size,\" she laughed. Shedescribed her oldest son as being her protector\u2014\"my man of the house.\"57The Dying TalkRichard was extremely close to his grandfather. \"I love my grandpa,\"Richard commented. It was Richard's grandfather who would always hold himtight when Richard was feeling as if he were going to die.During these times, Richard's grandfather would console him by saying,\"When the time comes, who's going to be waiting for you on the other side?Remember? Who's going to be waiting there for you?\"\"Grandma,\" Richard would reply.Fight or Flight / Fight or FreedomOne of Richard's ultimate goals was not just to have a 16th birthday partyat Hooter's, but also to have a high school graduation party. His goal was tograduate with his class of 2006. He told his mom just recently: \"You know, Mom,instead of a birthday party, I want a graduation party. Oh, wow!\"Yet Richard never made his goal of graduating in 2006. He died in lateNovember of 2003, in the early morning hours of a Thanksgiving weekend.Perhaps for Richard there is a notion of \"fight or freedom,\" as compared tothe proverbial notion of \"fight or flight.\" Although his body failed to let him reachhis high school graduation goal in 2006, in no way did Richard run away fromdeath. In fact, he embraced his dying in the same way he embraced living. Hetalked about it with grace and humor far beyond his 16 years of age. Richard's58long-time school mentor, a gentleman far older than the 16-year-old, said as a partof his eulogy, \"I did not mentor Richard. Richard mentored me.\"Physical freedom now abounds for Richard. No longer does he have to betethered to or embarrassed by oxygen. No longer does he have to cough into abucket. Perhaps life on the other side, in whatever shape or form that may take,represents the final and truest form of freedom for Richard. His mother believesso.Before he died, Richard asked Dr. Johnson about her notion of Heaven.He explained to her that he wasn't worried about dying, but he was concernedabout missing all of his favorite television shows. Dr. Johnson reassured Richardthat televisions would be turned on 24 hours a day in Heaven. He could watchanything he wanted, anytime.EpilogueThe Hooters guy who embraced life, and taught so many others how to dothe same in the process, died quietly in his own bed at age 16, with his mothersleeping on the floor next to his side. The evening of his death, on the Saturdayafter Thanksgiving, he seemed to feel much better than earlier in the week. Hewanted to watch a movie, and said very clearly, \"I need a candy bar.\"He spent time with his adored grandfather, mother, and little brother. Hewas unusually concerned on that particular night about being clean. He wanted tomake sure his fingernails were all clean. He wanted his face to be perfectly clean-59shaven. He even asked his cherished grandfather to hand shave him after alreadybeing shaved with an electric razor. This was unusual behavior. His mom said itwas as if he were preparing for a new life in which he wanted to make a good firstimpression.When his mom awoke on her own accord in the middle of the morning,she immediately knew Richard was not breathing. For some reason he did nothave any coughing fits right before his death, unlike so many times before. Hiseyes were closed, and his mouth was no longer open as if fighting for his lastbreaths. His mom kissed him, and said at least now he would never have to wearoxygen again.During the funeral visitation time, Richard's treasured protector brother,Alonzo, worked the crowd in his crisp white button-down shirt, black creasedpants, and shiny patent shoes. Every few minutes Alonzo would glance at hismother, as if to make sure she was still standing. He would then return to theopen casket and touch the hand of his champion and departed brother, clothed in ablue high school sports jersey. Richard would have been, or was, proud.Perhaps the night of his death Richard knew what was going to happen.Maybe an unusual cleaning ritual became one way for Richard to prepare for whatwas to come. Maybe he wanted to look his very best to see others. Whatever thereason, being clean and extra-handsome on this one particular night seemed ofcritical importance.60In the words and beliefs of his grandfather, Richard most assuredly wasgoing to see his grandmother again, his guardian angel. She would reach down togive him a big hug and kiss, and say, \"Hi.\" The Hooters guy had indeedgraduated.C. Intellectual CapitalIn a capital city of a large state, a very smart and loving family rests a littleeasier now that their son, Marcus,5 age 5, is in remission from a rare andpotentially deadly form of leukemia. The cancer struck Marcus when he was 24months old.Web MD: The Ugly StuffMarcus's mom, Sandy, knew something was wrong. \"Marcus had beensick. He had been on antibiotics. We thought that he had an ear infection,\" shestated in a matter-of-fact manner. He was only 24 months old, and could notverbalize a lot. \"But you know, he just didn't look good,\" she added.Sandy was the first to diagnose Marcus as having leukemia. She continuedto be concerned about his overall appearance, and his inability to come back fromthe ear infection, or what could possibly have been the flu. \"I had actually gotten 5 In this story, I have changed the names of the people I call \"Marcus,\"\"Mom/Sandy,\" \"Dad/John,\" \"Debra,\" and \"Dr. Jones.\"61online thinking: What could this be? and had come across, you know, it's funny,because most kids, if they don't have the measles, mumps, flu, the basic stuff,then it goes immediately to the really ugly stuff. You know, like cancer,\" sheexplained.Sandy searched the web in detail. On one particular search engine, calledWeb MD, she entered Marcus's specific symptoms. The word leukemia appeared.\"I had a doctor's appointment for him to go back to the pediatrician, butthe night before, I went to a book store, and saw a book on leukemia. I just pickedit up, and just looked at the symptoms, and freaked out,\" Sandy said. The bookpresented the symptoms of leukemia in great detail, including joint pain that canmanifest itself in preventing children from wanting to walk. That was Marcus.\"That really triggered fear in my mind,\" she commented.The next afternoon was Marcus's appointment with a local pediatrician.Early that morning, Sandy called the pediatrician and asked: \"Can we just come innow?\" That morning the pediatrician told Sandy he did not think Marcus hadleukemia, but he would do a blood test just to make certain. \"He had this littlemachine in his office. Then he said 'This is definitely some kind of leukemia,'\"Sandy said. That was all the information he would give her at the time.Sandy took Marcus straight to the pediatric hospital. Dad (John) met themthere. Thus began the family's chaotic journey into the world of cancer. It began62almost as fast as Sandy had searched Web MD, and pulled up the word leukemia.Planes, Trains, and AutomobilesMarcus and his parents spent the first night at a local children's hospitaltrying to make arrangements for the future\u2014or at least the next 24 hours as theyredefined their new future. John commented: \"We thought that it was bad, butmore our take on it was, we need to find the best place in the world, and get on aplane and go there.\" The next day the family left for St. Jude Children's Hospitalin Memphis, Tennessee.Marcus's older sister, Debra, stayed behind with friends so that her fifthbirthday party scheduled that very day would not have to be cancelled. \"I went inmy imagination,\" sister Debra remembered. Parents John and Sandy didremember to cancel the dinner party they were having that evening, but theyforgot to notify everyone whom they had invited. While a few unaware dinnerguests stood on a darkened front porch, the family was well on its way to St. Jude.Chaos is an initial part of most pediatric cancer diagnoses.Low TonesLike most families, hearing the word cancer for a child triggers theonslaught of a waking nightmare. For some, the word is among the most ugly inthe English language. Like memories of that notable day in Dallas when PresidentJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated, nearly every parent of a child with anadvanced illness seems to remember the exact day and time when they were first63told of the situation. Some parents wet their pants, as one mother shared with me;some simply drop to the floor. Others have to have the message repeated,sometimes again and again.In the case of Marcus's family, the physician initially telling them thediagnosis of leukemia for certain said the word in such a low tone in an attempt tobe soothing that the family missed the diagnosis at first. \"I remember he [thephysician] was very soft spoken\u2014we couldn't hear him. I probably had awiggling toddler on my lap and some chattering. I remember not hearinganything,\" Sandy said. She asked that he repeat what he had just said.Research has long indicated that physicians struggle with the delivery ofbad news. Physicians working in pediatric care suggest that only in recent yearshas training been initiated in relatively small scales in medical schools wherebythey are taught how to work with the families of dying patients. Such was not thecase in the early 1980s. \"Doctors were taught to distance themselves emotionally,and I think that's wrong,\" a pediatric pulmonary physician states. \"You can't let itimpair your judgment, but I no longer fight it,\" she says.6Perhaps speaking softly is one way of attempting to soothe a family or todistance a person emotionally from the necessity of having to deliver devastatingnews. Whatever the reason, the physician spoke so softly that Sandy was forced to 6Pisano, M. (2003, August 18). Doctor says it's all right to be human. TheSan Antonio Express-News, pp. 1D, 4D.64have the word leukemia repeated at least once more before it finally soaked in toher psyche, literally and emotionally.Talking DownMarcus's parents are well-educated individuals. Both have strongacademic and professional credentials. Tackling Marcus's cancer from anintellectual capacity will always be a core strategy for the family. Included in thatprocess is the way in which Marcus's physicians communicate with Sandy andJohn as they direct their son's care. They respectfully contrast their hunger forstraightforward, smart, and recent detailed medical information with otherfamilies who may only want a thumbs up/thumbs down response.Plain talk, as John and Sandy call it, does not work with them, but theyrecognize and appreciate everyone's diversity in the range of information desired.\"Something that I know they [the physicians] struggle with, and it's a fine line, isnot to overwhelm the parent. There is just so much information to be reported,\"Sandy commented. \"My brain was just trying to reach back to college biology,you know, when you are talking about white cells and platelets. It can be verytechnical, trying to understand it,\" she added.Sending cues is important. Sandy commented: \"In talking with doctors, Ifind myself doing this when I encounter a new physician, is kind of sending themcues, you know, that we are educated. There is so much [to grasp]. They [thephysicians] are trying hard to make this understandable . . . putting things in very65simple terms. And we get frustrated with that because we both feel like we'veearned honorary degrees,\" she stated.In remembering the initial and subsequent conversations with the soft-spoken physician, Sandy recalled: \"I remember doing that [sending cues] with Dr.Jones. We told him very straight out: 'Look, we are both educated. Please don'ttalk down to us.'\"Options and AnswersJohn and Sandy wanted messages that delivered three things: (1) currentand detailed information; (2) answers; and (3) options. Generalizations andplatitudes became shrill violations against their self-images as youngprofessionals, and most especially as educated parents of a young child who hadcancer. Making decisions based on personalities or trite sayings was not an optionfor them.\"I remember I was talking with Dr. Jones on the phone that day, tellinghim that we had made the decision to go [to move Marcus from their hometownhospital to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee], and I said, that'smy advice from my sister who has the most medical training in my family. She'san oncology nurse, and I just have to trust that,\" Sandy stated. \"And his responsewas, 'I wish you would trust me.' I was just like, I so don't need this right now.\"Once the family arrived at St. Jude, they were given many options,answers and very detailed information as to how specific medical protocols would66be used on Marcus. Upon the family's initial arrival, the front-line medical staffspent at least 10 minutes simply explaining the features of the room in whichMarcus had been placed, long before conversations began about actual treatment.Even when the conversations did not represent options or answers for thefamily, somehow the St. Jude staff managed to deliver the messages in such a wayso as to avoid the gross generalizations and small talk that had initially frustratedthe parents. Both Sandy and John attributed the change in communication style atSt. Jude to a focus on research as opposed to practice.\"The doctor came in that night [the first night they arrived at St. Jude]. Hewas a resident. Not even a leukemia guy\u2014he's a solid tumor guy,\" Sandyexplained. \"He took a lot of information. That was part of what he was doing. Buthe also explained so much,\" Sandy recalled.\"And he wasn't hurried, he was just there. I think we probably spent about2 hours with him,\" she added. John quickly interjected, \"Which was funnybecause, the gist of what he really had to tell us was: 'We are not going to doanything until Monday morning.' I think it had to do with the difference of ahuman being and a focus on practice versus research,\" John said. \"These arepeople [at St. Jude] who actually do spend all their time when they are not treatingpatients thinking about better ways to treat patients\u2014better ways to fight thedisease,\" Marcus's dad explained.67A Language of WeirdnessMarcus spent many months at St. Jude. To this day, he and his parentscontinue to travel back and forth for follow-up treatments. He also continues tosee physicians in his hometown.When asked how the parents communicated with 2-year-old Marcusduring this initial time and during subsequent periods, both Sandy and Johnacknowledged doing \"weird\" things to both continually entertain and distractMarcus. Finding word substitutions became an important part of that language ofweirdness.For example, Marcus has always loved \"choo-choo\" trains. The pajamashe was wearing on the day of the interview, which he proudly showed to everyonein the room, were covered in colorful trains. He likes to make the sound of trains.Thus when Marcus first began treatment at age 2, the port that wassurgically placed into his body for the purpose of delivering his chemotherapybecame his choo-choo. The dressing placed on top of the port became the trainstation or the route. The little pillow that holds up the port became the platform.As he grew older Marcus began to send the family signals that he knewwhat was going on with his body. He began to understand what the actual medicalwords meant, and what certain treatments would entail. Sandy recalled: \"And thenone time, you know we would always [in front of Marcus] call it [the port] choo-choo, and we would talk to the nurses about the port,\" she explained. One time68Marcus turned to his mother out of nowhere and said: \"That's not my choo-choo,that's my port!\" Marcus was approximately 3 at the time.Marcus also quickly picked up a lot of the medical terminology beyondthe word port. When the time came for Marcus to receive shots or take medicines,Sandy would usually say to her husband in front of Marcus: \"I think it's time toadminister his pharmaceuticals,\" a way to say medicine without him running. Yetshe explained that even as early as age 3, Marcus knew what was coming when heheard the phrase administer his pharmaceuticals. \"He knew. He caught on veryquickly,\" Sandy said.Statistics, Sanctuary Spots, and Verb TensesKnowing the details associated with pediatric cancer and leukemia data iscritically important to Sandy and John. They view themselves as intellects andcontinually study and learn the many statistics associated with their son's disease.Without looking at a sheet of paper, they succinctly told me that 1 in 2million children is diagnosed each year with the same kind of leukemia Marcushas experienced. This figure represents what they call nightmares for 1 in every10,000 children just like their son. The stakes are high, and the chances forreoccurrence prevalent.Fortunately Marcus remains in remission to date. The parents are quick tocorrect me when I mistakenly refer to Marcus's disease in the present tense. Theydo not want Marcus described as a young person who has leukemia.69\"Actually Marcus doesn't have leukemia. He's in remission. Well, he'sstill on treatment, so it's kind of a personal choice on words\u2014ones that we thinkare important, and we certainly emphasize with him,\" Sandy explained as shecorrected me. \"He probably went into remission day seven of treatment, whichmost kids with leukemia do. But they still think that on a molecular level, he stillmight have leukemia, so they continue to treat him for about 3 years. But theirclinical definition of remission most kids reach in the first month,\" she added. Thefamily remains ever vigilant in keeping up with the latest technology andinformation on the disease as their son continues to receive treatment on aprevention basis.Reassurances and ChoicesDespite being frequently frustrated with physicians who deliver messagesin ways perceived too simplistic or patronizing, both John and Sandy are gratefulfor the medical care and technology they have found both in Memphis and theirhometown. It has kept Marcus alive so far.This time in their lives is spent holding each other close, enjoying lazySaturday mornings, reminiscing, looking at photographs, and reading the latestinformation on leukemia. Marcus and his 8-year-old sister, Debra, seemexceptionally close. They look out and take care of each other.People tell John and Sandy they are parents to be admired for theirunending reliance on intellectual capital in responding to Marcus's cancer. They70are told they come across as extremely poised and graceful in the many ways inwhich they have faced this chapter in their lives. They suggest otherwise:Mom/Sandy:It's not always that graceful.Dad/John:\u2014graceful, nor pretty.Mom/Sandy:Stress brings out a lot of ugly.Revisiting their son's initial cancer diagnosis and the early days and months ofMarcus's cancer at age 2 is not something Sandy nor John care to do. However,they choose to do so in an effort to provide both education and reassurance toother parents in similar situations.\"I know there have been studies on what kind of information parents wishthey had heard, and one thing that doctors don't tend to address, that parentsreally want to hear\u2014it's like the 4th most requested thing: reassurance,\" Sandyexplained. \"You need a lot of assurance that you caught this as soon as youpossibly could have. That this wasn't neglect\u2014every parent I know completelybeats themselves up over it.\"She added: \"That's funny, it's really like a first stage thing. You really arecaught up in why. Then it goes out the window. And you don't think about why,ever again. That's the way it is,\" she declared.71D. Praising Life: The Final ChapterShannon and David Ede and their children are individually andcollectively one of the most physically beautiful families I have ever seen.Together they look much like an ensemble cast on a Hollywood movie screen.Mom Shannon looks like Nicole Kidman, complete with long, wavy red hair andporcelain skin. Dad David looks like Kevin Klein. Their 3 children, Patrick andhis siblings, Daniel and Ellen, are equally beautiful with translucent smiles,smooth complexions, and sparkling eyes. The family smiles and laughs a lot.They obviously enjoy being together.Yet their world of physical beauty and happy times became an emotionalnightmare on November 26, 2002, when 12-year-old Patrick was diagnosed withAcute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Here is their story, beginning with a look at thedisease that hit their family.7Growing Pains and Visceral ResponsesThe American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute identifyleukemia as the most common form of cancer in children and adolescents. It 7 At the suggestion of The Ede family, information from various Internetsites such as the Patrick Ede CaringBridge web site retrieved fromhttp://www.caringbridge.org/tx/patrickede, along with a review of a videotapedchurch celebration led by his parents to thank friends and supporters, has beenused to supplement the interview commentary.72accounts for nearly one-third of all cancers in children under the age of 15, andone-fourth of all cancers occurring before the age of 20.8Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a rare form of pediatric leukemia. It isa cancer of the blood-forming tissue usually found in the bone marrow and lymphnodes. The bone marrow of persons with leukemia begins producing largenumbers of abnormal and immature blood cells that are usually white blood cells.These bad cells are often called blasts. Blasts flood the blood and lymph streams,and then may invade vital organs such as the brain, testes, ovaries, or skin. Insome rare cases, AML tumor cells may form solid tumors called IsolatedGranulocytic Sarcoma (IGS) or Chloroma.Early signs of AML may include fever, chills, bleeding or bruising,swollen lymph nodes, and other symptoms that are flu-like such as weakness,chronic weariness, or aching bones and joints. In Patrick's case, 2 days beforeThanksgiving in 2002, he went to his physician. He was hurting badly.\"My bones had been hurting more. My arms and legs had really beenhurting, and I couldn't sleep at night because it hurt so much. And I thought it wasgrowing pains. So we went to the doctor, and asked if we could see blood work.And later, he diagnosed me,\" Patrick calmly stated at age 12. 8 Cancer Reference Information (2003, n.d.). What are the key statisticsabout childhood leukemia? Retrieved Jan. 2, 2004, fromhttp://www.cancer.org/docroot/cri/content/.73Parents use a variety of words and phrases to describe their reactions tohearing the news for the first time that one of their children has cancer. Somecalmly rattle off long names of specific diseases. Others take a chronological,journal-like approach. They tell you where they specifically went each day, whatthey did, who saw them, where, and what the physicians, nurses, and others saidat every point of the journey. In some cases, the reactions are beyond words anddescriptions.\"Just for the record, I mean, we all had moments,\" Shannon, Patrick'smom explained. \"When I first heard [Patrick's diagnosis], I had a visceralresponse,\" she added. She explained that in actuality she wet her pants and thecarpet in the physician's office, for which she later apologized. The physician toldher not to worry\u2014it had happened before with other parents.Patrick's father, David, also had his moments of despair and darkness.Shannon describes a memorable moment for her husband that occurred later on intheir son's illness when the pain for Patrick was excruciatingly horrible. \"Davidlaid out on the hospital floor one time, in tears, because he [Patrick] was in pain,and the morphine wasn't touching his pain, and the nurses weren't responding,and it was so frustrating.\" There is a sense in talking with this family that fatherDavid seldom loses his composure.Regardless of what came the family's way, the young boy at the center ofthe storm seemed to rise above it all. \"I think Patrick is given a special grace74because I have seen him respond more negatively emotionally to algebra beforeand since cancer, than he did the whole thing [the cancer journey]. I'm notkidding you. I think he was really given a special grace,\" she said.Shannon also talks about her son and his philosophy regarding his illnesswithin a schema of control. She is proud that Patrick remains in control of his owndecision-making and life living, to the extent humanly possible. Shannon suggestsPatrick sees himself in being in control of his destiny: \"Not to get boring, he's justfairly in control, of thinking 'OK, this is my responsibility in setting this thing.'\"Another verbal exchange reaffirmed much the same sentiment. It alsoadded a perspective held by the whole family: They are not alone in the journey.Mom/Shannon: We explained to him that he has cancer, . . . but he wasshockingly accepting right from the start.Question: [Asked of Patrick.] Any idea why?Patrick: I knew that it was in God's hands.In a Matter of HoursParents of children with advanced diseases view time differently. Timeframes are much shorter and bound by upcoming treatments and physician visits.Weeks may seem like an eternity in the worlds of children and youngpeople who have cancer. Minutes and hours seem to dictate a cancer family'scalendar as they try and cope with what has now become a different type of long-term future. The Ede family web site, www.caringbridge.org/tx/patrickede/,75described one particular day in the almost-daily postings of Patrick's progress interms of hourly time limits:December 5, 2002: Patrick gets to go home for about 30 hours.Upon the initial diagnosis, the family remembered that Patrick started onchemotherapy within a matter of hours. The simple difference in expectationsfrom one hour or one day to the next can bring major highs or lows.Patrick and his parents also remembered an especially joyful time inwhich he ran ahead of schedule. \"He [Patrick] surprised us the day that he got outof isolation. This time, day 21 would be the earliest that he should ever come out.But he had recovered enough to where it was safe for him to come on out,\"Shannon said. \"But Patrick, on day 14, his white cells rebounded, and [he] made agreat recovery, so he was a week earlier on getting out of isolation. I was going toget my mask and gloves on, and he said, 'No, Mamma.' Then those tears juststarted coming, and he came in and hugged all of us, and we're all boo-hooing,\"she added.Cybersphere Prayers: The Birth of CommunicationThe Patrick Ede web site is one of the saving graces mentioned repeatedlyby the family. Patrick's Uncle Johnny created the site. It is a part of the CaringBridge organization, an organization designed to help seriously ill children andyoung people and their families stay in touch and be informed throughout theirhealthcare journeys. Shannon describes the web site and the communication76available to her at her fingertips as the \"birth of communication\u2014it's just huge.He [Patrick] can communicate with other people. So now it will allow us to rallysupport, and can also tell us what we need. People right away started sending use-mails and stuff, telling us jokes, and to try and reach him,\" she added.Patrick enjoyed the web site because it allowed him to hear from not onlyhis healthy friends, but also other cancer kids and seriously ill kids who made himsmile. When asked if he personally looked at the e-mails, he responded: \"Yeah, awhole bunch. There are little 6 year olds, you know, saying, 'Now I've got a jokethat I would like to tell,'\" Patrick added.Shannon viewed the web site as cathartic both for her husband andPatrick. \"He [David] would sit down there and daily, see what's going on. It wasmore than . . . just a lot of medical facts. There were some spiritual things that wewere learning, or things that we all needed. So it was really a helpful thing. It wasnice for me to not have to carry that because with any burden, I get impatient. Fornow, he [husband, David] could just do that, and it took some of the stress offPatrick, too,\" she explained.Patrick's parents perceived a variety of benefits from the web site.Shannon suggested the web represented a method for people all over the world towrite to the family, and \"at our leisure we could read through them. The guestwould write, and they would send prayers and jokes and stories and so that way, it77was a no hassle way of communicating effectively. Like we could look at that ifwe wanted to, or we didn't have to,\" she added.The family also believes this new birth in communication is a way forpatients such as Patrick to avoid becoming isolated in an environment wheresometimes direct contact can be costly, if not deadly. \"When he [Patrick] wasreally so sick, he did not get out and interact with the kids at the children'shospital here,\" Shannon says. \"He's kind of introverted. He never felt wellenough to get out there. We did see this one boy who was the same age who wasout there yukkin' up with the nurses. We were going, 'What, are you really sick?'In the MDA [MD Anderson Cancer Center], he (Patrick) had never really felt wellenough to go there and make friends with the kids, but there you are in isolationwhere you are not allowed to be outside. It was kind of, he got peer support fromthe web site because it was easier to write to people that way,\" Shannon stated.David also says that the web site, which contained daily updates onPatrick's condition, as well as his whereabouts, represented a much-preferredmethod of communication for families like his. \"It's so much better than e-mailbecause e-mail is sort of a push type of communication: Here I'm pushing this toyou. But the web site was more pull. It was basically: Here it is if you areinterested. So, it wasn't very intrusive communication,\" he added.The web site also became a way to ask for help, and to sort throughemotions throughout the hospital vigils. The family routinely asked for people to78rally on Patrick's behalf in terms of prayers when times became really tough.David also used the routine of connecting with the web site as a form of sense-making. \"That was actually an exercise in discipline for me to have to sit down atthe end of the day, and do all the events, all my emotions, all my thoughts,\" Davidsaid. \"It sort of made sense. . . . So that was real good for me. Also, people wantto know [what is happening, moment by moment],\" he commented.The Three-Finger Roller CoasterReal-life activities of daily living remind us that conversing with childrenand young people in the best of times is frequently challenging. Thus whenchildren like Patrick are thrust into a foreign and frightening world like that ofcancer, parents often search for new and simplistic ways to explain to theirchildren harsh and complicated scientific realities. In Patrick's case, nonverbalcommunication became an increasingly important way of understanding what washappening on a daily basis, and what was to yet come.\"We were trying to get him ready for Houston [the MD Anderson CancerCenter]. First of all, we were trying to give him a scope for a differentenvironment,\" Shannon said. \"I showed him three fingers, and that was threedifferent phases that we were going through,\" she added.Both Shannon and David used the three-finger method throughout thejourney to help Patrick gauge where he was in his treatment plan, and what wasawaiting him around the corner. The three-finger method became an explanatory79tool for helping Patrick understand the initial phases of his treatment whichincluded induction therapy, in which chemotherapy is used to try and kill as manyof the leukemia cells as possible so that the disease will go in to remission, andthen the second and third phases, intensification and consolidation therapy,designed to kill any remaining leukemia cells once the leukemia is in remission.The three-finger method became a calendar for the family in terms ofholiday and major events. Because Patrick was first diagnosed duringThanksgiving week, treatments were being given in the midst of the Thanksgivingand Christmas seasons. Shannon would anticipate Patrick's questions, such as\"Where is Christmas going to be?\" She explained: \"Christmas is going to be rightaround here. You will still be in the hospital, just so you kind of know,\" shereplied. Throughout the conversation, she again referenced a certain number offingers along with specific points along her fingers and the areas in between.Shannon's nonverbal, picturesque method of communicating using this three-finger method almost seemed to parody a roller coast ride, with higher momentsat the tops of the tracks, and then the inevitable extreme dips or lows that werejust ahead of the curves in each stage of the treatment. \"I would say: 'So, Patrick,here is where we are right now: We're this far, and you still have this far you needto go.' We kind of always had a scope ahead of him,\" she explained.80Bone Marrow TransplantationOne of the more successful moments of the journey that eventually led toPatrick's remission came in the form of a bone marrow transplant (BMT).According to the National Cancer Institute, bone marrow transplantation is anewer type of treatment against AML in which a patient's bone marrow isreplaced with healthy bone marrow from another person whose tissue is the sameor almost the same as the patient's. Bone marrow transplantation takes place oncehigh doses of chemotherapy are given in order to destroy all of the bone marrowin the diseased body.9Again the family turned to the web to make an appeal for individuals tovolunteer so they could be tested for possible matches with Patrick. OnDecember 14, 2002, many people came forward. Within that population, oneindividual wanted desperately to help Patrick more than anyone: his little brother,Daniel. As Shannon explained, \"All Daniel wanted to do was be the donor, that'sall he wanted to do.\"It's Me! It's Me! It's Me!On December 17, 2002, a match donor for Patrick was identified. Over150 people, including Patrick's brother and younger sister, Ellen, had willingly 9 National Cancer Institute (2002, Aug. 19). Childhood acute myeloidleukemia/other myeloid malignancies. Retrieved Jan. 2, 2004, fromhttp://www.cancer.gov/templates/doc_pdq.81agreed to be tested as possible bone marrow matches for Patrick. Human naturesuggests that some of them, including sister Ellen, breathed a sigh of relief whensomeone else was identified.Less than one month after Patrick's first diagnosis, younger brother Danielfound out he would get his Christmas wish: to be a bone marrow donor for hisbrother. When Daniel first heard the news, his mom said the reddish-hairedexuberant boy went running through the house, jumping up and down, andshouting over and over at the top of his lungs: \"It's me!!! It's me!!! It's me!!!\"On the afternoon of March 11, 2003, Daniel underwent a bone marrowaspiration in which bone marrow was taken from his body in one part of the MDAnderson Cancer Center, while Patrick waited in another. The boys' parents saidthe first words out of Daniel's mouth after the procedure were as follows: \"[Did] Ihelp my brother?\" \"Then,\" as Shannon laughingly remembered, \"he just blowschow all over the place, you know, because he's feeling awful.\"Nonverbal communication again became important to the family. \"Theylet Daniel out of his procedure. We went straight up to see Patrick, and to let himknow that his bone marrow was coming,\" Shannon explained. \"There wasn't a lotof fanfare from the doctors [in terms of Daniel's donating his bone marrow]. Iwas walking through while the doctors were finishing their paperwork, and thenurses were over there. I was like, 'Hey, let's give it up for the donor!' I madeeverybody applaud,\" she said.82Patrick received Daniel's bone marrow beginning early that same evening.Twelve days later his blood counts improved to the point he could be removedfrom isolation. On March 25, 2003, Patrick was released from MD Anderson.As of this writing, Patrick remains at home in remission. His head is nowfull of beautiful dark hair, and he no longer looks like Gollum from The Lord ofthe Rings trilogy, as another young boy called him when he went bald fromreceiving massive amounts of chemotherapy. If not for the white surgical maskPatrick occasionally wears in public, one might never know of his ordeal or thathe has had any experiences different from any other healthy 12-year-old boy.On Wednesday, October 29, 2003, the family posted the following updateon their web site:Patrick is doing really well. We're back from 2 weeks in Californiaand we had a great time, thanks to the Make-a-Wish Foundation(www.wish.org). We arrived in Burbank on October 11, spentseveral days in Ventura with Shannon's brother, then rented a 25-foot motor home and drove up the coast along Highway 1 north.We camped along the way at Morro Bay, Big Sur River, thenCarmel for 2 nights, then landed in Yosemite where we stayed 5days. It was absolutely gorgeous. We were all in awe of the beautyof God's creation and could not stop looking up at the tall trees andhuge mountains all around. The weather was perfect. We sleptabout 10 hours per night. We could not have asked for more.Patrick continues to do well. He has not had any serious illnesssince being released from MD Anderson 7 months ago! One reasonthat we chose to rent an RV and go camping was because wewanted to avoid large crowds and too many public places, due toPatrick's immune suppression. Although all of his clinic visits andlab tests have been positive, he is only 7 months past his bonemarrow transplant, and he is still at risk for illness, infection, andrelapse.83Eye on the Storm: Beginning with DataPatrick's parents talked about a variety of responses both have observedfrom other parents experiencing the horror of having children with cancer. Theytalk about the anger response, which Shannon suggested stemmed largely fromthe \"nag of feminine frustration.\" They talked about the running-and-hidingresponse, in which you continually say \"God help us.\"Through their own emotional roller coasters, they continue to experienceboth anger and an intense desire to run and hide. Shannon remembered the timewhen the family went by the MD Anderson chapel to pray. A statue of an angelwas in the room. At the bottom of the statue were the words: Fear Not.Shannon recalled: \"And so my heart is going boom, boom, boom. I'mterrified at this point. God, you know how your first encounter with something isusually the right way and everything else seems to be wrong? Even though weknow that, we were like, Do this right; do this right. We were kind of irritated.And I see this 'Fear Not,' and I'm about to come unglued, and I think it's OK tofall apart. And I said [to Patrick], 'Don't be scared. It says \"fear not.\"' But he wasfine,\" she added.Patrick has sustained his family throughout this trauma; and they havesustained him. The family holds tight to each other, physically and emotionally,and continues to work hard to keep focused on the situation at hand, as they did84when Patrick was in the three phases of his treatment. They refuse to continuallyhide. Even when they do, they know that \"God will hear us,\" David said.\"There are a number of emotional features that helped me\u2014gave me focusand make sense,\" . \"And one of them was,you know, on a daily basis, we would talk to a doctor, and get certain numbers ofcertain statistics,\" he described. \"Well, you know, our latest test shows this andthat means this, and there is this percent chance that this might happen. Thesenumbers are important.\" Data became an increasingly important component forthe family's ability to remain focused on the eye of whatever storm was comingtheir way. Data also became an ongoing mechanism for a more spiritualunderstanding of the family's definition of truth.Truth and RealityPatrick's dad used a Biblical illustration to convey his family's notion ofreal truth beyond data-driven numbers and statistics. It's the story of Peter'schallenge of Jesus to prove His identity by walking on water.David gave an overview of the story: \"They [the disciples] were on a boatin a big storm. And they were scared, and they said, 'What is that, his [Jesus']ghost?' And he said 'No, it's ours.' And Peter said, 'OK, if it's really you, thenyou step out of the boat.' Peter walks out and, do you remember the story, he'sdoing OK. Then, the Bible says he starts to see the waves, and he takes his eyes85off his goal. He starts to look at that stuff that gets in his way. And when thishappens, he starts to sink.\"David continued with the analogy by explaining that once when someoneasked him how he copes with his family's situation, he responded: \"We have allthese facts and all this junk, all this medical junk. You can't focus. Then you sink.It's not that you don't consider it\u2014you don't ignore it. The question is, what areyour eyes going to focus on? So Peter had a choice, and he made the wrongchoice. So we had a choice too. Now, are we going to look at the facts? These aremedical facts, they are statistics, but they are not the truth. The truth for us is thatGod loves us, and that He is always with us, no matter what happens to us,\"David said.Shannon is quick to add that for her family, spirituality is not like abandage or a pat on the back. \"It was what your next breath was based on,\" shestated. She is also fully aware that sometimes there is a different outcome. \"Wesaw some other reality checks. They [MD Anderson Cancer Center] lost some 31kids . . . . In these next 3 months, things can change on the turn of a dime. So thereality is out there. We were just thankful that he [Patrick] is still here, and we getto do these new things,\" she added. In the midst of whatever new things cometheir way, the family members will continue to rely on the help and grace ofothers that has sustained them thus far.86It Takes a VillageFollowing Patrick's release from MD Anderson Cancer Center, the Edefamily stood center stage on July 27th in a Praise Celebration at their church infront of approximately 250 friends, family, and general well-wishers who came tocelebrate Patrick's remission and homecoming. These were individuals who hadliterally circled the family's Round Rock, Texas home in a prayer vigil. Theywere men and women who had donated blood. They were folks who had offeredto give up some of their bone marrow. They had mowed the family's lawn,cleaned their home repeatedly, home-schooled Patrick's siblings, and deliveredcasseroles on top of casseroles. They had prayed and acted without ceasing. Theywere valiant heroes to these 5 individuals.Shannon and David spoke to the crowd, at times crying and at other timestalking in clear united voices, firm and full with gratitude. They namedindividuals by name, and by deed. They thanked groups of people. Theyremembered the day when they first drove to Houston, to a new and unknowncancer hospital in a much larger city, only to find their local pastor from backhome sitting in the lobby waiting for them to arrive. He was there simply to be onhand if they needed anything, including the comfort that comes from seeing afamiliar face in a strange location during times of angst.For Shannon and David, and countless other families in which a child hasa life-threatening illness, reliance on the outstretched hands of others may seem at87first to be a sign of weakness or at a minimum, unfamiliarity. Soon enough,however, it becomes a matter of necessity and survival. As the family posted ontheir web site: \"We continue to find reasons to praise God, and that includes eachof you.\" As the family tearfully hugged each other before the auditorium crowd,Patrick said simply and quietly into the microphone: \"Thank you all.\"The Last ChapterData from the American Cancer Society show a 40 percent chance for a 5-year survival rate for children with AML like Patrick. Advances in treatmentcontinue to improve the odds, as may be the case for Patrick, so that he may livewell beyond his 12 years of age. For now, the family celebrates small yetsignificant victories\u2014like nine plus months of remission.David and Shannon fully understand the correlation between data and thetruth. They know now is a critical time. \"Although all his clinic visits and lab testshave been positive, he [Patrick] is only seven months past his bone marrowtransplant. He is still at risk for illness, infection, and relapse. For the next 4 or 5months, we will be going to MD Anderson once every 3 or 4 weeks. This is acritical time. One of Patrick's physicians told us that patients who relapse withinthe first year usually relapse at the very end of their first year period. This may bedue to the fact that any residual chemotherapy drugs have been eliminated fromthe patient's body toward the end of the first year, and that may allow anyremaining leukemia to reformulate,\" they wrote on their web site.88Yet in their minds and hearts this is not the final chapter for the Edefamily, regardless of the data, the odds, or the possibility of a relapse for Patrick.The final chapter, for this beautiful family, is one that is yet to come. It representsthe real truth of life for them: God saves you.Patrick knows God will save him in some form or fashion, even if itmeans departing this earth following a relapse. His parents and siblingswholeheartedly agree that their collective final chapters are yet to come, and showlittle resemblance to life on this earth. For the time being, Patrick and his familyare grateful for the present moments in their lives. As they posted on their website:Again, this is a great reminder that there are no guaranteesregarding our future on this planet, and that applies to all of us.Although we know our ultimate destination, we do not know howor when we will be ushered from this life to the next, or how muchpleasure we will enjoy or suffering we will endure until that time.We are grateful for today, and grateful for the guarantee of lifeeternal in Heaven.E. Leonzo's LeadLeonzo10 is 13 years old. For more than half of his life, he has wrestledwith cancer. He was 6 when initially handed the diagnosis of leukemia. Leonzo'sspecific form of leukemia is called Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). The 10 In this story, I have changed the names of the people I call \"Leonzo\"and \"Dr. Pete.\"89American Cancer Society predicted in 2003 that approximately 2,200 children inthe United States would be diagnosed with ALL. Because of the advances beingmade in treatment over time, the 5-year-survival rate for ALL patients is nownearly 80 percent.11TristeDespite his young age, Leonzo wears many hats and juggles many balls inhis battle with cancer. He is a first-generation English speaker. His mom speaksonly Spanish. Because most of his healthcare staff members speak only English,Leonzo has assumed the primary role of decision-maker and translator regardinghis own healthcare.People all around Leonzo seem to rely heavily on him. For a young boywho does not care to talk very much, he is frequently placed at center stage, atleast as observed on the afternoon of our interview. He consistently translatedmessages for his mother and directed the staff regarding his medical needs. Heseemed to be familiar with the role of a take-charge, albeit quiet, leader.At age 6, Leonzo had a sense that something was physically wrong withhim, but no one initially said anything directly to him. When asked how he knewsomething was amiss, he replied, \"Because I looked at my mom, and she was 11 Cancer Reference Information (2003, n.d.). What are the key statisticsabout childhood leukemia? Retrieved Jan. 2, 2004, fromhttp://www.cancer.org/docroot/cri/content/.90sad.\" When I responded to that statement using the Spanish word, triste, for sad,Leonzo's mom, who was sitting quietly nearby, said faintly, \"Si, triste.\"Perhaps she is referring to sadness then and now, and all the years inbetween during which Leonzo has battled cancer. On this particular day, the skyis gray and gloomy, and Leonzo has just completed another week in a pediatricpalliative care hospital\u2014his home away from home. He hoped to leave thehospital that night. He will most likely return again.Just a WordLeonzo is the first to tell you he has leukemia. He understands theimportance of blood cultures and numbers, and the worry that comes with theonset of a slight fever, like the one that put him back in the hospital. However,things have changed over time in that Leonzo was not always told what washappening with his body, especially when he was much younger.Initially several days passed before Leonzo was first told he was sick,even though he already knew something was wrong. Although he was only 6 atthe time, he distinctly remembered the first time he officially learned he hadleukemia:Question:So, a few days passed [during which he noticed his mombeing sad], and your mom came in, and said . . . ?Leonzo:[Finishing the question] \u2014she told me I had leukemia.And I took it as just a word.Question:Just a word? Did you know what that meant?91Leonzo:No.Question:What did you think?Leonzo:Nothing.Question:Did you ask her what it meant to you?Leonzo:No.Even though he asked little at the time, Leonzo seemed to remember a great deal.He remembered not talking about his illness at the onset. He recalled closelywatching his mom for a cue as to how things were going with him. Heremembered, although somewhat vaguely, talking periodically to his primaryphysician, Dr. Pete, whom he calls \"a nice guy.\" \"He's been nice to me,\" Leonzoexplained. His physician seems to be one of the few persons with whom Leonzotalks about his illness, even to this day.Talking in general is not something Leonzo likes to do. He answeredinterview questions in brief form, usually with a yes or no answer, although hewas extremely polite in conversing. Despite his brevity, however, he seemedgenuinely interested in and willing to tell his story\u2014perhaps for no other reasonthan his friend Dr. Pete asked him to. \"Do you ever like to talk about it [hisillness]?\" I asked. \"No. I don't talk that much,\" he replied.92Diversions and MemoriesLeonzo has both older and younger siblings. They visit him in the hospital,where \"we just play,\" he explained. They like to tell jokes and most of all, playNintendo on the computer. Sometimes Leonzo wins. Sometimes he loses.Leonzo and his siblings prefer game playing and joke telling in lieu ofdirect conversation. Outside the sibling circle, Leonzo sometimes uses humorabout his own illness as a way to find new friends. \"If I didn't have this illness, Icouldn't meet more persons,\" he stated, explaining that his illness presents a wayfor him to meet new people\u2014\"at least, I think, a few of them,\" he added. Heavoided going into greater detail on his thoughts in these areas, despite probing onmy part.Sometimes Leonzo likes to hear stories. Yet most of the time he prefersavoiding such conversation. \"It brings memories,\" he says quietly, looking triste,much like his mother.Dragons and TigersLeonzo sits in his home away from home, one of the rooms at the pediatrichospital. He spends a lot of the time looking out the window of what he calls his\"second living room.\" He likes to play Nintendo and tell jokes. He likes to draw.Specifically he likes to draw cars and flowers\u2014and dragons and tigers.93Much of his time is spent keeping up to date with his healthcare status forthe day. He listens closely to the numbers being given to him by his physiciansand nurses about blood counts, bodily temperatures, cell levels, culture results,and on and on. He is told by people who are quickly moving in and out of hisroom that certain treatments will happen for that particular day provided previoustests turn out the way they are expected. Intravenous (IV) fluids and antibioticsare hung, and then taken down when the beepers go off. New bags are hung.Everything happens almost automatically, yet the talk is often tough.Tough TalkLeonzo seemed to be like many other young cancer patients in that hepreferred to hear \"straight talk\" about his condition. During that particularafternoon of the interview, that was exactly what he was given\u2014straight talk fromthe hospital staff:Staff Nurse:I talk to Leonzo like he's my son. I tell him, and I'd behonest with him, I'd tell him: You need to take thismedicine, this medicine sucks, it tastes nasty, but youare going to have to take it. You know that. And that'sit, don't I? [Staff nurse looked at Leonzo, and Leonzonodded]. And then when he doesn't get up in themorning, I would take him my little normal saline andstart dripping them on his head. Then he wakes up.Don't I? [Staff nurse again looked at Leonzo, who said,\"Yeah.\"] [I] tell him he's going to eat his breakfast. Ifhe doesn't, I'm going to eat it. His mama always bringshim food. I don't know why we even have meals forhim. Huevos and potatoes, and his mom brings himtacos with hot sauce.94The tough talk from the staff continued in front of Leonzo:Staff Nurse:[Looking at Leonzo] You know you have leukemia.That took over the transplant. There is nothing more wecan do. When the leukemia takes over, you are going togo to Heaven. And only God is going to decide whenyou go to Heaven. When is that going to happen to you?Maybe in 3 months, maybe 3 years, maybe 30 years. It'swhen you get sick, you could die. So that is why wehave to give you these drugs, these antibiotics, to keepyou from getting sicker. . . . I know you have ALL [aserious form of leukemia], and I know you are going todie. But I don't care. I'm going to spend the time that Ihave with you having fun.Looking AheadLeonzo wonders about the future. He prefers to think of himself now andin his future as a \"normal\" rather than a \"sick\" person. At times throughout theconversation he seemed more willing to think ahead. At other points, he becamequite reticent.Someday Leonzo hopes to become a physician. When asked what kind ofphysician he wanted to be, he replied: \"Like Dr. Pete.\" Dr. Pete is the tirelesshead of the hospital where Leonzo spends much of his time. He has taken care ofLeonzo for the past seven years. One suspects Dr. Pete as being Leonzo's closestconfidant. He is certainly his role model.Leonzo's reticence about the future stems from one kernel of truth: thingsare uncertain. What the future holds for Leonzo is highly ambiguous. He himselfholds his cards close to his chest in the form of brief answers and few95explanations. The uncertainty is troublesome and at times, sad, for Leonzo. Itcontinues to make his mom triste. She is turning to the Bible for help andunderstanding.Leonzo says hearing the staff talk about his dying makes him sad at times,but it does not worry him. He still sleeps well at night. He may draw dragons andtigers, but he does not seem to dream about them.As his staff nurse said, Leonzo could live for 3 more months, or maybe 30years, although the latter is unlikely given the ALL disease, and his presentmedical problem of fever spikes and frequent hospital visits. The hardest part is inthe not knowing. Leonzo says he prefers not to talk to his mother or sisters orbrothers at times because \"Sometimes they ask me questions I can't answer.Because I don't know.\"In the meantime, Leonzo will continue to lead the way on directing hisown healthcare journey, regardless of how much longer he lives. The staff says hecontinues to have a good handle on his situation. As the afternoon of treatmentsand waiting draws to a close, a staff member says to the 13-year-old who hasknown sickness longer than not:OK, I've got other patients, guy. So at 5 o'clock, in a few minutes,we will start our report, and I'm going to come back by and takesome blood, and you will be discharged. A few minutes from nowthe doctor should be here, so I'm looking at a quarter of seven youshould go home. So you will need to let your mama know.The directions to Leonzo continued to flow from the adult to the 13-year-old:96There was some morphine, some boxes of morphine the pharmacywon't send up, so you will have to stop and get them on the wayout. One of the healthcare nurses will come to your house to takecare of you, and give you more medicines. So let's say seveno'clock. It looks like you are already packed. Are you ready to go?As Leonzo nodded affirmatively, he again looked around the room, and glanced athis mom who was eagerly awaiting the latest translation from her 13-year-old son.Leonzo has grown up fast. The scene represents an acute case of role reversal.Before the interview closed, I asked Leonzo another question about hisown 7-year journey of illness and what others might learn from his experiences.\"If there was another patient in here who had just been diagnosed with leukemialike you were in 1997, what would you say to him or her?\"\"Never give up,\" Leonzo replied with a smile.F. AuthenticityAt age 18, Eduardo12 is a wise sage who sat cross-legged in the middle ofhis hospital bed and philosophized about his life. Although he wishes he couldlive up north in the cold with the benefit of being \"bundled up in blankets,\" heactually lives in an area that is usually warm. He lives with his mother. Becauseof the weather, he does not particularly care for living where he does because it is 12 In this story, I have changed the name of the person I call \"Eduardo.\"97\"summer year around.\" Living up north also appeals to Eduardo because there\"ain't millions of people\" crowded into a small space.Although he loves the idea of living in the cold, Eduardo does not actuallylike to be cold. He shivered frequently during the interview, and asked that hishospital room temperature be raised from 70 to 85 degrees to ease his chilledbody.RealityShivering is a function of Eduardo's life in that he has a form of cancercalled Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). He described it as a \"basic blooddisorder.\" Although his initial diagnosis in the spring of 2001 came with what hewas told was a \"high rate of being cured,\" he relapsed 2 months prior to theinterview.Cancer is not new to Eduardo's family. When his parents divorced,Eduardo, an only child, said he had to move out. He did not elaborate why. Helived a big part of his life with his aunt who currently comes to see him frequentlyin the hospital. Two months before Eduardo was diagnosed with leukemia, hisfather died of liver and lung cancer.RememberingInstinct told Eduardo he was sick. He initially went to see a dentistbecause his mouth would not stop bleeding when he brushed his teeth. The dentist98noticed a lot of bumps around Eduardo's neck, and told him to go see a physician.\"Then I was always tired; I was getting weak,\" Eduardo explained. Eduardo'sdentist told him it was his lymph nodes. That night, he told his mom what thedentist said. She took him to a physician the very next day, Friday, where bloodwork was done. The medical staff told him to come back on Monday.On Saturday, the physician's office staff called, and asked that he come inimmediately. Eduardo would have preferred waiting until the following Mondaybecause he had plans for the weekend. When asked why he preferred waiting,Eduardo replied: \"I'm just that type of person. I don't know. It wasn't reallybothering me. I had dealt with it up until that time, so another couple of days isn'treally going to matter.\"Emergency TransferHis mother prevailed, and she and Eduardo went back to the physician'soffice on Saturday. Eduardo remembers that the physician's office was on thewest side of the city. The physician was waiting for Eduardo, who was thentransferred immediately to the emergency room of a local hospital. \"They alreadyhad a room for us, and everything,\" he said. He knew something was wrong.Eduardo remembered being more \"upset\" than \"scared.\" \"I was a little bitupset that I was sick, and they ruined my time,\" he explained. Since the initialdiagnosis, Eduardo has lost more time to being sick with ALL, although heinitially went into remission with hopes for a full recovery.99Waking UpOne of the first procedures Eduardo underwent because of his disease wasa spinal tap. He remembered waking up during the procedure. He also recalledwaking up during a bone marrow aspiration. \"Yeah, it hurt,\" he said simply. Twomonths ago he was told cancer cells were found in his spinal fluid. Now Eduardois going through more chemotherapy until a suitable bone marrow donor can befound.He is also taking antibiotics for an infection that caused mucus buildup inthe form of blisters in his throat. Both the throat infection and the need for morechemotherapy have necessitated Eduardo's most recent return to the hospital.During this part of the conversation, a nurse walked into Eduardo'shospital room. He told her he was busy right then. \"Do you want me to comeback?\" she asked. \"Yes, please,\" he responded. She turned and left the room.Eduardo runs his own show.Confusing TalkTalking about his illness with others is not something Eduardo likes to do.He finds talking about his situation, especially with his mother and aunt,frustrating because of the complicated nature of medical issues involving cancer.\"I don't really like to talk with them about it. They don't reallyunderstand. My aunt doesn't really understand, and she will get confused. She100will start saying wrong things, and telling other people different,\" he explained.He also says that medical situations in general lend themselves to confusing talk.\"It's really confusing if you don't know anything about it. Just the wholeterminology and the ways things are called. And she [his aunt] has that Mexicanaccent and a lot of things sound [differently] like that,\" he described.When asked if he remembers the specific language used by the physicianto tell him he was sick, he distinctly recalled the specific phrase: \"Hey Eduardo,you have leukemia.\"The physician then started \"breaking it me I had ALL. It'sacute lympho . . . leukemia, \"I don't remember,\"he added.The Bottom LineAfter being given the initial diagnosis, Eduardo inquired little. \"I didn'treally ask any questions. I just wanted to know if I could be cured or not. BecauseI didn't really want to know what it was,\" he recalled.Eduardo was told there was a high rate of being cured. Then he explained:\"I just recently relapsed like 2 months ago.\" When I responded, \"I'm sorry,\"Eduardo replied: \"Me, too.\"Although he may not have wanted to know the full name of his diseasewhen initially diagnosed, Eduardo is now acutely aware of what is being done tohis body to try and keep him alive. He knows which intravenous bags are full of101fluid, which are full of chemotherapy drugs, and which contain morphine. He isfully cognizant of which bags are being hung for him at which times, and why. Hesays he is feeling \"pretty good\" today because he away,\" he explained.Giving BackEduardo's recent relapse derailed his plans to start college in the fall. He isa high school graduate who hopes to attend a local community college andsomeday become a nurse. Before becoming sick initially, he had set his sights onbeing a pediatrician. \"But now that I'm here [in the hospital], it takes longer to bea pediatrician,\" Eduardo explained.In the next couple of days, Eduardo hopes that he will be released from thehospital. When he gets home, he looks forward to watching cable television,channel surfing, and eating pizza or anything Italian. He loves rap music andrhythm'n'blues, or \"whatever sounds good.\"Eduardo converses easily about the movies he loves. Finding Nemo(\"Ellen's crazy,\" he said, referring to Ellen Degeneres; he loves her acting asDorie and speaking whale), A Beautiful Mind, Radio, and Titanic are among hisfavorites. He suggests that the film, A Beautiful Mind, is one you \"can't seetwice.\" When asked why, he replied: \"because you have already spoiled it\" byknowing the ending.102Half Full / Half EmptyEduardo said he is not certain as to the ending of his own story:Question:Do you have an idea of how this is all going to workout?Eduardo:Do I have an idea? No. I don't really know what is goingto happen.In the meantime, Eduardo continues to call things as he sees them. He focuses onwhat is real, as opposed to what may be imagined in a happenstance of hope. \"I'mnot real optimistic. I'm pessimistic. I focus on the negative. Yeah, I've alwaysbeen like that,\" he said.He wishes other people would do the same. In fact, he resents people whohand him an optimistic view of his situation, meaning that \"You are going to live,and everything is going to be all right,\" Eduardo said. He goes on to explain:\"You know how people tell you: You are going to be all right. God has to know,you don't really know what is going to happen to you?\" Eduardo hates that kindof talk.Eduardo takes a more practical, authentic approach to his way of thinking.\"I focus more on the reality part of it, that I may die. And my life may come to anend. It just happens. I'm sure other people who pray and say that they are going todo good, don't end up living. That's mostly how it is,\" he said.When asked specifically if he wished other people would talk to him usingan optimistic or pessimistic point of view he replied: \"pessimistic. I don't like it103when they tell me what they think, and they tell me what they think like theyknow what is going to happen. \"You know how people are like, 'Stay up,' sayingthat it is going to be alright. I always found it so corny. And now that I'm in theposition, it sounds even more corny,\" he added.Eduardo continued to emphasize his perspective. As he is talking I noticedhe changed his subject reference from they to you almost in midstream. Perhaps ashe continued his dialogue, he switched from talking to me, to talking directly toan imagined or remembered audience: \"You [as opposed to they] don't know whatmy future holds. Don't talk to me like you do,\" he declared angrily.Does he ever tell people directly not to talk to him in that way? \"No,\" hereplied, \"I just let them talk. I don't want to be rude or anything.\" He says peoplewho take an optimistic view of situations they are not directly living may thinkthey are saying the right thing, but \"They're just not.\"BoundariesAlthough Eduardo may hold strong feelings about how people should andshould not talk with him, he is quick to place tight boundaries around how muchtalking he himself does with others. Not only does he prefer to remain silent intalking about his illness with his mom (because she cries a lot) and his aunt, healso prefers not to talk about his illness or his feelings with his friends. He said: \"Iwouldn't talk with anybody about it because most people don't want to hear whatI have to say, because it's so negative.\"104His feelings are negative, they change very fast, and are often hard topinpoint. When asked to describe how he feels emotionally, Eduardo respondedwith honest clarity about an ambiguous and unsettling situation: \"I don't know.Right now I feel good. But when I feel sick, it's like I think I'm going to die, it'sjust . . . it's not a good feeling what you go through.\"Eduardo also has no interest in defining other people's stories, not evenother young people who have cancer just like him:Question:Is there anything you would say to parents of children,or young people, with cancer?Eduardo:Me personally? No. Because you are going to feel theway you feel about it. And nobody can make you feelanything. You don't know how other people feel. Imean, they can tell you, but at the end of the day you arestill going to feel what you feel. So it doesn't reallymatter what anybody says. You have that mindsetalready.Eduardo says it would be hard for other young people to learn from him. \"I'msure they are going through something worse than I'm going through. How do Italk to them? I don't want to say something that might hurt them, or that might getthem thinking negative. I don't want to affect them like that,\" he explained.HypocritesEven though Eduardo does not outwardly talk much about his illness withanyone, he does pray at times, albeit infrequently. \"Sometimes [I pray],\" he says.105\"But I didn't really pray before [he got sick], so I don't really want to startpraying now. I don't want to be one of those people,\" he added.Those people are people who \"just come to God when something badhappens,\" Eduardo explained. \"Hypocrites,\" he called them. He added: \"Youknow, like those people who only go to church on Easter and at Christmas time.\"Eduardo does not believe that you have to go to church all the time. \"Yeah, youdon't, but damn. Yeah, but don't try to preach if you only go 2 times a year,\" hecommented.Sense-MakingWhen Eduardo first got sick, he would lie in bed at night in the hospital.His mind would swirl. \"But I don't ask questions anymore, like 'Why?'Everything happens for a reason,\" he says.He understands people may be afraid to use the word death around himbecause \"deep down inside they might see that I may die. And they don't want tobring it up, which is perfectly fine with me. I don't really want to talk about it.I'm real to the fact that I may die. We've all got to die,\" he said.No longer does Eduardo feel a need to make full sense of his situation orbehave a certain way or even talk to others. He is periodically bothered by thereality that leukemia is \"just taking time out of my life that I can never get backbecause I would much rather be out there doing something else,\" he stated.106ThereWhen asked what the last few years have been like for him, Eduardoreplied simply: \"There.\"\"I'm still alive, so I guess they've been alright,\" he continued. Whenasked what could be worse than his present experiences, he replied: \"death andsuffering. I haven't really been suffering. I'm in a much better position than a lotof other kids that have been here.\"In the meantime, he continues to think about his life in terms of hisphilosophy that it is important to \"just be patient, and let it play out. I don't wantto rush it. Because it might not be what I want it to be.\"G. Unfiltered HarryTwenty-year-old Harry13 sits on his front porch on a cold and graySaturday afternoon in the fall of 2003. The afternoon in no way lends itself tobeing outside for any reason. It is damp, cold, and miserable. Not a singleindividual can be seen outside on the entire block. No birds are chirping, and thesky is void of color or character other than dreary. When I asked Harry if the coldmight bother him because of his illness, he shot me a look that crossed between 13 In this story, I have changed the names of the people I call \"Harry,\" \"Dr.Carter,\" \"Lucas,\" and \"Ted.\"107the inquisitive\u2014Have you always cynical\u2014Who me?What have I got to lose?Harry is an incredibly direct yet courteous young man. He is also fast insizing up his audience. When he realized the weather might be too miserable forsitting outside, he quickly asked if I wanted to do the interview inside. I said Iwanted to do the interview wherever he preferred. He sat down in a dirty plasticchair on his porch.Then he asked if his smoking would bother me. Again I responded in apositive yet deceptive way by saying \"Of course not,\" fully appreciating the factthat we are sitting on his front porch. Harry began talking by saying he did notsleep very much the night before because he and his girlfriend drove a familymember out of town to a camp for the autistic. The trip took almost all night. YetHarry is gracious in keeping his interview appointment and giving a total strangerpart of his time on a miserable Saturday afternoon. His story began. . . .Harry's DealHarry has lived with leukemia, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL),almost all his teenage years. He remembers first being diagnosed in the early partof 1998 when he was 14 years old. He knew something was wrong when thephysician [in a \"weird tone\" that Harry knew meant bad news] asked his father tostep outside the hospital room where Harry was undergoing tests. \"If he [thephysician] can't say it in front of me, it can't be good. We would have talked in108my room if it had been like, 'Oh, by the way, he's fine, send him back to schooltomorrow'; but it wasn't like that. They weren't fooling anybody,\" Harry said.At the time Harry had never heard of ALL, but he had a vision about whatthe future meant in terms of the diagnosis. \"I never really knew what leukemiawas. I just knew that you would be bald if you had it,\" he commented.Even after all these years, keeping track of his disease has not been easy. Itseems like a never-ending on-again, off-again saga. Harry battled leukemia, andfirst went bald, between 1998 and 2000. \"Or 2001, maybe. Either 2000 or 2001,\"he tried to remember precisely; \"2001, I think. And then I got over it, and it cameback in 2002,\" he added.Sugar-CoatingHarry is smart in a commonsensical, no-nonsense kind of way. He knowshis long-term prognosis is not good, despite constant talk from his medical staffthat he described as sugar-coating. \"They always tell me the good stuff. But that'swhat they've always done the whole time, and it's come back twice already, andmy chances are down to 50-50,\" he stated.Harry knows there is a major potential wrinkle in his long-term life plan.Although he realizes his physicians and nurses \"never tell me nothing bad, Ifigure when you've got a life-threatening illness, there's got to be some kind ofcatch somewhere, you know, and they are just trying to tell me that it's all good,\"he said.109With that in mind, Harry made a pact with his physician whom he admiresand relies on heavily. The pact is that if \"he [the physician] thought I wasn't goingto make it,\" then he would answer me honestly: \"What do you think from aprofessional point of view?\" Harry asked. \"And he will always tell me, 'Well, Ithink it looks good,' and all that,\" he added.Despite the pact, Harry understands things may not always be what theyare set up to be. He recognizes the complexities and ambiguities that oftengenerate changes in people's good intentions, like honoring a pact, whilecommunicating with individuals who may be at the end of their lives. \"But I thinkthat's what he [the physician] tells everybody. He's a doctor, that's what he'ssupposed to do - sugar-coat it all,\" Harry said.Harry also believes the entire medical staff is adept at sugar-coating hissituation in a genuine effort to make him feel better. \"They always tell me, well,the first time [Harry was diagnosed] they told me the same thing: 'It looks good,'and this and that,\" he said. \"And now that I'm back they tell me, 'We, we kind ofsaw it back then when we thought it was going to go away, but there was somestuff that showed otherwise,'\" he explained.Even during this latest time when the staff was sugar-coating the situation,Harry saw reality. \"You know, the fact that my blood count didn't drop, I neverneeded blood products. At the end, I was on like a year of just getting a shot in theleg, and seriously, like 4 or 5 times to try and drop my blood count, and it110wouldn't drop. And then finally they just had to, they reached the maximum theycould be giving me, so, which was like 4 or 5 times what they started with,\" heexplained. \"And it still wasn't even touching my count. So that was a bad signright there. All this time, my blood count is supposed to be lower, because thechemo is supposed to be affecting them [the bad cells], and it's not for like ayear,\" he recalled.When asked if he perceives sugar-coating as a form of lying, Harry saidno. \"No, because they tell me pretty much straight-forward. If they told me,'Well, look, you're going to live,' with a 50-50 chance, 'You're going to live,everything is going to be fine,' that's lying,\" he stated. But his physician told him,\"'Look, you have a real serious disease again. It's really bad that you got it asecond time.' That's not a really good sign at all. What that tells me is that themedicine is not working, which is very bad,\" Harry said. \"You know, so he tellsme the truth, that it's very bad,\" Harry distinguished.Flying SoloWhen Harry was first diagnosed at age 14, he participated to a much lesserdegree than now in conversations and decision-making regarding his care. As herecalled, \"the real important stuff when I was 14, they would usually talk that overwith my dad. They would kind of talk it over with him first, and then they wouldkind of team up on it, like my dad, and then Dr. Carter, and they would figure itout: 'OK, this is what we should tell him, and this is how we should tell him.'\"111Harry also remembered that the medical staff perceived him as having a greaterlaissez-faire attitude when he was younger, an incorrect assumption he is quick toadd. \"I guess that when I was 14, I was always different in their eyes. Like I wasalways happy-go-lucky, so it didn't really bother me, you know?\"But the staff was wrong, according to Harry. It did bother him to a greaterdegree than they realized. \"I mean, it did because it sucks, but other than that itwould have been fine. I guess they figure that now that I am more of an adult, Ican cope with the truth more than when I was younger,\" he added.Over the years, Harry has become adept at being more of a decision-makerand conversationalist in his own healthcare situations. For the past 2 years, he hasbeen going to the hospital by himself for his treatments. Since he has beenwrestling with leukemia for over 6 years, the routine of treatments, decisions, andmedicines has become second nature to Harry. \"Like most people, you go to thedoctor and you think about it a couple of times, OK, well I'm going to thephysician, and this is what I am going for,\" he explained.\"Me, it's like, OK, it's Monday. I'm going to the physician. [I] just get up,and go about my business, like you would get up and go to school or work. That'show I get up and go to the doctor. Not like every day, but basically, pretty close toit. And if I wasn't in the hospital for chemo, I was in there for pneumonia or lowblood counts, or, what's the word I'm looking for, Neutropenia, when you have112an unexplained fever and your blood counts are low,\" he described. \"Just like itwas my daily routine,\" he added.The NullHarry is quick to express his appreciation to his medical staff. At times, heseems to rely more on them than his family. Although it may frustrate him, heunderstands their reasoning for sugar-coating his situation by sometimes sayingvery little. \"If doesn't really have any [hard evidence], almostlike a criminal investigation, you don't go kick somebody up without any hardevidence,\" he stated. \"That's the way I'm thinking he's thinking about it. If he'snot real sure that it's going to come back, why get me worried? As if I don'tworry enough,\" Harry commented as he smiled wryly.Harry believes his physician takes the long-term approach of just lettingthings ride out for a while in an effort to help make life less of a worry for him.\"Because right now he says that everything is looking good. So, as long asnothing is showing up bad, there is really no reason for him to say nothing to meanyway,\" he theorized.CrapshootHarry's odds of long-term survival are continuing to worsen. They will notget better. At a minimum, he hopes, over time his body will stop the currentstatistical spiral downward from his initial diagnosis of 70-30 (70 percent cure/30113percent return rate) down to his current odds of 50-50. If his leukemia returns fora third time, however, his odds will drop even further to 30-70 (30 percent cure/70percent return rate). As his odds have worsened, so has the talk associated withhis disease, or at least the way in which Harry has heard that talk.\"It's kind of like the first time that everybody made it sound like a breeze,which I guess it was supposed to be, because I had a 70-30 chance, so I guess itwas supposed to be pretty simple. Since they made it out to be so simple, like, Iwent through it and once I finished my last treatment, in my mind, that was it, OKcool, I'm over it,\" Harry recalled. \"Live my life like a normal person now,\" hecommented.\"And then a year later, I got a job. I got everything going. I got carpayments, just like any adult would. And then it just comes back out of nowhere,and I'm like, Man, it came back, how does that happen? Wait a minute. It's notsupposed to do that. Seventy-thirty means it don't come back,\" he said. \"Kind ofjumps up and slaps you in the face,\" he said.Harry continued: \"And you realize that it does come back. My mentalityabout it is: I had a 70-30 that didn't work. Now I have a 50-50. If your luck ain'tgood enough for a 70-30, you really ain't going to make a 50-50. And then if itcomes back again, he [his physician] said that I drop down, he said to, probablyunder a 30-70,\" he reflected.114Harry is also extremely frustrated with the ambiguity that comes with 50-50 odds. \"Fifty-fifty doesn't tell me much. That's another thing. Not only do myodds suck, it doesn't really tell me anything. You know, if I had a 20 percent or a10 percent or a 30 percent even, then I would pretty much know what to lookforward to,\" he said. \"Now I'm kind of like, Well shit, what's going to happen,am I going to make it, or am I not going to make it? What's going on?\" hewondered.Yet he is resolute at times. \"If I go through my life thinking I'm going todie, then obviously, no matter how strong-willed you are, you're going to. It'sgoing to affect you. So I just try to [stay strong], until they tell me otherwise,\" hestated.FlexibleIf Harry's odds continue downward, and the ALL comes back again, heanticipates having some very tough decisions to make, like undergoing a bonemarrow transplant. The side effects of transplantation can be \"really horrible,\" hesaid, especially \"if I find out that I have a 1 percent chance.\" Side effects thatworry Harry include skin graphing, where \"your skin falls off,\" he described. Healso mentioned platelet dependency, where \"every day you have to go in there,and get infusions of platelets, like everything. So you don't even really have anormal life anyway,\" he said. \"What else?\" he asked himself. \"All kinds of stuff.115Yeah - like all kinds of stuff. Real bad horrible stuff that I had never heard of orthat I had never thought about because nobody had ever told me,\" he commented.\"But then again, that's their job because they aren't really supposed to talkme out of it [getting whatever additional treatment he may need should the cancerreturn],\" he added. \"They are supposed to try to talk me into any hope there is.You know what I mean? If there is the slightest bit of hope, they are supposed totalk me into going for it,\" he stated.Circular DepressionPeople marvel at Harry's ability to stay upbeat amidst his life situation.People say to him repeatedly, \"You're never depressed?\" He responds: \"And whatI always tell everybody is, I'm like, 'If I'm depressed, would that cure me?' Thatwould just give me a miserable life along with a deadly disease. Two wrongsdon't make a right. I'm not going to be able to fix it, so I might as well enjoy mylife the best I can,\" he said.He continued: \"I tell everybody that. I say it's not going to cure anythingby me being depressed or sad about it, or me dwelling on it. I might as well livemy life the best I can, and be as happy as I can while I'm here, you know, andappreciate these people who are with me,\" he stated. \"And if I'm depressed, youknow, what is that going to do? It's going to make my dad depressed. It's going tomake my girlfriend depressed. The kids are going to be depressed. My wholefamily, you know what I mean? My outlook, I think, that's the reason why they116have a good outlook on it, and . . . because I go through it with such ease, kind of,it's like, they don't really even get sad. They see how I'm strong, and they say,'Oh yeah, he's going to make it.' You know what I mean?\" he asked.Political IroniesHarry used the word weird a lot. He used it in terms of how he thinksabout life in general, including his own. He used it to describe how people talk tohim, around him, about him, and down to him. He especially thinks about the wayin which public policy and political decisions are made regarding research for hisdisease.\"I don't think they have enough research going on for leukemia,\" he said.\"Like I just heard on the news the other day, they spent, like a billion dollars orlike a hundred million dollars on figuring out about Alzheimer's. I figure, that'scool, I mean, I'm really glad that you are going to make a lot of older peopleremember stuff they forgot,\" he explained. \"But meanwhile, you got 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year olds dying every day. What about them?\" he asked.The weirdness and irony in Harry's mind is not just placed in the publicarena. It is also personal. He knows the 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year-old children who aredying and for whom he lobbies. \"And that's pretty hard to deal with too, because Iam pretty good friends with a patient who just passed away. Not so long ago, Iwent to his funeral, his viewing. I still hang out with his family, and so it's kind ofrough to deal with,\" he described. \"I've seen a 10-year-old boy get turned into an117only child from diseases like this. So it's kind of hard to deal with. Like, I'veseen, the same case with my friend, his parents now only have, they had 2 boys,now they only have 1 boy. You know, like, imagine, you grow up with just youand 1 sibling, and then all of a sudden, you're by yourself. They get taken fromyou. It's kind of weird,\" he explained.Smokin'Harry prays more now than he used to in an attempt to curb some of hisanger. When he was young and \"a lot more immature,\" he said, \"I kind of had thatattitude of God did it so I'm mad at Him.\" Now he thinks he is smarter. \"It's likewhen you're little, you know, and your parents don't let you get something. Well,telling them something, getting rude with them is not going to help you any. Youknow what I mean? So you might as well be nice,\" he philosophized. \"Now I'vegotten more into praying instead of being mad,\" he added.Yet he is particular about what he prays for at this time in his life.\"Usually I'm not a very selfish person at all, like if you knew me you would knowthat. So the [usual] way that I pray is like, to let me be healthy and to keep mearound. But if He doesn't, I know that there is a reason, that I probably don'tknow but that I will find out when I get up there, wherever I'm going. I'llprobably find it out,\" he said. \"But I just tell them that, you know, if He does endup taking me, just to make sure that my family is OK,\" he explained.118In the meantime, he is still wondering about his future in terms of wherehe will end up. \"Yeah, show me,\" he challenges. \"Who can tell me, 'Oh, I'vebeen there; Heaven's the coolest place around, you know, it's happening!'Nobody can tell you that,\" he says.\"All you know is that there's a hundred old books of people who used toget all high off something, and write down stuff. That's all it is,\" he said, referringto books and philosophies about Heaven as described in the Bible. \"Who's to tellyou what those people were on back then? You know? They were on acid orsomething. Yeah, there's this guy, he's in the sky, I've seen him,\" he ponders.Harry also wonders about Hell, especially since he says he has made some\"bad choices\" in his life. \"They can't let everybody in [referring to Heaven], sothere's got to be some he explained. \"Everybody always tellsme, 'All you've got to do is ask for forgiveness for any bad things you've everdone, and you'll get right in.' If it were that easy, Hell would go out of business.The devil would get out and become an angel again,\" he argued.Harry suggested many of us make our own Hell on earth. \"The way peoplelive their life is a big part of it. Like I said, a lot of people would feel like this isHell, you know\u2014the worst, going through a real bad disease,\" he stated. [But] \"Imake the best of it. I still got the people I love\u2014you know what I mean? Knockon wood. There's wood laying around here somewhere,\" he said searching.119Quality of LifeOf all the phrases used in a cancer hospital with seriously ill young people,the one Harry hates the most is quality of life. \"I don't like that term, it makes mesound like a used car,\" Harry explained. \"Quality of life. That means my resalevalue isn't too much, kind of, you know?\" he explained.He remembered the phrase was used repeatedly, especially when he wasyounger. \"I don't remember how they used it, but I remember them using theterm, quality of life,\" he said. \"What does that mean, my life sucks, what are youtrying to say? What does that mean, my life is not worth living? Fill me in.Explain it to me slower. I'm 14 now. Come on now,\" he challenged.He continued: \"I don't know, it just gets to me. It's nothing fancy, but to a5-year-old or a 14-year-old, they might think, Well, what is that? And a lot oftime when they used to tell me that, I used to just skip right over it and not thinkabout it. I would just go on about my thing because I didn't understand it,\" headded.The Perfect PlaceHarry is suspicious, if not cynical, about death. He is suspicious about thenotion of Heaven as an end-all nirvana. The hospice chaplains reminded him thatGod is not fair, and that life is not fair. They asked him to think about things inways that are not always easy for him, like \"everything happens for a reason, and120that in the Bible it says that everybody is supposed to go through trials andtribulation and suffering,\" he explained. He is not certain about the logic orcomfort that comes from hearing such words.He is also still puzzled about the loss of life at such a young age.Ironically, he is not referring to himself, although he was only 14 when firstdiagnosed, but rather to those much younger children with cancer whosesituations seem to crawl under his skin, given their injustices and insanities.One day the hospice chaplain asked Harry how he knew that a 5-year-oldpassing away was such a bad thing. \"[This] kind of struck me,\" Harry replied. \"Itkind of upset me at first, but then she [the chaplain] went on explaining by saying:'How do you know that God's not actually God, because, at 5 years old, God'staken them to Heaven? You know he's not going to get judged or anything, he'sjust going to go straight up to Heaven.' Even if he did get judged, it is obviouswhere he would go, because he was the sweetest boy, and the chaplain said, 'Youknow he's going to go to Heaven because he's 5 years old,'\" Harry recalled.The hospice chaplain challenged Harry to think about death in a differentway. Harry remembered the chaplain asking him: \"How do you know that God isnot actually saving him from something bad going on in his life?\" The questioncertainly made Harry think. In fact, Harry thinks the only plausible explanationfor why young children die from illnesses like his is maybe because they arebeing saved from something bad that was going to happen. \"You never know121what would have happened in his [a young child's] life, if he would have lived,\"he theorized.Yet he still remains unsure. \"See, that's the thing too. I kind of have mixedfeelings about it. I've gone through a lot of rough stuff in my life, the leukemia, abunch of other stuff, you know, I've had a pretty rough life,\" Harry explained.\"And, you know, everybody says that 'Oh, Heaven is the perfect place, it'sparadise,' this and that. That's probably true, but to me, it's not. I don't think thatit's the perfect place. Just because of the fact that, it may be the perfect place inthe end, but to me, even though I have been through so much, this is the perfectplace for me. I love my family, I love my environment, I love the people aroundme,\" he said.ChoicesHarry firmly believes cancer patients initially have few choices. They arebound by a practical reality suggesting a need to reach out and grab hold ofwhatever treatment is offered to them. He thinks this is especially true of theyounger cancer patients whose treatment decisions are being made by theirparents. \"They don't have no choice,\" he said.In that process, those younger patients and their parents inspire the 20-year-old Harry. \"There's nothing amazing about me,\" he suggested. \"Just to beable to go through it is amazing,\" he said. \"Those patients down there [in thepalliative care center area for the younger patients], they inspire me. I don't think122I would have made it all through my treatment if it wasn't for seeing all thoselittle kids and stuff,\" he added.Being a role model to the younger patients is something that has alwaysbeen important to Harry, although he is not sure he is particularly up for thechallenge. \"When I was in-patient, I kind of felt that I had to be a role model forthose kids. You know what I mean? Granted, I never came out of my roombecause I was too busy throwing up, but I always felt, just being there, you know,they see an older person being there, they feel like, Man, look at him, he's older. Iwant to be older, too. They kind of look at it, and they try and be stronger,because they see somebody older in there, and they want to be older. They wantto be my age someday,\" he explained.Harry feels the same about his own family. Harry's father is his rolemodel. \"That's kind of what keeps me going too, because, I see my dad, and Iwant to be a grandfather one day. I want to go through all that stuff,\" he added.LucasAlmost every example of a young cancer patient Harry mentionedspecifically referred to a 5-year-old boy. That little 5-year-old boy Harry thinksabout almost all the time is his friend, Lucas. Harry worships Lucas. Lucas isHarry's role model. The only time in a several-hour interview that Harry cameeven close to crying was when he talked about Lucas. Cancer killed little Lucas.123Harry talked to one of the hospice chaplains about Lucas in his ongoingattempts to make sense of things. \"It was more of a religious talk than anythingelse. I told her [the chaplain]: 'I don't seem to understand.' I was like, 'You hearabout on the news about people robbing banks and stuff, they get shot 3 or 4 timesin the head, and they still live, and get out of jail a year later,'\" he wonders. \"Andyou've got the sweetest little boy I've ever met in my whole life\u20145-year-old boy,sweetest little boy you'll ever meet in your life,\" he said again. He continued: \"Heis so sweet. And he just dies. You know what I mean? I just don't think it's fair,\"Harry stated sadly.Harry is firmly convinced Lucas \"got gypped.\" \"You know, all the funstuff that we take for granted, he never got a chance to do. He never got a chanceto just, make his own decisions. You know? You wake up on your day off orsomething and you are like, Where am I going to go today, what am I going todo? Nobody's telling you what to do because you are not 5 years old,\" hecommented. \"You just go about your day, wherever you want to go, you go. Ifyou want to get in your car right now and drive to Canada, you'll do it, justbecause you want to. And he never got to drive a car. Have a girlfriend. Go tohigh school. Actually have a group of friends that he went out and had fun with.He never got to do nothing,\" he lamented.Tears well up in his eyes for the first time. They glisten beyond the smokefrom his cigarette. He looks away, and shifts his body forward in the patio chair,124as if to push the tears back into his face. Harry has not cried once before\u2014noteven when talking about the prospects of his own death.Blessed AssuranceHarry rhetorically pushes the envelope. He does not mince words. He islike the movie character Dirty Harry. He tells it like it is. You keep waiting forhim to snarl: \"Make my day.\" He is also direct in saying what he needs. He thinkscancer patients like himself, especially those who are younger, need to hear \"morereassurance from the physician that everything is going to be fine,\" he said. Andyet he does not say in particular what that reassurance might entail. Does it meanbeing cured, living a long time, being less sick today than tomorrow, finding asuitable bone marrow donor? Harry does not elaborate.Harry suggests reassurance is the most important message needing to beconveyed to people who are possibly staring at the end of their lives. He is alsoespecially adamant that such reassurances need to be conveyed over and overagain to younger patients with life-threatening illnesses.Rated PG-13In thinking about how to tell people they have cancer, Harry pontificated:\"I think, as you get older, unless it's a baby or somebody really, really young whoreally doesn't know much, I think the older you get, the easier it would probablybe to tell somebody,\" he said. \"I think when you are 5, it's real hard to.\"125He continued: \"But then again, when you're older, you can tell a 5-year-old boyhe has cancer, and he's like, 'OK.'\" Then Harry paused, as if to wonder about thetheory that ignorance is bliss.\"He [a 5-year-old patient] doesn't know what he's in for. But if you breakit down for him, and tell him, 'Look, you have this disease called cancer. It'sprobably going to end up killing you. But if it doesn't kill you, you are going towish it did because you are just going to end up spending year after year throwingup in the hospital.' But other than that, I don't think that a 5-year-old can reallyunderstand what's going on,\" he said. \"You know what I mean?\"He continued: \"And then it would be more of a thing, Well, let me tell himso that at least he knows. He may not understand exactly, and then once he startsgoing through treatment, he starts feeling weird and stuff. Then try to be his bestfriend. Try to talk to him and be real friendly with him so he trusts you. And justbe straight-forward with him,\" he added.Harry also believes delivery is important. Pauses are a cuing factor, alongwith his defined weird tones from the physicians, although he cannot fullydescribe what qualifies as a weird tone. \"Just the way he [his physician] said it[that Harry's cancer had returned], you could tell bad news was coming,\" Harryremembered. He gives an example: 'Well, Harry, I would like to tell you that, uh[pause].' \"You know, when somebody keeps pausing, it's not a good thing that'shappening,\" Harry explained.126RerunsWhen he found out his cancer had returned after experiencing severeheadaches at work, Harry recalled receiving the news: \"They looked at my blood,and told me I had it again. And they go, 'OK, well, we've got a room saved foryou on the in-patient side, and we need you to start tonight.'\"Harry protested. \"The disease needs me to start tonight on chemo? Well,the disease can wait until tomorrow. That doesn't meet up with my schedule. Idon't feel like starting tonight. I'm not going to live my life depending on what Ineed to do to beat that disease. It's not going to work,\" he told the medical staffand his family, many of them crying softly. \"Either the disease is going to workmy way, or it is just not going to work, and that's just not the way it was meant tobe,\" he explained. \"I told him [his physician] that I wanted to go home and thinkabout it. I was like, 'I don't even know if I want to go through this again,'\" headded.Harry went home that night for time to \"count his blessings\" and \"see whyI'm going to put myself through all of that trouble again,\" he said. Later that nighthe went out and partied with friends. In the end, he decided to start treatmentsagain largely on the advice of his physician and the nursing staff at the cancerhospital. \"I've been going there so long, I trust them. If Dr. Carter tells me there isnothing wrong, then nothing's wrong. If Ted [one of his favorite oncology nurses]tells me he thinks that I'm going to get cured, then that's what I'm going to127believe. They've just built up that trust with me. You know, everybody downthere has. They've made it to where, as far as I know, they've never just lied tomy face. They've sugar-coated stuff in the past like I said, but, that's their job,they're supposed to do that,\" he mentioned.Straight-forward vs. Cut-throatHarry also distinguishes between talking in a straight-forward manner, asopposed to a cut-throat manner, to use his words. \"Cut-throat? No. Not to a 5-year-old. I was just saying . . . that's what you would have to say for them tounderstand exactly what they are going to go through. Because you tell a 5-year-old boy that he has cancer, you've got ALL\u2014leukemia\u2014he's going to look atyou like, Is that good? Do I get some candy or a toy? They're not going tounderstand exactly what that is,\" he explained.\"But you tell a 20-year-old, you got cancer, they are like, 'Aw, shit.' Youknow what I mean? They are like, 'Damn,'\" he said.When Harry was first told he had cancer at age 14, he said he just \"kind oflaughed about it. It wasn't serious to me, but then again, I didn't really know whatI was in for either. And that's one thing I think: Cancer really sucks. Because,most diseases and stuff, you know how to get rid of them. You take antibiotics orsomething that makes you feel better,\" he said. \"Because usually you have adisease that medicine makes you feel better,\" he added.128\"Well, with cancer, you've got a disease that makes you feel like crud, andthey give you something that makes you feel even worse\u2014a lot worse. That'skind of how I think you get ripped off. Any other thing, your treatment makes youfeel better. This thing, your treatment just, it's kind of like, in a fight, theleukemia knocks you on the ground, and then the chemo just kind of gives youthose last few kicks while you're laying there.\"As the interview drew to a close, Harry stubbed out the last of manycigarettes. The cold and damp air seemed worse now because it was lateafternoon. The sky remained dark.Harry thinks again of little Lucas, his role model. \"To be honest, heinspired me more than I inspired him, I think. He went through [it], then herelapsed, too, so he went through what I went through too, if not worse. I think hereally went through worse honestly. Actually, I know he went through a lotworse,\" he clarified. \"How am I going to be scared or not willing to do somethingthat a 5-year-old boy does? That's another reason that I did it too [begantreatments again]. I'm figuring, if these children can go through it without [a sayso], then so can I\u2014they don't have the say so of whether they want to or not, theyare made to go through it. It's kind of like when you are in the army, you stick upfor your army. When you're a police officer, you stick up for other police officers.If there are little kids dying everyday, and they went through everything theycould, and they still pass away, you never know, I would hate to give up on it, and129then find out, when I get to Heaven or whatever, that if I didn't give up on it, Iwould have lived\u2014because to me that would have made me feel like that small.Because I don't think that [it] would be right for somebody my age to give upsuch a wonderful opportunity to continue their life, when there are people who getthat life taken from them, they have no choice. And I figure that, I think, that's themost horrible thing I could do, from my position, is just give up an opportunitythat I'm given,\" he commented.\"As far as now, even if I do die, I still have time, I would at least probablysay a year or two. Worst-case scenario, you know, I'm open,\" he pondered. Withthat, he proceeded to introduce me to his girlfriend's four young children whocame onto the porch, whom he views as his own. \"You could imagine what itwould be like to lose a father\u2014especially at a young age,\" he said, thinking of hisown family.For more than 2 solid hours, this young man, who knew at age 14 hewould periodically be bald and sick because of leukemia, has told the story of hislife for the last 6 years. The good, the bad, and the ugly. He has spoken with theutmost candor. He has asked many tough questions and challenged manyperceptions that come with few clear answers.Many of Harry's viewpoints, feelings, and pontifications are mixed andcontradictory. Without a doubt, they are all frank and raw. He is incrediblygenerous in giving of his time in order to help other people through the telling of130his own story. There is a sense in which he seems to be wondering why he is stillalive, and his dear 5-year-old friend, little Lucas, is dead.For now, he lives with an internal view of abundance and gratefulness.\"For the most part, my suffering has come from the chemo and stuff, you knowwhat I mean? And that just has to do with me, and like I said, I'm not a selfishperson. So if that's what I have to look forward to, my pain and suffering duringlife, then I'll take it with a grain of salt, and just be thankful that my family isOK,\" he said. \"Because, that's the only thing I'm worried about is, the people Ilove. I'm pretty strong-willed, too. I can pretty much go through anything. I cango through 6 years of this stuff, you know. I don't think there's anything out thereI can't do,\" he said convincingly.In the meantime, he will make the most of every single day that comes hisway. \"And if God does take me young, then I enjoyed what I had. That's just theway it is,\" Harry said.Driving back from the interview I was reminded for some reason of thesong from \"Carousel\" that comedian Jerry Lewis sings at the end of each annualMuscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) fundraising telethon. It begins:When you walk through a storm, hold your head up highAnd don't be afraid of the dark.14 14 Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein, lyric from \"You'll NeverWalk Alone,\" in the 1945 musical Carousel.131Perhaps from Harry, the message is somewhat similar: When you walk through astorm, tell it like it is.Make my day: Unfiltered Harry.H. WaitingIn the butterfly room of a children's hospital cancer ward, Corazon15 sitswaiting and watching. She sits alone in the small living room adjacent to her son'shospital bed. Her son, 6-year-old Marcelo, fidgets in the bed nearby, seeminglywatching cartoons. There is no sound coming from his television.Marcelo is extremely restless. His eyes, although sunk deep back into hisface, are open. He stares at you piercingly and hauntingly when you smile and sayhello. He does not smile back.Both eyes are blackened from internal bleeding. His lips are chapped andthe skin is cracked and torn. He does not smile, but groans periodically at lowtones. His mother leans down closer to his body, and softly asks her mijito (son) ifhe is hurting. He says no, yet continues to squirm in bed. With his emaciated legs,he tosses his white bed sheet on and off his rail-thin body. He is bleeding from thelips, along with many other parts of his body, his medical staff explains later. Hecontinues to moan. 15 In this story, I have changed the names of the people I call \"Corazon,\"\"Marcelo,\" and \"Manuel.\"132At age 6, time is slipping away for Marcelo. Perhaps his groans suggest heis aware of the intensity and brevity of his situation. Maybe he is angry. Orperhaps he is in pain, despite what he has said to his mother and the morphinedrip that hangs nearby\u2014perhaps all of the above.To myself I wonder if the presence of a third unknown party in the room,despite Corazon's approval, is making a bad situation worse. When I offer toleave, Corazon quietly responds, \"It's OK.\" She wants to tell her story and givevoice to her dying son who is too ill to talk.The Butterfly RoomMany hospice programs and pediatric cancer centers have what are calledbutterfly rooms like the one in which Marcelo is staying. The rooms representareas for transitioning from this life to the next, much like the morphing of acocoon into a butterfly.Butterfly rooms are usually decorated in bright yet soothing colors, as isthe case with the rooms in which Corazon and Marcelo are located. Butterflyrooms are usually much larger than traditional hospital rooms, and are designed toaccommodate entire families with separate living areas, kitchenettes, pull-outcouches, and similar other items. To say that someone is in the butterfly roomusually means that person is getting ready to die.On this particular Friday afternoon, Corazon and Marcelo are alone in thebutterfly room. No family members are huddled nearby. The 2 sections of the133butterfly room are cheerful and bright. Yet everything in the room is quiet andseems to move at a slow pace. Marcelo's groans are quiet. The television noise isdrone-like. Corazon speaks quietly. Medical staff personnel come and go, softlyand unobtrusively. Corazon sits, waits, and watches while she tells her story.A Mother's VigilCorazon and Marcelo, whom she watches from across the room, are bothbeautiful. Their eyes are dark, expressive, and sad. They both have dark hair, andare extremely youthful despite the weariness showing on their faces.Corazon sits by herself in the living area of the butterfly room. Like herson, she is watching television with the sound barely on. She is watching asegment from Oprah in which a husband in Florida is appealing to a court to endhis suffering wife's life. Corazon says the show takes her mind off of Marcelo'ssituation. At the risk of placing unintended judgment about a situation in Florida Iknow little about, I am struck by the irony in which a young mother sits helplesslyalone watching a television show about a person actively pursing death for aloved one, while her son lays dying in the next room. Her conversation with meover the next hour suggests she would do anything to make things different.Her First BornMarcelo is Corazon's first-born child. As if life were not challengingenough with Marcelo's situation, Corazon's other younger son has severe autism.134Corazon distinctly remembers the day in the fall of 2001 when she wastold Marcelo had cancer. She was alone at the time. \"It wasn't what I wasexpecting\u2014being your first-born. He was never sick at the time. [It was] veryscary,\" she explained. Her eyes filled with tears, but she does not make a sound.Marcelo has lived for the past 2 years with a form of cancer calledNeuroblastoma. The National Cancer Institute and CancerIndex describeNeuroblastoma as one of the most common solid tumors of early childhood. Itcustomarily is found in babies or young children, with two-thirds of the casesoccurring in children younger than 5 years of age. The disease usually originatesin some area of the nervous tissue, the most common site being the abdomen. Itcan also be found in the chest, neck, pelvis, and other body areas.16Approximately 70 percent of all patients with the disease have metastatic(or spreading) disease at diagnosis. For children of any age whose evidence of thedisease is localized as opposed to spreading, and for infants younger than 1 yearof age with advanced illness, there is a high likelihood of long-term survival.However, survival chances for older children with advanced-stage Neuroblastomaare significantly decreased despite intensive therapy. As an example, the NationalCancer Institute reports a two-year survival rate of only approximately 20 percentin older children with end stages of the disease. 16Children's Cancer Web (2003, Jan. 11). Neuroblastoma. Retrieved Jan.10, 2004, from http://www.cancerindex.org/ccw/guide2n.htm.135Little Words, Big ProblemsWhen physicians initially told Corazon that Marcelo had Neuroblastoma,they used what she described as \"little words,\" the words mass and tumor. Theydid not initially use the word Neuroblastoma. \"They showed me how Marcelo had a tumor the size of two fists in hisabdomen.\" She holds up her fists to show the large size. \"He's a very petite littleboy,\" she said. The physician explained to Corazon that the mass in Marcelo'sstomach was not supposed to be there.Telling DadMuch is written about the strong matriarchal role of women in theHispanic culture. Such seems to be the case in this family. Corazon's husband,Marcelo's father, was working at the time the news about Marcelo was delivered.One of the hardest parts of the initial ordeal for Corazon was telling her husbandabout their son. \"That was hard because he lost his mom like a year and a halfbefore to cancer,\" she said softly. She looked away and down at her lap, as if tohide extremely painful memories. There also seemed to be an unstated projectionfrom her that somehow she had let her family down because of the multipledeaths.At first, Corazon and her husband asked few, if any, questions. \"You kindof just stay stunned, in shock, I guess. And then you kind of say, 'Well, what136should we do, what is there to do?' And then they sit down with you, and tell you,these are your chances. And this is what is going to take place. He will get sickfrom chemo. They are very straight-forward with you,\" she recalled.Reality TimeCorazon appreciated the candor of the medical staff, despite the pain ofthe message. \"We had a conference, and we asked 'What are his possibilities ofgetting better?' And you know, it was told to us, 10 to 20 percent, that he might,\"she stated. \"That's a very small amount,\" she added.She continued: \"We had some hope, but I think deep inside you are kindof like, Oh, OK\u2014kind of trying to get the reality in there,\" she said. \"But it takestime,\" she remembered.The initial treatments were the hardest on everyone, especially Marceloand Corazon. \"The first time it's really bad, because by the second day, he has thenausea\u2014and then to see him, because he's so petite. The first session, becauseyou hear of the nausea and you are like, Oh, he didn't get it the first day. But thenthe second day, 'I'm going to throw up,'\" Corazon recalled Marcelo saying.By the second session, Marcelo began losing his hair. \"It was on hispillow, and he was kind of like, 'Why is my hair falling out?' I'm like, 'Well, youknow. . . ,'\" she added, without finishing the sentence.One of the hardest parts of Marcelo's journey over these past 2 years forhis mom is watching his body physically waste away. Marcelo has always been137small. At age 4, before he became ill, he already weighed approximately 10pounds less than national parenting statistics suggest an average 4-year-oldweighs.17 He continues to drop well beyond the national averages on a daily basis.In fact, Marcelo's frame unfortunately looks like that of a little old man.The DevilAnother of the biggest challenges faced by Corazon relates to what to sayto her son. While she appreciates the directness of the medical staff, she struggleswith putting reality into words for Marcelo. As conversations have taken placeover these past 2 years, Marcelo has created his own visual images of what he isbeing told.\"And that's the other thing, explaining to him what is going on,\" she said.Her eyes filled up with tears that she quickly wiped away. She is careful not tomake a sound other than the low tones of her voice.\"He wasn't in the room,\" when she was told he had cancer, she explained.\"I had to tell him later, and it's hard to explain. You know, he turned 5 [justrecently] so, to a 5-year-old, to tell him, 'You have cancer.' And he's like,'What's that, is that what's making me puke?'\" she recalled Marcelo as saying.Corazon explained to Marcelo: \"I told him, there's little rocks in yourbody, baby, and they are in different places. And they are not supposed to be 17BabyBag.com (2004, n.d.). Height and weight averages for children.Retrieved Jan. 10, 2004, from www.babybag.com/index.htm.138there. It's called cancer,\" she stated. \"And he himself said: 'It seems like thedevil.' And I never . . . . We're Catholic, it's mostly like, we haven't gone [tochurch] in a long time because of Manual [her young son with autism]. You can'ttake an autistic little boy to church on Sundays. It's like one parent has to watchhim. You know, so it's very hard. So, where did he [Marcelo] get that,\" sheshrugs with a smile, \"'It's like the devil'?\" she repeated with wonder. With that,she asked to pause the interview in order to get Marcelo some chocolate. Hecontinued to groan, but said he needed nothing.DisinfectantsCorazon has had a lot on her plate for many years. At age 29, she seemedan extremely strong and caring individual. When she was a small child, she tookcare of her parents, both of whom were ill. Her mother later became afflicted withcirrhosis of the liver, although ironically she recalled, \"My dad drank, which wasodd.\"The last few years of her life have been extremely challenging. The springof 2001 was when Manuel was diagnosed with severe autism. Later that sameyear, Marcelo was diagnosed with cancer. In the spring of the following year,Corazon's mother became acutely ill at age 55 and in need of liver and kidneytransplants. She eventually survived. During her mother's illness, the petiteCorazon cared for the incontinent woman, \"a big woman, just big everywhere,\" inher home, along with her two boys, one with autism and the other, cancer.139The scene was not pretty, nor sanitary, an important medical element inthe environmental lives of struggling cancer patients. \"I was a Clorox and Lysolfreak; it was very hard,\" Corazon recalled. Corazon is also currently raising hersister's oldest daughter who is about the same age as Marcelo.Lady God / Hungry GodThroughout his illness, Marcelo has not talked very much, although he canbe talkative at times. He has only once asked about the devil, yet he does continueto wonder about many things. He wonders if the female hospice chaplain is the\"Lady God\"? His mom tells him that although she isn't God, she is the hospicechaplain and does know God. That seems to have pleased Marcelo, as Corazonrecalled.Corazon also recalled that the more the hospice chaplain would visit herson, the more Marcelo would ask about God, and what God was doing. Corazononce told Marcelo that God was in him. \"Again I ran into that problem where Iam not the expert, so, you know, I'll kind of say what I think is right,\" sheexplained. Such dialogue resulted in interesting questions from Marcelo.Marcelo asked his mom if she thought God was in his stomach. \"Do youthink He's eating my hamburger?\" he used to say. Corazon remembered: \"He'llsay, 'I think He drank my punch because I'm thirsty again.' Just things like that.He would say, 'Well, he's probably thirsty. He could take a drink in my stomach,that's OK.'\"140Attitude: Hear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak No EvilOne of the reasons Corazon believes her son prefers not to talk very muchis because he is shy around strangers. She says that over time he has changed hisperspective on the medical personnel who deliver his chemotherapy. \"When wefirst started chemotherapy, he was taking to everybody. But then he found out thatwhen he's in the hospital, he gets sick with his chemo. So I guess in his mind,these people are making him sick, and they are talking to [him].\" So I'm not goingto talk to them, she thinks Marcelo might be thinking.She continued: \"He told me at home: 'They want to hear me talk, and I'mnot going to talk to them,'\" she stated. Corazon recognizes her son has what shedescribes as attitude. \"So, when we would come here [to the hospital], he wouldjust close his lips,\" she described. When the medical staff asked him something,Marcelo would not respond. \"He would say, 'I don't want them to hear me talk.They're not going to hear my voice.' So he had that attitude. . . . He had that thingwhere he wasn't going to talk to anybody,\" she added.Keeping His WordCorazon and her son seem to worship each other. From across the width ofthe butterfly room, they visually connect with each other, with few words everbeing exchanged. Corazon is extremely cautious about how she behaves in frontof Marcelo.141\"He might have gotten a little bit [of that attitude] from me, but you know,he was a very happy-go-lucky kind of guy,\" she recalled. Corazon thinks part ofMarcelo's attitude that resulted in him telling her he would not talk, now meansthat sometimes he only talks to the medical staff when she is not in the room. \"Idon't know if he's like, I already told my mom I'm not talking, so I've got to keepmy honor,\" she conjectured. \"Even with the nurses, he would talk to some ofthem, but as soon as I walked in, he wouldn't talk,\" she suggested.A Straight FaceMarcelo's physical cancer pain is bad. He requires a great deal ofmorphine to minimize the discomfort. Sometimes his groans suggest themorphine is not working, as he continues to thrash in his bed.Marcelo's emotional discomfort is always very bad when he sees hismother cry. \"Marcelo doesn't want me to cry. If he hears me, he just getshysterical,\" Corazon explained. \"He get mad, and he starts to cry, and he says,'Stop crying!' He loses it; he just loses it. So, it's like, it's hard because I have tokeep that straight face with him,\" she commented. \"Sometimes I just can't,\" sheadded quietly, with tears filling her eyes. She looks down and away fromMarcelo.142What If the Devil Wins, Mommy?Marcelo has told his mother he thinks both God and the devil are in hisstomach, and that God is fighting the devil, which is the cancer. At times he asksher: \"What happens if the devil wins?\" She tells him that \"the cancer will win,and that you are probably going to die and go to Heaven.\"Marcelo has worried not only about his own future, but also the otherchildren he knows who have cancer like him. Corazon is convinced that at timesher son has pretended to be asleep in the hospital room while listening to thenurses and physicians, and other parents around him. Later he would ask his momabout what he had heard, \"Like, all these kids have cancer, are all of them goingto die?\"Maybe TomorrowCorazon does not hesitate to use the word death in front of Marcelo if shethinks straight talk is in order. Humor is important within the family in thatsometimes family members will tell Marcelo that even after he gets to Heaven, hecan come back to earth and turn off the television sets so that no one will be ableto see his or her favorite shows. \"He'll say [to his cousin] 'I'm going to go takeout the cables when you are watching Kim Possible [a television show]. Yeah,I'm going to take them all out, and you're not going to be able to see it,'\" hismom recalled.143Sometimes Marcelo directly asks Corazon, \"Mommy, am I going toHeaven?\" He will ask her to explain once again what is Heaven. Then the 6-year-old will respond: \"Well, I don't want to go to Heaven right now. Maybetomorrow.\"EpilogueAfter this interview was conducted, Marcelo unexpectedly regainedenough strength to leave the butterfly room, and return home with his mom. Helived several more tomorrows, and died a month later.I. It HappensTrudy18 is a 15-year-old teenager with long blonde hair who sits in anInternational House of Pancakes booth next to her mom, Kathy. The restaurant isbusy with patrons on a Saturday morning right before Thanksgiving.Trudy's parents are divorced. Three weeks before the interview, Trudycame back to live with her mother after spending 10 months living with herfather.The 15-year-old looks like a normal teenager who could easily be a highschool homecoming queen or head cheerleader. At this moment in her life, Trudy 18 In this story, I have changed the names of the people I call \"Trudy,\"\"Kathy,\" \"Michele,\" and \"Dr. Dixon.\"144is busy pushing a single order of hash browns around on her plate, awaiting thearrival of catsup. Her mom tells me she cannot eat hash browns without catsup.Trudy tells me she cannot even take a single bite before receiving the condiment.We all wait.After the catsup arrived, Trudy began eating. Together Kathy and Trudytold me their story.CFTrudy is the first to tell you she battles Cystic Fibrosis (CF) on a dailybasis. The disease \"has to do with your lungs and pancreas,\" she explained. Withthe exception of the end of an intravenous needle holder poking through herbandaged forearm, Trudy appeared the picture of good health. Such is not thecase.Trudy was first diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis at age 8 weeks. One inevery 3,900 babies in the United States is born with CF, considered one of themost common fatal genetic disorders in the country.19 Approximately 30,000American children and young adults have the disease. It is an incurable hereditarydisorder in which the body secretes abnormally thick, sticky mucus clogging the 19 Encarta Encyclopedia. (2004, n.d.). Cystic Fibrosis: Multimedia.Retrieved Jan. 11, 2004, fromhttp://www.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567047/Cystic_Fibrosis.html.145pancreas and the lungs. This secretion leads to breathing and digestive problems,infection, and untimely death.Thirty years ago Cystic Fibrosis killed most babies before they reachedearly childhood. Despite medical advancements, the disease remains incurable.However, the long-term outlook has improved over time. Now more than 60percent of babies born with the disease reach adulthood. The journey, however, isnot without hardships and struggles.Early TroubleTrudy's pediatrician knew something was wrong, especially given the factthat Trudy was always breathing heavily and frequently vomited right after eating.At age 6 weeks she was referred to a pulmonary specialist.Sweating and PattingConfirming a Cystic Fibrosis diagnosis for certain involves conducting asweat test. Sweat tests measure the amount of salt in a person's body. Kathyremembered the day well. \"They wanted to sweat test her [Trudy] just to makesure that it wasn't CF. She [the physician] knew something was wrong because ofthe weight gain, the vomiting, and the chronic respiratory problems. But shedidn't, of course, suspect CF,\" Trudy's mom recalled.\"They did a sweat test on her, which was like a watch, a little watch theyput on her arm. And it gathered sweat. CF patients have high doses of sodium in146their system. It was like a 20-minute test. Then we had the results later that day,\"she said. \"After she [the physician] got the positive back on the test, they called usback in, and they told her father and me. They said she had CF because she had ahigh dose of sodium in her system,\" she recalled.Kathy vividly remembered being told Trudy's life span would be limitedbecause of CF. \"She [the physician] had told us at that time that they expected thelife span to be under 20 years. Ten years before that, it wasn't more thanchildhood,\" she stated. \"It took a while for the information to soak in. She [thepulmonary specialist] immediately hospitalized her, and kept her for about aweek. And they treated her for her symptoms,\" she recalled. \"All they could do atthat time was treat the symptoms, you know, get the mucus out of her lungs,\" sheadded.\"At that time, we started on a regiment of nebulized [breathing]treatments, and patting her body at different places 2 or 3 times a day [much likeis done on the backs of babies needing to burp], in order to clear out the mucus inher lungs,\" she stated. Kathy then began patting Trudy in various places on herbody to show me the ritual she has done since her daughter was 6 months old.Always KnowingAt this point in the interview, Trudy finished her hash browns. I askedKathy when exactly she first told Trudy she had Cystic Fibrosis. She repliedquickly, \"She always knew.\"147\"How is that?\" I asked. \"Because we had a son, 2 years older than her, sothere was another child who didn't have all of that,\" she recalled. Trudy does notcontradict her mother's assessment.Everyday OccurrenceEven the patting and medical treatments for Trudy continued, hergrowing up years were relatively normal, with certain exceptions. During hereighth and ninth grades, she was homebound for a majority of the time because ofher illness.Trudy is a good student who seems to enjoy going to school. When askedwhat school is like for her in the midst of periodic hospital visits and routinelyneeding to be patted, Trudy replied: \"It's\u2014I don't know how to explain it. It'sjust something that I've always done. It's not bad, sometimes it is\u2014sometimesit's bad. But, I have to do it, so. . . .\"Trudy prefers not to dwell on her illness. Kathy says the family has spentless time talking about the illness than simply taking it as an \"everydayoccurrence.\" As medical advancements have been made over time, Trudy'sexpected life span has increased from 20 to 30 years.\"I just try not to think about it. If I dwell on it, I will probably make ithappen [make the situation worse]. So I just try not to think about it,\" Trudystated. She said she talks to only one friend about her illness - her best friend,Michele, who lives on her street. They have lunch together every 2 or 3 days.148Michele is the person whom Trudy called the night before she returned to thehospital on her last visit because she was \"pissed off, sad, depressed, all of it,\"Trudy described.An Answered PrayerDuring her eighth and ninth grades, Trudy's body began to give way to theCystic Fibrosis. As Trudy and her mom recalled, the 15-year-old began a slowdeath march while she waited for a must-have lung transplant in order to live.The 14 months of waiting were incredibly hard on the 15-year-old and herfamily. At times Trudy was uncertain whether she wanted to live or die. \"For awhile there, I didn't care,\" she explained. \"It didn't feel like I was ready [for atransplant]. The first time that we got the call [that lungs had been found for her],I wasn't ready at all. I didn't want to go the surgery. I wasn't physically,emotionally ready,\" Trudy explained.Perhaps Trudy's reticence was situation unfolded, thelungs initially found for Trudy were not medically appropriate for her. A similarsituation happened a second time, again after the family rushed Trudy to a largemetropolitan hospital for another possible transplant.As the saying goes, the third time worked like a charm. After spending anafternoon talking with hospice chaplains and praying to God, Kathy received acall that once again a new set of lungs had become available that might work forTrudy. \"We had talked that afternoon, and we had prayed and everything, and149sure enough, we got the call that night,\" Kathy explained. For the third time,Trudy's parents rushed her to the hospital in the fall of 2002. This time the lungtransplantation was successful.When asked how that makes her feel, Trudy says she feels both happy andsad. \"I can do a lot more. I can do a lot more running than I used to be able to,\"she commented.Home SchoolingEven though she may miss school from time to time, Trudy is required towork daily with a computer for medical purposes. Using a laptop, Trudy takes adeep breath and blows into a mouthpiece that has a sensor connected to thecomputer. Looking at the screen, Trudy can immediately see the lines from herbreathing indicating lung capacity.The numbers from the breathing test that Trudy hopes to see on thecomputer screen range from 105 and 115\u2014acceptable and usual numbers for her.If the numbers are bad, Trudy knows to immediately call Dr. Dixon. Prior to hermost recent hospital stay just before the interview, her numbers dropped to 70 andthen even lower because of a cold. Even a common cold can be deadly forindividuals with CF like Trudy.150TherapyTalking about Trudy's illness within her family unit is complicated. Bothof her parents have remarried. They converse together, and share in theresponsibility of caring for Trudy. Both sets of parents are capable of handling herintravenous (IV) fluid and medication needs at home as warranted. \"We justtransported her from house to house. I guess we ran a portable hospital out of thehouse,\" Kathy recalled.Over the years the entire family has undergone psychological therapy in avariety of ways to try and better cope with Trudy's medical situation along withthe challenges of simple, everyday living within blended families. Kathy saysTrudy's illness has placed pressure on an already struggling and tenuous familycommunication system, including her parents and the new stepparents and \"thedislike they have for each other.\"Yet therapy seems to have helped. \"We talked about the fact that she wasdying because she was. I think the fact that we had a therapist for a year and a halfor 2 years is the only reason the 5 of us got through it,\" Kathy explained. \"Thetherapist helped the 4 adults do a lot. And I highly recommend a non-partialtherapist for the child and then for the adults,\" she added.151Decision-MakingLike most teenagers, Trudy is looking forward to her future independence.She is excited about getting her driver's license when she turns 16. When shebegins dating, she plans on talking with her boyfriends about her illness, butwants to avoid making a big deal of the matter. \"It's hard to tell, but eventually it[the illness] just comes out. I'm scared of rejection,\" she stated.In the meantime, the 15-year-old and her mother seem to experiencetension between them when talking about who is in control of Trudy's healthcaredecisions. Trudy suggested that \"no matter what,\" her physician decides hercourse of treatment now. Her mom chimes in quickly, \"Her father and I decide thecourse of treatment with Dr. Dixon.\"ZingersParent-child relationships are challenging in the best of times. For youngpeople with CF like Trudy, perhaps the stark reality of living with the disease canmake parental relationships even more complicated for numerous reasons,including the fact that the disease itself is handed down to children from adefective gene carried by each parent.For whatever the real reasons, things seemed strained between Trudy andKathy during the interview. How much of their tension stemmed from Trudy'sillness as opposed to usual mother-daughter, teenager challenges is unknown.152Tensions are evidenced during several points of the interview, as would beexpected. Although she is seated next to her mom, she told me: \"I'm closer to mydad, I'm a daddy's girl so I'm closer to my dad. But I have to talk to my mom,too,\" Trudy said. She also commented that regardless of her relationships with herparents, \"It always comes down to my best friend [Michele].\"Kathy replied: \"Her whole entire life, she's lived with me. She's onlylived with her dad these last 10 months. But she's still a daddy's girl. But that'sOK,\" she explained.IsolationGerms are a constant worry for individuals like Trudy who live with life-threatening diseases. Many children and young people battling serious illnesses inpediatric hospitals are seen wearing masks as they walk around the units pushingIV hanging bags on steel carriers.While Trudy was living with her father, she met another young girl withCystic Fibrosis, but was unable to talk with her because of the worry of spreadinggerms between them. \"She could have some bacteria she could give me. I couldhave some bacteria I could give her,\" she explained. Her mother added, \"Theycould talk if they sat 4 feet away from each other. But I don't think either of themmade the attempt,\" she explained. Handshakes can also be problematic and are tobe avoided, according to Kathy and Trudy.153Sibling RealityAlthough Trudy identified her friend Michele as her closest confidant intalking about her illness, she does at times reach out to her 18-year-old brother. Infact, she seemed genuinely happy and surprised that her brother recently visitedher in the hospital with a friend of his. \"He came up and saw me the other daybefore I left the hospital, which is unusual. He doesn't like hospitals too much. Itshocked me,\" she explained.When asked if Trudy ever wonders why she has CF and her brother doesnot, she replied: \"I've asked him that before.\" asked? \"Ithappens,\" she stated with a shrug.JadedTrudy readily admits to becoming jaded while battling CF her entirelifetime. The situation has changed over time depending on her age and emotionalstate. \"The first time that I ever went in [to the hospital], I was 7 and I hated itthen,\" she recalled. \"When I was 12, I went in, and I was all happy because I wasmissing school. And then I got older and felt jaded\u2014too much was going on inmy life,\" she explained.When asked if she views her life as short, medium, or long, she replied: \"Idon't look at it that way,\" she responded. \"I just do what I do\u2014what I can do\u2014with my friends,\" she replied.154Moving OnMedical scientists point to Cystic Fibrosis as one of the more promisingareas of research in modern medicine. On a personal note, Trudy and her mom arecontinuing to pursue any and all available opportunities for new knowledge.After finishing the conversation at the IHOP, they were driving to a largercity to attend a seminar on CF being led by Trudy's primary physician. Kathyuses such support group educational sessions as ways to \"pick up what otherparents are going through,\" she stated. \"You give them suggestions on things thatyou went through because there are a lot of new patients with small babies. Andyou can tell them things that we remember when our children were small,\" sheadded. On a daily basis, Trudy and Kathy continue to move through their lives,viewing the challenge presented by Cystic Fibrosis as an \"everyday occurrence.\"\"We're just like a normal household,\" they added.Whether she lives for a few more years until she is 20 or 30, or defies theodds and lives much longer, Trudy sees her life as a composite of mixed blessingsand future uncertainties. She prefers not to talk about her illness, and does notcare what words other people use when they do. She often seems especiallyfrustrated over being sick. She fondly remembers her years before her lungtransplant as \"having a good life,\" she commented. She continues to pray to God,\"just for health,\" she explained.155For now, Trudy seems grateful to be a normal teenager who just happensto have another person's lungs in her body, although at times she is sad as a resultof the transplant. She recommends that other CF patients \"do the treatment asmuch as they can because even though it may seem like something really good, toget new lungs, it's not really all that good,\" she stated. Trudy hopes to beginfeeling better to avoid another hospital stay like the one she just completedbecause of a cold.The future for Trudy is uncertain. Her transplanted lungs are expected tolast around 5 or 10 years. At that time she can ask to receive another set of lungsif she desires. In the meantime, regardless of how normal her life may be orappear, she thinks about the future in a unique way. \"I just wonder how long thelungs are going to last,\" she pondered.J. BlisteredToday is a good day for 15-year-old Oscar20 because he is \"not tired oranything,\" he explained. Oscar is a stoic young man who responded in shortanswers, and used the word yeah a great deal. He had just spent Thanksgivingweek in the hospital.Oscar is wearing a shiny earring in one ear, given to him by his dad. Hisfather and mother are sitting on each side of him in his small hospital room. Oscar 20 In this story, I have changed the name of the person I call \"Oscar.\"156is 1 of 15 children. His dad, a large man, is sitting in a wheelchair for lack ofanother regular chair. His mother is sitting in a straight chair. I sat down on aphysician's stool that had a tendency to roll. Oscar watched out for the taperecorder so that it did not fall. Doctors and nurses came in and out of the colorlesshospital room, one right after the other. The scenario was chaotic at best.On this particular hospital visit, Oscar had a roommate a few feet away\u2014atiny baby girl receiving chemotherapy through intravenous bags hanging on ashort little roller. The baby was wearing a large pink bow around her baldinghead. The bow gave the room the only visible bright color. Otherwise things weresteel and black and gray.The day before, this same little baby, with the same bow on her head, wassitting in her stroller at the nurses' station. Her short IV hanging-bag stand wasnext to her. She was laughing and giggling and holding court with all the nurses.Today things have changed for the baby. She hollers mightily\u2014evidentlynothing is wrong with her lungs. She fusses and frets constantly. With achronically pained expression, her mother does a variety of things to try andcomfort her baby as the baby jerks about on her lap. Her mother tries to hold hertight, ever mindful that the baby's intravenous drip must remain stable. Nothingseems to help this little one on this particular day.As the baby bow girl continued to fuss, Oscar and his parents told meabout their lives.157Murphy's LawMurphy's Law suggests anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Suchis the case for Oscar.Although he has been coming to the hospital for chemotherapy treatmentsfor over 10 years, Oscar is getting progressively worse. In 1994 he was firstdiagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), a cancer of the blood.21Since that time, his condition has deteriorated. Just recently he relapsed with braincancer.Murphy's Law of ThermodynamicsUnder pressure, things get worse. So suggests Murphy's Law ofThermodynamics.During every interview I have conducted, there always comes a momentwhen I am overwhelmed by the perseverance and attitudes of those who aresharing their stories. This was also true for my interview with Oscar and hisparents.Having said that, the other side of the coin is more tarnished. The family isstruggling mightily. Perhaps they have always struggled. Before the actualinterview began and the tape recorder was turned on, the nurses asked Oscar to go 21 See Leonzo's Lead for more detailed information about this particularform of leukemia.158down the hall for a brief medical procedure. His mother went with him. Iremained in the hospital room with Oscar's father as the baby continued to hollerin her mother's arms.22Oscar's dad proceeded to tell me how difficult things are for the family.They are not communicating or getting along well. In fact, he said that Oscar hastold him on previous days to \"Get away, or I'll kick you in the face.\" Throughoutthe interview, Oscar's father used a familial term, \"Daddy,\" to refer to his son.Knowing No DifferenceThe first 5 years of Oscar's life were normal. The next 10 years have beenanything but, given the amount of time he has spent in and out of hospitalsbattling leukemia and now brain cancer. Oscar is incredibly astute in knowing thespecific details of his medical treatments, including what his statistical numbersand counts mean in terms of future treatments.When asked how he feels to have spent over 10 years battling cancer, heresponded: \"I've been here so many times, I'm used to it.\"AnticipationAlthough Oscar does not talk very much in general, he says that hearingwhat his nurses have to say about his condition is helpful because then he knows 22 The interview with Oscar and his family was obtained with eachparticipant's willingness to speak in front of the baby's mother who agreed toconfidentiality in what she may or may not have heard.159what is coming his way. Although he has been coming to the hospital for years,battling brain cancer is different in some respects than battling leukemia.Anticipation is challenging. Knowledge makes things easier. For now asalways, the family will continue to take things one day at a time. At this point inthe conversation, Oscar's father interjected a comment to his wife: \"Your moneycomes in today, remember? The check. It should come in today.\" No oneresponded.AskingOscar is especially appreciative of the physicians and nurses who ask himwhat he wants. Not only do they ask him if he needs anything in the way of basicitems such as water or a blanket, they also ask him how he wants to hear the latestnews involving his condition.\"They ask me first if I want them to tell me straight out,\" he explained. Heprefers \"regular, straight-out\" words, but does not elaborate.Punching BagsOscar's father spoke at great length about his ongoing frustration over hisson's situation, including the inconveniences on the family of his receivingmedical care away from home. Remembering a time that treatment was notdelivered to his son despite a trip to the hospital, the father said, \"I had to drive 28miles. And then, basically there was no reason for him [referring to his son] to be160here. And then, my wife, she has a hard time taking care of him, working, payingbills. It's really an inconvenience,\" he commented. \"You know, the time he[Oscar] spends in here, she could be working, earning money. Like I said, she candeal with it. It bothers me a lot,\" he added.The father continued, \"He [Oscar] never talks to me about it [his illness].Him and I never talk about it, and I don't know if Mom does or not. But, I try toget close to him, but there is, I don't know, he just . . . I guess, in situations likethis, somebody is a punching bag, and that happens to be me,\" he stated.Oscar's father also related a scenario in which he feels he was wronglyaccused of being dishonest in claiming disability benefits because of his badknees. \"That's part of the things that I've got to deal with. When I ask questions,she [pointing to his wife] gets mad.\" At this point, his wife got up and left theroom. She returned a little while later and said nothing about her departure. Bodylanguage suggested she was extremely upset and angry with her husband.Oscar's father continued while his wife was gone and his son remained inthe hospital bed: \"A lot of times, he's in the hospital, I come in, and she gets upand walks out. I don't know. I guess I'm supposed to be superman and not hurtand not have any pains,\" he stated. \"I don't know. I've got Spondelosis (old age,fused vertebrae, joint problems). You know, your bones start developing bonespurs. I've got 5 herniated discs, I've got torn tendons, and I got nerve damage inmy legs from an injury. There are days when I feel like my legs are just going to161give out on me,\" he commented. \"I guess I'm just not supposed to deal with thosekinds of things,\" he questioned.\"All men are strong. All men set aside their problems,\" the fathersuggested. \"[But] I've been where he's at,\" he said, looking over at his son. \"I'vebeen through it. And no amount of words can comfort someone,\" he commented.My belief was that Oscar's father was referring more to his own healthcare andperceived unfair life situation than he was to the plight of his son who was sittingin the hospital bed near him battling leukemia and brain cancer.Foul PlayOscar's father talked more during the interview than did either Oscar orhis mom. Only infrequently did the family members refer to each other bypersonal names, as opposed to he and she, and her and him. They seldom lookedat each other. There was a sense on my part that if the father had not been in theroom, the interview would have been quite different.Communication lines were definitely complicated, if not at timesnonexistent within this family unit. Once Oscar's dad recalled asking his son whatthe physician had said. His son replied, according to the dad: \"Why don't you goask him?\"Both Oscar's mother and father remembered their son's initial diagnosis ofleukemia in 1993 when Oscar had barely started school at age 5. His mothercommented: \"I remember my mother [Oscar's grandmother] look right, this doesn't look right.' I guess she was telling me thatbecause she at that time wasn't working full-time, and I guess she was seeingshows [television shows about diseases] or something like that,\" she added. \"Andthen I went to work and he [her husband] went to work, and then he came backfrom what I remember, and he took him [Oscar] to the physician and found outwhat he had. And then he went to my job to let me know so we could tell him[Oscar],\" she added.Oscar's father recalled: \"I took him [Oscar] to school that morning to tellthem that I was going to pick him up at 10 o'clock because if they are in schooluntil 10, they are counted for the whole day,\" he explained. \"I was told somebodyfrom Child Protective Services wanted to talk to me because of his bruises. I toldthe lady, 'Well, that's why I'm taking him to the doctor.' I said, 'Well, you don'tthink I'm hurting my son, do you?' And she said, 'Well, we need to make sure.'And I said, 'Well, he's my only son; I wouldn't do that.' 'Well,' she answeredloudly, and she said, 'sometimes single them out.' And I'm like, 'I don'tneed this.' So when she turned her back, we took off, and I took him to thedoctor,\" he recalled. Then he turned to his son and asked, \"Do you remember,Daddy?\" Oscar did not respond.Oscar's mother explained that her son's severe bruising had started theweek before his initial diagnosis. \"Then it was finally when we came home, andwe saw him on top of the fence by the tree, remember? He said that he had fallen163and hurt himself. And that's where I thought the black eyes had come from. Andit wasn't even from that,\" she commented.When the initial diagnosis was made, the physician first asked Oscar'sparents if they would go into his office to sit down and talk. \"I said 'No, you needto tell me right now where we stand,'\" Oscar's father said. The physician toldthem that Oscar had leukemia. The family went straight to the pediatric cancerhospital.Murphy's ConstantMurphy's Constant suggests that matter will be damaged in directproportion to its value. Oscar and his family are damaged. Scholars suggestreceiving a terminal diagnosis can be likened to the effect of looking directly atthe sun: It blinds, it is intense, and it can cause damage.23For Oscar and his parents, this is the second time in their lives they arelooking directly at the sun. Leukemia first, now brain cancer. They are hurting, intheir own ways. Oscar's mom said she will maintain her vigil in \"faith and trust,\"and will continue to \"pray for the people who are helping you. Give themknowledge and wisdom. That God may, you know, that the hands may be Hishands as far as the healing and the care,\" she stated. 23 Hutchings, D. (1998). Communicating with metaphor: A dance withmany veils. The American Journal of Hospice & Palliative Care, 15, 282-284.164ImagineListening to this family's conversation is a challenge. These individuals donot like each other, or at least they struggle with each other much of the time. Yetno doubt the parents both love their son. Perhaps leaving the room as Oscar'smother did for much of the interview is a way to keep the peace or minimize thediscord during these tough times.For me personally, I imagine a great deal of anger and pain on the part of15-year-old Oscar who has leukemia and is now facing brain cancer. BecauseOscar has refused to say very much in front of his parents, I can only imagine hisinternal thoughts when he hears his father complain about bone spurs and havingto drive 28 miles to the hospital, all the while trying to convince his son that heknows exactly what the younger boy is experiencing. In my opinion, the attemptat such an empathetic comparison seems ludicrous and mean-spirited, butcertainly I have not walked in these individuals' shoes. Nor is the story mine totell.John Lennon wrote, \"Life is what happens to you / While you're busymaking other plans.\"24 For Oscar and his family, I get the strong sense based onboth conversation and observance that Murphy's Laws are wearing them down. 24 John Lennon, lyric from \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy),\" on the 1980John Lennon/Yoko Ono album Double Fantasy.165They are tired and weary after 10 years of fighting on a variety of fronts. Yet forwhatever their reasons, they have shared part of their story with a total stranger.Within the nucleus of the family unit, a 15-year-old boy whose futureremains highly unsettled imagines a better and more hopeful world for others likehim. As I asked Oscar one of the final questions, it is one of the few times in theconversation he does not shrug, and say \"Yeah\" or \"Nah\" or nothing at all.Instead, he deliberately pulls a silver necklace with a cross on it from underneathhis shirt, and responds:Question:What would you say to other newly diagnosed cancerpatients your age?Oscar:Everything will be all right.EpilogueAs his situation grew worse, Oscar decided to stop going to the hospitalfor chemotherapy treatments. His physician indicated to me that the decision wasagainst the wishes of his parents. The stoic young man with the shiny earring diedin the early part of 2004.166K. Good News, Mijito! What The Hell!Frequently there are good moments and days in a children's cancerhospital, like when positive news is delivered to a patient. On this particular day,16-year-old Arthur25 is doing wheelies in his wheelchair in a hospital room,having just received some good news: His blood counts were doing fine, and\"there is no trace of leukemia anymore,\" said his mother, Iris. Iris was grinningfrom ear to ear when she said those words.Arthur is anxious to tell his story about when he first learned he hadleukemia in 2001, and his life up until that day when he received his good news.Even though the hour is later, and the mother and son have a 3-hour drive aheadof them, both are willing to stay and be interviewed.Arthur was grinning from ear to ear as he continued to circle around thecenter of his little hospital room in his wheelchair. His mother talked a lot, whichseemed to frustrate the 16-year-old. Yet Arthur wanted to tell his own story, hisway. He persevered.InterruptionsThroughout the dialogue, the give and take between Arthur and his momwas consistently funny and poignant. Iris is a happy-go-lucky large 25 In this story, I have changed the names of the people I call \"Arthur,\"\"Iris,\" \"Dr. Rose,\" and \"Laura.\"167woman with an ample bosom. She switches from English to Spanish and backagain in the blink of an eye. One immediately senses she is the definite ringleaderand matriarch of her family, for whom the saying was written: \"Mama ain'thappy? Nobody's happy.\" Iris repeatedly referred to her son in loving terms ofSpanish endearment such as mijito (my son).While Arthur and his mother played point-counterpoint, I felt as if I waswatching a tennis volley or a television episode of Everybody Loves Raymond inwhich Raymond's meddlesome and martyrdom mother, Marie, is bugging herfully grown sons by telling them what to say and when, interrupting them whenthey try to say what she's told them to say, and then re-explaining what they saidbecause they said it all wrong. Like Marie, Iris even periodically pinched her sonon the cheek and played kissy-face with him, which finally made Arthur explodein total exasperation, \"MAAAAAA!\" Arthur could be a young Raymond.An example follows of one of many exchanges between the 15-year-oldArthur, who looked like Raymond, and his mom, who reminded me of Marie:Question:[To Arthur.] Do you remember when they first told youabout the leukemia?Arthur:[Arthur began to answer. His mother immediatelyinterrupted.]Iris/Mother:We all went to pick him up from school and that's whenhe saw us, and then all of us went to the doctor's office.All of us entered the doctor's office. And they wereready for us with a room and everything, and I said 'Ohmy God, what's happening?' But then we came into theroom, and we sat down, and he was on the table, right,168the examining table? And then the doctor came in. Andthen [to Arthur], what did the doctor say?Arthur:You're telling the whole story. [He looks in frustrationat his mother.]Iris/Mother:No, please. [She sits back in her chair, pouts, and putsher purse on her lap. She motions for her son to speak.]Arthur:[to his mother] Say what you want to say.Iris/Mother:Well, that's all I wanted to say.Iris then stoically looked away with no animation for the next few seconds, as ifshe was mad and was not going to say another word whatsoever. Within a veryfew minutes, however, she became animated again, interrupted her son, andanother conversation just like the one above took place. This type of exchangehappened over and over throughout the interview.Oh, *+#!Nosebleeds were among several indications that something was wrongwith Arthur. One day when he was nearly 15, he recalled feeling especially sick.He had awakened with a nosebleed, and was dizzy. \"I woke up, and I went to geta glass of water, and I was walking,\" he recalled. \"I felt real dizzy, and I hit thewall on the side of the garage. I spilled the water, and was like, 'Oh, shit.'\" Withthat, his mother quickly interrupted and said to her son: \"Don't say bad words.\"He replied: \"Well, that's what I said.\" Iris glared at her son.169At this point in the interview I explained to both of them that total honestyduring the interviews in remembering the way things truly happened waspreferred. I also tried to reassure them their actual names would not be used inany final documents. Iris continued to glare at her son and act embarrassed.What the F---!Despite feeling badly, Arthur went on to school on the day he finallyfound out about his illness. His mother awaited test results from a physician'sappointment the week before. The physician's staff called Iris mid-morning, andtold her Arthur needed an additional test called a CA 125. Iris distinctlyremembered the term CA 125. As a former medical office assistant, she knew CAmeant cancer.While Iris was talking with the physician and nurse about the CA 125 test,Arthur continued to have a rough morning at school. \"I had like first period, and itwas reading. I had a reading class, and I told my teacher that I wasn't feeling toogood, and she said that I looked pale. I went to the nurse and I told her, 'Hey, Ifeel bad.' And she said, 'Oh yeah, you look real bad, you look pale.'\" During thesecond period class, Arthur was called on the intercom, and told to go to theoffice. \"I was like, Cool, OK,\" he said.He waited for his mother in the office. \"I was just waiting there, and mymom, it took her like 10 minutes to get there,\" he recalled. \"She came in, and shesigned something, and it was like, 'Well. . . .'\" Arthur hesitated before saying170what he wanted to say. Then he spoke and said what he thought to himself at thetime: \"What the fuck? I said; What the fuck?\"Now Arthur's mother looked as if she was going to have a heart attack. Isaid nothing. Iris shot her son another look, and pleadingly said to him: \"Mijito,please.\" Arthur continued: \"And I thought someone had of the wayshe was . . . , and we were all. I got into the Dodge Ram truck, and we were on theway to the clinic, and it was all serious.\"LeucemiaTogether the family made the 3-hour drive to a nearby metropolitan area.Medical personnel were waiting for Arthur. \"We're in this room and then I satdown on this table where they do all this stuff,\" he recalled. \"And the doctor satdown and he said, 'Your son, tu hijo tiene leucemia.' And all of a sudden my dadjust started crying and got very freaked out, and I got freaked out,\" Arthurremembered.\"I was like, 'What the hell? What is that?' And he [Arthur's father] wascrying for like 5 minutes or something, and we were all quiet. My brother was justlike quiet and my mother was like, 'Stop it\u2014you are going to make him [Arthur]cry. You are scaring him.' And the doctor was like, 'OK, cry it out,'\" Arthurrecalled. \"I said, 'OK, doctor, what is, que es, lucemia?' And he said, 'Es canceren tu sangre.' And I'm like, 'It's cancer in my blood? Oh, what the shit. Me?Cancer. What the hell.'\"171The WordArthur specifically remembered hearing the word leukemia for the firsttime. \"I didn't know leukemia. I didn't know that word. But I did know whatcancer meant. Cancer is like for old people. I'm not old; what the hell,\" hereflected.Go Right Now. Pack No Bags.The immediacy and severity of the situation was not lost on the 14-year-old. \"They said 'OK, you guys are supposed to . . . , I've already called thedoctors over there, and you have to go [to the cancer clinic in the larger hospital]right now. Don't even go home and pack\u2014right now, real serious, just drive overthere.'\" He continued, \"And then we went and we were driving on the way, andthen my dad and everyone was all crying, and my mom, she was all nervous. Idon't know what she was thinking,\" he recalled. Then he turned to his mom andasked her: \"What were you thinking?\" The exchange at that moment indicatedthey had never re-lived together the important experience of a few years earlier.A Liquid DietIris' mind was racing at the time. \"Everybody was [crying]. My husbandwas crying the 2 hours, 3 hours, in the back of the car, the truck, he was with him[Arthur] and hugging him and crying and crying and crying and crying. And I waslike, Oh my God,\" Iris recalled.172She continued: \"I'm always too hungry, because I always like to eat toomuch\u2014back then,\" she joked and laughed, inferring that she does not eat toomuch now. \"No, but anyway, I was not even hungry. I didn't even want to eat onthe way. We stopped to get some hamburgers, but we just ordered some DietCokes or whatever. But we were not able to eat, because we were not hungry,\"she added.The family raced to the large hospital during which time Iris hoped andprayed for a good doctor. \"And I said, 'Oh my God, I hope that we find a gooddoctor.' We didn't expect nothing, we did not know too much about leukemia. He[Arthur] knows what cancer is. I know cancer. Cancer of the lungs, or whatever.But to me, I didn't know what was involved with leukemia to the extent that I donow,\" Iris said.\"So when we got here they do the spinal tap right away, and they said thathe didn't have any leukemia in the spinal tap, but that the white blood cell countwas very high. It was 300,000\u2014the normal is 5,000 to 10,000 white bloodcells\u2014and he had 300,000, so it was very high at risk. So they gave him veryaggressive treatment to cure the leukemia, and that's what they said they woulddo,\" she added.EpisodesThe family stayed at the large hospital for a month during their initial visit.The weeks were hard, especially when Arthur hallucinated because of the173chemotherapy and steroids. His mother began: \"One time in the middle of thenight. . . .\"Arthur interrupted her because it was his story to tell. \"There was this onetime that I woke up, like, I had a dream that I was going to kill everybody on earthbut, like, with my eye, like Cyclops\u2014kind of like XMEN. But like if I opened myeyes, I would kill everything,\" he remembered. \"And I woke up screaming and Iwas like, Oh, wow,\" he added.There were other episodes in the midst of never-ending vomiting. Arthurrecalled another time when he was back at home in his own bed: \"I woke up, andI thought I was dead. I was. I woke up, and I still thought I was dreaming. But itwas real\u2014I was just in my bed. I was like, Oh, what am I doing, is this where I'msupposed to be? And like, I'm dead. What am I doing here? I know I'm in myroom, but it's not my room. And I was like, getting up, and moving around andtrying to know where I am,\" he added. His mom quickly interjected, \"It wasterrible.\"Arthur continued: \"I was like, What the hell? And then I looked out thewindow, and I was like, I'm still here, but I'm not here. I was banging on my doorand saying: Help me, someone help me. I just got on my bed, and made myselfinto a ball, and was like, What the hell, what the hell? I remembered, Hey, well,open the door. And if I remembered and if it opened, I would be alive. And so Iopened the door and I was like, Oh, OK. Then I went to my mom's room and my174dad's room and I was like, 'Hey,' and that night I was all scared.\" Iris quicklyinterjected: \"Yeah, he was all scared.\"TGIAWhen he was diagnosed 2 years ago, Arthur wondered every day whatwas going to happen to him. He wondered about his treatments, where he wouldspend his time, and how sick he would be on any given day.Over time Arthur has become less concerned about his daily issues. He isnow more philosophical. He appreciates the help of the medical staff in that they\"make you feel comfortable in knowing what's going to happen to you. And theymake you more open-minded about what's going on. They prepare you for what'scoming next,\" he added.When asked what he thinks about now in terms of his life, he replied: \"Uh,I don't know; thank God I'm alive.\"Straight UpArthur is practical in his thinking about how young people should be toldthey have cancer. \"Well, now, I think there is no other way [than straight-forward]to tell you that you have cancer because, I mean, because you think at that time,Oh gee, 12-year-old, real harsh, could you tell me in a nicer way?\" He continued:\"How well or nice can it be told?\" He makes his voice cheery, then grave: \"'Gee,175hee hee, you've got and bodacious,much to his mother's periodic chagrin. \"If you just have it [cancer], there isnothing else they can do. Like, you're paralyzed, what do you do, you go to thedoctor, 'Gee, doc, I'm paralyzed, what do you got for me?' The response: 'Whydon't you take this wheelchair and roll your ass around town?' And like blindpeople, 'Oh, I'm blind; oh I'm blind, what do you got for me?' 'Why don't youtake this dog, and let him drag your ass around.' I mean, what the hell? If you justgot shit, shit, there is nothing else. There is nothing else you can do,\" Arthurcommented. His mother continued to glare at her son.Two StrikesArthur has been told twice that he has cancer. He relapsed after his initialdiagnosis. That time the cancer was found in his spine. His physician called hismother on a Friday afternoon.\"Dr. Rose called me . . . on Friday to let me know that something waswrong,\" Iris recalled. Then he called her back because he said he knew she wouldnot be able to continue with the weekend, so he told her by phone. \"'I want to tellyou by phone, but I want to see you on Monday.' And he told me: 'Arthur gotleukemia again on his spine.' The spinal tap is where they saw the little traces ofleukemia,\" Iris explained. \"So he told me, it's just a little.\"176\"I told the doctor, 'OK, but don't tell Arthur.' I didn't want to tell anyone,because I didn't want to,\" his mom explained. Arthur recalled: \"I came in first thistime, and they came [the medical team members]. They wanted to talk to myparents first. I waited in the room, and I was watching TV, and they called me,'Hey, come in here.' The doctor was sitting down, and dad, my mom [and thenurses whom he called by name]. My nurse, Laura, was there, and she was like,kind of crying. Well, like, tears in her eyes. And I was like, 'Oh, shit. Straightup,'\" Arthur told them.Arthur's physician said to him: \"'Arthur, you have cancer again. Wefound some in your spine, and it's going to your head. You have cancer again,'\"Arthur recalled. Arthur said that Dr. Rose was visibly upset when he delivered thenews. \"Oh, yeah. He was kind of like, watery eyes, and my dad was watery eyes,and he said, 'The only thing we can do is just do a bone marrow transplant. Idon't want you to think that everything we have been doing with thechemotherapy is just a total waste of time. It didn't work, but if you want to dothis [the transplant] so you can live . . . ,' and I said, 'Well, yeah. Do it. I want tolive. Do this,'\" Arthur mandated.BrotherishArthur's big brother was his bone marrow donor. \"My brother and me,well, I love him to death because he's my big brother, and he always takes care ofme,\" Arthur explained.177At one point Arthur's older brother told him: \"You know, I'm alwaysthere for you and thank God that you and I have the same blood for you to bealive.\" Arthur calls such conversations brotherish.DadNot only is Arthur extremely close to his brother, he speaks very fondly ofhis father. Trading places with his son is something Arthur's dad wishes he coulddo, according to the 16-year-old.\"Sometimes with my dad, he's just quiet about it. He doesn't want to showhow he feels, but I know how he feels,\" Arthur explained. \"He doesn't want mesuffering. He would rather want him [to suffer], than to see me suffer. It hurts tosee me in pain,\" he added.The 'D' WordAll of the family members think about the possibility of cancer killingArthur. The reality that in the last 2 years cancer has been found in his blood,spine, and brain is especially discouraging. \"Yeah, everyone thinks about death,\"Arthur stated. Yet he is philosophical and seemingly resolved in his words: \"If theday comes, there is no stopping it,\" he stated matter-of-factly.In the meantime, Arthur is optimistic. \"I've always thought about going on[continuing to live]. . . . 'Oh, I have cancer again'\" he said, simulating a178conversation in reference to his last relapse. \"It's not going to stop me. I'll keepon going forever.\"He continued with a question that he answered himself: \"Why don't I giveup? I want to live, all to the fullest in this life, before I go to the next,\" he added.A Mom's Faith and PhilosophyFor Iris, things seemed to be not quite as simple or straightforward.Perhaps she talks and interrupts her son a lot to sort things out in her own mind, orto make things better for her son. Whatever the reason, Iris readily admits she isscared about the possibility of losing Arthur.\"I'm scared about him dying for sure. I always thought that I'm not goingto make it if he dies. I don't know what I'm going to do. But God has given mestrength to focus. . . . My faith is that he is going to survive, because God alreadymade a miracle on his life. I know it for sure, and when God makes a miracle, Hedoesn't take it away. He gives you the miracle and that's it,\" she explained.\"And I know that I have 2 sons only, and through my oldest son he gaveme the life of this one [looking at her son sitting in the wheelchair], because of hisblood that he gave to him. So I try not to think of that. But when I was thinking,one time he was very sick, like 2 or 3 times he was very sick here in the hospital,so I was crying too much, because I don't want for him to be dead. I don't wantto,\" she stated.179She continued, \"And I know that my husband is not going to tolerate that[her constant crying]\u2014nobody is going to tolerate that, but I just keep on prayingand praying and praying every day. I'm happy now. I'm happier than beforebecause I know that he is doing good, even though he is not walking this moment,but he's here, and he's going to walk, this is not forever. This is just for his bonesto get better. So I'm trying not to think that something bad is going to happen tohim because I know that he's OK,\" she added.GratitudeRegardless of what may or may not be in store for him in the future,Arthur continues to understand that others are in similar and often worse medicalsituations. When he first saw young children who had lost legs to cancer, the 14-year-old told Iris: \"Oh, Mom, you see, I should be happy. I'm happy at least Ihave all my [legs and arms]\u2014at least I have only leukemia. At least I don't havecancer in my legs, Mom, because look, it's better than them. I have leukemia [andI am better] than them that have cancer in their legs because they don't have legs.At least me, I can walk,\" Arthur stated.Yet his mother sees things differently than her son, including when herson said he was glad he did not have bone cancer. \"I said [to herself, although sheis now saying this in front of her son], It's worse for you, mijito, because you havecancer in your whole blood. Imagine that. But I'm not going to take away thatillusion that it's better to have leukemia than cancer of the legs. But I'm not going180to take away what you were thinking. To you, it was doing you good,\" she said toher son. \"Because if I said, 'It's mijito, because of. . . .'\" Her voice trailsoff. She does not finish her sentence.Faith and FamilyWhat sustains Iris is her love for her family and her faith. If she weretalking to a parent of a child newly diagnosed with cancer, she would tell him orher: \"'It doesn't matter what the doctor tells you, you have to believe in whatJesus says. That God says that if you believe in Him, you have to walk by faith,not what you see around. If the doctor says he has cancer, it's not the end of theworld. You just have to focus your life, everything on the word of Jesus, and withJesus. Or you believe that in God, you are going to make it.' Because there is onlyso much that you can do. 'Yes, it's going to be difficult because you are notaccustomed to your routine, and what you do in everyday life. It's going tochange everything,'\" she continued. \"'It's going to change too many things. Youare going to have to be with him all the time in the hospital, and you have toworry about the temperatures coming up and down. Because if you see a hike intemperature, and you don't take care of that, then he can die,'\" she added.In the last 2 years, Iris has spent most of her life taking care of heryoungest son in addition to her work, her older son, her husband, and herextended family. She talks like a rock star's road manager in saying she does \"all181the booking\" for her son's medical appointments, which she never missesattending in person for any reason.She is also Arthur's driver, making the 6-hour round-trip visit to and fromthe cancer hospital at least 3 times a week. During one particularly bad episodefor her son, Iris made the 6-hour drive twice in one day. Regardless of thedistance, she is eternally grateful for the hospital and its personnel who arehelping her son.Only Stupid PeopleBecause of Arthur's consistent usage of curse words despite repeatedchastisements from his mother, I asked him toward the end of the interview if hewere angry about his situation. \"I guess, in a way. I wish I [were] OK. Everyonehas problems, even if they are not medical problems\u2014people have problems withtheir marriage or child abuse. Of course, I'm angry, a little bit, but I have to dealwith it,\" he replied stoically.One of the ways Arthur deals with his anger is by talking to his friends.Some understand; many do not. Some of his friends simply say to Arthur: 'Oh,well, that sucks.' \"And some of them try to give me advice but they don't evenmake sense. It's like, What the hell are you talking about, are you stoned?\"One of the stupidest things people say to Arthur, including one of hisfemale friends with whom he goes to school, is that \"things happen for a reason,\"he commented. \"People who don't really think, say that. Someone who thinks that182quote is good . . .\" At that time, Arthur's mother interrupts and says to her son:\"Sometimes I say quote.\" He immediately replies: \"No, that's stupid!\" Sheretorts: \"Well, asks \"[You say]'everything happens for a reason'?\" She responds: \"Well, please, sometimes I saythat.\" The exchange between the two ends, and the room falls silent.After a few minutes, Arthur is again philosophical: \"People have their ownbeliefs. It just happens, OK, it just happens. But I didn't want to hear that. Iwanted to hear, you know, that 'You can always talk to us about it' or 'I'm alwayshere for you, whenever you need a friend, I'm here,' something like that. Not inthose exact words, but something. I was supposed to hear some comforting words,not some stupid stuff,\" he argued. \"Yeah, it was like she [his school friend] didn'teven care. There are some people who understand and then some people whodon't. That's what kind of makes me angry. She said the wrong thing, so OK,whatever,\" he stated.Arthur wonders if people distance themselves from people like him whoare ill, especially young people, because they do not know what to say, or theymay say something wrong or stupid. \"Yeah, some people don't know what to say.I think it's because it scares them, or they don't hang out with me as much as theyused to, or they don't want to see their friend like that. But you have to seesomebody like that. It's better that they are like that, and they are your friends.You can talk to them,\" he stated.183He continued: \"it's like, cancer is not contagious, don't let them think that,I'm like, Read a book. You have the Internet? Well, use it,\" he added.Not AnymoreArthur began to do more wheelies about the room, as he did periodicallythroughout the interview. There is a sense he and his mother will continue theirown banter throughout their 3-hour drive home.When asked what he might say to a newly diagnosed cancer patient,Arthur quickly responded: \"I would just tell him, I hope everything works out thebest for you, and it's not easy. You have some hard times, you are going to feellike you want to die because of all the pain you feel. It hurts you so much, yoursoul, it really feels like too much,\" he stated.He continued: \"You just want to say, 'Forget it. I want to die.' But don'tfeel like that. Find other ways to make yourself feel better. Like, listen to music ortalk to people about it. Stay occupied. Even when you feel bad, when you feellike, when you feel real bad, like something inside of me is biting me, orsomething, use your imagination. Pretend you are at the beach with girls allaround you or something\u2014something\u2014escape from that. Hopefully you wouldbe OK,\" he offered.On this Good News day, Arthur continued his 'straight talk' philosophy ashe did another wheelie: he commented. \"I havecancer\u2014but not anymore,\" he said with a smile and a turn.184L. Quiet ConsiderationsFran26 looks like a stunningly beautiful model for hair shampoo in awomen's magazine that guarantees to improve your life by turning your long, dry,lifeless hair into a cascade of fine silk running down your back. Whatever she isdoing to her hair, the product is working for her: Fran is simply exquisite fromhead to toe as she enters a coffee shop next to a busy bookstore. She is 17 yearsold.People watch her walk through the coffee shop. She does not seem tonotice. She is a cross between Jackie Kennedy and Audrey Hepburn in blue jeans,a T-shirt, and jacket. Her eyelashes are long and beautiful, and they frame dark,expressive eyes highlighted by sparkly shadow. You can almost picture her on aSaturday afternoon at the shopping mall with a group of her teenage girlfriends,each trying to decide what color of shiny eye shadow to buy.In sum, Fran is drop-dead (excuse the pun) gorgeous. She carries a quietand unassuming countenance with her beauty, which makes her even moreattractive.Neither Fran nor I thought to tell each other what we looked like when weset up the interview on the phone. She has arrived at the coffee shop well after ourappointed time late one afternoon. Prior to that moment, I was convinced she was 26 In this story, I have changed the name of the person I call \"Fran.\"185going to be a no-show, although she knew I was driving several hours specificallyto interview her.Although I was the only female sitting alone in the place, and my taperecorder and notebook were in front of me on a table I had strategically selectedin a corner area, she did not scan the room upon arrival, nor even glance over myway to make any type of eye contact. Instead, she immediately walked directly tothe middle of the room.She sat down, and ordered nothing. She just sat with one elbow proppedup on the table, her head resting on that elbow. Her body language suggested shewas tired, bored, or mad\u2014maybe all of the above.For a few minutes I continued to sit at my own table in the corner,wondering if this was indeed Fran. Although I knew Fran was 17 years old, thisyoung woman looked much older. And her captivating beauty, independence, andmobility were not things I had counted on since most of the interview respondentsto date had noticeable signs of medical problems like oxygen tanks andwheelchairs.For a few minutes, we both just sat at our respective tables. Then I tookthe initiative and walked over to her. She immediately looked up and smiled whenI asked, \"Are you Fran?\" She shook my hand loosely, and apologized for beinglate because she could not wake up from an afternoon nap after school ended. Ithanked her for agreeing to the interview. She repeatedly replied, \"No problem.\"186After a few moments of idle chatter between the two of us, I moved mynotebook and tape recorder over to where she was sitting. She was alone at thecoffee shop because her father dropped her off to meet me for the conversation.Interestingly enough, she has viewed much of her life as being alone or at leastdifferent.Save for the intermittent buzz of a noisy and aggravating coffee grinderand a young man periodically shouting \"Tall, mocha latte light\" or somesemblance thereof, Fran began to tell me about her exceptional young life. Itstarted 17 years ago as a healthy baby born on New Year's Day.Problems GaloreFrom across the table, Fran appeared to be in picture-perfect health. Shesmiled a great deal; her teeth were shiny and white; and she seemed to feelrelatively well. She looked like any other average, albeit extra-beautiful, teenager.When you begin to talk with her, however, you cannot help but notice herbeautifully expressive eyes periodically roll way back up into her head. Theabnormality is significantly noticeable.However, eye rolling is among the least of her problems although it is oneof the many offshoots of a lifetime of healthcare issues. When Fran was 4, shewas diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a slowly progressing187cancer that affects the body's white blood cells.27 CML is considered rare in thatit affects only about 6,000 new individuals every year. Fran's brother, 6 years hersenior, was her bone marrow transplant donor in 1990.Fran has been in remission from the leukemia for 13 years. However,other problems have arisen, creating significant long-term healthcare issues forher.One of her problems is that she has Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) - anillness causing severe swelling and destruction of the skin and mucousmembranes. It usually begins in the form of a body rash.28 Given that the mucusmembranes eventually become involved with the rash, ulcerations can form on theeyelids and within the mouth. Over time the rash progresses and develops blistersthat are sometimes severe enough to be categorized as third-degree burns. Manychildren with severe SJS are treated in hospital burn units.SJS is extremely rare. In the United States, the incidence of SJS isestimated to be between 2.6 and 7.1 cases per 1 million persons per year.29 Mostscientists say SJS stems from an allergic-type reaction to medications, although 27 CMLHelp.org.

Retrieved Jan. 14, 2004,from http://www.cmlhelp.org/cml/events1.htm.28 iVillage (2001, April Health: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome fromhttp://www.parentsplace.com/health/illnesses/qas/0,,239266_101322,00.html.29 eMedicine (2001, 10). Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). RetrievedJan. 14, 2004, from http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic268.htm.188the exact cause is still being debated. Besides eye problems, SJS also causes avariety of skin lesions inside and outside the body. Symptoms from SJS have leftFran with significant scaring on her intestines. As a result, she has undergone anintestinal triple bypass.The bypass surgery triggered Reactive Airway Disease (RAD). RAD isalso frequently referred to as pediatric asthma. Symptoms include recurrentwheezing, recurrent coughing, fever, and altered mental states.30 Pediatric asthma,or RAD, is a leading cause of hospitalization, chronic disease, and schoolabsenteeism.31 In severe cases of RAD, damage to the lungs can accumulate overtime to such a degree that the airways can become permanently narrowed.Fran's life seems almost like a strong onion that is being peeled back,layer by layer. At each step of the way, there is strong emotional and physicalreaction. At this point in the interview, I noticed that Fran is smiling. She says sheis smiling because her list of maladies seems almost comical to her when shethinks about her whole life as a young person.She continued to add to the list. \"Then later I got epilepsy. And that'sabout it,\" she stated matter-of-factly with a smile. 30 eMedicine (2003, Nov. 18). Pediatrics, Reactive Airway Disease.Retrieved Jan. 14, 2004, from http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic363.htm.31 University of Maryland Medicine (2002, Sept. 13). Pediatric asthma.Retrieved Jan. 14, 2004, from http://www.umm.edu.189From a DistanceFran continues to battle epileptic seizures and breathing problems on aroutine basis. She sleeps with oxygen at night, which makes her feel different.\"At first, when I began to understand all this, I was just a little upset. I felt reallylike different from everyone else, but now I am beginning to accept that it's in thepast. Even though it has affected me now, I am just going to have to accept it, andtry to be a normal person,\" she explained.While she works hard to accept her illness, she senses that others run awayfrom it, and thus from her. \"I think they [people] keep their distance, because mymom is like that. She is afraid to tell me stuff sometimes, because she is afraid ofsaying the wrong things, or she knows she can't do anything about it, except takeme to the doctors and try to get medicine,\" she mentioned.She continued, \"My dad has relied more on faith. He'll just pray to God,and I tell him that I don't really have that faith right now. And he says to keepdoing it. I really don't like to communicate with my father about that,\" she added.CoverFran was only 4 when she encountered leukemia. She remembers firstbeing diagnosed in April. Her parents were upset because it was around Easter.She vaguely remembers some of her many early days spent in the hospital,190including the nurses and other healthcare professionals who went out of their wayto be funny so she would have more good than bad days.Despite their best intentions, physicians frightened Fran\u2014more so than thenurses. \"The nurses explained a lot to me. I guess I got to be better friends withthe nurses, since they were there longer than the doctors,\" Fran explained. Shealso said the physicians seemed to know before anyone else that something badwas going to happen.\"Doctors? I know I didn't really like them coming, so I kind of got undermy covers and stuff when they came. I was kind of scared,\" she recalled.WordsRemission is a good word for cancer patients like Fran. Yet there are manymore bad words. For Fran, the bad-word dictionary includes words and phraseslike surgery, come back, seizures, found something there, and new medication.Fran does not specifically remember being told she was sick. \"I doremember some stuff in the hospital. But I don't really remember pain oranything,\" she commented. \"I know my mother told me that I told her, \"Mommy,I know I'm sick.\"Sacrificial RemindersAs with many ill children and young people, there is much conversationwith Fran about sibling interaction and support. In Fran's case, she is very close to191her younger sister, age 16, and her 23-year-old brother from whom she receivedher bone marrow. Yet their relationships are not without sibling relationalchallenges.One of the benefits Fran derives from talking with her mature, youngersister is that her sister will keep things to herself. \"I feel weird [when more peopleknow about her illness]. I guess I'm kind of in the center of stuff, and I don't liketo be because I'm very shy,\" she explained.Yet things are not always good between the sisters. \"My sister feels likeshe's being deprived of attention. She tells me sometimes, and I can see how shefeels too, and I feel bad. I'm not trying to be [at the center of attention], [but] I'musually the one they ask about,\" she added.Fran is also embarrassed when her younger sister has to take care of her,like when they go out together. \"I just feel like, weird. If me and my sister go out,and I'm having seizures, they want my sister to watch over me, and I feel reallydifferent because I'm the older one supposed to be watching over her,\" sheexplained.She is grateful for her brother's bone marrow that has kept her inremission for many years. Nonetheless, the issue is not without tension. \"He'sgoing to college and stuff, and even though we fight a lot, a couple of times hehas brought it up\" [the bone marrow he gave Fran] by saying things like 'Well, Igave you your bone marrow type thing.' I don't know, it's just kind of sad192because he can bring that against me and stuff,\" she stated. \"And my parentshave, too. Like if I get mad at my brother, they will tell me that 'he gave you yourbone marrow, so. . . .' I don't know, it's just really weird,\" she added.Straight-ForwardAt times Fran thinks talking about her illness \"makes it worse\" because\"soon everyone will know,\" she commented. Nonetheless, one of the persons withwhom she must talk about her illness is her primary pulmonary specialist.Fran thinks her physician is a \"good doctor. She's kind of straight-forward.\" Yet at times, hearing straightforward talk is hard. \"She said if I hadgotten pneumonia in December, if I had gotten one [referring to a lungtransplant], then I would be all right, maybe. And if I didn't [get a new lung], thenI was just going to die. I don't know, sometimes it just kind of hurts,\" shementioned.\"I come out of the office crying a lot,\" she said. \"I think about it [deathand dying] \u2014that I will be gone,\" she said. Fran suggested a better approach onthe part of physicians and others might seem to be a \"little more informative, anddon't like, say it straightforward, just tell them what can happen if you do or don't. . . just use a little bit more sensitive words than die or pass on,\" she replied.193La MalitaLa malita is the Spanish phrase meaning \"the sick one.\" That term and itsconnotation is why Fran does not like talking about her illness with her family.Yet that is how she is consistently identified.\"It feels weird, kind of, being known like that. That's a little embarrassing.That's a bad thing when a lot of people know,\" she commented. Fran explainedthat her mother consistently has to remind family members she is the mother ofother children when they only ask about Fran because she is ill.AlonenessOne might think someone as beautiful and kind-hearted as Fran would beas popular in high school as the homecoming queen. Yet she suggested such is notthe case. \"I don't have a lot of friends, just because I feel like I'm shy, and I feel alot different than them, so I don't feel like I should be with them.\" When askedspecifically how she feels different, she replied: \"just the way I am\u2014the way mypast was and stuff.\"Fran is especially close, however, to two individual friends she has knowna long time. \"He [referring to one of her friends] just tells me how strong I am,and he would have given up, and stuff like that,\" she commented. Fran said talklike that makes her feel better because it makes her \"know, I guess, that I'm doingthe right thing,\" she replied.194Fran spends a lot of her time wondering if she is doing the right thing. Shealso spends a lot of her time telling her two friends and sister that she \"likes totake care of myself most of the time,\" so that they will not continually remainbehind with her as she struggles to physically keep up.'I Prayed and Prayed' . . .Fran is no longer interested in spiritual talk, because \"God is notlistening,\" she said. \"I'm Catholic. I used to be really in to that, but lately I reallydon't have any faith anymore. I'm starting to give up on stuff like that, because Ihave prayed and prayed that I hope I get better soon,\" she explained. \"Then it justseems like every year, something else goes wrong. I feel like He's not listening orsomething,\" she stated.She continued: \"I'm starting to really give up on faith now. And I guessmy father is like, really religious, and he wants me to stay a Catholic, and wantsme to get back my faith, but I don't know, I guess he's not really helping me withgetting back my faith. We go to Mass, and to me it's kind of boring. I just want togo to a church that's out-going, kind of, that will get you in the spirit. He doesn'twant to do that. He said that we have to go to where he wants to go until we are18, and out of the house. He doesn't let us explore new stuff like that. I wish hewould,\" she added.This is an area of tension between Fran and her dad, and to a lesser extent,her mother. \"She's more easy-going about that, and she is willing to take us to195some churches. But both of them want us to believe in God. I just want to exploredifferent churches and different religions to see where I fit in,\" she said.Fran added that soon she hopes to get a car for her 18th birthday, possiblyat Christmas. Some of the first places she plans on driving to will be newchurches in the area.WithholdingIn order to be perceived the same as everyone else, Fran withholdsmedical information from her parents. \"Yeah, I have done that a lot of the time[not told her parents she was feeling badly],\" she commented.She continued, \"Sometimes, I guess, when I tell them it seems like theyget mad at me, but they say they are mad at the illness. That's why they get upset.But I don't know. I know when I'm about to have a seizure, they want me to tell,but a lot of times I don't. I just go along with it,\" she added.CostsFran wonders at times about the hardships her illness has placed on thosearound her. \"I think that it [her parents' relationship] would be better, because alot of times I feel like I'm just a waste-of-money-type thing. They have just spenta lot of money on me because of health stuff,\" she commented.\"Maybe if I had never gotten sick, they would still have that money andstuff. I don't know. I'm not sure. That's just something I think, because when we196get bills, it's usually because of my doctors and stuff, and I just think that,\" shereplied. She added: \"Yeah, maybe they [her parents] would have been better off,like had a better relationship there [the place where they lived before they movedbecause of Fran's illness].\"Stories, Strangers, and SatanismDespite her shyness, Fran has a story to tell, and she wants to tell it. Inmeeting a new person who had cancer, she said she would first share with her orhim her own personal experiences. \"First I would tell them about my story, and Iguess, just tell them that I will be there if they ever need me to talk to, just to helpout along the way,\" she commented. \"I know they have family, but sometimes astranger or a friend can help make things better in some ways. I don't know, Iwould just be there for them and everything,\" she said. Stories are important inFran's life because \"I like to read. It just helps to know there are other people outthere going through the same thing and stuff.\"Some day Fran would like to write her own story in the form of a book.She mentioned she likes true stories, like Jay's Journal and Go Ask Alice. Jay'sJournal is a story about a young boy's addiction to drugs and Satanism before hissuicide at age 16. Go Ask Alice is a chronicle of information designed specificallyfor young people concerned with physical, sexual, and emotional health.Fran battled depression when she was in the 6th grade. She continues tostruggle with finding her own way as a shy and somewhat alone individual.197\"That's what Jay's Journal is about [depression and searching]. He [Jay] believesin God at first, and he started exploring, and kind of went the wrong path, andstuff like that. I thought of that [Satanism], but after I read the book I knew itwasn't a good idea,\" she said.Two Roads Converged . . .Regardless of any spiritual path she may or may not take, Fran's short-term goals are to get her driver's license and graduate with her class from highschool. She hopes to be able to go to college. She also would like to volunteer hertime with the Big Brothers, Big Sisters program once she turns 18. She definitelylikes working with children and young people, like in her mother's daycare.Eventually she hopes to have her own family and children.In the meantime, she will continue to think about her life, and the choicesshe needs to make in terms of which roads to travel.Research WeightsWhen this interview was conducted, Fran was not only concerned aboutshopping at the bookstore next door for a Christmas present for her sister, she wasalso worried about bigger issues, like whether or not to undergo a lung transplant.In her spare time from schoolwork, she does research on the pros and cons of lungtransplantation given her particular types of medical problems.198Her physicians want Fran to move forward with the transplant. \"Yeah,they are wanting to [do a transplant], so I'll research that,\" she explained. \"Andthey are thinking of also doing another brain surgery [for her epilepsy]. I still haveto get tested for that. I do research for that, because they say if they do it [thesurgery], there is a chance that I will have weakness in my left arm, or that Imight be paralyzed, so I'm trying to do a lot of research,\" she commented.An UpdateAfter the first of the 2004 New Year, I contacted Fran via e-mail to see ifshe had made any decision on whether to seek a transplant. I also wanted to see ingeneral how she was doing. She responded:I'm doing all right. My breathing had gotten bad last week, but it'sdoing better. How are you? I didn't get a car for Christmas, andwas kinda sad but I did get a picture phone, so that was OK. Formy birthday on January 1st, I had a BBQ with family and friends.Then on January 2nd, I had a little get-together with some of myfriends, and finally on Jan. 3rd, I went to my first club that wasHardbodies. Hehe. It was fun and that was the end of my B-Daycelebration. . . . How was your Christmas and New Year's Eve? Istill haven't made the decision on whether or not I want a lungtransplant, but I'm leaning more towards yes. Well, thanks for thee-mail.Quiet ConsiderationsLife's handouts have put more on the plate of this painfully shy andgorgeous Jackie Onassis-look-alike in 17 brief years than most people experience199in entire lifetimes. As our interview on that day before Christmas drew to a closeand the java man announced the readiness of a grande cappuccino decaf, I wasacutely aware then, and remain so now, of the remarkableness of this beautiful17-year-old young woman, inside and out. Her future stakes and decisions areconsiderable.M. EnoughWhen I walked in to the small hospital room, 18-year-old Ryan32 wastalking to his young-looking mother. His mother said to me with a smile: \"I'mgoing to leave you two alone\u2014he'll talk more if I'm not around.\" With that, sheleft the room.Turning to Ryan I said \"Hello\" to a striking, congenial-looking, fair-hairedyoung man. He was dressed in street clothes and propped up on pillows, lyingunder a white hospital blanket. A worn baseball cap covered his head.Although he did not smile often during the interview, when we first methis long, angular face broke into a tight smile. Ryan had a quiet and strongcountenance.Nothing about Ryan's physical being suggested anything out of theordinary except the reality he was lying in a hospital bed in street clothes. He told 32 In this story, I have changed the names of the people I call \"Ryan,\"\"Dee,\" and \"Ralf.\"200me he was hoping to go home that day. A laptop computer was positioned on topof the blanket. He had been surfing the Internet.Ryan and I chatted briefly about what he was doing on his computer, and Ithanked him for agreeing to the interview. He shrugged and said \"No problem.\"On the surface, one would think Ryan had not a care in the world beyond that ofany normal teenage male.As I sat down and looked around the room for a plug for the tape recorder,I noticed an interesting item laying on top of a small hospital table to the right ofhis bed. During prior interviews I had observed a host of medical equipment likeintravenous fluid bags, hangers, oxygen units, beepers and so on\u2014almost to thepoint that such items had become routine to me over time. But today thisparticular item was something I had never seen before in any of my interviews. Itwas something I had never really thought about before until that precise moment:an artificial leg.MobilityCertainly I have seen quite a few people walking with artificial legs, but Ihave never looked at one up close or apart from its master. This particular leg waspositioned sideways on the table, almost like an old bathrobe lying on a bed.Nothing was around it. It was just there in plain view, or out of sight, dependingon one's field of vision.201The leg seemed somewhat strange to me at first in that the shiny longmetal rod that screamed high tech slid down into an old, worn lone canvas tennisshoe. This contrasting of the old and the new, and the shiny metal next to thetattered cloth seemed peculiarly sweet yet melancholy, for want of a betterdescription.Ryan noticed me looking at the leg. He asked: \"Ever seen a $40,000 leg?\"\"Can't say that I have,\" was my reply. He told me the leg was his. I asked him ifthe leg had a name, and he said no.Having become increasingly sensitive to the high emotional and economiccosts of being sick, and since Ryan had brought up the cost, I asked him if he andhis family had to pay for the leg out of their own pockets. He quickly replied\"No,\" thanks to the extensive efforts of his physician in lobbying the insurancecompany. His parents told me the same thing later on when I talked with themoutside Ryan's room. The expression of relief on each of their faces was universaland huge.Ryan watched me set up my tape recorder. He said nothing. During thosefew moments I thought about this 18-year-old young man who was wearing aworn baseball cap and who now had one long angular leg and a stump and a metalrod for his other limb. He began by telling me about his life, and how he came tohave an artificial leg.202A Sprained Ankle . . .Sandy-haired Ryan is an athlete who loves sports. He has played baseball,lifted weights, and participated in other athletic adventures. In fact, his initialwake-up call to physical problems came when he was playing baseball.\"I sprained my ankle playing baseball, and then I had X-rays for that.Then a month after that I started getting pains a little bit below my knee, and thenI had an X-ray for that, and it showed up as a tumor,\" he stated in a direct, matter-of-fact way. The word tumor immediately signaled to Ryan and his parents that hehad cancer, even though at first the doctor never indicated whether the tumor wasbenign or malignant.\"It was just a regular doctor's office, and they said . . . they saw the X-ray,and they said it was a tumor,\" he commented. \"So we pretty much . . . you couldmake the assumption that a tumor is cancerous,\" he added. \"We went to the onebone specialist, and they weren't sure, so they had to go all the way in there andtest it and make sure and everything. So yeah, it was cancerous,\" he said.Ryan's bone doctor said to him, \"Oh you got this, there.\" \"Yeah, basicallyhe tells it how it is, I guess. That's one way to do it. He doesn't feel sympathy foranybody,\" he explained. Ryan went on to say that his physician \"just has to do hisjob . . Osteogenic Sarcoma, also known asOsteosarcoma, which is how Ryan and his family identify the disease.Osteosarcoma accounts for approximately 5 percent of all childhood cancers.Most cases are caused by non-inheritable DNA errors in the bone.33 Although thedisease itself is relatively rare, Osteosarcoma is the most frequent form of bonecancer, found most commonly in young people ages 15 to 25.34 More than 90percent of the tumors are formed in the growing ends of the bones. More than 80percent of Osteosarcoma sites are found around the knees. Osteosarcoma canspread throughout the body.\"It's called Osteosarcoma. It's a bone cancer. It was found in 2001 in mytibia in my leg,\" Ryan explained. \"They took out half my tibia, and then I hadchemo for 6 months after that. And then about 6 months after finishing chemo, itreoccurred in my lungs. I had 3 lesions. Two of them were cancerous. Theyremoved those,\" he stated. \"Another 6 months of chemo. And then 6 months afterthat, it showed up in my tibia again. So this time it was amputation,\" he added.He goes on to explain: \"I haven't had any chemo yet or anything like that[this time around]. They can't give me anymore,\" he said. \"So they are going to 33 Wright (2004, n.d.). Oncology: Osteosarcoma.

Retrieved Jan.24, 2004, from http://www.cancerindex.org/ccw/guide2o.htm.204have to find some other treatment to give me that will hopefully kill it,\" Ryanexplained.SpreadingRyan continued to talk about the progression of his disease. \"They havealready found a few more lesions on my lungs. They are not sure what they areyet. They are pretty sure they might be cancer. But they are not sure yet,\" he saidperfunctorily.When asked when he will know for sure, he explained, \"Not until I have abiopsy or until they see them start growing. I have already had 3 chest X-rays, 3chest CAT scans, and they have all stayed the same size. They haven't grown yet,so they will have the possibility of them not being there,\" he added.No WhiningWhat is life like for an 18-year-old who has already lost a leg to bonecancer and may be facing lung cancer for a second time without the option ofchemotherapy? \"I don't know. You can't do anything about it anyway, so you justmake do,\" he added. \"I just let them do what they have to do. That's it,\" he stated.Ryan tells me his parents worry more about his illness than he does.205This or ThatRyan answered many of my questions with short, terse answers. My senseis that while he voluntarily consented to an interview at the request of hisphysician, he gets easily frustrated when the answers to life's questions are noteasy. In fact, he expressed that frustration with me. When I asked him in whatways he thought other people might describe him, he replied: \"I've been askedthat before, and I still don't know. I don't like questions like that because theymake me think. . . . I don't like questions where, it's not exact. It's like mathwhere the answer is this or this. I hate that,\" he said. \"It's got to be one answer,\"he added.Pretty BummedWhen I asked Ryan why he consented to an interview, he shrugged andreplied: \"I didn't have anything better to do, how about that?\" On this particularday he is back in the hospital because of an ailment similar to a collapsed lung. Itis the second time he has had this problem in the past 2 months. \"I don't knowwhat causes it. It happens to a lot of people who are my build, tall and skinny. Ihad it before last month. It could be from like a jolt, like getting hit in the side orsomething. Numerous things can cause it,\" he explained.When this happened the last time, Ryan had a chest tube inserted toalleviate the problem. This time they are simply monitoring him to make sure it206does not get worse. \"You can feel it. It hurts when you breathe in. Like yesterday,I started breathing in, and it just started hurting. And I felt it, and I knew it feltlike from before,\" he commented. When I asked him if he becomes aggravatedover having the same medical problems once again, he replied: \"Nah. You can'tstop it. There is nothing you can do about it.\"The other piece of Ryan's medical equation will be unfolding soon whenthe test results show whether or not the new lung lesions are cancerous. Heseemed unfazed to the point of being nonchalant about the possibility.\"Yes\u2014have/had. Oh, I guess I still have it,\" he stated.The only time Ryan remembered being truly upset about having cancerwas upon his initial diagnosis. His parents later reaffirmed how hard receiving thenews was for everyone. \"I got an upset stomach, like that, but I couldn't doanything about it anyway. You just have to deal with it,\" he stated. Later hisfather told me that Ryan vomited upon hearing the news. His father wept openly.Ryan continued: \"Maybe sometimes [I worry], but it's nothing big. I guessmost of the time when I worry it's about when I have to get the scans to find out ifit actually is it again. It's good to know, but if it is [cancer again], I'm prettybummed,\" he said. \"But you can't do anything about it anyway,\" he said again.207Day by DayWhile Ryan, his parents, and his younger brother wait on the latest testresults, Ryan takes things a step at a time. \"I just go on,\" he stated. He does notthink about the future in a long-term way, but rather he said he goes \"day by day.\"As the interview progressed, I became acutely aware of the generosity ofRyan's willingness to talk with me in the first place for whatever the real reasons.He is not a young man who cares to talk at all, including about his illness. \"I meanyou've already heard the worst that's already going to happen, so why bring it upagain? I mean, it's not going to help or anything. I mean it might help somepeople, but not me,\" he added with a shrug. He does not talk about his illness withhis friends. \"We're not really that close\u2014we just hang out and do stuff. Theywouldn't care if I . . .\" he said as his voice trailed off without completing thesentence.Strike ThreeOf all the adversities that have come his way, I asked Ryan which is theworst thus far. He replied: \"I guess all 3 times were the worst. He [the legphysician] just tells it like it is. He just comes in there and tells you what youhave, and what they are going to do, and that's it. Like this time, he showed me,'Yeah, you have a tumor, and we are going to amputate,' and that's it,\" Ryanrecalled. That is when Ryan became pretty bummed, and his stomach turned sour.208HumorRyan said sometimes he jokes about his illness, depending on thosearound him. He does not joke with his parents because they worry a lot. At onepoint in the interview he stated that he worries more than his parents\u2014then heimmediately corrected himself and said they worry more than him. I did not presshim on the issue. \"You just have to deal with it,\" he stated.\"I make jokes about having a stump now because it's funnier to joke aboutit than to whine about it,\" he said.Woo HooBefore Ryan's leg was amputated, he was in his freshmen year in collegestudying computer science. Because he was surfing the Internet before I arrived, Iasked Ryan if he used the web to gather research about his illness or talk withother young people with the same disease, as other cancer patients had expressedpreviously to me. \"I don't ever talk to anybody in here or anything. My parents goto the little web sites where you can talk to other people who have it\u2014the sameillness as you. Why? I mean\u2014they have it. Woo hoo. They have it. I have it too.That's how I see it, I don't know,\" he commented.For the time being, Ryan will continue to await more information on thenew lesions on his lungs. He has not been going to school because \"I can't reallywalk around the hills out there. Plus, I'm having the physical therapy, to learn209how to walk good before I go back. So that's basically it. I'll go home, andeveryone else will go to school or work, and I'll stay home and watch TV, surf thenet, play video games,\" he stated.Self-SufficiencyOne of the strongest components of Ryan's constitution is his intensedesire to be self-sufficient. At one point in our conversation I noticed his lipsquivering slightly, and I asked if he ever cried about having cancer. He repliedsuccinctly: \"No.\" When I probed further simply by repeating his answer in aninterrogatory fashion, he added: \"I don't think there's a reason to\u2014nothing to cryabout.\" He also commented that he did not think there was anything he had donein his life that \"I'm proud of.\"As we closed the interview, I asked Ryan about his younger brother interms of something he might find to be proud of in his life. Specifically I askedRyan if the tables were turned and something were to happen to his brother,would he care for him?\" Ryan replied: \"He's self-sufficient, too.\"OKPerhaps in my own desire to end each interview on a more positive thannegative note, and especially so since this particular interview was my last in thedata set, I asked Ryan what he would want people to think or say about him right210now at age 18, a young man with an expensive artificial leg. He thought for a longtime and then replied: \"That he's OK to be around, I guess.\"Did He Talk?As I walked out of Ryan's room and headed for the elevator to leave thehospital, Ryan's mother was waiting in the colorful sitting area down the hall. Agentleman sat near her two chairs over. I had seen the gentleman a few timesbefore that day walking the halls. His slumped shoulders and burrowed faceexuded sadness and worry as he paced the halls.Ryan's mom, Dee, introduced me to her husband and Ryan's father, Ralf.Together they seemed verbally and visually anxious for information about theirson that I was constrained by confidentiality rules not to share. Yet their primaryinterest was bottom-line basic, for they immediately asked almost in unison: \"Didhe talk?\"Ryan's ParentsFor the next hour, I had the unplanned privilege of sitting with Dee andRalf as they shared their own perspectives in dealing with their oldest son'sillness. I had not specifically requested the opportunity to interview them, givenRyan's age of 18. However, parental perspectives are critically important inunderstanding the holistic and familial systemic nature of communication duringthis unique time in peoples' lives. Thus I asked if I could record our conversation.211They willingly agreed. They were hungry to talk\u2014almost to the opposite extremefrom their son, who was verbally contained, albeit polite.Starting YoungDee and Ralf seemed incredibly young to have a son Ryan's age. Theyexplained to me that they married very young when Dee was only 16. They hadbeen married 24 years.Dee and Ralf cried throughout most of the interview. At the risk ofexposing troublesome researcher bias, I must admit I cried with them, as I hadbeen able to keep myself from doing in all but a couple of the previous interviews.I cried with them at times because they were hurting so badly, watching theirfirst-born experience cancer for possibly the third time with treatment doorsshutting all around them.I also cried because they individually and collectively seemed like suchgenuinely nice people. Self-described as opposites, Dee told me she was ateacher, and Ralf a rancher, thus his weathered skin and blue jeans. He struck meas a rough and tough rancher who would prefer not to have people see himcry\u2014but those days were long gone. Today he was sitting in front of a totalstranger crying like a weary baby.212Filling in the Blanks: The Strong ManOne of the most interesting perspectives in talking with Ryan's parents isthat without betraying confidences, they were able to help fill in some of themissing blanks in my interview with their son. After talking with them, I wasreminded that stories are simply snapshots of what people say or do at thatmoment, without the benefit of the immediate screen before or after.Ralf and Dee told me that when he was first diagnosed, Ryan used theInternet to meet others who had cancer, including a young female friend whom hewent to visit, thanks to the financial goodwill of family friends. They alsoexplained to me that Ryan had always been an aficionado of computer games, andthat somehow his gaming friends on the Internet became aware of his illness, andthey posted a notice to all those who like to play similar games. Ryan thenreceived over 600 \"best wishes\" e-mails from total strangers across the world,including Japan, Australia, Switzerland, and others. Ryan, Mr. I'd-Rather-Not-Talk-About-It, took the time to personally answer most of them. Ryan nevermentioned any of this in our conversation.Dee expressed some level of frustration at Ryan's willingness to talk withcyberspace strangers about his illness, as opposed to his parents or his brother.Nonetheless, she seemed grateful that he was talking at all. \"I think he keepseverything . . . , not that he keeps everything in, he just takes everything in stride,\"she commented.213That said, Ralf and Dee both marvel at their son's emotional and physicalstrength. They recalled a time when the family went to Disneyland for Ryan'sMake-a-Wish trip right after Ryan had been playing paintball with one of hiscancer nurses. During the paintball game, Ryan fractured his leg prior to theamputation. He said nothing about hurting his leg until much later when he waswalking around the theme park and his knee began swelling. \"His knee startingswelling up a little bit, and he was saying that it was hurting him. And we werelike, Oh my gosh, we were all scared to death,\" his mother commented. \"Andcome to find out, he had fractured it playing paintball, and by the time that he gotin [to see the physician], it had healed over. They said that was good though,because the calcification made it stronger. So when he broke [it], the crack inthere [the calcification] really helped strengthen [the backthere, yeah, unfortunately,\" she added.BrevityFrom talking with Ryan's parents, a perspective became clear as to whytheir son might be terse in his own communication. Despite talking a great dealand crying even more, Ryan's dad does not mince words. \"Basically, it sucksbecause what choice do you have?\" Ralf said through his tears, specificallycommenting on the amputation.He continued: \"That's the way he [Ryan] deals with it. He's always jokedabout stuff. And as far as talking\u2014\" Now Dee interjects: \"He's never talked about214it,\" she finished the sentence for her husband. Ryan's dad continued: \"I alwayswondered if he [Ryan] knew what was going on. I asked him one time. And I gotthe answer. 'Yes, I'm not stupid,'\" his father says Ryan told him. \"I said 'That'sfine.' I smiled and let it go. You know, I'm not. . . . It's just hard,\" he added as hewiped his eyes.Reading FacesScholars point to the importance of nonverbal and verbal cues inunderstanding communication interactions. Both Ryan's parents say wonderfulthings about the medical personnel. In fact, the staff has become extendedmembers of the family. Reading their faces has become an important and tellingritual.\"You can see in their faces that it hurts them [to repeatedly have to deliverbad news to Ryan and his family],\" Dee commented. Dee tells me that \"Yes,\" thestaff sometimes cries in front of Ryan when they know his cancer has returned.Ralf tells me \"No,\" they do not cry. Together they explain.\"No, not in front of Ryan\u2014with us,\" Dee clarified. Ralf added: \"Theyknow. They know. You can see them, you know, the doctor, it hurts.\" Dee added:\"It's scary.\" Ralf and Dee also said they try not to cry too much in front of Ryan.\"We try to be strong for him, that's true,\" Dee stated. \"We try not to [cry]. We tryto hide it,\" Ralf added.215Both parents added that despite their intentions, Ryan has seen them cryrepeatedly in the last 3 years of their medical journey. \"He knows we are worriedabout it,\" Ralf said. Both parents also tell me their younger son is concerned aboutthe situation. \"He's [at age 15] had to grow up the last 3 years, really. Becausesee, we live out in the country, and we have cattle and stuff like that. He'sconcerned about his brother. He's worried, but he's doing good,\" Ralf added.\"You know that he's getting the raw end,\" Dee said. \"You know, he's seen thatwe favor him [Ryan] a little bit more. You know, he's seen us. I've talked to him.He knows,\" Ralf added.Teenager PerspectivesRalf and Dee have similar yet different perspectives on Ryan's thinking atthis point in the disease process. Dee believes her first-born is stubborn, and thatout of the stubbornness and strength come his ability to always take everything instride, including cancer. Both parents believe that some of their son's strong andterse constitution is nothing more than the typical defiance of any 18 year old\u2014illor not.One of the most important components for Ryan in terms of his illness,according to his parents, relates to his wanting to be just like everyone else. Hehates being looked upon as different. \"You know the one thing too, the chemostuff, when he lost his hair, the principal, I went to see her,\" Ryan's mothercommented. \"She said he [Ryan] can wear his cap to school. All he has to do is216carry a little note. I told him and he said, 'No, it won't bother me.' He still says,'I'm not handicapped,' Dee stated. She continued: \"You know, he hates to use thehandicapped sign. He did use it, when he was going to college. . . . It was hard.That was before they removed the leg. It was hurting real bad to walk and stuff.And you know we would be in the car together. We will use it [the handicappedsymbol sign] so he doesn't have to walk so far, because he's getting used to theleg. He doesn't like it. He says: 'We don't need to park here\u2014park down there.I'm not handicapped.'\"Ryan's dad also commented: \"And then you get tired of asking, 'Are youOK?' He gets frustrated with us\u2014every 5 minutes us asking himthat\u2014sometimes\u2014yeah, sometimes [he gets angry]. been like that since hewas itty bitty,\" Ralf commented.EnoughOnce again I find myself amazed at the determination, vulnerability, andhonesty of 2 kind individuals. Their willingness to share their story and gut-wrenching hurt with a total stranger is amazing. As I closed the interview, I askedboth Dee and Ralf about their future. They are hopeful that now that Ryan isaging into adulthood he will become eligible for new medical clinical trials andthus receive different kinds of treatment that could stop his cancer from occurringagain.217In the meantime, they talk at length about their mutual desire not to seetheir 18-year-old son hurt anymore. They are worried about the future, and cryopenly. Their son amazes them in terms of his resolve, strength, anddetermination for whatever the reasons. They intend to hold tight to one anotherand Ryan and his young brother\u2014each in their own respective ways. \"There's noreason for this to break a family,\" Ryan's father said steadfastly.Talking helps sometimes\u2014especially for Ryan's mother. Crying isinevitable for both of them. \"Don't put off anything you plan to do. Don't takeanything for granted,\" Ralf told me. He also added: \"When I'm around him[Ryan], I'm better.\" Dee echoed the same sentiment. They come every day to thehospital and sit and wait.Ryan's mom commented: \"It's hard. I just can't imagine that we are goingthrough all of this. Once, OK\u2014twice, maybe. Three times, boy, it's like, OK,that's enough. You know, so we just think that we aren't going to get through it,\"she confided.The youthful looking mother continued with her sorrowful lamentation asif she was saying her prayer out loud to anyone who would listen: \"You know,just let him go on with his life. Let him live his life. He's only 18. He's juststarting out college, you know, trying. He's doing great with that leg. That's notbothering him,\" she cried.218Dee looked over at her husband who is crying openly. She said to me: \"Ipray all the time. I say to keep him cancer free, give it to me. You know, he[Ryan] has never disliked it. And that's one thing that he has never said: 'It's notfair, why me?'\u2014not one time. I've said it enough for. . . .\" Dee cannot finish thesentence because of her tears. I respond for her, \". . . all of you.\" She and Ryan'sdad both looked down and nodded yes. They had had enough.219CHAPTER 3:THEIR STORIES: OUR LESSONSThe preceding 13 stories represent conversations and interviews held overa 6-month period. They were conducted with approximately 30 individualsdirectly involved in personal healthcare situations. They represent glimpses ofindividuals and families in the best of trying times considering the sombercontext, such as when Arthur and his mom received good news for the day in themidst of a relapse (-Source: \"Good News, Mijito! What the Hell!\"). They depictsnapshots of weary and lonely souls in the worst of times, like Corazon who sitsalone in the butterfly room watching her son waste away (-Source: \"Waiting\").They represent children and young people who have a lot to say and whowant people to listen, like \"Unfiltered Harry.\" They depict children andadolescents whose voices have been lost or shut out between struggling parents,as depicted in \"Blistered.\" Many of the stories present images of seriously ill yetstrong-willed young people who are running their own shows.Many of the stories represent parents who are struggling in far greaterdegrees than their children. At a minimum, they represent parents who would giveanything to be able to trade places with their offspring.220The stories represent ordinary people who are living in extraordinarysituations described by most as the worst times in their lives. Yet the majority ofthose interviewed are moving forward with strong conviction and brave hearts.Some of the stories represent missed or lost voices. They are missed in thatinterviews could not be arranged before the young people died, or lost in that theyhave died since the interviews took place.Words come to mind in writing and thinking about these stories and thelessons they offer. Those words are presented below in random order:hopeangerdeterminationalonenesswearinessfearrelationstalkindividualitypatienceloveuncertaintyresolveGodgratitudeworrystupiditycynicismcertaintyconnectionspiritualityhumorlamentationweirdeuphemismintelligencesadness. . . and many moreAmidst the expansive uniqueness of the stories and the personal characteristicsand philosophies of the respondents, there are similarities. There are themes found221in the richness of the data. There are stories on top of stories. There are surprisefindings and absent expectations.Like life, there are many loose ends and uncertainties worthy of additionalresearch. Everyone dies. Regardless of how hard we avoid thinking or talkingabout the issue, the inevitable will come to each of us personally and to everyonearound us, most of whom we will not want to let go.If everyone is going to die eventually, why not talk about it more now? Ifwe cannot cast a veil of protective sanctuary around our children, why not learnfrom them? If \"out of the mouths of babes\" comes great wisdom, why not talk toand with our children about the unthinkable they may be facing? If our childrenand young people have stories to tell, why not listen?The overarching aim of this dissertation is to directly hear the personalstories of those youthful voices distinctly absent from extant literature. The storiesare theirs to tell. The lessons are ours to consider.In keeping with my methodology for this dissertation, thematic findingsfrom the interviews are offered in narrative style. Themes are generally presentedin random order with qualifying commentary.Glaser and Strauss (1967, p. 251) suggest the root of all significanttheorizing is the \"sensitive insights of the observer himself.\" The themes offeredare a few of the major conceptualizations heard throughout the interviews. Theyare among many general and more specific notions surfacing from the data. Using222Glaser and Strauss's cue, I offer these themes, based on my own insights frompersonally conducting each interview, hearing all of the stories firsthand,analyzing the data, reviewing extant literature, and reviewing backgroundinformation in keeping with the previously discussed research methodology.Themes discussed in order are: (1) acceptance and determination; (2)communication and 'straight talk'; (3) and undesired (4) isolation; (5) spiritual talk; (6) client control; (7) natural alliances;and (8) individuality.Acceptance and DeterminationAlthough the presentation of themes is offered in random order, the themeof acceptance and determination comes to the forefront, given its dominancethroughout the data from those who conceivably have the most to lose: the illchildren and adolescents themselves. For whatever their reasons or the historicalcognitive processes that brought them to their individual ways of thinking,collectively the young people with whom I spoke are universally accepting oftheir particular lots in life. As well, they are determined to make the best ofwhatever time they have left on this earth.Kubler-Ross (1969) identifies acceptance as one of the 5 key stages ofgrief beginning with denial and isolation (a period of shock that functions as abuffer against the overwhelming reality of the situation), anger, bargaining223(making pleas to others such as God or other forms of a higher being to try andforestall or avoid the loss), depression, and ultimately acceptance. Kubler-Rosssuggests individuals move in and out of the various stages. Going in to datacollection, I had expected to see evidences of all of the stages of grief at differenttimes from both the young people and their parents. Such was the case.However, what I did not expect to find was the universality and degree ofacceptance from the children themselves, even more so than the parents,regarding the distinct possibilities they could or would die soon. Withoutequivocation, the young people whom I interviewed were collectively veryaccepting of their particular situations. Such evidences from the transcripts arecontained below.Moreover, not only were the children and young people accepting, theywere determined to make the best of the bad situations they were being forced toaccept. The notion of determination is offered from a definitional perspective: afirm intention or a firmness of purpose.35 Determination followed acceptance inevery interview on the part of the children. In fact, not one of the respondents saidto me, \"I am going to beat this disease.\" Instead, they talked mostly in veryperfunctory ways as to how they were determined to live out their lives in the 35 Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language: The100,000th Edition (1971). New York, NY: The World Publishing Company:Times Mirror.224ways they wanted, spending whatever time they had left doing things with thosethey loved the most.This is not to say the respondents were ready to give up or admit theirfights were over\u2014far from it. Many of the young people were still receivingchemotherapy, considering lung transplants, or awaiting new test results withhope. Only in 1 situation had the young person, age 15, determined on his own tono longer receive treatments, against the wishes of his parents (-Source:\"Blistered\").Determination is presented here in a conceptual framework based on avariety of fronts. First is the notion of real time. This is to say that for the timebeing, the individuals were by and large accepting of what they had experienced,what they were experiencing, and to whatever outcomes were headed their way,good or bad. In sum, being ill had become a known and accepted way of living,and one that no longer required an emotionally or conversationally upbeat form oflanguage or behavior, regardless of how relatively bright or bleak theirpredicaments.Secondly, a comment is made regarding time in relation to how long theseindividuals had been battling their illnesses. Some of the young people had beensick for 16 or more years with advanced illnesses, some for only 1 or 2 years. Myinitial thinking was that perhaps I would have heard many more expressions ofanger talk and less acceptance and determination across the interviews had I225targeted children and young people only recently diagnosed. The argument couldbe made that such individuals may not have had time to become accustomed totheir situations, thus I would have heard less resolve.On the other hand, one might argue that for those children and youngpeople who had been sick for almost their whole lifetimes, weariness andfrustration could have given way less to acceptance and more toward anger andbitterness. Nonetheless, despite the wide sample of children and young peoplewith advanced illnesses in terms of lengths of illness, the two sides of theacceptance and determination coin were heard in every single interview in avariety of ways.Below are a few of the many examples pointing to the notions ofacceptance and determination in response to the general question of \"What isliving like with a life-threatening illness?\"If I go through my life thinking I am going to die, then obviouslyno matter how strong willed you are - you're going to. It's going toaffect you. So I just try to [stay strong], until they tell meotherwise. . . . And if God takes me young, then I enjoyed what I had. That'sjust the way it is.\u2014Source: \"Unfiltered Harry\"; excerpt 1(Harry, 20-years-old, has 50-50 odds, down from 70-30,for remaining in remission from leukemia,despite having had it twice)226I wish I [were] OK.

Of course, I'm angry, a little bit, but Ihave to deal with it.\u2014Source: \"Good News, Mijito!

And if I wasn't in thehospital for chemo, I was in there for pneumonia or low bloodcounts, or what's the word I'm looking for, Neutropenia, when youhave an unexplained fever and your blood counts are low. . . . Justlike it was my daily routine. As far as now, even if I do die, I still227have time. I would at least probably say a year or 2\u2014worse casescenario, you know, I'm open.\u2014Source: \"Unfiltered Harry\"; excerpt 536It's called Osteosarcoma. It's a bone cancer. It was found in 2001in my tibia in my leg. They had to . . . take out half of my tibia.Then I had chemo for 6 months after that. And then about 6months after finishing chemo, it reoccurred in my lungs. I had 3lesions. Two of them were cancerous. They removed those.Another 6 months of chemo. And then 6 months after that, itshowed up in my tibia again. So this time it was an amputation. Ihaven't had chemo yet or anything like that. They can't give meanymore through my whole body or whatever. No more chemo atall. They have already found a few more lesions on my lungs, andthey are not sure what they are yet. They are pretty sure they mightbe cancer. . . . You can't do anything about it, so you just make do.. . . You can't stop it. There is nothing you can do. I just say 'ohwell, I can't do anything about it.' I just go on.\u2014Source: \"Enough\"; excerpt 6(Ryan, 20-years-old, has had this rare form of bone cancertwice in the leg that was amputated, once in the lungs, andis currently awaiting tests to determine if new lesions foundin the lungs are also cancer)In sum, I was surprised by the notion of acceptance and determination from all ofthe ill respondents who were of the age to know what was happening to theirbodies, and the seriousness of their medical prognoses. I was surprised by theabsence of despair talk about their situations and long-term futures in general. 36 Note: Explanatory parenthetical references are provided only once perperson quoted.228This is not to be confused by the periodic presence of what I define asfrustration talk, e.g. not wanting to be viewed as being different from healthypeople who do not need oxygen, who move faster, who do not need medicalassistance, or who do not have to make so many visits to the hospital.Frustrated? Yes. Despairing? No. Determined? Definitely.The theme of acceptance and determination as significantly found in thisstudy brings forward some primary, basic questions stemming from extantliterature. As previously mentioned, Sprang and McNeil (1995) identify death asone of the most avoided topics in societal conversation. Thus the questionsurfaces: Why? Why are we as a society so afraid to even talk about death whenwe are physically healthy, when younger people who are critically ill haveaccepted their situations and are willing to talk about them in direct and almostmatter-of-fact ways?One of my underlying assumptions here relates back to the manyindividuals who expressed disdain as to why I would ever be interested in thisresearch in the first place. Several persons commented specifically that theywould be afraid to tackle such research because some of the young people mightnot realize they were possibly going to die. This research suggests, however, thatsuch is not the case. In all instances of my interviews, the young people were fullyaware that their lives might indeed be shortened because of the progression oftheir diseases. As such, as a result of this study I suggest that if the very people229who are living the unthinkable, the children, have already accepted thepossibilities of their own deaths and at very young ages already made significantdeterminations as to how they want to live the rest of their lives, should we not atleast begin to talk about death in greater frequency?One of the research questions from this study asks: \"What can we learnfrom hearing the stories of children and young people who are seriously ill?\" Oneof the fundamental answers should be that we should learn to take our cue fromthose individuals at very young ages with the greatest potential for loss. Thiswould mean all of us would begin talking honestly about death as an inevitablepart of living, including with those who are presently dying\u2014no matter their ages.While listening to the young people share their stories, frequently a visualimage came to my mind of children skiing. Seldom have I encountered a tentativechild skier who has been on the slopes for more than a few minutes. Instead, theytake a brief lesson, and then seemingly become experts who race down the slopeslike daredevils, sans poles or fear, leaving adults long behind.The analogy of skiing children to children with life-threatening illnesses isnot one of time, but of conviction. So many of the stories I heard were told withthe same resolute determination of a child skier. In answering all of the questions,the general response seemed to say: \"This is just what I have to do to get to thebottom of the hill, or to live my life despite having a life-threatening illness for aslong as I can go.\"230Fear is an important and relevant conceptualization in thinking about thechild skier who zooms down the hill. Is he or she afraid? One would suggest notgiven the speed and determination with which the hill is tackled by many youngskiers whom I've witnessed. They seem to know no fear.Yet extant literature suggests a \"universal acceptance\" of denial ofimpending death by adolescents that evolves over time (Freyer, 2004, p. 396).This notion is contrary to the findings of this study.While fear may indeed be a part of the equation, the stories I heard suggestthat fear exists less on the part of the children than in those around them, e.g.,their parents or other adults who may be afraid of making the situation worse, orrecognizing that the situation even exists in the first place.The content and tenor of all the stories I heard suggest there is no need forthe voices of seriously ill or dying children to be silent. We need not be afraid totalk with these individuals, or shelter them from their medical realities. In fact, ifand when we try to do so, we are not fooling them, only ourselves. Not only dothey know the score, they seem to accept it, and are determined to chart theremaining course of their lives, leaving the rest of us far behind wringing ourhands with worry over what to do or say.In fact, those very individuals who are chronologically the youngest andphysically the frailest, and with the most to lose, seem to be the most aware andopen. They are extremely cognizant as to the nature of their illnesses, their future231likelihood of relapsing, the emotional well-being of their parents, their future interms of how they want to spend their time, and the like. They are also willing tobe open in graphic detail about their anger, fears, dark moments, anddisappointments.All but 2 of the young people who were asked to give interviewsconsented. Most of the respondents were vocal, and willing to talk in detail,although some were recognizably more reticent in providing elaborate andlengthy responses. At a minimum we should learn from their individual stories,and take their verbal cues of acceptance and determination as permission to enterthe conversation with honesty and directness.Communication / 'Straight Talk'Scholarship suggests that productive communication is critically importantduring this time in peoples' lives. Effective communication is arguably the mostimportant component of caring for the dying because it presupposes an attitude ofrespect, candor, and collaboration that should begin early in the course of anychild or adolescent diagnosed with a potentially fatal or chronic illness (Freyer,2004).The notion of communication being critically important from the initialmoments of a disease progression was reaffirmed repeatedly across the interviewswithout exception. In sum, patients and family members alike remember in232specific detail as to what, when, and how they were first told about the diagnosesof life-threatening illnesses. They remember if their physicians were terse indelivering the news of the illnesses, if the physicians told the parents first andthen the children, if the information was conveyed in a sad or hopeful way, if theconversations were brief or lengthy with explanatory details, and so forth. Eventhe young people who were most reticent about providing particular details inresponse to certain questions about the future were more than willing to thinkback to the first time they heard they were sick, and what those messagesconveyed to them.All but 1 of the young people interviewed for this study preferred whatthey called straight talk in conversing about their illnesses regardless of theiraudience. The only respondent who expressed some form of hesitation on thetheme of straight talk in general created a demarcation in the use of straight-forward words, like death and die, as opposed to being straightforward indescribing the situation at hand by using facts and detailed information.One individual made fun of the notion of sugar-coating the situation indelivering medical news. Several respondents took great delight in conveyingsome of the many euphemisms used by those around them in place of the worddeath. They included pushing up daises, kicking the bucket, buying the farm,crossing the river, and taking a dirt nap. More of the ill children and youngpeople used the word death than did their healthy family members. One family233expressed a strong preference for smart, detailed talk as opposed to simplistictalk, e.g. a notion of a thumbs up/thumbs down response without benefit ofadditional detailed explanatory information.Specific words are important and have negative and positive connotations.The word remission is the most favored. No one talks of a cure. Words likequality of life, reoccurrence, came back, found something there, scans, newmedications, and seizures are difficult to hear. For the younger children (in thiscase ages 5 and 6), metaphoric words and phrases are important where stomachcancer becomes little rocks in your stomach and intravenous ports and theirbandages are respectively called choo-choo trains and train stations.Demarcations between past and present tense are of critical importancegiven the connotations they suggest. Some examples follow:Actually Marcus [the ill child] doesn't have leukemia. He's inremission. Well, he's still on treatment, so it's kind of a personalchoice on words\u2014ones that we think are important, and wecertainly emphasize with him. He probably went into remission onday seven of treatment, which most kids with leukemia do. Butthey still think that on a molecular level, he still might haveleukemia, so they continue to treat him for about 3 years. But theclinical definition of remission most kids reach in a month.\"\u2014Source: \"Intellectual Capital\"; excerpt 7(Parent of Marcus, 5-years-old, who is endinghis first full year of remission from leukemiafollowing a bone marrow transplantation)234Delivery is also critical. These young people are attuned to not only what is beingsaid, but also how and where. Pauses and sentences or phrases that start with uhsignify bad news. Parents being asked to step outside their child or youngperson's room signals the delivery of bad news. Telephone calls usually conveymore routine information, unless the patient is being asked to come to the hospitalright away.Several of the young people spoke extensively about the value of realistictalk as opposed to optimistic talk, e.g., being practical in what may or may nothappen, as opposed to creating a positive picture of the future. Regardless of theparticular type of talk being discussed, everyone in the interview population,children, young people, parents, siblings, and healthcare providers alike, pointedto communication as a critical variable.Below are a few evidences of the preferential for straight talk, genericallydefined based on the stories I heard as calling things as they really are:You know how people are like, Stay up, saying that it is going tobe all right? I always found it so corny. And now that I'm in theposition [of being ill], it sounds even more corny. I don't like itwhen they [other people] tell me what they think, and they tell mewhat they think like they know what is going to happen.\u2014Source: \"Authenticity\"; excerpt 8(Eduardo, 18-years-old, relapsed 2 monthsbefore the in the hospitalbecause of spiking temperatures)235They [the medical staff] ask me first if I want them to tell mestraight out. [He says that he does].\u2014Source: \"Blistered\"; excerpt 9(Oscar, 15-years-old, has had leukemiafor the last 10 years and is nowfacing brain cancer)Well, now, I think there is no other way [than straightforward] totell you that you have cancer because I mean, because you think atthe time, Oh gee, 12-years-old, real harsh, could you tell me in anicer way? How well or nice can it be told? 'Gee, hee hee, you'vegot cancer?' If you have it [cancer] there is nothing else they cando. Like, you're paralyzed, what do you do, you go to the doctor,\"Gee doc, I'm paralyzed, what do you got for me?' 'Why don'tyou take this wheelchair and roll your town?' . . . Imean, what the hell? If you just got shit, shit, there is nothing else.There is nothing else you can do.\u2014Source: \"Good News, Mijito! What the Hell!\"; excerpt10(Arthur, 16-years-old, has been a leukemia patientfor 3 years, having had cancer in his blood,spine, and brain, presently in remission)The theme of straight talk preferred brings to mind important findings advancedby Miller and Knapp (1986) relating to various avoidance strategies used in lieuof talking with someone who is known to be dying. One of those strategies, asmentioned previously, relates to being upbeat.Why? Why do we feel the need to consistently be upbeat if the verypeople who are ill prefer straight talk? Again I suggest we should take our cuefrom those who are at the heart of the matter, and proceed accordingly. If the236seriously ill children and young people have the wisdom and strength to talkabout their own situations with resolve and candor, should we not at least questionour own need to be upbeat as a way to dance around the topic of death?With that said, one of the respondents distinguished straight talk fromwhat might be perceived as cruel or beaten talk, suggesting that talk at thisparticular time in peoples' lives should be tailored to the recipients' preferences.This particular respondent preferred what might be called informative talk in lieuof straight talk:She's kind of straightforward [referring to her physician]. She saidif I had gotten pneumonia in December, if I can get one [referringto a lung transplant], then I would be OK, maybe. And if I didn't[get a new lung], then I was just going to die. I don't know,sometimes it kind of hurts. I come out of the office crying a lot. Ithink about it [death]\u2014that I will be gone. Perhaps they[physicians] and others might seem to be a little more informative,and don't say like, say it straightforward, just tell them what canhappen if you do or don't . . . just use a little bit more sensitivewords die or pass on.(Source: \"Quiet Considerations\"; excerpt 11(Fran, 17-years-old, a leukemia patient in remission who isnow battling a series of secondary medicalproblems such as diminished lung capacity,asthma, and epilepsy, and is perhaps facinglung transplantation and brain surgery)Regardless of whether the words are perceived as sensitive, straightforward,honest, euphemistic, or whatever, communicating is important to children andyoung people with advanced illnesses, and it varies by respondent, although237straight talk was significantly preferred. In sum, the young people interviewed forthis study consistently expressed a desire to be told accurate and authenticinformation about their medical situations in a direct manner. In fact, they pokedfun at what they perceived to be peoples' well-meaning yet stupid attempts to dootherwise.Unnecessary and Undesired External Sense-makingDervin (1989) points to the value of listening to members of an audiencein an effort to better determine how individuals make sense of their everydayworlds and how they see their situations, past, present, and future. She also arguesthat sense-making rests on a premise of discontinuity, in which gaps naturallyoccur in all facets of our lives for which we create bridges to fill in the blanks,both cognitively, i.e., by constructing them in our heads, and physically, i.e.,through coping with illness.The theoretical conceptualizations of sense-making strategies and theconstant need for filling in the gaps are important ones in the context of this study.First, one of the research questions upon which the study was initially predicatedrelates to how ill children and young people were making sense of their lives atthis time.The stories I heard suggest numerous different strategies both micro- andmacro- in conceptualizations. These include coping strategies, such as developing238a new or maintaining an already-existent close relationship with God that includesprayer and meditation; diversion strategies, such as preoccupying your mindaway from the situation at hand by playing computer games; and intellectualstrategies, such as collecting and analyzing the most-recent data relative to therespective illness being experienced.Numerous other general strategies existed such as being humorous orflippant about the disease, attending support group sessions, journaling, spendingtime on various charitable events relating to specific diseases, and reaching out tothose involved in pastoral care.Beyond listing out various coping strategies, there is no simple answer,however, to the question of how these children and young people who happen tobe ill, and their family members, are assessing their own personal reality. Part ofthe answer relates back to the notion of being resolved to what is going on in theireveryday lives. Most of the young people have told me in their own words that thejourney of sense-making is circular and co-constructed: that simply by goingthrough the motions of their everyday lives, they have been able to make sense oftheir everyday lives, as hard or big as the obstacles may have been.Dervin (1989) also speaks to a sense-making triangle conceptualized as (1)how respondents see their situation; (2) what gaps respondents have to face orbridge; and (3) in what ways respondents see the bridges they have made ashelpful for filling in those gaps. My purpose in mentioning the sense-making239triangle is to use it as a way of emphasizing the third theme found in the data:unnecessary and undesired external sense-making.In short, while sense-making as a whole may be important to the illchildren and young people regardless of how it is constructed, they are not at allinterested in other people doing it for them. This theme is not to be confused withrespondents' desire to obtain information from medical personnel on the status oftheir respective illnesses, as a form of physical bridging for coping purposes.However, from a cognitive and emotional standpoint many of the youngpeople expressed strong feelings of being personally and brutally offended byalbeit well-intentioned outsiders who try and make sense of their situations byattempting to \"sew up the loose ends\" for them. In fact, in several interviews, theyoung people seemed angrier about this form of external sense-making than theydid about being ill in the first place.For example, one 16-year-old respondent and his mother had thefollowing tense exchange during their interview:Son:And some of them [outsiders] try to give me advice butthey don't even make sense. [They say]: \"Oh well, thatsucks.\" It's like, What the hell are you talking about, areyou stoned?He goes on to explain that people often try and help him make sense of things bysaying \"things happen for a reason.\"240Son:People who don't really think, say that. Someone whothinks that quote is good . . .His mother:[interrupting him] Sometimes I say that quote.Son:No, that's stupid! [His mother tells him again thatsometimes she says that. He turns to her.] Everythinghappens for a reason? [The room then goes quietbetween mother and son.]\u2014Source: \"Good News, Mijito! What The Hell!\"; excerpt 12Additional evidences are found throughout the data as to this definite and intensedesire not to have others make sense of the young peoples' situations for them:I've gone through a lot of rough stuff in my life, the leukemia, abunch of other stuff, you know, I've had a pretty rough life. Andyou know, everybody says that Oh Heaven is the perfect place, it'sparadise, and this and that. That's probably true, but to me, it'snot. I don't think that it's the perfect place. Just because of the factthat, it may be the perfect place in the end, but to me, even thoughI have been through so much, this is the perfect place for me. I lovemy family; I love my environment; I love the people around me.Who's to tell you what those people [the people who wrote theBible] were on back then. They were on acid or something.Yeah, there's this guy, he's in the sky, I've seen Him. . . . Theycan't let everybody in [to Heaven], so there's got to be some [inHell]. Everybody always tells me, all you've got to do is ask forforgiveness for any bad things you've ever done, and you'll getright in. If it were that easy, Hell would go out of business. Thedevil would get out and become an angel again.\u2014Source: \"Unfiltered Harry\"; excerpt 13I'm not real optimistic. I'm pessimistic. I focus on the negative.Yeah, I've always been like that. . . . You know how people tellyou: \"You are going to be all right. God has to know\u2014you don't241really know what is going to happen to you. . . .\" I don't like itwhen they tell me what they think, and they tell me what they thinklike they know what is going to happen. And they tell you that youare going to be all right.\u2014Source: \"Authenticity\"; excerpt 14IsolationKalish (1976) states a social death occurs in many instances long beforean individual dies, during which time people isolate themselves from the personwho is known to be ill or dying. Several of the young people confirmed thisnotion by talking about feeling alone or isolated as reflected in the stories. Onerespondent had the following to say:I think they [outside people] keep their distance, because my momis like that. She is afraid to tell me stuff sometimes, because she isafraid of saying the wrong things, or she knows she can't doanything about it, except take me to the doctors to try to getmedicine.\u2014Source: \"Quiet Considerations\"; excerpt 15Silverman (2000) argues in favor of the development of a vocabulary for talkingwith each other and dying children given the shadow that hangs over everyoneduring such challenging times. In thinking about the notions of sense-making,social deaths, and the need for a better vocabulary to use during these times, againI suggest we listen to the children.242Specifically I believe the stories tell us 5 key things within the context ofsense-making and isolation: (1) There is little reason to isolate ourselves fromdying or seriously ill youngsters, given that many of their situations cannot getmuch worse. (2) Facing advanced illnesses or dying when you are young makeslittle if any sense in the first place. (3) The ill young people themselves will do thebulk of their own sense-making. (4) Healthy people are often offensive when theytry and make sense of things for people who are ill or dying. (5) There needs to bea better vocabulary or way of communicating during this unique time to minimizeoccurrences of isolation and offensiveness.Spiritual TalkAll but 1 of the collective interviews resulted in extensive spiritual talk,particularly about God or a higher being beyond that which is on this physicalplane. Some of the young people were angry at or disappointed in Godspecifically because of the situations they were facing. From a completelydifferent vantage point, 1 respondent saw himself as a Christian goodwillambassador anointed by God specifically because of his intense desire to leave alegacy behind by ministering to others while on earth. In so doing, he, and hismother, had anointed himself minister.Many of the young people questioned the existence of a God or a higherbeing of any kind. Such questions stemmed primarily from the reality that their243prayers for better health were not being recognized, or the repeated suggestionthat a loving God would not allow young people to die. One respondentspecifically questioned the reality that some people who are very kind are allowedto die, while others less worthy, like people who commit crimes, live.Spiritual talk was also significant in a majority of parents, most especiallyin terms of asking for help and comfort in getting through the ordeals currentlybeing experienced. Two of the family members talked with their children in termsof who would be waiting for them on the other side after they died. None of theparents expressed disdain or hate for anyone in particular, such as God or aspiritual force for the situation currently being experienced by their children.None of the children and young people themselves expressed the notionthat whenever they were to die, they would then be buried or cremated, and thatnothing else would happen. Instead, while ill children and young people may beresolved to their literal situations at hand, all but 1 of them were thinking andwondering in a more spiritual way about what was going to happen to them next.The young people and children in this study are frequently framing theirspiritual talk in terms of thinking and talking about Heaven and to a lesser extent,Hell. The notion of a Heaven was comforting to many. The possibility of Hell wasdisconcerting to a few.Several examples from the transcripts follow:Yeah, even though I may look like I'm playing my [computer orvideo games] or I'm doing something else, I'm talking to God244actually. That's my time alone when I'm playing my games. I justtalk to Him in the mornings when I'm just there. . . . Well, there'ssome stuff coming in the future. Next year I don't know the wholestory.

Whether or not the respondents in this study gainedindividual power through the telling of their stories remains untested. However, astrong theme found in the data served as an extension of the notion ofdetermination, and related specifically to individualized power through control.With significant conviction, a majority of the ill young people expressedstrong desire for greater control over their lives. They talked of control in terms ofwho made their healthcare decisions, what treatments were and were notperformed on their bodies, and others.248They talked of wanting to control where they celebrated their birthdaysand what goals they had for the future in terms of college, provided they weregoing to live that long. They especially talked of wanting to control how otherssaw them in terms of being perceived as normal individuals, not sick people whowere forced to wear oxygen or transport in wheelchairs.The ill respondents expressed dual frustration over wanting more control,and in losing what they already had. A few of the older respondents, e.g., age 18and above, repeatedly talked of feeling sorry for the younger cancer babies andpatients who were bound by parental control as opposed to individualizeddecision making.In several cases respondents described instances in which they controlledthe amount of information they released about their medical conditions in order to(1) protect their parents, and (2) better control the environments around them. Attimes the control issue created tension between the ill child or young person andhis or her parents.Some illustrative quotations follow:You know what? This is my body.

Bluebond-Langner (2003) and her colleagues atRutgers University are presently undertaking a study titled Decision Making forChildren with Cancer When Cure Is Not Likely: Scope of the Problem andRecommendations for Clinical Practice. Bluebond-Langner suggests that to datethere have been no studies on how healthcare decisions are made for children withlife-threatening or life-shortening illnesses from a social perspective that involvesall participants.Stories from my study showed young people wanting to maintain controlof their lives through the good and bad times. They are smart in knowing thepower of information to help them get where they want to be. They want to hearfrom and deal directly with their physicians and healthcare professionals. Theyare frustrated when they lose control, and often manipulate information andbehavior to help them regain the situation.Natural AlliancesYears ago Burton (1975) found that parents often feel compelled to evadetheir older children who ask questions about end-of-life issues. Based on evidenceobtained in this study, things have changed over time to a large extent.251Many of the ill young people talk openly and freely with their parentsabout their illnesses. In some families the communication lines were clear andopen. Many of the ill young people looked to family members for guidance,direction, and support. In other families, communication was severely strained, tothe point of breaking down at times during the interviews.Some parents actually looked to their children for support. One father andmother told me they were emotionally stronger when near their ill son becausetheir son made them stronger (-Source: \"Enough\"). Parents shared experiencesabout talking to healthy siblings about the possibility of losing a brother or sister.Figure 3.1 depicts the traditional circle of compassion and conversationfor the ill children and young people in the sample set. In this figure the term\"physicians\" is used to refer to other members of the medical team as well. Siblings Physicians Parents Friends Ill child or young person Figure 3.1. Conversational Flow from Dying/Ill Young People.252Kane, Hellsten, and Coldsmith (in press) argue healthcare providers mustunderstand the multiple dimensions of children with cancer who suffer and thecomplex set of relationships within their natural, e.g., family and friends, and theclinical, e.g., paid medical, healthcare, and social, networks. Kane and colleaguesaffirm studies that assess perceptions of support in an effort to diminish thesignificant suffering experienced by children living with and dying from advancedcancer.Relationships are critical. Based on this study, children with advanced orterminal illnesses were talking to their siblings and physicians first and foremost,then their parents, and then their friends. In one particular study, the respondenttalked about being close to her sister because she was one of the few people whocould maintain confidences, and who would take care of her when she became illwhile out with friends. This scenario was mentioned despite what the ill sister saidwas an ongoing perception on the part of the healthy sister that she was beingdeprived of attention (-Source: \"Quiet Considerations\").In many cases, the healthy siblings became emotional confidants as wellas physical saviors for the ill children and young people, having donated bonemarrow to their ill siblings. Such scenarios frequently strengthened thecommunication bonds. One family told of the situation in which the onlyChristmas present the healthy brother wanted was to be selected as the bonemarrow donor for his brother who had leukemia. \"It's Me! It's Me! It's Me!\" the253healthy brother shouted over and over again while running through the house.When the bone marrow transplantation was over, the first thing the healthybrother asked when he awoke right before becoming ill was: \"(Did) I help mybrother? (-Source: \"Praising Life: The Final Chapter\").Secondary throughout all of the interviews are expressions of gratitudefrom the ill children and young people for their healthcare providers, especiallyphysicians and nurses. Although at times they may wish the news being deliveredby their medical staff were different in content or delivery style, ill young peopleare very close to those physicians and nurses and others who care for them. Anexample from the transcripts is offered:I've been going there so long, I trust them. If Dr. Carter tells methere is nothing wrong, then there's nothing wrong. If Ted[oncology nurse] tells me he thinks that I'm going to get cured,then that's what I'm going to believe. They've just built up trustwith me. You know, everybody down there [the cancer hospital]has. They've made it to where, as far as I know, they've never justlied to my face. They've sugar-coated stuff in the past like I said,but, that's their job, they're supposed to do that.\u2014Source: \"Unfiltered Harry\"; excerpt 31The conceptualization of natural alliances within this context is two-fold. First,developing natural alliances with young people who are dying is a criticalcomponent for understanding and meeting the special needs of children who areseriously or critically ill. My argument is that we must align ourselves withchildren and young people if their voices are ever to be heard. Secondly, if254children's voices are ever to come to the forefront, we must not only hear directlyfrom them through their stories, we must also understand with whom they aretalking within their own natural alliances.From this study, I suggest the most important core group of individualssurrounding ill children falls within a context of natural alliances as opposed toexternal therapists. What this means in sum is that children in this research samplewho had advanced illnesses first talked with members of their own family abouttheir illnesses, most specifically their siblings. Beyond siblings they interfacedmost extensively with their physicians, parents, and friends in that order.Understanding this communication network will allow for the implementation ofimproved communication strategies to help lessen the distance between societyand this important segment of the population during difficult times of transitions.An additional expansion as to the implications of the theme of natural alliancesand its importance will be discussed in the final chapter.IndividualityRiessman (1993) reminds us that neither nature nor the world tells stories,individuals do. The concluding theme offered here is to state an obvious findingfrom letting the stories speak for themselves: they are all different.Some of the respondents themselves recognize the individuality of theirsituations. They are often hesitant to give advice or place judgment on how things255should be for others, in parallel fashion to the reality that they do not wantexternal sense-making imposed on them or their lives. A case in point:Question:Is there anything you would say to other children oryoung people with cancer or their parents?Response:Me personally? No. Because you are going to feel theway you feel about it. And nobody can make you feelanything. . . . You don't know how other people feel. Imean, they can tell you, but at the end of the day you arestill going to feel what you feel. So it doesn't reallymatter what anybody says.\u2014Source: \"Authenticity\"; excerpt 32(Eduardo,18-years-old, leukemia patientwho recently relapsed)Each of the ill children and young people with whom I had the privilege ofconversing, and their parents and healthcare providers, are just the same aseveryone else in that they are all individually different in their stories. They seethemselves as so individualized sometimes they do not want their story to be usedto try and make sense of other peoples' lives.Devers and Morton Robinson (2002, p. 245) point to the sensitivity ofworking with individuals specifically on the subject of death given that the\"qualitative researcher must be exquisitely sensitive to the emotional responses ofthe participants.\" From a researcher standpoint, I hope I have captured theindividuality of each respondent's story while providing the thematic findings.The simple fact that these individuals were willing to give me some of their most256valuable time and talk so freely about the uncertain and rough parts of their liveswill always amaze me.The stories are theirs to tell. The lessons are ours to ponder.257CHAPTER 4:ENVISIONING AN APPLIED PERSPECTIVEWithin the hearts and minds of these unique stories from ill young peoplelives a host of applied communication strategies. Individually, the storiesthemselves represent the experiences of many brave hearts in terms of their ownsense-making. Collectively, they offer a unique and first-hand glimpse into howwe can better reach out to individuals who are seriously ill. They also representsignificant opportunities to expand upon extant scholarship in the death and dyinggenre from an applied societal communicative perspective.As I stated in the introductory chapter, this research was not designed tosuggest a right or wrong way to die. Everyone does it differently. As an arguableextension, perhaps there is no right or wrong way to communicate with someonewho is dying. Certainly there seems to be no cookie-cutter approach that worksfor all.However, from this study's data come preferred ways for communicatingwith persons who are dying or seriously ill, including children and young people.In fact, if we will just listen closely to their stories, the youngsters themselves willtell us how to do it.258This final chapter offers several key applied strategies for improvingcommunication with children and young people who are seriously or terminallyill. The strategies are gleaned from the stories themselves and the themes of thestories as discussed in the previous chapter. They are distinguished betweenindividual interpersonal strategies and organizational strategies.Interpersonal StrategiesOne of the primary ways of thinking about preferred ways ofcommunicating and interacting with children and adolescents who are critically illbegins with one-on-one relationships. Several interpersonal strategies aresuggested within this context.Show Up and Be PresentMost of the young people in the data sample told of experiences of beingdistanced by many others, including members of their immediate families. Formany of the young people, their external hospital and hospice care team membershad assumed the roles of surrogate family members. Healthcare professionalswere often mentioned by the respondents in a context of friendship, such as beingattendees as birthday events and playing sports games together. In one particularsituation involving an older child, the person going with her to talk with a259physician about a lung transplant was not a parent or family member, but rather amember of the hospice care team.By no means am I suggesting this type of social support is a badphenomenon. Rather, it points to an interesting societal and familial reticence thatmay occur at times in staying close to those who are slipping away.Distancing was not always external. During several of the interviews, Isensed the young people themselves were doing their own distancing from withintheir situations for a host of reasons. Extant literature suggests this is relativelycommon with individuals who are in serious healthcare situations or who may bedying.The phenomenon of self-imposed isolation and withdrawal, which is alsoreferred to as social death, has been observed in persons dying from AIDS(Barrett, 1995). Within the specific world of children ages 6 to 10, Spinetta,Rigler, and Karon (1973) found higher levels of anxiety in children with fatalillnesses (leukemia), including a perceived psychological distancing from thosearound them that was preferred by the children themselves.However, a majority of the young people in general expressed anoverarching perspective in the narratives that they wanted to be surrounded bythose who love them. They wanted to communicate, as evidenced by theirwillingness to sit with a total stranger to tell their stories.260By and large the respondents were willing to give an extensive amounts oftheir time toward the interviews. In one particular case, an ill child and his motherwere facing a 3-hour drive home and the evening was late; yet they continued totalk extensively about their own experiences. Very little prompting was requiredin most of the interviews. In fact, in many instances involving group interviews,all parties seemed anxious to talk, which often resulted in individuals interruptingor talking over one another.In sum, the individuals I interviewed wanted me to listen to their stories ina parallel fashion to how they suggested people should go about being a part oftheir lives: by simply nodding and listening and being there for them. Theyexpressed a consistent desire to simply want to go to their favorite movies or torestaurants with friends beyond their medical caregivers who clinicallyunderstood their situations. They said they wanted to interact with individualsbeyond hospice care team members.39Within the worlds of these children and young people, there are timeswhen things cannot get much worse, short of unbearable human suffering ordeath. That is what the young people said to me. Thus, there is no need for us as a 39 Note: In no way am I advocating in favor of minimizing the need forhealthcare intervention medically, psychologically, and spiritually. In fact, inmany instances the young people spoke with deep affinity and love for theirhealthcare workers. My point is that while such professionals are delivering careon a variety of perspectives, they are also frequently assuming the roles ofsurrogate family members given the periodic distancing of actual friends andfamily.261society to distance ourselves because we are afraid we will say or do the wrongthing. Recognizing that adults can and sometimes do make things worse by beingcontrolling, dogmatic, paternalistic, or the like, the stories suggest a reality inwhich the worst of the worst has already been experienced.Listen and HearDuring data collection I spent a great deal of time simply listening to theill children. Generally I would begin each interview with a broad, open-endedquestion along the lines of \"Tell me about your life.\" In many cases, the youngpeople would still be talking on their own volition for quite some time into theinterview. Thus I assumed the role of listener rather than interviewer in many ofthe dialogues.This was not always the case, however. In several of the interviews, therewas greater hesitation on the part of the young people in responding, especiallywhen the parent(s) remained in the room\u2014despite my indicating a preference fordoing separate interviews. Nonetheless, even in these reticence interviews therewere rich data to be gained, especially when I continued to assume the role of alistener, as opposed to a talker trying to fill awkward pauses (and there weremany) with idle conversation.Goldman-Eisler (1968) suggests pauses occur in a variety of forms, andare unevenly distributed throughout the flow of conversation. Knapp and Hall262(1997) identify pauses as a form of nonverbal behavior frequently used to regulateverbal behavior.Prior to this study, I did not have a full appreciation for such insights intothe value of what is not said just as much as what is said through listening and nottalking. As uncomfortable as long pauses may be from my own personal vantagepoint, this study provided me with a new perspective on how much data andinsight can be gained by simply being quiet.The same holds true for communication in general beyond a researchperspective. Nearly all of the young people simply wanted to tell their stories, andto have someone listen. Some may have seemed hesitant at first, but many ofthem completely took charge of the interview in mid-stream. Others who talkedmuch less gave great insight into their situations and perspectives as a result ofpauses in the conversation. From an applied perspective, the stories themselvespoint to the value in not only showing up\u2014but also to the strategy of listeningmore and talking less.Accept a Premise of UncertaintySeeking to reduce the unknown through increased communication hasalways been an important theoretical framework in the communication field. Thegoal is one that should be ever-present in peoples' minds.With that said, however, the children and young people reminded merepeatedly through the telling of their stories that uncertainties abound in their263worlds amidst known and structured medical routines. They know to get up in themornings and head to clinics for more chemotherapy, depending on theprogression of their disease. Some of the teenagers and young adults drivethemselves, and have done so for extended periods of time. Some of the parentstalked of infants who were dropped off at the cancer hospital for more rounds ofchemotherapy. Much of their days are known. What they obviously do not knowis what those treatment therapies will do for them on a long-term basis.For some of the young people, the uncertainties are logistical in nature,e.g., they were not certain as to when and where their disease would take them.For others, the questioning was more spiritual and corporeal in nature, e.g., isthere a Heaven or a Hell or a God?In deference to individuals' religious beliefs, there are no concrete andcertain answers to such questions. No one has died and come back to tell us whatit is like, near-death experiences aside. No one can say with personal andquantifiable, photographic proof that there is a Heaven or a Hell or a higher being.No one can tell a child or a young person that dying will or will not hurt. No onecan honestly say from an experiential perspective there is no reason to be afraid.The young people with whom I spoke were resolved to their situationslargely because they recognized that most of their lives now center around a finalunknown outcome that might be close at hand on any given day. Over time, theseyoung people have become resolved to the certainty of uncertainty.264This is not to say they accepted everything\u2014far from it. Questions werethe order of the day. Yet finding final answers and reducing the uncertainty wasnot the expected outcome in the minds of those who were very ill. In my opinionthe young people asked questions more to talk through issues than to gain finalresolute answers that no one had to offer. Thus I believe the stories point to animportant strategy for all of us who are healthy: accept a premise of foundationaluncertainty that will not go away despite the best of intentions or the most perfectof interactions.Leave the Sense-Making to the Young PeopleUpon reflection about the interviews and a re-reading of the transcripts, Ihave become personally convinced that while society was effectively distancingitself from the world of dying children, they were busy figuring things out on theirown. The resolve and conviction of these individuals who have experiencedhorrible illnesses at such young ages will forever amaze me in terms of theirpersonal abilities and strength to make sense and order out of their own lives withminimal help from others.In fact, one of the key ways we may be able to communicate better withand hear more from young people who are critically ill is to let them tell us whatthey think about their lives and what may happen to them, as opposed to us tellingthem how to make sense of situations we have never experienced ourselves. Thereis a sense from listening to the stories that the uncertainty inherent in this type of265situation is much more tolerable to the ill young people than society, e.g., healthyadults.By and large, the young people talked specifically about periodicallybeing frustrated with their same-age friends for being insensitive and curt inresponse to the medical situation, e.g., \"That sucks,\" or \"It happens.\" Beyond that,however, what seems to infuriate the ill young people even more are the sweepingfuturistic comments they hear from healthy adults who try to make sense ofeverything for them. This strategy gives rise to perspectives for the use oflanguage and phraseology boundaries.Consider Specific LanguageTalking with people who are seriously ill or dying is important as theliterature and common sense suggests. We cannot always listen; nor do the illyoung people want us to remain consistently silent while they talk. In actuality,they seem genuinely hungry for the give and take of dialogue on a variety offronts.With that said, many of the interviewees told me of specific languagephrases that are troublesome and offensive to them. They serve only to make badsituations worse, as I was told repeatedly. While well-intentioned individuals mayhave a genuine desire to make things better by imposing their own sense-makingon those who are ill, the young people themselves want to make sense of theirown situations.266In the world of hospice and palliative care for dying individuals, the usualand customarily stated operational goal is to adequately meet the physical,psychological, social, and spiritual needs of a patient. Where doescommunication fit into that goal?Obviously we must try and communicate if we are to accomplish thatobjective. Yet should not communication be a stand-alone area of emphasis inserving those whose lives may be shortened because of illnesses?My suggested strategy here is that detailed consideration be given on howbest to talk with those who are living with advanced and terminal illnesses. In theCommittee on Palliative and End-of-Life Care report titled When Children Die:Improving Palliative and End-of-Life Care for Children and Their Families(2003), consideration is given to the physical, emotional and psychological,spiritual, and practical dimensions of care. Perhaps consideration should also begiven to the development of a language of rhetorical care. In so doing we shouldask those who are the most ill to help us formulate such a language.Several of the young people whom I interviewed began that process bynaming specific phrases or words that are offensive. Those words and phrases arelisted in Table 4.1 along with some alternative, more-preferred considerationsbased on phrases heard during the interviews and those I have created and addedto the list.267In thinking about this conceptualization of a language of rhetorical carefor those with advanced illness, important emphasis should be given to the notionof context. Bateson (1978) suggests context gives meaning to words and actions.Granted, some young people might not agree with the offensiveness of phrasessuch as those offered here given their upbringings, surroundings, parentalinvolvement, age, particular medical situation, degree of religiosity, and so on.For some, these phrases may be neutral if not comforting.Yet the point here is two-fold: (1) specific language matters to the youngpeople whom I interviewed; and (2) language should carefully be consideredwhen the situation warrants more than listening during this critical time in youngpeoples' lives.Persons who want to communicate more effectively with persons who areseriously ill need to consider what words and phrases they use in specific regardto the needs of their audience at the time as opposed to their own personal beliefs.If the phrases contained in Table 4.1 offend a majority of the ill young people inthis study, then why would we want to use those phrases in talking with them,even if we believe them to be true from our own personal perspectives?With that said, however, one significant qualification is advanced: like anyrhetorical strategy, a good one must be adapted to the audience. In some cases, aparticular language phrase or strategy labeled below as offensive may actuallybecome humorous and acceptable, if not comforting, depending on the person268who delivers the phrase and the relationship and history he or she has with theyoung person who is ill. As well, prescriptive language may at times beappropriate, and at other times, inappropriate, depending on context. In sum,shared personal experiences between those who are intimately involved in thecommunication interactions are the backdrop around which the language ofrhetorical care is offered. The experiences inevitably create the contexts by whichsuggested strategies are adapted for specific audiences during this unique time inpeoples' lives, children and adults alike.Table 4.1.

Instead justlisten. Stay focused on the present, not thefuture.)\"One must not question things atthis time.\"\"If I were in your shoes, I would have manyquestions too. I just wish I had all theanswers for you. What I know for certain isthat I am here to listen.\"270Table 4.1.

How's it going?\" \"Tell me, if you would like, what kind of aday you are having today. I would like toknow.\"\"Does it hurt?\"\"Are you feeling uncomfortable?-or-\"Is there something I can get you?\"Another word of clarification is offered as to the importance of who is doing thetalking in terms of what language may or may not be offensive. For example,several of the ill pediatric respondents themselves used the phrases above thatthey also identified as offensive language. The overriding distinguishing factor inthe determination of what was and was not offensive related to who was doing thetalking.For example, a couple of the respondents personally gained comfort andmade better sense about their own situations from believing their illnesses werethe result of God's will. On the other hand, they were also offended by hearingthat very sentiment as an assessment commentary about them from others whowere not ill.272A second caveat is advanced relative to the notion of being there, given itspredominance in the suggested phraseology. The conceptualization offered here isthat the person who says he or she will be there for the ill person is referring toself-action as opposed to any spiritual action, e.g., that God will be there.The strategy of language consideration can be extended into theorganizational realm in terms of additional training in the area of death and dyingand serious illness communication. Several additional strategies are offered froman organizational perspective.Organizational StrategiesOrganizational strategies are offered in response to many of the systemic,programmatic suggestions heard during the interviews on the part of the youngpersons, family members, and their healthcare providers. The strategies were allsuggested as ways to better respond to the needs of critically ill adolescents andtheir families.Increase Physician Training in CommunicationSeveral of the physician and healthcare respondents whom I interviewedtalked extensively about needing additional training on end-of-lifecommunication. The stories themselves repeatedly reinforced this need.273Extant literature speaks in great measure on the difficulty of deliveringbad news, especially when children and young people are involved. As well, afew physicians spoke specifically of the need for additional qualitative trainingalong the lines of narratives and stories as ways to understand the alliances andrelationships upon which ill children rely during tough times.One of the most telling observations from the stories related to the vividmemories from each of the ill adolescents and their family members as to the firsttime they were told of their diagnoses. As stated prior, respondents rememberexactly where they were, who told them, what date they were told, what day ofthe week it was, and how they responded even though in some cases many yearsmay have passed. Often the young people remembered very terse deliveries ofinitial diagnoses of malignancies. Thus, the initial communication on the part ofthe physicians remains critically important from listening to these individuals'stories.Yet physicians are among the first to express hesitation in their skills setsrelating to the communicative end of delivering care\u2014especially in terminalsituations. As the head of one pediatric clinic said to me, \"There is no concertedeffort to teach this [how to communicate effectively].\" Another oncologist talked274about \"missing the boat\" in terms of looking only at quantitative data as opposedto relationships and communicative interactions, including storytelling.40Throughout the stories, the young people described numerous instances inwhich they have become very close to their physicians and especially their nurses,despite some of the terse ways in which bad news may have been deliveredinitially. They rely heavily on what the healthcare workers tell them, and in somecases, do not tell them. Additional training is warranted from a strategicperspective relating specifically to communication for physicians and theircolleagues in the healthcare fields.One way of thinking about this matter from an applied perspective is toargue that since protocols exist for diagnosing patients, filling out patientpaperwork, making insurance claims, visiting patients during certain hours, and soon, should we not think extensively about how we talk with and hear fromseriously ill children and young people? From an organizational standpoint, thedata support a definite need for increased physician and healthcare providersensitivity training in this area. Developing a rhetorical language of care asoutlined above is warranted. 40 Individual physicians making these exact comments are left unnamed,largely out of requests from the physicians themselves.275Create New Communicative Training ModelsThis study showed the seriously ill or dying young people talked mostlywith their siblings. Thus, one of the key strategies from an organizationalperspective is to reach out to brothers and sisters in a targeted effort to learn moreabout what is being said, how communication is being delivered, in what ways therelationships work together, what communication constraints exist, and otherfacets of research that will improve communication.As with all research studies, there are new facts and data for additionalresearch that immediately come to mind. In this case, additional intervention iswarranted, starting with the siblings of seriously ill children to ascertain moreabout such relationships during these unique and changing periods of time. Otherresearch areas deserve further study as outlined in the following section.Future ConsiderationsRubin and Rubin (1995) suggest research projects are successful if theygenerate a lot of new questions and possible answers not initially deemedimportant prior to data collection. Browning (1978) claims one rationale for usingqualitative methods in grounded theory is the generous nature of the methodology276itself in allowing for new research areas not specifically considered prior to datacollection.41This study began with the following research questions:RQ1:What can scholars and society alike learn from hearingthe personal stories and narratives of dying children orchildren facing life-threatening illnesses?RQ2:What meaning and sense-making are these individualsconstructing during this time in their lives, and towardwhat ends?True to form, responses to these inquiries point to other areas deserving ofadditional examination. One overarching area relates to meaning through self-emergence stemming from social interaction. Or in the context of this study: howdying or seriously ill young people perceive themselves, how others perceivethem, and connections between the two that help form meaning. Two specifictheoretical frameworks are advanced: (1) symbolic interactionism (SI); and(2) identity.SI theory is a product of an intellectual movement known as symbolicinteractionism. Mead (1934) and Blumer (1969) led the movement as based on 41 As extant scholarship affirms, qualitative research offers a generousmethodological nature. However, within the confines of this particular researchstudy, I recognize there could be limitations stemming from possible effectscaused by the nature of the sample population. In essence, I was \"talking to thetalkers,\" e.g. individuals who voluntarily consented to interviews withoutcompensation, and who usually talked freely in response to questions. As well,although I am aware of only two young people who directly declined to beinterviewed, additional consideration should be given as to the possibility of277the premise that the self emerges out of an individual's interaction with significantothers. Within SI theory, communication plays a direct and key role in that itserves as the foundation upon which social interaction is based. In essence, theself emerges through social interaction stemming from communication.Blumer (1969, p. 2) specifically conceptualized symbolic interactionism as3 fundamental principles: \"(1) people act toward things, including each other, onthe basis of meanings they have for them; (2) these meanings are derived throughsocial interaction with others; and (3) these meanings are managed andtransformed through an interpretive process people use to make sense of andhandle the objects that constitute their social worlds.\" Symbolic interactionism,based on the teachings of Mead and Blumer as inspired by the writings of WilliamJames, John Dewey, and Charles Horton Cooley, combines with functionalismand conflict theory as the 3 key prongs of most sociology textbooks (Fine, 1993).One of the more significant domains of symbolic interactionism is thecreation of the self (Fine, 1993). Turner (1976, 1978) argues self identificationand creation stem directly from cultural and social trends. Denzin (1987) says theself is generated through rhetoric and story telling by oneself. Tajfel (1981)advances the theoretical frame of social identity in which the self is defined byidentity badges, such as nationality, gender, personality, religion, occupation,education, and others. These identity badges allow individuals to project their unintentional and unknown selection bias on the part of physicians who referred278own inner selves within certain social and personal categories while enablingothers to do the same as an ongoing form of classification.Within the context of this particular study, I presented an applied languagephraseology built on a notion of rhetorical care designed specifically for illchildren assuming a caveat of audience adaptation. Based on the findings of thisstudy, certain phrases and words can be used in ways to more effectivelycommunicate with critically ill adolescents.However, the situation justifies more than words and phrases. On a moretheoretical foundation, future research should examine how critically ill youngpeople come to define themselves and make meaning of their lives based on thosedefinitions.As well, consideration should be given as to how the self-identities ofthose closest to the ill young people are being shaped by such interactions. Inessence, SI and social identity theory offer ways to think about self emergence onthe part of children and young people who are ill, and how that emergence hascome about as a result of social interactions with peers, healthcare professionals,parents who may be in crises, and society in general. Again we return to thestories for validation, beginning with an initial observation.What made me think initially about symbolic interactionism and identityformation was a brief conversation I had with one of the referring physicians in patients to me.279Texas with whom I worked extensively on the project. Our conversationconcerned the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee and its non-interest in this particular research study.Despite having a reputation as the premier children's healthcare researchinstitution in the country, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital representativesdenied my request to interview any of their patients or family members. Therequest was denied despite my (1) being a personal donor to the institution; (2)being referred to the institution by a family member of a child who was stillreceiving services there; (3) willingness to complete whatever paperwork wasmandated, including a third IRB proposal if necessary; and (4) ability to travel toand from Tennessee on my own time and expense at their convenience. Noexplanation was offered for the denial.42When I asked the Texas physicians with whom I ultimately worked on thestudy why they thought the premier children's research institution might not beinterested, one person responded: \"They sell hope there. They aren't interested intalking about the reality of children dying.\"43In no way am I trying to slight or question the long-standing solidreputation of St. Jude Hospital as a premier research healthcare facility. Yet the 42 Author's note: The specific justification offered here is not designed tocastigate this particular healthcare institution, but rather give backgroundevidence as to why the research request warranted approval, based on the author'sbias.43 Name withheld by request.280notion of \"selling hope\" has stayed with me throughout the study. It raises aseries of deeper theoretical issues beyond words and phrases in terms of how illchildren's identities might change as situational variables change such as wherethey receive their care, and the ways in which they interact socially with familymembers and healthcare providers from other facilities with differentorganizational cultures.The stories themselves also spoke directly to a theoretical framework ofsymbolic interactionism and identity emergence in terms of how the children sawthemselves, and wanted others to see them as well. Time and time again theyoung interviewees spoke of their intense desires to have their social interactionswith those around them be a certain way.They were adamant in wanting interactions to be based on straightforwardand honest communication. They wanted to be treated the same as other healthyindividuals their own age. They wanted to be talked with, instead of down to.They wanted to be treated as \"people, not animals (-Source: \"Minister MikeForetells\"). The notion here worthy of additional examination is a perceiveddisconnect in how the children see themselves, as compared with how others seethem. In sum, the ill children and adolescents in this study did not definethemselves in terms of their diseases, but instead through their social connectionsand relationships, spirituality, dependence, outlook, and the like. This is281contrasted with others who seemed to define them more in terms of their diseasesand lifelong struggles.The young people also spoke quite forcibly and in great detail about howthey did not want their social interactions to be. They did not want to be kept atarm's length from those they loved simply because they were sick. They did notwant to be patronized or shut out from key decision-making involving majorhealthcare issues or even routine activities of daily living. They did not want theirdiseases to drive the ways in which they connected with others.Specific questions like the following deserve consideration:Ill Children Looking At Themselves: what identity badges do children with incurable illnesses wear inour society? where do the badges come from? how are the badges created? do the badges change with age? do the badges change over time as the diseases progress? in what way do the badges help ill children define themselves?Ill Children Looking At Others: in what way do the badges of ill children affect their socialinteractions with others?282 do ill children see themselves as marginalized in comparison tohealthy children and, if so, in what way? in what way are the identities of ill children similar or differentfrom others around them? to what extent, if any, is being sick a constant part of ill children'sidentities?Others Looking At Ill Children: do healthy adults and children always think of ill children inrelation to their illnesses? from a societal perspective can ill children ever be considered thesame as healthy children as they repeatedly wished for throughoutthe stories? how do the self-identity badges of those closest to ill childrendefine social transactions with them? are children with life-threatening illnesses always considered interms of certain emotional contexts, e.g. as being sad to the pointof being in complete denial of or immobilized by their illnesses?Others Looking At Themselves In The Context Of Ill Children: to what extent does society project its own collective identitiesregarding death and dying onto ill children?283 do identity badges change within a family structure when a childbecomes ill, and if so, in what way? in what way has society short-changed its understanding ofpediatric death and dying by not listening closely to the voices ofill children?Questions like these point to the need for expanded theoreticalconsideration involving SI, self-emergence, and identity within a frame ofpediatric death and dying. Prospective research questions might include:RQ 3:Following the identification of a life-threateningproblem in young people, to what extent can theresulting communication patterns be anticipated anddefined by symbolic interaction theory?RQ 4:In what ways do seriously ill young people constructtheir self-identifies throughout the progression of theirdiseases?One final area for future consideration needs to be mentioned. It relatesspecifically to public policy problems stemming from the myriad of complexissues surrounding healthcare in general, and more specifically death and dying.The Committee on Palliative and End-of-Life Care (2003, p. 85) identifiednumerous struggles that should be addressed, including \"trying to coordinate carethat frequently takes place at multiple sites (e.g., specialized referral center,outpatient clinic, community hospital, home), a large and frequently changingarray of healthcare professionals (e.g., generalist and specialist pediatricians,284nurses, social workers, child-life specialists, case managers), and differing criteriafor insurance coverage of different services (e.g., in-patient care, home healthservices, hospice, psychosocial services, respite care, out-patient drugs andequipment).\"The stories included in this research project identified specific problemsrelating to financial issues, e.g. how families are able to pay the healthcare billsthey constantly incur, understanding the regulatory requirements in order toreceive Medicaid and other governmental assistance, the lack of outsideorganizations to share in the costs, the ease in obtaining accurate andunderstandable information on diseases, language barriers, the need for additionaltraining, and the like. On a more global and public policy frame, several of therespondents, adolescents and healthcare providers alike called for additionalpolicy intervention by national, state and local policy leaders relating to bothprogrammatic and monetary issues associated with end-of-life care.ConclusionCarverhill (2002) suggests becoming a participant observer of people andtheir dying is a narrative all its own. Bartholome (1993, p. 31) offers thefollowing in specifically defining respect for dying children. The commentarycaptures a good but limited starting point for further research in this area:285Respect for dying children involves a series of challenges for theirparents and their healthcare providers. It means a willingness toacknowledge our limited capacity to rescue them or protect themfrom death. It demands that the healthcare providers accept theresponsibility for identifying terminally ill children. It means awillingness to respond to their experiences and to be truthful and toassist them in developing their own understanding of the realitythey face. It demands that we respect their capacity for autonomyby allowing them to participate actively in making decisions aboutappropriate care. And it means supporting them and their copingstrategies as they attempt to maintain control over their lives to theend. It means, above all, a willingness and ability to trust that theycan manage their own dying at least as well as big people.In order for us to fully appreciate the infinite wisdom that comes from the mouthsof babes, we must put them center stage at the best and worst times of their lives.We must acknowledge that respect and compassion for dying adolescentsinvolves a series of challenges not only for their parents and healthcare providers,but also and most especially for the children and young people themselves whoare rising to the occasion in their own individualized ways.Many of the young people whom I interviewed were coping better thantheir parents. Their voices, and the voices of those they represent, deserve to beheard in conversations about life and death, as hard as that may be for all of us.From the youngest among us comes sage wisdom about unthinkable life events.Kaufman (2000) suggests medical practice does not allow for a transition,a process, or a passage between life and death. Yet everyone dies. Perhaps now isthe time to truly begin listening to what children and young people who are dying286or experiencing advanced illness have to say about an inescapable time in all ourlives.287APPENDICESAPPENDIX A: AGENCY/ENTITY CONTACTLISTINGFollowing is a list of agencies and entities I contacted in my search forrespondents for this study.
