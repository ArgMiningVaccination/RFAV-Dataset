Acknowledgments AAckknow lleddggmenttsHealthy Partnerships | ix Healthy Partnerships | ix Health care systems across Africa urgently need improvement. Despite concerted efforts, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are not on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. If the region is to realize its considerable prom- ise and potential in the coming years, more Africans need to have access to affordable, good quality health services. Yet public resources for health are scarce. In fact, the private health sector now provides half of all health services in the region to rich and poor alike. Private health care providers are often the only option for people living in rural regions and poor urban slums. In most of Sub-Saharan Africa, oversight of these health care providers is minimal, if it exists at all. National governments across the region and international partners are increasingly recognizing that one of the key elements to better health service delivery is improving the way in which governments and the private health sector work together. More effec- tive engagement between the public and private health care sectors in terms of better policies, regulations, information sharing, and nancing mechanisms, including for the poor, would improve the performance of African health systems. It would save lives. I am therefore glad to present to our clients, partners, and other stakeholders this report on \"Healthy Partnerships.\" It is the rst systematic and standardized assessment of government engagement with the private health sector. Along with an assessment, it also offers guidelines for improving the way public and private health sectors work together. I am con dent this work will inspire practical discussions and tangible reforms, which will increase the private sector contribution to public health and cre-ate investment opportunities aligned with national health goals. IFC and the World Bank look forward to supporting these reforms and investments through our 'Health in Africa' initiative and through our work more generally. I wish to thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for their support, and to acknowledge the contributions of the RAND Corporation and the Economist Intel- ligence Unit. I congratulate the project team and our colleagues working in the region for their contributions and partnership in this effort. Their collaboration with external partners and clients throughout the development of this report has brought together public and private perspectives, contributing to a deeper understanding of how we can make quality health care more accessible for all Africans.

The public sector should not be expected to shoulder the bur- den of directly providing the needed services alone, nor can it, given the current realities of African health systems. Therefore to achieve nec-essary improvements, governments will need to rely more heavily on the private health sector. i Indeed, private providers already play a signi - cant role in the health sector in Africa and are expected to continue to play a key role, and pri-vate providers serve all income levels across Sub-Saharan Africa's health systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) and others have identi ed improvements in the way governments interact with and make use of their private health sectors as one of the key ingredients to health sys-tems improvements. 1 Across the African region, many ministries of health are actively seeking to increase the contributions of the private health sector. However, relatively little is known about the details of engagement; that is, the roles and responsibilities of the players, and what works and what does not. A better understanding of the ways that governments and the private health sector work together and can work together more effectively is needed. This Report assesses and compares the ways in which African governments are engaging with their private health sectors. Engagement is de ned, for the purposes of this Report, to mean the delib- erate, systematic collaboration of the government and the private health sector according to national health priorities, beyond individual interventions and pro-grams. With effective engagement, one of the main constraints to better private sector contributions can be addressed, which in turn should improve the performance of health systems overall. Collaboration between the government and the private health sector is nothing new in Africa. Private providers, especially faith-based organiza-tions (FBOs), have been serving African commu-nities for decades, often predating political independence. But engagement between govern-ments and self- nancing or for-pro t ii providers occurs far less often, even though the clear major-ity of private providers are self- nancing. For this Report, a new framework was devel- oped to assess the level of engagement between the public health authorities and private sector provid-ers. A team of researchers collected data through interviews, supplemented by desk research, in 45 Sub-Saharan African countries. More than 750 in-person interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in each country: senior government of cials; private sector representatives, including practicing doctors and nurses; and independent experts. The results highlight those places where public-private collaboration is working well and those where it is not. The framework and its indica-tors also suggest strategies to enhance contributions by the private health sector. As stewards of the health care system, govern- ments should be seeking ways to leverage available resources, thereby improving quality and access. Our research starts with three observations: \u0081 Africa's health systems need to be improved. \u0081 The private health sector is too large to ignore.\u0081 Engagement can improve the use and effec- tiveness of existing resources. Executive Summary i. The term \"private health sector,\" as used in this Report, includes all nonstate providers. ii. For-pro t and self- nancing are used Execu tiive Summar yyyxiv | Healthy PartnershipsThe poor performance of many of Africa's national health care systems is sobering. Less than 50 per-cent of all births in the region take place in a health care facility, and only about half the chil-dren with serious infections are treated in clinics or hospitals. 2 These averages mask signi cant dis- parities in access: women in the top wealth quin-tile are nearly six times more likely to deliver their baby in a health care facility than women in the lowest quintile. 3 Where pregnant women have access to prenatal care, it is often of poor quality. The private sector is part of the answer, if only because of its size. More than half of all health care spending in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from private parties, 4 and private providers are respon- sible for delivering at least half the services.5 This is true for the poor and the rich, and for urban and rural populations alike. 6 Many patients choose private over public providers because they prefer the care, and others do so because care is not avail-able from public providers. Although the quality of private services can range from very poor to very good, it is comparable to what is provided by public providers, often because many doctors and nurses work in both sectors. The private health sector not only provides additional access to care, but also is a source of much-needed capital, com-petition among providers, management skills for operating complex systems like hospitals, and innovation and fl exibility in health care delivery. Harnessing these potential contributions fully is the critical challenge. The goal of this Report is not to argue for a greater or smaller role of the private sector in health care, but for a closer collaboration between the public and private sectors and a stronger con-tribution of the private sector toward national health priorities. The policies and practices sug-gested here can improve public-private engage-ment. The private sector must be an integral part of any solution to providing more equitable health care to all people, since the public sector cannot solve the problem by itself. An example of a mis-conception about equitable health care is that it is sometimes believed that public spending on health care mostly bene ts the poor. However, it is fre- quently the relatively wealthy, not the poor, who disproportionately bene t from public spending. The disparity is especially pronounced in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the poorest 20 percent ben-e t from only 13 percent of public money for health care compared to almost 29 percent of pub-lic money bene ting the richest 20 percent. 7 When the public and private health sectors work together, outcomes tend to improve. The lit-erature on maternal and child care shows that closer coordination between the public and pri-vate sectors has improved access to family plan-ning and increased the participation of skilled attendants during childbirth, both of which have saved lives. 8 Contracting or purchasing services from the private sector, provided it is done well, can also be effective. Here, too, the results from maternal and neonatal programs have been par-ticularly impressive. Findings Although public-private collaboration is not a new concept, the framework used in this Report to measure it is. Based on a public economics framework, we identi ed ve domains that col- lectively constitute and dialogue \u0081 Information exchange\u0081 Regulation\u0081 Financing\u0081 Public provision of services. There is more engagement with the nonpro t sec- tor than with self- nancing providers across all domains in all countries. Governments typically trust FBOs, the dominant form of nonpro t pro- viders, because of their social aims and their com-mitment to the public good. The engagement is also high because FBOs are relatively well orga-nized and often predate the establishment of the public health systems. In many countries, FBO facilities are indistinguishable from public facilities and some serve as public reference hospitals. The close collaboration between the public health sec-tor and FBOs is not without its challenges, how-ever. Shortcomings in each of the ve domains frequently reduce the effectiveness of the engage- Healthy Partnerships | xv Individual indicators Results for 45 countries Policy exists for engaging with PHS De facto implementation of engagement policy (1-4) Formalized mechanism for dialogue with PHS De facto dialogue (1-4) FIGURE x.1 Summary of Results for Policy and Dialogue and Information Exchangement with the FBOs. The often-blurred lines between FBOs and public facilities make the stan-dardized assessment and comparison of engage-ment impractical. Therefore, the key ndings and conclusions for each domain, described below, refer to the engagement between the government and the for-pro t or self- nancing providers\u2014the clear majority of the private health sector. Policy and dialogue The policy and dialogue domain concerns the pri-vate sector policy framework on paper and in practice, as well as the level of dialogue between the public and private sectors. Policy and dialogue between the government and the private health sector are the foundations of effective engage-ment; they set out roles and responsibilities of the different actors. A functioning dialogue with pri-vate providers is a sign that the government is aware of their presence, takes them into account, and views them as partners. While more than 85 percent of the countries we studied have an of cial policy of working with the private health sector, the majority of Sub-Saharan African countries do not actually implement the policy. The level of dialogue between the government and the private health sector is low across the region. However, there are a growing number of countries in which a dialogue is being (re-)initiated as a necessary rst step in improving engagement. In Ghana, for example, the level of engagement between the government and the private health sector has greatly improved since the existing private health sector policy was revived through a new forum for dialogue. The private sector, in turn, has responded by forming an umbrella organization of private providers, a critical step. Indeed, beyond Ghana, the organization of the private sector itself is critical in establishing a dialogue, but is lacking in most countries. See gure x.1 for a regional summary of the results for policy and dialogue and information exchange. For more details on the individual indicators, refer to Appendix 4 of the Report. Information exchange The information exchange domain concerns infor-mation fl ows between the public and private sec- tors, and private sector inclusion in national health management information systems and disease sur-veillance.

Information systems remain incomplete if they do not include the private health sector. This is especially pertinent if the pri-vate health sector is providing a large proportion of health services. Having separate or designated information systems for the private health sector on its own is neither necessary nor more effective. Information exchange is weak in most countries, with a majority of countries lacking basic elements of a well-functioning system. Despite existing legal requirements for the private sector to provide data to the Ministry of Health, the data seldom reach the government. There are somewhat higher levels of inclusion of the private health sector in disease surveillance programs. Particularly during severe disease outbreaks, governments often reach out aggressively to private health providers and include them in of cial programs. The few countries that do relatively well in this domain, such as Burkina Faso and Rwanda, keep the private sector well informed and include pri-vate providers in existing public health sector information channels, such as for health manage-ment information systems data.Regulation The regulation domain focuses on the ability of the government to design and implement a regu-latory framework for the private health sector. The registration of private health facilities, as a basic precondition for effective planning in the health system, falls under regulation. Among the ve domains, governments tend to overemphasize regulation, without properly accounting for the lacking enforcement capacity. The registration of private providers is poor in most countries, which leaves a critical gap in the understanding of \"who does what\" in the health system. In addition, regulations are often inappro-priate or outdated and enforcement is weak across the region. Overly complex frameworks that are contradictory or that cannot be implemented as intended create uncertainty and opportunities for arbitrary enforcement. Even private providers complain about the lack of consistent regulatory oversight, which allows low-quality providers to continue to operate. It is critical for governments, but also for the private health sector, to under-stand that self-regulation can substitute for enforcement by the government. A notable exception to the weak regulatory frameworks across the region can be found in FIGURE x.2 Summary of Results for Regulation Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.

Healthy Partnerships | xvii South Africa, where the private health sector is considered one of the best performing in the world and operates in a highly regulated environ-ment, including strict enforcement. Aside from the fact that the capacity of both government and private health organizations is high, the private sector is primarily funded through insurance. This builds in a strong incentive for compliance with rules and regulations. See gure x.2 for a regional summary of the results. Financing The nancing domain covers the revenues that are actually or potentially available to the private health sector and the government's infl uence of such funds through various mechanisms. The key to nancing is to ensure that there is a mechanism that allows poor people to have access to services, and that public funds buy value for money from either public or private services that compete on a level playing eld. This principle of strategic pur- chasing (buying services from the best providers regardless of ownership) is especially important in countries where the private sector is large. As a proxy for whether governments are com- mitted to improving the effectiveness of public funds, the existence of any ongoing contracts to pay private providers is used. The existence of any nancial incentives speci c to private health sec- tor facilities serves as a proxy for whether the gov-ernment seeks to improve the investment climate for the private health sector. Finally, and perhaps most important, the level of private provider cov-erage by health insurance is used as a proxy to assess whether a signi cant part of the population can access the private health sector without hav-ing to pay out-of-pocket. The Report nds that a third of Sub-Saharan Africa governments contract with self- nancing providers for services, and half of those govern-ments also offer nancial incentives. Seven coun- tries offer nancial incentives but no contracts. The level of health insurance coverage that would allow reimbursement for treatment received in a private facility is low; in most African countries, it is available to less than 15 percent of the popula-tion. But the levels of health insurance coverage are growing. There is a strong interest in expanding such coverage and a clear momentum to do so. In several countries, for example, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda, the introduction of an expanded (public) insurance scheme is at an advanced stage. See gure x.3 for a regional sum- mary of the results in nancing and public provi- sion of services.

Through stra-tegic allocation of resources, governments can use public production to complement, crowd out, or build a supporting environment for private health care markets. In addition, the public sector can ensure the availability of basic services and insti- tutional support. Like the private sector in gen-eral, the private health sector also depends on infrastructure services such as water, electricity, and good roads. In many countries, there is some evidence that governments and the private sector can collabo-rate relatively well on disease and immunization programs. In addition, there is some form of patient referral between the private and public sectors in most countries. These instances of collaboration, sometimes prompted by the requirements of donor programs (for example, requirements to make donated medicine also available to patients in the private health sector), on narrow issues hold some promise for engagement at the sys-tems level. Action plan While this Report focuses on the technical aspects of engagement, the importance of the political process cannot be overstated. Sophisticated and technically appropriate solutions are useless if they are not translated into concrete action by the stakeholders. Indeed, the application of the frame-work proposed here, and the implementation of changes in policy and practice, is a political chal-lenge rather than a technical one. All stakehold-ers\u2014governments, the private health sector, but also donor and third-party organizations\u2014are impacted by such reform. Key actions needed include the following: \u0081 For governments, a rst step in the short term is to avoid interventions that are unnecessarily burdensome for the private health sector. Healthy Partnerships | xix Beyond that basic step, an ongoing dialogue with the private sector is needed, as is a basic understanding of its size and activities: who is in business, which services they are providing, and where they are located. A better under-standing of what type of private providers are serving the poor, for example, is critical for the success of public health programs. In the longer term, review and reform of the key policy instruments are needed, particularly of regula-tion. Often it will be a matter of simplifying the rules and bringing them into alignment with what can be enforced. Especially for instruments that are technically and politically dif cult, such as nancing, it is advisable to start with relatively simple, but concrete, steps. That way the necessary capacity and experi-ence can be developed over time. \u0081 For the private health sector, forming credible associations or representative organizations is an essential rst step. Being well represented will enable a productive dialogue with the gov-ernment, including the identi cation of priori- ties and capacities. An especially important area for collaboration in the longer term is quality of care. Provider networks, improve-ments of internal quality control in clinical practice, and business management training are all effective ways for the private sector to improve the quality of their services. \u0081 Donors are asked to support engagement at all levels and to include the private health sector in intervention programs, where appropriate. Donor funding and project designs should not be based on preconceived notions of the size, ability, and motivations of the private health sector.\u0081 Third-party organizations, such as insurance agencies and civil society organizations, can play an important role in facilitating and supporting engagement and providing support to the pri-vate health sector to upgrade its operations. With respect to the analytical work, the action plan going forward is to build on this important rst step in understanding engagement in a more systematic way. What lies ahead is the further development of the framework for assessing engagement and its application in areas that were beyond the scope of this Report. Further work toward how public-private engagement can be improved will bene t African health systems and their patients. Designated resources are available for stake- holders interested in taking an active role in the improvement of public-private engagement. A toolkit with detailed information on approaches and practical steps to reforms can be found at www.wbginvestmentclimate.org/health. In conjunction with the other available resources and with the expertise at the country level, this Report should be used as an advocacy tool in the reform process. The framework developed here and used to assess engagement across Sub-Saharan Africa provides a starting point for developing a country-speci c reform agenda, and better engage- ment can lead to reforms in the health sector more broadly. Even though the challenges are enormous and improvements in African health systems are urgent, the willingness\u2014and even demand\u2014to look at health systems in a new way is reason to hope. When public and private sectors work in partnership, improved access to affordable, high-quality care is achievable in Africa. xx | Healthy Partnerships Healthy Partnerships | 1 Introduction Africa's health systems are in crisis. Sub- Saharan Africa accounts for 12 percent of the world's population yet bears 26 percent of the global disease burden. 9 Health outcomes in the region are poor and signi cantly worse than elsewhere. Patients too often are denied access to high-quality goods and services, and achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4, 5, and 6, which are related to health, is unlikely. Most of the region lacks the infrastructure and facilities necessary to provide adequate levels of health services and products. It also faces a severe shortage of trained medical personnel; just 3 per-cent of the world's health workers are deployed in Sub-Saharan Africa. Asking governments alone to provide more and better services is not enough. Since the pri-vate sector is large, improving services only through improvements of public sector services will be\u2014at best\u2014only partially successful. Although the size of the private sector varies by country, it is surprisingly large and constitutes an important, diverse component of the region's health care sys-tems. Roughly half of all spending across the region is captured by private providers. 10 Helping private providers offer a wider range of quality services is imperative. Part of the solution lies in better collaboration between the public and pri-vate health sectors. The objective of this Report is to suggest poli- cies and practices that improve engagement between the public and private health sectors, based on the needs and priorities of each country. For the purposes of this Report, engagement means the deliberate, systematic collaboration of the government and the private health sector according to national health priorities, beyond individual inter-ventions and programs.A set of measures to assess and compare engage- ment is presented in Section 2. The emphasis is on a basic level of engagement\u2014whether private health provision is included in the government's policies, planning, and implementation. Especially in countries where the private health sector is large, engaging the private health sector along the basic domains that we have de ned is essential for the proper functioning of the health care system. Such engagement should be undertaken strategi-cally rather than piecemeal, and within the context of the country's priorities and political decisions. In this Report, the term public-private partner- ship (PPP) is used only as a reference to particular transactions. A public-private joint venture for an individual hospital, for example, would be called a PPP. The other use of the term PPP, to denote ongoing public-private cooperation more generally, is not applied here. PPPs are discussed as one par-ticular form of engagement on individual projects. De nition of the private sector The private health sector is de ned here to include all nonstate providers. This includes pharmacies, hospitals, retailers, and doctors who operate on both a for-pro t and a nonpro t basis. Many coun- tries also rely heavily on traditional healers. There are several organizational forms: \u0081 For-pro t operators typically pay market rates to obtain nancing and charge a market rate for their products and services. The \"for-pro t\" label can be misleading, however, because many do not make an of cially declared pro t and some incur signi cant losses. To account for this, we use the term \"self- nancing\" inter- changeably or in conjunction with \"for pro t.\"2 | Healthy Partnerships\u0081 Nonpro ts are typically associated with a broader nongovernmental organization, whether domestic or international, from which they sometimes receive nancial or managerial sup- port. Some of the declared nonpro ts are actu- ally quite pro table, charging market rates for all of their services. Faith-based organizations are the dominant nonpro t health providers in many African countries, and are sometimes so intertwined with the public health sector that they are indistinguishable. 11 As Section 1 explains, however, faith-based organizations\u2014though they are the most important nonpro- ts\u2014are not as prevalent in the health care system overall as is commonly thought. The self- nancing or for-pro t facilities collectively provide a far larger share of health care services in most countries. \u0081 Traditional practitioners and informal provid- ers constitute a large group in many countries. Bringing them under the direct infl uence of policies and engaging with them at the systems level is a major challenge. Their role within the health system must be well understood if health interventions are to be successful. These different entities that constitute the private health sector, and their engagement with the gov-ernment, are further discussed in the following sections. Two additional groups of actors are worth mentioning, though they are not considered a part of the private health sector: (a) intermediaries or third-party organizations, such as insurance authorities, nonhealth private sector organizations, or civil society organizations (such as consumer advocacy groups); and (b) donors, who have an important role in nancing health programs and shaping health policy indirectly at a national level. The role of the private sector in delivering and nancing health care services The role of the private health sector is not just a critical issue, but a contentious one as well. This Report does not recommend an appropriate size for the private sector, particularly in terms of health care service delivery. For the public and private health sectors, the quality of provided care and the ability to deliver care in underserved areas is highly variable. iii The growth of the pri- vate health sector for its own sake is not the goal of this Report. National governments should, however, make best use of available resources to address the tremendous health care challenges. The insistence that privately provided care should be replaced at any cost by publicly pro-vided care does not provide a practical way for-ward for African health systems. With regard to nancing of health care ser- vices, we refer to the conclusions of the \"World Health Report 2010,\" which calls attention to the high proportion of out-of-pocket payments for health systems in poor countries, particularly in Africa. 12 The report strongly advocates reduc- ing the share of out-of-pocket payments while increasing the reach of risk-pooling mechanisms, whether public or private. The same conclusion was reached in the International Finance Corpo-ration 2008 report, \"The Business of Health in Africa,\" which focused on the private health sec-tor in Africa. 13 Reducing out-of-pocket pay- ments is likely to be achieved at least partly by increased public nancing and by a lower overall private sector share in health nancing. Appen- dix 5 offers projections for how health nancing and the public-private mix in health nancing may develop in the coming years. The focus of this Report is primarily on nal service delivery and the facilities that provide such services (hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and, to a limited extent, diagnostic laboratories). Less focus is placed on the private sector's role in input markets, such as for drugs and equipment, educa-tion of medical professionals, and so forth. This prioritization does not imply that the private sec-tor does not matter for input markets, but is sim-ply based on the need to focus the analysis. Engaging the private sector outside of service iii. The private health sector is said to be better at providing curative care than preventive care, even when preventive care might be more cost-effective. This observed tendency, however, has much to do with the way care is nanced (that is, largely out-of-pocket payments paid by individuals only when they get sick) and less with what types of services the private health sector can provide effectively. Healthy Partnerships | 3 delivery (such as support services like nonmedical services for public hospitals) is discussed in Sec-tion 3 as an example of how to start with small reforms. The critical role of the private health sec-tor in input markets and potential indicators of public-private engagement in input markets can be addressed in future research. Type of providers we focus on This Report focuses on government engagement with the full range of actors within the private health care system, especially smaller providers of private health services, because they comprise the most numerous and most accessible source of care to many people. The sophisticated and highly spe-cialized institutions, such as private tertiary hospi-tals for the urban affl uent, are also an important part of the landscape. We are a bit less interested in these institutions, however, even though they are of interest to investors. These institutions do not really have a problem with engagement because they are big and prominent; they deal directly with the government and often do so fairly well. Partnerships with these institutions are discussed separately below. At the other end of the spectrum, health ser- vices are often offered by small formal and infor-mal providers, including friends and family. While a part of this informal provision of care will remain outside the reach of policies and reg-ulations, informal providers who are not regis-tered but who offer services in a commercial fashion are important players in many African health care systems. The quality of care among this group of providers ranges widely. Creating ef cient platforms for their formalization and including more of these informal providers in the organization and planning of the overall health sector should be a priority. The best strat-egies for engaging these groups will vary from country to country, but the potential bene ts of forging closer links are large. Geographic scope of analysis The Report focuses on 45 Sub-Saharan African countries, excluding Djibouti, Eritrea, and Soma-lia. iv Page 4 contains a complete list and map ( g- ure 01) of the countries. It should be noted that the framework for analysis and reform of engagement introduced in this Report may be relevant for developing coun-tries outside of Africa, as well. iv.

Where it is useful to be more speci c, however, maternal and child health (MCH) is used as a proxy. This is appropriate, because MCH is included in two of the three health MDGs and will therefore rightly capture the attention of pol-icy makers and other stakeholders. On a more technical level, MCH measures are good proxies for the performance of the overall health system, especially in Africa. Indeed, the best current data source for health-related information is the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), which has good coverage of MCH issues. Assessing engagement across the region As mentioned, the objective of this Report is to improve engagement between the public and pri-vate health sectors. We identi ed ve \"domains\" that comprise engagement. They are as follows: \u0081 Policy and dialogue: This encompasses the underlying policy framework related to the pri-vate health sector and the degree to which the private health sector is included in discussions regarding policy and practices. \u0081 Information exchange: This is the fl ow of opera- tional information between the private health sector and the Ministry of Health. \u0081 Regulation: This comprises the rules that gov- ern the private health sector, including the registration of health providers and quality control. \u0081 Financing: This comprises the sources of funding and purchasing arrangements to pay for goods and services delivered by private providers. \u0081 Public provision of services: This includes the goods and services directly produced by the public sector that impact the operating envi-ronment of the private health sector. The process used to collect data for this Report was as follows.Between February and July 2010, a team of six consultants conducted more than 750 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders during on-site visits to the 45 countries mentioned above. Data were collected and coded for each of the ve domains from each of the 45 countries. This included written (de jure) information and empir-ical information\u2014that is, what was happening in practice (de facto), as we describe in Section 2. Standardized guidelines were used to collect the data, and a key-respondent list was developed to ensure that approximately the same number and type of respondents were interviewed in each country. Interviewees included government of - cials, policy makers, regulators, private providers, development organizations, and independent experts. The data collected during the interviews were combined, as appropriate, with data from desk research. The team coded the interview data to allow comparison across countries. The results were then validated by two in-country experts to ensure accuracy. Why measure at all Introducing new comparative measures in the health sector is especially challenging, because the standard for demonstrating impact is high. For individual interventions or programs, scienti cally rigorous impact evaluations are necessary to dem-onstrate impact. At the systems level, such tools cannot be employed easily, especially with poli-cies or practices pertaining to the private health sector. Most of the effects one might hope to attri-bute directly to changes in policy will be over-whelmed by other variables, including changes in nonhealth policies, the economy (for example, the recent global recession), weather, agricultural out-put, and nutrition. This should not be a reason to ignore the rela- tionship between the private and public health care sectors. The policies and practices of public-private engagement can and ought to be studied. 14 As Section 2 will show, engagement matters in countless cases across the region; successes have been documented where engagement works well, and inef ciencies linger where it does not. We have also explored the more tenuous link between 6 | Healthy Partnershipsengagement and health outcomes, but these results are not presented here due to their tenta-tive and somewhat experimental nature. See box 01 for a discussion of how standard- ized policy measures can be effective in spurring reform, even as the health care sector differs from the business sector in terms of goods and services provided in a market environment.International and regional agreement on the issue\u2014demand for this work This Report is not unique in arguing for increased attention to engagement. Internationally, a con-sensus is emerging that the private sector's role in delivering health care should be understood and better leveraged. Even among critics, the importance of proper engagement is increasingly acknowledged, and prominent international organizations increasingly are endorsing this view. The World Health Organization in 2010 emphasized the importance of \"strengthening The Role of Business Environment Measures in Reform BOX 01 International organizations that need to assess and com- pare the operating environment for private business across countries use such sources as the World Bank's Doing Business rankings, the World Economic Forum's Global Competive-ness Index, and the Economist Intelligence Unit's country-risk pro les. These business environment snapshots, while imperfect, are a useful guide to the political, economic, legal, and regulatory challenges rms face when operating locally. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where the private health sec-tor is large and diverse, the quality of the business environ-ment is particularly important, and is likely to be a critical factor in the provision of private health services. Most Sub-Saharan African countries rank poorly in the global business environment indexes. In the 2011 Doing Business indicators, the 46 Sub-Saharan Africa countries had an average rank of 137 out of 183 countries, the worst in the world. The relative standing for most African countries is similar in other indexes, as well. Although the rankings do not measure conditions for health providers\u2014such as the number of procedures required to open a clinic or a pharmacy\u2014the focus on small, locally owned and operated rms is relevant, because most private health providers are in this category. Some of the measures have been quite successful in motivating policy reform. For example, Rwanda has steadily reformed its commercial laws and institutions and was the leading reformer in the Doing Business 2010 report, moving from 143rd to 67th place in the ranking. Overall, Rwanda introduced reforms in 7 of the 10 catego- ries, including reducing the time to start a business to three days (involving just two procedures), better than most developed countries. It also cut the time required to register property by 255 days, eased access to credit by allowing a wider range of assets to be used as collateral, and removed bottlenecks at the revenue authority. Rwanda also maintained its place among the top-10 reformers in the 2011 Doing Business report, coming in second of the top-10 reformers and improving its overall rank on the ease of doing business scale to 58th of the 183 economies ranked. However, health care is not like most other industries, so most business environment measures are insuf cient. All global business environment guides assume companies are providing goods and services in a market environment in which the private sector is dominant, the normal forces of supply and demand are paramount, and a lighter regu-latory touch is preferred. These assumptions are not always true in health care. Medical care is widely regarded as a human right, not a discretionary service. As such, govern-ments will inevitably play an oversight role, setting national policies and goals and then, ideally, integrating the private sector into a wider plan. The partly public nature of health care usually leads governments to take on the responsibil-ity of ensuring access to and quality of the system, con-cerns that are typically the responsibility of private rms in nonhealth businesses.

Healthy Partnerships | 7 the capacity of governments to constructively engage the private sector in providing essential health-care services.\" 15 More important, it is African policy makers and health sector practitioners who are increas-ingly aware that improved engagement is needed. Policy makers are recognizing the need to employ the resources that are available in their countries and to work with the choices that consumers make, such as when they choose private over public providers. Indeed, we have found strong support for our work among policy makers and private sector representatives, and among inde-pendent experts in each country. There is almost universal consensus about the overall approach: the private sector, including the for-pro t sector, should be better included in the national health system and can make a greater contribution to it than is currently the case. Roadmap of the Report Section 1 explains the focus on engagement and why this is an opportune time to offer a frame-work for analysis and reform. Section 2 presents the results of our compara- tive analysis of engagement in 45 Sub-Saharan African countries. Using a public economics framework, we analyze engagement using the ve domains described earlier. Positive and negative case studies illustrate the challenges and potential for reform. Section 3 discusses next steps, both in terms of future research and needed reforms. An action plan is presented for each of the relevant stake-holders: governments, the private sector, donors, and third-party organizations. Topics that should guide future policy discussions are introduced and briefl y discussed. Five appendixes present additional indicators for countries covered by this Report and details on the methodology used. Appendix 1 provides a snapshot of each of the 45 countries. Appendix 2 contains data tables with the full set of indicators that are used in the Report. Appendix 3 presents background on the concepts underlying the framework of engagement. Appendix 4 presents the methods used to obtain the engagement data. Appendix 5 offers projections for how health nancing and the public-private mix in health nancing may develop in the coming years. 8 | Healthy Partnerships Healthy Partnerships | 9 Section 1: What engagement is and why it matters Some of the solutions for improving the per- formance of health systems in Africa are not dif cult, as the stories of Yaaba and Efue show. From the perspective of both clinical prac-tice and health systems oversight, Yaaba's death was preventable. Had her obstructed labor been correctly identi ed by the midwife and the refer- ral to All Saints Hospital happened sooner, both she and her child would likely have been saved. Efue was more fortunate in choosing a provider who recognized the limits of her ability and referred Efue in time. While this relatively simple clinical solution can vastly improve health care for pregnant women in Africa, the continued operation of a provider like Sophie's Maternity Home puts expectant mothers with any kind of complication at risk. Had a regulatory board or a midwife's council exercised even the most basic oversight, Sophie's Maternity Home would have been forced to improve or close, and Yaaba and her child might have lived. The private health sector overall would have had the chance to con- tribute better service. Private providers have an important role to play across Africa. Much of the care provided by the private health sector is of high quality. Some is not. As stewards of their health systems, gov-ernments should be seeking ways to improve the contributions of the private sector across the region. Many are already doing so, but few details are known about the roles being per-formed, how they vary across the continent, and what works and what does not. 16 Even less is known about what kind of collaboration between the public and private sector best fur-thers the public interest in an African context. This Report seeks to ll that gap by presenting and discussing our results in a way that will con-tribute to the conversation, regionally and in individual countries. (See box 1.1 for a discus-sion of the broader \"Health in Africa\" context in which this Report was written.)In July 2010, 27-year-old Yaaba was admitted late at night to the All Saints Hospital in Western Africa, a private facility run by Dr. Kwabena. Referred from the nearby Sophie's Maternity Home, also a private institution, Yaaba reached the hospital already in shock. She had been in labor for 36 hours and had suffered a uterine rupture before her arrival at All Saints. While Dr. Kwabena performed emergency surgery, other medical staff began blood transfusions and fl uid replacement, but neither Yaaba's life nor that of her child could be saved. Her obstructed labor was not in itself a death sentence. Prompt identi cation of the problem and quick referral to the hospital would almost certainly have saved her life and her child's. To make matters worse, several other pregnant women had been referred from Sophie's Maternity Home too late to make a difference, ending in needless tragedy. Two weeks after Yaaba died at All Saints, 22-year-old Efue arrived at the same hospital. She, too, was in obstructed labor and had been suffering for 10 hours. Fortunately, the problem was identi ed relatively quickly and she was referred early enough to All Saints\u2014but from a different privately run maternity home. After Dr. Kwabena and two attending nurses performed a cesarean section, Efue delivered a baby girl who required only minor resuscitation. Efue and her daughter recovered quickly. After a week, Efue's stitches were removed and she and her daughter were discharged. v v. All names have been changed.10 | Healthy PartnershipsCollaboration between the private and public sector in health is nothing new in Africa. Indeed, the private sector as a provider of health care ser-vices predates political independence and the emergence of the public health sector in most countries. There are many good examples of public-private collaboration within health subsectors and disease programs. Partnerships on speci c proj- ects and in individual hospitals are not uncom-mon. We return to these below, because they constitute elements of what we understand to be engagement.In this Report, we focus primarily on the degree to which engagement with the private health sec-tor is comprehensive. Thus, in accordance with our de nition of engagement, we consider the most basic building blocks of engagement at the systems level: whether governments are taking the private health sector into account at a funda-mental level and therefore making the best possi-ble use of available resources in all the subsectors of their countries' health systems. The Context of the \"Healthy Partnerships\" Report BOX 1.1 This Report's focus on how governments and the pri- vate health sector are working together is being pre- sented in the context of the \"Health in Africa\" initiative, a joint project of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) (for more information, see www.wbginvestmentclimate.org/health ). Assessing and improving public-private engagement is, however, only one element in increasing the contributions of the private health sector in the region. Therefore, some context on the motivation for this Report is useful. In December 2007, with the assistance of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the IFC published \"The Busi-ness of Health in Africa: Partnering with the Private Sector to Improve People's Lives.\" The report concluded that: (a) Private providers already play a signi cant role in the health sector in Africa. A poor African woman today is as likely to take her sick child to a private hospital or clinic as to a public facility. (b) The private sector is sometimes the only option for health care in rural regions and poor urban slums. Pri-vate providers serve all income levels, have broad geo-graphic reach, and are expected to continue to play a key role in Sub-Saharan Africa's health systems. (c) The private and public sectors must work together to develop more viable, sustainable, and equitable health care systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. The private sector can help expand access to services for the poorest peo-ple and reduce the nancial burden on governments. \"The Business of Health in Africa\" identi ed a number of signi cant constraints to the further development of a sus- tainable and socially responsible private health sector that is integrated into the broader strategies developed by regional governments. These include limited access to capital, short-ages of skilled workers, a lack of risk-pooling mechanisms that can mobilize revenue for providers, and an inappropri-ate operating environment. To improve the operating envi-ronment, the report recommends (a) developing and enforcing quality standards through both government and self-regulation, (b) encouraging governments and donors to engage more closely with the private sector, and (c) modify-ing local policies and regulations to better support and mobilize the private sector. These ndings inform the \"Health in Africa\" initiative as it aims to increase access to health-related goods and services and improve well-being. Working directly with governments and the private health sectors in the region is a major part of this undertaking, as is the provision of nancing mechanisms for private health care providers. As an integral part of these ongoing efforts, the Healthy Partnerships Report reexamines some of the ndings of the \"Business of Health in Africa\" report and assesses the ways African governments are engaging with private providers. The detailed assessment and the recommendations of how partnerships can be improved are this Report's principal con-tributions. With better knowledge about engagement, one of the main constraints to better private sector contribu-tions can be addressed, which in turn will improve the per-formance of the health system overall. Healthy Partnerships | 11 Three observations provide the starting point for this Report: \u0081 Health systems in Africa are in urgent need of improvement.17 \u0081 The private health sector is too large to be ignored, though it is only partly and often poorly integrated into the health system. 18 \u0081 Even a minimum level of public-private engage- ment can improve the use of existing resources and contribute to better-quality health care in Africa. 19 OBSERVATION 1 Health systems in Africa are in urgent need of improvement Africa's policy makers face enormous challenges. Even in areas where the solutions are well known, such as improving maternal health, many health systems are not performing well. 20 The story of Yaaba is all too common. In too many countries, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are not being achieved and some trends are going in the wrong direction. 21 At the same time, out-of- pocket spending for health services is high, and the burden of these direct payments, especially on the poor, is potentially devastating ( gure 1.1). 22 An African woman has a 1 in 16 chance of dying in pregnancy or childbirth over the course of her life; in developed countries, the ratio is 1 in 4,000. 23 Although progress has been made on some fronts, health outcomes throughout much of the continent are dismal and hardly improving. Life expectancy at birth was just 53 years in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1990. By 2008, it had increased to only 54 years, a legacy of the acquired immune de ciency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. 24 In some cases, Africa is backsliding: the number of new tuberculosis cases (TB) in the region each year has more than doubled in the last two decades ( gure 1.2). 25 Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for almost 43 percent of all deaths globally in 2004 from communicable diseases, maternal ailments, and poor nutrition, even though it represents only 12 percent of the global population. 26 Even where progress has been made, it has been tful. Deaths of children under 5 years of age in Sub-Saharan Africa have declined by 28 percent since 1990, but every other region has improved even more, and the death rate is nearly twice as high as any place else ( gure 1.3). 27 Health systems across the region are not per- forming nearly well enough to adequately address the dismal state of health outcomes. Across the region, health systems lag far behind in measures of access and quality, and it is the poor who suffer most from this lack of performance. On average in a given country, only about half of all births take place in a health facility, and less than half of all children with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) are taken to a health care facility 28 (see gure 1.4). While only 15 percent of women of reproduc-tive age say they use modern family planning methods, a quarter of all women report an unmet need for contraception. 29 Almost one-quarter of children aged 12-23 months have not been vac-cinated against measles; diptheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) 30 (see gure 1.4). These regional averages mask signi cant dispari- ties, both among and within countries. In Benin, most women deliver in a facility; in Ethiopia, the vast majority of births take place at home and only FIGURE 1.1 Breakdown of Total Health Expenditure by Source in Sub-Saharan Africa 0102030405060708090100 50.5 72.4 Private sector share49.5 27.6 Publicsector sharepercent Out-of-pocketexpenditureRisk-pooled and otherprivateexpenditure Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators, 2010.

In Uganda, 76 percent of sick children see a provider in a health facility compared with only 9 percent in Chad. 32 In Niger, 16 percent of women of repro- ductive age report an unmet need for contracep-tion; in Rwanda, the gure is more than twice as large (37 percent). 33 In countries as diverse as Cape Verde, Eritrea, Mauritius, Rwanda, and the Sey-chelles, reported DPT immunization is almost uni-versal (97 to 99 percent), while in Chad, 80 percent of children have not been immunized. 34 Even where services are available and used, the quality is far from guaranteed. Across countries, almost 80 percent of women reported receiving some form of prenatal care from a professional health services provider. 35 In Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, 94 percent of expectant mothers said they received such prenatal care. 36 However, when asked whether they received all ve of the basic prenatal services at some point during their pregnancy (blood pressure checks, blood tests, urine tests, weight check, and discus-sion of complications), the picture is much bleaker. In Namibia, only 53 percent reported Healthy Partnerships | 13 receiving all ve services; in Tanzania, only 20 per- cent did; and in Rwanda and Uganda, less than 5 percent did ( gure 1.5). 37 Worse, large gaps persist among socioeconomic groups in almost all countries. While the quality of prenatal care is fairly constant for women in Namibia, Tanzanian women are four times more likely to receive all ve services if they are in the top wealth quintile compared to the women in the lowest quintile. 38 The disparities in quality of care are even bleaker for women in Rwanda and Uganda, as gure 1.5 shows. Similarly large gaps exist in terms of access to care. Women in the top wealth quintile across the region are nearly six times more likely to deliver in a facility than women in the lowest quintile, while women in urban areas are three times more likely to do so than women in rural areas. 39 The lack of over- all access exacerbates disparities, as we saw in our earlier examples. In Ethiopia, inequality in access to facilities is stark: the richest women are 35 times more likely to deliver in a facility than the poorest women, and mothers in urban areas are 18 times more likely to do so than those in rural areas. 40 Even at the lower end of the inequal- ity spectrum, Benin, differences persist: the rich-Children under 3 with ARI symptoms receiving care in medical facility (%) Expectant mothers receiving prenatal care from a skilled medical professional (%) Deliveries with skilled medical professional (%) 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0Children receiving measles immunization (%) Children receiving DPT immunization (%) FIGURE 1.4 Health Services Access De cit in Sub-Saharan Africa Women getting all 5 PNC services (%): Total population Women getting all 5 PNC services (%): quintile Richest quintile 1.43.013.250.8 48.0 Uganda Tanzania Namibia FIGURE 1.5 Within-Country Disparities in Quality of Care Source: RAND analysis of Demographic and Health Survey data, latest survey year included.

The pri-vate sector\u2014whether funding health care or delivering it\u2014is a large and important part of the landscape in Africa. Of the roughly US$55 billion spent on health care in Africa in 2007, 55 percent came from private parties, and most of that was paid by individuals out-of-pocket. 42 About half of that expenditure was captured by private provid-ers. 43 Many of the transactions between patients and providers are happening regardless of government policy. Despite the availability of \"free\" essential services at public health centers in some coun-tries, private facilities still provide a sig-ni cant portion of the services. In Uganda, for example, more than 60 per-cent of children with symptoms of ARI taken to a facility are treated by the pri-vate health sector. 44 The private sector serves the poor Private care is not just the province of the rich, who are better able to afford it. While in some countries, such as Namibia and South Africa, the private health sector indeed caters primarily to the wealthy who have private health insurance, this situation does not hold regionally. Studies consistently show that the private sector cares for people from a wide range of incomes, including poor and rural populations. 45 In Chad, Niger, and Uganda, more than 40 per-cent of people in the lowest economic quintile who seek health care for chil-dren with symptoms of ARI do so from private, self- nancing providers. 46 Across Africa, 52 per- cent of those in the bottom income quintile received their care from private providers, equal to the proportion of Africans in the top quintile, as shown in gure 1.6. The gure shows that the private sector's share in delivering services is fairly constant across the income quintiles, viewed regionally. Consumer choice matters Many patients have options when they need health services and make thoughtful decisions about where to access care. This is often a separate concern from how far they have to travel or how much they need to pay. 47 Research has shown that consumers choose their health-care providers based at least in part on perceived levels of qual-ity. 48 Studies conducted in rural northern Tanza- nia found that people will skip providers closer to 0102030405060708090100 Poorest Public sectorpercent Poorer Middle Richer Richest5248 49 51 51 48 5149 4952 Private sector Source: Analysis of DHS surveys; latest survey year available included; Montagu 2010.

Patients often choose private providers over public facilities because they prefer the type and quality of care being offered by private providers. It is important for governments to acknowledge and, where possible, take advantage of, such health-seeking behavior rather than ignore it. 50 The private health sector, even on a single street, makes up a rich and diverse marketplace of ser-vices that, on balance, contribute positively to the health landscape. Taiwo Road example A drive along Taiwo Road in Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, paints a picture of the typical cosmo-politan African town. Buildings of every size, shape, and condition are arrayed in a jumble along the road; dingy and deluxe residential apartments exist side by side with banks, appli-ance shops, and of ces. Tucked between these stores and shops are clinics, pharmacies, and, at the upper end of the road, the federally funded University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital. People come to this almost three-mile-long strip to buy practically everything\u2014from clothes to electron-ics, groceries to medications. They also come to visit the bank, get a haircut or a manicure, and see a doctor. The teaching hospital does not charge for consultations, but all surgeries are billed accord-ing to a standard price list for the procedure. Medications and medical supplies can also be purchased from the pharmacy department at set fees. Hassanat Memorial Hospital, also on Taiwo Road, is a private establishment where many low-income mothers receive general medical care for their sick children. Use of generic medi-cations keeps prices low, and the average patient pays about 1,000 naira (about US$7) for malaria treatment, the most common malady the hospi-tal sees. Further along Taiwo Road is Joe-Steve Private Hospital, which is well known for elec-tive surgical services, especially for those who would rather not linger on the teaching hospi- tal's long and erratic waiting lists. The price dif-ferential between the private facility and the government hospital is not large for surgeries, and the level of expertise of the surgeons is the same, although the teaching hospital is better equipped. Those who need antibiotics, hospital consum- ables, and other medications not available in the teaching hospital's pharmacy know to visit the private Momrota Pharmacy, which is conve-niently located next to the hospital. Ekundayo Pharmacy, another private provider about 300 meters south of Momrota, also stocks everything from over-the-counter medicines to intravenous fl uids. Other drug sellers and patent medicine vendors can be found within walking distance on this busy street. A typical consumer walks in with a \"prescription,\" which could have been written by a friend, colleague, or health worker. While some ask the pharmacists and drug sellers to recommend the best drug treatment plan to treat their illness, a nal decision may be based on ability to pay. Ilorin is also home to traditional bone setters, who are well known for their expertise in \"cur-ing\" fractures of all kinds. But they have been known to refer patients with genuinely serious problems to orthopedic specialists at the teach-ing hospital. Some of these traditional practition-ers charge more than the teaching hospital for fracture management, but some consumers pre-fer them anyway. Baptist Hospital, a faith-based facility, is located in nearby Ogbomoso. It was established as Baptist Medical Center in 1917, but has since grown to be a critical care institution with the rank of a teaching hospital. People have been coming from neighboring villages and even states to be treated at Ogbomoso because, like many faith-based facilities in Nigeria, it is considered to be more accessible and affordable than other hospitals. The private health sector in many African countries is similarly vibrant, demonstrating much of the diversity on display in Ilorin, Nigeria.16 | Healthy PartnershipsWide range of providers\u2014 different needs and opportunities As the Taiwo Road example shows, health services in Africa are delivered by a wide variety of private providers. They range from formally trained spe-cialists in clinical care to roadside vendors hawk-ing dubious medications to traditional healers in corner shops. As discussed above, the private sector share of health care provision across income quintiles is very stable. However, the share shifts toward more formal and higher-quality providers in the higher-income population. Figure 1.7 shows the sources of private health care by income. The formal pro-viders are labeled in blue and the informal provid-ers in red. In some countries, drug sellers are recognized as formal providers and are permitted to sell a limited range of medicines; in other countries, they cannot operate without a supervising phar-macist. Informal and traditional practitioners most often work in rural areas, almost always without government oversight. Of cial policies and practices impact different providers in unique ways. The degree to which they are affected by, or are in need of, government intervention differs widely. A critical element of good engagement is the government's understand-ing of the composition and capacity of the private sector. This includes knowing the approximate range and relative importance of provider types in each country. Some policies are based on an incomplete or inaccurate picture of the actors in the health system. This makes it essential to collect basic information on private- and public-sector activities in a systematic, consistent manner. As the Introduction indicated, this Report focuses on the full range of the private health sec-tor, including the numerous small, private provid-ers. These are doctors, nurses, and midwives with modest clinics, and lower-level health workers who make primary care more readily available to underserved populations in many countries. These workers go by different names in different coun-tries and include clinical of cers, assistant medical of cers, medical assistants, physician assistants, and health of cers. Many of these providers also work in the public system or supplement the ser-vices offered by doctors in public facilities. They can triage patients and successfully treat most common ailments, but they face a number of con-straints when they practice privately. One common complaint among lower-level health workers is the unequal opportunity to practice. They may be allowed to run public facil-ities on their own, but must nd a supervising doctor when they aspire to operate privately. Some of the constraints are imposed for safety reasons\u2014a few providers are overzealous and are tempted to stray beyond their capabilities and training. But other constraints are simply due to poor planning and untargeted policies. Regulators appear overwhelmed by the diversity of actors, levels of training, and the dif culty in nding effective, standardized guides for their practice. Traditional medical practitioners (TMPs) are a case in point. Policy makers (and international organizations working in health) have found it dif cult to integrate them fully into the health systems. However, in some African countries, TMPs far outnumber orthodox practitioners; Swaziland is home to about 11,000 TMPs but only 200 physicians for a population of about 1.2 million. 51 In other countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports similarly glaring contrasts in availability of health service providers. WHO cites studies done in Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia that reveal TMP-to-popula-tion ratios of 1:200 to 1:400; allopathic practitio-ner ratios were typically 1:20,000 or less. 52 Traditional medical practice is a highly lucrative business in some countries, and consumers can sometimes pay more than they would for allo-pathic clinical care. Zambia, for instance, has an estimated 40,000 healers who garner about 60 percent of total household health spending. 53 From these numbers, it is evident that traditional medicine is consistently popular among patients even though it comes with many challenges. Peo-ple have been known to suffer complications because of time lost trying traditional cures, and some herbal medicines are ingested in borderline toxic proportions for long periods, leading to kid-ney disease. 54 Pregnant women have developed vesico-vaginal stulas at the hands of overzeal- ous traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who do Healthy Partnerships | 17 not know the limits of their practice.55 Some unscrupulous TMPs mix up pharmaceutical products into so-called \"herbal medicines\" with-out regard for dosage, side effects, drug interac-tions, or toxicity. The highly informal care that some providers offer to friends and family will likely remain beyond the reach of regulation. This is true not just in Africa. But the relative size of the informal sector can be infl uenced by registration policies and practices. At the other end of the spectrum are large private hospitals that are often in a posi-tion to collaborate directly with the Ministry of Health. They are often subject to very speci c rules and therefore are also outside the normal regulatory framework. The very scale of the collab-oration for these large institutions may necessitate such special treatment. The new Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Maseru, Lesotho, is such an example. The collaboration between the government and a consortium led by Netcare, a leading private health care provider in South Africa that manages the hospital, has received much attention and been seen as a model. Since the hospital is the big-gest in Lesotho and received around US$100 mil- lion in investment, it is governed by different rules than most other health care providers. This col-laboration, and similar, speci c partnerships, pro- vides an opportunity for improved engagement with the private health sector. Different rules also apply to the nonpro t sec- tor, especially faith-based organizations (FBOs). These differences tend to persist even as the lines of separation between the subsectors fade or dis-appear. Here, too, the structure and history in each country matters. Nongovernmental organi-zations (NGOs) are nonpro t organizations, although many are quite lucrative. Faith-based providers, in particular, are often assumed to dom-inate the private health sector, but in-depth assess-ments in several countries show FBOs constitute a smaller proportion than is generally assumed. In Kenya, for instance, 43 percent of the facil- ities in the Ministry of Health database in 2006 were privately owned, 41 percent were publicly controlled, and just 16 percent were nonpro ts, which includes faith-based facilities.

These gures are consistent with the fact that there are 1,400 more (280 percent more) private commercial facilities than FBO facilities in Kenya. 56 The private health sector assessment in Ghana found that private providers (both self- nanced and faith-based) produce 56 percent of all ser-vices used by Ghanaian consumers, as measured by the respective shares of self-reported utiliza-tion. Only 7 percent of the total comes from the faith-based sector. 57 Though the relative share of private self- nanc- ing, private nonpro t, and public providers differs considerably between countries, the results shown in gure 1.8 for Ghana and Kenya are indicative of the regional averages. An earlier study on the regionwide share of health spending captured by for-pro t or self- nancing providers compared to nonpro t providers came to a similar conclusion. 58 The private health sector offers the full spectrum of quality of care The care provided by the private sector is not always as good as it should be. In countries where the private health sector is large and diverse, examples of unethical business practices are all too common. The opportunities to engage in over- and underservicing, false billing, and price goug-ing are especially damaging when many of the patients are poor, badly informed, or illiterate. Cases of self-referral, in which patients are directed to other services in which the provider has a nancial interest, are frequent. 59 And, just like their public sector counterparts, even respon-sible private health care providers sometimes fail to deliver an appropriate level of care. 60 The overall impact of private-sector providers on health systems and on equity is itself a much-debated issue. Several studies have shown that the quality of care provided by the private health sector in underregulated developing countries can be poor. This can adversely affect health out-comes, including disease control and drug resis-tance. 61 But poor quality is also a challenge for public providers, and consumers often prefer the private sector due to perceived better quality, easier access, and greater responsiveness. Evi-dence from recent multicountry studies suggests that quality of care and provider competence are roughly equivalent in the public and private health sectors ( gure 1.9). 62 A recent cross-country analysis of Sub-Saharan Africa found that private sector participation is positively and signi cantly associated with better health system performance, improving access, and reducing disparities between rich and poor and FIGURE 1.8 Distribution of Facility Ownership Public Kenya, 2006 Ghana, 2005-06Private self-financed Private nonprofit41%44% 49%7% 16% 43% Source: 2010; Results for Development Institute, forthcoming.

Healthy Partnerships | 19 Making best use of available resources This Report does not to argue for a greater share of privately provided care, but for acknowledging the private sector as an important component in the provision of health care to all. While public spend-ing on health care is sometimes believed to mostly bene t the poor, the opposite is true. It is frequently the wealthy, not the poor, who disproportionately bene t from public spending, and not just in Africa. A 2010 study found that 17 percent of the bene ts from public health spending globally accrue to the poorest quintile compared with 23 percent to the richest quintile (see gure 1.10). In Sub-Saharan Africa, the disparity is even more pronounced: the poorest quintile bene ts from only 13 percent of public money for health care compared to almost 29 percent bene ting the richest quintile. 70 Another study recorded a similar bene t distribu- tion in Ghana: one-third of public health spending bene ts the richest quintile, while just 12 percent of public health spending bene ts the poorest quintile. The numbers are similar for Tanzania. 71 urban and rural populations. The results are robust to controlling for per capita gross domestic prod-uct and maternal education, two important confounding factors that are correlated with both increased private sector participation and improved health care access ( gure 1.9). 63 A large private sector share may raise concerns about user fees thought to be associated primar-ily with the provision of private health services. User fees suggest that increasing the role of the private sector will limit the use of health care among the poorest, who cannot afford to pay, consequently reducing access and equity. 64 Evi- dence suggests, however, that these concerns are not limited to the private health sector. Indeed, across the region, a considerable amount of \"pri-vate business\" takes place in supposedly free pub-lic health care facilities. Visits to public clinics or dispensaries across the region usually require the patient to part with some amount of money for the doctor or health care provider. 65 In some set- tings, this is a normal practice that is condoned (though not openly sanctioned) by the Ministry of Health to retain poorly paid public sector health workers. In other countries, such \"under-the-table\" payments in state-owned facilities are frowned upon or even criminalized. Overall, there is no systematic evidence on whether user fees in the public sector are even lower than in the private sector. 66 For example, patient exit sur- veys conducted as part of a 2009 study in Ghana found that the amount of out-of-pocket pay-ments patients pay is similar in public and private facilities ( gure 1.9). 67 The best approach to improving access to care is to build on the resources of a private health sec-tor that is already responsible for a large part of the current levels of access, especially in light of the resource constraints of existing health sys-tems. 68 Beyond nancial resources, the private health sector can bring innovation, competition, responsiveness to patients, and management capacity into the system. A range of interventions designed to improve use and equity through engagement of self- nanced providers has been shown to be successful ( gure 1.9). 69 FIGURE 1.9 Contributions of the Private Health Sector Source: Das, Hammer, and Leonard 2008; Yoong et al. 2010; Results for Development Institute, forthcoming; Patouillard, Goodman, and Hanson 2007.COMPLEMENTARY Services provided by private and public health sectors complement each other; they are overall equivalent in terms of \u2014 Quality of delivered care \u2014 Out-of-pocket payments required to receive care At the systems level, higher private sector participation in Sub-Saharan African countries is not associated with reduced access or higher disparities in access. SPECIFIC & ADDITIONAL Private health sector also offers unique contributions to the health system, namely (i) technology and innovation; (ii) needed nancial capital; (iii) competition, which can raise overall system performance; (iv) management skills; and (v) fl exibility to adapt to dif cult and often fast-changing circumstances. Plus, there are examples of engagement (e.g. for speci c interventions) which have achieved tangible results quickly. They are discussed below in Observation 3.20 | Healthy PartnershipsThe evidence cited here suggests that the pri- vate health sector has a positive contribution to make to meet the formidable challenges that Afri-can health systems are facing, even as concerns with private delivery remain. Appropriate collabo-ration and partnerships within the health system are needed to leverage the contributions effectively. Despite the private sector's large role, much of what it does is not aligned with national health priorities. In Kenya, for example, a frequently voiced frustration from all parties is that hospital bed occupancy rates differ dramatically between public and private facilities: while several private hospitals in Kenya have empty beds, public hospi-tals are overcrowded. 72 In some instances, these overcrowded public hospitals are adjacent to underused private hospitals. Elsewhere, the dif- ferential bed occupancy rates may be reversed, but the main point holds: in an environment in which overall resources are scarce, inef ciencies are especially costly, pointing to the need for bet-ter coordination. The question we seek to address is how the pri- vate health sector's contributions to the public interest can be improved. Replacing privately pro-vided services with publicly provided care\u2014which, it is often argued, should be less expensive, easier to access, and of better quality\u2014is impracti-cal where an entirely different medical infrastruc-ture has been evolving for more than half a century. Privately provided care should be a wel-come addition to government programs. OBSERVATION 3 A minimum level of engagement is an important part of the solution Governments are responsible for improving national health systems, a duty that is enshrined in the constitutions of most countries. But the lack of public resources, and the size of the private health sector in Africa, suggests that governments cannot ful ll this responsibility unless they prac- tice some minimal level of engagement. Indeed, basic elements of engagement are the most impor-tant\u2014making the private health sector a fully rec-ognized partner in policy setting, planning, and implementation. Section 2 offers evidence from our assessments across the region of whether and how govern-ments are currently engaging with the private health sector in each country. Consistent qualita-tive evidence illustrates the mostly positive effects of engagement. Similarly, the data show how a lack of engagement will hamper the effectiveness of public health interventions. The government's role in shaping the operating environment Engagement is not the only factor that shapes the environment within which the private health sec-tor operates. Just as important are the characteris-tics of the overall health system, and general government policies toward the private sector and the health sector. To present a more complete pic-ture, measures of engagement are compared with other aspects of the broader business operating environment. The country snapshots in Appendix 1 illustrate a selection of these measures for each country individually. One of the government's principal roles is to create a business environment conducive to invest-ment and growth and to create a \"level playing eld\" for all private rms. This overall business environment will also impact private providers in the health sector.

Healthy Partnerships | 21 ful lling this role? The World Bank's Doing Busi- ness indicators provide measures of the business environment for the private sector overall, as dis-cussed in box 01 in the Introduction. The regional Doing Business averages show that Africa lags behind in these measures and in its overall operat-ing environment. Figure 1.11 shows selected proxy measures for the Africa region compared to other regions and to countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The average among SSA countries for number of days it typically takes to enforce a contract is similar to the averages in other regions. In terms of paying taxes and starting up a business, however, the measures are signi - cantly worse for Africa. Only in Latin America and the Caribbean does it take longer to pay taxes or start a business. When it comes to the cost of start-ing a business relative to income, Africans have to pay the most by far.In Section 2, where the operating environment for private health providers is examined in more detail, we see that important differences emerge between the private health sector and the non-health private sectors. Infrastructure and the availability of essential services like water and electricity matter for any enterprise, including health providers. Whether such services are available, especially in rural areas, will signi cantly impact the cost of doing busi- ness. Given the distributed bene ts of providing these services, vi ensuring their availability is usu- ally a responsibility of the government. Access to clean water and provision of sanitation, as well as other inputs, are especially critical for private vi. That is, because many bene t from the services, any single person will not want to bear the costs of providing them. Therefore, a mechanism is needed through which many collectively can bear the cost, since many will reap the bene ts. In short, public nancing is needed.Time to enforce a contract (days) Time to start a business (days)Time to prepare and pay taxes (hours per year) Cost of business start up (% of income per capita)0 1,100 0 400 0 100 0 60SSA: OECDOECDLAC LAC LACLAC FIGURE 1.11 Comparison of Selected Business Environment Measures across Regions Source: World Bank, Doing Business 2011 .

Extending the provision of goods that are to be distributed to the private sector can improve the effectiveness of these public health interventions. Box 1.2 discusses this example from the perspective of private health providers. Impact on outcomes Evidence of the need for engagement at the sys-tems level is instructive, but understanding the impact on intermediate outcomes (access, equity) or even health outcomes (maternal mor-tality, under- ve mortality, life expectancy, and so forth) may be the ultimate test. Such esti-mates are part of the future research agenda. In the meantime, the evidence in the program eval-uation literature offers clues to the impact of including the private health sector in speci c interventions. Program evaluation evidence from maternal and child health literature An overarching theme of the maternal and child health (MCH) literature is that strategies must rst identify capacity to build on it. 73 There is growing evidence and an emerging consensus that these strategies must be targeted at the commu-nity level and executed by local stakeholders. This approach has accelerated improvements in out-comes across Sub-Saharan African countries. 74 Successful maternal health interventions using the private sector show how initiatives can be scaled up to achieve better health outcomes. The following three interventions have bene ted from extensive evidence and support in maternal health literature: \u0081 Family planning: Ample evidence demonstrates that family planning is key to improving MCH outcomes and that family planning ideally lends itself to scale-up through the private sec-tor. One-third of maternal deaths could be pre-ventable if all families had access to family planning technology. 75 For example, private sector distribution of condoms and oral contra-ceptives has been under way with good results in several countries for decades. Indeed, around 57 percent of the developing world's expendi-ture on family planning is made by consumers operators who want to provide uninterrupted care to patients. As proxy measures for the avail-ability of key services, we include the World Bank's World Development Indicators on water and improved sanitation. These are also featured in the country snapshots. As an additional proxy measure for supporting services by the govern-ment, we include the rate of female literacy. Mothers who can read are not only an important determinant of child health\u2014the education of women is an indirect way for the government to improve the welfare of children\u2014but is also a proxy for the degree to which the private health sector's patients are in a position to make more informed decisions. As gure 1.12 shows, the private sector in Africa cannot rely on much support in terms of the availability of essential services. The connec- tion between the engagement indicators and the other indicators of the operating environment is fur-ther elaborated on in Appendix 4. One relatively uncontroversial avenue for engaging the private sector is providing nancial or technical assistance for activities that have large public health bene ts.

In terms of quality, community workers, who include pharmacists, health workers, volunteers, and dispensers, have been shown to safely and effectively administer injectable contraceptives at the household level. 77 \u0081 Misoprostol home deliveries for prevention of postpartum hemorrhaging: The ef cacy of misoprostol in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhaging (PPH) has been established by the obstetrics research community for settings where oxytocin is not available. 78 Misoprostol is not intended to discourage a movement toward more facility deliveries, but it is a prac-tical, scalable, and relatively inexpensive intervention that can reduce severe, life-threatening PPH, and can buy a woman time to reach a facility. Extensive evidence sup-ports expanded efforts either through govern-ments or NGO partners to train TBAs and other community health workers to adminis-ter misoprostol to women in labor in the home. 79 Scale-up of these efforts requires the implementation of safeguards to ensure that misoprostol is not administered until the third Government Financial or Technical Support for Public Health Activities in the Private Health Sector BOX 1.2 We surveyed private clinics in Ghana and Kenya to assess whether they received any nancial or tech- nical assistance from the government for conducting activ-ities that had potential public bene ts, including childhood immunization programs, control of HIV/AIDS, and antima-laria or tuberculosis initiatives. Figure B1.2 shows that in both Ghana and Kenya, relatively few private clinics report receiving assistance for these key public health activities. For example, in Kenya, roughly 20 percent of clinics said they received support for providing childhood vaccinations, 36 percent said they received support for HIV/AIDS preven-tion, and about 25 percent said they received support for malaria or tuberculosis activities. In Ghana, government engagement with the private health sector for these key health activities is even lower. Only 12 percent of private clinics received nancial or technical assistance for child- hood vaccinations and only about 15 percent received assis-tance for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs. These data suggest that existing government engagement with the private health sector for key public health activities is relatively limited. Increasing the level of engagement is likely to provide signi cant bene ts, given that a large share of the popula- tion in Ghana and Kenya, and Sub-Saharan Africa more generally, accesses health care at private facilities. Since a signi cant share of low-income households seeks health care from private facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa (see Observation 2, above), by targeting only public facilities, a signi cant fraction of the poor population may not bene t from public health interventions. This is especially unfortu-nate in light of the scarce available resources for such interventions, since in effect excluding indigent patients of private providers is likely to decrease the returns on the public funds spent.

The best ways to ensure quality of care are through midwifery training programs or through obstetricians where they exist, the nancing of private-practice establishment, franchising, and strengthening accreditation. 83 In addition to the positive effects of the inclu- sion of the private health sector in interventions, the opposite has been documented: when inter-ventions are designed and implemented without the private health sector in mind, they are less effective. Box 1.3 presents an example in the area of child health. What Happens When We Ignore the Private Health Sector? BOX 1.3 An example of what happens when we ignore the private health sector is the Inte- grated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) program, which is designed to promote improve-ments in child health in developing countries. It is based on the concept that treatment of the common childhood illnesses should be provided in an integrated and holistic manner, maximizing the health bene ts of each contact the sick child has with public health facilities. IMCI was widely introduced between 1996 and 2001 in most countries with moderate-to-high levels of child mortality and formally targeted three areas: (a) the quality of clinical care, (b) the functional-ity of basic facilities, and (c) the effectiveness of outreach activities. This usually involved the training of frontline staff in how to treat the most common childhood illnesses, public facility improvements such as staff supervision and drug availability, and efforts to expand commu-nity education about good health practices in the home.The IMCI program encountered several strate- gic and systemic failings. Most important, how-ever, it failed to expand community outreach activities or achieve sustainable results. While treatment quality in frontline public clinics has improved in some countries, measurable improve-ments in child health attributable to IMCI have only been found in Tanzania. Equally critically, the program has generally not explored the role and potential contribution of the private sector, because the IMCI approach has really only included activities to improve services provided in public clinics, even in countries where private pro-viders were actually seeing the large majority of sick children. Program designers apparently believed that if they could substantially improve the services offered, the large number of people who were going elsewhere (or not seeking care) would quickly switch to them. But much evidence shows that people continue to go to providers in the community that they trust and nd conve- nient\u2014and these providers are very often private.

Misoprostol's potential use as an abortifacient has led to black market sales of the drug. Well-intentioned distribution of miso-prostol to prevent maternal hemorrhage without safeguards could trigger removal of the drug in settings where anti-abortion activ-ists are likely to exploit any evidence of misoprostol diversion. Healthy Partnerships | 25 Contracting or purchasing A major, recurring question is whether the private sector should be employed to deliver health care goods and services on behalf of the public sector. While this is only one part of engagement, the results from our research show the relationship between the public and private health sectors is frequently dominated by that question. Interest has been growing in nancing mechanisms that focus more on outputs or the services produced, and less on the inputs or the costs associated with operating a facility, for example. The private health sector is far more inclined to organize seri-ously and work with the government if there is a realistic chance of being contracted to provide clinical services. From the government's perspec-tive, purchasing services from providers, whether public or private, offers an alternative to simply allocating budgetary funds to public facilities. The government can also use limited resources on the most needed services, choosing fl exibly from pub- lic or private facilities. However, such nancing arrangements also require the capacity to oversee them. Practical toolkits have been developed to help governments with contracting. 84 Impressive results have been recorded when purchasing or contracting is done well. A system-atic review of studies in developing countries 85 identi ed eight cases that showed measured improvements in quality, access, or both, from contracting services in maternal and child health. Indeed, the studies found that contracting improved coverage in all cases, even in poor and remote areas, with median coverage increasing in program areas by 3.4 percent to 26.0 percent over control areas. Based on measures of both coverage and quality of care, six of the studies found that contractors were more effective than government providers. An evaluation of Rwanda's pay-for-performance (P4P) scheme by Basinga et al. (2001) found statistically signi cant improve- ments in the maternal and neonatal health indica-tors of institutional delivery and quality of prenatal care, which increased by 21.0 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively, over the baseline in the P4P districts. 86 Dangers of excessive engagement Not all government intervention or engagement is benign. As we advocate for improved government engagement with the private health sector, it is important to acknowledge that potentially nega-tive impacts from inappropriate intervention by the government are real. Some governments fail in their basic duties to provide oversight in the economy. This can be a matter of capacity, but also of corruption or willful neglect. In consider-ing the options for effective engagement, such constraints must be taken into account. Examples of such inappropriate intervention, often in the form of excessive rules, abound in Africa for the private health sector. Section 2 presents a number of these examples. Beyond the health sector, much of the work on improving the investment climate in developing countries focuses on keeping the points of contact between the government and the private sector to a necessary minimum (box 1.4). Each contact point is an opportunity for delays, arbitrary appli-cation of rules, graft, or for capacity constraints by the government to impede the development of the private sector. When it comes to health care, not every additional contribution by the private sector requires more government involvement. In Mauritania, only citizens can own private health sector facilities and only citizens of a few addi-tional countries can freely work in them. This has thwarted the attempts by foreign investors and physicians to set up much-needed private clinics. In Comoros and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the private health sector has faced tax increases and has been denied investment incen-tives, burdens that were not infl icted on the pri- vate sector more generally. 87 There is a ne line between government engagement with the private sector and burden-some intrusion. Greater attention to improved engagement is to be understood relative to the current, prevailing approach to engagement in the region. The appropriate amount and type of engagement is de ned in the regional context, as box 1.4 discusses in more detail.26 | Healthy PartnershipsNot all oversight requires government intervention The government is not always best placed to ll an oversight role of the private health sector. Indeed, self-regulation and third-party accreditation have often proven to be more effective. 88 A prominent example from the United States is The Joint Com-mission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organiza-tions, which was created by American and Canadian medical professionals and hospital asso-ciations to provide voluntary accreditation for health facilities. The Joint Commission accredits and certi es more than 18,000 health care organi- zations and programs in the United States. Joint Commission accreditation and certi cation is rec- ognized nationwide as a symbol of quality that refl ects an organization's commitment to meeting certain performance standards. 89 Examples of successful self-regulation can also be found in Latin America.90 In the Dominican Republic, a coordinating organization for more than 100 NGOs, INSALUD, participates in the National Commission for NGO Quali cation and Accreditation. It works in partnership with the government to ensure that NGOs receiving pub-lic funding comply with minimum requirements, standards, and norms. Similarly, the Ministry of Health in El Salvador contracted with an NGO to establish quality-of-care requirements and assess compliance. Similar examples from Africa, where self- regulation is slowly becoming more widespread, are discussed in Section 2. Social franchising, a particular form of accreditation carried out with-out government infl uence or control, is discussed in box 1.5. How Much Engagement Is the Right Amount? BOX 1.4 The framework for assessing engagement was designed to be relevant in the African context (see Appendixes 3 and 4 for more details on the framework and the indicators). In general, public-private engagement in Africa is very low, so we looked for the presence of the most basic build-ing blocks. The goal was not to assess and con-trast sophisticated levels of engagement, but to identify policies that provide the foundation for a basic level of interaction. This approach makes sense for two reasons: (a) the observed variation in levels of engagement in Africa suggests this is the appropriate level to focus on for now, and (b) we can safely say that these building blocks are important for health systems with a sizable pri-vate sector. By extension, Africa's mixed public-private health systems are more likely to perform better when these basic elements are in place.This framework is less relevant for most West- ern European countries, where these basic build-ing blocks have been in place for decades, and the level of engagement is advanced. As one senior of cial at the OECD noted, the private health sec- tor in OECD countries \"cannot breathe without the government being involved.\" There is, of course, an ongoing debate about the appropriate level of engagement in OECD countries as well; in some instances, there may be too much of it. Notwithstanding these caveats, the frame- work provides useful and important insights also for the health systems in Africa's higher-income countries, such as Botswana, Mauritius, and South Africa. They are more akin to OECD coun-tries in terms of the organizational capacities of the private and public health sector. And yet, while these countries receive fairly good scores in general, our assessments still highlight areas where engagement can and should be improved. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. Healthy Partnerships | 27 Obstacles to engagement, especially at the systems level Engagement between the public and the private health sectors does not happen automatically, and cannot happen without political will. For both sides, signi cant obstacles exist. The transaction costs of engaging remain high and, as others have pointed out, 91 developing effective government engagement with the private sector is challenging. Many questions remain. From the government's side, the obstacles to engagement include limited capacity on the one hand and a relative lack of incentives to engage on the other. In addition, there is a lack of trust, as we discuss below. This Report argues that precisely because the government's capacity is limited, smart engagement with the private sector\u2014for example, to kick-start a productive dialogue\u2014is worthwhile, despite the up-front costs. Incentives for the government to engage may also be missing, due either to confl ict of interest (the Ministry of Health has responsibility not just for setting policy but also for managing public providers of health care services) or because of the structure of donor-funded programs. Engagement must begin with recognition of the size of the private sector, and a willingness to set aside stereotypes, especially with regard to for-pro t or self- nancing provid- ers. Interviews conducted for this Report revealed a lingering suspicion of the for-pro t health sector in many, though not all, countries in the region. Yet, many private providers offer good-quality services to patients who need them, extending access well beyond the reach of underfunded gov-ernment providers. Notwithstanding our relative focus on the role of the government, engagement is a two-way pro-cess. Intermediaries, such as health insurance authorities, may even turn engagement into a multiparty process. But certainly private providers must be ready to reciprocate when the govern-ment extends a hand, even if the hand is not com-pletely open and was, perhaps, partly forced by international donors. Part of the engagement (Social) Franchising as a Way to Expand Quality Improvements BOX 1.5 Franchising is the use of a successful business model and common brand across several rms. For private health providers, it can be a good approach to bene t from brand recogni- tion in exchange for adhering to strict standards in terms of quality processes, prices, or both. A derivation of this concept is called social fran-chising, in which a successfully tested model of service delivery is offered by the franchisor. The participating providers, or franchisees, replicate the model and often receive assistance to ensure they are able to adhere to the required stan-dards. The social goal, sometimes coupled with subsidies for the service delivery, is a particular element of this approach. However, as in com-mercial franchising, the participating rms in social franchising can capitalize on a recogniz-able brand name or logo that identi es partici- pating service delivery points to consumers. In return, the franchisees are obligated to comply with quality standards, report sales and service statistics, and, in some cases, pay franchise fees. Social franchise models of service delivery exist in several African countries. Many of the wider networks focus on provision of family planning and reproductive health services; others provide general health care services. Whether the private provider operates fully under the auspices of the franchise or not, the training received has been found to improve quality of those services cov-ered. This is expected to diffuse into the other aspects of care offered by these providers. Although the current evidence for the effective-ness of social franchising as a quality improve-ment tool is limited, preliminary results from pro-gram evaluation suggest that the model holds considerable promise.

For private providers, engagement can be dif - cult if there is no organization to coordinate the effort, and because of the time and effort required to attend meetings, review documents, and so forth. The private sector is typically diverse, and it is this diversity that makes organization dif cult. The cost of engaging can be especially prohibitive if the private health sector does not clearly under-stand what the bene ts will be.Trust and predictability as key ingredients Trust among government, the private sector, and intermediaries is essential92 for a productive oper- ating environment. Stability within government is a critical rst step to increasing trust and improv- ing public-private collaboration. 93 Conversely, uncertainty has a negative effect on business investments. Along with inappropriate policies and practices, which we discuss in Section 2, unpredictable changes in taxation, legislation, reg-ulatory enforcement, and subsidy allocations are a major obstacle to scaled-up investments. Such changes create instability in private health deliv-ery markets in Africa, increasing the cost of capital and slowing both investment and growth. 94 The high degree of authority vested in governmental leadership in many African countries means changes in government often result in about-faces on legislation, partnerships, or developing rela-tionships. In Sierra Leone, for example, a public-private partnership, which had been initiated by the private sector itself, aimed to create a dialysis center in a government hospital, for the private and public sectors to use jointly. Even though room had been allocated and the equipment had been purchased, the partnership was abandoned because of a change in leadership at the Ministry of Health. 95 Instability resulting from change at the Minis- try of Health is a common problem in the region. The Gambia had four health ministers, ve per- manent secretaries, and three directors during 2009 alone. In Niger, the Minister of Health changed 10 times in seven years (2003 to 2010). In several countries in the region, the average ten-ure of health ministers is a mere six or seven months. Adding to the instability, distrust between the public and private sectors remains a hindrance, and partly prevents the allocation of public resources to the private sector commensurate with the scale of private nancing and provision. 96 Perceived pro t motives by the private sector remain a limiting factor on contracting, facilitat-ing legislation, and formal recognition by govern-ments, leading to unregistered facilities and dual Healthy Partnerships | 29 practice (that is, working in both the public and private sectors), among government-employed clinicians. 97 Private practitioners, themselves, fur- ther distrust government for fear of regulation, taxation, or rent taking by formal or informal means. 98 When nonstate providers operate with- out security or predictability, the incentives for growth and investment are sharply curtailed. 99 Corruption, whether real or perceived, is a major impediment to government engagement with the private sector in many countries. 100 When real, it introduces tremendous inef ciencies and disincentives into the health market, which increases operating costs for private providers, reduces quality because of nontransparent criteria for subsidy and operation, and greatly increases the barriers to entry and expansion of care-providing entities. Whether real or perceived, corruption reduces trust and transparency in the relationship between government and private partners and so limits the effectiveness of the engagement. Building trust and predictability Despite these impediments, improvements in trust between the public and private health sec-tors is not only possible but is actually happening in several countries, leading to increased dia-logue. In Ghana, Kenya, and Mali, for example, dialogue has evolved from the exchange of gen-eral thoughts and priorities to speci c instances of collaboration and reform. In Mauritius, the government is actively courting professionals and investors from the private health sector, both domestically and internationally, to further develop high-quality health services. In other countries, the process of rebuilding trust and predictability is not far behind. The recognition of mutual reservations can be a positive initial outcome of such a process. On the private sector side, it is a matter of getting past the view that the government is responsible for everything yet lacks the capacity or will to do any-thing. On the government side, it is a matter of rejecting the notion that the private sector is only interested in pro t and lacks the ability or willing- ness to work toward public health goals in good faith. Surrendering or softening such views and gaining a basic understanding of the nancial and organizational constraints of both parties is the rst step toward real engagement. Building sustained partnerships between the government and the private health sector is a two-way process. Ultimately, engagement will yield positive results only if both the public and private sectors are willing to work together and are com-mitted to furthering public-private collaboration. In Section 2, we examine engagement from the government perspective rst: How should the steward of the health system approach this issue? In the latter part of Section 2, we highlight the role the private health sector itself must play in the engagement process. 30 | Healthy Partnerships Healthy Partnerships | 31 Section 2: What our research tells us about engagement There is at least some government engage- ment with the private health sector in every country, evidenced in examples of public- private collaboration to improve the quality, accessibility, and ef ciency of health care. At the same time, the overall level of engagement is low in many countries, and there is a noticeable lack of engagement with for-pro t or self- nancing providers. Policy makers are becoming increasingly aware of this, and are looking for ways to increase and improve collaboration. Many opportunities exist, and it will be up to policy makers to follow through. This section analyzes how governments are currently engaging private providers within the context of the ve domains discussed earlier. The results, a summary of which are presented in table 2.1, are based on original research con-ducted for this Report. ix The overall messages are as follows: \u0081 Government engagement at the systems level is underway.Governments are already working with the private health sector, to some degree. Nota-ble examples include widespread collabora-tion with faith-based organizations (FBOs) and with private providers for speci c disease or immunization programs. \u0081 The level of engagement with self- nancing providers is low. Government engagement with for-pro t pro- viders at the systems level needs urgent improvement. Even though policies may be in place for engaging such providers, imple-mentation is generally weak, and self- nanc- ing providers often are not included unless connected to a speci c disease or immuniza-From Dakar to Dar es Salaam, policy makers across the Sub-Saharan Africa region are searching for effec- tive ways to tackle the most pressing health challenges. As Section 1 noted, part of the solution will be to engage all actors in the health system, including the private sector. TABLE 2.1 A Brief Glance at the Results Policy and dialogue Governments have private health sector policies in place, but implementation is a challenge; more dialogue is required to improve collaboration. Information exchange Information exchange is weak and needs to improve, but there is good cooperation for disease surveillance. Regulation Private sector regulations are in place but may be outdated or inconsistent; enforcing regulations is a major problem. Financing Governments are using some (limited) nancing to engage providers in many countries and are open to more. Public provision of services There is good cooperation on referral systems and immunization and other disease programs. ix. Unless otherwise stated, all data cited in Section 2 are based on the \"Healthy Partnerships\" Report data collection, carried out between February and July 2010.32 | Healthy Partnershipstion program. (See box 2.1 for a brief discus- sion of why we concentrate on self- nancing providers.) \u0081 There is much opportunity for increasing systemic public-private collaboration.Further engagement is not a question of rein-venting the wheel. If governments seek to leverage the capabilities of the private health sector, much can be achieved by including pri-vate providers in already existing arrangements. Data collection and assessment framework This section provides background on the assess-ment framework used to measure engagement. As noted in the introduction, data were collected in 45 countries between February and July 2010 through in-country visits. The results presented here are based on interviews with more than 750 government of cials, policy makers, regulators, pri- vate providers, and other experts across the region. As explained, the assessment framework developed to measure government engagement includes ve domains, each describing a key aspect of the government's relationship with the private health sector. Each domain can be seen as bidirectional, that is, to and from the pri-vate sector, and each interacts with the others. The policy and dialogue domain concerns the underlying policy framework for the private health sector and its implementation, and the level of dialogue between the public and private sectors. The other domains cover the range of policy instruments that governments can use to engage private providers: information exchange, regulation, nancing, and public provision of services. More information on the methods behind the engagement data, including the selection of indicators, and on the conceptual development of the framework, can be found in Appendixes 3 and 4. The overall assessment framework is shown in table 2.2. Since engagement consists of both policy and its implementation, the framework contains both de jure and de facto indicators to fully capture how governments are engaging private providers. De jure indicators rely on fact-based measures that focus on the existence of policies, laws, or regulations. De facto indica-tors are based on expert opinion of policy imple-mentation or inclusion of private providers in government programs or structures. Placing the Focus on the Self-Financing Providers BOX 2.1 The results presented in this chapter refer to government engagement with the for-pro t or self- nancing sector only. They do not analyze engagement with the nonpro t sector. There is more engagement with the nonpro t sector than self- nancing providers across all domains in all countries. In many countries, FBOs are indistinguishable from the public sector. Many FBO facilities serve as pub-lic reference hospitals. The high level of integration between the public sector and FBOs makes cross-country analysis dif cult because FBOs are considered an extension of the public sector in many coun- tries. Their partnership is discussed in more detail at the end of this section. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.

Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.34 | Healthy PartnershipsResults The policy and dialogue domain presents an encouraging picture, overall. A number of coun-tries score highly by combining a good private sec-tor policy framework with implementation in practice. The top performers include more devel-oped countries like Mauritius and South Africa, but also low-income states like Burkina Faso and Rwanda ( gure 2.2). This suggests that not just resources, but also a broader commitment to engagement, backed by positive actions, are important to successful engagement. The difference in performance among coun- tries is generally the degree of implementation. Although many countries have policies or dia-logue mechanisms, implementation is a big challenge and is lacking in many places. For example, Zambia has a number of private health sector initiatives, including a public-private partnership (PPP) policy and a task force to pro-mote PPPs. It also held a private health sector trade fair. Implementation, however, is lacking for various reasons, including an uneven politi-cal environment. Implementation of any policy is dif cult, not just in Zambia, but also in coun-Good Practice Example on Policy and Dialogue: Ghana BOX 2.2 The level of engagement between the Government of Ghana and the private health sector has greatly increased in recent years. While implementation, for example of suitable regulation, is not yet where it should be, it is an example of good practice in the domain of policy and dialogue. The Ghana Private Health Sector Pol-icy prescribes in detail how the public and private sectors can work together to meet national health priorities. It covers the key issues affecting private sector growth and participation in the health sector, the rationale and objec-tives of the policy, the speci c policy areas for public-pri- vate collaboration, and strategies for implementation. It also details the composition and capacity of the private sector.This policy has been implemented on various fronts, most prominently with the inclusion of private providers in the Ghana National Health Insurance Scheme. Though many challenges remain, respondents noted the positive impact of the recently revived dialogue process. Even though the private sector policy existed before, it was not until the recent reactivation of the dialogue that the policy really became operational. The private sector, in turn, has responded by forming an umbrella organization of private providers, with the representatives coming from the health subsectors and professional groups.

Healthy Partnerships | 35 tries such as The Gambia and Niger, where health ministers and permanent secretaries change frequently and with them their priori-ties and their views on the private health sector. Across the region, the overall picture remains broadly positive, however, and most policy mak-ers understand the need to make tangible public-private collaboration a priority. Private sector policies are often in place The majority of countries in the region (more than 85 percent) have a private health sector pol-icy. Both Ghana and Sudan stand out for having speci c stand-alone policies (indeed, Sudan has two policies\u2014one for the self- nancing or for- pro t sector and one for the nonpro t sector). Other countries are moving toward a speci c pol- icy, even though the private health sector is already included in other strategic documents. In South Africa, the public and private sectors are jointly developing a \"Charter for the Public and Private Health Sector s.\" Both Ethiopia and Uganda are in the process of ratifying stand-alone policies, and Mali and the Republic of Congo are currently drafting a speci c policy. Elsewhere, private health sector policy is usu- ally contained within the Ministry of Health's strategic plan. The level of detail regarding the private health sector in such documents varies. For example, in Angola, the policy is found in an addendum to the national constitution and sim-ply recognizes the role of the private health sec-tor. By contrast, the Tanzanian private sector is given a prominent role in the country's strategic plan. Going beyond simple recognition, it details the role private providers can play in the coun-try's overall health strategy. It also sets out poten-tial areas for public-private collaboration to achieve national health goals. Six countries do not have a private sector policy for health. This does not necessarily mean that there is no engagement in practice, but that such engagement neither bene ts from a guid- ing document nor is underpinned by a policy framework. This makes good engagement all the more dif cult. As the assessment framework suggests, the majority of countries without a policy perform less well across the domains. Implementing the policies is a big challenge While having a private health sector policy is an element of good engagement, implementation matters more. Countries can generally be placed into one of four groups, as gure 2.3 indicates. Countries in the two upper bars in gure 2.3 implement policy well. A snapshot of Rwanda illustrates this. All Rwandan health policy and strategy documents over the last several years include the private health sector. The latest stra-tegic plan (2009-12) states the importance of \"engaging all private providers to improve access and quality.\" To further this end, the Ministry of Health has created the Private Medicine desk to act as the focal point for private providers. In terms of implementation, there is a clear com-mitment to following the policy. The public sec-tor has explicitly included private providers in a range of major public health initiatives, includ-ing for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), family planning, and human resources for health. In the area of health nancing, there is also close public-pri- vate collaboration. Private providers are involved in the government's performance-based nancing program, and they can apply for accreditation to participate in the public health insurance scheme that covers 86 percent of the population.

Leso-tho boasts many examples of constructive public-private collaboration, most prominently the PPP developed for the new Queen Elizabeth II Hospi-tal. In the Seychelles, where most people go to a well-run public sector, and where the private sec-tor is small (less than 10 private providers), the Ministry of Health has developed areas of collabo-ration with private providers when needed, with-out explicit guidance or reference in the overall health sector plan or strategy. Countries in the two lower columns in gure 2.3\u2014approximately 75 percent of those studied\u2014have dif culty implementing a private sector health policy, if one exists. The majority of countries t this category. While some public- private collaboration may exist in these coun-tries\u2014for example, with disease programs or referral processes\u2014implementation at the sys-tems level is poor when measured against stated policy intentions. Governments are missing sig-ni cant opportunities to engage or include the private sector. Dialogue mechanisms but a lack of dialogue Ongoing dialogue between the public and private sectors is a key element of good engagement, and a speci c public-private dialogue mechanism can help institutionalize the process. Approximately 50 percent of countries have a mechanism at pres- ent, in a wide variety of forms. In Ghana and Kenya, for example, a speci c public-private health sector mechanism is in place to further develop collaboration. Dialogue mechanisms should be the rst step in countries without a strong foundation of public-private engagement. In Mali and the Republic of Congo, a dialogue mechanism was put in place to build momentum for future collaboration. Elsewhere, in the absence of a speci c mecha- nism, the private health sector is often included in a larger dialogue mechanism that includes all actors in the health sector. In Uganda, the private health sector plays a prominent role in the national health coordinating mechanism that meets four times per year. Private providers in Rwanda take part in an annual meeting with all stakeholders to review progress and chart strate-gies and priorities for the following year. Even though a dialogue mechanism is a sign of good engagement, actual levels of communi-cation are low in many places, as gure 2.4 indi- cates. Strong levels of dialogue exist in Kenya and Mauritius, with Ghana and another 13 coun-tries following close behind with reasonable lev-els. In the top-performing countries, there is constant dialogue between the public and pri-vate sectors\u2014often not just through a mecha-nism, but also through private sector involvement in Ministry of Health committees or other forums. In Mauritius, the private sector has been involved in Ministry of Health committees for nutrition, tobacco, and contingency planning. Many of those interviewed for this report said increased dialogue improved trust between the public and private sectors and provided a foun-dation for systemic engagement. The majority of countries that have strong or reasonable levels of dialogue perform notably well across all the domains. This is as we had expected, since a pol-icy framework established outside of a dialogue with the private health sector is unlikely to be supported by action in the longer term. Beyond these countries, levels of public- private dialogue overall are low. A substantial number of countries (18) have poor communi- FIGURE 2.4 Dialogue in Practice Strong dialogue Ongoing dialogue; room for improvement Some dialogue; weak overallVery low dialogue or no ongoing dialogue2 1411 18 Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. Healthy Partnerships | 37 cation, held back in some instances by the absence of a public-private mechanism. Most dialogue in these countries is ad hoc or occurs only when considered necessary, for example, during a disease outbreak. In such cases, the dia-logue is usually the product of a donor mandate, such as from the Global Fund related to public-private collaboration on HIV/AIDS, TB, or malaria. Respondents in several countries, such as Botswana and Madagascar, said public-private dialogue occurs primarily or even exclusively within such programs. Although outcomes of the dialogue process were not measured, respondents in a few coun-tries said the extensive time and effort involved in fostering communication did not result in tan-gible public-private collaboration. In Niger, the public and private sectors have met frequently to develop a \"contracting strategy\" within the 2005 Health Development Plan. Since then, however, no practical steps have been taken to implement this strategy, even though regular meetings con-tinued for some time. It was not obvious what all the root causes of this inaction were. Since then, much momentum has been lost and, as a result, private providers have stopped attending meet-ings. Although Niger is one example of how implementation can fail, respondents in other countries noted a similar feeling as it became clear no action was forthcoming. The driving force behind a dialogue mechanism should be tangible public-private collaboration, not simply talk and no results. Information exchange The information exchange domain concerns infor-mation fl ows between the public and private sec- tors, and private sector inclusion in governmental programs for national health management infor-mation systems (HMIS) and disease surveillance. See gure 2.5 for description of good practice and summary of results in policy and dialogue. The better-performing countries in this domain (score of 6 or more out of 8) are Mauritius, the Seychelles, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Liberia, and Rwanda. See box 2.3 for a good prac-tice example in Burkina Faso.Results The exchange of information between the public and private sectors is generally weak across the region. As gure 2.6 shows, few countries have a comprehensive information exchange. Those that perform best in this domain, such as Burkina Faso and Rwanda, keep the private sector well informed and include private providers in existing public information channels, such as for HMIS data. The weak information exchange in many countries is a concern to both public and private providers, albeit for different reasons. The public sector must be aware of what is happening in the private sec-tor to have a more complete picture of how the health system is performing. The private sector needs to be kept up to date on issues that affect its operating environment. Respondents in nearly every country noted the need to improve infor-mation exchange, especially given its relevance for the other domains. FIGURE 2.5 Good Practice and Results in Information Exchange Good practice in this domain is to have ve elements in place: \u0081 Information fl ows between the government and the private health sector, in both directions. \u0081 There is a legal requirement for the private health sector to provide health-related data. \u0081 The information from the private sector actually reaches the government. \u0081 The private health sector is included in a country's national disease surveillance program. \u0081 The government sends out regular surveillance updates to the private sector. Our research revealed the following: \u0081 Information exchange is weak in most countries; a majority of countries have less than half of their basic elements in place. \u0081 Private provider data are not reaching the government, despite legal requirements. \u0081 There are somewhat higher levels of inclusion for disease-surveillance programs. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.38 | Healthy PartnershipsInformation fl ows across the region are very poor Governments do a poor job of keeping private providers informed of vital information. As g- ure 2.7 shows, only two countries\u2014Mauritius and the Seychelles\u2014have strong information fl ows, through which the government sends out information on changing regulations, treatment protocols, and other programs, while also receiv-ing feedback from the private sector. Another 12 countries are also quite strong in this domain. For example, in South Africa, the Department of Health website contains updated regulations and forms pertinent to the private sector. Elsewhere, information fl ows are weak, and government information channels do not routinely include the private health sector. In Cameroon, for example, a Ministry of Health of cial who also runs a private hospital said he only became aware of certain regulations that should have guided his private practice when he started working for the ministry. In almost a third of countries, there is no tangible information exchange between the Good Practice Example: Burkina Faso BOX 2.3 In citing an example of good practice, information exchange was assessed as being poor in almost all countries in the region. Among them, Burkina Faso made some positive changes and seems to be addressing remaining issues. In recent years, the government has made a concerted effort to improve the policy and regula-tory environment for the private sector, in general. A few years ago, the Ministry of Health established a Public Pri-vate Dialogue Framework and a Private Sector Directorate at the central level, which has dedicated staff at the dis-trict level who act as focal points for the private sector. In the wake of these reform efforts, there is a consensus among respondents that the exchange of information is reasonably good and will continue to improve. The key to a strong information exchange is not to create parallel structures for private providers, but to include them in already existing arrangements. In Burkina Faso, the private sector is required to provide information, and the compliance rates with this requirement seem to be good (estimated at 80 percent by some respondents, with a consensus that a majority complies). The private sector is generally included in the disease surveillance program, though larger clinics are curiously less represented. The Ministry of Health has a toll-free number for reporting emergencies, but it is currently available to only a fraction of the private health sector. Although the government does not report disaggregated data for the public and private sectors, the private health sector is generally kept informed. A recent decision by the general tax directorate recog- nized private health facilities as \"civil enterprises,\" thereby allowing them to avoid a commercial label for tax purposes. This change likely contributes to the relatively good rela-tionship between the government and the private sector and, in turn, is likely a positive infl uence on the high levels of compliance with information provision.

Healthy Partnerships | 39 public and private sectors. Private providers in Burundi said they received no information at all from the Ministry of Health. In Sudan, private providers said health inspectors visit facilities bearing regulations and guidelines they have never seen before. In one instance, a private provider said he had not heard of the new private sector health policy. In such circumstances, it is dif cult to expect the private health sector to comply with regulations or use treatment guidelines of which they have not been informed. See box 2.4 for an example of a marked improvement of informa-tion exchange under special circumstances. Private providers' data is not reaching the Ministry of Health Since the private health sector provides a sizable percentage of care in many countries, collecting key HMIS data is necessary to give policy mak-ers a full picture of national trends. Most coun-tries require private rms to provide HMIS data, but in practice few do. Figure 2.8 shows that, of the countries where private providers are required to provide data, only a small number actually do so. In a few countries, no require-ment even exists. The lack of private sector data is a concern for policy makers, especially in countries where pri-vate operators supply a large percentage of care. In Uganda, the private sector provides up to 58 per-cent of health services, but compliance rates for HMIS data are less than 20 percent. In the Demo-cratic Republic of Congo, the private sector sup-plies 46 percent of care but the compliance rate is less than 10 percent. FIGURE 2.7 Information Flows Across the Region Strong, comprehensive information flows Ongoing reasonable information flows; room for improvement Weak information flows; restricted to subsectorsVery low or no ongoing information flows122 14 17 Good Collaboration for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa BOX 2.4 There is often no inherent reason why information exchange might be poor. We see this con rmed in instances where external events focus the efforts of the stakeholders. One example relates to the preparations for the World Cup 2010. The public and private sector in South Africa worked closely to prepare to host the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration International de Football Asso-ciation (FIFA) World Cup. Among other things, the government created an online \"Noti able Medical Conditions Early Warning Surveillance System,\" where the private sector (and the general public) could track and upload incidences of disease outbreak. However, when compliance with provision of data is incentivized by the provision of consum-ables like anti-retroviral drugs or vaccines, the pri-vate providers have been found to comply well. Medicines or vaccines are provided to private health facilities on the condition that they report how much has been delivered and to whom. Such improved compliance was observed as a part of donor-funded HIV treatment programs, as well as regular public health interventions. For example, in the city of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, the munici-pal health department provides vaccines to pri-vate health facilities for distribution in exchange for timely provision of information. On a monthly basis, the facilities have been submitting informa-Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.40 | Healthy Partnershipstion on vaccine usage, which in turn gets aggre- gated at the national level. Including private providers in overall HMIS, however, is a challenge even in countries that per-form well in the information domain. Data from private health sector surveys in Ghana and Kenya provide a further glimpse of data provision rates for private hospitals and clinics. Table 2.3 shows that fewer than 50 percent of private clinics sub-mit their data on a regular basis in Kenya; this drops to just over a third in Ghana. These infor-mation gaps make it dif cult for the national Min- istry of Health to analyze how the health system is performing. Although the data submission rate is higher for private hospitals, there are fewer pri-vate hospitals than clinics across the region. For that reason, the hospitals tend to be more promi-nent and may even have contracts with the public sector, which would require the submission of information.Why is private health sector data not reaching the Ministry of Health? Many reasons were given to explain why private sector data are not reaching the government. In some countries, public and private respondents were not clear whether a requirement exists to provide HMIS data. This, predictably, prevented virtually any data from fl owing. Elsewhere, the information requirements are so heavy that many private providers simply do not comply. Table 2.4 shows the requirements for Burundi and Tanza-nia. In each of these countries, compliance rates are low, at least in part, because private providers see the requirement as exceptionally onerous. Tanzanian private providers said they had to dedi-cate one staff member to the task full time to compile all of the data. For smaller-scale clinics, this kind of resource commitment is simply not possible, so their data never reach the Ministry of Health. At the same time, some policy makers believe the requirements should be even higher. In Nigeria, a senior of cial stated that all facilities should provide all of their data on a weekly basis, even though most providers feel that the current monthly requirement is already excessive. In many other countries, there is no HMIS data exchange system in place. Many private respon-dents complain of the dif culty of providing information when no forms or guidance are pro-vided on how the data should be presented. Even when a system is in place, disagreements often arise. In Zambia, forms are provided to private providers, who then expect the Ministry of Health to come and collect the information. The Ministry of Health, on the other hand, says private provid-ers are responsible for bringing the data to them. The result is a stalemate in which no private sec-tor HMIS data are reaching the ministry.

Healthy Partnerships | 41 Private respondents were also dismayed at the lack of feedback in some countries. In Madagascar, interviewees said they hardly ever hear how their data are used after they take it to the local district health of ce. With so little feedback, they are not inclined to share their information with the government. In addition, there are nancial disincentives for some private providers to share information. In the Central African Republic and Niger, the tax rate for private health providers is linked to service utiliza-tion rates; that is, the more patients a facility treats, the higher the tax bracket. As a result, many facili-ties are reluctant to provide HMIS data to the Min-istry of Health. Resolving this issue is dif cult unless the disincentive is removed. Good levels of private sector inclusion in national disease surveillance programsx Private sector participation is better in national disease surveillance programs, and many respon-dents noted good public-private collaboration in this area. In two-thirds of the countries, private providers are included in the national surveillance programs. Even when they are included, however, private facilities are typically less involved than public facilities: disease surveillance of cers in Liberia visit all public clinics but only 40 percent of private facilities. In Mauritius, it is up to district health of cers to choose a small number of private providers to take part in the program. During emergencies or outbreaks, such as the H1N1 fl u epidemic, public-private collaboration in this area intensi es. Angolan private providers are still part of a special phone network\u2014a legacy of civil-war-era emergency information systems\u2014that permits the rapid transmission of surveillance information. Respondents in nearly every country said governments do a far better job of distributing information during disease outbreaks. In Mauri-tius, even small private facilities are invited to meetings to receive updates. While such infor-mation exchanges are an element of good engagement, the challenge is to elevate this to a more systematic approach. In Benin, for exam-ple, private providers are sent a disease surveil-lance report annually, but this is the exception and not the rule around the region. See box 2.5 for how Cape Verde handled communication during a dengue fever outbreak. Regulation The regulation domain focuses on the ability of the government to design and implement a regu-latory framework for the private health sector. As a proxy for all private health facilities, the focus is on private clinics. See gure 2.9 for description of good practice and summary of results in regulation. The top-performing countries in this domain (score of 11 or more out of 13) are South Africa, the Seychelles, Mauritius, and Namibia. See box 2.6 for a good practice example in South Africa. Results Most governments see regulation as the most important element of engagement with the pri-vate health sector. Regulation is clearly essential, but our research shows most governments have a dif cult time designing and implementing an ade- quate regulatory framework. Most countries do x. The most common type of disease surveillance program is one in which private providers are required to supply information only in cases of noti able diseases. The next-most-common program is one in which a percentage of facilities act as sentinel reporting units.Beating Dengue Fever in Cape Verde BOX 2.5 Cape Verde provides another example of how close collabo- ration is possible when the two sides are willing or moti- vated by external events. During a 2009 outbreak of dengue fever in Cape Verde, the public and private sectors\u2014including clinics, pharmacies, and laboratories\u2014were in constant contact, sharing information in real time to coordinate their response to the epidemic. Both public and private respondents said the close collaboration allowed them to contain the outbreak faster than they otherwise might have. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.42 | Healthy PartnershipsIt ensures that the Ministry of Health is aware of who is doing what in the health sector. Yet most governments are not aware of the scale of private provision of health services, as gure 2.11 sum- marizes. Only six countries across the region have a comprehensive registry. In these countries, the registry is a working document that is compre-hensive and updated frequently. This includes Cape Verde and the Seychelles, small countries with few private providers. These two island nations are the exception, not the rule. Most registries are woefully incomplete and often inaccurate. Some countries try to update their registries regularly but do not do a very good job. In Niger, for example, one government depart-ment said there was no list of private providers; a second department said one existed but only for pharmacies; a third claimed there was a list but it had not been updated since early 2009; and a fourth nally produced a reasonably updated list, but for the Niamey region only. In another coun-try, three public sector respondents named three different units responsible for the registry, and FIGURE 2.9 Good Practice and Results in Regulation Good practice in this domain is to have the following ten elements in place: \u0081 The government knows who is operating where, by way of a registry that is updated to contain all private facilities currently in operation. \u0081 The regulatory framework is well designed and appropriate.\u0081 Standardized, written rules exist for opening private health facilities.\u0081 There is an inspection process for private health facilities.\u0081 There is no explicit discrimination against private facilities in terms of quality oversight.\u0081 There is an effort to include all groups of providers that are relevant in the health sector (as a proxy, the focus is on traditional medicine) with a designated policy or of ce. \u0081 There is good enforcement of regulation.\u0081 An inspection process for private facilities is actually carried out.\u0081 There is a requirement for private health sector professionals to do continuing medical education (CME) before renewing their professional operating license. \u0081 CME training for public sector professionals is also open to health professionals from the private sector. Our research revealed the following: \u0081 The registry of functioning private providers is poor in most countries. \u0081 Regulations are often in place but are inappropriate or outdated in many cases.\u0081 The enforcement of regulations is weak across the region. not have a comprehensive list of private providers in their national health network. Regulations are usually in place, but they are frequently outdated or inappropriate and do not adequately address quality of care. Most of the problem, however, lies with enforcement of regulations. Most govern-ments lack the capability to exercise even a mini-mum amount of oversight. As gure 2.10 shows, only a handful of countries perform well in the regulation domain overall, and the results would be even worse if enforcement was weighted more heavily. Even private providers complained about the lack of regulatory oversight, which can have serious implications for quality of care: quacks can operate freely, damaging the reputation of the whole sector. The quality of private sector registries is extremely poor across the region The concerns with regulation across the region are encapsulated by the poor quality of the regis-tries of private clinics. An accurate registry is one of the fundamental elements of good engagement. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. Healthy Partnerships | 43 none could produce it. Other countries make only passing attempts to update their registry; Gabon's Ministry of Health does so only every three years. In a few countries, there is no working registry of any kind. Some governments think they are more aware of the scope of private sector activity than they really are, as illustrated by the situation in Mauritius described in box 2.7.Conditions are especially bad in countries with a large informal sector, where many providers are not registered and are largely out of sight of the government. Even many private providers said the informal sector needed to be supervised and regulated. Encouraging unregistered providers to come forward and engage with the government will be an important part of proper oversight of BOX 2.6 South Africa is unique in the Sub-Saharan health context in that its private health sector is regularly rated as one of the most advanced and best performing in the world. However, the private health sector is used by only 14 per-cent of the population, primarily the wealthy. Aside from the fact that the capacity of both government and private health organizations is high, the private sector is primarily funded through insurance. This builds in a strong incentive for compliance with rules and regulations. The strong legal and regulatory frameworks in place have ensured that there is a plethora of regulation in South Africa\u2014some would say overregulation. It has also led to a strong, at times even combative, private sector, which, in 2010, (suc-cessfully) took the Department of Health to court to ght a regulation that would have compelled them to use a refer-ence price list for pharmaceuticals. South Africa scores the maximum in terms of the ele- ments identi ed as good practice. Echoing the sentiment of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) of cial cited earlier in the report, one respondent said \"everything is regulated to the nth degree in South Africa.\" The registry of private facilities is fully updated. A con- tributing factor in South Africa is health insurance, since insurance companies can only reimburse facilities licensed by (and registered with) the Department of Health. Opin-ions diverged among respondents about the regulatory framework. Public sector respondents felt that there was too little or inappropriate regulation compared to other advanced economies, while private sector respondents felt that they were overregulated.Compared with other countries in the region, regulation is at an advanced level in South Africa, and there is consen-sus that the enforcement of regulation is generally good. Since enforcement is the responsibility of provincial depart-ments of health, the quality of enforcement varies some-what depending on the resources of the province (Gauteng and Western Cape have far more capacity than the Eastern Cape, for example). Respondents also felt that the inspection regime is gener- ally well designed on paper, and that in practice it is well coor-dinated, fair, and transparent. There is an initial inspection and subsequent annual inspections, and although some private sector respondents stated that they are treated more strictly than the public sector, there is no explicit discrimination. Opening a private health facility in South Africa follows standardized rules. Nonhealth professionals can open a pri-vate facility, and most private hospitals and clinics or chains of hospitals or clinics are owned by corporations listed on the stock exchange. Health professionals must register with the Health Professions Council every year and do continu-ing medical education (CME). Failure to comply with this requirement results in removal from the registry. This is strongly enforced because health insurance is only allowed, by law, to reimburse currently registered doctors. In line with World Health Organization recommendations, the Department of Health established a Directorate of Tradi-tional Medicine in 2006 and passed a Traditional Health Prac-titioners Act in 2007. The government has also provided fund-ing for research and development of how traditional practitioners can be integrated into disease control and man-agement programs. Good Practice Example: South Africa Source: \"Healthy 2010; Worrall-Clarre 2008.44 | Healthy Partnerships FIGURE 2.11 Quality of Registry of Private Clinics the entire private health sector. Health facility surveys that include all types of public and private providers are another way to address this need for better information in the shorter term. Regulations for basic functions are in place, but overall regulatory quality is poor Governments frequently have rules for basic health care functions. For example, all countries in the region have standardized regulations for open-ing a private health clinic and for monitoring or inspecting private facilities. Although this is an element of good engagement, it does not tell the whole story. Both public and private respondents in most countries say the quality of the regulatory framework is low, inconsistent, frequently out-dated, and full of gaps. Respondents are satis ed with the quality of the regulatory framework in only 15 percent of countries. In Mauritius, Namibia, and South Africa, for example, respondents said regulations address-ing clinical standards are based on current interna-tional best practice, and are updated regularly to ensure both public and private providers perform to the highest standards. A number of countries have begun to replace their outdated regulations. Benin, Equatorial Guinea, and Togo have imple-mented completely new private health sector frameworks. These have often been developed by engaging private providers and seeking their input during the development of the regulations. By contrast, respondents in 85 percent of countries we studied said the regulatory framework is inap-propriate. Some countries' regulatory frameworks for the private health sector have not been updated in nearly 50 years. Cameroon, Chad, and Lesotho, for example, have regulatory frameworks that date back over 40 years, and in the Democratic Repub-lic of Congo, the main regulations have not changed since before independence, in 1960. In other places, respondents believed regula- tions were inadequate. In S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe, for example, the only regulations for the private health sector pertain to opening a clinic. Else-where, the regulatory system for inspections\u2014which exists in every country\u2014is often not adequate to address quality of care.

Healthy Partnerships | 45 Private sector respondents also noted different quality standards for the public and private sector; more than half of countries make a clear distinc-tion between the two. In Ethiopia, the private sec-tor is held to stringent inspection standards, yet private respondents said public sector facilities would not pass similar inspections. This situation was noted elsewhere, including in Angola, where private providers said they were held to higher standards than their public counterparts. The regulatory framework should also include the entire range of actors found in the health sys-tem. What it means to have a comprehensive framework in place will differ among countries. Given the high importance of traditional medi-cine across the region and its existence at the relative fringes of the policy framework (that is, most of the rules, as well as the [self-]regulatory bodies deal with allopathic medicine only), the question of its inclusion in a country's policy framework becomes a useful proxy. Approximately 75 percent of countries have some form of policy or program to engage with providers of traditional medicine. Just as for the overall policy, however, the important part lies in the implementation, which was not assessed sepa-rately for traditional medicine policies. Having a policy for traditional medical practitioners (TMPs) is an important rst step though, because they are a major presence in many countries. In Swaziland, there are about 11,000 TMPs and only 200 physi-cians. In Equatorial Guinea, about 80 percent of people in need of treatment visit a TMP before going to a conventional doctor. The existence of a policy or program for this important group of pro-viders indicates the government has a compre-hensive framework for all private players, not just private clinics and pharmacies. No CME or renewal requirements and lack of CME opportunities Continuing medical education requirements for licensed health professionals are much in vogue and are a requirement in most developed health systems. However, they are currently a require-ment in only 20 percent of countries in our study. There is a clear need for reform of requirements for medical licenses in some countries. Some coun-tries do not require that medical licenses get renewed at all. In Senegal and Togo, among others, it is currently not necessary to renew a medical license, let alone to attend CME classes. A medical license is valid for life once granted. This stark omission is tempered somewhat by the recogni-tion among policy makers of the bene ts of CME requirements, and medical councils in several countries are planning to introduce them. Private providers can attend government CME training in two-thirds of the countries, allowing them to ful ll the requirement relatively easily. Actual attendance by private providers is, how-ever, rather low, often for avoidable reasons. Many providers in Lesotho complained about receiving invitations on the same day of the training, or BOX 2.7 Mauritius has a good regulatory framework and scores relatively well across the indicators. Yet there is a gap in oversight when it comes to registering private health care providers. A medical doctor in good standing (that is, one with a current registration with the Medical and Dental Council) can open a private practice without registering anywhere. This is not considered a clinic, for which there is a complete list, but merely a consultation room, for which the government has no list at all. This particular gap in the regulation is not refl ected in the scores, since our assessments are focused on the registry of clinics, but it exists all the same. It is a gap that should not matter much in a country where publicly provided health care is, in theory, available to all residents at no cost, as is the case in Mauritius. But, also in many other countries, anecdotal evidence suggests that despite the free care at public facilities, a signi cant proportion of care is provided through the individual providers, though exact gures or of cial statistics do not exist. The (In)Complete Registry in Mauritius Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.46 | Healthy Partnershipseven after the event had taken place. In Guinea, the level of disorganization of publicly offered training has forced private practitioners to go else-where in the region, or even to France, to access CME opportunities. Even in countries where a CME requirement exists, actual levels of participation can be low. Table 2.5 shows the percentage of private provid-ers who had been invited to public-sector CME training over the last three years in Ghana and Kenya. The gures for private clinics in both countries show that many private providers are not being invited to public sector training. Yet, both Ghana and Kenya have a CME requirement for medical doctors and courses offered to public sector professionals. The relatively low invitation rates in these two countries are emblematic of the experience of private providers in many countries across the region.Enforcement of regulations is a major problem Enforcement of health care regulations is poor almost everywhere in Africa. That regulation is well enforced in only six countries, based on our research, indicates the breadth of the problem. Indeed, most government respondents readily admitted regulations are not well enforced. Figure 2.12 highlights the lack of enforcement across the region. Although every country has written rules governing inspections, in practice they occur regularly in only ve countries. They take place infrequently in other countries, if at all. In Niger, for example, private respondents said no inspections had taken place in more than 10 years. A private provider in Madagascar said facilities had not been inspected in 15 years, even though they were located in the capital city. Elsewhere, inspections seemingly are only carried out if a problem is brought to the attention of the Minis-try of Health. Regulation can be especially dif cult if several agencies have overlapping oversight mandates for the sector. In Kenya, the Medical Practitioners and Dentistry Board, the Ministry of Health's Depart-ment of Standards and Regulation, and the local District Health Of ce all have some regulatory responsibility for the private health sector, but there is no clear agreement on who conducts BOX 2.8 There are clear differences across the region in the length of time it takes to open a clinic. For example, a clinic can be opened in a few days in Rwanda and Uganda, while respondents in Chad said a decision from the gov-ernment can take almost nine months. Given the delay, many providers ignore the of cial channels and open anyway. It should be noted that a standardized measure for ease of opening a private health clinic in Africa is not (yet) feasible, even though the time it takes to register a rm is considered an important proxy for assessing the general, nonhealth business environment (for example, the Doing Business indicator \"starting a business\"), as discussed in Section 1. Entry regulations for private health clinics vary dramatically among countries, and often within countries, depending on the size and type or service level of the facility. In some countries, the main registration requirements, and therefore the most time in the process, is dedicated to the professional accredita-tion; in other countries, such requirements and time for compliance are imposed primarily on the facility. De ning a unique case that would be a suitable proxy across the region is therefore not feasible. In addition, the data col-lection for such a measure would be tricky, since our data collection showed that typically only a few individuals know the existing requirements or how they are enforced in practice.

Healthy Partnerships | 47 inspections. In Lesotho, the Ministry of Health, the Maseru City Council, and the District Health team all have responsibility for inspecting private medi-cal facilities in the Maseru area, and all frequently expect the other to do it. Often, it is not done at all. On the fl ip side, District Medical Of cers in sev- eral countries are responsible for overseeing the quality of care in all public and private facilities in their district, while also being responsible for the management of public facilities. This dual role cre-ates a clear confl ict of interest for them. Lack of resources is a major reason regulations are not properly enforced in many countries, according to public-sector respondents. Table 2.6 illustrates this point. While resources are important, other coun- tries have tried various methods to improve enforcement of regulation. In Botswana and Ghana, inspections by the insurance authority for accreditation (to become eligible to receive reimbursements) have become the dominant oversight mechanism for the private health sec-tor. In Liberia, the Private Clinics Association ini-tiated discussions with the Liberia Medical Board to participate in the regulation of facilities run by health professionals who are not doctors. There is much need for this kind of oversight, because the Medical Board does not have the capacity to carry out the large-scale inspections needed to identify and bar unlicensed profes-sionals from practice. Initiative among larger providers who seek to improve their quality is on the rise among the African private health sector. One example is the sophisticated hospitals that are seeking recogni-tion for their efforts through accreditation by international accrediting bodies, as discussed in box 2.9. Financing The nancing domain covers the revenues that are actually or potentially available to the private health sector and the government's infl uence of such funds through various mechanisms. See g- ure 2.13 for description of good practice and summary of results in nancing. The top-performing countries in this domain (score of 4 or more out of 6) are Cape Verde, Rwanda, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Mauritania, Mauritius, and Sudan (Khartoum State). In the nancing domain, however, the mea- sures are imperfect proxies for the constructs they are designed to capture: strategic purchas-ing, attention to the investment climate, and access for the broader population to the care they seek. Developing better standardized mea-sures should be possible but was beyond the scope of this report, since more work is needed to obtain an accurate picture of this critical domain. In the meantime, however, the chosen proxies provide a good overview of the trends. We do not propose an overall good practice example here or show a heat map for the conti-nent. However, even though public nancing of private providers is contentious in terms of FIGURE 2.12 Inspections\u2014Paper Compared to Practice Inspection regime is not carried out 40 Inspection regime is carried out in practice5Inspection regime exists on paper 45TABLE 2.6 Resource Problems for Inspections Congo, Dem.

Uganda Private providers have to pay for inspectors to come and do the inspections if they want to open their clinic on time. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" Partnershipsoverall bene t to the health system, there is strong interest on the part of policy makers in further exploring ways to provide publicly nanced services through private providers (that is, public nancing of privately provided services), and it is undoubtedly a motivating factor for private providers. A critical dimension in nancing is nding an effective mechanism that lets poor people have access not only to public health services but also to private services, if that is where they seek care. This should not result in nancial ruin for the patient or in sustained losses for the private provider. Although, in principle, patients who cannot pay can be turned away, in practice, this is not easy to do. When someone cannot pay or things go wrong during the course of treatment, it is often the provider that has to bear the bur-den of the bad risk. It is often not easy to trans-fer or refer patients who cannot pay to a public facility. BOX 2.9 International Standards Organization (ISO) Certi cation The Nairobi Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, was opened in 1954. It has earned recognition as a center for medical practice excellence in many respects. The hospital has also demonstrated a commitment to delivering high-quality health care to its patients, by going beyond what was locally required to comply with international standards and acquire ISO's certi cations. It is ISO 9001:2008 certi ed; that is, its Quality Management System has been certi ed. In addition, the hospital achieved ISO 2200:2005 Food Safety Management System and ISO 14001:2004 Environ-mental Management System certi cations. The multiple certi cations show the commitment of the Nairobi Hospital management to quality improvement principles. ISO relies on the individual organization to establish, document, implement, and maintain a quality management system and continually improve its effectiveness.Joint Commission International (JCI) The JCI is the international arm of The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. It has accredited over 350 organizations outside the United States, where The Joint Commission was founded in 1951, and has accredited over 18,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. The International Clinical Laboratories in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was rst accredited by the JCI in 2004 and has been reaccredited twice. As of 2010, it was the only facility in Africa with JCI accreditation. Other facilities mentioned plans to acquire this mark of international quality, mostly to be able to attract patients from outside their borders.

FIGURE 2.13 Good Practice and Results in Financing Good practice in this domain is to have three elements in place: \u0081 The government is committed to improving the effectiveness of public funds by partly using the private sector to deliver services (existence of any ongoing contracts to pay private providers for services with public funds used as a proxy). \u0081 The government seeks to improve the investment climate for the private health sector (existence of any nancial incentives speci c to private health sector facilities as a proxy). \u0081 A signi cant part of the population can access the private health sector without having to pay out-of-pocket (the level of private provider coverage by public or private health insurance used as a proxy). Our research revealed the following: \u0081 A third of governments are contracting with self- nancing providers; half of those are also making nancial incentives available. \u0081 Another seven countries offer nancial incentives but no contracts. \u0081 The level of private provider coverage through health insurance is small but growing; a clear momentum is building. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. Healthy Partnerships | 49 Contracting is increasingly common, and policy makers are eager to explore it further Fifty percent of governments have contracts with private providers in a wide variety of forms, evi-dence that there is substantial collaboration between the public and private sectors. xi In sev- eral countries, public-private partnerships involve entire facilities, as table 2.7 highlights. Some countries practice smaller-scale con- tracting that involves speci c clinical services or procedures. In Rwanda, for example, the decen-tralization of budget management in the public sector has allowed public hospitals to subcon-tract some clinical services to private facilities. In Nigeria, what started out as an informal agree-ment between Lagos State University Teaching Hospital and Saint Nicholas Hospital has led to a formalized contract to carry out kidney trans-plants for the public sector. In Guinea-Bissau, governments have engaged private laboratories to perform tests for HIV patients. In Angola, the Ministry of Health has entered into several con-tracts with private providers for hemodialysis. Especially for smaller-scale contracting, both public and private respondents noted general satisfaction with the agreements in place. TABLE 2.7 Selected PPPs across the Region Lesotho A PPP hospital with Netcare (South Africa) is to replace the old Queen Elizabeth II Hospital. The PPP comprises the hospital and two satellite clinics. Madagascar The IMM Clinic in Antananarivo is a PPP between a private provider, General Electric Corporation (GE), and the government. The government supplied the building and GE supplied the equipment. A private provider manages the facility, which offers reduced-fee services. Nigeria Abuja's Garki Hospital is also a model PPP hospital, where a private provider manages a government structure. Patients get higher-quality services than at public hospitals and at cheaper rates than other private centers. South Africa The Settlers Hospital in the Eastern Cape is a PPP among Nalithemba Hospitals, Netcare, and the Eastern Cape Health Department. Previous collaborative efforts involving the group have resulted in the construction and successful running of Port Alfred Hospital. Sudan The Ministry of Health has turned over several public facilities to private providers for free in exchange for offering reduced-fee services to the public and helping to train Sudanese medical students. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. Note: PPP = public-private partnership.xi. The indicator only measured government contracting for clinical services and not contracts with the private sector for ancillary ser-vices in public facilities.Scarcity of specialized resources does not always lead to collaborative efforts, however. In Comoros, respondents recalled a time when a radiologist was not available at the main public sector hospital. Even though the expertise was available in the private sector, and private provid-ers were available to help, the Ministry of Health refused to enter into an agreement with them. As a result, respondents said the hospital could not perform surgeries for over two weeks. In other cases, governments have eschewed public-private collaboration in favor of competing with private providers. In Sudan, computerized tomography (CT) scans were only available in the private sector at a relatively high cost of US$100. This dropped to US$60 after the public sector purchased CT scanners and offered the service at US$50. Instead of compromising with the private sector to provide public CT scans, the govern-ment is now competing with the private sector. Some respondents said patients tend to prefer the private sector, even though it is more expensive. The Sudanese Ministry of Health does have an agreement with private providers for kidney dial-ysis treatment, however. 50 | Healthy PartnershipsFinancial incentives are sometimes available to private providers, but the private health sector is often treated harshly The range and scope of nancial incentives varies considerably across the region, but private provid-ers can access at least one incentive in 33 percent of countries. xii The most common types of incen- tives are duty exemptions, value added tax (VAT) exemptions, and general corporate tax exemp-tions, as shown in table 2.8. Some countries, such as Ethiopia and Rwanda, offer all of these incen-tives to private providers, while other countries are much less generous. Many private sector respondents, especially small clinics, said such incentives are often crucial to the nancial viabil- ity of their facility. They also should be easy to access. Private providers in Lesotho said the administrative burden for taking advantage of these incentives is so high that most private pro-viders prefer not to deal with them. Several countries have developed incentive programs to engage the private health sector stra-tegically. For example, both Ethiopia and Sudan offer incentives to private facilities that are willing to locate outside Addis Ababa or Khartoum. By offering reduced (or in some cases free) land and reduced property taxes, the government hopes to lessen the concentration of private providers in the capital city. Governments can also use an incentive program to ensure increased access for populations who could not otherwise afford it. In Madagascar, the government offers private pro-viders tax reductions if they agree to treat a cer-tain number of indigent patients. Elsewhere, the operating environment for pri- vate health providers is more dif cult. Private rms that nd themselves in such circumstances say it is not a case of seeking favors but of being treated the same as other private sector businesses (box 2.10). The Comorian government, for exam-ple, taxes the private health sector more heavily than other private sector businesses. Level of private provider coverage through health insurance at a glance As part of our data-collection effort, respon- dents were asked to estimate the percentage of people covered by health insurance schemes, whether public, private, or community based, that would reimburse for treatment received in a private facility. Table 2.9 provides a country breakdown of current coverage levels. For the most part, cover-age levels are low. In the four countries with cov-erage greater than 50 percent, the government has enacted a public insurance scheme that cov-ers the majority of citizens and allows them some access to private providers. Ghana and Rwanda are recent examples. Patients have the option of going to public or private facilities (which have to be accredited before they can participate), and the health insurance authority reimburses private providers. As the example of Tanzania shows, the private sector can become an important participant in public health schemes (box 2.11). While private sector respondents were mostly positive about taking part in insurance schemes, Ghanaian respondents noted instances of late reimbursements. Clearly, private sector partici-pation in public programs is dependent on being able to bill public insurers and being sure of timely reimbursement. Private participation can bring other bene ts. For example, the Botswana Insurance Authority plays an important role in fostering public-private dialogue and also col-lects data on service utilization in the private health sector. Only in Mauritius, Namibia, and South Africa are more than 10 percent of the population cov-ered by private\u2014as opposed to public\u2014schemes. Botswana and Senegal have small but growing TABLE 2.8 Most Common Incentives to Private Providers Type of incentive Incidence Duty exemptions on medicines or 17 medical equipment VAT exemptions 13 General tax exemptions 9 Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. Note: VAT = valud added tax. xii. We measured nancial incentives that are available speci cally to the private health sector. In addition, in a number of other coun-tries, private providers can bene t from general incentives offered to all private industry, even though there is nothing speci c to the private health sector. These countries are not included in this gure.

Note: \u2014 = not available.a. The table refl ects the answers of key respondents. The numbers have been veri ed through desk research and by consulting independent experts. They are not, however, intended to fully capture the complexities of health nancing (reimbursements that are available in theory may not fully cover expenses, for example, and, therefore, private providers may not accept them), and they do not take into account availability of public services without insurance. Rather, they show the level of private provider coverage through health insurance at the time of the data collection (Spring 2010), as de ned within each country. b. The wide range in the estimate for coverage of public insurance in Kenya (National Hospital Insurance Fund, NHIF) is based on two sources. While earlier studies based on Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data and interviewed experts estimated the total coverage to be around 10 percent, more recent studies nd the coverage to be signi cantly higher. This results in a wide range for total coverage of between 10 and 20 percent. The discrepancy in this particular estimate illustrates the lack of reliable data and, therefore, the dif culty of making precise estimates.52 | Healthy Partnershipsof a public system. Notwithstanding the dif - culty of implementing such a system, there was a consensus across the region that health insur-ance coverage levels would increase substan-tially over the next ve years. This would also bene t private providers who can participate in the system. The introduction and expansion of health insurance, when successful, has been found to be a game changer in many countries that have gone down this path. This is especially true when the program includes premium subsidies to allow the poor to be part of the program and when accompanied by changes in the providers that are eligible for reimbursement and in the payment system used to reimburse them. In Ghana and Nigeria, introduction of premium subsidies for the poor under their current health insurance system led to a signi cant increase in utilization of health services among poor peo-ple. In Nigeria, people who are covered through their health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have more choice among the health care provid-ers from which they can seek care. Provider behavior changes signi cantly when the reim- bursement system shifts from fee-for-service to case mix or capitation payments, as was seen, for example, in Hungary and other East Euro-pean countries. Similar changes were also seen among providers after Ghana shifted from fee-for-service to case mix reimbursements.Private Sector Participation in Public Schemes\u2014The Evidence from Tanzania BOX 2.11 The Tanzanian national insurance author- ity accreditation has a built-in bias against the private health sector with pre-accreditation of public facilities. Despite this bias, consumers predominantly choose the private health sector to provide their care. Seventy- ve percent of accredited facilities belong to the public sector, yet 75 percent of the reimbursements go to the 25 percent of facilities in the private sector. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. BOX 2.10 In the Democratic Republic of Congo, an incentive program that offers a reduction in the cost of infra- structure services is open to private companies but not to the private health sector. In addition, the incen- tives that would in theory be available to the private health sector are not applied equally to providers. Virtually all private sector respondents recalled how the government offered many incentives, including free ambulances, for the construction and operation of a high-pro le hospital owned by a famous expatriate Congolese citizen while ignoring clinics that have been serving communities for more than 20 years. Incentives for Some but not All in the Democratic Republic of Congo Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. private health insurance sectors. Private health insurance exists in the Democratic Republic of Congo mostly for people who can access treat-ment abroad. The issue of health insurance is high on the agenda across the region. Many countries are interested in introducing some form of public risk-pooling, and are looking at the systems in Ghana or Rwanda for inspiration. The introduc-tion of a public scheme is at an advanced stage in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. Other countries are actively considering the feasibility Healthy Partnerships | 53 Public provision of services The public provision of services domain focuses on how a government uses the direct production of health care inputs and health services to col-laborate with the private health sector. See gure 2.14 for description of good practice and sum-mary of results in public provision of services. Many countries score well in this domain. In addition to most of the high-performing countries mentioned in earlier domains, this category includes Angola, Cameroon, Mali, and Uganda. Good public-private collaboration: Speci c disease or vaccine programs The private sector participates widely in govern- ment disease and immunization programs across the region, marking one of the better areas of engagement. Private providers are included in these programs in 66 percent of countries. Donor programs such as the Global Fund are a big driver of such collaboration, and extensive programs for HIV and TB are present throughout Africa. Sig-ni cant, positive spillover effects emerge from this collaboration, especially in terms of increased dia-logue and information exchange. But more can be done. On a broader scale, public-private collabora-tion on disease-speci c programs can be a catalyst for further engagement. For example, Ethiopian respondents said the country's widely supported Public Private Mix\u2014for Directly Observed Treat-ment\u2014short course (PPM-Dots) program for tuberculosis, which involves the public and private sectors, was the starting point for further engage-ment that is now culminating in the development of a speci c private health sector policy. Once gov- ernments see the tangible bene ts of working with the private health sector, the motivation to extend the engagement to other areas increases. In Angola, private providers are included in the government-funded program on malaria. If patients choose private health providers, they may have to pay a nominal consulting fee for the physician's time; the drug itself is free of charge. Similarly, in Tanzania, the Ministry of Health approached the Association of Private Health Facilities to distribute anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) through their member clinics. By engag-ing the private sector, the Ministry was able to signi cantly increase the supply of ARVs in the country. The Tanzanian government has also extended such collaboration to small-scale drug shops, working with them as Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlets. The national rollout strat-egy offers training and accreditation to drug retailers in exchange for supplying quality drugs and participating in consumer awareness efforts. The program increases the availability of good drugs and helps to bring smaller drug shops into the formal sector through accreditation and training. A related form of engagement is supranational nancing to subsidize vital technologies with sig- ni cant externalities, taking advantage of the pri- vate health sector for disease-speci c interventions, for example. One prominent example of this is the Global Fund's Affordable Medicine Facility for malaria (AMFm), discussed in box 2.12. Referral systems in place but not always smooth The referral process between the public and pri- vate sectors can also be an area of collaboration in every country. The most common type of referral FIGURE 2.14 Good Practice and Results in Public Provision of Services Good practice in this domain is to have the following two elements in place: \u0081 The government takes advantage of the private health sector for public health programs (distribution of vaccines or medicines for public health programs through private sector facilities used as a proxy). \u0081 The public and private facilities work together when necessary (existence of a referral process between the public and private sector used as a proxy). Our research revealed the following: \u0081 There is good public-private collaboration for disease and immunization programs. \u0081 There is some form of a referral system in all countries. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.54 | Healthy Partnershipsis a patient moving from a small private facility to a larger public one for more advanced treatment. The process is more systematic in some countries than others. In Ethiopia, for example, private pro-viders ll out a referral form that the patient can take to the public hospital to ensure some level of continuity of care. Many patients are also referred from the public sector to the private, although the traf c is generally less in this direction. Countries with private providers able to offer highly advanced treatment often receive patients from the pub-lic sector. In Botswana, the Gaborone private hospital receives cancer patients from Prince Marina public hospital who require radiother-apy. This type of practice is fairly common across the region (table 2.10). Referrals can also be an alternative to sending public sector patients abroad for treatment (table 2.11). In Malawi, the Mwaiwathu Hospi- tal regularly receives patients from the Queen Elizabeth public hospital, including referrals for serious cases or for government of cials, who might otherwise have been treated abroad. Since the services are less expensive domesti-cally than abroad, the government saves money. This is not a common practice throughout the region, however, and some private sector respon-dents said governments preferred sending high-pro le patients abroad rather than treating them in-country. Governments can also use the referral pro- cess to bring informal providers into the system. In Guinea-Bissau, the Ministry of Health worked with matronas (traditional birth attendants), offering them formal training to improve the quality of deliveries and mitigate the risk of complications. A key part of the training was to BOX 2.12 Recognizing that most people in poor coun- tries are treated for malaria in the private sector, in 2005 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) called for new funds to subsidize coformulated artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs) for the entire global market to achieve end-user prices in the range of US$0.20 to US$0.50 per course of treatment, the current cost of chloro-quine. This recommendation describes a global subsidy that enters the system high in the drug distribution chain, meaning that highly subsi-dized drugs would be available to all high-level purchasers, both public and private sector. In this way, drugs would enter the existing public sector and private commercial channels much as any other drug, including chloroquine. In May 2010, the rst purchase orders for ACTs subsidized under Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm) were authorized. The high level of indirect subsidy is a rst. It is indirect because the manufacturer receives the subsidy; an importer, wholesaler, retailer, or consumer simply sees a less-expensive product traveling through the supply chain system, as would any other drug. There remains uncertainty regarding the impact of AMFm. Early results from Ghana and Kenya suggest, however, that retail prices have indeed dropped dramatically for ACTs. Retail prices in Accra were about US$0.70 per adult treatment, which is sharply lower than the pre-AMFm retail prices of up to US$9.00. In Kenya, some outlets sold the ACTs for about US$0.60, which is also considerably less than the pre-AMFm average price of US$6.00.

Healthy Partnerships | 55 help matronas identify dif cult cases and refer pregnant women to formal public or private clinics. Referral processes can of course be improved. Both public and private respondents complained about inef ciencies. Information is not always shared when a referral is made, so patients may have to start treatment again in the public sector or undergo tests they have already paid for in the private sector. In some cases, there is a strong bias against people coming from the private sector. Private sector respondents in Mali described patients who arrive at a public hospital in their ambulances only to be refused treatment. In the Seychelles, a patient referred from the private sector must pay to access the public sector. There is no charge if coming from another public sector facility. The referral process is also susceptible to manipulation by doctors who work in both the public and private sectors. Public sector respon-dents in many countries complained of self-referrals\u2014the tendency of doctors who work in both sectors to refer public patients to their pri-vate clinic instead of continuing treatment in the public sector. Although this can speed up treatment for the patient, the cost is usually much greater. A different type of engagement: How governments partner with faith-based organizations across the region xiii As noted, government engagement with FBOs is more extensive than with other private players across all domains and for all countries. xiv This close collaboration is partly explained by the per-ception among policy makers that the public sec-tor and FBOs share similar social goals and are committed to public health goals. Research also shows that some FBOs have intrinsic motivation to serve poor people. 101 Faith-based facilities in many countries predate public health care deliv-ery, especially in rural areas, and FBOs sometimes charge less than other private providers. Faith-based associations of providers also tend to be well organized and have a leadership structure that provides policy makers with a clear point of contact. Notwithstanding the relatively high levels of integration between the FBOs and the govern-ment, the engagement is not without consider-able challenges. Lack of resources in the public sector often spill over to FBO facilities and cause nancing shortfalls or duplication of over- sight and information systems. High levels of engagement, in practice, are fueled by the full or partial public nancing of TABLE 2.10 Intramural Private Practice in Public Facilities Namibia Private doctors are allowed to use public facilities to see private patients in exchange for time dedicated to treating public sector patients for free. Zambia Prince Marina public hospital has invited private doctors to commit some hours each week to public sector work.

Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. xiii. As was noted earlier, the majority of nonpro t providers are FBOs. This section focuses on FBOs, though the discussion and the higher levels of engagement are largely applicable to secular non-pro t organizations. Prominent examples of this, for example for Liberia or in the domain of nancing, are noted below. xiv. There are no faith-based facilities in the Seychelles.56 | Healthy PartnershipsFBO facilities, which occurs in 75 percent of countries. This usually goes beyond providing public funds to one facility for a particular ser-vice, as is often the case with individual for-pro t or self- nancing providers. Rather, the public sector will provide nancing for the entire network of FBO facilities. Although they often continue to be managed by staff in the faith-based group, such facilities are treated as an extension of the public sector and are consid-ered as such by the general population. This, as box 2.13 shows, changes the nature of engage-ment. Faith-based facilities are integrated into the public sector as a matter of course\u2014for example, larger facilities often act as reference hospitals for the public sector. Many of the indicators in the assessment framework are included in the contract or agree-ment with the faith-based providers, as exam-ples from across the domains show. Even when there is no agreement in place, engagement with FBOs is consistently higher because of the per-ceived alignment of social goals. Policy and dialogue In many countries, contracts or agreements are essentially policy frameworks for FBOs. They pro-vide the foundation for engaging in practice by comprehensively setting out the roles and respon-sibilities of private sector providers. The imple-mentation of such agreements requires close coordination between the Ministry of Health and the FBO, illuminating the intensity of engagement, as in the Lesotho example. Frequent meetings occur in most countries to coordinate activities and monitor performance of the contract. Information exchange Where FBOs are closely integrated into the public-provision network, faith-based facilities are typically fully included in the national health management information system. Providing information is gen-erally required as part of any agreement. The same is true for their involvement in the national dis-ease surveillance program. Often, FBO providers follow the same process as public sector facilities in providing information to the Ministry of Health. In some countries, the FBOs are responsible for collecting the information and sending it on. For example, in certain Democratic Republic of Congo health zones, public sector health centers send health-related information to a higher-level, faith-based facility. Regulation In many countries, the FBO umbrella organiza-tion has a comprehensive registry of all the facili-ties under its jurisdiction. Often, the umbrella organization will also have its own inspection regime for its facilities, and the government will defer to it to ensure quality control. For example, in Uganda the Catholic Medical Bureau's own group of inspectors reviews their facilities twice a year. They keep records of their visits and pass on all relevant information to the Ministry of Health representative at the district level. Generally, pub-lic inspectors do not visit facilities already cleared by the umbrella organization. In Liberia, where secular nonpro t organizations provide a large share of health care in the country, it is the umbrella bodies for nonpro t providers that are responsible for managing entire health zones, and the inspection process is left entirely to them. Financing Public money fl ows to the FBOs in many ways, beyond the contracts and service agreements. In many countries, some form of budget support is available to subsidize the operations of FBO opera-tors. This can be through direct nancial support, although in many countries it takes the form of human resources, as in Zimbabwe, where the gov-ernment provides nurses to small nonpro t health centers. A similar situation occurs in Rwanda, where the government provides community health workers and attaches them to small nonpro t health outposts in rural areas. In addition, FBO pro-viders are often able to bene t from nancial incen- tives, such as reduced rates of tax or exemptions from customs duties on equipment and medicines. Public provision of services Many of the agreements reviewed for this Report call on the government to provide vaccines or Healthy Partnerships | 57 other medicines to the nonpro t sector. In terms of the referral process, many of the secondary or tertiary faith-based facilities act as public refer-ence hospitals and so are an essential part of the national referral system. In Rwanda, two of the ve public reference hospitals in Kigali are non- pro t facilities that have long-standing agree- ments with the Ministry of Health. Increased engagement does not come without challenges or problems Getting engagement right is a constant process, including with respect to the relatively close col-laboration between faith-based providers and the public sector. Public nancing, for example, does not always arrive promptly. In Lesotho, the Chris-tian Health Association of Lesotho said payments BOX 2.13 The Christian Health Association of Lesotho (CHAL) pro- vides 40 percent of health care in the country. In 2007, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between the government of Lesotho and CHAL that pro-vided public funding for 80 percent of CHAL's budget in return for standardizing quality of health services and abid-ing by the same rules as all public facilities. CHAL retains management control of hospitals and clinics. The MOU integrates the faith-based group fully into the public system. The Joint Commission for Coopera-tion, consisting of Ministry of Health and CHAL of cials, acts as the of cial coordinating mechanism for the agree- ment. Monthly meetings are held to evaluate perfor-mance and raise issues of joint concern. CHAL facilities must submit HMIS data monthly and are fully involved in the disease surveillance program. Information is exchanged just as it would be with any public facility.Although the regulatory framework is outdated, CHAL abides by the same rules as public sector facilities. There is a Ministry of Health (MOH) accreditation process for all their CHAL hospitals and clinics. If they do not perform well, the government can remove funding for a speci c facility. CHAL of cials form part of joint inspection teams that regularly conduct oversight of all public and faith-based facilities in a health district. A key part of the MOU stipulates that CHAL must charge the same price for services as public sector facilities. CHAL must also bring salaries in line with the public sector. The government also supplies CHAL with drugs and vaccines as part of national programs. The difference in engagement between the government and a CHAL facility, on the one hand, and the government and a purely for-pro t provider, on the other, illustrates the special treatment that is accorded faith-based providers. The differ-ences in Lesotho mirror the differences elsewhere in Africa.The Christian Health Association of Lesotho TABLE B2.13 CHAL Facility Requirements Compared to those of Self-Financing Providers Domain CHAL facility Self- nancing providers Policy and dialogue \u0081 MOU as policy \u0081 No explicit policy \u0081 No dialogue mechanism Information exchange \u0081 Requirement to submit data \u0081 No requirement to submit data \u0081 100% compliance rates \u0081 Very few private providers submitting data voluntarily \u0081 Full involvement in disease surveillance program \u0081 Not involved in disease surveillance program Regulation \u0081 CHAL facilities following public sector regulation, \u0081 Outdated and inappropriate regulatory framework which is outdated \u0081 Regulated to charge same price as public facilities Financing \u0081 Government provision of 80% of CHAL's funding \u0081 Contracts with some individual private \u0081 No explicit incentives practitioners for specialized services \u0081 No explicit incentives available Public provision of \u0081 Strong involvement in disease programs \u0081 Strong involvement in disease programs services \u0081 Act as public sector reference facilities \u0081 Referral system functioning but weak Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.Information exchang e \u0081 Requirement to data \u0081 No requirement to submit data \u0081 100% compliance rates \u0081 Very few private providers submitting data voluntarily \u0081 Full involvement in disease surveillance pro gram \u0081 Not involved in disease surveillance pro gram Financ ing \u0081 Government provision o f 80% o f CHAL's fundin g \u0081 Contracts with some individual privat e \u0081 No explicit incentives practitioners for specialized services \u0081 No explicit incentives available 58 | Healthy Partnershipsfrom the Ministry of Health routinely arrive late, affecting its ability to provide uninterrupted ser-vices. Similar concerns were also raised about drugs and other commodities. In addition, the administrative burden increased, not just for HMIS data but in terms of general nancial reporting and other requirements imposed by the government. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the manager of one midsize FBO hospital said all of her time is spent dealing with the paper-work required for the contract; she hired extra staff just for this purpose. In Lesotho, Zambia, and elsewhere, some respondents said quality of care has actually fallen in faith-based facilities since public funding began. Engagement in low-resource environment When the government has very few resources, which is the case in many African countries, the prioritization of its activities or responsibilities toward the private health sector becomes espe-cially important. In terms of setting priorities for reform, post- confl ict countries face particularly tight con- straints. They are often faced with the question: If the ministry of health has the capacity to do only one or two things, what should they be? Letting associations and umbrella organizations carry out some of the activities that our frame-work identi ed as good practice can be a rela- tively effective approach, even where such examples of self-regulation are not initiated by the government. In the midst of confl ict, large and fragmented private health sectors arise when the government cannot continue to pro-vide essential health services. Such private pro-viders are often individuals running their own practices and various types of nonpro ts. The individual practices could be owned by skilled professionals or by unquali ed people who would otherwise not be in business, leading to a particularly wide range of providers. Especially in the aftermath of war, government capacity and oversight mechanisms take a long time to develop. Thus, the existing organizations either continue to provide services in different areas or Healthy Partnerships | 59 they coordinate themselves to ful ll what may traditionally be seen as the oversight by the ministry of health. In Liberia, the private providers came together to form an association that performs self-regulatory functions. The Private Clinics Association of Liberia was established by physi-cian assistants, certi ed midwives, and registered nurses. To combat the high degree of informal-ity that characterized their ranks, they began a process of self-regulation to complement the activities of the underresourced Liberian Medi-cal Board. With permission from the Medical Board, which has the mandate for registering all private clinics, the Private Clinics Association performs the initial inspection to ensure that the professionals are duly licensed and that the facilities are worthy of certi cation. They also perform inspections before facilities can have their licenses renewed by the Medical Board. The Private Clinics Association is able to reach areas the Medical Board would otherwise not have been able to inspect, and they have the mandate to close facilities that are not run by appropriately licensed professionals, thus main-taining quality within their professional ranks. In a more deliberate initiative, the govern- ment of Liberia runs a system where nongovern-mental organization (NGOs) are given contracts to run the county health systems. The NGOs currently work with the various county health departments to develop their stewardship capacity. At an even earlier stage of its develop-ment is South Sudan, as box 2.14 illustrates. Level of organization of the private health sector matters One of the key ingredients for successful public- private collaboration is the organization of the private sector. As discussed earlier, both public and private respondents called lack of organiza-tion one of the biggest barriers to further engage-ment. Even measured at a very basic level of organization, the private sector is organized in only 40 percent of countries in the region. In the rest, there is either no organization or it is dor-mant ( gure 2.15). Some countries have an umbrella organiza- tion covering the entire private sector, while others have one or more organizations repre-senting different areas of private health provi-sion. Umbrella organizations for the entire private sector exist in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. The group in Kenya, which was only recently formed, played a role in the development of the government's health care nancing strategy. BOX 2.14 The historic peace agreement between the govern- ment of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in 2005 created the semiautonomous South Sudan. In view of the independence referendum in 2011, the \"Healthy Partnerships\" interview team visited Juba in March 2010, even though it was not yet a sepa-rate country. The current assessment is about the state of government engagement in Sudan as a whole, using Khartoum state as a proxy where the federal system necessitates it. Since South Sudan is emerging from decades of civil war, and most infrastructure was destroyed during that period, it is no surprise that the health system is still in its nascent stages. The government of South Sudan is heavily reliant on donors for both funding of the Ministry of Health and for health service delivery. Over 80 percent of all health services are delivered by nongovernmental organizations that are connected with the state. There is also a small but growing self- nancing or for-pro t health sector, concen- trated in Juba. In any case, the Ministry of Health appears open to the private sector and recognizes that it is going to be a vital partner in the coming years. The Example of South Sudan Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.60 | Healthy PartnershipsIn many countries, poor organization of the private health sector creates a challenge for pol-icy makers who are willing to engage beyond individual contracts or have relationships with more than just high-pro le providers. In Angola, private providers were excluded from discus-sions about new health regulations because they did not have an industry association. By con-trast, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's well-organized Private Medical Practitioners Association and its Trade Union of Private Medical Practitioners con-vinced the Ministry of Health to include their input in the National Health Sector Strategic Plan for 2009-13. In a few cases, as in Lesotho, countries can suffer from too many industry associations, leaving the Ministry of Health unsure of whom to work with. Table 2.12 pro-vides evidence of how private sector organiza-tions have positively infl uenced public-private collaboration.Not surprisingly, the level of private health sector organization is highly correlated with the level of policy and dialogue; the better the orga-nization, the better the dialogue. While this may be unsurprising, good levels of private sector organization can also have bene ts for other domains; there are many examples where good private health sector organization has played a key role in encouraging public-private collabo-ration. Box 2.15 provides speci c examples. In a more general sense, private health sector organi-zations can exercise some self-regulation and therefore lessen the burden on the public sector to do everything. TABLE 2.12 How Private Sector Organizations Have Positively Infl uenced Public-Private Collaboration Republic of Congo The Pharmacists Association has successfully lobbied to be included in selling ARVs at a reasonable cost. Tanzania The Association of Private Health Facilities of Tanzania was engaged by the government to distribute vaccines and other goods from public health programs to private providers who make them available to patients.

Healthy Partnerships | 61 BOX 2.15 To shed light on the question of whether trade associa- tions are an effective conduit for engaging with the private sector, we report data from a survey of private health care providers in Ghana and Kenya that examines (a) the popularity of trade associations in the private health sector, and (b) to what extent trade associations engage with the government. The data in gure B2.15a show that the vast majority of private providers in Ghana\u2014nearly 80 percent\u2014are members of trade associations. The picture for Kenya is dramatically different: less than 20 percent of private pro-viders report trade association membership. Interestingly, the data also show that in both Ghana and Kenya, trade association membership does not vary much by type of facility. This suggests that trade associations might be an equally effective conduit for communicating with differ-ent types of providers, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Figure B2.15b shows the extent to which trade associa- tions help their members communicate with the govern-ment and register with statutory authorities. Roughly three quarters of providers in Ghana and Kenya say trade associa-tions act as a communication intermediary between facili-ties and the government, with a slightly higher fraction of Ghana's facilities reporting this type of support. By contrast, only 25 percent of Ghanaian providers say they received help with registration. A larger percentage of Kenyan facili-ties received this kind of assistance from their association. Overall, the data suggest that trade associations can provide a diverse range of private providers with a common voice. However, both trade association membership and the role associations play can vary signi cantly across coun- tries. In at least some countries, such as Ghana, engaging with trade associations may be an important and ef cient way for governments to work with the private sector.

There is a general positive trend toward improved coordination between the public and the private health sectors across the continent. What is needed is the support of all stakeholders to accelerate this process and to approach public-private engagement in a systematic manner. How does the assessment across domains help in prioritizing reforms going forward? As an illustrative example, we look at Rwanda. As described in Section 2, Rwanda per-forms relatively well across all ve domains; it has the highest scores, on average, for a low-income country. This nding is not unexpected and is supported by previous studies of the health sector in Rwanda 102 and by recent reports on documented improvements in the business environment. 103 Based on these external studies, and in line with the results from our assessment, the government of Rwanda seems to have done well in engaging with the private health sector ( gure 3.1). Despite the good scores, however, there are still many remaining challenges in Rwanda that the framework helps to highlight. The good practice elements identi ed per domain can be used as a checklist to identify these gaps. They include needed improvements of the regulatory framework, including a mechanism for regular inspection of all facilities, and insuf cient atten- tion to the continued education of private med-ical professionals. Integration of all private providers into the national health management information system is also urgently needed. These are the priorities for reform. They are also the priorities identi ed by stakeholders in Rwanda. It is encouraging that, thanks to strong political commitment to public-private collabo-ration, policy makers in Rwanda have begun to address exactly these issues. The key recommendations from this study are provided in the following sections. Ideas on how the ndings can be used to inform policy reform are offered rst. Then, we put the assess- ment framework in the context of health systems components. We offer conclusions along the ve domains and propose key actions for different stakeholder groups to strengthen public-private engagement in Africa. We end with an action plan for the research agenda following from this Report.The central argument of this Report is that public-private engagement can play a positive role in enhancing the ef cient use of scarce resources for health and can improve access to quality care in Sub-Saharan Africa. As Section 1 noted, improvements in health systems are urgent and cannot be left to the public sector alone. The private health sector is already making signi cant contributions to health systems in Africa. Therefore, improvements in the ef ciency of these systems and their overall performance need to include the private sec- tor. But not all government intervention or engagement with the private health sector is good. How should governments approach this challenge?64 | Healthy Partnerships FIGURE 3.1 Detailed Domain Scores: Rwanda ExampleReforms as a political process at the country level After years of benign neglect, policy makers are increasingly open to working with the private health sector. The framework offered here pro-vides a useful starting point for the process. Not-withstanding the conclusions that follow, however, it is important to keep in mind that reforms hap-pen in the context of a particular country and are subject to its political process. This Report offers a framework for policy mak- ers and stakeholders more generally to approach this critical issue. Instituting the necessary changes, however, is generally not a technical issue, but a political one. Therefore, the political process demands as much attention as the technical con-tents. Technically sophisticated solutions are use-less if they are not translated into changes in the national health system. To navigate the political process of reform, stakeholders can build on the cumulative experience of countries that have gone through this process, as the examples men-tioned earlier attest. Reforms can also build on the experience obtained through the \"Health in Africa\" initiative's ongoing support of the policy process in several African countries. 104 Translating technical solutions into realized changes also requires vigilance; governments and the private health sector must continue to work together throughout the policy cycle. The goal is to have the private sector fully embedded in the overall health system so that all providers, public and private, compete for funds from public and private sources by offering high-quality services. The establishment of appropriate structures and capacities to handle such a system takes time. All stakeholders\u2014governments, the private health sector, but also donor and third-party organizations\u2014will need to adjust. This is also true for faith-based providers who engage more closely with national governments, currently often through informal arrangements. In terms of prioritizing reforms, the political process also matters. Having manageable, con-crete elements to engage on improves the chances for sustained change, since successful reforms are the key ingredient to further successful reforms.

Engagement through health systems strengthening approach Since the health systems approach is now widely accepted as a logical way of strengthening sector performance, the recommendations can also be considered in the context of the health systems building blocks, as per the classi cation of the World Health Organization (WHO). Another compelling reason for using the health systems approach is that not all countries undertake sec-torwide reforms all the time. This is particularly true of donor-supported projects that tend to focus on speci c issues or systems. Adoption of this approach allows stakeholders to engage meaningfully in partial reforms. As a recent WHO report notes, To achieve their goals, all health systems have to carry out some basic functions, regardless of how they are organized: they have to provide services; develop health workers and other key resources; mobilize and allocate nances, and ensure health system leadership and governance (also known as stewardship, which is about oversight and guid-ance of the whole system). 105As seen in gure 3.2, there is considerable alignment between the domains of our frame-work and health systems building blocks. As men-tioned in the introduction to the Report, input markets are not the focus here, and so the ele-ments of \"health workforce\" and \"medical prod-ucts, and so forth\" are only partially addressed here. We expect to highlight the particular issues regarding public-private engagement in input markets in follow-on work. Key conclusions by domain The conclusions offered here, and the action plan below, relate to the entire private health sector, including faith-based organizations (FBOs) that are also looking for reforms. Indeed, the push for better engagement offers a good opportunity for FBOs to rede ne and develop their current work- ing relationship with governments. Improving engagement is about bringing all the relevant actors in a country's health system to the table to establish a more ef cient way of working together within the national priorities. Policy and dialogue Policy and dialogue between the government and the private health sector are the foundations of effective engagement. Our research shows that many countries have policies on paper but are lacking in implementation.

Note: PHS = private health sector.Close overlap Partially covered Some aspects covered66 | Healthy Partnerships\u0081 A meaningful dialogue between the private health sector and the government about mutual expectations and constraints sets the stage for follow-on actions by stakeholders. Setting up a formal process helps, but it is far more important to ensure that the dialogue takes place on an ongoing basis. \u0081 Implementation matters. Concrete steps are needed to show that the intention of engaging with the private health sector and with the government is real. A mechanism to monitor actual implementation, for example, by a third party, can build trust. \u0081 The organization of the private sector itself is critical in establishing a dialogue. The private health sector needs credible representation for the government to engage with. Information exchange \u0081 Existing information systems remain incom- plete if they do not include the private health sector. Having separate or designated informa-tion systems for the private health sector is nei-ther necessary nor more effective. \u0081 Excessive reporting requirements for the pri- vate sector are not useful. Requirements should be aligned with the following: - What the private health sector can reason- ably be expected to provide - What the public sector can reasonably use and give feedback on (that is, data that are collected but not processed, analyzed, or reported in a meaningful way create an undue burden on private providers) - National priorities. In all of these three points, dialogue with the private health sector is important. \u0081 Private providers can be incentivized to pro- vide data to the Ministry of Health, for exam-ple, through the inclusion in public health interventions. At a minimum, the motivation can involve the provision of feedback and results of analysis of data submitted.\u0081 Information disclosure and availability of infor- mation that allows patients to make informed choices is important for the entire health sys-tem. The tendency toward secrecy in the pri-vate sector is still too common. \u0081 Health facility surveys that include all facility types in the private health sector can provide a basic level of information for planners. Regulation \u0081 A complete and up-to-date registry of private health facilities is a basic precondition for effec-tive health system planning. Where such a reg-istry is not yet feasible in the medium term, alternatives are available for updating the infor-mation on \"who does what,\" such as the surveys mentioned above. It may not be necessary for the Ministry of Health to ful ll this function directly, because other umbrella organizations can play an important function here and subse-quently share their data with the ministry. \u0081 Overly complex frameworks that are contradic- tory or that cannot be put into practice as intended create uncertainty and opportunities for arbitrary enforcement. While a full-on over-haul will not be feasible in the near term, identi-fying and correcting the most urgent \"mistakes\" in the regulatory framework is. Therefore, review and revision of the regulatory framework is needed to ensure that: - It is appropriate for the country's health sys- tem, including the size and type of the pri-vate health sector. - It establishes a straightforward regime of licensing of professionals and of facilities that is appropriate and aligned to the coun-try's health care needs. Restrictions on com-petition, for example, through protection of current practitioners from foreign practitio-ners or investors, deserve particularly close scrutiny for relevance. - It is appropriately simple and aligned with enforcement capacity. At least part of the oversight functions can be ful lled by pri- vate organizations or associations; enforce- Healthy Partnerships | 67 ment capacity is to be understood in that broader sense. - It addresses issues of quality in some fash- ion through facility-based (inspections) or profession-based (continuing medical edu-cation [CME] requirements and offerings for all professionals) approaches. The recog-nition of voluntary approaches has been successfully used to incentivize quality improvements. For example, facilities can be awarded a certi cate or other recognition that can be displayed for patients or other visitors to see. \u0081 Self-regulation can substitute for enforcement by the government. In dialogue with private provider associations or third-party organiza-tions, the extent and type of authority can be determined. Financing The key to nancing is to ensure that there is a mechanism that allows poor people to have access to services, and that public funds buy value for money from either public or private services that compete on a level playing eld. The principle of strategic purchasing (buying services from the best providers regardless of ownership) is espe-cially important to consider in countries where the private sector is large. \u0081 The inclusion of the private health sector in public health programs including (partial) public funding for privately provided services can improve health systems performance. Where the private sector provides health ser-vices ef ciently and to the poor population, it can be a well-placed channel for publicly nanced care. \u0081 Taxation regimes that disadvantage the private health sector, including excessive import tariffs on inputs (pharmaceuticals, equipment, and so forth) are damaging to the health system over-all. Taxation and incentive issues can become highly technical, which calls again for dialogue on priority areas between government (for example, the tax authority) and the private health sector. Private health facilities may be classi ed as noncommercial enterprises for tax reasons if, for example, they are committed to also serving the poor and therefore provide partly public services. \u0081 The expansion of health insurance toward uni- versal coverage\u2014ongoing in several African countries\u2014has the potential to fundamentally change the dynamics in, and improve perfor-mance of, national health systems. Insurance, especially when appropriate focus is put on expanding coverage to the indigent, not only decreases the nancial risk of impoverishment from ill health. Higher levels of private pro-vider coverage through health insurance also offer a more easily predictable revenue stream for providers, which improves the business case for increased investment in the health sec-tor. In addition, the accreditation process required to receive insurance reimbursements has proven to generate powerful incentives for providers to focus on improving quality. The intermediation of the insurance system's accreditation process (or similar function) alle-viates capacity constraints in the government for enforcing regulations. \u0081 Using nancing as an instrument for engage- ment is dif cult, both technically and politi- cally. While the appetite for big changes (for example, insurance) is clearly present, small changes provide the opportunity to build tech-nical capacity and (political) trust in the con-cept. Starting to contract out for ancillary services at public hospitals, for example, if it has not been instituted yet, can provide experi-ence before launching major service delivery contracts. Public provision of services In areas where there are no viable markets or when there are large externalities, there is a need for the public sector to step in and ensure the availability of both basic services and institutional support. Like the private sector in general, the pri-vate health sector also depends on publicly nanced services such as water, electricity, and basic education.68 | Healthy Partnerships\u0081 Similar to the nancing domain, our research suggests that the inclusion of the private health sector in public health programs, including public provision or nancing of goods and ser- vices, can bene t health systems performance. Immunization programs, for example, will be less effective if the private health sector and their patients are excluded. \u0081 On a related note, the explicit inclusion of pri- vate providers in the health system maps of local governments (for example, municipal, county, district, or province) and associated referral channels will bene t the ef ciency of the whole health system, especially if it is accompanied by public-private dialogue to work out technical modalities. Recommended actions by group of stakeholders The following are guidelines for an action plan for each group of stakeholders: governments, the pri-vate health sector, donors, and intermediaries or third-party organizations. The action plans are summarized in gures 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6, respectively. Governments SHORT TERM \u0081 Stop interventions that are inadvertently harm- ful to the private health sector; keep the effects on the private health sector of all interventions in mind. Effective engagement with the private health sector is not always about doing more; sometimes the solution is to do less. Section 2 points to a number of government interven-tions that create massive distortions; they should be eliminated as soon as possible. \u0081 Establish a mechanism for ongoing dialogue with the private health sector to de ne com- mon priorities and strengthen partnerships. There is an urgent need for increased commu-nication in many countries. The good practice example of Ghana highlights the advantages of (re-)establishing a speci c public-private health sector dialogue.\u0081 Conduct a basic analysis of the private health sector, including the composition and capacity of private providers. This need not be a sophisti-cated, time-consuming, or expensive analysis. Establishing a basic level of information and understanding of the private health sector is crit-ical. Without it, policy makers will not be able to carry out their work in a strategic manner. \u0081 Start with manageable, concrete changes; suc- cess builds on success. Technical and political hurdles, for example, in using nancing as an instrument, can be tackled by building trust in the engagement process itself. LONG TERM \u0081 Formulate a policy for engagement if one does not exist, or revive and revise the existing pol-icy if there is one; the policy should focus on what is feasible and most desirable to be imple-mented. \u0081 Use the full range of instruments, across all ve domains, to engage with the private health sec-tor. The framework presented here includes the basic elements and provides a useful guide to engagement. It can also help identify the key areas of reform. Beyond these initial guidelines, it is imperative for governments to develop a more comprehensive reform agenda appropri-ate for the particular country context. \u0081 Simplify the regulatory framework. The key is to prioritize and align with the priorities identi- ed in dialogue with the private health sector. \u0081 Encourage the private health sector and third- party organizations to take an active role in addressing the issue of quality of care. If respon-sibilities and authorities are clearly de ned, self-regulation or similar mechanisms may be effective in promoting quality while avoiding unnecessary burdens on private providers. \u0081 Ensure that health professionals have access to CME courses offered by public or private insti-tutions. In particular, professionals from the private sector should have similar access to such courses as their colleagues from the pub-lic sector. Healthy Partnerships | 69 \u0081 Establish or revive a basic oversight function for the private health sector, including moni-toring and evaluating the impact of govern-ment policies on it. Ideally, a focal point should exist within the Ministry of Health that deals solely with the private health sector. \u0081 Establish an up-to-date and comprehensive registry of private sector providers in the health system. This is a central element of good engagement. Encouraging informal providers to at least undertake basic registration is crucial if governments are to accurately map the scale and scope of who is doing what in their health system. Registration will be effective only if it is simple, cheap, and fast. \u0081 Develop the capacity for strategic nancing and contracting of services to the private health sector. This can be used to ll the access gaps that exist in speci c health services within regions or population groups. It may also include preventive care, which the private sec-tor often does little of, since most of the reve-nue comes from out-of-pocket payments. Private health sector \u0081 Form a representative body to participate in the engagement process. While there is some evi-dence of private health sector organization across the region, it is insuf cient in most coun- tries. Where more than one organization of the same facility type exists, the private sector should consider merging or forming an umbrella organization that gives the public sector a single focal point for interaction. The representative body's role will also be to effectively communi-cate the contributions that private providers are making to national health goals. \u0081 Seek meaningful dialogue as a rst step in improving public-private engagement. The previous section showed how private sector initiative has driven the engagement process in some countries. \u0081 Collaborate with the government to address the issue of quality of care. Provider networks, capacity building in clinical practice (through CME), and business management training are all ways that private groups can help improve the care offered by their members. \u0081 Offer credible solutions to shift some oversight responsibility from the government to the rep-resentative body. While the government remains the steward of the health system, effective self-regulation can improve the sector overall and ease the capacity constraints of the government. \u0081 Strengthen internal quality control and business management processes at private facilities. Espe-cially in terms of business management prac-tices, most private providers have a lot to catch up to. Associations of private providers have a FIGURE 3.3 Summarized Action Plan for Governments \u0081 Establish or strengthen ongoing dialogue with private health sector. \u0081 Formulate or re ne policy of engagement. \u0081 Know at a basic level what the private health sector does. \u0081 Simplify regulatory framework to match enforceable standards. \u0081 Challenge private sector organizations to take on some oversight responsibilities. \u0081 Level the playing eld between public and private providers. \u0081 Start with small, concrete steps to develop capacity when reforms are politically or technically dif cult.

Donors Donors can play an important role in supporting both the public and private sectors as they seek to improve engagement. \u0081 Include the private sector in bilateral discus- sions and design of projects; support the engagement process; take an active role in improving communication. \u0081 Provide funding for activities that are aligned with overall development goals. Funding for service delivery should be appropriately bal-anced to enhance the relative advantages of both the private and public sectors. The main driver should be national health priorities. \u0081 Ensure that donor harmonization processes do not cling to preconceived ideas about the rela-tive merits of public compared to private ser-vice delivery. \u0081 Improve the predictability of donor funding and increase the duration of commitments. This will support long-term planning. It will also help prevent long-term losses, for example, through temporary elimination of domestic markets for health care goods or services being created out of short-term gains. \u0081 Ensure that donor funding does not do more harm than good; for example, donor efforts on malaria control that have supported the provi-sion of high-quality drugs at highly subsidized prices can negatively affect local manufactur-ing of generic drugs (which may have a better chance of longer-term sustainability for the countries involved). Third-party organizations Third-party organizations can be insurance author-ities, civil society organizations (for example, con-sumer advocacy groups), and others. \u0081 Support and urge the increased organization of the private health sector. \u0081 Provide training and support to private provid- ers who need it, including on the management or business aspects of their work. \u0081 Support the ability of patients to make inform- ed choices.

Healthy Partnerships | 71 Action plan for future research In addition to the action plan suggested for all stakeholders, we consider the action plan for tak-ing this work forward: what is the follow-up in terms of analytical work from this report? The fol-lowing elements are under consideration on the analytical side (see gure 3.7 for a summary). \u0081 Replication. The work presented here consti- tutes an important rst step toward assessing the policy environment of the private health sector and how engagement is shaping the environment. We expect that in future work, the relative levels and types of engagement can be assessed again to measure and discuss the progress made and the relative effectiveness of various reforms. It will be important that future iterations build on the work done here while re ning and further developing the framework and the individual indicators. \u0081 Estimating impact. The link between engage- ment and intermediate outcomes (access, qual-ity, equity) or health outcomes (for example, maternal or child mortality) can start to be examined, based on the developed indicators. As the measures of engagement are re ned, such analyses can improve our understanding of what type of engagement achieves the best results.\u0081 Thematic expansion. Three points are among the agenda items for future (and currently ongoing) research. - The report focused on service delivery. Addi- tional analytical work is underway to further highlight the role of the private sector in input markets (for example, manufacturing, importing, and distributing and retailing pharmaceuticals and medical equipment). The private sector also has a major role to play in the education of the health work-force. The framework for assessing engage-ment can contribute to the discussions in this area, as well. - Africa is becoming a destination for foreign investors in the health care market. While this Report has not focused on the foreign direct investment dimension, such consider-ations will be increasingly on the agenda for policy makers. Several countries in the region have already devoted signi cant efforts to attracting investors, for both nal service delivery and input markets. - Subregional dimension: This report has only discussed the national level. Policy makers in Africa are exploring the potential of sub-regional coordination. This exists on the business side with the West African Organ-isation pour l'Harmonisation en Afrique du FIGURE 3.7 Summarized Action Plan for Future Research \u0081 Replicate assessment to measure progress. \u0081 Further develop framework/indicators.\u0081 Estimate impact of engagement on outcomes.\u0081 Expand assessment thematically to include (a) private sector role in input markets and health worker education, (b) foreign investment in the health sector, (c) sub-regional dimension. \u0081 Expand geographically to apply framework to developing health systems in other regions. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.72 | Healthy PartnershipsDroit des Affaires (OHADA). The move toward similar frameworks for the private health sector holds great promise to lever-age scarce oversight capacity. \u0081 Future rounds of this work may address how the framework and the indicators developed here are applicable to developing countries in other regions. Toolkit for further guidance A toolkit is available online to provide further guidance to stakeholders interested in improving the public-private engagement in health. See www.wbginvestmentclimate.org/health.In conjunction with the other available resources and with the expertise at the country level, this Report should be used as an advocacy tool in the reform process. The framework devel-oped here and used to assess engagement across Sub-Saharan Africa provides a starting point for developing a country-speci c reform agenda, and better engagement can lead to reforms in the health sector more broadly. Even though the challenges are enormous and improvements in African health systems are urgent, the willingness\u2014and even demand\u2014to look at health systems in a new way is reason to hope. When public and private sectors work in partnership, improved access to affordable, high-quality care is achievable in Africa.

Collec-tively, the indicators provide a snapshot of the operating environment for the private health sec-tor. Along with the new data on engagement dis-cussed throughout the report, the operating environment is shown from the private sector side (also affecting nonhealth private rms) and from the health side (also affecting public health provid-ers). In order to complete the logical framework, further discussed in appendix 4, intermediate and ultimate outcomes are included as well. Many of the indicators are proxy or tracer indica- tors. They are not meant to fully capture the theme for which they are chosen. Instead, they represent the best existing standardized data for cross-country assessment. The fact that the indicators are imper-fect proxies illustrates the dearth of reliable data in general. For example, robust data for fundamental vital registration indicators (births and deaths, including cause of death) barely exist in many coun-tries in Sub-Saharan Africa. 106 Policy makers face the daunting task, therefore, of improving health systems often despite lacking basic information, such as who has died from what. Improving the availability of data for decision making is critical, as is making the best use of existing data. While com-prehensive and reliable information is scarce, the snapshots and the data in Appendix 2 constitute a big improvement over what has been available so far for assessing the contributions of the private health sector and its operating environment. The following explains the sections included in each snapshot. Table A1.1 at the end of the country snapshots provides further details on the indicators used in the snapshots that are derived from third-party sources.APPENDIX 1 \u2014Country snapshots 1. The banner The banner provides basic information on the country and its high-level health outcomes. Total population and income per capita (as de ned by the World Development Indicators) provide an indication of the (potential) size of the health market. Life expectancy and the measures for Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4, 5, and 6 are displayed to refl ect the high-level health outcomes of the population. The MDGs are also the most prominent goals in terms of population health. Note that the standard indicator for MDG 6 refl ecting diagnoses of the communicable diseases HIV, TB, and malaria has been transformed into percentage terms. Data sources: World Development Indicators (WDI), 2010 (note that the data quoted in the WDI may in fact be a few years older than the WDI year); United Nations Statistics Division for noti ed cases of malaria. 107 2. Engagement The engagement data are the newly collected data discussed in detail in the Report. The normalized scores for each domain in a given country are presented in the pentagon spider gure for a representation of relative strengths and weaknesses of domains in a given country. Averages across the Sub-Saharan Africa countries are also represented in the pentagon graph (indicated by the blue line) for a comparison. It should be noted that the Sub-Saharan Africa average is calculated in this table and in subsequent tables for the 45 countries covered by the research, in each instance across all countries for which data is available.

Intermediate outcomes: Access and quality For countries where data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) are available, the snapshots provide measures of access and quality as the intermediate outcomes. The measures chosen for the snapshot are, again, only proxies. Appendix 2 provides a more comprehensive set of measures for intermediate outcomes. Access to health care is measured in terms of self-reported source of care for children with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI). To proxy for the quality of care that is available in a country, the snapshots show the percentage of women who received all ve of the basic prenatal services at some point during their pregnancy (blood pressure checks, blood tests, urine tests, weight check, and discussion of complications). Data on percentage of births that are attended by a skilled health staff (WDI data) are shown as an additional proxy for quality of available health services. For countries where DHS data are not available, the snapshots report immunization coverage rates for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) and measles as an imperfect proxy for the DHS access measures. Note that averages for DHS data include only the 27 countries for which the relevant data are available. Data sources: World Development Indicators, 2010; Demographic and Health Surveys, year varies by country (see Table A1-1).4. Health expenditure Data on the type of expenditure by the typical consumer/patient provides more detail on the health market: how much is currently being spent on each person (per capita spending on health) and who is spending it (the relative share of private and public in total expenditure on health). The high average share, of private spending coming from out-of-pocket payments shows the extent to which especially the poor population is vulnerable to potential nancial impoverishment due to ill health. It is generally also an indication of the kind of funding that private providers have relied on most heavily. Data source: World Development Indicators, 2010. 5. Business environment Selected measures from the World Bank's Doing Business indicators illustrate how easy or dif cult it is to operate as a private company. Four measures that are most relevant to health providers are selected. Private health providers are typically required to register as private businesses, a process that can take considerable time and money. They also have to pay taxes and, occasionally, seek the enforcement of contracts. How easily these things are done for the private sector in general, therefore, affects private health providers as well. Data source: Doing Business 2011. 6. Supporting services Availability of basic services, such as water and electricity, signi cantly impact the cost of doing business for any private enterprise, especially private health providers. Measures of coverage for clean water and sanitation serve as proxies, in the absence of a similar measure for electricity. In addition, the availability of education has a signi cant impact on the customers of the private providers and, therefore, indirectly on private providers. As a proxy, we use female literacy, which is also strongly associated with positive health outcomes.

Indicator Year De nition Source Population (millions) 2009 Total population is based on the de facto de nition of population, which World Development Indicators, counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship, except for World Bankb refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum who are generally considered part of the population of their country of origin. The values shown are midyear estimates. GNI per capita, Atlas 2008 GNI (formerly GNP) is the sum of value added by all resident producers, World Development Indicators, method (current US$) plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of World Bank output, plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. Life expectancy (years) 2008 Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant World Development Indicators, would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were World Bank to stay the same throughout its life. Under-5 mortality rate 2009 Under-5 mortality rate is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn baby World Development Indicators, (per 1,000) will die before reaching age 5, if subject to current age-speci c mortality World Bank rates. Maternal mortality ratio 2008 Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die during World Development Indicators, (modeled estimate, per pregnancy and childbirth per 100,000 live births. The data are estimated World Bank100,000 live births) with a regression model using information on fertility, birth attendants, and HIV prevalence. Prevalence of HIV, total 2007 Prevalence of HIV refers to the percentage of people ages 15-49 who World Development Indicators, (% of population ages are infected with HIV. World Bank15-49) Incidence of tuberculosis 2008 Incidence of tuberculosis is the estimated number of new pulmonary, World Development Indicators, (% of population) smear positive, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases. The standard World Bank indicator is reported per 100,000 population, but is transformed into percentages for purposes of this report. Noti ed cases of malaria 2008 Malaria incidence is expressed as the number of new cases reported by Millennium Development Goal (% of population) a Ministry of Health, adjusted to take into account (a) incompleteness Indicators, United Nations in reporting systems; (b) patients seeking treatment in the private sector, Statistics Division self-medicating, or not seeking treatment at all; and (c) potential over- diagnosis through the lack of laboratory con rmation of cases. For some African countries, the quality of case reporting is considered insuf cient, and estimates are derived from longitudinal studies of malaria incidence recorded in the published literature, with adjustments for population distribution and public health programs. The standard indicator is reported per 100,000 population, but is transformed into percentages for purposes of this report. Health expenditure per 2007 Total health expenditure is the sum of public and private health World Development Indicators, capita (current US$) expenditures as a ratio of total population. It covers the provision of World Bank health services (preventive and curative), family planning activities, nutrition activities, and emergency aid designated for health, but it does not include provision of water and sanitation. Data are in current U.S. dollars. Public sector share of 2007 Public health expenditure consists of recurrent and capital spending from World Development Indicators, total health expenditure government (central and local) budgets, external borrowings and grants World Bank(percent) (including donations from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations), and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds. Private sector share of 2007 Private health expenditure includes direct household (out-of-pocket) World Development Indicators, total health expenditure spending, private insurance, charitable donations, and direct service World Bank(percent) payments by private corporations. Out-of-pocket health 2007 Out-of-pocket expenditure is any direct outlay by households, including World Development Indicators, expenditure (% of gratuities and in-kind payments, to health practitioners and suppliers of World Bankprivate expenditure pharmaceuticals, therapeutic appliances, and other goods and serviceson health) whose primary intent is to contribute to the restoration or enhancement of the health status of individuals or population groups. It is a part of private health expenditure. Time required to enforce 2010 Time required to enforce a contract is the number of calendar days from Doing Business 2011 a contract (days) the ling of the lawsuit in court until the nal determination and, in appropriate cases, payment. Indicators on enforcing contracts measure the ef ciency of the judicial system in resolving a commercial dispute. 122 | Healthy PartnershipsIndicator Year De nition Source Time required to 2010 Time it takes to prepare, le, and pay (or withhold) three major types of Doing Business 2011 prepare and pay taxes taxes\u2014the corporate income tax, the value-added or sales tax, and labor(hours per year) taxes, including payroll taxes and social security contributions.

The frame-work grew out of an extensive consultative devel-opment process of more than two years. Please refer to the background paper available at www. wbginvestmentclimate.org/health for a discussion of the development process itself, and of the alternative frameworks that were considered but ultimately discarded in favor of the one present-ed here. The starting point for both the Report and the framework is the understanding that the operat-ing environment is a constraint to greater contri-butions of the private health sector to health systems performance. This understanding grew out of the ndings of the earlier International Financial Corporation report, \"The Business of Health in Africa,\" and was con rmed by the increased attention of national governments and international partners to the operating environ- ment of the private health sector. 108 The fact that a constraint (the operating envi- ronment) to better contributions by the private health sector was identi ed matters, because if such contributions could be improved, health sys-tems performance would improve as well, which in turn would improve the ultimate outcomes (for example, people's health). This logical frame-work was discussed in the Report, but is consid-ered here in slightly more detail and is presented schematically in gure A3.1. This Report's focus on public-private engage- ment, therefore, is based on the understanding that it is through engagement that major elements of the inappropriate operating environment for private providers can be identi ed and improved. Such improvements in the operating environ-ment, in turn, will relieve one of the key con-straints to enhancing the contributions of the EngagementContributions by the private sectorOperating environment(Intermediate) outcomesInfl uencesFigure A3.1 Simpli ed Logic Model for Private Health Sector Contributions to Health Outcomes Infl uences and is part ofInfl uences132 | Healthy Partnershipsprivate health sector and to improving health sys- tems overall. This model is a crude simpli cation and adap- tation of the more comprehensive logical model that is typically used for the health sector, such as the one depicted in gure A3.2. The essence of it, however, is the same. Figure A3.2 is also a schematic representation of the underlying theory: engagement can impact health sector characteristics and, therefore, the private health sector's contribution to the health system overall. This, in turn, will impact those things we really care about\u2014health outcomes and protection from nancial risk. Setting the context\u2014Engagement as a part of stewardship Engagement with the private health sector is part of the broader concept of stewardship, or overall government responsibility for the health sector. The World Health Organization's World Health Report 2000 describes stewardship as involving oversight of \"the entire health system\" (p. 123), private as well as public. Key elements of this gov-ernment responsibility\u2014usually through a health ministry\u2014include strategic planning, regulating, monitoring and evaluating, and setting and enforc-ing the rules and incentives that de ne the envi- ronment and guide the behavior of health system players. This Report's focus on government engage- ment with the private health sector does not sug-gest that other stewardship functions are less important in reaching health targets. Rather, the focus on engagement is motivated by the fact that relatively little attention has been paid to how governments are engaging the private sector at the systems level. Given the poor performance of many health systems in Africa, and the large size Figure A3.2 Logic Model for Private Health Sector Contributions to Health Outcomes Source: Adapted from Watson, Broemeling, and Wong 2009.

The shifting stewardship role in Africa In recent years, the way in which governments have been carrying out their stewardship func-tions has been shifting signi cantly. As the capac- ity of nonstate oversight mechanisms within the private health delivery system grows, the mechan-ics of transactions between public and private sec-tors become institutionalized and the role of government increasingly emphasizes strategy and the ongoing review and adjustment of rules to ensure ef cient and fair functioning of the mar- ket, equitable distribution, and acceptable levels of quality. Two important trends are underway in different countries in the Africa region: The separation of stewardship functions such as policy and strategy from the management of publicly provided services The separation of stewardship functions from the nancing functions such as revenue genera- tion, risk pooling, and purchasing. In Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development countries, the experience has been an evolution from the direct provision of care to a more nuanced balance. In Africa, the same evolu-tion has also been happening, at different speeds in different countries. But the continental trend is unmistakable. Ghana provides the clearest exam-ple of this evolution: in 1997, the country created the Ghana Health Services (GHS), separating the provision of care (now under GHS) from the pol-icy functions of the Ministry of Health. In 2004, Ghana went further and separated the bulk of nancing and risk pooling from policy, creating the Ghana National Health Insurance Scheme and giving it a degree of autonomy from both gov-ernmental delivery, in the form of the GHS, and governmental policy, in the form of the Ministry of Health. Similar changes are occurring in other countries across Africa, such as Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Uganda.It is in this context of the evolving roles in the ministries, or in observations that their neighbor-ing country ministries are evolving, that policy makers are asking for support. A central challenge for them and, therefore, for this Report is that pri-vate health sector engagement requires not only the point of view of health and health systems, but also the point of view of private sector devel-opment and a careful consideration of the busi-ness environment. Building the analytic framework for engagement The project team set out to create a conceptual framework capable of measuring and enabling comparison of how governments are engaging the private health sector in each country. Engagement was de ned as the deliberate, systematic collabo- ration of the government and the private health sector according to national health priorities, beyond individual interventions and programs. The engagement framework is based on the clas-sic role of the state and the policy instruments that governments can use to infl uence the private health sector, as adapted by Harding and Preker (2003). Engagement, therefore, is broken down into ve domains, each of which is bidirectional to and from the private health sector, and each inter-acts with the others: Policy and dialogue Information exchange Regulation Financing Public provision of services. Each of the domains represents a key aspect of government engagement with the private health sector. Although it is not a speci c policy instru- ment, the policy and dialogue domain measures the underlying policy framework for, and dialogue with, the private health sector. The other domains cover the range of policy instruments that govern-ments can use to engage the private health sec-tor\u2014information exchange, regulation, nancing, and public provision of services.134 | Healthy PartnershipsDe ning the constructs to be measured The operating environment for private health providers is best understood as consisting of three interrelated elements: The health side, affecting all operators in the health sector The private sector side, to which all private companies in any sector are subject Elements of the operating environment that are unique to the private health sector, that is, speci c issues in the operating environment that affect private businesses engaging in health service delivery. Table A3.1 delineates areas speci c to the private health sector, and the more general areas from the private sector and health system perspectives. The dark green areas are the areas of focus for the framework, and those shaded in light green are secondary areas of focus, given their overall importance to public-private collaboration.What follows is a brief discussion of each of the domains. Background is provided for the key con-structs in each domain, as is an explanation of how they link to the measures discussed in Sec-tion 2 of the Report. Policy and Dialogue Policy and dialogue is the starting point for mea-suring government engagement with the private health sector; it underlines and summarizes gov-ernment intentions for the use of the other poli-cy instruments. Given the frequent mistrust and suspicion between the government and private providers in many countries, establishing an underlying policy framework for the private health sector can help lay the foundation for practical engagement by framing the intention for the relationship as one of collaboration rather than competition. The existence of a functioning dialogue mechanism with the private providers shows that the government is aware of their presence, takes them into account, and views Table A3.1 Domain Matrix for Indicator Development Private sector Private health sector Health Policy and dialogueOverall policy, inclusion, and attitude of government toward private sector Use of private providers for the delivery of public services in other sectors (education, infrastructure, water, etc.)Less applicable to private sector; information related to registration and accreditation under \"regulation\" Provision of basic services for private sector operations, such as electricity, water, educationRegulatory burden on private sector (e.g., ease of entry)Speci c information exchange for private health sector Public provision of services to crowd out private providers (e.g. due to perceived lack of quality)Applicability of general regulatory burden for private health service providersFull inclusion of the private sector in the information system Full inclusion of the private sector in the distribution of public goods (e.g., vaccina-tion programs)Regulatory framework speci c for private health sectorQuality of overall health information management system Coverage and quality of services provided through the public health systemEqual treatment in terms of quality restrictions, inspections, etc. Capacity of the government to exercise oversight role generally for the public sectorSpeci c policy and private health sector dialogue Public money fl owing to the private health sector for the delivery of servicesDegree of government ownership of its role as steward of the whole health system Government capacity in decentralized nancing and availability or strength of risk-pooling mechanismsInformation exchange Regulation Financing Public provision of services Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010. Primary areas of focus Secondary areas of focus Healthy Partnerships | 135 them as a partner to improve overall health sys- tems performance. Taken together, policy and dialogue presents the overall context for the pri-vate health sector across the region. In light of the fact that the government's stew- ardship role toward public and private health sec-tor providers can be signi cantly different, the domain focuses on policy and dialogue speci c to the private health sector. The key construct here, therefore, is nding out the intention and action of the government toward the private health sec-tor. The policy and dialogue domain captures both overall intentions toward, and current level of government engagement with, the private health sector by measuring two things: The existence of a private health sector policy framework and its implementation The presence of a dialogue mechanism between the government and the private health sector, as well as actual levels of dialogue. Information Exchange A key ingredient of engagement is the govern-ment having accurate information on the private health sector. In practical terms, this requires the development of an information exchange between the government and the private health sector so that important data about the scale and scope of private providers can be collected by the govern-ment and then used in a strategic manner to ensure private health care is used as ef ciently as possible to further overall health goals. Indeed, having more systematic information about health markets is a key rst step in any reform. This is especially pertinent if the private health sector is providing a large amount of care in a country, as it does in much of the Africa region. Unlike the other domains, however, informa- tion exchange is not something that needs to be done speci cally for the private health sector. The government, as the steward of the entire health system, needs to have basic information on all the health service facilities, regardless of whether they are public or private, for appropriate planning and action. Moreover, government must inform pri-vate practitioners and facilities of changing regula-tions, infectious disease outbreaks, new treatment protocols, and other information relevant to their operations or delivery of care. In such cases, the critical factor is not the creation of systems spe-ci c to the private health sector that parallel those in the public sector; rather, the critical factor is that the government is fully including the private health sector in the various information functions it has under its jurisdiction. The key construct for the information exchange domain, therefore, is whether the private health sector is included in the governments' informa-tion systems. This includes whether there is a fl ow of basic information between the government and private providers both in terms general informa-tion on the operating environment and for the health information management system. Private sector participation in national disease surveil-lance programs, a critical function of a Ministry of Health, is also measured. Information collection, dissemination, and management, with the full inclusion of the private providers, should be part of the government's overall strategy for the health sector as a key element of ensuring the outcomes intended. Regulation Most governments in the region view their role vis-\u00e0-vis the private health sector primarily as that of regulators. Thus, their penchant for turning to regulation\u2014setting rules to direct, prescribe, or otherwise infl uence the actions of private provid- ers\u2014to solve problems is often strong. The use of regulation, among other public interventions, is usually justi ed, in economic terms, by the intent to correct a market failure. Evidence from other country contexts suggests, however, that engage-ment of the private health sector is almost always designed with an overemphasis on regulation. Often these regulations prescribe unrealistic requirements for registration, licensing, use of medical equipment, or the type of professional who can provide particular services. These inap-propriate rules are often mitigated by almost uni-versally poor enforcement, which is considered one of the primary reasons for the poor quality of services offered by private providers. 109 Part of the trouble with delivering effective regulation is the lack of consensus on what consti-tutes \"good\" regulation outside of a particular con-text. Very little has been published about the 136 | Healthy Partnershipssuccesses and failures of government attempts to implement regulatory frameworks to ensure that the private sector is delivering what it is supposed to. What has been examined mostly concerns evaluations of government efforts to regulate pri-vate pharmacies and does not speci cally address service delivery. 110 Indeed, the criteria for good regulation are quite general. A regulatory frame-work is considered good if it is targeted, propor-tional, coherent, consistent, and transparent 111\u2014in other words, if the rules are understandable, if they address the problem they are meant to cor-rect, if they do not contradict other rules, if they establish a clear framework for what happens if they are not followed, and if the severity of the rules' intervention matches the severity of the problem. The challenge in measuring regulation, therefore, is to de ne constructs that unequivo- cally (that is, independent of the country context) have a positive impact on the functioning of the health system. The key constructs for the regulation domain are three simple, but core, aspects of the regula-tory function that should be carried out by the government. The rst construct is the proper registration and recording of new entrants into the market. While the team collected data on the registration process itself (in terms of steps and time), such a construct does not lend itself for inclusion in a measure of engagement. It is not clear whether lower entry barriers increase access (positive) or lower the quality standards for new entrants into the market (negative). Irrespective of the barrier to entry, however, new entrants into the market should be of cially registered. Hence, the cross- country comparison focused on attainment of this threshold, not on the process of registration, by looking at the quality of private-provider registry in each country. The second construct is the existence of a qual- ity regulatory framework. This is measured by the existence of rules covering the very basic regula-tory functions\u2014for opening a private facility, simi-lar rules for public and private clinics, and rules in place for inspecting a private clinic. Of course, such rules should be de ned according to a local context, taking enforcement capacity into account. But without any coherence in the approach to quality regulation, the engagement with the pri-vate health sector cannot be deemed to be com-plete. An important subconstruct here is the scope of the regulatory framework and whether a given country's regulatory framework includes the most important providers of health services. The impor-tance of traditional medicine in most countries in the Africa region suggests that their inclusion in the regulatory framework may be a useful proxy. The third construct is the effective enforce- ment of regulation. Enforcing basic regulations, as mentioned, is a key component of government engagement. This not only includes carrying out frequent inspections of private facilities, but also ensuring that enabling services are there to follow regulations, such as allowing private sector par-ticipation in continuing medical education oppor-tunities. The level of enforcement capacity varies widely from country to country, so any potential regulations must be aligned with the ability to enforce them. Financing Financial incentives are a main motivator of the private sector and are central to effective public-private engagement. Strategic government nanc- ing of private providers can create mutually bene cial arrangements that improve the ef cien- cy of available public funds while taking advan-tage of capacities in the private health sector. However, government nancing of the private health sector is contentious in terms of the overall bene t to the health system. This is especially the case in countries where the public system pro-vides much of the care and where the private health sector is small. Where the private sector provides a substantial proportion of care, howev-er, the assessment of nancing as an instrument provides some measure of how the governments are taking advantage of the capacities of the pri-vate sector. The key construct in the nancing domain is whether public funds are being channeled to the private health sector. This can take the form of government contracting of private providers to perform particular services. Strategic purchasing allows governments to use limited resources on Healthy Partnerships | 137 the most needed services, without due regard for who is providing those services. It also refers to nancial incentives for capital investments or operating costs (for example, tax exemptions) that can lower the operating costs for private facil-ities. An important area of nancing is the role of government in promoting a mechanism for risk pooling and sustainable nancing for the health system. Engagement with the private health sector is, then, also about fostering the expansion of cov-erage and depth of health insurance and making the private health sector accessible to enrollees. Public Provision of Services Direct government production of health care inputs and health services has an impact on the operating environment for the private health sec-tor. The intentional inclusion of the private health sector in the use of public resources enhances the ability of the for-pro t providers to operate, and contributes to better health performance overall. Through strategic allocation of resources, govern-ments can use public production to complement, crowd out, or build a supporting environment for private health care markets. For example, even though it is not directed at the private health sector, reliable and affordable infrastructure services are critical for private sec-tor development and economic growth. For health services businesses, access to electricity, water, and sewerage facilities are core technical inputs. Ef cient government production of these services has a tangible bene t in terms of the operating environment for private providers. In other areas, government services may have less of a bene t to the private health sector, but a great- er overall health bene t. Measuring public production, therefore, focus- es on whether the government is using its own production of health care inputs and services to promote and encourage collaboration between the public and private sector. The key construct is whether the private sector is explicitly included in government programs that can and should be open to all quali ed providers, regardless of what sector they come from. An example of this is private sec-tor participation in government or government-sanctioned vaccine programs. This measure also considers private sector involvement in govern-ment health system processes, such as the referral system in place for transferring patients from the private to the public sector and vice-versa. Challenges in de ning an optimal level of engagement The goal of the Report is to promote an optimal level of engagement, not only in terms of more or less engagement, but also in terms of quality engagement. De ning good engagement would enable direct assessment of country performance by measuring the distance between the observed level of engagement and the optimal level. How-ever, the empirical basis for de ning what consti- tutes an optimal level of engagement does not currently exist. Accordingly, the focus of the domains discussed is on those elements of engage-ment where some consensus exists that they are necessary. Since effective engagement is very low in many African health systems, the elements are de ned to cover only the basics of engagement. In other words, without most of these elements in place, it will be dif cult for governments to engage with the private health sector in a way that fosters improved access, quality, and ef ciency in health service delivery. The challenge moving forward will be to continually re ne the engagement framework and to make further progress in de n- ing the optimal level of engagement. 138 | Healthy Partnerships APPENDIX 4 \u2014Methodology for data collection Data collection, analysis, and validation Data were collected for 45 countries between February and July 2010. The only countries in the African region of the World Bank not covered in the Report are Eritrea and Somalia. Data source and collection The primary method of data collection was con - dential face-to-face interviews with key respon-dents during a one week in-country visit. An \"ideal\" key respondent list was created. The respondent list (box A4.1) covers a cross-section of the key stakeholders in the public and private sector, including from the Ministry of Health, regulators, for-pro t and not-for pro t private providers, and independent experts. The purpose of the list was to ensure as much standardization as possible across countries and to serve as a guide for plan-ning the schedule for in-country interviews.The minimum number of interviews was des- ignated at 8 per country; the team completed interviews with over 750 respondents for an aver-age of 16 respondents per country. In-country data collection was reinforced by desk research performed before and during the in-country visit, particularly in terms of collecting and verifying the de jure indicators. A standardized set of in-depth interview guide- lines covering each of the domains was used to col-lect the data. During the two rounds of pilot testing, less-relevant questions were dropped in order to keep the guidelines as concise as possible. The ques-tions in the guidelines took on different forms; the de jure indicators asked whether a particular policy or regulation exists as a matter of fact; de facto questions asked respondents to evaluate, on a cate-gorical scale, a particular aspect of engagement in practice. The scores across the domains and the assess- ment of engagement more generally apply primar-ily to the urban centers, since that is where the data collection and interviews took place (capital city and largest economic center, where applicable). The degree and nature of the engagement in rural areas was not separately assessed. The indicators across the domains likely represent an upper bound on the quality and intensity of engagement that is seen throughout the country. The same urban bias is found in other policy measures, such as the Doing Business indicators. It should be noted that the measures for Nigeria and Sudan represent a special case of this limitation, due to the fact that in both countries most governmental authority toward the private health sector is exercised at the state level. Therefore, for several measures in Nigeria and Sudan the assessment had to be made at the level of Lagos and Khartoum State, respectively, rather than at the national level. Respondent List BOX A4.1 In each country, key respondents include: Two to four independent experts: donor representatives, former of cials, academia Two to ve of cials from the Ministry of Health, Director of Planning, Health Information Management Unit, Inspectorate, Of ce of Stan- dards and Regulation, and the Public-Private Partnership unit One to four of cials from regulatory boards One state- or district-level Health Of cer Two to six representatives of the private health sector, which in- cludes representatives of the appropriate professional or private facility associations and owners of prominent private facilities, not the for-pro t sector. Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" data, 2010.Healthy Partnerships | 139 Data coding Once the data collection was nalized, the team coded a subset of the collected data into quantita-tive form. The data were primarily coded in bina-ry form (1 or 0). Five de facto indicators were coded on a categorical scale (1 to 4) to allow for more nuanced answers across countries, and for assigning a higher score to engagement in practice. A set of coding principles was developed for each of the indicators to guide assessor coding. Data validation To ensure accuracy of the coded data, the Health in Africa team engaged in two major rounds of data validation.

Note that the coding does NOT refer to the quality of the dialogue or to the outcomes it produces (such aspects would be found under implementation of engagement) but, rather, to whether it is currently taking place.Polic y and dialo gue continuedFirst, the team completed an initial veri cation by reviewing the coded data by comparing the coding with the raw data le containing the inter- views conducted in each country.

A positive assessment is reserved only for countries where the quality of the registry implies good implementation of registration and maintenance of the registry; where there are few informal providers. 3 - A registry of private health sector providers exists and is being used (i.e., updated at least once a year). Despite being used, the registry is not complete or fully representative of the private health sector. 2 - A registry of private sector providers exists, but it is not being used or updated in any practical way. 1 - A registry of private sector providers could not be readily produced by the registrar or designated body. The quality of regulation is good. The laws and regulations that govern the private health sector are deemed to be of good quality. Coding is based on respondent answers to the question, and a positive assessment is restricted to countries where there is a consensus among respondents that the laws and regulations are appropriate and reasonable. It does not explicitly take into account whether such laws and regulations are actively enforced. Regulation is enforced as intended. The Ministry of Health (or a designated body) generally enforces laws and regulations toward private health sector clinics. Coding is based on respondent answers to the question, and a positive assessment is restricted to countries where there is a con-sensus among respondents that the laws and regulations are enforced as written.

This includes contracts with individual medical practitioners. Price agreements between the private health sector and government health insurance organizations do not count. Subcontracting by public hospitals to private hospitals to provide services for which they are responsible and remunerated with public funds count as contracts. There are nancial incentives The government offers nancial incentives to the private health sector, including available to private health sector but not limited to tax breaks, tax credits, import duty reductions, and value-added operators. tax exemptions. The incentives have to be speci c to the private health sector; in other words, incentives that are available to all private sector businesses do not count. Evidence of implementation of the incentive scheme is required. If the incentive exists in theory, but it is never accessed by the private health sector, it does not count. Overall population covered by The approximate percentage of citizens covered by either public or private health health insurance. insurance, including community health insurance schemes, that would reimburse for treatment received in a private facility, is indicated by respondent answers:4 - more than 50%3 - more than 20%2 - more than 10%1 - less than 10%0 - no insurance.

There is a public-private referral There is a process in place to refer patients from the private sector to the public process. sector (or vice versa) for further treatment when required. It does not have to be a strictly formal process, as long as there is a method to facilitate the movement of patients. Patients moving from private to public or vice versa through self-referral do not count as part of the referral process. 142 | Healthy Partnerships APPENDIX 5 \u2014Scoping the private health care market The size and growth of a country's economy large- ly determines the size of the health sector. It also infl uences the relative share of public and private spending on health services. A large share of the population of low-income countries often lives in the rural areas and works in the informal sector. This limits the effective taxation capacity of their governments. In middle- and upper-income coun-tries, larger segments of the population work in urban settings and the formal employment sec-tors. This makes it relatively easy to tax workers at the source and to design a health care system nanced by government or payroll taxes. In most low-income countries, the formal urban employ- ment sector is small relative to the population in rural areas and in informal employment. Based on data from of cial National Health Accounts, total health spending on health care in Sub-Saharan Africa was US$68 billion in 2008, of which 45 percent was spent in the public sector and 55 percent was spent in the private sector. During 2001-06, Africa experienced remarkable economic growth (approximately 5 percent), and the relative share of public spending on health care increased annually by 1 percent, while the relative share of private spending on health care decreased annually by 1 percent. These trends are consistent with historical trends observed in other regions going through rapid growth. We use some basic back-of-the-envelope calculations to project how the overall size and the relative public/ private share could possibly develop in the com-ing years ( gure A5.1). While these calculations remain incomplete, they do indicate where gener-ally observed trends will lead African health care markets. These projections have signi cant implications for public sector engagement with the private sec-tor and for private sector development during the next decade or two. For example, there will be more money spent on the health care sector and a steady shift in relative spending from out-of-pocket private spending to collective, publicly mandated spending. Additional public spending, however, does not have to be spent only in the public sector. Governments often have little con-trol over how the current funding envelope is spent because of pressures from the wage bill and existing public service delivery obligations. But with good planning, future growth in public spending could (and should) be spent on services provided by public or private providers, which-ever is most effective at delivery. A shift away from out-of-pocket spending to more risk pool-ing, for example, through public nancing, is like- ly and a welcome prospect. Adept governments will take best possible advantage of the public and private capacities currently in the system that can best contribute to public health goals.Healthy Partnerships | 143 Figure A5.1 Africa: Spending on Health, by Source Donor aid with growth Total health expenditure with donor growthPrivate health expenditure with growthDonor aid without growthTotal health expenditure without donor growthPublic health expenditure with growth120 100 80604020 0 1990 199219941996199820002002200420062008201020122014201620182020Billions of US dollars Source: \"Healthy Partnerships\" analysis and projection based on WDI data, Healthy Partnerships 1.
