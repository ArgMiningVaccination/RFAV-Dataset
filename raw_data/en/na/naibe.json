This article explores the similarities, and discusses the way to achieve recovery from illness, healing and better health. The principles of naturopathic healing include the belief that the body has the natural ability to heal itself; it is about treating the whole person and preventing disease; first doing no harm and the role of the healer as the teacher or guide of the person towards better health. The Naturopathic approach to healing involves removing the obstacles to health; stimulating the body's healing mechanisms; strengthening weakened body systems; addressing pathology and symptoms. Naturopathy is a modern discipline which was born out of the medical profession over one hundred years ago. Naturopathy can also be described as holistic: i.e. it treats the whole person. Holistic healing however is nothing new - it is the basis of healing philosophy of many ancient healing methods. Ancient healing methods lacked the deep scientific understanding of our times. The better healing systems that have survived the test of time relied on one thing: observation. One of these healing systems and perhaps the oldest is the Ayurvedic healing tradition of India. In Ayurvedic medicine it was noted that there appeared to be five elements that governed nature. Of these, two elements (Earth and Water) governed structured and fluid material. The next was fire: this was the transition of the material world to the light and immaterial. The next two are air and space. Space is the most peculiar, because we relate it to a void, yet it is the only element which relates to the absence of material. Healing the body is similar: there is the solid structure of the body; the fluidity of the nutrients that are available to sustain and build it; the nervous system with its thinking patterns and emotions that guide how nutrients are used and how the structure of the body is maintained and built. Lastly, there are the body energy systems which are beyond the level of the nervous system and emotions. Then beyond that is the spiritual world - the world of the immaterial. What does this mean for healing? It means that addressing disease and bringing about healing is seldom just about a problem with our spine; or a nutrient that we lack, or a food which disagrees with us; or about our moods and stress levels or about using acupuncture to direct healing energy. Chronic health problems are usually complex. Expecting them to simply vanish overnight with a vitamin or a herb, a bit of relaxation and lavender oil, maybe a session with the chiropractor or osteopath or acupuncturist is usually wishful thinking. The approach needs to address the element of imbalance that most likely started the disturbance; however, it doesn't end there. Frequently the other elements of healing may also need to be addressed. An example illustrating this follows. A person presents with irritable bowel syndrome and is found to have a food intolerance. Frequently this is dairy, wheat, soy or nuts. The development of that intolerance is traced back to a point in their life where they were intensely physically or emotionally stressed. The food intolerance appears to be causing muscle cramps, restless legs and gut issues. When testing the individual's energy systems with kinesiology, a meridian imbalance is detected. Where does one start the healing process? By working through the elements of Ayurvedic philosophy, the one health problem extends through the structural, nutritional, emotional and energy aspects of the body. The obvious is to address the food intolerance; the less obvious is how to deal with the stress response that allowed the problem to develop and the structural and energy issues that go with it. Removing the offending food will bring instant relief, but that doesn't mean that the body won't go on to develop new food intolerances or allergies. It also doesn't mean that the person is better equipped to survive the next bout of physical or emotional stress. At ANHH the holistic approach to healing is done using an integrated approach with Ayurvedic philosophy. This can include testing for imbalances in nutrient levels, food intolerance reactions, and using kinesiology to identify and address structural and energy imbalances and poor adaptation patterns to stress.
