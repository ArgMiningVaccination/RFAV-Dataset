To reduce our environmental impact, our holistic spirit is distilled at McClintock Distilling Company, a wind-powered sustainable distillery that uses less water and recycles all of its byproducts back into farming. Discover Our Holistic Spirit Purposeful Ingredients, Enlightened Imbibing. Ingredients From Nature. Artichoke Artichoke plants are a type of thistle that originated in the Mediterranean and have been used for centuries for their plant compounds. Origen uses sustainably harvested artichoke leaves grown in the Loire Valley of France at a third-generation family farm. Elderberry Origen is made with Austrian elderberries which Europeans have used for centuries for their flavor profile and special plant compounds. Muscadine Grapes Muscadine grapes are native to and only grown in, the American South. Our muscadines are grown in Wray, Georgia at a sixth-generation family farm. Green Tea Leaves Green Tea leaves have been consumed for thousands of years throughout China and Japan, and more recently throughout the world. Origen uses the highest quality green tea leaves available in our patent pending formula. Taste The Difference Naturally pink from an infusion of raw plant extracts, Origen is velvety and delicate with subtle cherry fruit notes and a floral bouquet. Origen opens with notes of gentle olive fruit and a hint of salinity with a rounded floral backbone, followed by a balanced acidity carrying through with light vanilla on the finish. Drink it neat, sip it over ice, or stir it into your favorite cocktail.

Pay It Forward Community and connection are at the heart of our philosophy at Origen Holistic Spirits Company. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on the immediate need of reducing food insecurity and supporting underserved children during one of the most challenging times in history for kids who live in impoverished neighborhoods, through an organization called SoWhatElse.org. However, our main focus is on supporting environmental causes and sustainability. We are proud to support ForestPlanet.org where for each bottle of Origen Holistic Spirits sold, we plant a tree in locations in the world that have been heavily deforested. This plant a tree initiative is critical to our mission and long-term brand vision to make an impact on the earth and the people who inhabit it.
