ACUPUNCTURE ACCOLADES - I had never received an acupuncture treatment prior to seeing Maureen at Soul Sprout. Her warm energy made the experience so easy and immediately put me at ease. The main reason for my visit was back/neck pain from a pinched nerve. I immediately experienced relief within a few minutes of my session and needless to say I will continue to be a regular client. Jenna Mon - I love the folks at Soul Sprout. Everyone is so warm and inviting and the space is one of healing and meditation. I have gone on a regular basis for both acupuncture and massage and have always left the facility with a renewed sense of energy and mindfulness. Ben Jaeger-Thomas - I was in acupuncture treatment in NYC and was very lucky to find Soul Sprout when I moved to Short Hills. The practitioners I worked with were amazingly caring, knowledgeable and accommodating. Just in a span of a couple of sessions I was able to achieve the desired result. Dr. Giese was especially supportive. Her calmness and expertise was a major source of confidence in a very trying time in my life. Jeanne Hainz - Jennifer was amazing, attentive and she really listened. She created a rapport and environment that fostered complete trust and relaxation. I booked my next 2 appointments as a result.
