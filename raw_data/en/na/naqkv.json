To use essential oils in hospital settings requires aromatherapy certification by an accredited organization, permission to use by the unit or health care facility, and it needs to be one of the modalities your state licensing board permits you to use as a health care professional. Nurses have been the leaders in bringing this modality to the health care field, although many occupational therapists and physical therapists are currently getting certified to use this modality among a variety of different populations. Massage therapists, chiropractors, physicians, and neurologists are just a few examples of other disciplines recognizing the value of getting certified and safely using clinical aromatherapy in their practices. ](https://www.ot-innovations.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/aroma_page_ver2.jpg) For occupational therapists or other health care professionals interested in becoming certified it is necessary to attend a certification course.
