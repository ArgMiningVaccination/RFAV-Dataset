[](https://organicindiausa.com) Tulsi: Sacred Plant of the Gods ORGANIC INDIA's foundational herb, Tulsi, also called Holy Basil, was chosen for its broad-spectrum health-supporting properties. Tulsi is a flowering plant in the mint family and has beautifully aromatic leaves. This exalted medicinal herb, native to the Indian subcontinent, is packed with immune-modulating phytochemicals that support the body in maintaining a state of vitality. It is also a potent adaptogen, which means it performs significant physiological actions that help the whole body-mind system adapt to and relieve mental, physical and environmental stress. Not only is Tulsi a powerful plant on its own, it works synergistically with other Ayurvedic adaptogenic herbs such as Turmeric and Ashwagandha, making it the perfect enhancer for any tea or supplement. It also is said to behold a nurturing, feminine energy or essence according to the traditional Indian medicine system. That's why balancing Tulsi is included in many Ayurvedic medicinal formulas, to get the most benefit of key herbs and spices for deep nourishment and sustained wellness.

Traditional Significance of Tulsi In the ancient Vedic Bhagavata Purana text, Tulsi, called \"Queen of Herbs,\" is noted as the plant embodiment of Lakshmi, wife of Vishnu and the goddess of wealth and generosity. In Hindu mythology, Tulsi is regarded as a living gateway between heaven and earth, and believed to be a manifestation of the divine within the plant kingdom. But it's not just in India that Tulsi was significant. As Tulsi traveled west along the early trade routes from Asia to Europe, it became known to Christians as \"sacred\" or \"holy\" basil and was used in rituals. Across cultures, Tulsi was a symbol of purity and used for a range of physical, mental and spiritual purposes. It was used in traditional folk medicine for immune and respiratory support, kidney support, heart health, oral health, eye health and much more. The leaves were prepared in various classical, homemade preparations like extracts, powders and teas. Where is Tulsi grown? Our Tulsi is grown in the Uttar Pradesh region, located in northern India edging on the foothills of the Himalayas south of Nepal. Tulsi is believed to have originated here in north central India, but grows throughout the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh, Eastern Nepal, China and much of Southeast Asia. Tulsi is hardy in zones 10 and 11. Who is it for? Tulsi supplements and teas are wonderful for anyone who is looking for a greater sense of relaxation, clarity and wellbeing. It can be a great herbal ally to more easily manage physical, environmental and mental stressors. It is advised that children, and pregnant and nursing women not consume Tulsi. Be sure to consult with your doctor before consuming Tulsi if you are on medications. \"Emerging science on tulsi, which reinforces ancient Ayurvedic wisdom, suggests that tulsi is a tonic for the body, mind and spirit that offers solutions to many modern day health problems.\" Tulsi for Healthy Conscious Living ORGANIC INDIA's tulsi-based teas, infusions and supplements combine Ayurvedic wisdom with modern science in service to a community dedicated to healthy, conscious living.
