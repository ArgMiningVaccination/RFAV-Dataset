The currently available antifungal drugs leave very limited choices for clinical physicians to deal with such situation, not to mention the long-standing problems of emerging drug resistance, side effects and heavy economic burdens imposed to patients. Therefore, new antifungal drugs are urgently needed. Screening drugs from natural products and using synthetic biology strategies are very promising for antifungal drug development. Chinese medicine is a vast library of natural products of biologically active molecules. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, preparations used to treat fungal diseases usually have antifungal and immunomodulatory functions. This suggests that if antifungal drugs are used in combination with immunomodulatory drugs, better results may be achieved. Studies have shown that the active components of TCM have strong antifungal or immunomodulatory effects and have broad application prospects. In this paper, the latest research progress of antifungal and immunomodulatory components of TCM is reviewed and discussed, hoping to provide inspiration for the design of novel antifungal compounds and to open up new horizons for antifungal treatment strategies.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-12-28", "cleaned_text": "Chinese Medicine [https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12010048](https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12010048) [Synthetic Biology Brings New Opportunity for 1. Introduction by contrast, can be life-threatening. The infection can spread to many organ systems and meninges. Under different circumstances, the mortality rate can vary from 35% to 90% [ [2](#B2-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Common continuous efforts to develop antifungal drugs, the availability of drugs for clinical use remains limited. At present, commonly used antifungal drugs in clinics are azole, polyene, echinomycin, terbinafine, and so on. However, existing drugs have problems such as drug resistance, high price, high toxicity, and serious side effects, such as renal toxicity. It is an urgent and challenging task to find new antifungal drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity. [6](#B6-antibiotics-12-00048)], while the main active molecules in Lonicera japonica Flos and Taraxacum officinale L. are proven to have anti-inflammatory effects [ [7](#B7-antibiotics-12-00048), [8](#B8-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Patients with vaginitis suffer a lot from persistent itch caused by inflammation response. The lotion can reduce the itching and at the same time inhibit pathogens. It can both treat the symptoms and eliminate the causes of the disease. The combination of antifungal drugs and immunomodulators may be a promising antifungal treatment strategy and an effective way to develop new antifungal drugs. Therefore, this paper reviewed two kinds of substances isolated from TCM: those with antifungal effects and those with immunomodulatory L. [12](#B12-antibiotics-12-00048)]. We can extract active substances from these TCMs with water, alcohol, chloroform, ethyl acetate, ether, and petroleum ether. The volatile oil, ketones, alkaloids, aldehydes, phenylpropanoids, and saponins, also exhibit potent antifungal activity [ [13](#B13-antibiotics-12-00048)]. We reviewed substances isolated from mechanisms of dioscin may be associated with inhibiting the virulence factors of C. albicans, including the morphological transformation, the production of phospholipase, and the adherence to the abiotic surface [ [14](#B14-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Another computational study showed that dioscin can bind to the glucoamylase enzyme that is produced in many fungi by molecular docking [ [55](#B55-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [16](#B16-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [56](#B56-antibiotics-12-00048), [57](#B57-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Eucalyptus robusta is widely distributed in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other southern areas of China, and it is commonly used in the traditional medicine of ethnic minorities. Eucalyptus leaves are used to treat respiratory infections, intestinal infections, malaria, trachoma, otitis media, keratitis, dermatitis, etc. The essential oil extracted from the leaves is also used as a preservative. Eucarobustol E, as an FPM from the leaves of Eucalyptus robusta, has a broad-spectrum antifungal effect with MIC ranging from 4 to 16 \u00b5g/mL. It also inhibits C. albicans biofilms in both the formation phase and mature phase, and the mechanism might involve the negative regulation of hyphal growth due to the inhibition of carbon flow towards ergosterol. This mechanism is totally different from the known mechanisms of existing antifungal drugs and may provide a novel strategy for fungal infection treatment [ [18](#B18-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [58](#B58-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [20](#B20-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Thymol also exhibits with MICs ranging from 20-51 \u00b5g/mL, and the mode of antifungal action seems to be related to the ergosterol of yeast [ [23](#B23-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Another study demonstrated that thymol regulated several signaling pathways, such as calcineurin, unfolded protein response, and the HOG-MAPK pathway [ [59](#B59-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [20](#B20-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [19](#B19-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 2.2. Volatile Oils [60](#B60-antibiotics-12-00048)]. It seems that natural medicines with antifungal effects are mostly found in Lamiaceae, A similar work was conducted by another team. Bona E. et al. tested the sensitivity of 30 vaginal C. albicans strains to 12 essential oils, and mint, basil, lavender, tea tree oil, and oregano were more efficient in inhibiting fungal growth and activity than the traditional antifungal drug clotrimazole. The MICs of mint, basil, lavender, and tea tree oil were 0.25-4% v/v for most strains, with values >4% for others. The oregano volatile MICs were lower than 1% v/v in 64% of the strains. They also found that the mechanism of essential oils in antifungal activity was associated with cell wall and membrane damage [ [25](#B25-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [29](#B29-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Notably, turmeric oil exhibits low toxicity towards humans. It did not show any irritation or adverse effect at a 5% concentration for up to 3 weeks in a clinical trial [ [29](#B29-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Moreover, the main component of turmeric oil, Ar-turmerone, exhibits more potent antifungal activity against dermatophytes than ketoconazole, with MICs ranging from 3.90 to 7.81 g/mL [ [30](#B30-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Another important substance isolated from Curcuma longa L. is curcumin, which also arouses the wide interest of scientists. It is reported to have many bioactivities, such as antitumor, many common pathogens. It inhibits Candida species growth with an MIC90 ranging from 250 to 650 g/mL. This includes clinical isolates and fluconazole-resistant strains of C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. and C. guilliermondii [32](#B32-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Curcumin also shows antifungal activity against C. neoformans and C. dubliniensis with an MIC of 32 g/mL [ [34](#B34-antibiotics-12-00048)]. In addition, curcumin and its derivatives show synergy effects with fluconazole against resistant C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei, with the FICIs ranging from 0.078 to 0.563 [ [33](#B33-antibiotics-12-00048)]. The antifungal mechanisms of curcumin include causing oxidative stress and inhibiting thymidine uptake 1. Curcumin also alters silibinin seems not stable or uniform. Dayanne R. O. et al. reported that silibinin inhibits C. albicans, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis with MICs at 1024 \u00b5g/mL [ [36](#B36-antibiotics-12-00048)]. In another study, however, the MICs of silibinin against C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were 19.3 \u00b5g/mL and 9.6 \u00b5g/mL, respectively [ [37](#B37-antibiotics-12-00048)]. One possible reason for the differences is that the strains used in the tests are different and silibinin does not exhibit stable or uniform antifungal activities against those strains. Silibinin at 100 \u00b5g/mL also inhibits C. albicans biofilm formation to approximately 50%, and the mode of action involves causing membrane damage to fungal cells [ [65](#B65-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [66](#B66-antibiotics-12-00048)], anti-inflammatory [ [67](#B67-antibiotics-12-00048)], and bioactive components of propolis are flavonoids. Propolis production is influenced by many environmental factors such as local climate and the plants nearby. Therefore, propolis from different regions contains different kinds and amounts of flavonoids, and it consequently has different bioactivities [ [69](#B69-antibiotics-12-00048)]. In Chinese propolis, the four major flavonoids pinobanksin, chrysin, and 3-O-acetylpinobanksin. All the have activities against C. albicans, with MICs of 100 \u00b5g/mL, 25 \u00b5g/mL, 100 \u00b5g/mL, and 50 \u00b5g/mL, respectively [ [39](#B39-antibiotics-12-00048)]. The antifungal mechanism of propolis is related to the induction of apoptosis through metacaspase and Ras signaling. It is also reported that propolis disrupts the expression of several genes involving pathogenesis, cell adhesion, biofilm formation, filamentous growth, and phenotypic switching [ [70](#B70-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [40](#B40-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [71](#B71-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Both of the two major components exhibit antifungal activities. The MIC of baicalein is 25 \u00b5g/mL [ [41](#B41-antibiotics-12-00048)]. It induces the apoptosis of C. albicans cells and has potent synergy with fluconazole against resistant strains, with an FICI of 0.039 [ [42](#B42-antibiotics-12-00048)]. The derivatives of baicalein even show greater synergistic antifungal effects with FICIs < 0.007 [ [72](#B72-antibiotics-12-00048)]. There is also evidence that baicalein reduces the MIC of amphotericin B with an FICI ranging from 0.031 to 0.677, and further mechanism investigation indicated that the combination of the two agents accelerates C. albicans apoptosis [ [73](#B73-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 2.4. Alkaloids [43](#B43-antibiotics-12-00048)]. The antifungal activity of berberine alone is unstable and weak in some situations. Therefore, researchers have turned their attention to combining berberine with other drugs. Our group members found that berberine showed potent synergy with fluconazole against fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains. We tested 40 clinical isolates, and the median FICI was 0.034 (range, 0.017 to 0.127) [ [44](#B44-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Further mechanism investigation showed that berberine played a major role in killing the fungi in the synergy, and fluconazole increased the intracellular berberine concentration by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis in cell membranes [ [74](#B74-antibiotics-12-00048), [75](#B75-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Berberine also exhibits synergy with other antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B and terbinafine. It was reported that the combination of berberine and amphotericin B reduced approximately 75% of the amphotericin B dose in a mouse model [ [76](#B76-antibiotics-12-00048)], and 100 \u00b5g/mL of berberine can effectively assist the antifungal potential of terbinafine [ [77](#B77-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Berberine inhibits biofilms of the Candida species in a dose-dependent manner, and 40, 5120, 320, 40, and 1280 g/mL berberine study reported that sanguinarine inhibited 10 C. albicans strains, with the MICs within the range of 37.5-50 \u00b5g/mL. Sanguinarine also showed anticandidal effects in a murine model at the dose of 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, and the mode of action is related to ergosterol synthesis deficiency in cells [ [46](#B46-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Sanguinarine can also inhibit C. albicans biofilms, and 3.2 \u00b5g/mL of sanguinarine significantly inhibits C. albicans biofilm formation by over 90% and destroys mature biofilms by 68.3%. The possible mechanism of sanguinarine's antibiofilm effect involves its inhibitory effect on adhesion and hypha formation due to cAMP pathway suppression [ [78](#B78-antibiotics-12-00048)]. In addition to C. albicans and C. neoformans, the antifungal spectrum of chelerythrine consists of C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis. According to Gong et al., the MICs of chelerythrine against C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis are 2, 16, 16, and 8 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, and the mechanism investigation showed that chelerythrine inhibited hyphal growth, increased intracellular calcium concentration, induced the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and inhibited drug transporter activity [ [47](#B47-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [79](#B79-antibiotics-12-00048), [80](#B80-antibiotics-12-00048)], and the extract of P. betle showed inhibitory effects against C. albicans according to a disk diffusion test [ [81](#B81-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 2.5. Quinones [82](#B82-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Plumbagin, for example, exhibits antifungal effects with an MIC of 0.78 \u00b5g/mL [82](#B82-antibiotics-12-00048)]. In a recent study, plumbagin exhibited antifungal effects against C. neoformans with an MIC of 8 \u00b5g/mL. Further study showed that plumbagin disrupted cell membrane integrity and reduced metabolic activities of the pathogen. It also damaged formation-phase and mature-phase biofilms of C. neoformans at concentrations of 64 and 128 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. A mechanism study confirmed that plumbagin damaged biofilm by down-regulating FAS1 and FAS2 expression [ and bis-naphthoquinone, which can be extracted from Ceratostigma plumbaginoides, has an MIC of C. neoformans, T. cutaneum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with MICs ranging from 4 to 16 g/mL details in [Table 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-t001)) [ [51](#B51-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Using was H3 lysine 56 residue acetylation via HST3 in albicans and execute its antifungal activity [ [83](#B83-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Shikonin can also inhibit the formation of biofilms and destroy the maintenance of mature biofilms at concentrations of 1-32 \u00b5g/mL and 4-16 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. This antibiofilm activity was confirmed in a mouse vulvovaginal candidiasis model. The possible mechanisms involve down-regulating hypha- and adhesion-specific gene expression and inducing farnesol production [ [52](#B52-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 2.6. Coumarin [6](#B6-antibiotics-12-00048), [53](#B53-antibiotics-12-00048)], and further study indicated that the mechanism of synergy is associated with endogenous ROS accumulation [ [53](#B53-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [84](#B84-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 2.7. Others [85](#B85-antibiotics-12-00048)]. EC exhibits antifungal effects against 26 isolates of C. albicans, with MICs ranging from 64 to 256 \u00b5g/mL, and the combination of EC and fluconazole shows synergism in 14 out of 26 tested isolates, with FICIs ranging from 0.047 to 0.375. Similar results are observed in C. albicans biofilms. EC shows no antibiofilm effects at up to 256 \u00b5g/mL. However, EC and fluconazole exhibit synergy against 11 out of 26 isolates, with FICIs ranging from 0.002 to 0.375. The synergy mechanisms may be related to the inhibition of hydrolase secretion and drug efflux function of C. [ TCM 3.1. [86](#B86-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)). It is reported chlorogenic acid exhibits anti-proliferation activity against the fibroblast-like synoviocyte cell line (RSC-364), which is stimulated by IL-6. The main mechanism involves JAK/STAT and NF-B signaling cascades. Chlorogenic acid inhibits these two pathways by suppressing the expression of p-STAT3, JAK1, p50, and IKK, therefore inducing apoptosis in RSC-364 [ [7](#B7-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Interestingly, a recent study revealed that chlorogenic acid also induces apoptosis in fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. and exhibits antifungal activity. Molecular docking demonstrates that chlorogenic acid binds to several important drug targets, including thymidylate kinase, CYP51, and ALS3 [ has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in many diseases, such as arthritis, colitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and periodontal disease [ [90](#B90-antibiotics-12-00048)]. It also inhibits LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells. The anti-inflammation target of rosmarinic acid involves the NF-B/MAPK pathway. It suppresses the activation of the NF-B/MAPK pathway and thereby reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)), was confirmed to have anti-inflammatory effects in many studies. It can reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines, including NO, PGE2, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, [8](#B8-antibiotics-12-00048), [93](#B93-antibiotics-12-00048), [94](#B94-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Research on the anti-inflammatory effects of luteolin dates back at least 20 years [ [95](#B95-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Luteolin can reduce LPS-induced inflammation both in vivo and in vitro. A mechanism study showed that luteolin inhibits the pro-inflammatory molecules TNF- and ICAM-1 expression in mice [ [95](#B95-antibiotics-12-00048)], and in RAW264.7 cells, luteolin also inhibits NO, IL-1, IL-6 in addition to TNF- [ [96](#B96-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [Figure 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)) is another common flavonoid in these \"cold-natured\" herbs. It also can be found in some vegetables and fruits. The anti-inflammatory effect of quercetin has been reported in many diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and atherosclerosis, in vivo or in vitro [ [97](#B97-antibiotics-12-00048), [98](#B98-antibiotics-12-00048)]. It was also in a clinical trial for treating rheumatoid arthritis [ [99](#B99-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Quercetin inhibits inflammation via IL-6), inhibiting cyclooxygenase and mast cell stability [ [97](#B97-antibiotics-12-00048), [100](#B100-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [Figure 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)) is [98](#B98-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Rutin shows anti-inflammatory effects in activated human neutrophils, through inhibiting TNF- and NO production, as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity [ [101](#B101-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Rutin also attenuates advanced glycation end product induced inflammation on human chondrocytes. The study revealed that rutin targets BCL-2 and TRAF-6 in the NF-B/MAPK pathway to inhibit inflammation and treat osteoarthritis [ [102](#B102-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 3.3. Volatile Oils [88](#B88-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Menthol ( [Figure 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)) can be beneficial in rats with acetic acid-induced acute colitis. The protective effect is related to the inhibition of MPO, as well as the reduction of and IL-6 [ reported to reduce LPS-induced inflammation in mice. The possible mechanism is that menthone inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and consequently reduces inhibits inflammation both in vivo and in vitro. In a zebrafish model, phillyrin reduced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner and improved survival. A mechanism study showed that phillyrin inhibits the MyD88/IB/NF-B signaling pathway, but not ERK1/2 MAPKs or JNK MAPKs. It reduces TNF-, By also alleviates inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 in Huh-7 cells. It decreases release Fructus that targets the NF-B signaling pathway and shows anti-inflammatory effects. It inhibits LPS-induced inflammation in LX2 and RAW 264.7 cell lines. Molecular docking indicated that phillygenin has an affinity for many proteins in the NF-B pathway, such as IKK, p65, IB, and TAK1 in Forsythiae and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects as well. It attenuates inflammation in different cells by inhibiting COX-2 expression, which is an essential protein in inflammation [ [109](#B109-antibiotics-12-00048), [110](#B110-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Arctiin also activates Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and blocks the RIG-I/JNK MAPK signaling of A549 cells in inflammation induced by H9N2 avian influenza virus [ [110](#B110-antibiotics-12-00048)]. In an LPS-induced acute lung injury mice model, arctiin significantly ameliorated lung histopathological changes and decreased lung MPO activity. The mechanism study suggested that arctiin targets the PI3K/AKT/NF-B signaling pathway by inhibiting PI3K/Akt NF-B from flavescens. It balanced the Th1/Th2 axis and improved rheumatoid arthritis in a rat model. By regulating the NF-B pathway, matrine reduced the level of be isolated from Radix Stephaniae Tetrandrae. It is reported to have inhibitory effects on the proliferation of T cells via the NF-B pathway. Tetrandrine prevents the degradation of IB and inhibits nuclear translocation of p65 by blocking IKK and IKK activities, and tetrandrine down-regulates the activation of MAPK including JNK, p38, and ERK, as well as the downstream transcription factor AP-1 [ [113](#B113-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Isotetrandrine has a chemical structure very similar to tetrandrine, differing only in the stereochemistry at the chiral centers ( [Figure 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)). Isotetrandrine has stronger inhibitory effects against the proliferation of T cells than those of tetrandrine [ [114](#B114-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 3.6. Polysaccharides [115](#B115-antibiotics-12-00048)]. On the other hand, Ganoderma polysaccharide activates the immune responses by binding to dectin-1, TLRs, MR, or CR3 on cells (DCs), granulocytes, neutrophils, and natural killing cells. It also can directly activate lymphocytes and neutrophils [116](#B116-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 3.7. Glycosides [Figure 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)) is a monoterpene active component of Paeonia lactiflora Pallas. Paeoniflorin has protective effects on many autoimmune diseases in animal models, including arthritis, liver injuries, allergic contact dermatitis, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and asthma [ [117](#B117-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Paeoniflorin regulates the activation of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages. It also inhibits DC maturation and pro-inflammatory mediator production. As for pathways, paeoniflorin inhibits the MAPK signaling pathway, the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in immune cells [ [117](#B117-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [Figure 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)) is one of the glycosides in Radix Ginseng. It has various immune-modulating activities, for example, enhancing the immune activity of Th cells. Ginsenoside Rg1 can help mice fight against disseminated candidiasis. Ginsenoside Rg1 has no antifungal activity against C. albicans in vitro. However, it can promote CD4+T cell immune response mediated by Th1 cells in infected mice and consequently induces cytokine release including IFN-, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10, exhibiting protective effects in mice [ [118](#B118-antibiotics-12-00048)]. [Figure 1](#antibiotics-12-00048-f001)) can be found in Radix Bupleuri and is one of the major bioactive components of medicine. Saikosaponin d helps generate functional mature neutrophils in cancer chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The generated neutrophils are capable of resisting infection both in vitro and in vivo. This immune enhancing effect is mediated by the CBL-ERK1/2 pathway, resulting in neutrophil differentiation [ [119](#B119-antibiotics-12-00048)]. 4. Discussion 4.1. Material Basis of TCM for Treating Fungal Infection Diseases [120](#B120-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Quaternary ammonium alkaloids, such as chelerythrine, bearing a quaternary nitrogen atom, have oxidative effects and are thus usually toxic to cells. An evaluation of the acute hepatotoxicity effect of chelerythrine at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (i.p.) showed that chelerythrine caused marked parenchymal damage in the liver [ [121](#B121-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Meanwhile, EC50 of shikonin against V79 cell lines was 0.4 g/mL by an MTT assay [ [122](#B122-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Through structural modification, chemicals of these two families are promising antifungal lead compounds. [123](#B123-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Polysaccharides and glycosides are two major active components in ginseng, both of which are very promising immunomodulatory drug candidates [ [124](#B124-antibiotics-12-00048)]. They are relatively safe in vivo [ [125](#B125-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Polysaccharides are a relatively complex mixture of components and are therefore difficult to synthesize in vitro, and biosynthesis may be a good way to develop such drugs. 4.2. Mechanism of Chinese Medicine in Treating Fungal Infectious Diseases [Figure 2](#antibiotics-12-00048-f002)). Most of the currently reported chemicals do not have a clear target. For the TCM ingredients that act on fungi, the main mechanisms involve inhibiting the virulence factors of fungi (hyphal growth, cell adhesion, production of phospholipase), disturbing fungal cell wall synthesis, damaging the fungal cell membrane, inhibiting the mitosis process, altering the glycerophospholipid metabolism, influencing the drug efflux function, increasing intracellular ROS levels, and inducing apoptosis. Two related pathways in fungal cells are the HOG-MAPK pathway and the Ras-cAMP pathway. Among those chemicals, shikonin is reported to promote histone H3 on lysine 56 residue acetylation via HST3 albicans [ [83](#B83-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Again, shikonin exhibits strong antifungal activities with a broad spectrum and a clear binding target, making it a good candidate to become a lead compound in antifungal drug development. [126](#B126-antibiotics-12-00048), [127](#B127-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Nearly all the anti-inflammatory functions of TCMs listed here are related to the NF-B pathway ( [Figure 3](#antibiotics-12-00048-f003)). MAPK cascades mediate the from extracellular signals to intracellular reactions [ [126](#B126-antibiotics-12-00048)]. There are at least three MAPK cascade signal transduction pathways that are involved in the effects down-regulate protein expressions in the MAPK pathway. This reduces inflammatory responses. The JAK/STAT pathway is another type of cascade that translates extracellular chemical signals into the permission of JAK phosphorylation and STAT activation. The pathway is related to many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune regulation [ [128](#B128-antibiotics-12-00048)]. Chlorogenic acid and paeoniflorin can inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway and alleviate the inflammation response. However, both the MAPK pathway and the JAK/STAT pathway are involved in many essential biological processes, and this prevents the two pathways from being good anti-inflammatory targets. Inhibiting targets in these pathways may cause many adverse effects. 4.3. Exploitation of TCM and Development of New Antifungal Drugs [129](#B129-antibiotics-12-00048), [130](#B130-antibiotics-12-00048)], although artemisinin production costs may increase as a result. The application of modern technology to improve the yield and economic benefits of the effective components can effectively solve some difficulties in the application of TCM.
