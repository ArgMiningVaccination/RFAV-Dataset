Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge GRIFFITH . Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge ROGERS , with whom Chief Judge GINSBURG joins. GRIFFITH , Circuit Judge : This case presents the question whether the Constitution provides terminally ill patients a rightof access to experimental drugs that have passed limited safety3 trials but have not been proven safe and effective. The district court held there is no such right. A divided panel of this Courtheld there is. Because we conclude that there is no fundamentalright \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\" ofaccess to experimental drugs for the terminally ill, see Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 702, 720-21 (1997) Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion)), we affirm th e judgment of the district court. I. A. The Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs (the \"Alliance\") is an organization of terminally illpatients and their supporters that seeks expanded access toexperimental drugs for the term inally ill. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\" or \"Act\"), however, generally prohibitsaccess to new drugs unless and un til they have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a). Gaining FDA approval can be a long process. First,an experimental drug's sponsor ( e.g., a drug company) must submit an application for approval. See id. \u00a7 355(a). Because no drug may be approved without a finding of \"substantialevidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or isrepresented to have,\" id. \u00a7 355(d)(5), an application must contain \"full reports of investigations which have been made toshow whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use,\" id. \u00a7 355(b)(1)(A). Such reports rely in large measure on clinical trials with human subjects. But before a sponsor can even begin human testing, it must submit for the FDA's approval an investigational new drugapplication (\"IND\"), see id. \u00a7 355(i)(1); see also 21 C.F.R. pt. 312, containing detailed information establishing that human4 1 In FDA parlance, experimental drugs that have not yet been approved for public use are deemed \"investigational drug[s].\" See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.3(b).testing is appropriate, see 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.23. Once the application for human testing has been approved, see id. \u00a7 312.20, several phases of clinical testing begin. TheAlliance's amended complaint alleges that this testing processis an extremely lengthy one, requiring nearly seven years for theaverage experimental drug. 1 Am. Compl. \u00b6 15. Clinical testing for safety and effectiveness requires three or sometimes four phases. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21. Phase I involves the initial introduction of a new drug into humansubjects. A Phase I study usually consists of twenty to eightysubjects and is \"designed to determine the metabolism andpharmacologic actions of the [new] drug in humans, the sideeffects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gainearly evidence on effectiveness.\" Id. \u00a7 312.21(a)(1). Although gathering data on effectiveness may be part of Phase I, itsprimary focus is to determine whether the drug is safe enoughfor continued human testing. See id. Phase II studies are \"well controlled\" and \"closely monitored\" clinical trials of no morethan several hundred subjects, used to evaluate both the\"effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication\" and its\"common short-term side effects and risks.\" Id. \u00a7 312.21(b). Phase III studies are expanded clinical trials of several hundred to several thousand subjects designed to\"gather . . . additional informati on about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship ofthe drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician5 2 In some circumstances, a Phase IV review is conducted, which \"delineate[s] additional information about the drug's risks,benefits, C.F.R. \u00a7 312.85. 355(n)(3) of Title 21, United States Code, provides: The Secretary shall make appointments to each panel . . . so that each panel shall consist of\u2014 (A) members who are qualified by training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness ofthe drugs to be referred to the panel and who, to the extent feasible, possess skill and experience in thedevelopment, manufacture, or utilization of suchdrugs; (B) members with diverse expertise in such fields as clinical and administrative medicine, pharmacy,pharmacology, pharmacoeconomics, biological andphysical sciences, and other related professions; (C) a representative of consumer interests, and alabeling.\" Id. \u00a7 312.21(c).2 At any time during the clinical trials, a drug sponsor is required to notify the FDA of \"[a]nyadverse experience associated with the use of the drug that isboth serious and unexpected,\" id. \u00a7 312.32(c)(1)(A), and the FDA may order a \"clinical hold\" halting the trials if itdetermines that safety concerns so warrant, id. \u00a7 312.42. To guide the clinical testing process, Congress has directed theFDA to establish \"[s]cientific advisory panels\" to \"provid[e]expert scientific advice and recommendations to the Secretaryregarding a clinical investigation of a drug or the approval formarketing of a drug.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(n)(1). These panels mustinclude scientists from a variety of disciplines. See id. \u00a7 355(n)(3). 3 6 representative of interests of the drug manufacturing industry not directly affected by the matter to bebrought before the panel; and (D) two or more members who are specialists or have other expertise in the par ticular disease or condition for which the drug under review is proposed to beindicated. 4 The FDA has several other regulatory programs designed to hasten research of the safety and effectiveness of drugs for terminallyor severely ill patients and allow early access where scientifically andTerminally ill patients need not , however, always await the results of the clinical testing process. The FDA and Congresshave created several programs designed to provide early accessto promising experimental drugs when warranted. For example,under the \"treatment IND\" progr am, the FDA may approve use of an investigational drug by pa tients not part of the clinical trials for the treatment of \"serious or immediately life-threatening disease[s]\" if th ere exists \"no comparable or satisfactory alternative drug or other therapy,\" 21 C.F.R.\u00a7 312.34(a), (b)(1)(i)-(ii); if \"[t]he drug is under investigation in a controlled clinical trial,\" id. \u00a7 312.34(b)(1)(iii); and if the drug's sponsor \"is actively pursuing marketing approval of theinvestigational drug with due diligence,\" id. \u00a7 312.34(b)(1)(iv). The FDA reserves the right, however, to deny any treatmentIND request if (1) the agency believes there is no \"reasonablebasis\" to conclude that the drug is effective; or (2) granting the request the patient[] . . . to an unreasonable and significant additional risk of illness or injury.\" Id. \u00a7 312.34(b)(3). Sponsors may not profit from any approvedtreatment IND program and may only \"recover costs ofmanufacture, research, development, and handling of theinvestigational drug.\" Id. \u00a7 312.7(d)(3). 47 medically warranted. For example, under its \"Fast Track\" program, the agency has \"established procedures designed to expedite thedevelopment, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended totreat persons with life-threatening and severely-debilitating illnesses,especially where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists.\" 21 C.F.R.\u00a7 312.80. Fast Track allows the FDA to waive its IND applicationrequirement if it is \"unnecessary or cannot be achieved,\" id. \u00a7 312.10, and even allows a waiver request to be made \"[i]n an emergency . . . by telephone or other rapid communication,\" id. The \"Accelerated Approval\" program provides a truncated approval process for \"certainnew drug products that have been studied for their safety andeffectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and thatprovide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments.\" Id. \u00a7 314.500. The FDA categorizes some new drugs, including nearly all cancer drugs, as \"priority drugs\" and seeks toaccelerate their availability. B. Concluding that the FDA's cu rrent process for early access to new drugs was inadequate to meet the needs of its terminally ill members, the Alliance submitted its own proposals to theFDA. Those proposals culminated in a \"citizen petition\" to theFDA, see 21 C.F.R. there is a \"different risk-benefit tradeoff facing patients who are terminally ill andwho have no other treatment opti ons.\" Abigail Alliance Citizen Petition, In re Tier 1 Initial Approval Program to Expedite the Availability of Lifesaving Drugs 9 (June 11, 2003). Although the Alliance agreed that \"[e]xtensive marshalling of evidenceregarding drug interactions, dose optimization, and the like\" is\"appropriate for new drugs to treat patients with otheralternatives . . . [,] these steps may well entail a delay that isfatal\" for terminally ill patients. Id. The Alliance contended that these patients \"should have the ability to opt for a newtreatment that has met a lower ev identiary hurdle with respect to safety and efficacy.\" Id. The Alliance's proposal suggested that8 the FDA allow early access based upon \"the risk of illness, injury, or death from the disease in the absence of the drug.\" Id. at 4. Accordingly, the Allia nce requested that the FDA promulgate new regulations that would allow sponsors to marketexperimental drugs, under some circumstances, after thecompletion of Phase I trials. The FDA never responded to the Alliance's citizen petition, but did respond to the Alliance's earlier submissions. Afternoting that a number of senior F DA officials had reviewed those submissions, the agency concluded that the Alliance \"raisedseveral important questions about expanded access that webelieve deserve further consider ation,\" but questioned whether the specific proposal put forward by the Alliance \"would havethe intended desirable effects for patients.\" Letter from Peter J.Pitts, Associate Commissioner for External Relations,Department of Health and Human Services, to Frank Burroughs,President, Abigail Alliance for Better Access to DevelopmentalDrugs 3 (Apr. 25, 2003). The officials concluded that the earlyaccess proposed by the Alliance \"poi nts to an area of significant range of opinion within the patient and provider communitiesabout the standards that should be met before a drug ismarketed.\" Id. at 4. Although \"some members of the cancer community have suggested that [the] FDA needs to maintain astrong clinical trial system as th e basis of the approval of cancer drugs, . . . others, like [the Allia nce], have criticized [the FDA] for relying too heavily on completing certain trials beforeapproval.\" Id. The FDA noted that \"[i] n the realm of reviewing medical products to treat serious and life-threatening diseases,there is inevitable tension betw een early availability of products to patients, especially patients with refractory disease, and theneed to obtain sufficient data to provide a reasonableexpectation of benefit and lack of excessive harm.\" Id.9 Relying upon its experience exercising its scientific and medical judgment in creating its regulations for experimentaldrugs and, in certain circumstances, exceptions to thoseregulations for the terminally ill, the FDA noted that \"areasonably precise estimate of response rate\" and \"enoughexperience to detect serious adverse effects\" are \"critical\" indetermining when experimental drugs should be made available.Id. For example, most experimental cancer drugs \"have potentially lethal toxicity, with potentially large effects on apatient's remaining quality of life.\" Id. Accordingly, \"it does not serve patients well to make drugs too widely availablebefore there is a reasonable assessment of such risks to guidepatient decisions, and experience in managing them.\" Id. at 4-5. The FDA concluded that accepting the Alliance's proposal\"would upset the appropriate balance that [it is] seeking tomaintain, by giving almost total weight to the goal of earlyavailability and giving little recognition to the importance ofmarketing drugs with reasonable knowledge for patients andphysicians of their likely clinical benefit and their toxicity.\" Id. at 5. Having thus been rejected by the FDA, the Alliance turned to the courts, arguing that the United States Constitutionprovides a right of access to experimental drugs for its members.In a complaint that mirrored much of its earlier submissions tothe FDA, the Alliance argued that the FDA's lengthy clinicaltrials, combined with the \"FDA's restrictions on pre-approvalavailability[,] amount to a death sentence for these [terminallyill] patients.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-17. Nor, the Alliance argues, are the FDA's exceptions to the clinical testing processsufficient to provide the terminally ill the access they needbecause they \"are small, when th ey exist at all,\" and the ban on profits prevents many drug sponsors from participating. Id. \u00b6 18. 10 \"Terminally ill patients,\" in the Alliance's view, \"are typically willing to assume risks . . . .\" Id. \u00b6 19. Before the district court, the Allian ce argued that the Constitution guarantees them the right to do so. The district court rejectedthat argument, holding that \"the re is no constitutional right of access to unapproved drugs.\" Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. McClellan , No. 03-1601, 2004 WL 3777340, at *1 (D.D.C. Aug. 30, 2004). A divided panel of this Court reversed, concluding that \"where there are no alternativegovernment-approved treatment options, a terminally ill,mentally competent adult patient's informed access topotentially life-saving investigational new drugs determined bythe FDA after Phase I trials to be sufficiently safe for expanded human trials warrants protection under the Due Process Clause.\" Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v.von Eschenbach , 445 F.3d 470, 486 (D.C. Cir. 2006). We vacated that decision and granted rehearing en banc . See Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v.von Eschenbach , No. 04-5350 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 21, 2006). As framed by the Alliance, we now consider: Whether the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause embraces the right of a terminally illpatient with no remaining approved treatmentoptions to decide, in consultation with his or herown doctor, whether to seek access toinvestigational medications that the [FDA]concedes are safe and promising enough forsubstantial human testing.11 5 The dissent has recast the Alliance's proposed right away from the terms used in its briefs and oral argument\u2014a right to accessinvestigational new drugs\u2014into a right \"to try to save one's life,\"which has \"its textual anchor in th e right to life [expressed in the Fifth Amendment].\" Dissent at 2-3. Regardless of how it is described, wemust examine the proposed right under Glucksberg , which specifically cautions against the type of broad generalization the dissent nowemploys. See Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 721 (requiring a description' of the asserted fundamental liberty interest\"). If theasserted right is so broad that it protects a person's efforts to save hislife, it might subject to strict scrutiny any government action thatwould affect the means by which he sought to do so, no matter howremote the chance of success. The Supreme Court rejected a similarattempt to broadly define the right at issue in Reno v. Flores when it refused to accept the petitioner's definition as the \"freedom fromphysical restraint\" and instead cast the right as the \"right of a childwho has no available parent, close re lative, or legal guardian, and for whom the government is responsible, to be placed in the custody of awilling-and-able private custodian rather than of agovernment-operated or government-selected child-care institution.\"Reno v. Flores , 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993). The dissent suffers from the same flaw in arguing that this is about the right to save one's life,because, in the end, this case is about the right to access experimental and unproven drugs in an attemp t to save one's life, which we conclude under Glucksberg is not deeply rooted in our Nation's history and traditions. By describing too broadly at the outset aproposed right that will cover the Alliance's more narrow claim, thedissent fails Glucksberg 's threshold requirement of a carefully described right. We need not pursue the arguments that follow thatinitial misstep.Appellants' Br. at 1.5 That is, we must determine whether terminally ill patients have a fundamental right to experimentaldrugs that have passed Phase I clinical testing. If such a rightexists, the Alliance argues that both 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.34(b)(3)(preventing access to experimental drugs for terminally illpatients where there is insuffici ent evidence of effectiveness or12 where there is an unreasonable risk of injury) and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.7 (prohibiting drug manufacturers from profiting on thesale of experimental drugs) must be subjected to strict scrutiny because they interfere with a fundamental constitutional right.We do not address the broader question of whether access tomedicine might ever implicate fundamental rights. II. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that \"[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. CONST . amend. V. The Supreme Court has held that the protections of theAmendment \"guarantee[] more than fair process.\" Glucksberg , 521 U.S. The Court has stated that \"[t]he Clause . . .provides heightened protection against government interferencewith certain fundamental rights and liberty interests,\" id. at 720 (citing Reno v. Flores , 507 U.S. 292, 301-02 (1993); Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992)), including \"the rights to marry, to have children, to direct theeducation and upbringing of one's children, to marital privacy, to use contraception, to bodily integrity, and to abortion,\"Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 720 (citations omitted). As such rights are not set forth in the language of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has cautioned againstexpanding the substantive rights protected by the Due ProcessClause \"because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking inthis unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.\" Collins v. Harker Heights , 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992) (citing Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing , 474 U.S. 214, 225-26 (1985)) . There is an additional and substantial concern that courts must alsoconsider: \"By extending constitutional protection to an assertedright or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matteroutside the arena of public debate and legislative action.\"13 Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 720. Thus, the Supreme Court has directed courts to \"exercise the utmost care whenever we areasked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policypreferences of the [courts' members].\" Id. (quotation marks and citations omitted); see Moore , 431 U.S. at 502 (\"As the history of the Lochner era demonstrates, there is reason for concern lest the only limits to such judici al intervention become the predilections of those who happe n at the time to be Members of this Court.\") (footnote omitted). In Glucksberg , the Supreme Court described 521 U.S. at 720. First, we have regularly observed that the Due Process Clause specially protects thosefundamental rights and liberties which are,objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation's historyand tradition and implicit in the concept ofordered liberty, such that neither liberty norjustice would exist if they were sacrificed.Second, we have required insubstantive-due-process cases a carefuldescription of the asserted fundamental libertyinterest. Id. at 720-21 (quotation marks and citations omitted). We will assume arguendo that the Alliance's description of its asserted right would satisfy Glucksberg 's \"careful14 6 We nonetheless have serious doubt about whether the Alliance's description of its proposed constitutional right could ever pass constitutional muster. The Alliance's claimed right depends ona regulatory determination that the drug is safe for testing, promptingan obvious question: How can a constitutional right be defined by anadministrative regulation that is s ubject to change? Would an FDA decision requiring increased testing for safety and efficacy before thecommencement of human clinical trials affect the Alliance'sconstitutional right? Moreover, we find it difficult to imagine how aright inextricably entangled with the details of shifting administrativeregulations could be \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history andtradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 721 (quotation marks and citations omitted).description\" requirement.6 Looking to whether the Alliance has demonstrated that its right is deeply rooted in this Nation'shistory, tradition, and practices, the Alliance's claim forconstitutional protection rests on two arguments: (1) that\"common law and historical American practices havetraditionally trusted individual doctors and their patients withalmost complete autonomy to evaluate the efficacy of medicaltreatments\"; and (2) that FDA policy is \"inconsistent with theway that our legal tradition treats persons in all other life-threatening situations.\" Appellants' Br. at 31. Morespecifically, the Alliance argues that the concepts of self-defense, necessity, and interference with rescue are broadenough to demonstrate the existence of the fundamental rightthey seek\u2014a right for \"persons in mortal peril\" to \"try to savetheir own lives, even if the ch osen means would otherwise be illegal or involve enormous risks.\" Id. at 32. A. \"We begin, as we do in all due process cases, by examining our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices.\"15 Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 710. The Alliance argues that its right can be found in our history and legal traditions because \"thegovernment never interfered with the judgment of individual doctors about the medical efficacy of particular drugs until 1962,\" i.e., when major amendments were made to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Appellants' Br. at 44 (emphasisadded); see id. at 23 (\"[T]he common law consistently left judgments about the efficacy of medical treatments in the hands of individual doctors and their patients. Governmental reviewof the effectiveness of drugs did not exist in this country at all until 1962 . . . .\") (emphasis added). The Alliance has little to say, however, about our Nation's history of regulating the safety of drugs. The Alliance's effort to focus on efficacy regulation ignores one simple fact: it isunlawful for the Alliance to procure experimental drugs not onlybecause they have not been proven effective, but because theyhave not been proven safe. A lthough the Alliance contends that it only wants drugs that \"are safe and promising enough forsubstantial human testing,\" id. at 1, i.e., drugs that have passed Phase I testing, current law bans access to an experimental drug on safety grounds until it has successfully completed all phasesof testing. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21(b) (requiring that Phase II studies examine \" common short-term side effects and risks \" of new drugs) (emphasis added); id. \u00a7 312.21(c) (requiring Phase III studies to \"gather . . . additional information abouteffectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug\") (emphasis added). Thus, to succeed on its claim of a funda mental right of access for the terminally ill to experimental drugs, the Alliance must show not only that there is a tradition of access to drugs that have not yetbeen proven effective, but also a tradition of access to drugs that have not yet been proven safe.16 7 Drug regulation also has a long history in England, beginning no later than Henry VI's royal decree in 1447 that gavegrocers the power to inspect \"anis, wormseed, rhubarb, scammony,spikenard, senna and all sort of drugs belonging to medicine, so as not,in the buying of these to be hurt in their bodily health.\" E DWARD KREMERS , KREMERS AND URDANG 'S HISTORY OF PHARMACY 111 (4th ed. 1976). The Pharmacy Wares Drugs and Stuffs Act in 1540allowed inspectors to search apothecaries' [ i.e., pharmacists'] shops for drugs that were \"defective, corrupted and not meet nor convenientto be ministered in any medicines for the health of man's body.\" John P. Griffin, Venetian Treacle and the Foundation of Medicines Regulation , 58 B RIT. J. OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 317, 319 (2004); see also John P. Griffin & Rashmi R. Shah, History of Drug Regulation in the United Kingdom , in THE TEXTBOOK OF PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE 457 (John P. Griffin & John O'Grady eds., 2006). \"[W]hen the Society of Apothecaries was charteredindependently ([in] 1617), its master and wardens were empowered toinspect any pharmacy and to burn before the offender's door all drugsand preparations they deemed corrupt or unwholesome.\" K REMERS , supra , at 111. \"In the 18th century, power to examine the shops of apothecaries, chemists and druggists was given to the College ofPhysicians ([in] 1723), and cases involving questionable drugs werejudged by a court composed partly of physicians and partly ofapothecaries ([in] 1730).\" Id. at 111-12.Examining, as we are required to do under Glucksberg , our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practice with respect to theregulation of drugs for efficacy a nd safety, we conclude that our Nation has long expressed interest in drug regulation, calibrating its response in terms of the capabilities to determine the risksassociated with both drug safety and efficacy. Drug regulation in the United States 7 began with the Colonies and States when the Colony of Virginia's legislaturepassed an act in 1736 that addressed the dispensing of moredrugs than was \"necessary or useful\" because that practice had17 8 Although not an example of legislative or regulatory intervention, in 1630 Nicholas Knopp of Massachusetts was \"finedfive pounds, or was whipped, for vending as a cure for scurvy 'a waterof no worth nor value,' which he 's olde att a very deare rate.'\" J AMES HARVEY YOUNG , THE TOADSTOOL MILLIONAIRES : A SOCIAL HISTORY OF PATENT MEDICINES IN AMERICA BEFORE FEDERAL REGULATION 16 (1961) (quoting Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England (Boston, 1853), I, 83). become \"dangerous and intolerable.\" E DWARD KREMERS , KREMERS AND URDANG 'S HISTORY OF PHARMACY 158 (4th ed. 1976).8 The Territory of Orleans (Louisiana) passed an act in 1808 requiring a diploma and an examination before permittingpharmacists to dispense drugs; L ouisiana also prohibited the sale of deteriorated drugs and restricted the sale of poisons. Id. at 182-84, 214; see David L. Cowen, The Development of State Pharmaceutical Law , P HARMACY IN HISTORY , Vol. 37 No. 2, 1995, at 54 (noting that the 1808 act prohibited the sale of drugs that were \"injured, moulded, di scomposed, or sophisticated\" and placed restrictions on the sale of \"any suspicious or dangerousremedy\"). South Carolina enact ed legislation in 1817 requiring pharmacists to obtain licenses, K REMERS , supra , at 184, 214, followed by Georgia in 1825 and Alabama in 1852, id. at 214. By 1870, at least twenty-five states or territories had statutesregulating adulteration (impure drugs), and a few others hadlaws addressing poisons. Id. at 216. In the early history of our Nation, we observe not a tradition of protecting a right of access to drugs, but rather governments responding to the risks of newcompounds as they become aware of and able to address thoserisks. See Cowen, supra , at 56 (\"The history of state laws pertaining to pharmacy obviously reflect[s] the development of pharmacy scientifically, professionally, and economically.\"). Nor were the States the only regulators of access to drugs. Although early federal regulation was not extensive, perhaps18 9 As the Alliance notes, \"the Supreme Court held that the 1906 Act did not prohibit a drug manufacturer from marketing anineffective cancer remedy with false therapeutic claims, so long as itwas not adulterated.\" Appellants' Br. at 45 (citing United States v.

Congress followed with the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906,which prohibited the manufacture of any drug that was\"adulterated or misbranded.\" The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906, ch. 3915, 34 Stat. 768 (1906). 919 recognition of a constitutional right to access experimental drugs or consume any drugs regardless of the risks. 10 Looking to Lawrence v. Texas , the FDA argues that \"[t]he history of the FDCA over the past seventy years is entitled toparticular weight in the substantive due process calculus,\" Appellees'Br. at 31, because, in determining the constitutionality of a Texasstatute prohibiting certain intimate sexual conduct between membersof the same sex, the Supreme Court looked to the Nation's \"laws and traditions in the past half century \" as having the \"most relevance\" to the constitutional dispute in that case. Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U.S.The current regime of federal drug regulation began to take shape with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. See Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040 (1938) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq. ). The Act required that drug manufacturers provide proof thattheir products were safe before they could be marketed. See id. The new Act also prohibited false therapeutic claims. Id. Notably, the drug industry \"strenuously objected\" to the 1938Act \"ostensibly on the ground that it would deprive theAmerican people of the righ t to self-medication,\" H ARRY A. TOULMIN , JR., LAW OF FOODS , DRUGS AND COSMETICS 8-9 (2d ed. 1963)\u2014an argument not unlike the Alliance's position oftoday. We end our historical analysis where the Alliance would prefer it begin\u2014with the 1962 Amendments to the FDCA.Undoubtedly, as the Alliance argues at length, Congressamended the FDCA in 1962 to explicitly require that the FDAonly approve drugs deemed effective for public use. See Drug Amendments of 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-781, \u00a7 102, 76 Stat. 780,781 (1962). Thus, the Alliance argues that, prior to 1962,patients were free to make their own decisions whether a drugmight be effective. 10 But even assuming arguendo that efficacy20 558, 571-72 (2003) (emphasis added). We need not determine today whether recent history is particularly relevant in measuring the scopeof rights under the Due Process Clause. In this case, there is noevidence of a deeply rooted right of terminally ill patients to gainaccess to experimental drugs\u2014either throughout our Nation's historyor during the past half century. 11 In fact, the FDA cites numerous examples in which drugs have been pulled from the market post-Phase I due to safety concerns.See, e.g. , Alex Berenson, End of Drug Trial Is a Big Loss for Pfizer and Heart Patients , N.Y. TIMES , Dec. 4, 2006, at A1 (highlighting Pfizer's decision to pull torcetrapib from a clinical trial of more than15,000 patients because those taking the drug were dying at a greaterrate than those taking a placebo); Milton Packer et al., Effect of Oral Milrinone on Mortality in Severe Chronic Heart Failure , 325 NEW ENG. J. MED. 1468 (1991) (concluding after expanded clinical trials that milrinone therapy was \"associated with a 28 percent increase inmortality\"); Debra S. Echt et al., Mortality and Morbidity in Patients Receiving Encainide, Flecainide, or Placebo , 324 NEW ENG. J. MED. 781 (1991) (concluding after expanded clinical trials that \"[t]here was an excess of deaths . . . in patients treated with encainide orflecainide\"). regulation began in 1962, the Alliance's argument ignores our Nation's history of drug safety regulation described above. Nor can the Alliance override current FDA regulations simply byinsisting that drugs which have completed Phase I testing aresafe enough for terminally ill patients. Current law bars publicaccess to drugs undergoing clinical testing on safety grounds.The fact that a drug has emerged from Phase I with adetermination that it is safe for limited clinical testing in acontrolled and closely-monitored environment after detailedscrutiny of each trial participant does not mean that a drug issafe for use beyond supervised trials. 11 FDA regulation of post- Phase I drugs is entirely consiste nt with our historical tradition of prohibiting the sale of unsafe drugs. 21 12 In exercising the caution the Supreme Court demands when analyzing claims of fundamental rights, see Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 720, we note a more plausible explanation for the limited efficacyregulation\u2014the government was not previously able to systematicallyregulate effectively for efficacy: \"The history of the effectivenessrequirement in drug regulation is in extricably linked to the advent of the randomized, controlled clinical trial as the cornerstone of medicalresearch . . . , [which] century.\" Jennifer Kulynych, Will FDA Relinquish the New Drug Appr oval? Redefining \"Substantial Evidence\" in the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 , 54 F OOD & DRUG L.J. 127, 131 (1999) (footnotes omitted). In fact, \"World War II ushered in the era of the modern clinical trial, when the U.S. militaryundertook large-scale, systematic testing of tuberculosis remedies andantimalarial agents on groups of enlisted soldiers.\" Id. Ironically, the Alliance would use the recent development of tools such as modernclinical trials to bolster its claim of exemption from regulation madepossible by these very tools. It was not just advances in statistics and clinical trials, however, that improved governments' ability to regulate access todrugs. The ability of scientists to \"detect, identify, and understand\" the components of various drugs has contributed to \"new regulatoryBut even setting the safety issu e to one side, the Alliance's argument that effectiveness was not required before 1962 alsofails under closer scrutiny. First, as a matter of history, at least some drug regulation prior to 1962 addressed efficacy. Moreimportantly, an arguably limited history of efficacy regulationprior to 1962 does not establish a fundamental right of access to unproven drugs. The amendments made to the FDCA byCongress throughout the twentieth century demonstrate thatCongress and the FDA have con tinually responded to new risks presented by an evolving technology. Recent governmentefficacy regulation has reflected Congress's exercise of its well- established power to regulate in response to scientific,mathematical, and medical advances. 12 22 approaches [that] would not have been feasible and could never have occurred\" without these scientific advances. Peter Barton Hutt, The Importance of Analytical Chemistry to Food and Drug Regulation , 38 VAND. L. REV. 479, 487 (1985). Further, the need for efficacy regulation became more pressing \"[a]fter World War II [as] thenumber of drugs available, the range of diseases and conditionsamenable to drug therapy, and the power of drugs all increaseddramatically.\" P ETER TEMIN , TAKING YOUR MEDICINE : DRUG REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES 5 (1980). True, a lack of government interference throughout history might be some evidence that a right is deeply rooted. Butstanding alone, it cannot be enough. If it were, it would be easy to employ such a premise to support sweeping claims offundamental rights. For example, one might argue that, because Congress did not significantly regulate marijuana until 1937,relatively late in the constitutional day, see Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 11 (2005), there must be a tradition of protectingmarijuana use. Because Congress did not regulate narcoticsuntil 1866 when it heavily taxe d opium, a drug created long before our Nation's founding, see United States v. Moore , 486 F.2d 1139, 1215-16, 1218 n.50 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (Wright, J.,dissenting), it must be that individuals have a right to acquireand use narcotics free from regulation. Or because speed limitsare a recent innovation, we have a fundamental right to drive asfast as we deem fit. But this is most certainly not the law. A prior lack of regulation suggests that we must exercise care inevaluating the untested assertion of a constitutional right to befree from new regulation. But the lack of prior governmental regulation of an activity tells us little about whether the activity merits constitutional protection: \"The fact that powers longhave been unexercised well may call for close scrutiny as towhether they exist; but if granted, they are not lost by beingallowed to lie dormant, any more than nonexistent powers canbe prescripted by an unchallenged exercise.\" See United States23 13 The Supreme Court in Glucksberg specifically disapproved of recognizing new fundamental rights solely based upon \"abstractconcepts of personal autonomy.\" Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 725. The FDA argues that the Alliance's e ffort to create a new fundamental right based upon these three doctrines amounts to precisely this typeof reasoning forbidden by Glucksberg , that is, amounts to the creation of a right based solely upon abstract concepts of liberty. The Allianceinsists that \"reasoning by analogy, and a search for broader principles,are the only available tools\" in cases where there is a \"tradition of non-regulation.\" Reply Br. at 3. In those circumstances, the Allianceargues, \"there often will be no common law cases precisely on pointv. Morton Salt Co. , 338 U.S. 632, 647 (1950). Indeed, creating constitutional rights to be free fr om regulation based solely upon a prior lack of regulation woul d undermine much of the modern administrative state, which, like drug regulation, has increasedin scope as changing conditions have warranted. B. The Alliance next turns to several common law doctrines, arguing that barring access to experimental drugs for terminallyill patients is \"inconsistent with the way that our legal traditiontreats persons in all other life-threatening situations.\"Appellants' Br. at 31. Speci fically, the Alliance argues that three doctrines\u2014(1) the doctrine of necessity; (2) the tort of intentional interference with resc ue; and (3) the right to self- defense\u2014each support the recognition of a right to self-preservation. Such a right to self-preservation, the Alliancebelieves, would permit \"persons in mortal peril . . . to try to save their own lives, even if the c hosen means would otherwise be illegal or involve enormous risks.\" Id. at 32. Specifically, in this case, the Alliance believes that a right to self-preservationwould give the terminally ill a constitutionally protected right ofaccess to experimental drugs. 13 24 simply because the common law never confronted the precise problem.\" Id. We need not address this FDA argument because none of the common law doctrines upon which the Alliance relies supportsits proposed right. 14 As an initial matter, the Oakland Court noted that \"it is an open question whether federal courts ever have authority to recognize a necessity defense not provided by statute.\" Id. (emphasis added). \"Even at common law, the defense of necessity was somewhatcontroversial. And under our cons titutional system, in which federal crimes are defined by statute rather than by common law, it isespecially so.\" Id. (internal citations omitted). The Court did \"not decide, however, whether necessity can ever be a defense when the federal statute does not expressly provide for it,\" Oakland , 532 U.S. at 491, because, as in this case, th e federal statute at issue in OaklandLooking first to the Alliance's necessity argument, the Alliance i nvokes the comm on law doctrine, which \"'traditionally covered the situation where physical forcesbeyond the actor's control rendered illegal conduct the lesser oftwo evils.'\" United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative , 532 U.S. 483, 490 (2001) (quoting United States v. Bailey , 444 U.S. 394, 410 (1980)). The Alliance offers, however, little detail about how necessity would apply to itscase. See Appellants' Br. at 37. ( E.g., would terminally ill patients have a right to force drug companies to provide themwith experimental drugs?) Nonetheless, the Supreme Court'sanalysis of the common law doctrine of necessity in Oakland leaves little room for the Allia nce's argument that common law necessity could justify overriding the Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct. In Oakland , a group of patients seeking access to marijuana for medicinal purposes argued that \"because necessity was adefense at common law, medical necessity should be read intothe Controlled Substances Act.\" Oakland , 532 U.S. at 490. 1425 had specifically reached the value judgment the proponents of an implied necessity defense sought to override. 15 The lynchpin of the dissent's argument that preventing access to experimental drugs implicates a right to preserve one's ownlife is that we have confused \"what is necessary with what issufficient.\" Dissent at 3, 9. Because terminally ill patients have noother approved treatment options, so the argument goes, any drugThe Supreme Court rejected that argument because \"[u]nder any conception of legal necessity, one principle is clear: The defense cannot succeed when the legislature itself has made adetermination of values,\" id. at 491 (quotation marks omitted). Although the Court limited its analys is to the statutory issue and did not address the defendant's constitutional arguments, see id. at 494, the learning of Oakland is clear. Congress may limit or even eliminate a necessity defense that might otherwise beavailable. That is precisely what the FDCA has done. Congress has prohibited general access to experimental drugs, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a), and has prescribed in detail how experimentaldrugs may be studied and used by the scientific and medicalcommunities, see id. \u00a7 355(i). Given the Supreme Court's conclusion that the common law defense of necessity remainscontroversial and cannot override a value judgment alreadydetermined by the legislature, the common law doctrine ofnecessity provides little support to the Alliance's proposed right. The Alliance next invokes the tort of intentional interference with lifesaving efforts, which the Restatement ofTorts defines as \"intentionally prevent[ing] a third person fromgiving to another aid necessary to his bodily security.\" R ESTATEMENT (FIRST) OF TORTS \u00a7 326 (emphasis added). But that is not this case. The Allia nce seeks access to drugs that are experimental and have not been shown to be safe, let aloneeffective at (or \"necessary\" for) prolonging life. 15 Indeed, the26 having passed Phase I, no matter the remaining unexplored risk, is \"necessary\" for prolonging a patient's life. But the dissent ignores thefact that when these treatment deci sions are being made, the safety and efficacy records of experimental drugs are not fully known. We thuscannot know until after the clinical testing process has been completedthat these drugs are in fact necessary. This argument also defiesreality as the great majority of experimental drugs ultimately provideno benefit, and we fail to see how an ineffective and unsafe drug canbe classified as necessary. See, e.g. , Peter D. Jacobson & Wendy E. Parmet, A New Era of Unapproved Drugs: The Case of Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach , 297 JAMA 205, 206 (2007) (noting that only five percent of all cancer drugs beginning clinical trials areultimately approved for use and that less than a third that pass Phase I advance from Phase II to Phase III). The dissent's position is furthercompromised by the fact that the Supreme Court rejected a similarargument in a statutory challenge to the FDCA because \"[f]or theterminally ill, as for anyone else, a drug is unsafe if its potential forinflicting death or physical injury is not offset by the possibility oftherapeutic benefit.\" United States v. Rutherford , 442 U.S. 544, 555-56 (1979).Alliance concedes that taking experimental drugs can \"involve enormous risks.\" Appellants' Br. at 32. In essence, the Alliance insists on a constitutional right to assume any level of risk. It isdifficult to see how a tort addressing interference with providing\"necessary\" aid would guarantee a constitutional right tooverride the collective judgment of the scientific and medicalcommunities expressed through the FDA's clinical testingprocess. Thus, we cannot agree that the tort of intentionalinterference with rescue evidences a right of access toexperimental drugs. Finally, the Alliance looks to traditional self-defense principles to support its proposed constitutional right. Thecommon law doctrine of self-defen se provides that \"[o]ne who is not the aggressor . . . is ju stified in using a reasonable amount27 16 See also Casey , 505 U.S. at 879 (reaffirming exception); Roe, 410 U.S. at 173 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\"If the Texas statute were to prohibit an abortion even where the mother's life is injeopardy, I have little doubt that such a statute would lack a rationalrelation to a valid state objective . . . .\").of force against his adversary when he reasonably believes (a) that he is in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from hisadversary and (b) that the use of such force is necessary to avoidthis danger.\" 2 W AYNE R. LAFAVE, SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW \u00a7 10.4 (2d ed. 2003). Self-defense typically arises when a victim is being attacked by an aggressor and uses reasonableforce to overcome immediate danger. The Alliance argues thatself-defense permits victims to assume two types of risk: (1) therisk that the victim will kill th e attacker; and (2) the risk that \"[f]ighting back may dramatically increase the . . . harm\" to the victim. Appellants' Br. at 35-36. So, the argument goes, ifvictims of crimes are allowed to assume these risks in defendingtheir lives, terminally ill patients should also be allowed toassume the risk that an experimental drug may hasten theirdeaths. That self-defense principles should be applied in the medical context is evidence d, the Alliance argues, by the Supreme Court's abortion jurisp rudence. The Alliance does not look to the \"right of personal privacy\" addressed in Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113, 152 (1973). Instead, the Alliance argues that Roe \"recognized another, entirely separate right to abortion: a woman's right to abort a fetus at any stage of a pregnancy if doing so is necessary to preserve her life or health.\" Appellants' Br. at 39 (emphasis in original). 16 \"That right,\" the Alliance argues, \"is grounded in traditional self-defense principles rather than privacy . . . .\" Id. Applying that concept here, the Alliance argues that because its terminally ill members are in immediatedanger of harm from cancer, they can use whatever medical28 17 To be sure, we do not suggest that the law can never strike the balance between access to experimental drugs and risk that theAlliance suggests. We limit our analysis to whether the Constitutiondemands the balance they desire. The Alliance can, of course, advocate its position vigorously before Congress and the FDA, andconvince our Nation's democratic branches that the values theAlliance favors should be protected. In fact, within the last year, thepolitical branches have responded to the concerns of the Alliance andothers. The FDA recently issued a notice of proposed rulemakingthat: propos[ed] to amend its regulations on access to investigational new drugs for the treatment ofmeans are necessary to defend themselves. Thus, they argue, even if a medical treatment might otherwise be prohibited bylaw, the doctrine of self-def ense justifies access to that treatment, just as self-defense ju stifies an assault victim using physical force otherwise prohibited by law. This analogy also fails because this case is not about using reasonable force to defend oneself (as in most cases involvingself-defense), nor is it about access to life-saving medicaltreatment. This case is about whether there is a constitutionalright to assume, in the Alliance' s own words, \"enormous risks,\" Appellants' Br. at 32, in pursuit of potentially life-saving drugs. Unlike the cases in which the doctrine of self-defense mightproperly be invoked, this case involves risk from drugs with noproven therapeutic effect, which at a minimum separates thisexample from the abortion \"life of the mother\" exception.Because terminally ill patients cannot fairly be characterized asusing reasonable force to defend themselves when they takeunproven and possibly unsafe drugs, the Alliance's desire thatthe terminally ill be free to assume the risk of experimentaldrugs cannot draw support from the doctrine of self-defense. 1729 patients. The proposed rule would clarify existing regulations and add new types of expanded access fortreatment use. Under the proposal, expanded accessto investigational drugs for treatment use would beavailable to individual patients, including inemergencies; intermediate-size patient populations;and larger populations under a treatment protocol ortreatment investigational new drug application (IND). The proposed rule is intended to improve access toinvestigational drugs for patients with serious orimmediately life-threatening diseases or conditions,who lack other therapeutic options and who maybenefit from such therapies. Expanded Access to Investigationa l Drugs, 71 Fed. Reg. 75,147-01, 75,147 (Dec. 14, 2006).III. Although it has not addressed the precise constitutional argument urged by the Alliance, we find it highly significant that the Supreme Court has rejected several similar challenges to theFDCA and related laws br ought on statutory grounds. See, e.g. , Raich , 545 U.S. at 28 (\"the dispen sing of new drugs, even when doctors approve their use, must await federal approval\"); United States v. Rutherford , 442 U.S. 544, 552 (1979) (\"we are persuaded by the legislativ e history and consistent administrative interpretation of the [FDCA] that no implicitexemption for drugs used by the terminally ill is necessary toattain congressional objectives\"); cf. Oakland , 532 U.S. at 490 (with respect to whether there is an implied \"medical necessity\"exemption to prosecution for marijuana use under the ControlledSubstances Act, generally speaking, \"[w]hether, as a policymatter, an exemption should be created is a question forlegislative judgment, not judicial inference\") (quotation marksomitted). And other courts have rejected arguments that the30 18 No circuit court has acceded to an affirmative access claim. See, e.g. , Mitchell v. Clayton , 995 F.2d 772, 775 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"most federal courts have held that a patient does not have a constitutional right to obtain a particular type of treatment or to obtaintreatment from a particular provider if the government has reasonablyprohibited that type of treatment or provider\"); N.Y. State Ophthalmological Soc'y v. Bowen , 854 F.2d 1379, 1389 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (\"We disagree that the constitutional right to privacycomprehensively protects all choices made by patients and theirphysicians or subjects to 'strict scrutiny' all government interferencewith choice of medical treatment.

There is perhaps no profession more properly open to suchregulation than that which embraces the practitioners of medicine.\"). 19 As there exists no deeply rooted right, we need not examine whether a right of access to experimental drugs is \"'implicit in theconcept of ordered liberty,' such that 'neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.'\" Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 720-21 (quoting Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U.S. 319, 325, 326 (1937)). While we need not and do not address all of the Alliance's argumentsregarding whether their proposed right is implicit in our Nation'ssystem of ordered liberty, we note a crucial difference between thiscase and one of the cases relied upon by the Alliance in making thatIn keeping with those decisions, we conclude that the Alliance has not provided evidence of a right to procure and use experimental drugs that is deeply rooted in our Nation's history and traditions. To the contrar y, our Nation's history evidences increasing regulation of drugs as both the ability of government to address these risks has increased and the risks associated withdrugs have become apparent. Similarly, our legal traditions ofallowing a necessity defense, prohibiting intentional interferencewith rescue, and recognizing a right of self-defense cannotjustify creating a constitutional right to assume any level of riskwithout regard to the scientific and medical judgment expressedthrough the clinical testing process. 19 32 argument, Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dep't of Health , 497 U.S. 261 (1990) . In Cruzan , the Supreme Court \"assume[d] that the United States Constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition,\" althoughthe Court indicated that \"the dramatic consequences involved in [aparticular] refusal of [life-sustaining] treatment would inform theinquiry as to whether the deprivation of that interest is constitutionallypermissible.\" Id. at 279. Looking to Cruzan , the Alliance argues that \"[i]f a patient has a fundamental ri ght to medical self-determination that gives them the right to starve themselves to death, then surely they have a right to choose to fight for their lives even if that means takinga drug that has not yet met the FDA's full approval standards.\"Appellants' Br. at 27. Cruzan 's assumption that there is a right to refuse lifesaving treatment in some circumstances was predicated upon\"the common-law rule that forced medication was a battery[] and thelong legal tradition protecting the decision to refuse unwanted medicaltreatment.\" Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 725 (discussing also Cruzan , 497 U.S. at 269. But a tradition protecting individual freedom from life-saving, but forced, medical treatment does not evidence aconstitutional tradition of providing affirmative access to a potentially harmful, and even fatal, commercial good. IV. Because the Alliance's claimed right is not fundamental, the Alliance's claim of a right of access to experimental drugsis subject only to rational basis scrutiny. See Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 722 (noting that \"a challenged state action [must]implicate a fundamental right\" to avoid rational basis review).The rational basis test requires th at the Alliance prove that the government's restrictions bear no rational relationship to alegitimate state interest. See, e.g. , Harrah Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Martin , 440 U.S. 194, 198 (1979); Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 735. The challenged policy \"need not be in every respect logicallyconsistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is enough thatthere is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be33 20 We are mindful of the fact that this case is before us pursuant to the FDA's motion to dismiss, brought under Federal Ruleof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The Seventh Circuit has noted sometension between the Rule 12(b)(6) st andard and rational basis review. See Wroblewski v. City of Washburn , 965 F.2d 452, 459 (7th Cir. 1992) (\"The rational basis standard requires the government to win ifany set of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify itsclassification; the Rule 12(b)(6) standard requires the plaintiff toprevail if relief could be granted under any set of facts that could beproved consistent with the allegati ons. The rational basis standard, of course, cannot defeat the plaintiff's benefit of the broad Rule 12(b)(6)standard.\") (quotation marks and citations omitted). In this case, however, we need not worry about the outer realm of Rule 12(b)(6)protection because, as we explain below, the Alliance's pleadingsthemselves make our rational basis determination straightforward. Cf. Trudeau v. FTC , 456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (noting that it \"is possible for a plaintiff to plead too much: that is, to plead himself outof court by alleging facts that render success on the merits impossible\"(quoting Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc. , 216 F.3d 1111, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2000))).thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc. , 348 U.S. 483, 487-88 (1955).20 The Alliance acknowledges the risk inherent in taking experimental drugs. See Am. Compl. \u00b6 19 (\"Terminally ill patients are typically willing to assume risks . . . .\"). The Alliance would rather that individual patients make decisionsabout this risk than have the FDA decide which drugs are safeenough for limited access to the terminally ill. The FDAcounters that \"[w]ithout a requirement of FDA approval, patientscould be exposed to unreasonable risks from investigationaldrugs that may be neither safe nor effective.\" Appellees' Br. at 55-56.34 Applying the rational basis standard to the Alliance's complaint, we cannot say that the government's interest does notbear a rational relation to a legitimate state interest. Thatconclusion is compelled by the Supreme Court's decision inUnited States v. Rutherford , 442 U.S. 544 (1979). In that case, terminally ill patients sought to prevent the FDA fromprohibiting access to the drug laetrile, even though the drug hadnot been approved for public use. In rejecting a challenge byterminally ill patients clai ming that the FDCA's safety requirement did not apply to them, the Supreme Court held that\"[f]or the terminally ill, as for anyone else, a drug is unsafe if its potential for inflicting death or physical injury is not offset bythe possibility of therapeutic benefit.\" Id. at 555-56; see also id. at 558 (noting that history has demonstrated that numerous\"resourceful entrepreneurs\" might try to take advantage of anunregulated market, which \"suggest[s] why Congress couldreasonably have determined to protect the terminally ill, no lessthan other patients, from the vast range of self-styled panaceasthat inventive minds can devise\"). Although terminally ill patients desperately need curative treatments, as Rutherford holds, their deaths can certainly be hastened by the use of a potentially toxic drug with no proventherapeutic benefit. Thus, we must conclude that, prior todistribution of a drug outside of controlled studies, theGovernment has a rational basis for ensuring that there is ascientifically and medically acceptable level of knowledge about the risks and benefits of such a drug. We therefore hold that the FDA's policy of limiting access to investigational drugs is rationally related to the legitimate state interest of protectingpatients, including the terminally ill, from potentially unsafedrugs with unknown therapeutic effects. Although in the Alliance's view the FDA has unjustly erred on the side of safety in balancing the risks and benefits of35 experimental drugs, this is not to say that the FDA's balance can never be changed. The Alliance's arguments about morality,quality of life, and acceptable levels of medical risk are certainly ones that can be aired in the democratic branches, withoutinjecting the courts into unknown questions of science andmedicine. Our Nation's history and traditions have consistently demonstrated that the democratic branches are better suited todecide the proper balance between the uncertain risks andbenefits of medical technology, and are entitled to deference in doing so. As the Supreme Court has held: We must assume that, when the statute in question was passed, the legislature . . . was not unaware of these opposing theories, and was compelled, ofnecessity, to choose between them. It was notcompelled to commit a matter involving thepublic health and safety to the final decision of acourt or jury. It is no part of the function of acourt or a jury to determine which one of twomodes was likely to be the most effective for theprotection of the public against disease. Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11, 30 (1905); see also Gonzales v. Carhart , 127 S. Ct. 1610, 1636 (2007) (\"The Court has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to passlegislation in areas where there is medical and scientificuncertainty.\"); cf. Greenwood v. United States , 350 U.S. 366, 375-76 (1956) (\"The only certain thing that can be said aboutthe present state of knowledge and therapy . . . is that sciencehas not reached to Congre ss in dealing with a situation like this ought not to rest on dogm atic adherence to one view or another on controversial psychiatric issues.\"). Consistent withthat precedent, our holding today ensures that this debate amongthe Alliance, the FDA, the scie ntific and medical communities,36 and the public may continue through the democratic process. See Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 735. V. For the foregoing reasons, the j udgment of the district court is affirmed. So ordered.ROGERS , Circuit Judge , with whom Chief Judge GINSBURG joins, dissenting: Today, the court rejects the claim that terminally ill patients who have exhausted all government-approved treatment options have a fundamental right to accessinvestigational new drugs. The court's opinion reflects a flawed conception of the right claimed by the Abigail Alliance forBetter Access to Developmental Drugs and a stunningmisunderstanding of the stakes. The court shifts the inquiryrequired by Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 702 (1997), by changing the nature of the right, by conflating the right with the deprivation, and by prematurely advancing countervailinggovernment interests. The court fails to come to grips with theNation's history and traditions, which reflect deep respect andprotection for the right to preserve life, a corollary to the rightto life enshrined in the Constitu tion. The court confuses this liberty interest with the manne r in which the Alliance alleges that the liberty has been deprived, namely by denying terminallyill patients access to investigational medications under thenarrow conditions described by the Alliance. The courtconflates the inquiry as to whet her a fundamental right exists at all with whether the government has demonstrated a compellinginterest, when strictly scrutinized, rendering its restrictive policyconstitutional. These missteps lead the court to rely upon how rights and liberties have been limited and restricted \u2014 addressingregulations to prevent fraud in the sale of misbranded andadulterated medications or safety restrictions applicable to allmedicines for any palliative purpose \u2014 which says little aboutthe historic importance of the underlying right of a person tosave her own life. Likewise, in its treatment of the common law doctrines of necessity, interferen ce with rescue, and self defense, the court points to evolved limitations on those doctrines whileignoring the core concerns that animate them, namely the specialimportance of life and attempts to preserve it. That the ultimateprotection of such varying attempts to save life is cabined by the2 precedents \u2014 regarding what cons titutes \"necessity,\" the related \"necessity\" of any aid being given to a third party, and the\"reasonable\" and \"necessary\" limitations on any force used inself-defense \u2014 does not suggest the absence of an underlyingright to attempt to protect life, but rather the recognition ofcompeting governmental interests that in various circumstancesjustify the deprivation of or a limitation upon the right. The common law doctrines remain good evidence of a history and tradition of protecti ng life and attempts to preserve life as a deep-seated personal right. That the right may be andhas been denied in the face of compelling governmental interestsis no reason for conflating the two stages of the analysis andlooking only to the results of past cases in order to avoid theanalysis prescribed by the Supreme Court in Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 720-21. Contrary to toda y's view of the court and the Federal Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), nothing in the prioropinion of the court would give \"t otal weight\" to the interests of the terminal patients or deny the FDA the ability to put itscompeting governmental interests into the balance. The courtwas explicit on this point, requiri ng precisely such weighing and proof of the proposed government concerns, rather than merelyaccepting, under the rubric of rational basis scrutiny, anyassertions the FDA chooses to offer. See Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. von Eschenbach , 445 F.3d 470, 486 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\" Abigail Alliance I \") (vacated upon grant of rehearing en banc). In the end, it is startling that the oft-limited rights to marry, to fornicate, to have children, to control the education andupbringing of children, to perform varied sexual acts in private,and to control one's own body even if it results in one's owndeath or the death of a fetus ha ve all been deemed fundamental rights covered, although not always protected, by the DueProcess Clause, but the right to try to save one's life is left out3 in the cold despite its textual an chor in the right to life. This alone is reason the court should pause about refusing to put the FDA to its proof when it denies terminal patients with noalternative therapy the only opti on they have left, regardless of whether that option may be a long-shot with high risks. Thecourt is on even weaker foo ting when it relies upon the risks entailed in medical procedures to wrest life-and-death decisionsthat once were vested in patient s and their physicians. The court commits a logical error of dramatic consequence by concludingthat the investigational drugs are somehow not \"necessary.\" Op.at 25 & n.15; accord id. at 26. While the potential cures may not prove sufficient to save the life of a terminally ill patient, they are surely necessary if there is to be any possibility of preserving her life. It bears outlining the history and common law basis for the Alliance's claim in order to demonstrate, once again, that thehistory and traditions of this Nation support the right of aterminal patient, and not the government, to make thisfundamentally personal choice i nvolving her own life. Because judicial precedents and the historical record require strictscrutiny before upsetting rights of this magnitude, the FDA must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest before itspolicy restricting access can survive. Accordingly, I wouldremand the case to the district court to make the initialdetermination as to whether FDA has met its burden, and Irespectfully dissent. I. The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution proscribes the \"depriv[ation] of life, lib erty, or property.\" U.S. CONST . amend. V. The Alliance claims a corolla ry to the right to life itself, namely the right to attempt to preserve it. As alleged by theAlliance, this right is deprived without due process of law when4 1The Glucksberg framework arose from a situation involving a non-literal liberty interest. Although, as described below, the rightto act to preserve one's own life passes the test laid down in that case,the healthy skepticism that Glucksberg prescribed for new-fangled non-literal liberty interests may be unduly restrictive as applied to aclaim with a firm textual anchor in the right to life expressly protectedby the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.the FDA makes it practically impossible for Alliance members for whom conventional treatments have failed to accessinvestigational new drugs that have been approved forsubstantial human testing. Under Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 720- 21, a substantive due process right qualifies as fundamental if it is both \"'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,'\" id. at 721 (quoting Moore v. City of E. Cleveland , 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion)), and \"'implicit in the concept ofordered liberty,'\" id. (quoting Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937)). 1 If the Alliance has correctly alleged a fundamental right, then the FDA policy can survive only uponproof of a compelling government interest that overcomes theliberty interest. A. The Glucksberg analysis begins with a \"'careful description' of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.\" 521U.S. at 721-23. As the court's opi nion in this case demonstrates, the description of the right is of crucial importance \u2014 too broad and a right becomes all-encompassing and impossible toevaluate; too narrow and a right appears trivial. See Abigail Alliance I , 445 F.3d at 477. The court a sserts that \"[t]his case is about whether there is a constitutional right to assume . . .'enormous risks' in pursuit of potentially life-saving drugs.\" Op. at 28 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). Thisdescription can be characteri zed as \"careful\" only if the objective of Glucksberg analysis is to produce abstractions that5 2Similarly, the Tenth Circuit has held that although parents have a fundamental constitutional right to direct the education andupbringing of their children, this right does not \"allow parents todictate that their children will attend public school for only part of theschool day.\" Swanson ex rel. Swanson v. Guthrie Indep. Sch. Dist.shield a court from acknowledging the rights underlying a party's claims. As the court notes, fundamental rights cannot be \"solely based upon 'abstract concepts of personal autonomy.'\"Op. at 23 n.13 (quoting Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 725). However, were it impermissible to draw any inferences from a broaderright to a narrower right, nearly all of the Supreme Court'ssubstantive due process case law would be out of bounds. See, e.g., Moore , 431 U.S. at 503 (extrapolating specific right to determine extended family living arrangements from broaderconstitutional protection for \"the sanctity of the family\"); Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 (1973) (identifying specific right to terminate a pregnancy from broader right to privacy); Griswold v. Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479, 484-86 (1965) (inferring specific right to use contraception from general right to be free from intrusion into \"sacred precincts of marital bedrooms\"). In any event, the Alliance's liberty claims are not grounded in theabstract notion of personal autonomy but rather in the specificright to act to save one's own life. The court fundamentally misunderstands the right claimed by the Alliance and trivially cas ts it as a function of the regulatory scheme. See Op. at 14 n.6. But the Alliance should not be penalized for anticipating a justification for infringing theright that might survive strict scrutiny. Applying the court'sreasoning today, had \"Jane Roe\" been prescient enough to claima right to abort a pre-viable fetus by a procedure that isdemonstrably safer than all other alternatives, cf. Gonzales v. Carhart , 127 S. Ct. 1610, 1638 (2007), she would have failed to show a fundamental right to an abortion. 2 Again, the claimed6 No. I-L , 135 F.3d 694, 702 (10th Cir. 1998). By the court's reasoning, if parents had come to court claiming a fundamental right to educatetheir children but acknowledging that if they sent their children topublic school, they could do so only full-time, the fundamental rightnever would have been recognized. But see Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 (1923); Pierce v. Soc'y of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510 (1925).fundamental right is to attempt to preserve one's life; whether the risks associated with doing so justify restraining that right is properly considered only after the right is deemed fundamental.Under Glucksberg , the court's analysis should begin with an assessment of whether the right to attempt to preserve life can be found in the Nation's history and tradition. See Abigail Alliance I, 445 F.3d at 479. A review of this history demonstrates that this Nation has long entrusted in individuals thosefundamentally personal medical deci sions that lie at the core of personal autonomy, self-determination, and self-defense. 1. The heritage of this right predates the Founding. Samuel Adams referred to \"the duty of self preservation\" as \"the firstlaw of nature.\" Samuel Adams, The Rights of the Colonists: Report of the Committee of Correspondence to the Boston TownMeeting , 7 OLD SOUTH LEAFLETS 417 (No. 173) (Burt Franklin 1970) (1772). The common law's eminent commentator,William Blackstone, wrote of three \"principal or primaryarticles\" historically comprising \"the rights of all mankind.\"First among these was \"[t]he right of personal security . . . in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs,his body, [and] his health.\" W ILLIAM BLACKSTONE , 1 COMMENTARIES *129. Blackstone described the guarantee of \"[t]he preservation of a man's health from such practices as mayprejudice or annoy it.\" Id. at *134. This right included the right to self-defense and the right to self-preservation. \"For whatever is done by a man to save either life or member, is looked upon7 as done upon the highest necessity and compulsion.\" Id. at *130. This principle is of early vintage, for \"Anglo-American law starts with the premise of thorough-going self determination.\"Natanson v. Kline , 350 P.2d 1093, 1104 (Kan. 1960). Long before regulation of the efficacy of medications wascontemplated by the federal government, courts recognized with\"universal acquiescence\" that \"the free citizen's first andgreatest all others,\" is \"the right to theinviolability of his person, in othe r words, his right to himself.\" Pratt v. Davis , 118 Ill. App. 161, 166 (1905), aff'd , 79 N.E. 562 (Ill. 1906). So too, this court has recognized \"the concept,fundamental in American jurisprudence, that '[e]very humanbeing of adult years and sound mind has a right to determinewhat shall be done with his own body.'\" Canterbury v. Spence , 464 F.2d 772, 780 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (alteration in Schloendorff v. Soc'y of N.Y. Hosp. , 105 N.E. 92, 93 (1914) (Cardozo, J.)). 2. This historical entitlement recognized in the legal tradition of this Nation is re flected in rights recognized at common law that are retained by an individual. Most notably,the right of self-defense enfor ces the right of a person facing death to take reasonable steps to protect her own life. Although this right is not unqualified, self -defense has been described as \"an inherent right of man, olde r than states or Constitutions.\" People v. Pignatoro , 136 N.Y.S. 155, 160 (Magis. Ct. 1911). The privilege extends, of course, to repelling the attacks ofaggressors, see, e.g. , Brown v. United States , 256 U.S. 335, 343- 44 (1921); cf. Montana v. Egelhoff , 518 U.S. 37, 56 (1996) (plurality opinion), but also protect s incursions into the property of others, see, e.g. , Ploof v. Putnam , 71 A. 188, 189 (Vt. 1908) (\"This doctrine of necessity app lies with special force to the preservation of human life. . . . One may sacrifice the personal8 3A person may assert self-defense rights against animals. See, e.g. , People v. Lee , 32 Cal. Rptr. 3d 745, 754-55 (Ct. App. 2005); Credit v. Brown , 10 Johns. 365 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1813).property of another to save his life or the lives of his fellows.\" (citation omitted)); Mouse's Case , 12 Co. Rep. 63, 77 Eng. Rep. 1341, 1342 (K.B. 1609) (deciding that it is lawful to throwoverboard property of another for safety of lives of passengers); R ESTATEMENT OF TORTS \u00a7 197 (1934). See generally George C. Christie, The Defense of Necessity Considered from the Legal and Moral Points of View , 48 D UKE L.J. 975 (1996). Although the concept of self-defense is most often thought of in terms of the response to an assault by another human being, its premisecompels the same response in the face of other forms ofaggression against life and limb, whether the aggressor be ananimal 3 or a diseased cell within one's body. There is, accordingly, no reason to think that the efforts of Alliancemembers to repel their terminal diseases do not implicate thisconcept. Aside from asserting that this case is not about efforts to preserve one's life, but rather the \"right to assume any level ofrisk,\" the court further avoids th e doctrines of self-defense and necessity by asserting that Congress can override the commonlaw. See Op. at 26. This is true but irrelevant. It was also true in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health , 497 U.S. 261 (1990), in which the Supreme Court discussed thefundamental right to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment, id. at 278. When the Court recognized that the common law tort of battery supported the fundamental right to refuse medicaltreatment, id. at 269, it did not constitutionalize the tort of battery. Similarly, recognizing that necessity has historicallybeen protected does not constitutionalize the doctrine ofnecessity. Yet the court resists the implications of the historicalprotection for actions prompted by necessity out of an9 4See, , Beck v. Haik , 377 F.3d 624, 633-34 (6th Cir. 2004) (discussing appropriate jury instruction for claim of interferenceunwarranted fear that acknowledging the historical record will constitutionalize the common law. See Op. at 22-23, 26. In so doing, it forgets the second part of the Glucksberg inquiry. A tradition of protection does not alone establish a fundamentalright. The subsequent determination of whether a right is\"implicit in the concept of or dered liberty\" invalidates the court's fears of a slippery slope. The common law also recognized the right of protection against interference with rescue . This right is infrequently invoked, but as early as 1889, it was acknowledged by thehighest court of the State of Maryland, which explained thateven prolongation of a fading life was not to be obstructed: Surely the law does not authorize the husband to say to his wife: \"You shall die of the cancer; you cannot becured, and a surgical operation affording onlytemporary relief, will result in useless expense.\" Thehusband had no power to withhold from his wife themedical assistance which her case might require. State v. Housekeeper , 16 A. 382, 383-84 (Md. 1889). The Restatement of Torts, published in 1934, generalized this pointof law: \"One who, without a pr ivilege to do so, intentionally prevents a third person from giving to another aid necessary tohis bodily security, is liable for bodily harm caused to the otherby the absence of aid which he has prevented the third personfrom giving.\" R ESTATEMENT OF TORTS \u00a7 326; 327 R ESTATEMENT ) OF TORTS \u00a7\u00a7 326, 327; W. PAGE KEETON ET AL ., PROSSER AND KEETON ON THE LAW OF TORTS 382 (5th ed. 1984). This common law rule is firmly grounded.4 By interposing itself between a terminally ill patient10 with rescue); Ross v. United States , 910 F.2d 1422 (7th Cir. 1990) (holding that a deputy sheriff committed a constitutional tort byinterfering with efforts to rescue a drowning boy); United States v. Lawter , 219 F.2d 559, 562 (5th Cir. 1955) (holding that the government is liable when it prevents others from attempting a rescueand takes no action itself); Sneider v. Hyatt Corp. , 390 F. Supp. 976, 980 & n.2 (N.D. Ga. 1975) (noting that \"deliberate interference withrescue efforts by third parties is a traditional basis for imposingliability\"); Soldano v. O'Daniels , 190 Cal. Rptr. 310, 313, (Ct. App. 1983) (applying Restatement); Thomas v. Williams , 124 S.E.2d 409, 414 (Ga. Ct. App. 1962) (sustaining cause of action forinterference with rescue where defe ndant prevented rescue of inmate from jail cell during fire); Riggs v. Colis , 695 P.2d 413, 415 (Idaho 1985) (applying Restatement); Long Island State Park Comm'n , 323 N.Y.S.2d 442 (Sup. Marcelli , 441 N.E.2d 270, 271 (Mass. Ct. App. 1982) (criminal liability); C AL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 148.2(1) (same). and her only means of prolonging her life, the FDA's policy runs counter to the common law's historical prohibition oninterfering with rescue. The common law protection, of course, is for rescues that are reasonably necessary. In an effort to distinguish thishistorical protection, the court relies upon the fact that the newinvestigational drugs \"have not b een shown to be safe, let alone effective at (or 'necessary' for) prolonging life.\" Op. at 25. Butthis confuses what is necessary w ith what is sufficient. This is not a case about elective medical treatments. Without access,Alliance members will die. No doubt the deceased members of the Alliance who were denied acce ss to experimental drugs that were subsequently approved by the FDA would have beensurprised to learn that these drugs, under the court's analysis,were unnecessary to the preservation of their lives. See Br. of Appellants at 31 n.15; Reply Br. of Appellants at 23. See generally Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental11 Drugs v. von Eschenbach , 469 F.3d 129 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\"Abigail Alliance II \"). Thus, the court's apparent understanding of the meaning of \"necessity\" is manifestly flawed. See Op. at 25 n.15. By the court's reasoning, it is not \"necessary\" for the driver of a car that is hurtling to ward a cliff to press the brake because we \"cannot know until after\" he has done so whether thecar will stop in time. Allian ce members, like the endangered driver, will perish without remedial steps. The questionpresented in this case is not whether investigational drugs arenecessary to a terminally ill patient who has exhausted conventional treatment options \u2014 they are \u2014 but who will make the subsequent decision about using these medications, thepatient with her doctor or the gove rnment. Moreover, as Prosser and Keeton have explained, \"[t]he principle [that one may notprevent aid by others] has been carried even to the length ofholding that there is liability for interfering with the possibilityof such aid.\" K EETON ET AL ., supra , at 382. Throughout its discussion of self-defense and interference with rescue, the court recognizes that common law rights are notunlimited but fails to acknowledge that the evolved limitationson hallowed rights do not undercut the core concerns thatanimate them \u2014 here, the special importance of life andattempts to preserve it. That the ultimate protection of such varying attempts to save life is cabined by precedents discussing\"necessity\" speaks not to the absence of an underlying right toattempt to protect life but rather to the recognition of competinggovernmental interests that in various circumstances justify thedeprivation of or a limitation upon the right. Whether similarcountervailing interests exist in th is case is a question bearing on the resolution of strict scrutiny analysis, not on whether it should apply. 3. Although the Supreme Court has not squarely addressed the right to use potentially life-saving medications , it has12 developed a sizable body of law regarding the right to a potentially life-saving medical procedure when the life or health of a pregnant woman is on the line. In Roe, 410 U.S. at 164-65, and again in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833, 846, 880 (1992), the Court held that even after fetal viability, a stat e cannot constitutionally proscribe abortion \"where it is necessary, in appropriate medicaljudgment, for the preservation of the life or health of themother,\" Roe, 410 U.S. at 164-65; Casey , 505 U.S. at 879 (plurality opinion); accord Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New Eng. , 546 U.S. 320, 327-28 (2006). In so doing, the Court acknowledged the tradition of \"'preserving the life of themother,'\" Roe, 410 U.S. at 137 (quoting Rex v. Bourne , [1939] 1 K.B. 687 (Crim. App.)), both in the common law, see id. , and in early state statutes, see id. at 138 (citing \"model\" legislation enacted in New York in 1828). In Stenberg v. Carhart , 530 U.S. 914 (2000), the Supreme Court squarely addressed whether a state may ban a particularmedical procedure in cases where a patient's health or life isendangered. The Court held that \"the governing standardrequires an exception 'where it is necessary, in appropriatemedical judgment for the preservati on of the life or health of the mother.'\" Id. at 931 (quoting Casey , 505 U.S. at 879). There, the State of Nebraska could not constitutionally ban particularabortion procedures, notwithstandi ng the state's \"interest in the potentiality of human life,\" id. at 930, even though the state claimed that there were adequate alternatives, id. at 931-32. Here, the situation is even star ker: The Alliance's terminally ill members have no remaining alternatives except the medicationsto which the FDA denies them access. This Term all ninejustices of the Supreme Court agreed that controlling precedents forbid the government from banning an abortion procedure \"ifit 'subject[ed] [women] to significant health risks,\" Gonzales S. Ct. at 1635 Ayotte , 546 U.S. at 328)13 (alterations in original); accord id. at 1641-42 (Ginsburg, J., with whom Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., join, dissenting),and the Court repeatedly emphasized the availability of safealternative procedures before approving the ban, see id. at 1636, 1637, 1638. The right sought by the Alliance pertains only tothose for whom no such alternatives exist. Consequently, for the court to conclude that the Supreme Court has not already decided that medical self-preservation isfundamental, the court is forced to conclude that when apatient's life is on the line, medical procedures like abortion areto be analyzed differently than medical treatments consisting of prescription medications. To draw this distinction, the FDAoffers only the empty assertion that \"the right to abort a fetus to save the life or health of the moth er is simply an aspect of the underlying constitutional right of abortion recognized in Roe.\" Brief for Appellees at 39. This ipse dixit cannot be reconciled with the fact that a woman's right to end a life-threatening pregnancy has long been uncontroversial in the face of statestatutory prohibitions against abortion and distinct from theconsiderations that otherwise bear on the procedure. \"Thecriminal abortion laws passed in every state by 1880 madeexceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to savea woman's life.\" L ESLIE J. REAGAN , WHEN ABORTION WAS A CRIME 5 (1997). Reaching farther back into history, as the Supreme Court discussed in Roe: The Ephesian, Soranos, often described as the greatest of the ancient gynecologists, appears to have beengenerally opposed to Rome's prevailing free-abortionpractices. He found it necessary to think first of thelife of the mother, and he resorted to abortion when,upon this standard, he felt the procedure advisable.14 410 U.S. at 130. This approach continued into the modern era. When England imposed criminal sanctions for abortion in 1861,it provided no explicit exception for pregnancies that endangerthe life or health of a mother. Offenses Against the Person Actof 1861, 24 & 25 Vict., c. 100, \u00a7 59. Nonetheless, an Englishcourt determined that the statute could not include proceduresnecessary to save the woman's life, because \"as in the case ofhomicide, so also in the case where an unborn child is killed,there may be justification for the act.\" Bourne , [1939] 1 K.B. at 690. This history suggests, contra ry to the FDA's view, that a woman's right to an abortion as an act of medical self-defense is independent from her right to an abortion based upon her right to make deeply personal decisions, see Casey , 505 U.S. at 581. The court chooses not to distinguish the abortion cases on this flimsy basis but its appro ach is no less startling. The court holds that because the Alliance seeks access only to \" potentially life-saving drugs,\" Op. at 28 (emphasis in original), the abortioncases are distinguishable. Nowhere in the Supreme Court'sjurisprudence has it intimated that the government may banprocedures that represent a patient's only chance of survivalbecause they might not be su ccessful. The fundamental right does not accrue only upon a demonstration of surefireactualization; the trigger is the necessity , which is crucially different from the sufficiency to which the court repeatedlyrefers. Indeed, in Stenberg , the Supreme Court addressed the level of medical consensus needed for a procedure to becomeprotected, holding that procedures supported by \"substantialmedical authority\" could not be proscribed. See 538 U.S. at 938. The Court was careful not to require medical unanimity,see id. at 937, or even \"general medical studies,\" see id. at 935, like those required for FDA approval of investigational newdrugs for commercial marketing, see 21 C.F.R. pt. 312. Although Gonzales v. Carhart clarifies that government may regulate to some extent \"where there is uncertainty over whether15 the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve . . . health, given the availability of other . . . procedures that are considered to be safe alternatives, 127 S. Ct. at 1638, Stenberg remains good law, and there are no alternatives to preserve life, let alonehealth, in this case. Although the FDA does not contend that its approval process reflects the Stenberg standard, the court nonetheless makes the wholly unsupported assertion that \"the collectivejudgment of the scientific and medical communities [is]expressed through the FDA's clinical testing process.\" Op. at26. To the contrary, the Alliance specifically alleges inattachments to its complaint that the FDA has denied terminally ill Alliance members access to investigational new drugs \"reported to have great potential,\" Decl. of Carole Steele Decl. of Victoria Jean Doran \u00b6 2. At this stage of the proceedings, the court isrequired to accept the Alliance's allegations as true. See, e.g. , Broudy v. Mather , 460 F.3d 106, 116 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Thus, there are situations where a te rminally ill patient seeks access to a new medication that has not ye t been approved by the FDA for commercial marketing but that has been recognized by themedical community as that patient's best chance to survive. In such instances, the Fifth Amendment guarantee of due processprotects the terminally ill patient's pursuit of those medications. There is, then, no merit to the FDA's suggestion adopted by the court that in the medical context there can be no deeplyrooted privilege to attempt to save one's own life with medicaladvances because medical advances capable of saving lives area relatively recent phenomenon. Br . of Appellee at 34-35; Op. at 21 & n.12. As the prior discussion demonstrates, the Alliancecorrectly disputes the premise of this argument. 16 B. Against this substantial historical record demonstrating the deep roots of the right to preserve one's own life, it is nocoincidence that neither the court nor the FDA can marshalevidence from the early history of the Nation demonstrating that the federal government or any state thought to restrain theterminally ill from accessing medical treatments and proceduresthat had not proven unsafe but were of unknown efficacy. Still, the court asserts that \"a lack of government interference . . .cannot be enough\" to demonstrate th at a right is deeply rooted. This reasoning is misguided. First, the most fundamental rights are those that no government of the people would contemplate abridging \u2014 it isdoubtful that many courts or legisl atures have discussed whether the government can determine whether we are allowed tobreathe air, but this does not make our access to oxygen any less grounded in history. Cf. U.S. CONST . amend. IX (stating that \"[t]he enumeration in the Cons titution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by thepeople\"). In considering whether the terminally ill patient'sinterest in self-preservation is protected by the Due ProcessClause, the court overlooks the most fundamental evidence ofthe protection that the Alliance claims, namely that the words \"life\" and \"liberty\" are in the Due Process Clause itself. Theright to life, and the asserted corollary right to attempt to preserve life, is not a second derivative species of \"liberty\"whose protection by the Constitution should be approached withskepticism. Insofar as courts s hould be skeptical of interfering with the legislative debate and ongoing democratic discussionsabout fundamental issues of life and death, that skepticism isbetter applied to the latter portion of the strict scrutiny analysis\u2014 the evaluation of the competing government interests and thegreater or lesser narrowness of the tailoring required in the faceof scientific uncertainty and conflicting opinions. See Abigail17 Alliance I , 445 F.3d at 478 n.9. To deny the constitutional importance of the right to life a nd to attempt to preserve life is to move from judicial modesty to judicial abdication, as well as confusion, and deprive an express constitutional interest of itsdue weight in the court's analysis. Second, the Supreme Court's statements on fundamental rights do not support the court's conclusion. In Glucksberg itself, the Supreme Court determined that the claimed right toassisted suicide was not deeply rooted because \"for over 700years, the Anglo-American common-law tradition has punishedor otherwise disapproved of both suicide and assisting suicide.\" 521 U.S. at 711. In the Court' s words: \"[W]e are confronted with a consistent and almost universal tradition that has longrejected the asserted right, and continues explicitly to reject ittoday, even for terminally ill, mentally competent adults.\" Id. at 723. But the Supreme Court did not say, as the FDA arguedand this court appears to agree, that a right can be fundamental only if it has been acknowledged by statute or decisional law.A plurality of the Supreme Court said the opposite in Michael H. v. Gerald D. , 491 U.S. 110, 122 n.2 (1989), in observing that historical \"protection need not take the form of an explicitconstitutional provision or statutory guarantee, but it must atleast exclude . . . a societal tradition of enacting laws denyingthe interest.\" Third, the court's concern that \"such a premise [would] support sweeping claims of fundamental rights\" neglects theexistence of the second Glucksberg criterion. Strict scrutiny is not triggered just by a history of protection \u2014 otherwise, the entire common law would be constitutionalized. It is the secondrequirement, that a right be \"'implicit in the concept of orderedliberty,' such that 'neither liber ty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed,'\" 521 U.S. at 702 (quoting Palko , 302 U.S. at 325, 326), that guards against unwarranted expansion of18 5Although the FDA does not stop examining drug safety after Phase I, nor does it stop after drugs receive full marketingapproval. The FDA has pulled approved such drugs from the market,but it does not follow that the FDA can take any action abridging anysubstantive due process rights. Just as in the context of the necessity defense at common law, the court conflates these twodistinct inquiries, and in its ha ste to acquire a limiting principle, it constructs a significant and unw arranted roadblock to judicial recognition of fundamental rights. This roadblock starts fromthe Supreme Court's requirement, in the interest of judicialrestraint, that '[s]ubstantive due process' analysis must beginwith a careful description of the asserted right.\" Reno v. Flores , 507 U.S. 292, 301 (1993). Although the court appropriatelyassumes the Alliance has satisfied the requirement in this case, the court then errs by effectively holding that the firstGlucksberg criterion can be satisfied only by historical evidence involving the exact situation that the Alliance presented to ustoday. It offers no principled reason for ignoring highly relevant evidence, particularly with respect to the historical recordconcerning abortion to save the life of the mother. Fourth, in the alternative, th e court shifts the target and looks to historical evidence of regulation for safety . The court claims that post-Phase I testing is designed not only to test adrug's efficacy but also to conti nue monitoring its safety. Op. at 15. As support, the court lists instances in which drugs havebeen removed from the market after Phase I because of safetyconcerns. See id. at 20 n.11. This inquiry confuses the right \u2014 to save one's life \u2014 with the alleged deprivation, which hereoccurs by means of an agency policy. Whether the FDA policy actually impermissibly infringes upon the asserted right is afactual question that is not properly resolved at the motion-to-dismiss stage when all reasonable inferences must be drawn tothe plaintiff's benefit, see, e.g. , Broudy , 460 F.3d at 116. 519 right, related or not, on the basis of its legitimate interest in safety. At a certain point, the FDA determines that a drug is safe enough forwidespread testing, and the Alliance alleges that this marker is Phase I approval, where the FDA authorizes expanded testing in up to\"several hundred 1997 and 2000, 5.34 percent of fully approved new drugs were pulled from the market. Kris Hundley, Drug's Chilling Path to Market , S T. PETERSBURG TIMES , May 27, 2007, at 1A. Since then, many more approved drugs have been withdrawn.

REV. 105, 109 (1995); see also Gonzales v. Raich , 545 U.S. 1, 11-13 (2005). FDA Historian Wallace F. Janssen writes that prior to 1906 was the\"heyday of 'patent medicines,'\" a time when \"[a]nyone, no matterhow ignorant or unqualified, could go into the drug manufacturingbusiness\" and when \"[m]edicines . . . were sold without restriction atalmost every crossroads store.\" Wallace F. Janssen, Outline of the History of U.S. Drug Regulation and Labeling , 36 F OOD DRUG COSM. L.J. 420, 422 (1981) (hereinafter \"Janssen, Outline of the History \"). He further recounts that in \"co lonial days, and long afterward, consumers . . . were their own food and drug inspectors,\" \"there wasa striking absence of statutes dealing with drugs,\" and, although therewere food inspection laws and standards for weights and measures, see id. at 423, 425, \"drug laws were virtually non-existent.\" Janssen, America's First Food and Drug Laws , 30 F OOD DRUG COSM. L.J. 665, 669, 671 (1975). This suggests that in this Nation's early history therewere no restrictions on a patient's access to potentially life-savingmedications, regardless of whatever restrictions may have been placedon physicians, pharmacists, apothecaries, poisons, or misbranded oradulterated substances. See id. at 669-72; Janssen, Outline of the History , supra , at 426-28. But cf . Op. at 16-18. saving medicines sought by terminally ill patients who have no alternative treatment options. By redirecting its inquiry, the court conveniently avoids the sparse history of drug regulation for efficacy. See Abigail Alliance I , 445 F.3d at 481-83. Prior to 1906, there was essentially no drug regulation in the United States saveprotections against fraud and adulteration. 6 In 1906, Congress enacted the Pure Food and Drug Act (\"1906 Act\"), ch. 7See Steven R. Salbu, Regulation of Drug Treatments for HIV and AIDS: A Contractarian Model of Access , 11 Y ALE J. ON REG. 401, 406-09 (1994); James L. Zelenay, Jr., The Prescription Drug User Fee Act: Is a Faster Food and Drug Administration Always aBetter Food and Drug Administration? , 60 F OOD & DRUG L.J. 261, 263-64 (2005); cf. Minnesota ex rel. Whipple v. U.S. 41, 45 (1921). 8See Salbu, supra note 7, at 407. adulterated foods or drugs from entering interstate commerce, id. \u00a7 2, 34 Stat. at 768, and prohibited false and misleading labeling, id. \u00a7 8, 34 Stat. at 770. For a small number of particularly dangerous drugs, th e 1906 Act required the labels to identify the drug's ingredients and quantities. Id. The statute also authorized the Bureau of Chemistry, a predecessor of the FDA, to seize nonconforming goods and to recommend federal prosecution of those who violated the 1906 Act. Id. \u00a7 4, 34 Stat. at 769. The 1906 Act did not, however, limit individual accessto new drugs or regulate therapeutic claims by drugmanufacturers. Cf. United States v. Johnson , 221 U.S. 488 (1911). It thus appears that a patient still could obtain access to any new drug for medicinal us e, even if the drug had no therapeutic benefit, albeit subj ect to the controls placed on narcotics by the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, ch. 1, 38 Stat.785. 7 In 1938, Congress enacted the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"1938 Act\" or \"FDC A\") in response to the deaths of more than one hundred peopl e, many of them children, from ingesting Elixir Sulfanilamide, which had been marketed as anantibiotic. See R EPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE ON DEATHS DUE TO ELIXIR SULFANILAMIDE -MASSENGILL , S. DOC. NO. 75-124, at 1-3 (1937) (\"1937 REPORT \").8 For the first time, Congress required that drug manufacturers test, and the FDA22 9See Zelenay, supra note 7, at 264-65. 10Id. 11See Michael D. Greenberg, AIDS, Experimental Drug Approval, and the FDA New Drug Screening Process , 3 N.Y.U. J. LEGIS. & PUB.

Ch. 653, 52 St at. 1040 (1938) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq. ); 1937 REPORT , supra , at 1- 3. Under the 1938 Act, a new drug could be commerciallymarketed only after the manufacturer filed a New DrugApplication (\"NDA\") with the FDA that set forth medical andscientific information attesting to the drug's safety. The 1938Act did not, however, require drug manufacturers to receiveaffirmative FDA approval before marketing the drug. 9 Rather, an NDA became automatically effective within a time frame setby the FDA unless the FDA determ ined that the drug was unsafe and barred its commercial distribution. 10 It was not until 1951, in the Durham-Humphrey Amendment, that Congress createdthe category of prescription drugs, i.e., drugs that are unsafe forself-medication but that can be used while under a doctor'ssupervision. See Act of Oct. 26, 1951, ch. 578, 65 Stat. 648 (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 353(b)). Only in 1962 did Congress require drug manufacturers to provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of a drug as opposed to evidence of the drug's safety. 11 The Kefauver-Harris Amendments, Pub. L. No. 87- 781, 76 Stat. 780 (1962) (codified in scattered sections of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-81), were enacted inresponse to the rash of birth defects discovered in babies whosemothers had taken Thalidomide to ease morning sickness caused23 12See Salbu, supra note 7, at 408 n.41.

REV. , 470 U.S. 821 (1985).by pregnancy.12 The Kefauver-Harris Amendments transformed drug regulation and the approval process in several respects.First, the Amendments required the FDA to review a new drug for both safety and effectiveness and specified that todemonstrate effectiveness manufacturers were required tosubmit data from \"adequate and well-controlled investigations.\"21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d). Second, th e Amendments authorized the FDA to approve human clinical trials, regulate drug advertising, inspect drug-manufacturing facilities, and promulgate goodmanufacturing practices. The Am endments also required drug manufacturers to disclose to the FDA any information theyreceived regarding the adverse consequences of approveddrugs. 13 This legislation set the framework for the system of drug regulation currently in place. Despite the increased federal scrutiny of new drugs, important aspects of patient access to drugs are unregulated bythe government and appear always to have been unregulated.The \"FDA's regulatory authority . . . extends to manufacturersof drugs but not to the physicians who dispense them.\" 14 Thus, a doctor may \u2014 and approximately 21% of the time does \u2014prescribe a drug to a patient for a purpose other than that for24 15See David C. Radley et al., Off-Label Prescribing Physicians , 166 A RCHIVES INTERNAL MED. 1021 (2006) (studying 2001 data of office-based 16See Salbu, supra note 14, at 189-92 . 17See id. at 211. which the FDA has approved the use of the drug.15 Such \"off- label\" use may occur even if the drug is not deemed safe oreffective for that use, such as when a drug studied only foradults is prescribed for a child. Further, it appears that the FDA has never prohibited either off-la bel prescription or off-label use of drugs. 16 In recent years, the FDA has been moving to permit drug manufacturers to promote the use of their drugs for off-label purposes in limited circumstances. 17 See Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, Pub. L. No.105-115, 111 Stat. 2296 (codified in scattered sections of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-81). For more than half of this Nation's history, then, until the enactment of the 1906 Act, a person could obtain access to anynew drug without any government interference whatsoever.Even after enactment of th e FDCA in 1938, Congress imposed no limitation on the commercial marketing of new drugs basedupon the drugs' efficacy. Rather, at that time, the FDA couldinterrupt the sale of new drugs only if it determined that the newdrug was unsafe. Government regulation of such drugspremised on concern over a ne w drug's efficacy, as opposed to its safety, is of very recent orig in. Even today, a patient may use a drug for unapproved purposes where the drug may be unsafeor ineffective for the off-label purpose. In short, encumbranceson the treatment decisions of a patient and her physician lack thehistorical pedigree of the rights that the Alliance seeks tovindicate.25 Instead of confronting this history, the court relies on statutory restrictions that address misbranded or adulterateddrugs, sales of poisons, and fraudulent curative claims, see Op. at 17-18 & n.8, government restrictions that are not inconsistentwith the right of a person to atte mpt to save her own life. None of the cited restrictions, focusing largely on the licensing ofpharmacists, suggest a physician could not prescribe a newmedication for a terminal patient. While Congress has imposedincreased responsibilities on the drug industry and the FDAupon evidence of tragic consequen ces of some new drugs as a result of new technology, see Abigail Alliance I , 445 F.3d at 482, the FDA does not regulate physicians, id. at 483, and off- label prescription of medications is a long-standing practice that has not been outlawed, id. Elsewhere the court relies on straw men that are either acknowledged by the court to be irrelevant, Op. at 17 n.8 (an incident in 1630 not the result of \"legislativeor regulatory intervention\"); or are in fact irrelevant, id. at 30 n.18 (discussing \"affirmative access claim[s]\" even though theAlliance makes no such claim); or are speculative, id. at 21 n.12 (noting \"a more plausible explanation for the limited efficacyregulation\"); see also Amicus Br. for Economists John E. Calfee et al. This analysis hardly overcomes the history andConstitutional recognition of the unde rlying right to life that the Alliance claims. The common law traditions protecting necessity, forbidding interference with rescue, and supporting self-defense, and the Supreme Court's validation of the fundamental right of apregnant woman to undergo a medical procedure to save herown life demonstrate that the protected liberty interest of theterminally ill to choose whether to pursue prescriptionmedications that may save their lives is deeply rooted in this Nation's history. Nothing in the history of drug regulationdemonstrates otherwise. In view of the common law history,there is no occasion to determine how the first Glucksberg26 inquiry would be evaluated were there no evidence supporting or refuting a historical basis fo r a claimed fundamental right. II. For a right to be fundamental, the Glucksberg analysis requires that it also be \"'imp licit in the concept of ordered liberty,' such that 'neither liber ty nor justice would exist if they were Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 721 (quoting Palko , 302 U.S. at 325, 326). The Supreme Court has explained thatthis expression \"encompasses and protects the personalintimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood,procreation, and child rearing.\" Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton , 413 U.S. 49, 65 (1973). It also safeguards the \"freedom ofthought and speech,\" Palko , 302 U.S. at 326, and \"[t]he security of one's privacy against arb itrary intrusion by the police,\" Wolf v. Colorado , 338 U.S. 25, 27-28 (1949), overruled on other grounds by Mapp v. Ohio , 367 U.S. 643 (1961). In the context of criminal trials, matters \"implicit in the concept of orderedliberty\" include \"the right to counsel at trial,\" Teague v. Lane , 489 U.S. 288, 311 (1989) (plurality opinion) (quoting Mackey v. United States , 401 U.S. 667, 693-94 (1971) (opinion of Harlan, J.)); the presumption that \"all are innocent until the statehas proved them to be guilty,\" United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739, 763 (1987); and \"[t]he principle that a State may notknowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, toobtain a tainted conviction,\" Napue v. Illinois , 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959). Unlike Glucksberg 's historical inquiry, this step assesses whether the Alliance's claimed right is a component of the\"compendious expression for all those rights which the courtsmust enforce because they are basic to our free society.\" Wolf , 338 U.S. at 27. As Justice Frankf urter wrote, these rights create \"a realm of sanctuary surrounding every individual and27 infrangible, save in a very limited class of circumstances, by the agents of government.\" Monroe v. Pape , 365 U.S. 167, 208-09 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), maj. op. overruled by Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. , 436 U.S. 658 (1978). Setting aside the textual anchor of the Alliance's claim in the right to life, the claimed right also falls squarely within the realm of rights implicit in ordered liberty. The core of liberty isautonomy. As Professor Charles Fried writes, \"[l]iberty is theexercise of our powers as self-conscious, judging individuals,individuals who in making our own lives cannot be responsible to anyone . . . else except as we choose to be.\" C HARLES FRIED, MODERN LIBERTY 180 (2007). It is difficult to imagine any context in which this liberty in terest would be stronger than in trying to save one's own life. Cf. BRIAN CLARK , WHOSE LIFE IS IT ANYWAY ? (1978). The Supreme Court engaged in similar analysis in Cruzan . In evaluating the claim that due process protects a person's right to refuse life-sustaining treatment, the Court reasoned that \"itcannot be disputed that the Due Process Clause protects aninterest in life as well as an interest in refusing life-sustainingmedical treatment.\" 497 U.S. at 281. The Court acknowledged that \"[t]he principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwantedmedical treatment,\" could be inferred from its prior decisions.Id. at 278. Like the right claimed in Cruzan , the right claimed by the Alliance to be free of FDA imposition does not involvetreatment by the government or a government subsidy. Rather,the Alliance seeks only to have the government step aside so as not to interfere with the individual right of self-determination.The Alliance claims that there is a protected right of terminally ill patients to choose to use potentially life-savinginvestigational new drugs that have been determined to be safefor substantial human testing. This reasoning tracks Eisenstadt28 v. Baird , 405 U.S. 438 (1972), where the Supreme Court noted that the right to be free from unwanted government intrusioninto the fundamental decision whether to have childrenestablishes a right of access to contraceptives, id. at 453. In summary, there is no logic to be found, in view of oft- limited rights considered inherent in the nature of orderedliberty, see Abigail Alliance II , 469 F.3d at 136-37, in the conclusion that the right to save one's life is unprotectednotwithstanding the specific protec tion afforded life in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. III. For these reasons, I have serious disagreements with the court's assessment of the Alliance's claim to a fundamental rightprotected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. It is nomore than tragic wordplay to suggest that the Alliance's libertyclaim to potentially life prolongi ng medications, when no other government approved alternatives exist, does not involve acorollary to the right to life enshrined in the Fifth Amendmentto the Constitution. See Op. at 11 n.5. Denying a terminally ill patient her only chance to survive without even a strict showing of governmental necessity presupposes a dangerous brand ofpaternalism. As the court phrases it, because \" [w]e . . . cannot know until the clinical testing pr ocess has been completed that these drugs are necessary,\" Op. at 25 n.15 (emphasis added), the terminally ill patient, informed by her physician, is denied aright to decide whether to bear those risks in an attempt to preserve her life. Such interven tion is directly at odds with this Nation's history and traditions giving recognition to individual self-determination and autonomy where one's own life is atstake and should extend no further than the result in this case.Because the right of a termina lly ill patient to access potentially life-saving investigational medications satisfies the Glucksberg29 test, I would remand this case for the district court to assess in the first instance whether there exists a compellinggovernmental interest, narrowly tailored, to overcome theAlliance's interest. Flores , 507 U.S. at 302. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent. "}
