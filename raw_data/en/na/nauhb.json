True spiritual healing for mind, body, spirit & soul. \"Chris's MDLT process has taken my healing to an entirely new level. I've had a complex series of traumatic brain injuries which caused anxiety, depression, panic attacks, food sensitivities, and chronic pain due to skeletal and neural misalignment. Thanks to the MDLT work (assisted by Mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, Quan Yin, and others), and my neurological rehab, I've noticed significant improvements in my body, mind, and spirit. Even my doctor could tell a difference in my body since we started MDLT. Over 90% of my symptoms are gone! I'm now more content and in-tune physically, spiritually, and emotionally than ever before. During each session, the soothing Source energy is palpable, and I always leave feeling lighter. The channeled portion of the session is most interesting to me; it's so illuminating to hear Spirit communicate through Chris about the specifics of my journey, and I've gotten invaluable insight from these messages. We're now in the next phase, which, with the help of Sophia, has already sparked a (safe) Kundalini awakening and expanded my awareness of the astral realms.\" -W.M., Franklin, TN \"All who believe\" -Mark 9:23 \"For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't, no proof is possible.\" -Stuart Chase Are You Seeking Spiritual Guidance and connection with A Higher source? Do you yearn for an experience of genuine, visceral contact with The Divine? Have you longed to actually feel/sense the presence of the The Illumined Ones? Angel Collectives, Ascended Masters, or other Holy/Supreme Beings? Could a Facilitated Mystical Experience (FME) and guided spiritual healing be the key to feeling more peace, embodiment, and certainty of your inherent worth? Your place, and purpose in the material world? The interconnectedness of all, and the eternality of the soul? Multidimensional Divine Light Transmission (MDLT) is an organic extension of my own spiritual work/initiation process. The name itself was transmitted (downloaded) by Higher Sources. Originally cultivated within the context of my personal breakdown-to-breakthrough awakening odyssey of the last many years, I was recently 'nudged' to begin synchronously utilizing my ability to enlist benevolent Higher Sources to assist others with their healing, alignment, spiritual discernment, perception, and unfoldment goals. Unlike mediumship\u2014wherein the voice of a crossed-over loved one is translated through someone in a psychic capacity once removed\u2014Multidimensional Divine Light Transmission organically invokes the willing presence of one or more 'highest and holiest' Supreme Beings (Highest Order) within the Christic spectrum of love and light; aka the I AM Presence, esoterically speaking. Examples thus far include Christ/Yeshua, Seraphim, Elohim, Mother Mary, Mary of Magdala, Goddesses Sophia and Isis, Melchizedek, and various Ascended Masters. The spiritual host/guide(s) for any MDLT session works through us both. The experience is co-facilitated by me, but is exclusively for you. By virtue of your willingness, desire, and openness to receive, you are a passive/receptive yet co-creative participant in the process. Who comes through for you is the result of Divine wisdom of who/what is in ones highest good. In most cases I can ascertain the identity of the host/guide ahead of time via the intuitive (claircognizant-clairsentient) ability I've been granted and honing over the last 5 years or so. This is no definitely not conventional therapy. Might not be best considered a therapy at all. Or perhaps the ultimate therapy. I don't know. What I do know is, MDLT is my most 'off-label,' metaphysical, transpersonal, and unique offering...yet anyway. If you feel a resonance, I look forward to working with you to bring about new healing and spiritual wisdom perspectives in your life. \"I've practiced a good deal of meditation, often visualizing the white (considered \"Christ\") light of unconditional love...I knew being in Chris' tranquil space, with his presence as a channel, was exactly what I needed in this season. I'm forever grateful for Chris' offerings. I have grown more in confidence and attunement to my most authentic longings in the last months doing this work with him than in my entire adult life. His support and the wisdom that comes through the guides during the MDLT experience has given me strength to make big choices and life changes...I am experiencing the reality that I am infinitely loved and supported by all my guides and higher power. My trust in myself is stronger than ever and I have no doubt where to look and listen within when I need to find my truest self. I am eternally grateful for the courageous and authentic work Chris has tirelessly and confidently developed.\" B.A., Nashville, TN How Can genuine Spiritual contACt and spiritual Healing Benefit Our Minds, Bodies, & Souls? Since 2020 an accelerated planetary shift has clearly been underway, initiating a heightened consciousness among the masses. More and more of us are waking up to the empty promises of materialistic mainstream culture. The biases and propaganda of our media, and betrayals, hypocrisies, and corruption of many of our major financial, academic, medical and centralized religious institutions. This has left many of us more hungry than ever for genuine, meaningful access to truth, i.e gnosis, via Source, Spirit, God, or Divine Figure\u2014however you conceptualize it\u2014is possible. (Spoiler alert: It is!). Many of us yearn for what psychological anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann calls a 'Spiritual Presence Experience.' Or what multiple Near-Death Experiencer (NDE) and Dr. Yvonne Kason termed a potentially 'Spiritually Transformative Experience' (STE). These are otherwise known as 'non-ordinary' events or experiences. Often they're spontaneous, such as with NDEs. But just as After Death Contacts (ADCs) can actually be induced (See: the work of Dr. Alan J Botkin, and my own [Transpersonal approach to IFS](https://www.therapyoutsidethebox.com/internal-family-systems-therapy)) we set also the stage, opening the 'field of possibilities' with sincerity, intention, reverence, gratitude and polite expectation. What I've personally long felt and now know to be true since emerging by the grace of God out of an insidious, near-decade long Dark Night of the Soul into an awakening/initiation experience, is that spiritual contact, revelation, and healing is not the exclusive domain of saints, sages, mystics, psychics, yogic masters, or spiritual luminaries. With a little faith, trust, a sense of awe, reverence, openness to experience, an attitude of gratitude, a basic sense of safety in our body, with others and Spirit\u2014and the right practice/ritual or guide at the right time\u2014we are all capable of establishing and perceiving contact with The Generous Heart of God, the 'I AM That I AM,' in whatever form or forms it chooses to express. MDLT offers a safe forum and opportunity to experience this firsthand. Zooming out, we can begin to see how most of humanity's ails stem from a disconnection from Source/The Divine. And a culturally-enforced belief that we are unworthy of God's love, mercy, and forgiveness. That's why beneath the surface of anxiety, depression, nervous system dysregulation, interpersonal conflict, chronic emptiness, existential dread and suicidality lies a basis of spiritual disconnection. Of feeling somehow forsaken, or intrinsically separate from from Source. Nothing can be further from the truth. And if a lack of felt-connection Source is part of the problem, then The Divine itself is part of the solution. MDLT operates from the premise that there is a potential spiritual solution for every life challenge. Through (re)connecting and sustaining contact with Higher Source(s) on our own\u2014once we've personally experienced that connection\u2014we can accelerate our healing and awakening on every level. MDLT sessions have already inspired many of my clients to begin a dedicated mindfulness, contemplative, or meditation practice in which the truth and wisdom of \"Be still and know and I AM God\" becomes more than just a passage, but a felt sense reality. Multidimensional Divine Light Transmission Through Therapy Outside the Box Within my practice, MDLT has thus far been used to guide clients in: Practicing faith, trust, and surrender to the Divine Will by allowing what's in 'the highest good' to express to and through you via the host/guide for your session Trauma healing support Reduction of **acute physical pain, insight into root causes/mitigation strategies Attuning, balancing, regulating the nervous system and energetic body/energy centers Post-concussion neuro-physiological and structural realignment support Dissolving fear down to the cellular level Healing harmful or outdated ancestral/generational patterns Greater self-embodiment, awakening intuition, and safe, progressive kundalini activation Clearing emotional, creative, and energetic/energy center blocks Dissolving and transmuting negative karma Enhancing the capacity for self-compassion, love and forgiveness of self and other Connecting to Higher Self / Holy Christ Self / Ascension support Compassionately releasing and ushering on foreign entities/energies, energetic parasites/attachments/egregores (unattached burdens in IFS parlance) from our mind-body-spirit complex. Spiritual healing, awakening and consciousness expansion in general (** An early MDLT experiment brought a level 8 migraine to a 3 in my wife in less than an hour, courtesy of The Seraphim) But this list is hardly exhaustive because, under the right conditions, what can't Spirit do? What To Expect/ How it works Spiritual healing sessions using MDLT are 100% guided by pure consciousness/one or more Higher Sources. My role is as an intuitive, conduit/bridge, grounding force and discernment gatekeeper, so that you can more easily trust and surrender to the calm, compassionate, loving, potentially transformative effect of the particular host/guide's spiritual presence, energy and intentions for you in the session. Typically the sessions are conducted mostly in silence. We begin by my inviting/invoking the Divine Realm, the 'highest and holiest,' et al with expressions of reverence, awe, infinite love and gratitude. Any prayer or personal expression of thankfulness and/or request for protection is welcome and may be expressed at the outset. (I also pray, decree, and affirm silently throughout). If there is a specific ask or intention, it may be verbalized at the start. From there, we enter into a relaxed, co-meditative, mild trance state, opening the way for Spirit to do the work it comes in to do for you. I myself fall into a mildly Altered State of Consciousness (ASC) while functioning as a bridge for Spirit. Yet I remain fully embodied, present, and able to respond to you at any point. Mechanically/technically speaking, my rudimentary understanding is that the spiritual host/guide for the session lowers his/her energy (up to 80%) down to meet mine. A sacred geometrical, circular toroidal/torus field of energy is established as the healing energy descends from Spirit, down into me, through you, back up and around it goes. I somatically experience this energy, as evidenced by the way my head rotates around in the infinity symbol formation throughout. Some of my clients feel or sense this circular energy. Some don't. Everyone's experience is unique. Sessions last from 40 to 60 minutes, sometimes longer. At the conclusion, specific questions can be posed and we can process your experience if you wish. Lately more and more the host/guide stays connected to conscious channel a message through me, for you. If the idea of 'channeling' freaks you out, know that it's more common and normal than you might have been led to believe. It's also optional. Just an 'extra.' It can simply be viewed as 'inspired dialogue.' In any case, the messages that come through for those who are open to it typically speak to what was offered/conducted in the session, along with general words of wisdom, love, support, and encouragement. Sometimes even 'spiritual homework\" is suggested! \"WOW...I am walking in exuberant joy after my session with Chris today!...Not only did my Guardian Angel and a loved one visit our space, but we were blessed with the presence of Jesus Christ! He is my savior, my friend, my Heavenly Father who spoke a beautiful message into my spirit. It was surreal and overwhelming, but mostly humbling as He showed His love for me, just as he loves and cares for each of us. I am so grateful for Chris and the work he does which held an opportunity and space for me to have interaction with Jesus, my Guardian Angel and my loved one.\" -T.T., Franklin TN Still Unsure If MDLT Can Help You? What if I don't feel, perceive, or sense anything? Does that mean it didn't work, or that no higher Sources came through for me? What each person experiences in Multidimensional Divine Light Transmission is entirely unique to them, to time and place. Having some orientation toward inner life (i.e., a capacity for 'absorption' into inner experience (common in those who pray, meditate, and/or are explorers of spirituality, metaphysics, and mystical experiences) seems to helps heighten perception of spiritual presence/contact. But it's not a requirement. Welcome are those with healthy, open-minded skepticism (always wise) and/or who identify as '[ontological] agnostic.' Meaning, no buy-in is necessary as to the actual sources conducting the work, and no religious or spiritual ideology need be adhered to, as larger spiritual reality transcends all belief systems. As Mother Mary stated in one session: \"There are no religions in heaven.\" MDLT is ecumenical in the highest, broadest sense of the term. All that's needed is a willingness to engage, sincerity of intent, absence of fear, and an openness to the possibility of there existing a loving Higher Source or Power. While I cannot predict what anyone will or won't feel, sense or experience, if the above criteria are met, chances are great that at the very least a unique sense of calm, peace, and loving energy will be perceptible. With all that said, a leap of faith can be required to participate in MDLT! Sometimes, you gotta go out on the limb. That's where the fruit is! As for myself, I know, trust and believe that the sources who come through are who they identify as, and come with a love-based offering of whatever is needed at this time\u2014 whether a tangible felt-sense of it is experienced or not. What if I hear/sense/feel/see something disturbing or frightening? Not one of my clients has expressed noticing any fear, distress or even the slightest discomfort during a Multidimensional Divine Light Transmission experience. On the contrary, they tend to experience a sense of being held, compassionately seen, loved and supported. For some, this has been confirmed in unmistakably overt ways\u2014such as hearing, downloading/direct receiving of mental impressions of messages right from the host/guide(s). A few have spontaneously voice channeled the messages of the host/guide without every having done so or thought it possible. Wild to witness, I tell you! I make sure to assess readiness, dispel concerns, and address any preconceived, fear-based culturally-conditioned notions before we start, so that a clean and clear as possible experience can take place. One thing I'm rock solid confident about: The Supreme/Higher Sources of pure consciousness, of infinite love and light that join us have no intention of harming, scaring or disturbing us in any way. That's more the domain of earthbound discarnates/tramp souls, tricksters, lower astral entities, and beings of the false-light. I've encountered these energies before and know the difference. They're not invited. It's also my view that with the amount of meditation/communion with Higher Sources, prayer, decrees, and the continuous presence of the Divine and Holy Ones in the space in which this work is conducted, the high, love and gratitude-based frequency/vibration this generates is hardly enticing to earthbound or lower astral energies. Too much work for them to penetrate! That's said, I don't ever take psychic protection for granted. Nor will I ever get lax on my commitment to continuous spiritual discernment. How many sessions of MDLT do I need? There is no formal commitment needed for spiritual healing sessions. There's the option to experience one MDLT session (as a one-off, on a consultation-basis), as desired, as a series, or in an ongoing capacity (all subject to schedule and availability). It may be suggested that in certain situations such as for example, significant trauma-induced nervous system disturbance or say, concussion-induced physiological structural misalignment, multiple sessions will likely be needed to initiate the full spectrum of benefit that Spirit/Source can provide\u2014as a compliment (not a replacement for) whatever medical, neurological, physiological or other treatment may be needed. At the end of the day, the time you spend in MDLT will ultimately come down to what you perceive as the benefit of the transmissions. \"We Are Spirits In The Material World\" - The Police MDLT is a form of spiritual healing that I am overjoyed to offer to those interested in a Facilitated Mystical Experience, courtesy of loving Higher Sources. The reality is that the spiritual realm is with and around us all the time. Closer than we might think! Especially our loved ones, guides and ministering (aka Guardian) angel. And the highest and holiest are most certainly available to intercede, but for the asking. As noted spiritual teacher, international author, philanthropist, and lifelong angel whisperer, Lorna Byrne puts it: \"All we have to do is ask.\" The most difficult part is often accepting the simplicity, as that can mean changing one's idea about what reality is.
