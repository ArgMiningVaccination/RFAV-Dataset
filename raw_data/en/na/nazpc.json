What is Anthroposophy? \"By anthroposophy I understand a scientific research of the spiritual world which sees through the one-sidedness of both normal, natural science and traditional mysticism. Anthroposophy seeks to develop those forces of soul not yet active in normal consciousness and science but which make possible such a penetration into the supersensible world.\" - Rudolf Steiner During the last two decades of the nineteenth century the Austrian-born Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) became a respected and well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, particularly known for his writings. After the turn of the century he began to develop his earlier philosophical principles into an approach to methodological research of psychological and spiritual phenomena. His multi-faceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, science, educations (Waldorf schools), special education, philosophy, religion, economics, agriculture (Bio-Dynamic method) architecture, drama, the new art of eurythmy, and other fields. In 1924 he founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world, including here in Denver, Colorado. I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming. "}
