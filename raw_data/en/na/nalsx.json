For many of us, building up the body's defence against disease-causing bacteria and viruses means eating plenty of fruit and vegetables, exercising well and not smoking. But there's another critical factor - mental health. [mental health](https://www.scmp.com/topics/mental-health?module=inline&pgtype=article), we have a weaker [immune system](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3048439/coronavirus-how-stay-healthy-and-happy-during-virus?module=inline&pgtype=article),\" says Dr Hannah Reidy, CEO of non-profit group Mind HK. The mind-body connection is well established. Research over the past 20 years has shown how stress negatively affects the functioning of white blood cells. What's more, vaccination is less effective and wounds heal less readily in those who are stressed. The mind-body connection means that thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes can positively or negatively affect our biological functioning. Simply put, our mind can affect our body. \"Our thoughts are linked to how we feel emotionally and physically. If we have anxious or catastrophic thoughts, we may have sleeping difficulties or a lack of energy. The mind and body are well linked,\" says Reidy. A recognition of the mind-body connection is nothing new - traditional medicine systems around the world have always treated the two as a whole. The shift came about in the 17th century led by mathematician and philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes. He is best known for saying, 'Cogito ergo sum' ('I think therefore I am', or, more accurately, 'I think therefore I exist') - and with those words helped establish the split between the mind and the body.

She has created her own integrative approach, Body-Mind-Spirit Intervention, and is co-author of Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work (2009). \"This approach puts an emphasis on harmony and balance of the five elements in the body - metal, earth, water, air and wood. It also represents different types of internal organs, mood states and virtues, so we can enhance our resilience,\" says Chan.

Alison Tait, a fitness professional who teaches at Barre 2 Barre in Central, Hong Kong, sees a clear two-way link between mind and body. She begins her classes, whether it's a mixed barre class or a high-intensity class, with stillness, to give clients a few moments to go within and set an intention for what they hope to achieve in the session. \"I want clients to get a sense of [the class] being a reward and feeling refreshed and renewed rather than a punishment,\" says Tait. On days when she is overloaded and her brain feels \"fuzzy\", she now knows that exercise is a great remedy. \"If I'm having an off day, I respond well to putting myself through intense challenges. It can help resettle the energies in my body,\" says Tait.
