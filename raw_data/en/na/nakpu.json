The decision to get inoculated was simple, but also steeped in this country's dark colonial past. \"There was an introduction of measles and smallpox as part of the colonisation of our country, and then the Spanish flu pandemic hit Australia and heavily impacted on the Aboriginal community,\" he said. \"There's a sense of learning from history and not letting this virus hit us the way other diseases have.\" New data released by the federal government this week has painted a picture of the widening gap between fully vaccinated Indigenous Australians and the overall population, raising concerns about the impact COVID-19 will have on First Nations people if Australia eases restrictions once 70 or 80 per cent of adults are vaccinated. In Western Australia, just six per cent of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are fully inoculated, compared with 23 per cent of the entire WA population. In NSW, where the state is dealing with a serious COVID-19 outbreak, fewer than 11 per cent of Indigenous people have received two doses of the vaccine, compared with 27 per cent of the entire NSW population as of last Wednesday. The only heartening statistics are from Victoria, where the rate of Indigenous people who have been fully vaccinated, at 43 per cent, is almost double that of the Victorian population, which stands at 26 per cent. While 73 per cent of First Nations people have received their first dose, compared with 45 per cent of the rest of the Victorian population. The federal government releases weekly data on the number of Aboriginal people who have received a vaccine but does not reveal the proportion of the Indigenous population which has been inoculated. The Age calculated the data comparing the Department of Health figures against the Australian Bureau of Statistics population figures. \"It's important to be vaccinated from a physical point of view, but from an emotional and spiritual point of view ... I didn't want to be a victim, and I wanted to own my destiny and not wait to get sick,\" Uncle Alan said. The federal government's COVID-19 vaccination program has suffered multiple setbacks, including disruptions to global supply and the shifting advice to young people on AstraZeneca. However, with more Pfizer and Moderna - the preferred vaccines for Australians aged under 60 - coming into Australia, the Commonwealth announcing its four-phase plan towards COVID-19 normal, and the country racing to get vaccinated amid widespread outbreaks across the eastern seaboard, Australia could fully inoculate 80 per cent of its population by the end of this year, according to the federal government. Questions remain over when the total Indigenous population will reach the 80 per cent vaccination target set out by national cabinet, what lifting restrictions would mean for thousands of unvaccinated First Nations people, and why the rollout for this vulnerable community has been so slow. Australia's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indigenous community had been relatively successful. But as the [virus rages in NSW](https://www.theage.com.au/national/nsw/it-is-urgent-indigenous-vaccine-gap-widens-as-western-nsw-hits-new-covid-record-20210825-p58luo.html), and with low vaccination rates among First Nations people, Aboriginal communities are fearing the worst. [COVID-19 is running rampant in western NSW among the Indigenous population. ](https://infogram.com/1pdplr2y7q5jdkcme9ml1jrd7mskmnqyjz0?live) A different picture has emerged in Victoria. Michael Graham is the chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service, where almost 3000 people have been vaccinated. Back in February 2020, when the world was watching as Italy and China grappled with the novel coronavirus and remained unsure whether it would constitute a pandemic, the service told the Aboriginal community, \"this virus is going to be a thing\". The organisation, the second oldest Aboriginal health service in the country, published information and advice to its community throughout the crisis. As momentum gained around the COVID-19 vaccination earlier this year, Graham said the service was again on the front foot with information about the jabs, first and foremost encouraging health literacy among its community. \"When we do our inductions with staff, we tell our staff that any Aboriginal person who walks through this door is an owner of this organisation and needs to be treated as such ... There was a 91-year-old who came in recently and she said 'I haven't been to VAHS since the 80s, and I walked in for the first time to get my COVID vaccination and I was treated like royalty. Aboriginal community-controlled organisations have been embedded in their communities for decades, providing not just cultural support but one-stop health shops. So when a public health crisis emerged last year, the organisations already had the health authority to disseminate information. Staff visited Aboriginal people in their homes, distributed information via social media and telephone calls, equipped people with all the material on the virus and the vaccine to educate them, created rap music videos about COVID-19, and most importantly, Graham says, they have been embedded in their communities. Health behaviour researchers have consistently argued for tailored public health messaging, while community leaders repeatedly cautioned government officials about the challenges faced by some communities in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. A peer-reviewed Sax Institute [report](https://www.phrp.com.au/issues/march-2021-volume-31-issue-1/covid-19-communication-for-cald-communities/), published in March this year, unpacked the challenges experienced, and solutions offered, by culturally and linguistically diverse community (CALD) leaders in communicating health information throughout the pandemic. Although the First Nations people are not part of the CALD community, the researchers honed in on a strategy that, Graham says, has always been embraced by his service: \"achieving desirable behaviours in a target population is accomplished by understanding the needs of the population and the barriers and enablers to behaviour change.\" And that is why the service is urging the state and federal governments to step in with a funding boost for a mobile vaccination van. \"All those who are willing and ready to be vaccinated are coming in, but there's still going to be some who are a little bit afraid of coming out of their houses still, and we're a little bit concerned for them,\" Graham said. \"I've been speaking with the state government for 12 months about getting a mobile van to go to homes and gathering places and vaccinate there. We haven't been able to get support, and this is a great idea, but we're hoping that will come through at some stage, otherwise I'm worried those people won't come out to get vaccinated.\" Professor Catherine Chamberlain, a trawlwoolway woman from the University of Melbourne's Centre for Health Equity told The Age that achieving 100 per cent vaccination rates in Indigenous communities was unrealistic. \"Well, the problem is you can't force people. People want to choose so there's always going to be people who refuse,\" she said. Chamberlain also stressed the urgency of inoculating Indigenous youth had previously been overlooked in rollouts of the vaccinations scheme. \"We've got a higher proportion of our community that are young, very young, and under the vaccinatable age. So we need higher vaccination rates to account for that, as well as the higher transmissibility because of overcrowding in housing. \"I would describe that need as very urgent, given our age distribution has a higher proportion of children. Seventy to 80 per cent for us wouldn't be good.\" In the north-west of the state, the Mallee District Aboriginal Service in Mildura has stepped-up its vaccination drive after recently being guaranteed as much Pfizer as it can administer. The service is vaccinating all-comers, with restrictions lifted on administering Pfizer to people over 60 and to Indigenous children from 12-years-old, chief executive Jacki Turfrey, a palawa woman, said. \"The Delta strain outbreak on the New South Wales side [Wilcannia] was fairly close to us. It certainly got people motivated to come in and get vaccinated. So we've stepped up with the imminent risk of that coming across into Victoria,\" said Turfrey. \"We're vaccinating everyone we can. We're prioritising any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, any local mob and visitors who want to get vaccinated. They get priority bookings because our first goal, of course, is to get our own mob vaccinated as quickly as we can. But then we're opening up our administration and the vaccines to everyone else, so we're absolutely smashing through the numbers.\" The Mallee service has increased its number of clinics from three to five, running Monday to Fridays, and has vaccinated close to 3000 members of the community since March, with 2525 booked in to September 14. In Shepparton, the site of Victoria's fastest growing COVID-19 cluster last week, the Rumbalara Aboriginal Health Service clocked around 1000 tests between mid-morning Saturday and Wednesday afternoon. This level of community participation stood in contrast to attendance at the regional city's mainstream testing facilities. On Thursday, Goulburn Valley Health chief executive Matt Sharp [called](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/cases-tipped-to-rise-in-shepparton-as-authorities-call-for-more-testing-20210826-p58m90.html?btis) for more people to come forward and seek coronavirus tests. Wemba Wemba - Jaara woman, Shannon Drake, the executive manager of the Rumbalara Health Service, attributed the engagement to the effective messaging campaign from the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation from the earliest days of the pandemic and the holistic model the service applies to community health. \"In mainstream, you go in and you get your swab and it's very clinical. With us, you're coming in and you're having a yarn and we're dealing with your mental health, we're dealing with your social health, we're dealing with your spiritual health, as well as giving the swab test,\" said Drake. Like VAHS, Drake plans to establish a mobile vaccination clinic to meet the needs of community, which will complement the drive-through and mobile testing service Rumbalara implemented last weekend. \"The drive-through has made it really, really easy for the community. We actually had an elder come in on the weekend in a taxi just to make sure that they got tested. So when we identified that, I then made a plan, any vulnerable people like elders, we will actually go to them. We don't want to have any barriers preventing people from getting tested and vaccinated.\" Another key component of the Rumbalara model is providing a culturally appropriate environment to encourage the community to engage with the clinic, which involved asking Indigenous medical practitioners around the state to volunteer their time and assist on the ground in Shepparton. Last week, Drake, though the Indigenous peak health organisation, put out a call for First Nations medical staff to lend a hand. Aboriginal nurses Shanaz Rind, her sister Naz, and their cousin Banok answered the call, travelling to Shepparton from Melbourne early on Saturday. They conducted swab tests over the entirety of the weekend and will return twice more over the coming fortnight to help administer vaccines. \"Good people came out. We had good laughs. It's a big difference when you're getting swabbed by a non-Aboriginal person, compared to an Aboriginal person. We need more Aboriginal nurses out here and doing the work for mob, to make us feel safe and comfortable to come out for testing and to get vaxxed,\" said Rind. COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar, who has been overseeing Victoria's vaccination rollout, puts Victoria's success down to something really simple, but potent: strong partnerships. \"I can't comment on what other states are doing, but what we see here is a really strong partnership between Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations, local GPs and primary health networks, and state-run clinics,\" Weimar said. \"We've all worked together to get vaccination into every corner of our state from the beginning when we started the vaccination program back in February.\" The federal Department of Health in a statement said: \"Efforts in Victoria to vaccinate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been very strong and uptake has been high, in part driven by outbreak situations throughout the year. We are seeing similar strong increases in NSW vaccination rates currently.\" Uncle Alan is unequivocal in his advice to Aboriginal people across the country. \"Most people would call it mental health - for us our mental health is connected to our emotional and spiritual wellbeing. Being vaccinated has given me that spiritual boost about doing something well and doing something right and being empowered to overcome something which is trying to hurt me,\" he says. \"When you're vaccinated you're less likely to get COVID, you're less likely if you get it to be very sick, and most importantly you're less likely to transmit it. If anything motivates us, this should be it.\" Stay across the most crucial developments related to the pandemic with the Coronavirus Update.
