By helping the liver break down fats during digestion and by promoting flushing of the kidneys, the herbs in this tea gently support the body's ability to carry away wastes. Pleasantly mild, bittersweet, and earthy, this tea is a classic European herbal combination of burdock root, stinging nettle and cleavers blended with lemon myrtle for a lemony-citrus taste. Burdock - is traditionally used in herbal medicine as an alternative to help remove accumulated waste products from the body. Stinging nettle - is used in herbal medicine as a nutritive tonic. This product is non-GMO, organci and naturally caffeine free. * Each box comes with 20 wrapped tea bags. "}
