The government and medical system insist that they stop the spread of disease, whilst those opposed to vaccination insist they have the potential to result in autism, autoimmune disease, nervous system disorders and compromised immunity.](https://nepeannaturopathic.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mum-baby-vaccs.jpg) Who's right? Since the dawn of the vaccination era in the 18th century, immunisation has been touted as the saviour from smallpox, whooping cough, polio, measles and many others. The eradication of several infectious diseases appear to be undeniable proof that this is the case. However, many would argue that with improved sanitation and quarantine procedures, it is likely these illnesses would have been controlled anyway. Research conducted by a doctor in the UK has uncovered data showing that infection and mortality rates were already in decline before vaccinations were provided to the general public. Government statistics only supply data from the 1940's onwards, but the graph below clearly shows a sharp decline in whooping cough mortalities before the vaccine was introduced in the 1960's. Unfortunately, this trend in government reporting is common and rarely provides a complete picture. Source: Rodgers, A. The Doctor Who Beat The British General Medical Council By Proving That Vaccines Aren't Necessary To Achieve Health. www. collective-evolution.com, March 15, 2015. Risk vs benefit. These days, vaccination is necessary in order for children to attend childcare, kinder and school. The general consensus is that people who do not do so are selfish and risk the health of not only their own children, but others they come into contact with as well. Tony Abbott plans to implement legislation that will prevent parents getting certain welfare payments if they do not vaccinate their children. Many see this as a severe restriction of both freedom and choice. When children are vaccinated in Australia, health professionals warn parents to make sure they avoid any sick or immunocompromised friends or relatives, due to the risk of the child transmitting the very disease they have been vaccinated for. This is a fact not commonly known - there is a very real threat of vaccinated individuals spreading disease. \"How does this happen?\" you might ask. A \"live\" vaccine provides live antigenic material attached to an inert virus which stimulates the immune system to create antibodies, giving the body a ready-made memory of the infection. The illness is never meant to be real, but it can end up this way. In turn, the infected person can then pass this on to others. Live virus vaccinations in Australia include the MMR (measles, mumps pox rotavirus. [[1]](#_ftn1) What if we're misusing vaccines like we've misused antibiotics, creating far worse diseases and compromised immune function in the process? Antibiotics were promoted as the medication that would save us from all bacterial infections. Little did we know that bacterial resistance in this century might result in a return to the dark ages of medicine, where a simple infection can kill. The fear is the same with vaccinations. There are reports that the whooping cough bacteria are evolving faster than we were prepared for and are becoming resistant to the vaccines. Viruses commonly mutate far more frequently and are extremely unpredictable. The low effectiveness of the flu vaccine is a prime example of this. [[2]](#_ftn2) The other point to note is that vaccines are not a guarantee of avoiding infection. 70% of whooping cough cases occur in those who have been vaccinated [[3]](#_ftn3). Medical experts say that the infection is instead likely to be limited, with a reduction in symptoms and severity. Freedom of choice Only time will tell what the ultimate outcome of this debate will be. Advocates of immunisation will argue that it is the only way to avoid deadly outbreaks of disease. Anti-immunisation advocates will argue that the best way to avoid disease is to limit vaccinations for our children and focus on pro-active ways to support immunity, like ensuring optimal nutrition. Be informed, do the research, but ultimately the decision should be yours. "}
