NCAA Student-Athletes: If you plan to participate in intercollegiate athletics, you will be required to complete additional forms and a medical clearance process per NCAA bylaws. You should receive separate communication from your coach or the Caltech Athletics staff prior to August 1 with steps of how to complete the items required in order to attend any team activities. Any questions can be directed to your coach, or Joe Jordan, Assistant Athletic Director of Intercollegiate Operations at [jjordan@caltech.edu](mailto:jjordan@caltech.edu). Before accepting the rigors of any organized sport, student-athletes must complete a medical clearance process, including an annual Pre-Participation Evaluation by a physician. All information and instructions will be emailed to student-athletes by the Sports Medicine Staff in June of each year. The physical evaluation must be completed on the Caltech-specific history and evaluation form (found in the summer Sports Med email or on the [athletics website](https://gocaltech.com/sports/2022/8/23/information-Student-Resources.aspx)) and needs to be conducted by a medical doctor (MD) or doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) who is licensed and in good standing in their state. The evaluation must be executed after May 1 of the year leading up to participation; older exams will not be accepted. Currently, athletic physicals cannot be completed at the Caltech Student Wellness Services. Please contact your primary care physician or the Sports Medicine Staff if you need assistance with finding a physician. Any questions about medical clearance can be directed to your coach or the Sports Medicine Staff at [sportsmed@caltech.edu](mailto:sportsmed@caltech.edu).
