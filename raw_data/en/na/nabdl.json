It's based on the belief that the human body is a complex system with innate ability to heal itself. In the Naturopathic Medical model, health and disease are seen as manifestations of complex interactions among physical, spiritual, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, and social factors in the patient's life. Symptoms are not the cause of disease but expressions of the body's attempt to heal itself. Naturopathic Medicine at the Raby Institute At the Raby Institute, our Naturopathic doctors adhere to the principles of Naturopathic Medicine: - Let Nature heal - Identify and treat the underlying cause - Do no harm - The physician as teacher - Treat the whole person - Prevention We can promise an in-depth look at your lifestyle and health concerns, led by compassionate and highly trained professionals. Our Naturopathic doctors empower their patients to use diet, exercise, lifestyle changes and natural therapies (such as botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, homeopathic medicine, and hydrotherapy) to enhance the body's innate ability to ward off and combat disease. Ultimately, in naturopathic medicine, it is the patient, not the doctor, who creates or accomplishes healing. Meet Our Providers We invite you to schedule an appointment with our Naturopathic "}
