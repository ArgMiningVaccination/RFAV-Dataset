Treatment of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) with QR448(a) reduced the virus titer as measured in two laboratory host systems, Vero E6 cells and embry-onating eggs. The effect of QR448(a) on IBV in chickens was also investigated. Administering QR448(a) tochickens at a 1:20 dilution by spray, 2 h before challenge with IBV was determined to be the most effectivetreatment. Treatment decreased the severity of clinical signs and lesions in the birds, and lowered theamount of viral RNA in the trachea. Treatment with QR448(a) protected chickens for up to 4 days post-treatment from clinical signs of disease (but not from infection) and decreased transmission of IBV overa 14-day period. Anti-IBV activity of QR448(a) was greater prior to virus attachment and entry indicatingthat the effect is virucidal. In addition, QR448(a) had activity against both Massachusetts and Arkansastype IB viruses, indicating that it can be expected to be effective against IBV regardless of serotype. Toour knowledge, this is the rst report on the in vivo use of a virucidal mixture of compounds effective against the coronavirus IBV. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus, causes a highly contagious upper-respiratory tract disease in chickens. It canalso be found in other species of birds The virus is worldwide in distribution causing huge economic losses to the poultry industrythat result from a reduction in feed conversion and weight gain,and condemnations at the processing plant ( Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008 ). Losses are also due to drops in egg production and poor egg quality in layer type chickens, and for some strains of the virus thatare nephropathogenic extensive mortality can occur ( Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008 ). Infectious bronchitis virus, presents unique challenges regard- ing its control in commercial chickens. Genomic diversity and the Abbreviations: CPE, cytopathic effects; EID polymorphism; RT-PCR, specic pathogen free; TCID 50, 50% tissue to rapidly change have created different serotypes of the virus that do not cross protect ( Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008 ). Consequently, attenuated live vaccines, used to control the disease,must be selected specically for the serotype of IBV present in theflock. Compounding this situation is the presence of serologicallydifferent variant strains for which no vaccines exist. We were interested in exploring alternative methods of con- trolling IBV that could potentially be effective across all serotypes.Antiviral compounds have been used to target proteins involved incoronaviral replication. Coronaviruses have a single stranded pos-itive sense RNA genome that is approximately 27.5 kb in lengthfor IBV. During coronavirus replication, a 3 /primenested set of subge- nomic viral mRNAs are produced by the viral RNA-dependentRNA-polymerase, and four structural proteins are translated bythis enveloped virus: spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocap-sid Two large genes, 1a and 1ab from the genomic viral RNA encode the viral-replication complex. Thosegenes are translated into polyproteins that are processed by themain protease (M pro) as well as a papain-like protease 2 (PL2) to form the viral polymerase and associated nonstructural proteins(Ziebuhr et al., 2007 ). The main protease of coronaviruses appears to be the most attractive target for antiviral compounds ( Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006; Niu et al., al., 2008; Yang et al.,2005, 2006 of M proinclude a Michael acceptor inhibitor 0168-1702/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2010.01.006M.W. Jackwood et al. / Virus Research 149 (designated N3), chloromethyl ketones, epoxides, and AG7088 shown to effective against the rhinovirus Mprohomolog (Anand et al., 2003; Niu et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2008 ). Other antiviral compounds like hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) target ion chan-nel conductance, and have been shown to have an antiviral effectagainst human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E and mouse hepatitis virus(MHV) coronavirus in vitro (Wilson et al., 2006 ). In addition, specic inhibition of IBV has been reported in vitro using lithium chlo- ride ( Harrison et al., 2007 ). However, lithium chloride is a toxin and its usefulness as an antiviral against IBV in vivo remains to be determined. A major problem surrounding antiviral compounds target- ing specic viral genes or proteins is the ability of the virus torapidly mutate during replication to become resistant. Some exam-ples include acyclovir resistant human immunodeciency virusesand al., 2008 ), oseltamivir resistant influenza viruses ( Collins et al., 2008 ), and nucleo- side/nucleotide analog resistant hepatitis B viruses ( Delaney and Borroto-Esoda, 2008 ). Alternatively, compounds that have a viru- cidal effect work like a disinfectant, and do not require replicationto inactivate the virus ( Reichling et al., 2005; Schuhmacher et al., 2003 ). Thus, resistance to virucidal compounds due to muta- tions generated in the viral genome during replication is unlikely(Schnitzler et al., 2007 ). Virucidal activity of essential oils from botanicals has been reported for a number of viruses including her-pes simplex virus, dengue virus, and Junin virus al., 2005; et al., 2008; Schnitzler et al., 2007 ). Virucidal activity of essential oils, which are lipophilic by nature, is probably due todisruption of the viral membrane or interference with viral enve-lope proteins involved in host cell attachment. Although selectionof resistant mutants is possible, it has been reported that inacti-vation of virus by lipophilic essential oils is time dependent andthat infectious virus remaining after treatment are still sensitiveto the essential oils making selection of resistant mutants unlikely(Schnitzler et al., 2007 ). In this study we examined the effect of a natural based product consisting of a synergistic blend of botanical oleoresins and essen-tial oils in a liquid emulsion designated QR448(a) against IBV in vitro and in vivo . To our knowledge this is the rst report on the viruci- dal activity of botanical extracts against a coronavirus in vivo . The data are important because these types of compounds might also beuseful to control other coronaviruses like the Severe Acute Respira-tory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as well as other envelopedviruses like avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Viruses and virus propagation Strains of IBV used in this study are; the Vero cell adapted Beaudette strain (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,Rockville, MD) VR-22), the pathogenic Massachusetts 41 (Mass41)strain Health, Millsboro in Vero cells (CRL-1586),and the Mass41 ArkDPI strains specic pathogen (SPF) 10-day-old embryonating chicken (Sunrise using ( Gelb and Jackwood, 2008 ). The Vero E6 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collec-tion (Rockdale, MD) and propagated in Minimum Essential Medium(Eagle) with 2 mM l-glutamine, 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1.0 mM pyruvate, and 10% fetalbovine serum (Invitrogen Corp CO 2.2.2. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR for IBV Viral RNA was extracted with the MagMAX-96 RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol,using a KingFisher magnetic particle processor (Thermo Scientic,Waltham, MA). Real-time RT-PCR was conducted using a SmartCycler II Sunnyvale, CA) and the AgPath-ID TMOne-Step RT-PCR Callison et al., 2006 ) and consist of a for- ward primer IBV5 /primeGU391 (5/prime-GCT TTT GAG C-BHQ1-3/prime). RT-PCR DNA (Coralville, IA), andthe Taqman \u00aeprobe was obtained from BioSearch Technologies (Novato, CA). Components of the real-time RT-PCR test and thethermocycler parameters were previously described, and a stan-dard curve for the assay, was used to calculate the approximategenome copy number for each sample ( Callison et al., 2006 ). 2.3. Birds and housing Chicks were hatched from SPF fertile leghorn chicken eggs (Sun- rise Farms, Inc.) at the Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center(College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, GA).Meat-type commercial broiler chickens were obtained from Harri-son Poultry (Bethlehem, GA). For each experiment, the chicks wererandomly divided into different groups, and housed in positive-pressure Horsfal isolation units or on litter in 10 /prime\u00d710/primecolony houses. Feed and water were given ad libitum . 2.4. Experimental design The experiments described below were designed to determine the effect of QR448(a) obtained from Quigley Pharma, Inc. a sub-sidiary of the Quigley Corporation (Doylestown, PA), on IBV in vitro and in vivo . QR448(a) is a synergistic blend of botanical oleoresins and essential oils in a liquid emulsion of pharmaceutical gradeexcipients. The exact composition of QR448(a) is available fromQuigley Pharma, Inc. 2.4.1. Experiment 1: effect of QR448(a) on IBV in vitro Toxicity of QR448(a) on Vero E6 cells, and embryonating eggs was examined. Then, the minimum effective dose of QR448(a)against IBV propagated in those laboratory systems was deter-mined. The Vero E6 cells were grown to 85% confluence in a T75flask (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and transferred to two96-well plates (BD Biosciences). When the cells reached 90% con-fluence the media was removed and 100 /H9262l of undiluted and each of the10-fold dilutions of QR448(a) or the diluent (Quigley Pharma,Inc.) prepared in cell culture maintenance medium (containing 1%fetal bovine serum) was added to each of 4 different wells. Controlwells receiving cell culture maintenance medium only were alsoincluded in the experiment. The cells were incubated for 7 days at37 C and 5% CO 2and examined twice daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). The experiment was repeated 3 times. Specic pathogen free fertile chicken eggs were obtained from Sunrise farms (Catskill, NY) and incubated at 37C for 10 days. The embryonated eggs were inoculated in the chorioallantoic sac with100/H9262l of undiluted and each of the 10-fold dilutions of QR448(a) or the diluent prepared in PBS (pH 7.4). Four eggs were inoculated witheach dilution and the experiment was repeated 3 times. Negativecontrol eggs that received PBS only were also included. The eggswere incubated at 37 C and candled daily for 7 days to record mor- tality. Any mortality occurring within the rst 24 h was considered88 M.W. Jackwood et al. / Virus Research 149 (2010) 86-94 to be due to trauma associated with inoculation and disregarded. On the 7th day, all the remaining eggs were chilled to 4C and opened to examine the embryos for clinical signs of toxicity. To test the effect of QR448(a) on IBV propagated in Vero E6 cells, a constant amount of virus, 1 \u00d710350% tissue culture infec- tious dose (TCID 50) of the Beaudette strain of IBV was added to seven 10-fold serial dilutions beginning with a dilution of 1 \u00d7103 (determined to be nontoxic for the Vero E6 cells) of QR448(a) or the diluent prepared in cell culture maintenance medium. The mix-tures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min then nine10-fold serial dilutions (in maintenance medium) of each mixturewere prepared for inoculation onto cells. The cell culture media wasremoved from the cells in a 96-well tissue culture plate and themixtures were inoculated onto the monolayers. Negative controlwells receiving cell culture maintenance medium only were alsoincluded in the experiment. The cells were incubated for 7 days at37 C and 5% CO 2and examined twice daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). The experiment was repeated 3 times. The experimental design to test the effect of QR448(a) on IBV grown in embryonating eggs was the same as above, except thatthe beginning concentration of QR448(a) and the diluent was undi-luted since neither compound was toxic for the embryos. A constantamount of virus, 1 \u00d710 450% embryo infectious dose (EID 50)o ft h e IBV Beaudette strain, was mixed with undiluted and each of the10-fold dilutions of QR448(a) or the diluent prepared in PBS. Neg-ative control eggs that received PBS only were also included. Themixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min then nine10-fold serial dilutions (in PBS) of each mixture were prepared and200/H9262l of each dilution was inoculated into the chorioallantoic sac. Four eggs were inoculated for each dilution incubated at 37 C and candled daily for 7 days to record mortality. Since mortality occur-ring within the rst 24 h could be due to trauma associated withinoculation, they were disregarded. On the 7th day, all the remain-ing eggs were chilled to 4 C and opened to examine the embryos for lesions, and the EID 50titer was calculated by the Reed and Muench method ( Villegas, 2008 ). The experiment was repeated 2 times. 2.4.2. Experiment 2: route of administration and timing of treatment in vivo Two-week-old SPF leghorn chickens were divided into 11 groups of 10 birds each and housed in Horsfal isolation units. Theundiluted QR448(a) compound was given intranasally (200 /H9262l per bird), by spray (1 ml per bird), or in the drinking water (1 ml mixedwith an equal volume of reconstituted non-fat dry milk per birdafter 1 h of water starvation to promote drinking). The spray wasdelivered with a Preval \u00aesprayer (Precision Valve Corp., Yonkers, NY) while blocking the fresh air delivery to the isolator. The Preval\u00ae spray applicator consists of a 475 ml rellable reservoir and a com-pressed air power unit. Although not directly measured, the averageparticle size for this type of sprayer is in the range that would bedeposited in the naso-oro-pharyngo-laryngeal region of the res-piratory tract ( Phalen and Mendez, 2009 ). The spray treatment lasted approximately 10 s and fresh air was resumed 10 min fol-lowing treatment. For each of the delivery methods, QR448(a) wasadministered to the birds at either 6 h before challenge, 2 h beforechallenge, or 2 h after challenge. Two non-treated groups of birdsserved as a challenged control and a non-challenged negative con-trol. All of the treated birds and one of the non-treated groups were challenged with 1 \u00d710 4EID 50of the pathogenic Mass41 strain of IBV per bird. The challenge virus was given intranasally and thebirds were examined twice daily for clinical signs of the disease.At 5 days post-challenge the birds were killed and necropsied. Atnecropsy, tracheal swabs were collected and placed in ice cold PBS.The presence of virus was determined by extracting RNA directlyfrom the PBS, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR was conducted onthe RNA. Clinical signs and gross lesions were recorded and tracheas were harvested for histopathology. Clinical signs were scored as fol-lows: 1 = normal, 2 = watery eyes or mucus in the nares, 3 = wateryeyes and mucus in the nares, and 4 = watery eyes, mucus in thenares and routinely processed into parafn, and for hematoxylin and staining. Epithelialhyperplasia, lymphocyte inltration, and the severity of epithelialdeciliation were scored for each trachea with 1 being normal and 4being severe. 2.4.3. Experiment 3: minimum effective dose in vivo For this experiment, 2-week-old SPF leghorn chickens were divided into 20 groups of 10 birds each and housed in Horsfal isola-tion units. Half of the birds were treated 2 h before challenge and theother half were treated 2 h after challenge. The birds were treatedwith either undiluted or a 2-fold serial dilution of preparedin distilled deionized water, 1 ml/bird was delivered viaspray with a Preval \u00aesprayer (Precision Valve Corp.) as described in Experiment 2. Additional control groups of 10 birds each includedin the experiment were birds that were not treated and challenged(challenge control group), birds treated by the spray route withundiluted QR448(a) and not challenged, and birds that were nottreated and not challenged (negative control group). All of the treated birds unless otherwise indicated above and one of the non-treated groups were challenged with 1 \u00d710 4EID 50of the pathogenic Mass41 strain of IBV per bird as described in Experiment2. All of the birds were examined for clinical signs, and necropsied5 days post-challenge as described for Experiment 2. Clinical signswere scored as described above. 2.4.4. Experiment 4: duration of the effect in vivo For this experiment 290 1-day-old commercial broiler chickens that were not vaccinated, were divided into different groups andhoused in Horsfal isolation units. Serum was collected from severalbirds at the beginning of the experiment to determine the level ofmaternal antibodies to IBV. Antibodies were detected using a com-mercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test (IDEXX,Inc., Westbrook, ME). The birds were treated with a 1:20 dilution ofQR448(a) in sterile distilled deionized water by spray with a Preval \u00ae sprayer (Precision Valve Corp.) then challenged with 1 \u00d7103.5EID 50 of the Mass41 strain of IBV at 2 h, 6 h, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days and 7 days after treatment. The birds were challenged intranasally asdescribed in Experiment 2. Controls included birds that were nottreated and challenged at those times, and a negative group thatwas not treated or challenged. Birds challenged at 2, 4, 6, and 12 h were necropsied on the same day, 5 days after challenge, along with one non-treated/non-challenged control group. Birds challenged at 1, 2, 4, and 7 days aftertreatment were necropsied along with a negative (non-challenged)control group at 5 days after each of those challenge times. All ofthe birds were scored for clinical signs, and necropsied as describedabove. 2.4.5. Experiment 5: effect of QR448(a) on transmission of IBV in vivo In this experiment, 240 commercial broiler chickens that were not vaccinated, were equally divided and housed in two 10 /prime\u00d710/prime colony houses on pine shavings on the floor. Colony houses were used so an adequate number of birds could be main-tained together for the transmission experiment and to mimicas closely as possible commercial chicken house conditions. At2 weeks of age 20 birds from each house were removed andwing-banded (for future identication) and given a full dose ofmodied live IBV Arkansas type vaccine in the eye according to theM.W. Jackwood et al. / Virus Research 149 (2010) 86-94 89 manufacturers recommendations (Intervet, Schering-Plough Ani- mal Health, Millsburo, DE). The birds were held in isolation for2 h before reintroducing them back into the colony houses. Imme-diately after reintroducing the birds into the colony houses, allof the birds in one house were treated by spray using a Preval \u00ae sprayer (Precision Valve Corp.) with 1 ml of a 1:20 dilution (in ster-ile deionized-distilled water) of QR448(a) per bird. We monitoredthe transmission of the virus to contact exposed birds by removingand swabbing the trachea of 25 birds at 3, 7, 10 and 14 days post-treatment. We also removed and swabbed 5 birds given the vaccineat each sample time. Birds that were swabbed were removed fromthe experiment to avoid promoting the spread of the virus by induc-ing damage to the trachea and to prevent swabbing the same birdtwice during the experiment. Virus detection in the tracheal swabswas determined by real-time RT-PCR. Serum was collected from 10 birds at the beginning of the experiment (2 weeks of age) to determine the level of maternalantibodies to IBV. In addition, we collected sera from all of the birds(n= 12) necropsied on the last day of the experiment and tested them for antibodies to IBV, Newcastle disease virus, and infectiousbursal disease virus. Antibodies were tested using a commercialELISA test (IDEXX, Inc.). 2.5. Statistical analysis Virus titers were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (Villegas, 2008 ). Means and standard deviations were calculated for Ct values and analyzed statistically with Student's t-test, and the histopathological scores were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallistest coupled with Dunn's post-test, and transmission experimentdata was analyzed with Fisher's exact test using JMP StatisticalDiscovery Software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). 3. Results 3.1. Experiment 1: toxicity of QR448(a) in cell culture and in embryonating eggs, and effect on IBV in vitro Undiluted and a 1 \u00d710 1dilution of QR448(a) was toxic to Vero E6 cells and cells inoculated with a 1 \u00d7102dilution of QR448(a) had CPE affecting about 50% of the monolayer. Cells inoculated witha1\u00d710 3dilution or higher of QR448(a) were at 7 days post-treatment. The Vero E6 cells inoculated with undiluted of the diluent had CPE in >90% of the cells, whereas cells inoculated with higher dilutions of diluent did not have anyCPE following 7 days of incubation. None of the negative controlcells had CPE. Disregarding embryo deaths within 24 h of inocu-lation, none of the embryonating eggs died during the course ofthe experiment. At 7 days post-treatment, none of the embryosthat received QR448(a) or the embryos that received diluent hadgross lesions. As expected, none of the negative control embryoshad lesions. To determine the decrease in titer of infectious virus, we exam- ined the effect of determinedby titration in Vero E6 cells and the data are presented in Fig. 1 . Treatment with QR448(a) at a 1 \u00d710 3dilution reduced the titer of from an average 1 \u00d7103.0to 1\u00d7100.8TCID 50/ml. Treat- at a from QR448(a) higher than 1\u00d7104reduced the titer of IBV. No reduction in virus titer was observed for the diluent at any dilution and, none of the cells in thenegative control wells (cell culture maintenance medium alone)had CPE (data not shown). Data showing the effect of QR448(a) on IBV (Beaudette strain) as determined by titration in embryonating eggs also measuredthe decrease of infectious virus and the data are presented in Fig. 1. Titration of IBV Beaudette strain in Vero E6 cells following treatment with 10-fold serial dilutions of QR448(a) starting at 1 \u00d7103to 1\u00d7109in cell culture maintenance medium and cell culture maintenance medium plus IBV alone (con-trol) are presented. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50) titers reflect the average of three replicates. No reduction in virus titer was observed for IBV treatedwith the diluent (data not shown). Fig. 2 . Treatment with undiluted QR448(a) reduced the titer from 1 \u00d7104to 1\u00d7101.7 \u00d7103EID 50/ml respectively. No reduction in IBV titer was observed when dilutions of QR448(a) from 1 \u00d7103to 1\u00d7107 were used or when the diluent at any dilution was used. The lesions in the embryos, were typical of those reported for IBV ( Gelb and Jackwood, 2008 ). 3.2. Experiment 2: route of administration and timing of QR448(a) treatment against IBV in vivo Clinical signs were observed in all of the Mass41 virus chal- lenged groups of birds regardless of treatment but in the intranasaland spray treated groups, fewer birds had signs and the signs weremilder, as reflected by lower average scores ( Table 1 ). Virus was detected in the birds treated by the intranasal route 6 h before chal-lenge but no virus was detected in the other intranasal treatment Fig. 2. Titration of IBV Beaudette strain in embryonating eggs following treatment with 10-fold serial dilutions of QR448(a) starting at 0 (no dilution) to 1 \u00d7107in PBS, and PBS plus IBV (control) are presented. The 50% embryo infectious dose (EID 50) titers reflect the average of two replicates. No reduction in virus titer was observedfor IBV treated with the diluent (data not shown).90 M.W.

Clinical signs were observed in all of the birds treated with QR448(a) in the water, and the clin-ical sign scores were higher than the intranasal and spray treatedbirds. Virus was detected in all but one bird (6 h before challengegroup, see Table 1 ) receiving QR448(a) in the water. Severe clin- ical signs were observed and virus was detected in all of the IBVchallenged birds that did not receive treatment. In addition, all ofthe negative control birds remained negative for clinical signs andvirus detection. Tracheas were scored as described in Section 2with 1 being normal and 4 being severe, and the birds that did not receivechallenge virus had an average lesion score of 1.06.

Birds that did not have clinical signs regardless of the group were notstatistically different from the negative control birds (data notshown).3.3. Experiment 3: minimum effective dose of QR448(a) against IBV in vivo A dose response was observed in the birds treated 2 h before Mass41 virus challenge ( Fig. 3 ). A less pronounced response was observed in birds treated 2 h after virus challenge. Virus wasdetected in the trachea of all of the challenged birds, but treat-ment with the lower dilutions of QR448(a) 2 h before challenge,had a more pronounced effect on lowering the amount of virusdetected in the trachea. In general, the clinical signs were moresevere and involved more birds at the higher dilutions or QR448(a)(see average scores, Table 2 ). Tracheas were scored as described in Section 2with 1 being normal and 4 being severe, and all of the birds given undiluted QR448(a) were scored as normal (averagescore = 1.10). Statistically lower ( p0.05) lesion scores ( Table 2 ) were observed for QR448(a) at a 1:20 dilution or lower when itwas administered by spray treatment 2 h before challenge.

The numbers of birds showing clinical signs of IBV infectionand the average clinical sign scores are shown in Table 3 . The num- ber of birds with clinical signs that were treated with QR448(a) andchallenged with Mass41 within 4 days of treatment ranged from 0to 50%. In birds challenged at 7 days after treatment, 90% of thebirds had clinical signs. At each of the sample days, we observed80-100% of the birds (78% at day 1) in the non-treated Mass41 challenge control group with clinical signs indicating that maternalantibodies did not prevent the disease. None of the non-challengedbirds had clinical signs. In general, clinical signs in the treated chal-lenged birds consisted of watery eyes or mucus in the nares withan occasional bird having both. The signs were not unlike a vaccinereaction, and were considered to be extremely mild as evidencedby the average clinical sign scores. In comparison, the non-treatedchallenged birds had more severe signs consisting of watery eyes,mucus in the nares, swollen sinuses, and excessive mucus in thetrachea resulting in tracheal rales. Challenge virus was detected in all of the challenged birds, even in the QR448(a) treated birds ( Table 4 ), indicating that there was no protection from infection. Although the data were not statisticallydifferent, QR448(a) treated birds that were challenged at 2 h, 6 h,1 day, 2 days, 4 days, and 7 days had fewer viral genome copiesthan non-treated challenge groups at those same times respec-tively. No virus was detected in the tracheas of birds that were notchallenged. Tracheas were scored as described in Section 2with 1 being nor- mal and 4 being severe, and the birds that did not receive challengevirus had a normal 1.00 average score ( Table 5 ). Birds that were not challenged did not have any appreciable lesions in the trachea,and the tracheal lesion scores in the non-challenged birds that weretreated with QR448(a) were not statistically different the non-treated, non-challenged birds ( p0.01). The tracheal lesion scores for the treated and challenged group were statistically higher thanthe non-challenged birds but were not as high as the non-treatedchallenged birds ( p0.01). The positive control (non-treated chal- all lesion scores statistically higher thanthe other groups ( p0.01). 3.5.

Transmission of IBV from vaccinated to contact exposed birds was monitored by detecting the virus in the trachea using real-timeRT-PCR and the percent of contact exposed birds positive for IBV ispresented in Fig. 4 . In the treated group, virus was not detected in the contact exposed birds at 3 and 7 days post-exposure. In the non-treated group 1 of 25 birds was positive at 7 days post-exposure. At10 days post-exposure, 1 of 24 contact exposed birds was positivein the treated group whereas 3 of 25 birds were positive in the non-treated group. At 14 days post-exposure, 1 of 25 contact exposedand treated birds was positive for virus. This is in contrast to thenon-treated group where 5 of 23 contact exposed birds were posi-tive at 14 days post-exposure. The data were statistically differentat 14 days ( p0.03) but not at any other day post-exposure. Serum collected from 10 of the nonvaccinated commercial broil- ers at 1 day of age (these are the same birds bled in Experiment 4)had an average maternal antibody titer against IBV of 2,542. Anti-bodies to IBV were not detected by ELISA ( n= 12) at 2 weeks of age when the birds were vaccinated. Serum was collected from all ofthe birds necropsied at the end of the experiment and none of thebirds were positive for antibodies to IBV, none were positive forantibodies to NDV, and two birds in the treated contact group werepositive for IBDV (average titer = 1038.5). 4. Discussion The virucidal activity of essential oils, which are lipophilic by nature, likely act to disrupt the viral membrane or interferewith viral envelope proteins involved in host cell attachment (Schuhmacher et al., 2003 ). In this report, we examined the effect of a natural based product consisting of a synergistic blend of botan-ical oleoresins and essential oils in a liquid emulsion designatedQR448(a) on IBV. The minimum effective concentration against IBVwas determined in vitro using the Beaudette strain of IBV because it is adapted to grow in cell culture. The optimal route and timingof administration, most effective dose, and the duration of effecton IBV in chickens were investigated using the widespread andpathogenic Mass41 strain of the virus. Because Arkansas vaccinetype viruses are frequently found circulating in commercial chickenflocks ( Jackwood et al., 2005 ), we also examined the effect on trans- mission of modied live Arkansas type IBV vaccine in 2-week-oldbroiler chickens. The lowest dilution of QR448(a) that did not cause toxic effects in Vero E6 cells was capable of reducing the titer from 1 \u00d710 3to 1\u00d7100.8TCID was not toxic for old embryonating eggs and reduced the titer of IBV from 1 \u00d7104 to 1\u00d7102EID 50/ml. The diluent did not reduce the titer, indicating that the oleoresins and essential oils in QR448(a) were responsiblefor the effect. Next we sought to determine if the effects of QR448(a) are bio- logically signicant in chickens infected with IBV. Both positive andnegative control groups were included in the in vivo studies how- ever; we did not include a diluent control group because, in therst experiment, the diluent was shown not to have an effect on thevirus titer. Based on clinical signs, lesions and virus detection, thebest routes of administration were determined to be intranasal andspray inoculation 2 h before challenge. In addition, it appears treat-ment intranasally or by spray 2 h after challenge was somewhatbetter than intranasal or spray treatment at 6 h before challenge.Administration of QR448(a) by water had little effect regardlessof treatment timing. Based on microscopic lesions, it appears thatQR448(a) alone does not adversely affect the epithelium of the tra-chea. It is interesting that we could not detect virus in some ofthe groups treated intranasally or by spray in this experiment. Itappears that QR448(a) reduced the titer of IBV below an infectiousthreshold. Infection often does not occur when birds are chal-lenged with 1\u00d710 2.5EID 50of the Mass41 strain of IBV (Jackwood, unpublished data). It is also possible that inhibitors to the real-timeRT-PCR reaction prevented detection; however, we were able todetect challenge virus in the other groups suggesting the presenceof inhibitors are inconsistent or that another explanation is likely.Since spray is suitable for mass application of commercial chick-ens, we used that route of administration to examine the minimumeffective dose, duration of activity, and effect on transmission of IBVin chickens. Birds treated by spray with QR448(a) 2 h before challenge showed a clear dose response between undiluted QR448(a) and adilution of 1:40 ( Table 2 and Fig. 3 ). Treatment 2 h after challenge had a less pronounced dose response, indicating that QR448(a) isless effective following virus attachment and entry into the hostM.W. Jackwood et al. / Virus Research 149 (2010) 86-94 93 cell. This data and the timing of administration data above suggests that QR448(a) activity is virucidal rather than antiviral in nature. One-day-old broiler chickens treated with QR448(a) were pro- tected from clinical signs of disease following challenge withpathogenic IBV up to 4 days post-treatment ( Table 3 ). Although maternal antibodies in chicks, which generally last from 1 to 2weeks of age, and can provide some protection against IBV ( Mondal and Naqi, 2001 ), we observed clinical signs in most of the non- treated virus challenged control birds indicating that maternalantibodies did not play a role in protection from clinical signs. Pro-tection from infection was not observed since challenge virus wasdetected in all of the QR448(a) treated and challenged birds. How-ever, at all but two challenge times (4 and 12 h) the amount ofchallenge virus in the trachea was slightly lower in the QR448(a)treated groups but the values were not statistically signicant. In aprevious study, where different amounts of IBV were given to chick-ens, it was reported that the amount of virus detected in a clinicalsample from trachea correlated with dose at 1 day post-challengebut by 5 days post-challenge all of the birds had similar levels ofvirus in the trachea regardless of challenge dose ( Callison et al., 2006 ). Treatment with QR448(a) may have lowered the amount of virus in the birds but by 5 days post-challenge when we collectedsamples, little or no differences in viral load were observed. Examining birds at 5 days post-challenge is the USDA recom- mended procedure (USDA, APHIS title 9, code of federal regulationshttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx 08/9cfrv1 08.html ) for evaluating protection from IBV challenge. Since challengevirus was detected in the trachea of the QR448(a) treated birdsit is possible that clinical signs would have been observed inmore of the treated birds if they were observed beyond 5 dayspost-challenge. It is also possible that fewer or no clinical signswould be observed in those birds beyond 5 days post-challenge,since a delay in clinical signs may represent additional time forthe birds to mount a protective immune response to the challengevirus. Protection of broiler chickens for up to 4 days post-treatment from clinical signs of disease but not from infection may providean opportunity to induce some level of local immunity due to thepresence of the challenge virus. Although we did not measure localimmunity in these studies, protecting birds from severe upper-respiratory disease with QR448(a) and at the same time allowingeld viruses to infect and induce an immune response may providea mechanism to specically protect chickens from resident eldvirus(es) regardless of the virus type. Transmission of Arkansas type IBV vaccine from infected to con- tact control pen mates was examined and we observed 22% of thenon-treated contact exposed birds positive for IBV whereas only4% of the treated contact exposed birds were positive for virusat 14 days post-exposure. Clearly QR448(a) treatment diminishedtransmission of IBV to contact exposed birds and the effect wasstatistically signicant ( p0.03). To ensure that maternal anti- bodies did not play a role in this experiment, we vaccinated thebirds at 2 weeks of age when maternal antibodies were no longerdetected. Previously reported studies have shown that Arkansas type vac- cine is the most prevalent virus in the commercial broilers and iscapable of persisting in the flock ( Jackwood et al., 2005; McKinley et al., 2008; al., 2000; van Santen and Toro, 2008 ). Vaccine virus was used in this experiment because colony houses (necessary tohouse the number of birds needed for the experiment) are not bio-logically secure, preventing us from using pathogenic isolates ofIBV. Although this experiment was designed to be a model for theprevention of spread of pathogenic IBV isolates, the data directlyaddress an extremely important problem of Arkansas vaccine viruspersistence in commercial broiler flocks. Persistence of IBV in a flockcan cause a severe vaccine reaction and provides opportunity forthe vaccine virus to mutate and revert to pathogenicity as well as change antigenically avoiding the immune response of the bird. Areduction in transmission afforded by treatment with QR448(a) isextremely important since it will limit IBV transmission in the flock,and likely lessen or even prevent persistence of Arkansas vaccinevirus in flocks. Since QR448(a) is effective against the pathogenicMass41 strain of IBV it is expected that it will also limit transmis-sion of pathogenic eld strains of IBV in commercial broilers andthereby decrease the severity of the disease. This is the rst report on the use of a mixture of all natural ingredients, specically botanical oleoresins and essential oils, asa control measure for IBV. Mass delivery of QR448(a) by spray iscompatible with application in a commercial setting and it is effec-tive against both Mass and Ark type IB viruses, indicating that itought to be effective against IBV regardless of serotype. The effectappears to be more pronounced on cell free virus indicating thatthe activity is likely virucidal, which is important because it mayalso be effective against other enveloped respiratory viruses likeavian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus in commercialpoultry, as well as other coronaviruses in animals and humans. Inaddition, since virucidal compounds work by inactivating viruses,rather than targeting specic virus genes or proteins, it reduces thelikelihood that resistance will develop from mutations during virusreplication.
