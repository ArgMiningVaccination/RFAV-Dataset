What Phase IV Surveillance Studies Show Scientific studies support vaccine safety, but certain individual reports don't. Which side to trust? A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the gold-standard method for testing the safety and efficacy of a drug or biologic in humans. Because of RCTs, we know that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective compared to the control group. Beyond the clinical trial's control group in the general population, however, we rely on observational studies to monitor vaccine safety and efficacy. We call this [post-licensure](https://vaccine-safety-training.org/post-licensure-vaccine-safety.html) or [post-marketing surveillance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3148611/). But as observational study design is inferior to RCT, can we trust that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective outside of the RCTs? As covering both vaccine safety and effectiveness are too extensive, I'll focus on safety, especially the most commonly used mRNA and DNA vaccines. Individual voices have raised concerns about vaccine safety. I'll not name names here, but you most probably have heard or seen articles or videos declaring that Covid-19 vaccines are dangerous. They commonly cite the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a surveillance system in the U.S. that relies on voluntary reporting from healthcare providers or patients. It's basically a collection of anecdotes, which [have been useful](/microbial-instincts/underreporting-and-post-vaccine-deaths-in-vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system-vaers-explained-14fe22b2a65f?sk=92b411e235aaec14378298672df47334) in catching vaccine-related adverse events early. So, can we still trust that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe outside of the RCTs?Yes, because several large surveillance studies conducted in the real world have shown that risks associated with vaccines are minimal, which are far lower than the risks of Covid-19. Why Phase III Clinical Trials Aren't Enough If a drug candidate works safely in cell culture and animal studies, the pharmaceutical company may apply for permission from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical trial testing on humans, [starting from](https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/drug-development-explaining-a-complicated-process-including-vaccines/) phase I to IV. Phase I clinical trial tests the drug at various doses in a small group of people to ensure and determine a safe dose. Phase II then tests if the drug works via a randomized controlled trial... "}
