This is a very holistic health and wellness concept which means a healthy mind and body plus radiant and youthful skin. We at Absolute Health have asked Khun Jik for her health and wellness tips and they are as follows: Health is a very important part of life. Just like any good investment, attaining good health is the same thing. Effort and proper attention must be given, and most importantly time must be fairly allocated. Do your best to control your moods by making yourself cheerful, reduce your stress and in addition be mindful. Firstly, do not be afraid of anything that happens in your life. You should always consider your wellbeing and take good care of yourself. Staying positive is another key factor because everyone needs and deserve happiness and it can be contagious and may at time cause a domino effect in a very positive way. Stress in turn can be a harmful causative agent to the body which can worsen a person physically and emotionally. I used to dedicate myself fully to work. Believe it or not, my career is very tiring and I never did get enough rest. I used to only have 2-3 hours of sleep each day and even then, I did not sleep well. It really effected my heath badly. For example: I had issues with my blood circulation. So therefore, I had to drink lots of water. However, no matter how much water I drank, it is never enough. I had to look into other possible avenues to take care of my health related issues. One of my greatest fear is dying and what made it worst was my work commitments. Apart from that, I've always felt nervous and intimidated whenever I visited the hospital or see the doctor for any procedure or even taking medications but now I see thing in a different light. If you ask me whether taking regular oral medication can cure a health issue, the answer is yes but it also mean that you will be reliant on mediations always. Personally, I am not a big fan of medication so that means that I have to take special care of myself. Therefore, I had to find an alternative avenue. That was when I did my due diligence and through a recommendation from a friend, I found myself in the care of Dr Chatchai and his lovely medical team in Absolute Health Integrative Medical Center. Absolute Health gave me information on preventive care and how to enhance the immunity, including holistic treatment when being sick, how to correct the disease at the root cause and how to avoid the use any form of chemical based medicaments. My personal favorite was the Quantum Scan machine, which is a holistic physical check-up that helps to assess the body function in all of the systems and organs in the body. This machine will scan your body to check its condition and the results are quicker than an actual lab test. Apart from the rapid results, it also can tell the condition of your body and the amount of toxins in it. I remembered, right after my scan was done, the staff asked if I had silver fillings because the result showed that there was a lot of lead and toxins indicated. The machine also showed that I am allergic to wheat flour or peanuts. Since then, I do not eat peanuts and avoid food with peanuts. I do get very itchy if I happen to consume foods containing the allergen mentioned. I used to think that my skin was dry and cracked, but it was not true. The simple fact was, I was not aware of my food allergy. All this while, what I ate caused inflammation in my body without me knowing it. Haematogenous Oxidation Therapy (H.O.T) was another treatment that I am glad I tried. It helped to disinfect the blood stream and enhance the immunity and also strengthen my body. 100-200 milliliter of my blood was drawn, it is then processed through oxygen and UV light, and reinjected back into my body. I was a little nervous at the start of the procedure. I have always thought that I was healthy had taken care of myself very well. But it was not true. My blood was very thick and therefore effected my blood circulation. It was a wakeup call as it also indicated that I was at risk of other diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. There and then I immediately wanted to make changes and prevent myself from being susceptible to the diseases mentioned. That was when I seriously started considering about preventive care. What I did next was the Food Allergy Test, which was to test for any reaction caused by food sensitivity. This test would help me determine the types of food I was allergic to so that I am able to avoid them. Currently, many people have food allergy problems. Some people have a reaction or allergy from smelling or skin contact. It starts from rashes and hives, which can have a great impact on one's health. There had been cases where a chronic problem was just a simple allergy through a more in-depth diagnosis. Some people have dormant allergies and at times they do not even know that fact. Other causative factors are the chemicals or flavoring agents found in ingredients plus preservatives nowadays. Apart from what was mentioned, I also realized that a lot of people have very low immunity because of the lifestyle they choose which can also effect allergic reaction. Therefore, I found the recommended Food Allergy Test was very useful and a played a pivotal role on the type of food I consume to keep me healthy and safe from any allergic reaction. More importantly, I have been studying about the basics of food intolerance. It can cause negative effects to our general heath. Some of the examples are as follow: - migraine - attention deficit disorder - nasal congestion - runny nose - chronic headache - asthma - muscle pain - abnormalities in the immune system, such as Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Another thing that has become a regular part of my life now is exercise. I make sure I always make time to exercise whenever I am free either at home or on the set. I do my best to control my diet and eat only healthy food as advised by Dr Chatchai and his team. Currently, I have now become a volunteer. I do my best to give encouragement to others. I would like to pass a message to all my fellow volunteers out there. I understand being a volunteer can be a challenge. With an open heart and positive thoughts, you can and will make a difference to the lives of many people and especially to those who really need support. Your encouraging words and selfless smiles are the most natural therapy anyone can have and remember, your contributions are extremely valuable. Lastly, To Dr Chatchai and the team at Absolute Health, I sincerely appreciate this new method of treatment pathway that you have introduced to me. I feel that this is the optimal method that can make me stronger, so that I can perform at my optimal everyday with a smile. I strongly believe that everyone should make their lives better by walking towards the path of health. As we all know, nowadays, health is wealth and therefore success is nothing without great health. "}
