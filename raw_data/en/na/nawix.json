All rights reserved. This paper, prepared by the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology, is one in a series of background briefsintended to provide a non-technical introduction tovarious issues relating to genetically modified foodand agricultural biotechnology.Have Transgenes, Will Travel Issues Raised by Gene Flow from Genetically Engineered Crops Concerns surrounding the widespread commercial use of genetically modified (GM) plants gener- ally have focused on two questions: are GM plants safe to eat and do they pose dangers if theyspontaneously breed with wild relatives or conventional crops. While food safety issues havegarnered much of the attention, there is also much discussion about what could happen if trans-genic plants accidentally co-mingle with their wild and domesticated relatives. The issuerevolves around the extent to which GM plants may spread their novel traits into surroundingcrops and ecosystems via pollen or seed and just what sort of problems, if any, one mightencounter from this \"gene flow.\" Gene flow is not something peculiar to transgenic plants. In the world of living creatures, gene flow is as old as life itself. It happens any time one organism breeds with a related species, thuspassing along their combined DNA to the offspring. That said, gene flow that involves geneticallymanipulated organisms raises a new set of issues for scientists and policymakers to consider. ECOLOGICAL ISSUES. Investigators interested in fleshing out the particular risks posed by gene flow from GM plants generally are interested in the ramifications of several distinct scenarios.One widely discussed scenario among ecologists is whether a transgenic plant might breed with awild relative, and perhaps forever alter the wild plants' genetic identity. Another issue is whetherthe transgenic plant might endow a wild relative with a so-called \"fitness\" gene, making ithardier and giving it the potential to become a kudzu-like \"superweed.\" In addition, there is aseparate environmental concern related to the conveyance of pest-killing properties. While sucha trait might be desirable for a domesticated crop, could its presence in a wild plant alter theecosystem by killing off beneficial insects and soil organisms? ECONOMIC ISSUES. Somewhat separate from the analysis of these potential ecosystem effects are efforts to evaluate the economic implications of GM crops spreading their transgenes toother, conventional crops. The concern here is that if pollen or seed travels from a field of trans-genic corn to a field of conventional corn, it could hinder efforts to maintain distinct varieties ofcrops for the marketplace. This may be of particular concern if farmers are trying to grow andmarket \"GMO-free\" commodities. Meanwhile, applications on the horizon that would modify plants to make them produce pharma- ceutical or industrial products appear destined to present a new set of concerns about gene flowbetween conventional and transgenic crops.PEW INITIATIVE ON FOOD AND BIOTECHNOLOGY3Gene Flow Hits the Headlines: The Mexican Corn Controversy Scientific inquiry into the implications of gene flow from transgenics is a relatively new and still developing field of study. But it appears that the public is interested in getting some answers tothe many questions about what happens when transgenes become mobile. In late 2001 and early 2002, it became clear that gene flow from transgenics was no longer an esoteric debate of interest only to ecologists, plant geneticists, biotechnology companies and pub-lic interest groups. The watershed event was a report by David Quist and Ignacio Chapela, two sci-entists at the University of California, Berkeley, that transgenic corn had cross-pollinated with anative ancestor of corn growing in Mexico, despite the fact that Mexico had banned cultivation oftransgenic varieties. Originally published in Nature magazine, the findings were challenged widely by scientists who felt the research was flawed. Nature editors agreed and took the rare step of essentially retracting the report, claiming that upon further review there was insufficient evidenceto justify the original publication. Charges flew between both sides that criticism and support of the paper was really motivated by pro or anti-GM food agendas. But what was most confusing to many observers is that, when thedust settled \u2014 if it has indeed settled \u2014 it appeared the debate over the incident was not overwhether there was transgenic corn in Mexico. Rather, the argument focused on the methods usedby the researchers to detect its presence and on their complex scientific analysis of how the trans-genes were behaving in Mexican corn. As Science magazine noted in a March 2002 report on the incident, \"Surprisingly, even Quist and Chapela's most strident critics agree with one of their cen-tral points: Illicit transgenic maize may well be growing in Mexico.\" If, then, most parties generally agree that GM corn is growing in Mexico, the question really becomes, should we be concerned? Those alarmed about the discovery argue it is a problem because Mexico, where corn first origi- nated, is a global center of corn biodiversity. They claim that valuable strains of corn and corn'swild ancestor, teosinte, could be irrevocably altered should their genes co-mingle through cross-breeding with the DNA from the transgenic corn. At the height of the controversy, advocacygroups asked the United Nations to impose a moratorium on the cultivation of transgenics inareas deemed centers of genetic diversity. They referred to the presence of GM corn in Mexico as a\"contamination\" and said it would impose new burdens on internationally-supported seed banks maintained in Mexico. Among other things, they argued that at a minimum the ability to distrib-ute a healthy diversity of corn seed to farmers globally would be constrained by the need toscreen seed for the presence of GM traits. Others, who believe the furor unjustified, have argued there is no more reason to be concerned about the presence of transgenic corn in Mexico than there is about the fact that non-native com-mercial strains of conventionally bred corn have been grown there for decades. Countless varietiesHAVE TRANSGENES: WILL TRAVEL 4of conventionally bred corn have been growing in Mexico with no apparent harm and little or no controversy. So why, they counter, are transgenic varieties being singled out for vilification? For example, a February 2002 \"Joint Statement\" published by Agbioworld.org that was signed by more than 100 public and private sector scientists, states that \"it is important to recognize thatthe kind of gene flow alleged in the Nature paper is both inevitable and welcome.\" The statement went on to argue that the spontaneous flow of DNA from GM corn to Mexican varieties is partof a process farmers have used for thousands of years to improve their seed stock by \"plantingseeds of new varieties adjacent to old ones and then (selecting) the desired offspring while dis-carding the rest.\" These arguments have not satisfied some critics of GM crops who believe that gene flow from transgenics is qualitatively different than gene flow involving conventional crops. They claimtransgenics are inherently more threatening because the technology itself so disturbs a plant'sgenome as to make its behavior unpredictable. While the majority of scientists who have studied the issue do not support such claims, the polar- izing debate over the significance of transgenic corn's incursion into native Mexican plants high-lights the need to better understand the risks posed by gene flow from GM crops. Do Transgenics Deserve Special Consideration? No and Yes So far, most scientific inquiry into the subject has failed to support the notion that there is some-thing about the genetic engineering process itself that intensifies any threats from gene flow. In the 2002 report, \"The Environmental Effects of Transgenic Plants,\" a panel of experts assembled by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) concluded that \"the genetic engineering process, per se,presents no new categories of risk\" to the environment compared to conventional breeding. In other words, scientists are quick to point out that gene flow did not begin with transgenic plants or even agriculture, and that the kinds of risks from transgenic crops are similar to thosefrom conventionally bred crops. Naturally occurring instances of gene flow is the reason there issuch an abundant variety of related plant species. On the other hand, although the process of genetic engineering may not introduce new categories of risks, the traits introduced through biotechnology may pose different risks. As the NAS report point- ed out, \"this technology could introduce specific traits or combinations of traits that could posePEW INITIATIVE ON FOOD AND BIOTECHNOLOGY5 Scientists are quick to point out that gene flow did not begin with transgenic plants or even agriculture,and that the kinds of risks from transgenic crops aresimilar to those from conventionally bred crops. unique risks.\" Biotechnology certainly broadens the horizon of potential risks posed by gene flow, since it greatly increases the number and type of traits that can be added to individual species. Infact, it is the revolutionary ability to improve plants by infusing them with genetic material bor-rowed from a wide variety of species that sets biotechnology apart from conventional breeding. For example, through biotechnology, farmers now have access to corn and cotton that contains a gene obtained from a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis or Bt, that gives these crops the ability to produce an insect-killing toxin. One concern is that transgenic crops containing these genes couldbreed with a wild relative and in the process pass along this insect-fighting capability. If this newtrait made the resulting hybrid more \"fit,\" it could out-compete and eventually replace theunmodified wild relative. So through the age-old process of gene flow and the modern industry of biotechnology, there is the opportunity for new traits to be integrated into species where they have never been seenbefore. Furthermore, the most widely used applications currently on the market\u2014which conveysuch traits as Bt expression, herbicide resistance and protection from plant viruses\u2014are just a hintat the technology's potential. Scientists currently are experimenting with a variety of transgenictraits, such as those that would give plants the ability to survive in salty soils or harsh conditions.In many cases, seed companies will want to \"stack\" multiple traits into a single plant, furthercomplicating the assessment of environmental impacts. Breeding With Immediate Family and Consorting With Wild Relatives CROP-TO-CROP GENE FLOW. The first thing scientists must consider when studying the risks of gene flow from GM species is the likelihood that transgenic plants will move \"off the farm,\" so tospeak. Scientists generally expect that if a GM variety of a crop is grown near non-modified vari-eties, gene flow will be a fairly common occurrence. It is well known that pollen from, for example,one variety of corn (conventional or transgenic) can spread to an adjacent field containing anothervariety and create a hybrid. There are plenty of documented cases of this kind of spontaneous \"crop-to-crop\" gene flow occurring between transgenic and conventional varieties of corn and canola. The likelihood of gene flow through pollen drift will depend on the specific crop. Crops that are fertilized through wind-blown \"open\" pollination, like corn, are more likely to hybridize. Otherplants that self-pollinate, such as soybeans, will be less susceptible to gene flow problems. HAVE TRANSGENES: WILL TRAVEL 6 So through the age-old process of gene flow and the modern industry of biotechnology, there is the opportunityfor new traits to be integrated into species where theyhave never been seen before. A widely discussed instance of crop-to-crop gene flow occurred in 2000 in Canada, where discov- ered growing on the roadside and as a weed or \"volunteer\" in a farmer's field, was a variety ofcanola that, due to gene flow between different fields of canola, had come to possess resistance tothree herbicides. Two of the resistance traits were acquired from inadvertent cross breeding involv-ing genetically engineered canola plants. One was acquired from a canola plant whose herbicideresistance was produced through conventional breeding techniques. Its relatively quick emergence\u2014herbicide resistant canola has only been on the market for a few years\u2014is viewed by scientists as agood example that gene flow happens and it can happen soon after a new variety is introduced. Crop-to-crop gene flow creates two potential problems for farmers. The first concern is that the new hybrid could become a troublesome weed. For example, if a hybrid canola resistant tothree herbicides begins growing as a \"weed\" in a farmer's cornfield, it may be difficult to controlusing herbicides and would have to be mechanically removed. Some believe that this outcome isunlikely because of the availability of other herbicides. In any event, the development of weedresistance to herbicides is certainly not a new phenomenon, and has been a management issue for farmers for decades. A second concern is that gene flow from transgenic crops could pose an economic problem for growers seeking to avoid the use of genetically engineered crops for a variety of marketing rea-sons. Most notably, producers of organic food are particularly concerned about crop-to-crop geneflow involving transgenics, because in many countries, the United States and Canada amongthem, regulations regarding organic foods ban the use of biotechnology in their production orprocessing. (In the U.S., a food may still be labeled organic if it contains low levels of unintendedGM ingredients caused by gene flow, as long as the farmer followed the requirements of organicproduction, but organic food manufacturers might still insist on no GM content.) In January of2002, the Saskatchewan Organic Directorate in Canada filed suit against makers of transgeniccanola for the loss of markets because of cross-pollination between organic and GM canola crops.GM canola represents between 50 and 60 percent of all canola planted in the province. Accordingto the suit, the prevalence of GM canola makes it difficult or impossible for organic farmers toproduce GM-free canola. Even conventional farmers are concerned that GM crops may endanger some of their overseas markets. As they seek to meet market demands in countries that do not want or do not permit allGM crop varieties, some farmers are growing concerned that gene flow from GM crops in neigh-boring fields may render their crops unacceptable in those markets. For instance, the EuropeanUnion adopted new policies in July 2003 that require food and animal feed containing more than0.9 percent of GM content to be labeled as genetically modified. The possibility of gene flowmakes such a threshold potentially difficult to reach in some cases. CROP-TO-WILD RELATIVES GENE FLOW. Biologically speaking, gene flow of the crop-to-crop variety is relatively easy to understand, but what do we know about the potential of GM crops tospread their traits not just to nearby farms but into the world of wild plants.PEW INITIATIVE ON FOOD AND BIOTECHNOLOGY7The conditions must be right to result in successful cross-breeding between domesticated GM crops and wild relatives. There must be pollen drift from the GM crop, there must be wild relativesnearby to receive the pollen, and the wild relatives must be compatible enough to result in a fer-tile hybrid that contains the GM genes. Scientists are investigating these factors in determiningthe probability of gene flow from crops to wild relatives. Norman Ellstrand, an expert on plant population genetics at the University of California- Riverside, has done extensive research on the capacity of cultivated crops to distribute theirgenetic material by breeding with wild relatives. He said that even as recently as the early 1990s,the general assumption was that gene flow from crops to wild species was a rare event. This wasbased on the belief, he said, that crops had been growing in isolation from their wild relatives forso long that they simply were no longer very compatible. This was supported by anecdotal reportsfrom plant breeders that they routinely failed when trying to create hybrids by crossing a domes-ticated crop with a wild variety. But Ellstrand has found spontaneous cross breeding, and hence gene flow, between crops and their wild relatives to be a fairly common occurrence. Overall, Ellstrand reports evidence that \"atleast 44 cultivated plants mate with one or more wild relatives somewhere in the world,\" includ-ing 12 of the world's 13 most cultivated food crops. Other investigations support the notion that crop plants cross with wild relatives. Most recently, a study by the European Environment Agency examined crops widely grown on farms in theEuropean Union to assess the potential of gene flow from transgenics into wild populations. Basedon the ability of a crop's pollen to travel and its historical hybridizations, the agency concludedthat the ability to breed with a wild relative was high for oilseed, medium to high for beets andmany cultivated fruits, and low for potatoes, wheat and barley. It was nonexistent for corn for thesimple reason that Europe harbors no wild relatives of corn. It should be noted that Ellstrand's research also revealed that while many crops and their wild rel- atives do cross, not all the crosses result in fertile offspring. For example, crosses between eitherdurum or bread wheat and a wild relative of wheat result in sterile hybrids. In other cases, such aswith corn, only some of the wild relatives can cross with the crop. Furthermore, to crossbreed at all, the wild relatives have to be present near domesticated crops. The two most widely grown crops in the United States, corn and soybean, both of which are com-mercially available in GM varieties, do not have wild relatives in close proximity in this country,so gene flow from these crops into natural settings via crop-to-wild hybrids is not an issue. This isnot necessarily the case in other countries. As Ellstrand points out there are wild relatives of cornin Mexico and wild relatives of soybean in Korea and China. He said it is important to keep this inmind so crops found to pose no risk of crop-to-wild gene flow in the United States are notassumed to pose no risks in other nations. HAVE TRANSGENES: WILL TRAVEL 8Food crops in the United States with wild relatives include wheat, which can breed with a related weed called jointed goat grass. Ellstrand notes that crosses between domestic sorghum (a cropused in human and animal food products) and wild johnson grass provided genetic material thathas contributed to the weedy qualities of johnson grass, one of the world's most troublesomeweeds. In addition, for U.S. grown food crops like rice, sunflowers, alfalfa, radishes, and strawber-ries there are wild versions (i.e. wild strawberries, wild rice, some of which are intrusive weeds)that have been known to cross and produce viable hybrids with domesticated varieties. Then there are the non-food crops that have the potential to breed with wild populations. For example, cultivated cotton has been known to breed with wild cotton. Also, for farmed turf andforage grasses and trees, there is almost no difference between cultivated and wild varieties, mak-ing cross breeding that much more likely. The NAS report on transgenics and the environment notes that the research to date does not sug- gest that hybrids produced by crosses between conventional crops and wild varieties routinelycause problems. Negative consequences have been relatively uncommon, the report states, butthere have been instances in which such gene flow has done damage. For example, breedingbetween wild and domesticated sugar beets has been economically devastating to European sugarproducers because the unproductive hybrids can take over a crop and render it worthless. Hybridscreated by spontaneous breeding between wild rice and domesticated rice are blamed for theextinction of Taiwanese wild rice. \"In summary, crop-to-wild gene flow is not uncommon, and on occasion, it has caused problems,\" Ellstrand said. \"Would we expect transgenic plants to behave any differently? The answer is 'no' andthat's not necessarily good news. It is clear that the probability of problems due to gene flow fromany individual cultivar is extremely low, but when those problems are realized they can be doozies.\" Gene Flow Happens, Now What While scientists know that gene flow from crop-to-crop and from crop-to-wild relatives happens,and are working on better understanding the probabilities of such flow, the more difficult policyquestion is: so what? What is the harm of gene flow? For farmers, the problem of crop-to-crop gene flow is primarily economic. Farmers may need to find ways to manage more difficult weeds, or find ways to limit or prevent gene flow from GMPEW INITIATIVE ON FOOD AND BIOTECHNOLOGY9 \"...It is clear that the probability of problems due to gene flow from any individual cultivar is extremelylow, but when those problems are realized they canbe doozies.\"crops to crops intended for organic or non-GM markets. While these issues present new challenges, farmers may be able to respond to them by managing crops to minimize gene flow problems. The ecological harm raised by crop-to-wild relative gene flow is more difficult to assess for a number of reasons. To survive and thrive in a natural environment, the genetic trait passed on tothe new hybrid needs to give the plant a \"fitness\" advantage over the non-modified wild plant. Anew \"fitter\" hybrid could become established or even replace non-modified plants, grow in newplaces, and change ecological balances. For example, a new hybrid that retains the ability to repelpests could change the abundance or distribution of insects or soil microbes. Whether such eco-logical changes are benign, beneficial, or adverse will depend on perspectives and case-by-caseconsiderations. What do scientists know about such issues? Alan McHughen, a plant geneticist at the University of Saskatchewan who explored popular per- ceptions of biotechnology in his book \"Pandora's Picnic Basket,\" said the knowledge that gene flow between domesticated crops and wild relatives has been relatively common in the history ofagriculture should remove some of the anxiety surrounding gene flow from transgenic crops. Hebelieves a misconception inflaming the controversy about the environmental impact of transgen-ics is the mistaken belief that gene flow from crops to wild plants began with biotechnology. McHughen said there should be acknowledgement on all sides that gene flow happens with con- ventional crops, and that it is going to happen with transgenic crops. Therefore, he believes trans-genic crops, and conventional crops, for that matter, should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis,with the focus primarily on whether there is the opportunity for the crop to mate with a wildhybrid and on the potential environmental impact of the trait in question. For example, McHughen said that outside of creating problems for farmers, an herbicide resistant transgenic plant breeding with a wild relative to produce an herbicide resistant hybrid should notpose a direct threat to the environment. That's because in wild environments the hybrid is unlikelyto encounter herbicides. In this case, McHughen points out, the transgene becomes irrelevant to thewild plant. It does not give the plant any competitive advantages and, as such, would likely disap-pear over time. Gene flow in this instance should be of little consequence to the natural ecosystem. By the same token, transgenic varieties that carry genes that increase the fitness of the plant, pro- viding it with pest or disease resistance, could be of concern since such traits could be advanta-geous to a wild species. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has prohibitedplantings of transgenic Bt cotton in parts of Arizona, Southern Florida and Hawaii where condi-HAVE TRANSGENES: WILL TRAVEL 10 To survive and thrive in a natural environment, the genetic trait passed on to the new hybrid needs to givethe plant a \"fitness\" advantage over the non-modifiedwild plant.tions might be more favorable for cross-breeding between Bt cotton and wild cotton. The concern was that giving wild cotton a Bt producing gene would increase the chances of it becoming aninvasive plant. Gene flow is expected to be a major issue in the regulatory approval of transgenic crops now in the pipeline that have been engineered to endure harsh conditions, including drought and salty soil. According to Allison Snow, a plant geneticist at Ohio State University, the key issue is this: \"Whenever we have a transgene that is going to increase survivability or seed production orcould allow a plant to extend its range to places where it has not occurred before, then weshould raise a flag.\" Predicting Ecological Impacts of Gene Flow New research performed by Snow and her colleagues shows how much progress scientists havemade in illuminating the issues raised by gene flow from transgenics. But it has also put a spot-light on how difficult it is to predict the magnitude of the risks and on the many factors that caninfluence whether problems can be expected to occur. As it now stands, scientists have good data allowing them to predict which crops are likely to breed with wild relatives, some of which has been gained via a sort of DNA finger printing forplants, new technology that gives scientists the ability to trace plant lineage with incredible preci-sion. They also are defining the kinds of traits that may deserve the most attention. At the cuttingedge have been experiments that examine what happens to a transgene when a crop is allowed tobreed, in a test setting, with a wild relative. For example, Snow and her colleagues at Ohio State recently conducted an experiment where they took sunflowers that have been genetically engineered to contain a Bt gene\u2014the transgenic plantsproduce toxins lethal to insects that prey on sunflowers\u2014and crossed them with a wild sunflower.They then took the offspring or hybrid from that mating and allowed it to breed, under laboratoryconditions, with other wild sunflowers, the goal being to mimic what might happen to the trans-gene if the hybrid began breeding in natural settings. In this experimental setting, the Bt gene survived in the hybrids and remained active as the hybrid crossed with other wild sunflowers. \"We got this new kind of protection that we had never seen before in wild sunflowers and the fit- ness advantage (from the Bt gene) turned out to be very high,\" she said. As Snow explained, theBt toxin reduced the amount of insects chewing on the sunflower and allowed the wild sunflowerhybrid to make more flower heads and more seeds. PEW INITIATIVE ON FOOD AND BIOTECHNOLOGY11But how hazardous is a wild Bt expressing sunflower to the environment? \"If you start getting twice as many wild sunflowers as before, just how bad is that?\" Snow asks. \"That is the sort of big question no one knows the answer to. You could argue 'lets just move for-ward because we can't examine the effect until we do large-scale field trials.' Others would say'why do this at all since you can't recall the genes once they are out there?' So it becomes a reallysticky issue.\" Adding to the stickiness is the different outcomes that are emerging from experiments involving the mating of transgenic crops with wild relatives. For example, while Snow's experiment withsunflowers shows that gene flow from a Bt-carrying transgenic can increase the fitness of a wildplant, an experiment by Neal Stewart, a plant geneticist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville,shows that it can do the opposite as well. Stewart published a report in early 2003 on a field trial he conducted, which involved breeding transgenic oilseed rape with a wild relative. The coupling produced a hybrid, which was thenmated or \"backcrossed\" with a wild plant and released into a wheat field as a weed. Stewart wasinterested in observing how wheat production faired in a field containing the newly created trans-genic weed versus a field in which the wheat competed with the regular, non-transgenic weed. What he found was that the transgenic weed was much less effective at limiting crop production. Rather than making it stronger, the gene flow from the transgenic crop apparently made it weaker.One reason for this outcome, according to Stewart, is that when wild plants breed with crop plantsthey inherit a large load of crop genes that reduces their overall fitness. Thus, any fitness gainedfrom the Bt gene is counteracted by the fitness lost to the other, essentially weaker crop genes. Also in contrast to Snow's work was a recent study involving the insertion of a different trans- gene into wild sunflowers\u2014one that confers resistance to white mold\u2014which found that the newtrait did not result in increased seed production. The co-author of that study, Indiana Universitybiologist Loren Rieseberg, did not portray it as contradicting Snow's work. Rather she said itpoints to a \"need to examine each transgene and crop on a case-by-case basis. Some transgeneswill have major ecological impacts and others probably won't.\" Carol Mallory-Smith, a plant geneticist whose research at Oregon State has focused on the poten- tial of gene flow between wheat and a weed called jointed goat grass, believes that predictinglong-term environmental effects of gene flow is nearly impossible without the data gained fromlong-term observation. For example, while transgenic wheat varieties, of which none are yet onthe market, could potentially breed with jointed goat grass, there is so much difference betweenthe species that it is not clear what sort of hybrid would result. The differences between the twospecies also suggests that there might be a way to create transgenic wheat so that it is less likelyto pass on the novel trait to jointed goat grass. HAVE TRANSGENES: WILL TRAVEL 12\"There are a whole bunch of us who are in the middle on this issue saying we just don't have the data,\" she said. \"Yes, we know that outcropping with hybrids will occur where you have relativecompatibility with a wild species. But what happens over several generations is where we are real-ly lacking the knowledge. We know you can move a gene from a crop to a wild relative, butunder continued growth in natural conditions in the field, we don't know what will happen tothat gene long-term. And even if it is retained, will it matter?\" One potential problem is that a new transgenic hybrid could become \"invasive\" - that is, compete with, take over and replace other established or native species, with sometimes serious ecological consequences. The nation has had experience with invasive plant species, like kudzu, that have beendeliberately or accidentally introduced into the United States with disastrous results. On the otherhand, thousands of beneficial non-native crops and plants have been brought to the U.S. which havebecome established but not invasive. Trying to predict in advance whether a new introduced plantwill become invasive and problematic, benign, or beneficial remains a scientific challenge. TheNational Academy of Sciences report observes that past experience with the study of invasive speciesillustrates that \"we have little power to predict which species will be a successful invader, whichecosystem may be particularly vulnerable to invasion or what the impact of invasions will be.\" A related concern is that a transgenic hybrid could outcompete and replace native varieties, lead- ing to a loss in genetic or biological diversity. There is concern in Mexico, for example, that genesfrom GM varieties of corn could flow into native strains of maize, reducing the genetic diversityof various wild strains of maize. Others note that such native wild varieties constantly swap genesin their natural environments, and that the introduction of transgenic genes is unlikely to have animpact on overall genetic diversity. One limiting factor to understanding the risks posed by gene flow from transgenics is the lack of good baseline data. Snow points out that while evidence to date suggests that conventional cropsdo not routinely cause problems by breeding with wild relatives, it could be that \"we haven'tlooked for them that much or maybe the effects are very subtle.\" Authors of the NAS report agree that limited scientific knowledge is hampering our ability to \"judge whether extensive commercialization of transgenics and other crops bearing novel traitswill significantly perturb agro ecosystems or neighboring ecosystems...\". The report further statesthat accurate assessments of environmental impacts resulting from transgenics require routine andcomprehensive environmental monitoring of agricultural and natural ecosystems. And unless theU.S. begins collecting such systematic data, the NAS report states, \"it will not be possible to sepa-rate coincidental anecdote from real ecological trends.\"PEW INITIATIVE ON FOOD AND BIOTECHNOLOGY13 One potential problem is that a new transgenic hybrid could become \"invasive\" - that is, compete with, takeover and replace other established or native species,with sometimes serious ecological consequences.Technologies to Control GM Gene Flow Snow and others believe some of the concern about gene flow could be reduced if technology and techniques are developed that limit the ability of transgenic crops to spread their pollen or seed.Indeed, there already is a considerable amount of work underway to identify the best methods ofsegregating transgenic crops, planting \"buffer crops\" to catch drifting pollen, and controlling thetiming of flowering and seed production so that they are less likely to breed with either othercrops or wild relatives. Some researchers are working on creating transgenic plants incapable of outcrossing with other plants or plants that produce only sterile seeds. These technologies are known as \"technology pro-tection systems (TSPs)\" or \"genetic use restriction technologies (GURTs)\". But when news that geneticists were developing such technology spread around the world, an international furor erupted. Critics dubbed it the \"terminator\" technology, and raised many fearsabout possible environmental impacts and impacts on small farmers who save seeds to plant yearafter year. Lost in the public uproar was a discussion of how gene use restriction technology couldbe used as a tool to mediate potential impacts of gene flow. Nevertheless, developing an acceptable biological check on gene flow may become a necessity for industry if it wants to broadly commercialize the newest generation of transgenic plants, plantsfor which gene flow has become the dominant concern. Recent published research suggests thatthere may be other approaches to preventing unwanted gene flow without producing sterile seeds. Many biotech scientists and companies are close to commercializing transgenic crops that have been modified to produce pharmaceutical proteins and industrial materials. Other researchers arecreating plants that might be able to produce vaccines against such diseases as Hepatitis B, rabies,and possibly HIV. The plants with which they are working include corn, rice, potatoes, canola,wheat, barley, spinach, and alfalfa, all food and feed crop plants. Because these crops would notbe intended to be used as food or feed, preventing unintentional commingling with food and feedcrops becomes a paramount concern. In fact, scientists like Norm Ellstrand believe that while scientific investigations of gene flow from transgenics have concentrated mainly on potential ecological problems, the advent of pharmaceu-tical and industrial crops\u2014coupled with the growing controversy surrounding the co-mingling oftransgenics with organic varieties--is shifting the focus from crop-to-wild gene flow to crop-to-crop gene flow. HAVE TRANSGENES: WILL TRAVEL 14 Nevertheless, developing an acceptable biological check on gene flow may become a necessity for industry if theywant to broadly commercialize the newest generation oftransgenic plants, plants for which gene flow hasbecome the dominant concern.\"While there is certainly no reason to abandon research on crop-to-wild gene flow, the data and skills accumulated in this endeavor may prove helpful in addressing the simpler, but perhaps moreurgent, issues of transgene flow among crops,\" notes Ellstrand. In the past year, concerns about gene flow from newly-developed pharmaceutical and chemical producing plants has prompted calls from opponents for a moratorium on cultivating these vari-eties outside of greenhouses. Even some in industry have considered voluntarily restricting pro-duction to areas far removed from agricultural areas, such as in the middle of the desert, actionsthat were never contemplated in response to the potential ecological impacts of gene flow. Given the financial stakes\u2014millions of dollars invested in pharmaceutical and industrial plants, farmers eager to find new forms of cash crops and organic growers fearing the loss of lucrativemarkets\u2014the issue of gene flow from transgenics appears destined to generate more headlines, andpossibly more laws and regulations, in the coming years.
