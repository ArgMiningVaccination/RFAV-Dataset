The unique combination of these elements come together to make up the doshas\u2014the constitutions of vata, pitta, and kapha. According to Ayurveda, the doshas control the creation, maintenance, and breakdown of bodily tissue and elimination of wastes, as well as psychological aspects, such as emotions, understanding, and love. When balanced, the doshas maintain the systems of the body; when one of the doshas increases due to certain diet and lifestyle habits, imbalance is created. Ayurveda can help restore harmony to areas that have lost balance. The Three Doshas Each dosha has a number of corresponding qualities that are expressed in the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of one's being.
