Looking back at the year 2019, we are filled with gratitude for our ever-increa- sing global collaboration, and for the way that it had been initiated by Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler. And we remember Georg Gl\u00f6ckler, who gave mathematical-astronomical seminars for the medical movement worldwide, remembering his professional competence, his unique humor and his teaching gifts. A sense of growing seriousness lay over the year 2019, with the comprehensive global ecological crisis, poverty, war and displacement - and also with growing criticism of homeopathy and increasingly Anthroposophic Medicine, which contri - buted significantly to the closure of the clinic in J\u00e4rna (Sweden), an anthroposophic hospital with a worldwide reputation. Intensive efforts by IVAA and the Medical Section could not prevent this from happening but did contribute to a hopeful new beginning in the Swedish anthroposophic-medical movement. Friends of the an - throposophic-medical movement are under severe pressure in Scandinavia, Eng - land, Spain and France, the availability of anthroposophic medications is becoming more problematic in Italy, and Anthroposophic Medicine is increasingly under at - tack from 'sceptics' in Germany, too. It is obvious that we must work much harder in the area of public relations. In the Medical Section at the Goetheanum, there was a change in 2019: Heike Sommer, who had been responsible for public relations since 2006 and was the first to esta - blish the presence of the anthroposophic medical movement in the social media, left us in spring 2019; we were then able to welcome Ariane Totzke as a new mem - ber of our team at the end of July. A growing demand for freedom and self-responsibility, which is also sought by many patients in the health care system, is currently confronted with paternalistic and authoritarian policies in many countries worldwide. This is also true of the rapidly spreading trend towards government-mandated vaccination - a field of medicine in which research depends almost exclusively on industry and one which is generating particularly high growth in sales. A major effort was made last year to formulate a balanced response to this, one which does not deny the global merits of protective vaccinations and yet at the same time defends freedom of thought and choice for those affected and for doctors. Looking back to 2019 in keywords, we are delighted with the content and atmosphere of our successful annual conference, with more than 700 participants, the ongoing development of international postgraduate medical training ( IPMT ), which was linked to public conferences, such as one in Colombia, and related new courses, such as the ones on anthroposophic mistletoe therapy in the USA, India and Thailand, and which celebrated a final, culminating IPMT in the Czech Republic, with almost 300 participants from four countries, as well as launching a new follow-up and extension format, consisting of a theme-oriented, five-day medical conference in New Zealand, which will soon be followed by similar events in Russia and Ukraine, the initiative of a worldwide training in anthroposophic pharmacy, which will begin in 2020/21 with three training courses in Colombia, Eastern Europe (Kra - Dr. med. Matthias Girke Head of the Medical Section, Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society Georg Soldner Deputy Head of the Medical Section3k\u00f3w and Moscow) and Asia (Bangkok), with the collaboration of Albert Schmidli, M\u00f3nica Mennet-von Eiff and Annette Greco, the fruitful work of the CARE working groups established in 2017, whose expert contributions in generally understandable language are available online in Eng - lish and German and have already reached a volume of almost 600 pages (https://www.anthromedics.org/PRA-0357-EN) . Our very warm thanks especi - ally to Dagmar Brauer for her work on this! We are also pleased with the development of the online Vademecum of External Applications in Anthroposophic Nursing in six languages: http://www.pflege-vademecum.de. Carol Brousseau has been providing the translation of this site into English, as she has also been doing for www.anthromedics.org. By the end of the year she had also com- pleted the translation of an extensive handbook on anthroposophic nursing practice, which will be published in 2020, the complete renewal of our website on mistletoe therapy: https://www.mistel-therapie.de, which will also be available in English by the end of February 2020, and the English edition of Best Practices for Mistletoe Use in Cancer Care, the extensive, intersectional work in the field of eurythmy therapy, for example in preparing a first basic eurythmy therapy training under the direction of Kaspar and Annette Zett, which will begin in Dornach in autumn 2020 and will require no prior eurythmy training - a joint pilot project of the Medical Section and the Section for the Performing Arts, the successful start of Hana Adamcov\u00e1's work as the new IKAM coordinator for eurythmy therapy, the very well attended art therapy conference in January 2019, with almost 300 participants, the conference on Goethean Science in Medicine in March 2019, organized jointly with the Natural Science Section, with 150 participants, the recognition of Spacial Dynamics\u00ae as a form of anthroposophic body therapy, the increasing appreciation of training for trainers, which will be offered for the first time in Buenos Aires (Argentina) for all of South America from February 27 to March 1, 2020. Our work as Section leaders took us to China, the Philippines, New Zealand, Thai - land, India, Israel, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the USA , England, Belgium, Spain, France, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Russia and of course Germany and Switzer - land, among others in 2019. Again and again we noticed that we receive extremely valuable suggestions from all countries and that international exchange is beco - ming increasingly important. A first world congress on integrative pediatrics in S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), held No - vember 22-23, 2019, was the most recent significant step towards the develop - ment of integrative medicine. We owe this congress largely to our anthroposophic medical colleague Prof. Ricardo Ghelman at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and many colleagues from the field of anthroposophic pediatrics. Other specialists also participated successfully in congresses on integrative medicine, such as Prof. Erik Baars from Leiden (Netherlands) and Prof. Ursula Wolf from Bern (Switzerland).4In September 2019, leading orthodox medical experts from Iran, Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Italy and Germany met at the Goetheanum on the topic of integra- tive care in oncology, with a focus on external applications in anthroposophic care. Two months later, in November 2019, a first symposium on integrative pain therapy took place at the University of Haifa (Israel) with numerous interested young doctors and medical students. The exemplary Integrated Curriculum for Anthroposophic Medicine ( ICURAM ) at Witten/Herdecke University continues to attract international attention at congresses on medical education and training. Our collaboration within the Goetheanum leadership, and Matthias Girke's work within the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society has been very lively, trusting and satisfying. Here we should mention our fruitful co - operation with the country representatives of the national societies worldwide, which gives this work an important international dimension also for the Medical Section. We are also lookng forward to working with the new leaders of the Natural Science Section, Matthias Rang and Johannes Wirz, and with the leaders taking responsibility for the General Anthroposophical Section, Constanza Kaliks, Peter Selg and Claus-Peter R\u00f6h. The World Goetheanum Forum, September 27-28, 2019, provided space for for - ward-looking initiatives, for example in the field of outpatient care in the Nether - lands (Buurtzorg) and anthroposophic social care in Great Britain (Ruskin Mill). Looking ahead to the year 2020, all activities are currently focusing on prepa - ring for the 100th anniversary of Anthroposophic Medicine. We are looking for - ward to our research conference, March 6-8, 2020, on the founding of Anthroposophic Medicine in the context of Rudolf Steiner's first course for physicians (translated as Introducing Anthroposophical Medicine, SteinerBooks 2011, vol. GA 312) (https://bit.ly/2GMcRSn), the meticulously prepared upcoming new German edition of vol. GA 312 (Geis - teswissenschaft und Medizin), Rudolf Steiner's first lecture cycle for physicians, and the planned series of commentary volumes beginning in 2020, to be edited by Peter Selg and Peter Heusser; the relaunch of the English Training in Anthroposophic Medicine in 2020, with Michael Evans, James Dyson, Anna Hubbard, David Martin and Matthias Girke (https://bit.ly/3afLn4T ), our oncology conference, May 8-10, 2020, which is being prepared by CARE Groups IV and V (Oncology and Palliative Care) ( https://bit.ly/2H21Hcp ); our international medical-pedagogical early childhood conference, June 10-13, 2020, which is being prepared together with the Pedagogical Section within the framework of our CARE I working group on pregnancy, birth and early childhood (https://bit.ly/2OpDzEB); the Faust Conference \"Crises, Abysses and Development - The Human Being Medicine Today\" , July 10-12, 2020 ( https://bit.ly/35U4oqf World Conference \"Crossing Bridges\" , September 12-20, 2020, where we want to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Anthroposophic Medicine and dedicate a festive ceremony to it ( https://bit.ly/36VaIhQ ). In this context, we expressly thank the young team that has been preparing the World Conference since 2017 and invite everyone connected with our movement from near and far to join us for this unique event. 5From January 1, 2020, Rolf Heine will be increasingly active for the Medical Section and IKAM , for which we are very grateful. His core tasks will include - together with Mathias Hofmann, who heads the IKAM Office - developing the coordination work in IKAM, coordinating the work of the nursing profession worldwide in IKAM and in the interdisciplinary CARE working groups, and collaborating within the Section team, including Section work in the School of Spiritual Science. We are also pleased that Johannes Weinzirl continues to be associated with the work of the Section. He has played a significant role in the preparation of our Research and World Conferences for 2020 and has launched a medical training initiative in colla - boration with the field of education for special needs and social therapy. We sincerely thank all those who, through their donations, have made possible and are making possible the activities of the Section in 2019 and the prepara- tion for our activities in 2020! Without this worldwide support, the work that the Section Team does to serve Anthroposophic Medicine would not be possible. We thank the General Anthroposophical Society for its comprehensive support of Section activities at the Goetheanum, which goes far beyond financial contribu- tions to the Section budget - this solidarity is fundamental to our work. But we also thank those who, through their criticism, have pointed out to us what we can do better and we expressly encourage you to give us honest and open feedback at any time! Since its inception, Anthroposophic Medicine has been an integrative form of medicine, i.e., it has required knowledge of Western conventional medicine. It is also attracting increasing interest from doctors who have received training in Tradi - tional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ), homeopathic medicine and Ayurveda in India and China. Anthroposophic Medicine has the potential to contribute to mutual understanding between different streams in the worldwide development of me- dicine. It wants to build a bridge between science-based medicine, on the one hand, and knowledge of the human life organism and soul life on the other, while fully including the human 'I' in patient encounters and therapy. The specific ability of the human 'I' is to develop one's own soul life and to be capable of altering one's actions and lifestyle through insight, knowledge and self-management. Considering the global burden of disease today and tomorrow, these decisive fac - tors in medicine will increasingly depend on it. Starting with the question of breastfeeding, the practice of nutrition, exercise, care for one's own mental and spiritual development, overcoming traumatic ex- periences (also through artistic activities) and inner practice and meditative work: Anthroposophic Medicine encompasses a diverse, therapeutically effective poten - tial at the level of conscious 'I' activity. However, this is of central importance for the prevention and treatment of the chronic diseases prevailing today and tomorrow. An approach to medicine that sees patients as objects is not enough in the 21st century and does not do justice to human dignity. In contrast, all artis- tically applied external applications are already acts of devotion from 'I' to 'I' , and already strengthen the 'I' in its own activity. Similarly, anthroposophic medici- nal products, such as those used in mistletoe therapy, strengthen 'I' activity and the human warmth organization that is closely associated with it. And the same applies to eurythmy therapy, artistic therapies and anthroposophic body therapy. Anthroposophic Medicine has much to offer in the field of integrative medicine and we expressly welcome development and bridge-building in this field. At the same time, Anthroposophic Medicine itself requires a strengthening of its own 6contours, a clear profile and continued work on its inner sources, as well as work to develop a contemporary quality of patient care. We see the AnthroMed\u00ae trademark as an opportunity to make Anthroposophic Medicine visible as a part of integrative medicine that has its own specific character, just as Waldorf schools do in education and the Demeter\u00ae trademark does in organic farming, which after difficult years has now established itself very successfully as a premium brand. Anthroposophic Medicine has a similar potential within the growing field of integ - rative medicine. We hope that the year 2020, in the seriousness of the present situation and in the joy and encouragement that an anniversary celebration brings, will create and strengthen in us the right mood, presence of mind and strength for initiative and cooperation. Matthias Girke Georg Soldner Head of the Medical Section Deputy Head of the Medical Section 7Anthromedics - Basic Principles and Best Practice Our specialist portal for Anthroposophic Medicine is growing! 15 months after we activated our \"Basics\" and \"Practice\" sections, you can access 125 concise articles and 16 video clips, either by clicking on selected directory pages or by using our keyword search tool. Our interprofessional best-practice recommendations in the \"Practice\" section are central. They are original results from the Section's CARE working groups that have been written in response to specific international healthcare needs. These articles on pregnancy, birth and early childhood, on the most important infectious diseases, as well as on symptoms associated with oncology and palliative care are available free of charge in English and German. All texts are being continuously translated into Spanish as well, with plans to make this third language available on www.anthromedics.org in 2020. So far, more than 70 authors have presented their expert knowledge and pro - cessed it through various forms of peer review. For example, our international expert groups started out by giving recommendations on \"Fever Management\" Adults\" and \"Uncomplicated Infections of the Lower Urinary Tract\" from the per - spective of Anthroposophic Medicine - arrived at by consensus in informal proce - dures. These recommendations thus have \"level 1\" guideline character. Some lea - ding practical questions were: how can acute and recurrent infections be treated sensibly against the background of increasing antibiotic resistance? What can be done with medication and support to guide a patient's inflammatory response and thereby strengthen his or her immunological competence? Find out at anthrome - dics.org under \"Infectious Diseases\". Among the major therapeutic challenges in palliative care are the symptoms of anxiety, pain, shortness of breath and edema. Also, spiritual aspects become in - creasingly important when death seems imminent. How can the rapidly changing needs of patients be met with understanding and appropriate assistance? Collea - gues from palliative medicine, nursing care, body therapy, eurythmy therapy, art therapy, psychooncology and pastoral care offer practical knowledge and sugges - tions for treatment. For selected oncological symptoms - such as cancer fatigue and chemotherapy side effects - we show how these can be effectively improved with anthroposo - phic medication and symptom-specific interdisciplinary treatment concepts. We provide helpful links wherever available, such as directly to the corresponding ins - tructions in the online handbook Vademecum of External Applications in Anthroposophic Nursing Care. In addition to specialist information on the CARE topics of pregnancy, birth and early childhood, we already offer several parent information texts and descriptive short videos on promoting health in small children in the family environment. Ot - her papers have been written to share with professional colleagues and include herbal remedies for typical pregnancy complaints, nursing care and music therapy for premature babies, and a description of how human beings develop from con - ception to birth in terms of their fourfold constitution. Our editorial task includes the creation of bibliographies for each individual con - tribution. All cited Der Merkurstab articles are linked to \"Merkurstab Online\" , where Dagmar Brauer Research Associate, Anthromedics Editor in Dornach8readers can see the abstract or purchase the article. Likewise, all research articles listed in the bibliography are linked to the abstract of the corresponding scientific journal, if they have a digital object identifier ( DOI). We plan to further develop our Anthromedics project at the level of web design and technical functionality, especially in 2020. Coordination and Contact: Dagmar the International Training ( IPMT ) weeks suc - cessfully completed in 2019, it could be observed that a gratifying trend of recent years is becoming more and more established: the organizing countries are beco - ming increasingly independent with regard to the planning and implementation of these training weeks. What had been common practice in Chile, the USA and the Czech Republic for many years, namely independent preparation of the courses, direct communication with the invited lecturers and responsibility for covering most of the actual costs, is now also perceived as a task by preparation groups in other countries and is increasingly being undertaken. We are pleased with this de - velopment and it also reflects the fact that - apart from Romania and Mexico - most countries have completed their first five-year cycle and can therefore build on the experience gained. This self-responsibility could also be observed in Iloilo in the Philippines: the re - sponsible group independently led the Goethean plant observation, text work, eve - ning work on a meditation for young doctors in small groups and the daily review with methodological professionalism. Anthroposophic Medicine is now recogni - zed in the Philippines as part of complementary and traditional medicine. In the meantime, five colleagues are certified as AM physicians, which enables them to work as representatives of the Philippines Association of Anthroposophic Health Practitioners Inc. ( PAAHPI ) to certify all other health professionals nationally within the framework of the recognition regulations. Two of these doctors also work at universities, which enabled 20 interested medical students to participate in the IPMT again this year. The younger generation was thus fully integrated. Another of these physicians, who has been actively involved since the early days of IPMT , has for many years already built up an exemplary public health project in Mindenao, which is based on anthroposophy, and which has repeatedly provided valuable, im - mediate assistance after the numerous natural disasters which hit the Philippines in recent years. In Thailand, too, an Anthroposophic Medicine Association has emerged in the seven years of IPMT . It has some 115 members, almost a third of whom are physici - ans. In addition to the annual IPMT week, this time with about 85 participants, the board organizes numerous supplementary AM courses, to which specialist lectu - rers from Europe are invited, e.g., on organ therapy, gynecology and neurology. There are also ongoing courses on art therapy, Pressel massage and biography work. Stefan Langhammer IPMT Coordination, Project Manager, Finances9In addition, a music therapy training course started in April this year and a first qualifying nursing course started in July. A course on mistletoe therapy in oncology for doctors, which is taking place for the third time in India, has now been joined by a group of Thai doctors. After the first two modules in Bangkok, this Thai group will attend the Indian course and then join them in going to Arlesheim and the Goetheanum for the fourth module. Planning is underway for the launch of a four-year training course in Anthroposo - phic Pharmacy for the entire Far East region, including Australia and New Zealand, in 2020, to be held south of Bangkok (Thailand). An additional four-year pharmacy training course for Eastern Europe will begin in 2021 in Krak\u00f3w (Poland) and con - tinue in Moscow (Russia) from 2022 to 2024, while the IPMT in Colombia, which will start a new five-year cycle in 2020, will integrate pharmacy training for South America. The fourth IPMT week in Tultenango (Mexico) focused on human individuality and the I-organization connected with it. The participants were deeply touched, especially by the personal experiences and case studies from the clinical field con - cerning allergic and autoimmune diseases. Things became very practical both in the pharmaceutical course, where the participants made three preparations, and in the study of the medicinal plant Artemisia mexicana (Mexican wormwood). Here, the Goethean approach enabled the participants, through guided observation, to gain an understanding of the mode of action of this plant, which, as was discovered in retrospect, turned out to largely coincide with the known indications - a lastingly satisfying experience! Three lecturers from Argentina, who led the workshop on psychotherapy and education for special needs, not only showed a high level of professionalism in human and didactic terms, for which there was a great deal of positive feedback, but also made it directly tangible how naturally and authenti - cally Anthroposophic Medicine is currently lived and represented in their part of the world. While new five-year IPMT cycles will begin in Colombia, Taiwan and the Philip - pines, the multi-professional IPMT \"Sources of Health\" training series with the the - me \"Wisdom of Old Age - Completion and New Beginning\" in the Rosicrucian city of esk\u00fd Krumlov (Czech Republic) has come to an end after ten years. More than 300 participants explored the question of how to achieve a healthy culture of aging and dying, incorporating the ideals of wisdom, goodness and love that reach be - yond the threshold of death. In that series it was possible to discuss everyday re - generation and ageing processes in nature, the mystery of sleeping and waking, and connections extending to reincarnation and destiny. This completed the se - cond IPMT cycle on the Vltava river, but the work in the area where Eastern and Western Europe intersect is expected to continue in 2021 with a new IPMT impulse in Slovakia. While in countries such as Malaysia or the Czech Republic the IPMT curriculum covers a wide range of topics and incorporates not only medical but also educatio - nal, economic and mathematical-astronomical topics, with a steadily growing number of participants, there have also been IPMT s in which the number of parti- cipants has not increased in recent years, but has concentrated on the circle of people whose objective is to implement Anthroposophic Medicine in their count - ry. This is the case in Ukraine, for example, where on the outskirts of Kiev in the Borysfen Waldorf School about 40 doctors already largely familiar with Anthropo - sophic Medicine came together and devoted themselves to selected topics from IPMT Columbia, Awarding of Certificates IPMT Tschechia, Morning Eurythmy 10neurology, gynecology, external applications and oil-dispersion bath therapy, as well as an impressive patient presentation and discussion. A special focus was on the question of how Anthroposophic Medicine can gain a stronger foothold in the Ukrainian public sphere following the founding of the Ukrainian Association of Anthroposophical Doctors and Therapists ( UAAAT ) at the end of 2018. To this end, there is a need for training in how to produce anthroposophic medications within the framework of a magistral pharmacy in Ukraine - leading to an initial training course in late autumn. There will also be a one-day symposium on Anthro - posophic Medicine and a medical conference at the University of Kiev in 2020. This gives hope that what was initiated by the IPMT work of the past years will soon come to fruition. After twelve years of IPMT , a new IPMT impulse is also planned in the USA . From 2020 onwards the five-year cycle will be shortened to a four-year cycle. Each IPMT week will include a course strand for new participants and a further training strand for those who have already completed their training. Each cycle of four IPMT weeks will be complemented by activities that will ensure continuous learning even in the periods between IPMT s. For example, the webinars that have been held for some time will be intensified. A 90-minute webinar will be held monthly from Oc - tober to March, consisting of two 30-minute presentations followed by open di - scussion. About 120 people are already participating in these sessions, including people from South America, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The webinars are recorded and can be viewed at a later date; they are regarded as 'contact time' for doctors seeking certification. A further innovation is to expand the mentoring re- quired in the certification process to a program consisting of three components. In addition to individual mentoring, there will be video-supported distance group mentoring in the future, which will enable discussion between the participants, and a mid-year mentoring retreat, during which the doctors will practice clinical exami - nations and the preparation of case descriptions. These modifications are intended to meet the changing needs and make use of the technical possibilities developed in recent years. In addition to IPMT sessions, further training in the new format of a medical conference took place for the first time in Wellington (New Zealand) in mid- February 2019. While the IPMT s serve to provide training in Anthroposophic Me- dicine for the various professional groups, the somewhat shorter, five-day Medi- cal Conferences concentrate on interprofessional deepening of challenging medical topics from the five CARE areas being worked with in the Medical Section. They thus offer a format that can be placed in addition to the IPMT or can provide further training after completion of an IPMT cycle or several cycles. At Victoria University in Wellington, the requested topic was the treatment of chronic pain syndromes. More than 80 committed participants grappled with the problem in interprofessio - nal working groups and colloquia, accompanied by text work and lectures. In 2020, two further Medical Conferences will be held in Russia and Ukraine. Another new international training impulse that will be implemented from 2020 is the English Training in Anthroposophic Medicine, a three-year qualifying further training course in Anthroposophic Medicine for doctors in English - the only one in Europe - located at Emerson College in Sussex (England). Here, start - ing in February 2020, physicians will study the theory and practice of Anthroposo - phic Medicine in a total of nine one-week modules. Three of these modules are clinical training weeks which will be conducted at clinics of AM in Berlin-Havel- 11h\u00f6he, Witten/Herdecke and Arlesheim. This training course should be seen as an - other complementary offer to IPMT . It is intended to meet the need for a compact, continuing medical education course in Europe in the English language, with a cli - nical orientation. On the threshold of the Anniversary Year of Anthroposophic Medicine, it is clear that the field of international AM training is expanding to enable us to respond fle - xibly and appropriately to the tasks and needs that we face today. Our heartfelt thanks go to all those who, through their active or financial com - mitment, again this year made it possible for 14 further training weeks to take place and inspire the participants for their work! Coordination and Contact: Stefan Langhammer, stefan.langhammer@medsektion-goetheanum.ch https://ipmt.medsektion-goetheanum.org Conferences and Meetings The more than 100 events, meetings and conferences a year which Fran\u00e7ois Bonh\u00f4te organizes in collaboration with the Section leadership and preparation groups in the different professional fields of Anthroposophic Medicine bring ever new tasks and impulses with them. The support provided by staff responsible at the Goetheanum is central for suc - cessful implementation. A particular milestone in preparing for the Anniversary Year 2020 of Anthroposophic Medicine has been our collaboration on the program content and practical planning for our annual conference. Together with the young medical professionals preparing the conference, the Section leadership and the Medical Section team at the Goetheanum, we are looking forward to this annual conference in September 2020. Coordination and Contact: Fran\u00e7ois Bonh\u00f4te, francois.bonhote@medsektion-goetheanum.ch Fran\u00e7ois Bonh\u00f4te Medicine ( IKAM ) The IKAM Office and the Medical Section's Digital Infrastructure Our development of the Medical Section's digital ecosystem is progressing rapidly, both in terms of the integration of services and the number of contributors (aut - hors, lecturers, students, coordinators), which has now grown to over 300 people. The digital community of the Medical Section can be divided into four user groups, whereby there are many (and desired) overlaps: the specialist authors in the CARE groups, the specialist areas of the International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine ( IKAM ), as well as working groups and spontaneous project teams. The five CARE groups primarily require document management, the project and wor - king groups (such as the preparation group for the 2020 annual conference) have been using our project planning services, and the IKAM coordinators require both productivity and communication services due to their broad range of tasks. Our progress in developing the platform can be summarized as three stages of interna - tional coordination: 1) IKAM Connect, 2) IKAM Collaborate and 3) IKAM Educate. The aim of the Connect phase was to technically connect all coordinators to the Section's ecosystem to make its resources accessible to everyone involved. This phase was completed in 2019. The current phase of collaboration is focusing on in - terdisciplinary cooperation on a technical level: The basic services for efficient col - laboration independent of time and space are video conferencing, which is now as easy to set up as writing an email, editing documents together in real time, simple project planning for small and medium-sized projects and a straightforward form system which can be used for feedback on conference participation or ad-hoc sur - veys on specific topics. Language barriers in some areas can also be broken down by means of translation functions or by automatically adapting the user interface to the respective language of the participants. In the third stage of development, the focus will be on the education sector, with the establishment of a learning and ex - amination environment and the direct transfer of knowledge supported by our al - ready available video streaming platform. The necessary conceptualization for this phase is planned for the end of the coming year. Coordination and Contact: Mathias Doctors' Associations ( IVAA ) 2018 saw the adoption of a new global strategy, professionalization and moderni- zation of the organization, which included the office in Brussels, a new Secretary General and our website. Our collaboration with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in establishing training benchmarks is of great importance and is expected to lead to the publica - tion of WHO Benchmarks for Training in Anthroposophic Medicine in 2020 or 2021. IVAA Team The IVAA board is headed by Thomas Breitkreuz (President, Germany), Tido von Schoen-Angerer (Vice-President/Treasurer, Switzerland) and Iracema Benevides (Vice-President, Brazil). The year 2019 brought some changes to the board: Christine Saahs (Austria) and Claar van Herpen (Netherlands) left the board and a new young doctor from Serbia, Jelena Rabijac, was co-opted in October 2019. The other members of the board are Georg Soldner, Frank Mulder (United King - dom), Laura Borghi (Italy) and Jelena Rabijac (Serbia). The General Secretary is Elisa Baldini. Key Points in 2019 Publication of an opinion on vaccination, and internal debate on vaccines, Progress on the WHO project, Middle East Workshop on integrative oncology in nursing, Creation of arguments against attacks by sceptics, Leadership training for IVAA members (delegates of the doctors' associations for Anthroposophic Medicine), Improved leadership in EUROCAM , introduction of integrative medicine into the European Public Health Alliance ( EPHA ). Strategic Aims for 2019-2023 Goal 1: To contribute to the quality of health care by introducing Anthropo- sophic Medicine into the health care system, Goal 2: To ensure the availability of anthroposophic medicinal products ( AMP ), Goal 3: To promote visibility and recognition of the contribution of Anthropo - sophic Medicine to important health issues, Goal 4: To contribute to integrative medicine. Coordination and Contact: IVAA Board14International Coordination of Research We have been fortunate to rely on the committed work - voluntary and extensive - of Helmut Kiene since the founding of IKAM and as a long-standing board mem - ber of the Research Council of the Medical Section. He not only coordinated the research of Anthroposophic Medicine internatio - nally, motivated his colleagues to cooperate and collaborate, and integrated friends of Anthroposophic Medicine, but contributed his own expertise without reserva - tion. This professional and human strength provided the Section leaders with great support in this area until the end of 2019; at times together with his wife Gunver Kienle. For this we would like to take this opportunity to thank you most sincerely! Helmut Kiene has recently been increasingly pointing out that we should consider research projects in the fields of epistemological methodology, anthropology and the training of cognitive faculties. He himself is currently devoting himself to the controversy surrounding homeopathy and has posted initial expert opinions on the website of his Institute for Applied Epistemology and Medical Methodology (IFAEMM ): http://www.ifaemm.de/F11_homeo.htm. The section leadership will discuss and decide on the successor to take on his coordinating role in a closed Research Council meeting in March 2020. Dagmar Brauer, Matthias Girke, Georg Soldner International Coordination of Specialist Physicians The focus of the activities of our specialist physician working groups is still ancho - red mainly in German-speaking areas, with long-standing working groups on neu - rology, pediatrics, dermatology, gynecology, orthopedics, ENT, gastroenterology, dental medicine and cardiology. In 2019, the Association of Anthroposophic Physi - cians in Germany ( GA\u00c4D ) offered multi-year curricular training on relevant clinical pictures and issues in the fields of cardiology, gynecology and dentistry. We are pleased to report that new initiatives have been added since the end of 2018: In the field of surgery - initiated by Merten Hommann, head of the visceral surgery department at Zentralklinik Bad Berka, and his senior physician Luisa Peter - an initial planning meeting took place for an interprofessional symposium on anthroposophic surgery, which is to be organized at the beginning of 2021 and is intended to become the starting point for further training in the surgical field. The severely threatened and at the same time so essential field of ophthalmolo - gy received a new impulse through a small ophthalmology conference at the Goe - theanum in December 2019, at which Erika Hammer reported from her compre - hensive wealth of experience in glaucoma and maculopathy in several lectures. In this context, a small working group of anthroposophic ophthalmologists (Wim Huige, Gabriele Emmerich, Ingrid Caspar) formed to initiate further regular trai - ning events in various formats. In December 2018, a working group on hemato-oncology was founded at the Goetheanum as a subject group within the General Anthroposophical Society. In addition to intensive study of the spiritual aspects of cancer, this group will devote itself to the diverse challenges of modern oncology from a professional and political perspective. Helmut Kiene International Coordination Research Council Marion Debus International Coordination of Anthroposophic Specialist Physicians15A compact seminar on mistletoe therapy, for which this group was responsible, took place at Filderklinik hospital, near Stuttgart (Germany), in October. There were also interesting new developments regarding international net- working: a group of four dermatologists from the Philippines, who had undergone IPMT training there, travelled to Riga (Latvia) in October 2019 to deepen their ex - pertise in a seminar lasting several days with L\u00fcder Jachens. It remains a great chal - lenge how to provide appropriate mentoring and further training for the many me - dical specialists participating in the numerous IPMT s that are taking place around the world. There is great activity worldwide in the field of oncology: in summer 2019, the third International Integrated Oncology Training conducted by Harihara Murthy, Srinivas Rao and Ravi Doctor started in Mumbai (India). The same group of lectu - rers hosted an additional oncology module in Thailand in December 2019. The last two of a total of four modules will now take place in Hyderabad (India) and Arles - heim (Switzerland) at the beginning of 2020 for the physicians of both countries together, with about 30 participants. Thanks to the initiative of Steven Johnson, a first Best Practices Mistletoe Course was held in Baltimore ( USA ) in June 2019 and met with great interest. A continua - tion is planned for autumn 2020 in Denver ( USA ). In both S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) and Lima (Peru), preparations are underway for mul - ti-year curricular oncology courses starting in 2020. It is hoped that specialized training courses will also develop for other discipli - nes in individual geographical regions. A desideratum remains: worldwide networ - king of specialist groups in their own Internet-based forums. Coordination and Contact: Marion Debus, marion.debus@klinik-arlesheim.ch, www.klinik-arlesheim.ch International Coordination of Physician Training The range of tasks of the international coordination of physician training includes being aware of the trainings offered, developing quality in the training institutions, mutually recognizing each other, implementing a common curriculum and accre - diting the institutions involved. The coordinator works in close consultation with the Section leadership (Georg Soldner) and the international committee of trainers, which consists of representa - tives of training institutions around the world and meets once a year for a working meeting lasting several days. As a result of this work, we jointly developed and adopted a core curriculum for training in Anthroposophic Medicine which applies to all our training programs, as well as an accreditation process for our institutions. An International Accreditation Panel was set up to monitor the accreditation processes of the individual instituti - ons and recommend accreditation to the Section leadership. To ensure the quality of the accreditation process, a two-day auditor training course based on a real accreditation process of training institutions present has been conducted in recent years. To develop the quality of teaching in the training institutions, we have been or - ganizing an annual interdisciplinary further training opportunity for teachers in the Jan Feldmann International Coordination of Anthroposophic Physician Training16field of Anthroposophic Medicine since 2014, which is attended by about 60 par- ticipants from around 20 countries and twelve professional groups. During this training participants learn methodological and didactic techniques for sustainably teaching and deepening Anthroposophic Medicine in their training programs. In 2020, there will be a Teach-The-Teacher conference in South America for the first time, which can serve as a format for other regions of the world in the future. We have set up a kind of handbook for Teach-The-Teacher conferences, a pass - word-protected, interdisciplinary website in English and German where colleagu - es have posted tried-and-tested materials on their teaching didactics and metho - dology, thus providing a collection of materials for teaching in training courses. Coordination and Contact: Jan Feldmann, janfeldmann@yahoo.de, info@akademie-havelhoehe.de International Young Medics Forum In the last two years, the Young Medics Forum has mainly been involved in collabo - ration. For three years now, a young interprofessional group has been preparing the world conference \"The Human Being Is a Bridge\" for September 2020 in coopera - tion with the Medical Section (www.crossingbridges.care). Rudolf Steiner's \"Bridge Lectures\" of 1920 were the starting point in terms of content. Together we want to build bridges between past and future, between thinking and willing, bet - ween love and freedom, between countries, professions, generations, from person to person, and we are looking forward to future impulses for the next 100 years of Anthroposophic Medicine! The conference will follow on from both the \"Streng - thening the Heart\" conference seven years ago and the last three annual confe - rences of the Medical Section. On our website (www.jungmedizinerforum.org) we publish job advertise - ments and maintain a calendar. This gives an overview of events in anthroposo - phic and integrative medicine, some of which are imported semi-automatically from other websites using software developed by us and can also be easily trans - ferred to other calendars. About every three months we send a circular email in several languages to about 1400 recipients. Our forum provides an online platform where, in combination with a blog and social network, short articles with a com - ment function can be posted online, as well as enabling users to post content and questions. In spring 2019 we organized a meeting together with the Initiative for Training in Anthroposophic Medicine (www.ifaam.org) which provides scholarships for training and research, as well as much networking and support for medical stu - dents. We also work together with the GA\u00c4D Academy regarding contacts and working group support. Our meetings on \"The Future of Outpaitent Anthroposo - phic Medicine\" have been a wonderful collaboration with the GA\u00c4D working group on outpatient medicine (in 2018/19 the topics were Teaching Practices, IV Con- tracts, Prevention). In 2018 we organized a second meeting on the \"Future of Cli - nics\" with the Integrated Curriculum for Anthroposophic Medicine ( ICURAM ) at Witten/Herdecke University. Anna Anna ( IMKA ) The main task of IMKA is to take up, as physicians, transnational questions and pro - blems concerning anthroposophic medicinal products, to enter into dialogue with the manufacturers and, if necessary, to mediate between the parties. Andreas Arendt (Schweiz) is the IMKA coordinator. He works together with colleagues and IMKA members Laura Borghi (Italy), Reinhard Schwarz (Austria), Astrid Sterner (Germany) and Georg Soldner (Medical Section). Depending on the task at hand, additional colleagues are consulted. Last year IMKA members met again with WALA , Weleda and, for the first time, with the three largest mistletoe manufacturers Abnoba, Helixor and Iscador AG. The main topics were questions of medication availability, product range changes and research projects. Coordination and Contact: Andreas Arendt, arendt@bluewin.ch, www.vaoas.ch International Coordination of Anthroposophic Pharmacy ( IAAP ) Further Training IAAP has been involved in WHO benchmarking for training in Anthroposophic Pharmacy. A corrected curriculum has meanwhile been submitted to the WHO by Tido von Schoen-Angerer. The final adoption by the WHO is not expected before 2020. Our aim is to establish an international diploma, i.e., certification as a Phar- macist Specialized in Anthroposophic Pharmacy , according to the WHO certifica- tion level that has now been submitted, which would also involve organizing the Medical Section's IPMT training modules accordingly. Our International Further Education Regulation for Pharmacists specialized in Anthroposophic Pharmacy (IFER ) still needs to be adapted to this level, although the national certification level and that of the WHO may differ. An IAAP training committee will deal with all rele - vant issues and make appropriate adjustments to our IFER by the end of the year. Events A Colloquium on Anthroposophic Pharmacy was held at the Goetheanum in Dor - nach from May 30 to June 1, 2019, organized jointly with the Medical Section. The preparation team consisted of the pharmacists well as the chemist Martin Rozumek (WALA ) and the doctors Andreas Arendt and Georg Soldner. The event was a com - plete success and contributed to community building among the anthroposophi - Andreas Arendt International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicines (IMKA ) Manfred Kohlhase International Coordination of Anthroposophic Pharmacy (IAAP )18cally oriented pharmacists, while also strengthening collaboration with the medi- cal profession. Four medical-pharmaceutical working groups from Germany and Switzerland introduced themselves to the more than 50 participants and presen- ted the results of their work, some of which were impressive. The groups were the Substance Group, the Dermatological Working Group around Prof. Schempp, the Goethean Bellis Group from Austria and the Amara Group within GAPiD . These working relationships have existed for many years, but they were neither networked nor well known to the community of anthroposophic pharmacists and doctors. For the first time we were able to see and discuss the fruits of years of spe - cialist work in the field of anthroposophic pharmacy. Further such working groups will present their work in a follow-up event to be held in November 2020. M\u00f3nica Mennet-von Eiff represented IAAP with a contribution on spiritual community buil - ding. The Slovenian pharmacist and IAAP member Vesna Fortneri gave a brilliant presentation of her research results on the medicinal plant Dipsacus. Lively discussions were triggered by the question of the identity of Anthropo- sophic Pharmacists, as well as the question of which of the two Sections - the Natural Science Section or the Medical Section - pharmacists belong to in their opinion. A corrected reprint of our German textbook on Anthroposophic Pharmacy has now been published (Anthroposophische Pharmazie). So far there have been no translations into other languages. AnthroMed g GmbH IAAP aims to become one of the ten shareholders in AnthroMed gGmbH. IAAP would then no longer be just a licensee, it would be co-responsible for the AnthroMed\u00ae trademark. This will require an entry in the Swiss commercial register, which is associated with bureaucratic hurdles. For example, all IAAP board members had to present notarized signature certification, which led to a long delay and additional costs. Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex APC Status Version 4.1. of the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex APC is now online and is also available in printed form. Projects/Tasks Preparation of our Pharmaceutical Colloquium III (2020) together with the Medical Section, Cooperation with the Medical Section, including secretariat, international phar - maceutical training ( IPMT ) and a cooperation agreement, Increased fundraising, Formation of a training committee, adaptation of our IFER and coordination of the pharmaceutical modules within IPMT , AnthroMed\u00ae-Pharmacy; active involvement in AnthroMed gGmbH as a share - holder, Further development of the APC.19Coordination and Contact: Manfred Kohlhase, manfred.kohlhase@medsektion-ikam.org, www.iaap-pharma.org International Coordination of Therapy January to September 2019 Monika Folz and Kristian Schneider took care of the important coordination work in eurythmy therapy until winter 2018 / spring 2019. They were involved in all areas of the eurythmy therapy world. For various reasons, Monika Folz's unique contri - bution could not continue from June onwards; we would like to take this opportu - nity to thank her for her important work. Kristian Schneider fell ill in summer and has taken time out until further notice. September to December 2019 Hana Adamcov\u00e1 (n\u00e9e Giteva) from Prague took up the work of coordinator on September 1, 2019. She has many years of experience in the field, has coordinated the IPMT s in the Czech Republic for the last ten years and has now completed a Master of Arts in Eurythmy Therapy at the Alanus University of Arts and Social Sciences. She is currently acquainting herself with the eurythmy therapy movement and acquiring insight into its multifaceted aspects. The first concrete tasks that need to be addressed are the design of the new homepage, updating of the address lists and designing the newsletter. Many people from different areas are assisting her. A meeting with our country representatives took place in September. This ex - change across the world is highly appreciated by all participants. A meeting of the International Federation of Anthroposophic Arts and Euryth- my Therapies ( IFAAET ) also took place in September. A new board was elected. Eurythmy therapy is now represented by Christine Allsop (Austria) and Daniela Oehler (Netherlands). The activities of this important umbrella organization will be developed and supported. Barbara Steinmann and Kathryn Harington also hold very important positions. Both are active as representatives of the federation in EUROCAM and the Association for Natural Medicine in Europe ( ANME ). At the beginning of November, we had our trainers' conference and methods day, where we heard from the seven training centers and twelve training initiatives from all over the world. A new basic eurythmy therapy training in Dornach was also presented, the start of which is planned for autumn 2020. This new training leads to a recognized professional qualification in Switzerland and is a joint pilot project of the Medical Section and the Section for the Performing Arts. It will integrate all the necessary elements of basic eurythmy training into the training and in the Swiss system will lead after four years to an officially recognized professional qualification ( OdA KT sector certificate), after five years to a Goetheanum Diploma and after six years to a Higher Professional Examination. The sector certificate entitles the holder to obtain an EMR quality label for therapists, as well as be recognized professionally by health insurance providers and old age and survivors' insurance ( AHV ). This Kristian Schneider International Hana Adamcov\u00e1 International Coordination of Eurythmy Therapy20eurythmy training will devote more attention to medical knowledge and an- throposophic anthropology in the curriculum and provide training in the profes - sional qualities and skills that therapists Contact: Hana Adamcov\u00e1, hana.adamcova@medsektion-ikam.org, www.eurytmie.cz , www.antroposofickamedicina.cz Therapy (IAABT) International Collaboration \"Trauma & Resilience\" was the title of our international conference for anthropo - sophic body therapy, which was held at the Goetheanum, May 1-4, 2019, and was the highlight of this year's international and interprofessional collaboration. With 180 participants from 25 countries, the conference was essential for en - counters, professional exchange and further training. A valuable addition was the integration of a CARE III meeting. IKAM Accreditation - Ensuring Quality in Training and Further Training Representatives from Bothmer\u00ae gymnastics, oil dispersion bath therapy, rhythmi - cal massage therapy and massage according to Dr. Simeon Pressel started their training to become IKAM auditors in 2019. Thus, after taking the final examination in 2020, most current methods of body therapy will possess one of the most im - portant tools for ensuring quality within Anthroposophic Medicine. Training and Further Training A special pilot project has started in rhythmical massage therapy: the Academy of Anthroposophic Medicine Havelh\u00f6he in Berlin (Germany) and the Association for Rhythmical Massage Therapy in Switzerland are jointly offering training and further training in rhythmical massage therapy. Its special feature: for participants from Germany it is further professional trai - ning, for participants from Switzerland it is part of the training to become a go - vernment-certified complementary therapist specializing in rhythmical massage therapy. The initiative is currently in the process of obtaining OdA KT recognition. Policy During the Section's annual conference in 2019 we concluded the process of obtai - ning internal recognition of the Spacial Dynamics\u00ae method, which is now a recog - nized method of Anthroposophic Medicine. Elma Pressel International Coordination of Anthroposophic Body Therapy (IAABT )21Networking - Communication The International Association for Anthroposophic Body Therapy ( IAABT ) is the cen - ter for networking in the body therapy sector. On the one hand, it forms the bridge between the outside world and the Medical Section and as such supports commu - nication with the various committees. It also promotes exchange between and development of the methods in body therapy and the associated professional groups. The interprofessional membership of the board ensures that the needs of the various fields are taken into account. Last but not least, IAABT is an extremely important point of reference for therapists from countries where there is no infras - tructure yet for anthroposophic body therapy. Elma Coordination and Contact: Elma Anthroposophic Arts Therapies ( ICAAT ) The light of ideas struggles with the darkness of the creative ground and in this struggle it creates the play of colors of imagination. Walter Benjamin Our working year began as always with our arts therapy conference on the topic of \"Anxiety and Stress - Being Artistic in the Moment\". The topic hit the nerve of the time and was well received. The European Academy (our recognition body for all training and further trai - ning) met this summer in J\u00e4rna (Sweden) and gave itself a new name: i ARTe (Inter - national Association of Anthroposophic Arts Therapies Educations). In addition, a grading procedure was developed that allows students to have previous achieve - ments recognized. This year, training and further training courses in Spain, India and Switzerland were recognized by the Medical Section. The general meeting of the International Federation of Anthroposophic Arts and Eurythmy Therapy ( IFAAET ) was particularly exciting. The association was on the verge of disbanding - but then it was jointly decided to continue the work. A new board was immediately elected and now the international tasks, such as membership in AnthroMed\u00ae and EUROCAM , are being tackled again with a good conception of who we are. Two of our four volumes on anthroposophic arts therapies that are out of print (Therapeutisches Zeichnen und Malen and Plastisch-Therapeutisches Gestalten) are now available for download from Salumed Verlag (Therapeutic Drawing and Painting https://bit.ly/2RLUcLF , Therapeutic Sculpture https://bit.ly/2Reg2Zb ). Kirstin Kaiser International Coordination of Anthroposophic Arts Therapies (ICAAT )22Therapeutic Painting, Drawing and Sculpture At the Section's international annual conference in September we were present with an interactive stand, this time with a modified design, but one that remained true to the concept of blackboard drawings. For this purpose, we developed a sepa - rate flyer in an unusual format and with an unusual design. Our ICAAT flyer was finally available in English, so now we are equipped with international flyers. The location of our stand in the central part of the foyer enabled us to have lively discus - sions with interested doctors and other colleagues. Regarding coordination in the coming year, we are planning to visit students at their universities (Alanus University of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Applied Sciences Leiden, Ottersberg University for Arts in Social Contexts) and in - tensify the contact between us as coordinators, and between us and the Medical Section. We send out our coordination newsletter at least ten times per year. Here we collect and distribute all information which is of interest for arts therapists, inclu - ding job searches. Insights from the Current Year Although we try to be sustainably visible, even within our own professional group people still do not find it self-evident that ICAAT exists, nor are they aware of the fields of work that we cover. In the coming year, our focus will be on establishing more intensive contact with colleagues who teach at IPMT s worldwide, thus promoting interprofessional and international cooperation. Johanna Gunkel Music Therapy As the new coordinator for music therapy, I compiled an overview of the training institutions worldwide. There are currently twelve training centers for anthroposo - phic music therapy, four of which qualify trainees for the profession in the Nether - lands, Switzerland, Italy and Israel. Two further training courses were recently established: anthroposophic music therapy for conventional music therapists in Berlin (Ger - many) Further training for vocal therapists according to the Werbeck School of Unvei - ling the Voice in Munich (Germany). At the same time, I have become well acquainted with our professional field and have established active contact with my colleagues around the world, who are kept informed by a monthly newsletter. Laura Piffaretti Laura Piffaretti International Coordination of Anthroposophic Arts Therapies (ICAAT ) Coordination of Music Therapy23Publicity Work Given the enormous reach of Facebook, we are slowly approaching the use of this medium. Disseminating information in social networks is a way of reporting in addition to print media (magazines, etc.). However, a 'different' language is spo - ken there so a main task is to build up communication strategies in a meaningful way. Several times we had the opportunity to present ourselves in the journal Das Goetheanum, which we are very pleased about. That is good for the 'inner circle'. But what remains is the search for ways to make ourselves more widely known. Ariane Totzke, the refreshing new addition to the public relations work in the Medical Section, is supporting us in this undertaking. Doctors are sometimes inexperienced in prescribing arts therapies - we want to continue to work to overcome this. A film project is to be realized just in time for the Anniversary Year 2020. Silke Speckenmeyer Anthroposophic Therapeutic Speech Our International Symposium on Therapeutic and Educational Speech Formation was held in autumn. Its topic \"Towards Maturity on Earth through Creative Speech\" - to mark 100 years of Waldorf education - enabled us to experience in all contri - butions: what a need there is, and a necessity, to take hold of speech between hu - man beings in this digital age. Colleauges demonstrated how the lessons of grades 1-12 can be penetrated artistically with speech for each grade level. The training situation in anthroposophic therapeutic speech is critical. Despite the availability of professional vocational training opportunities, there is a lack of students. In many conversations with various people and committees we have been trying to understand the causes and rethink the training. The recognition of our work in anthroposophic clinics and various training courses for doctors is source of joy. Our website, which will be relaunched in 2020, will provide information for pa - tients, doctors and speech professionals. It remains only to be reported that from 2020 Laura Piffaretti will take responsi - bility for the overall coordination of arts therapies and my focus will be on the field of speech therapy. At this point I'd like to thank Laura, who has worked hard over the last year to prepare herself, so that I can pass on the responsibility with a clear conscience. Kirstin Kaiser Coordination and Contact Overall Coordination: Laura Piffaretti, laura.piffaretti@medsektion-ikam.org Painting, Drawing Coordination of Anthroposophic Psychotherapy (AP) The International Federation of Anthroposophic Psychotherapy Associations ( IFAPA ) was established in 2012 with eight member associations. Until then, we had been linked almost exclusively through Henriette and Ad Dekkers via IPMT s and training courses. In the following years, three teach-the-teacher conferences took place every two years. A group of about 50 psychotherapists from all over the world has come together as a community of work and destiny. The beautiful grounds of Emerson College in West Sussex (United Kingdom) were chosen as our meeting place. Main subjects of our joint work were: looking at an anthroposophic approach to training methods for course leaders in psychotherapy, acquainting ourselves with and deepening the path of development, and integrating our experiences from the First Class lessons of the School of Spiritual Science. The participants experien - ced that psychotherapy as a method of the art of healing depends even more than in the other healing professions on the individual spiritual development of the therapist, who carries this substance in his or her own soul and makes it available to his or her patients. The internationality of our meetings enriches the spectrum of possible anthro - posophic-psychotherapeutic work thanks to the influences of the countries and continents with their diverse cultures. The work of the members of the board - Jacques Meulmann (Chairman, Netherlands), Miguel Falero (Spain), John Lees (United Kingdom), Giovanna Bettini (Italy), (Brazil), Henriette Dekkers (Netherlands), Hartmut Horn ( IKAM coordinator, Germany) and Ellen Keller (Germany) - was significantly marked by the preparation and planning of a fourth train-the-trainer conference, in addition to various conflict management tasks in member countries, training courses and certifications. This conference will take place in June 2020 and will be the first of three that will focus on research. Together with guest lecturer Gunver Kienle, a research methodology will be presented and developed that is suitable for the field of psychotherapy in practice, considering its predominantly indivi- dual treatment setting. In addition to looking at trainer training and management training, we shall ask how case studies can be made practical and useful for psycho - therapists. New member countries are the USA , Switzerland and Chile.

The founding of ISAN as a subject group within the General Anthroposophical Society was coordinated with and confirmed by the leadership of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum and the leadership of the Medical Section. Its purpose is to promote spiritual scientific research, teaching and further trai - ning on the basis of anthroposophic anthropology and the anthroposophic art of healing. Another purpose is to improve healing care, participate in integrative the - rapy and contribute to public health care. Training and Further Training Certification in anthroposophic naturopathy (\"Anthroposophischer Heilkunde [AGAHP ]\u00ae\") is obligatory for every practitioner seal \"Anthro - posophische Heilkunde ( AGAHP )\u00ae\" is registered German Patent and Trademark Office ( DPMA ). Our association school Anthropos-Sophia provides the framework for such qualification through offering training and further training. Professional Policy and Networking ISAN is represented in the International Coordination of Anthroposophic Medicine (IKAM ), the General Conference of the German Associations of Healing Practitio - ners and through accredited training institutions. Coordination and Contact Alexander Schadow, alexander.schadow@medsektion-ikam.org, www.isan-medsektion.jimdofree.com European Federation of Patients' Associations for Anthroposophic Medicine ( EFPAM ) The following report refers to the activities of EFPAM as an umbrella organization and not to the activities of its member organizations at a national level. International Cooperation EFPAM works closely with other organizations in the field of integrative medicine and health issues, such as EUROCAM , ELIANT and the European Public Health Alli - ance ( EPHA ), all with offices in Brussels (Belgium). The new legislature of the Euro - pean Parliament presents the new challenge of finding delegates who are interes - ted in taking action on behalf of our community. EUROCAM and EPHA are active in the health and medical field and have established valuable contacts among mem - bers of the European Parliament and the European Commission. We will need to Alexander Schadow International Society of Anthroposophic Naturopathy (ISAN ) Ren\u00e9 de Winter President of the European Federation of Patients' Associations for Anthroposophic Medicine (EFPAM )26form contacts with the new European Commission in 2020. EFPAM participates wherever possible. Training EFPAM and its member associations actively promote the health competencies (of patients) that are needed both to cope with one's individual health situation and to support others. Health competencies include not only dealing with acute situations, but also prevention, healthy eating habits, enough physical activity, appropriate living conditions, a healthy environment, mindfulness, etc. Changes in general health care (e.g., efficiency measures, ongoing clinic specialization lea - ding to fewer hospitals and shorter hospital stays, financial constraints, reimburse - ment issues) affect patients throughout Europe. Empowering those affected is therefore more than ever necessary and a task for the entire medical and health community. EFPAM is currently in the process of setting up a website, \"Practical Help for Patients\" , which will offer advice on self-care in everyday situations. The site will use lectures and conferences in addition to digital and paper-based information sources. Policy Although being a patient is of course not a profession, EFPAM strives to promote excellent standards among health professionals. It actively supports the develop - ment of such standards as the basis for well-trained doctors and therapists, and as a condition for Europe-wide official recognition. Network EFPAM participates in various networks both at European level and involving orga - nizations in the field of Anthroposophic Medicine and health care, all connected to IKAM . Prepared for the Future EFPAM was newly founded in November 2019 to be prepared for the future. EFPAM is now registered under Dutch law.

V.27International Coordination of Anthroposophic Age Culture and Elderly Care Since the end of 2018, the registered association for age culture Nikodemus Werk has had a new board of directors (consisting of Peter Wendt, Steffen Stern, Julian Schily and Ralf Lottmann), who trust in the initiative of its member institutions. The different national regulations for care of the elderly are a major challenge for coope - ration. The readiness of the member institutions to engage in further cooperation was confirmed at our most recent autumn meeting in November 2019. There is a new Nikodemus Werk Quality Certificate, which is equal to the previous quality seal of Nikodemus Werk in terms of anthroposophic content. Nursing care for the elderly is subject to constant and elaborate controls by Ger - many's home supervisory authority and the Health Insurance Medical Service (MDK ), as well as many other inspection bodies. In recent years, these tests and requirements have led to an ever-decreasing willingness to undergo a quality seal process in addition to that. For example, there was only one Nikodemus Werk ins - titution left at the end that wanted to continue the quality seal in its old form. This certification of quality is now focussing its attention exclusively on the develop - ment of anthroposophic content. The certification procedure is designed in such a way that a structured mutual collegial learning process can be carried out in the manner of a learning organisation. The aim is above all to enrich the institutions in a lively way, combined with very low costs for those involved. New forms of colla - boration and cooperation are thus starting to emerge -- also for the future. The strength of cohesion within Nikodemus Werk is also currently demonstra - ted by the fact that three other institutions are actively participating in the rescue of an institution that came close to shutting down. Since then, the chances of main - taining this facility have increased rapidly. These are extremely refreshing and en - couraging signals! Each Nikodemus Werk institution was given Rolf Heine's outstanding standard work on anthroposophic nursing practice (Anthroposophische Pflege) to mark the occa - sion of our 40th anniversary. One topic has kept us very busy in 2018 and 2019: the change from nursing training for the elderly to generalist nursing training. One hoped-for benefit is in - ternational comparability of nursing qualifications. Many colleagues from the ge - riatric care sector are still skeptical about this development, as two professional fields are being combined that could not be more different. According to new re - gulations, the profession is now called \"Nursing Specialist for Acute and Long- Term Care\". It was not possible to agree on a common approach among the insti - tutions and services. There is still three-year geriatric nursing training available, but this is ranked below that of generalist nursing training. It is not yet possible to assess whether the development of the combined occu - pational field of nursing care for the elderly and nursing care for long-term patients will succeed. Differences in payment and recognition are unlikely to be adjusted immediately, so that some are talking of a new 'nursing care crisis' that will hit the elderly. There are three geriatric nursing trainings that feel connected to anthroposophy Altenpflegehilfe in Fellbach). New Sabine Ringer International Coordination of Anthroposophic Age Culture and Elderly Care28quality inspection guidelines also came into force in 2019 and have obliged inpati - ent facilities to digitally map the residents according to certain criteria. There is a Data Analysis Unit ( DAS ) which will determine reference values and thus initiate comparability. This is also an exciting development. Some homes have looked into Advance Care Planning ( ACP). These are talks fi - nanced by health insurance companies, especially for old and chronically ill people, to determine their wishes and expectations for the last phase of life. This can be seen as a further development of living wills. International members are not yet regularly involved in our meetings. We have gladly accepted the request to create space for them in autumn, so that facilities which offer places to live for the elderly and the infirm can become visible internationally. In doing so, we are relying on contacts that Rolf Heine has built up over many years.

Our annual meeting in 2019 took stock of the six focus topics that we have been working on since 2016 (training for trainers, management and leadership trai - ning, publications, research, young coworkers, university work), collected ideas for the 100th anniversary of Rudolf Steiner's course on education for special needs in 2024 and set up a new working group on medicine in education for special needs and social therapy. This year's 'small' autumn conference was devoted to the seventh lecture of Rudolf Steiner's course on education for special needs, as well as the inner gesture of 'spirit beholding'. In addition to the integration of open work in the School of Spiritual Science and work by members of the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science on the professional esotericism of Rudolf Steiner's course on education for special needs at our annual meeting, regional initiatives in the School of Spiritual Science have also developed, which are accompanied by the Council's leadership team and class representatives. The active work of the social therapy working group continues. The Council is now responsible for the \"Future Now!\" conference series for students and young coworkers. The long-awaited internationalization of the journal Seelenpflege was suc - cessfully accomplished with the launch of its bilingual successor, Anthroposophic Per - spectives in Inclusive Social Development at the end of 2019. Training and Further Training This year's annual conference of the International Training Circle was devoted to the question of how the training and further training of trainers on methodo - Bart Vanmechelen, Sonja Zausch, Jan G\u00f6schel Leadership Team of the Anthroposophic Council for Inclusive Social Development29logical-didactic issues of contemporary adult education can be intensified through a stronger regional exchange between trainers and training centers to develop good practice. New training initiatives exist in Hungary, Mexico and Puerto Rico, among others, and are also supported by the Council's management team. Networking and Communication The Council's website has expanded from two languages (German and English) to four (Russian and Spanish) and is our core channel of communication within our network and beyond, in conjunction with our quarterly email newsletter, an RSS feed to Das Goetheanum and some major associations, our professional journal Perspectives, and our Facebook channel. Coordination and Contact Jan G\u00f6schel, j.goeschel@inclusivesocial.org Bart Vanmechelen, b.vanmechelen@inclusivesocial.org Sonja ( IFAN ) About 3500 nurses worldwide work in anthroposophic institutions such as clinics, homes for the elderly, outpatient nursing services, social therapeutic institutions, medical practices, Waldorf schools and private practice. At most one third of them have further training in anthroposophic nursing. The rest come into contact with it more or less 'on the job'. Anthroposophic nursing has a cultural mandate which goes beyond the provi - sion of staff to anthroposophic institutions. The aim is to teach people in health and illness an individual, sustainable, environmentally conscious and ultimately healthy lifestyle and thus support them in self-care and the care of their family members. In the direct nursing care of elderly, sick and needy people, anthroposophic nur - sing has methods to offer which can be effective on a small scale, largely independ - ently of external conditions. These methods must be practiced. They can hardly re - main viable without colleagues who share a friendly inner interest in development. Finally, the nursing techniques developed in anthroposophic nursing care, such as rhythmical inunctions, compresses and therapeutic washes and baths, have ope - ned up a further field of nursing activity. They are increasingly offered by nurses in private practice. The development tasks of the coming decade are to spread nursing culture in courses for non-professionals in the most diverse settings, develop inner nursing skills and resist automated work processes in the facilities of the so-called health care system, as well as training entrepreneurial handling of 'external applications'. The first steps in this direction were taken this year: we launched a manual for the recognition of lay courses in anthroposophic nursing. This should also open up a new, independent field of economic activity for nurses. The Vademecum of External Applications, which has been published online for almost five years and was also translated into Russian in 2019, is an important knowledge platform for nurses, Rolf Heine International Coordination of Anthroposophic Nursing30doctors and therapists. Together with expert training opportunities, it supports the independent handling of these highly efficient nursing care methods. Coordination and Contact Rolf Heine, rolf.heine@medsektion-goetheanum.ch Association of Anthroposophic Clinics The framework conditions for anthroposophic clinics in Germany, Switzerland and Sweden have been further restricted for smaller clinics by the DRG system (reimbursement system according to diagnosis-related groups in Germany and Switzerland) as well as mandatory health insurance recognition in Sweden and the quality requirements for complex therapies. For example, the Clinic Association had to accept the withdrawal of Richterswil Hospital, Casa di Cura Andrea Cristo- foro (both Switzerland) and Vidarklinik in J\u00e4rna (Sweden) in 2018. In Sweden, hos - pital operations could no longer be maintained. At the same time, the private clinic Sonneneck (Germany) rejoined as a member in 2018. The central theme of the Clinic Association in 2018 was the quality issue for Anthroposophic Medicine, with training and further training of nursing and medi - cal staff. In addition to basic qualifications in nursing (basic course) and among doctors (certification in Anthroposophic Medicine), we find a deficit in manage - ment skills, which are an indispensable prerequisite for successful leadership in an increasingly economically oriented health care system, and which is particularly evident in the lack of qualification of hospital managers. With an increasing shor - tage of skilled staff in the healthcare system, one cannot hope for sufficiently qua - lified personnel from the free labor market; they must be trained in the clinics themselves. In 2018, the Clinic Association therefore decided to establish a mana- gement development program for its member facilities, as an offer for joint ma - nagement training. In order to deepen knowledge of Anthroposophic Medicine in member hospitals, we also agreed on a joint specific clinical training program for doctors who have existing basic anthroposophic training. In order to expand and deepen anthroposophic therapies in our clinics, a wor - king group has been set up with the participation of the therapists' associations to evaluate and improve billing possibilities. The Clinic Association took up the further development of the quality seal for Anthroposophic Medicine (AnthroMed\u00ae) and further differentiated and expanded the certification criteria. All the larger member clinics are pursuing this Anthro - Med\u00ae certification at continuous intervals and are working on substance. Due to the economic situation of some member clinics, the budget of the asso - ciation could no longer be maintained, so that our joint editorship of the publica- tion medizin individuell could only be secured again for 2019 through a special allocation by certain hospitals and will be discontinued at the end of 2019. In the future - in agreement with the Medical Section - international in-depth courses in Anthroposophic Medicine are planned at the various clinics to further develop clinical expertise for graduates of the international IPMT s.

The sale of all the founding partners' shares - held by nine individual clinics of Anthroposophic Medicine - to an international association in Anthroposophic Medicine has now been completed. The Clinic Association agreed to acquire all shares on a fiduciary basis and to transfer them to international associations of An - throposophic Medicine acting as additional new shareholders in accordance with further consultations in the context of the Section. In December 2019 such a next step was taken and since then IVAA has also been a shareholder of AnthroMed gGmbH. Further associations may follow in 2020. At the shareholders' meeting in May 2019, in addition to these structural issues, the focus of the work, which had already been agreed upon in 2018, was concreti - zed to intensify public relations work internally, initially in the years 2019 and 2020. For this purpose, German and English versions of the AnthroMed\u00ae INFO October 2019 were compiled and made available for wide dissemination within the move - ment of Anthroposophic Medicine. Further arrangements for the work in the follo - wing years and for the successor of the IKAM representative for the AnthroMed\u00ae trademark were made in a consultation of the trademark's advisory board in early December 2019. Coordination and Contact Roland Bersdorf, roland.bersdorf@anthromed.net , www.anthromed.de International Coordination of Public Relations In 2019 there was a change in the public relations work of the Medical Section. After many years of working in this field, we bid farewell to Heike Sommer, with our heartfelt thanks. In August Ariane Totzke took over the public relations work with a changed job profile. The focus will now also be on science journalism. Initial Areas of Work Ariane Totzke began by redesigning and restructuring our Facebook account. In future, the aesthetics, form and content of our postings will follow a defined set of rules. Initial successes have already been achieved in this way. The post about the Medical Section's annual conference in 2019 generated a wide response: more than 17,000 people took note of it. Image and video material generally generates far more attention in social media than plain text: a video on inunctions for premature infants, recorded by Natalie Hurst and published on the Anthromedics portal, was played 36,000 times via our Facebook post. The posting of this video on Facebook also greatly increased the Roland Bersdorf Manager of AnthroMed\u00ae Ariane Totzke International Coordination of Scientific Journalism / Public Relations32number of clicks generated on anthromedics.org, so that a direct influx was ob- served. Colleagues from IKAM often provide material and announcements, so our social media channel is steadily growing. A further focus of work is the maintenance and redesign of the Medical Section's homepage, and here too a lot has already been achieved: numerous images have been replaced and two new tiles for the Anniversary Year 2020 have been added to the start page (with material provided from colleagues from around the world). Short journalistic articles were published in Anthroposophy Worldwide in the second half of the year. Networking Very good initial collaboration has been established with many colleagues, inclu - ding the Conference of Press and Public Relations Officers and Editors from an An - throposophic Environment (Ko PRa), the Umbrella Association for Anthroposophic Medicine in Germany ( DAMiD ), the Association of Anthroposophic Physicians in Germany ( GA\u00c4D ), the press office of Annette Bopp Hamburg, the communica- tions department at the Goetheanum, the eurythmy therapy training in Switzer - land, the International Coordination of Midwifery, and especially with colleagues in the International Coordination for Arts Therapy. Prospects Many contributions are planned for the Anniversary Year 2020 in various media, as well as events, anniversary exhibitions and video projects with colleagues. Coordination and Contact Ariane Totzke, ariane.totzke@medsektion-goetheanum.ch International Coordination of Anthroposophic Midwifery International Work In German-speaking countries, the Association for Anthroposophic Midwifery (www.vfah.de) connects many interested and experienced people through its training activities. 70 midwives completed an initial three-year extra-occupational course in 2018 and the second cycle is currently underway in Hamburg, with 40 par- ticipants. In Brazil, the little pearl Casa Angela (www.casaangela.org.br) is now radiant with enchanting midwives and women giving birth in S\u00e3o Paulo. Located in a favela, this community is courageously working for 'humane birth' ('parto huma- nizado' ), despite the prevailing Caesarian rate of over 80% in the area. Anthroposophic midwifery is spreading daily in the work of freelance midwives, who also accompany home births. In addition, anthroposophic clinics and midwife practices offer places for exchange and forums for learning. Midwives are increasingly working with different professional groups, which has resulted in increased training opportunities. Merja Riij\u00e4rvi International Coordination of Anthroposophic Midwifery33They were active and involved in many events in 2019: Eurythmy therapy in pregnancy (Filderstadt, Germany), CARE I conference (Dornach, Switzerland), International annual conference of the Medical Secton at the Goetheanum (Dornach), GA\u00c4D specialist course in anthroposophic gynecology (Filderstadt), \"We - from the beginning\" conference on pregnancy and birth as the basis for health (Stuttgart, Germany), Continuing physician training (Arlesheim, Switzerland). In terms of professional politics, midwives worldwide are faced with the dilemma of being a woman while also dealing with local working conditions. They have: Irregular working hours, but regularity in their own everyday lives, a lot of responsibility and sometimes high levels of stress, with an average remuneration that is not tolerable, high ethical standards with barely comprehensible risk management, with up to 95% interventions in delivery rooms. In Germany, this led to a considerable shortage of midwives from 2015 onwards and many women gave up the profession. The national health goal of midwifery was consequently redefined in response, and a political will for a salutogeneti- cally-oriented future has emerged. In addition, the WHO has dedicated the year 2020 to nurses and midwives. Both developments are very positive. Resource-oriented midwifery, as practiced by midwives, should be and remain a strong focus of anthroposophic midwifery work. For midwives, it is a challenge, in addition to the professional question (how can women give birth in a healthy, self-determined way, under tolerable conditi - ons and in the conditions that are specific to each culture?), to reflect again and again on how they can remain healthy and capable of working as midwives and as human beings, how they can guarantee themselves the possibility of having a fa - mily life and, on top of that, how they can become active in professional politics. This gives rise to many new and old problems and fields of work, which could and should be approached on the basis of an anthroposophic view of humanity. Coordination and Contact Merja Riij\u00e4rvi, merja.riijaervi@medsektion-ikam.org 34International Coordination of Anthroposophic Veterinary Medicine It is becoming increasingly clear that the relationships between humans and an - imals and between humans and nature are fundamental to true salutogenesis. Nu - trition plays a major role: thus, the physical feeding of animals is as important as the 'feeding' of the human soul through its relationship with the pet. How much do we need animals for our well-being? We are all talking about animal welfare in this century, in which animals have lost an existence with dignity and a life worth living like never before. But in truth animals reflect our own existence with all its negative facets. So how can we approach our farm animals, which can no longer live in the wild, but are trapped and kept in cages? How can we approach our pets that we enclose in our homes? Recognizing the simultaneous coexistence of culture and barbarism is the first step in dismantling the cages in which we enclose ourselves. Animals are the mirror of human beings, they are sacrificing themselves for this knowledge. Veterinarians heal sick animals, but also educate the animal owners to find reasonable relationships with them. Animal illnesses reveal much about the behaviour of their owners. Very often an anthroposophic veterinarian is consulted when there seems to be no other solution for an animal suffering from cancer, so that the owners get to know mistletoe therapy and other medicinal treatments and discover possibilities for themselves. The international coordination of anthroposophic veterinary medicine was esta - blished within the existing group of coordinators in the Medical Section in 2017. After initial meetings of the working groups, which were held during the Medi - cal Section's international annual conferences, we are now ready to give further impulses: The first international conference for anthroposophic veterinary medici - ne at the Goetheanum, \"Solutions and Questions of Anthroposophic Veterinary Medicine for Animal Diseases\" , will take place March, 20-22, 2020. Coordination and Contact Sabrina Menestrina, sabrina.menestrina@biodinamica.org Sabrina Menestrina Coordination of Anthroposophic Veterinary Medicine 35Financial Report for 2019 Looking back at our financial statements for 2018 (see p. 37), we can see that our expenses and income were a good 4% higher than budgeted, but that we only had to draw down slightly more than the promised contribution of TCHF 120 from the General Anthroposophical Society ( GAS). As in the past, three of our areas of work were largely based on donations from foundations, institutions and partners. One area concerned training and further training initiatives - essentially IPMT , eu- rythmy therapy training and eurythmy therapy training for doctors and medical students - whose expenses were covered about 57% by donations and 43% by the trainees and IPMT participants. In contrast, the basic financing of the Medical Section was almost 100% and the financing of the core projects CARE and Anthro - medics was fully carried by donations, for which we are very grateful to the foun- dations, institutions and partners, some of whom have faithfully supported us for many years. As in previous years, the response to our conferences and meetings was very encouraging. In particular, our 2018 annual conference on the subject of light met with a great deal of interest and is largely responsible for the fact that a surplus of around TCHF 33 was generated through conferences. One area of activity of the Medical Section which is still underfunded was and is the international coordinati - on of the individual professional groups within Anthroposophic Medicine ( IKAM ). Thanks to Mathias Hofmann's involvement in the IKAM secretariat, which was set up at the end of 2017, digitally based cooperation has become more professional and economical. In addition, the increasing worldwide spread and differentiation of anthropo - sophic therapies has generated a need for more people to coordinate the profes - sional fields within Anthroposophic Medicine. In 2018, only about 50% of these expenses were covered by contributions from associations, institutions or indivi - duals. A medium-term goal is to substantially improve this ratio between IKAM ex- penditure and contributions from those who benefit from the work of IKAM coor - dinators. Finally, we turn to the area of research and publications: this area was and is per se a subsidized area, as the sale of our publications and the low payments to authors cannot refinance the expenses associated with producing publications. In view of our unfortunately still quite limited readership, the editions are too small for this. Now, at the end of November, we can look back on quite a successful 2019 (see p. 37). First consider the financially relevant coworker changes: Heike Sommer left us at the end of May 2019, after twelve years of public relations work in the Medical Section. Two months later she was followed by Daniel Ginat, who had supported Heike Sommer as a student assistant in recent years, especially with regard to social media. At the end of July, we were happy and relieved to wel- come Ariane Totzke, who has been working in public relations since then - with a slightly modified profile that will place more emphasis on journalism. Johannes Weinzirl, with a 25% position since 2017 for the project to publish a new German edition of Rudolf Steiner's first course for doctors ( GA 312, the volume translated as Introducing Anthroposophical Medicine) and who was en- trusted with preparing contributions on the basics for www.anthromedics.org, Stefan Langhammer IPMT Coordination, Project Manager, Finances36reduced his workload to 10% in 2019, to focus on the doctors' course project and the planning of the World Conference 2020. One innovation that entailed noticeable additional costs for all Sections was the introduction of an infrastructure cost allocation for Section events at the Goe - theanum that require registration forms. The organizing Sections are asked to pay CHF 10.00 per day and conference participant to the Goetheanum to contribute the costs of operating the reception desk and stage. Of course, this is not a contri - bution that covers the actual costs of holding a conference in-house, but it does help to raise awareness for the effort required to hold an event - and where this may be out of proportion to the outcome. This infrastructure cost contribution is burdening the budget of the Medical Section by about TCHF 43 this year, which was partly offset by a moderate increase in conference fees, but also reduced the resulting income. Nevertheless, it is fore - seeable that the good attendance of our events means that a slight surplus will probably also be generated this year in the conference sector. A positive economic development was also evident regarding the 14 IPMT weeks, particularly through a noticeable reduction in costs. For example, as a re - sult of multiple honorarium waivers, the honorariums were almost 60% lower than in the previous year; the administrative expenses carried by the Medical Section were also noticeably reduced due to the growing independence of the organizational groups in the implementing countries, as described in our IPMT report. However, since the support from the foundations fell somewhat short of our hopes, the IPMT work will probably still end this year with a slight deficit of just under TCHF 10. The eurythmy therapy training courses will, as in previous years, be able to cover the expenses incurred through tuition fees and donations. Regarding economic developments in the area of international coordination, there is not much new to report compared to the previous year. As Carol Brousseau did a lot of translation work this year on publications related to the Section for which funds could be raised - she translated Rolf Heine's book on anthroposophic nursing practice into English - our publications sector will be able to close with a better result than last year. Since our planned core financing will in all probabi- lity be fully realized by the end of the year, it is foreseeable that the TCHF 120 contribution of the General Anthroposophical Society will help us to break even in 2019. The budget for the Anniversary Year 2020 (see p. 38) had to be set some- what higher than that of previous years, as the scope of activities of the Medical Section will be considerably greater than in 2019, due to our early childhood con - ference in the first half of June and especially in view of our full-week world confe - rence \"Crossing Bridges\" in September. We are very much looking forward to this jubilee year and are sure that if everyone continues to help so greatly, the financial basis will be given on which our Section work can continue to develop fruitfully! We would like to take this opportunity to thank all foundations, institutions, medicinal product manufacturers, associations and private donors for supporting our work!
