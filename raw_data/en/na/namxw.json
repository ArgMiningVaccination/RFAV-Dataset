SYSTEMATIC REVIEW Cost Effectiveness of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination for Men Who have Sex with Men; Reviewing the Available Evidence Didik Setiawan1,2Abrham online: 20 April 2018 /C211Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018 Abstract Background Men who have sex with men require special attention for human papillomavirus vaccination given ele- vated infection risks and the development of, in particular, anal cancer. Objective Our purpose was to review the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for both currently vaccine-eligible and non-eligible individuals, particularly the men-who-have-sex-with-men population, and synthe- size the available evidence.Methods We systematically searched for published articles in two main databases (PubMed and EMBASE). Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using a validated instrument (Bias in Economic Evaluation, ECOBIAS). Methodological aspects, study results, and sensitivity analyses were extracted and synthesized to generate a consistent overview of the cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination in the men-who-have-sex-with- men population. Results From 770 identied articles, four met the inclusion criteria. Across the studies, human papillomavirus vacci- nation showed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios rang- ing from dominant to US$96,146 and US$14,000 to US$18,200 for tertiary prevention and primary prevention, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio seemed most sensitive to vaccine efcacy, vaccine costs, and the incidence of anal cancer in the selected target populations. Conclusion This review presents the human papillo- mavirus vaccine, both as a primary and adjuvant (tertiary) vaccination, as a potentially cost-effective strategy for preventing mainly\u2014but not limited to only\u2014anal cancer in men-who-have-sex-with-men populations.Didik Setiawan Building 3214, 9713 AV Pharmacy, University of Muhammadiyah Purwokerto, Purwokerto, Indonesia 3Department of Health Sciences, University of University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Groningen, The Netherlands 4Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, National Infection Service, Public Health England, London, UK 5Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK 6Department of Economics, Econometrics & Finance; Faculty of Economics & Business, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands PharmacoEconomics (2018) 36:929-939 https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-018-0649-yKey Points for Decision Makers All the health economic studies included in this review considered human papillomavirus vaccination for men-who-have-sex-with-men to be cost effective or even cost saving. The specic target population and the exact setting for the intervention varied between the studiesidentied. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to vaccine efcacy, vaccine cost, and the incidence of anal cancer. There is a need for additional robust data and further studies for more countries. 1 Introduction Human papillomavirus (HPV) belongs to a group of DNA viruses [ 1]. Human papillomavirus concerns one of the most widely recognized, sexually transmitted viral infec- tions [ 2]. Based on their specic properties, HPV may result in anogenital warts (condyloma acuminata) [ 3] or cancers of the anogenital tract, i.e., anal and penile, and their precursor stages [ 2]. High-risk oncogenic HPV types (such as types 16 and 18) predispose to the development ofcancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, urethra, penis, anus, and oropharynx whereas low-risk types (such as types 6 and 11) are associated with warts [ 4-8]. Human papillomavirus causes considerable disease burden in both women and men [ 9]. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at a particularly higher risk of HPVinfections and related illnesses such as genital warts and anal cancer, as compared with heterosexual men [ 10]. A study revealed that the prevalence of HPV infection amongMSM is higher compared with men having sex with women [ 11-13]. Consistently, the incidence of anal cancer is substantially higher in MSM [ 14-18]. The burden is even more in HIV-positive MSM. A systematic review esti- mated that the annual anal cancer incidence in HIV-nega- tive MSM was 5 per 100,000 per year while it was 46 per100,000 per year in HIV-positive MSM [ 18]. There are currently three commercially available HPV vaccines, a bivalent, a quadravalent, and a nonavalentvaccine, with the rst two reflecting the 'older' products. The bivalent vaccine (Cervarix /C210manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) protects the quadravalent vaccine (Gardasil /C210, manufactured byMerck & Co.) provides protection against four types of HPV (6, 11, 16, and 18). The 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9/C210also manufactured by Merck & Co.) is designed to target ve more HPV types (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) inaddition to the four HPV types included in the quadravalent one [ 19]. It has been documented that HPV vaccines are effective in preventing HPV infection and related diseasesin men [ 20,21]. National HPV vaccination programs targeting girls between 9 and 14 years of age are in place in many countries. However, only a few countries such as Australia, USA, and Canada recommended a sex-neutral vaccinationprogram [ 22-24]. In particular, in settings where vaccine coverage among girls is poor, adding boys to the vacci- nation program can introduce benecial herd effects forunvaccinated women and obviously directly protect male individuals. In settings with high vaccination coverage among girls, male individuals would potentially benetfrom herd immunity and it appears that the addition of boys to a vaccination program might not be cost effective [ 25]. Furthermore, as the risk of anal cancer in the MSM pop-ulation is substantially elevated, targeted HPV vaccination of MSM is recommended to provide direct protection against HPV-associated cancers, and anogenital warts[26,27]. Additionally, HPV vaccines offer considerable protection against recurrent high-grade squamous intraep- ithelial lesions in this specic group [ 12,13]. Therefore, in this specic context, the vaccine seems to provide both primary (against infection) as well as tertiary (against advanced disease) prevention. The importance of cost effectiveness is increasing within the context of evidence-based decision-making processes. This review aims to analyze the cost effective-ness of HPV vaccination with the objective of primary and tertiary prevention among current vaccine-eligible and not eligible MSM, respectively. 2 Methods 2.1 Search Strategy A systematic search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases on 17 January, 2017. We ''boy'', and ''men''. Full details of the search strategy are available in the ''Appendix ''.930 D. Setiawan et al.2.2 Study Selection The search results were imported into Mendeley Desktop and duplicates removed. Then, titles and abstracts of the search results were screened independently by tworeviewers (DS and AW) to identify relevant articles. The full texts of potentially relevant articles were then assessed for eligibility. Studies investigating the cost effectivenessof targeted HPV vaccination of MSM were included. Reviews, editorials, letters, and articles not in English were also excluded. Discrepancies among the reviewers wereresolved by discussions and consensus. 2.3 Data ExtractionThe data were extracted by DS and AW independently, using a data abstraction template created in MicrosoftExcel /C210. The data were cross-checked by the same two authors for accuracy and consistency. The following data were extracted from each article: author(s), publicationyear, setting (country/location of the economic evaluation), the intervention and comparator(s) considered, type of model used, perspective, time horizon, discount rate forcosts and effects, cost and cost items for intervention and comparator groups, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and type and outcome of sensitivity analysis per-formed. To provide comparable calculations, all the mon- etary values were transformed into 2016 US$ using inflation rates and purchasing power parities from theWorld Bank database [ 28,29]. 2.4 Risk-of-Bias AssessmentThe risk of bias of the included studies was assessed by using the Bias in Economic Evaluation (ECOBIAS)checklist, consisting of 22 items specically intended for model-based studies [ 30]. This checklist is divided into two parts: an overall checklist for bias in the economic evalu-ation (part A) and a part considering bias in the model- specic aspects of the economic evaluation. In particular, the latter part (part B) covers potential bias related tostructure, model specication and time horizon considered, data, and internal consistency. 3 Results 3.1 Literature Search A total of 770 articles were initially found. Upon removal of duplicates, 612 articles remained and were screened. Of these 598 articles were excluded owing to the following reasons: not a health economic study (272 articles), not onMSM (84 articles), descriptive/observational study only (126 articles), review paper (70 articles), report only (31 articles), conference abstract (ve articles), correspondence (seven articles), and studies not on HPV infection (threearticles). Furthermore, of the remaining 14 articles eligible for full-text screening, ten were subsequently still excluded as they were not on vaccination in MSM populations.Finally, four articles were included in this review (Fig. 1). 3.2 Study CharacteristicsAll four studies considered vaccination strategies using the quadrivalent vaccine and targeting a different sub-popula- tion of MSM, dened by HIV status and age. Three studies originated from USA (US$27,28,30) and one from the UK[29]. Notably, two studies from Deshmukh et al. consid- ered the vaccination as a tertiary prevention strategy for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM who hadalready developed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [ 31,32] while two other studies evaluated the impact of vaccination as a primary prevention of infection[33,34]. Only one study considered genito-urinary medi- cine clinics as the delivery of the vaccination [ 34]. All studies used a lifetime time horizon. Most (75%) of thestudies were conducted from the perspective of the healthcare provider [ 31,32,34] and used Markov models [31-33]. Only one study implemented a dynamic transition model [ 34]. With regard to the discount rate for both costs and health effects, all studies from USA implemented a 3% discount rate [ 31-33] while the study from the UK implemented a 3.5% discount rate [ 34]. Anal cancer was considered in all studies. In addition, some studies also investigated anogenital warts [ 33,34] and other HPV-re- lated cancers including penile, oropharyngeal, oral cavity, and laryngeal cancers [ 34] (Table 1). 3.3 Base-Case Results The costs and health outcomes related to HPV vaccination for MSM are presented in Table 2. The currency year used in the studies ranged from 2006 to 2014; however, as mentioned, all being updated to 2016 US$. Direct medicalcosts, including treatment costs for the HPV-related out- comes considered were included. Quality-adjusted life- years (QALYs) were evaluated in all studies included[31-34], while incidence and mortality related to anal cancer were presented in three studies [ 31,32,34] and one study [ 32], respectively. Although HPV vaccination for MSM was the main question addressed in all included studies, there were differences in the specic and exact base-case analysis chosen. Three studies specically presented the values of dis- counted costs and utilities/QALYs for the individualCost Effectiveness of HPV Vaccination for Men 931options investigated in their analysis [ 31,32,34], while one study (Kim et al.) only presented the ICERs for the various scenarios covering different ages and exposures to HPVtype 6, 11, 16, and 18 infections [ 33]. Studies evaluating HPV vaccine for primary prevention showed that the ICER lies below US$20,000 [ 33,34] while two studies from Deshmukh et al., investigating tertiary prevention through (adjuvant) vaccination, showed varying results with the ICER at US$96,000 or even negative for HIV-negative andHIV-positive MSM, respectively [ 31,32]. Two studies showed that HPV vaccination for the MSM population, aiming to reduce the burden associated with anal cancer,would be a cost-effective strategy according to the sug- gested thresholds for USA and the UK of and \u00a320,000/QALYs (US$29,000/QALYs),respectively [ 33,34]. 3.4 Sensitivity AnalysisA sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the robust- ness of the study results considering methodological,structural, heterogeneity, and parameter uncertainty (Table 3). A deterministic and/or one-way sensitivity analysis was performed by all studies included in thisreview [ 31-34]. Most of the studies also performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Bayesian statistical decision theory to optimize the decision in relation to uncertainty in the data [ 31,32,34]. Based on the ndings from a one-way sensitivity analysis, the cost effectivenessof MSM HPV vaccination was found to be sensitive to vaccine efcacy, vaccine costs, and the incidence on anal cancer. 3.5 Risk-of-Bias Assessment According to part A of the ECOBIAS checklist (Table 4), there were some aspects that have been performed well, such as using the comparator reflecting current practice (novaccination for MSM), providing sufcient detail for the costs and ICER, applying recommended discount rates, and seemingly disclosing any sponsors related to the studiesperformed. However, there were several potential types of bias, according to the ECOBIAS checklist in the studies included in this review because most of the studies did notimplement the societal perspective in their studies [31,32,34], did not use input parameters, particularly cost and outcomes, that being collected continuously (longitu-dinal data) [ 31-34], did not mention nor present a fully detailed cost calculation [ 31,32,34], and did not use any specic pre-specied protocol while doing the study[31-34]. Various aspects of uncertainty were partially evaluated (mostly related to parameter uncertainty and heterogeneity) in the studies included [ 31-34]. In part B, the rst category of model-specic aspects of bias reflects bias related to structure, covering structural assumptions, treatment comparator, types of the model, and time horizon. Because two authors only developed one model in their study, potential bias could possibly occur Fig. 1 PRISMA flow diagram for articles selection in the study. HPV human papillomavirus, MSM men who have sex with men932 D. Setiawan et al.because the outcome generated from the model could not be compared with another model from the same natural history of the disease. The treatment comparator bias seemed optimally avoided because there were no currentHPV vaccination strategies for the MSM population. With regard to the model-type bias, only one study (Lin et al.) used a dynamic model that comprehensively described thetransmission of HPV infection in the population. Further- more, another consequence, including HPV-related cancers particularly in the MSM population, was also explained. Finally, bias related to a potentially limited time horizon was avoided because all the studies investigated the impactof HPV vaccination using a lifetime horizon. There were several potential biases related to the data used in the model because whereas all authors used datafrom well-designed studies, the justication on the process of deciding which data to include was lacking. Although the probabilities were adopted from well-establishedsources, the transformation process to align data with the model was not always clearly explained in the articles. The effectiveness of the vaccine used in the model was notderived from a meta-analysis but from single randomized clinical trials or non-concurrent cohort studies. Limited scope bias was also likely only partially avoided becauseall of the studies only evaluated the parameter and methodological uncertainty but not structural bias and heterogeneity. All studies seemingly avoided bias related tothe quality-of-life weights and non-transparent data incor- poration as the QALYs were derived from justiable sources and all data used in the model were clearlypresented. Internal consistency reflects an important factor to yield a good mathematical model for economic evaluation. Inthis review, only one study (Kim et al.) tested the model before they used it for the main study [ 33]. This testing process was achieved by incorporating several differentsets of parameter inputs and comparing the results with each other for consistency or comparing the output of the model with actual epidemiological data. 4 Discussion Human papillomavirus vaccination is widely known as oneof the main strategies to prevent HPV-related cancers.While universal vaccination programs for girls are com- mon in many countries [ 35-37], with potential indirect herd immunity benets to heterosexual boys, the MSMpopulation remains fully unprotected [ 9,16,38]. The scarce number of studies and settings identied, four studies exploring three different scenarios of vaccinationfor MSM populations, shows that HPV vaccination for MSM populations can potentially be a cost-effectiveTable 1 Study characteristics References Country settingVaccination objectiveTarget population Type of interventionComparator Type of economicevaluationPerspective, time horizonType of modelDiscount rate (%)Cancer types Cost preventionAged 16-40 yearsQuadrivalent vaccine for MSMNo vaccination for yearsDynamic 3.50 3.50 Anogenital warts, anal, penile, oropharyngeal, oral cavity, 3 Kim et al.

In the models, the potentially favorable cost effectiveness is mainly owing to, but not limited to, analcancer prevention [ 31-34]. This nding emphasizes the importance of expanding HPV vaccination policies for not only young-aged girls but also to other target populationssuch as MSM. Of course, the result of this review should be considered alongside other practical implementation con- siderations. Notably, in settings where vaccination for adolescent boys is considered not feasible [ 39], targetingMSM individuals aged 15-64 years could be considered acceptable [ 31,32,34]. From this review, we found that generally we can divide the studies into two groups: those targeting primary pre- vention and those targeting tertiary prevention using theHPV vaccine. Primary prevention aims to prevent the incidence of primarily anal cancer in the population at risk, particularly MSM. Primary prevention is aimed at avoiding the infection per se, while tertiary prevention specicallyTable 2 Cost and health characteristics of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for men who have sex with men (MSM) studies References Year of currencyCost component Health outcomeBase case Incremental ICER Authors' conclusions Costs (US$)Effects Deshmukh costIncidence, mortality, negative anal cancer and islikely to be a cost- effective intervention Lin et al.

While the results of primary prevention studies show favorable cost effectiveness, the outcomesfrom the tertiary prevention studies seem highly influenced by the HIV status of MSM. The ndings do show however that cost effectiveness provides justication for decisionmakers to expand the current vaccination program for mostly young-aged girls to MSM populations [ 40]. One study may provide relatively strong evidence because the authors used a dynamic transmission model [34], which captured the dynamic interaction among indi- viduals in the population and accounted for the impact of herd immunity within the MSM population itself [ 41-43]. Herd immunity is an important additional benet fromvaccination policies to societies and covers better the detailed impact of vaccination on clinical and economic issues. Although this study did not incorporate the herdeffects of vaccination to bisexual men, the ICER found in this study (US$20,461/QALY) was well below the will- ingness to pay for the UK (US$30,000/QALY). While adding HPV vaccination for young boys to girls' programs showed debatable cost effectiveness [ 44-46], expanding vaccination policies beyond the girls currentlycovered to all MSM populations in the society may be a favorable option as demonstrated by two different studies from Lin et al. and Kim et al. [ 33,34]. Both studies showed that the ICER for this extension lies below the recom- mended threshold for the countries considered (UK and USA). Hence, HPV vaccination policies for MSM popu-lations seem worth considering, in particular, as these individuals will not get the herd protection benets from existing female vaccination policies. Both studies from Deshmukh et al. [ 31,32] analyzed vaccinations for MSM who already developed and were treated for HGAIN to reduce recurrent HGAIN and thedevelopment of anal cancer. Notably, previous evidence showed that a quadrivalent vaccine could potentially reduce both the recurrence and the development of analcancer by almost 50% after the rst treatment of HGAIN [20]. Both studies showed that the strategy was likely cost effective or even potentially cost saving for HIV-negativeand HIV-positive MSM, respectively. These ndings were considered benecial for US decision makers should they want to expand the current vaccination strategies to bothHIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM who obtained the rst treatment of HGAIN in USA. To optimally underpin the decision-making process with high-quality research, bias should be avoided in any study. According to the ECOBIAS checklist, consisting of two parts (overall bias in economic evaluation and model-specic aspects) [ 30], there were some potential biases that could potentially occur. Notably, some issues may exist inthe identied studies with regard to using the societal perspectives, using data that are collected continuously, checking for double counting, and registering the protocol of the study upfront. These biases are common in economicevaluations owing to some limitations that generally exist, including unclear, incomplete, or unnecessarily reporting of indirect cost data, limited time for data collection, andscarce data availability. Additionally, unlike economic evaluations conducted alongside clinical trials, upfront formal protocols for model-based economic evaluations are still rarely made. Vaccine efcacy data used in health economic studies are generally never based on a formal meta-analysis. This lim- itation is possibly the result of the limited number of clinical trials or cohort studies on HPV vaccination in men [ 20], particularly in the MSM population because not all countries have specic healthcare services for this specic population. Another important consideration is that other types of pre-vention obviously exist, for example, using condoms as a means to prevent HPV infection and even other diseases. This has not been included in the studies reviewed. Suchalternatives may prove to be cost effective to prevent anal cancer or other types of sexually transmitted infections. Another important limitation of our review is the fact that studies come from two countries only, USA and the UK, which obviously does not necessarily represent the context for MSM populations in other developed countries, let alonedeveloping countries. Notably, economic evaluations are often seen as highly country specic, being closely related to the healthcare system in place. Moreover, there may beadditional cultural issues for MSMs, making the whole issue even more country-context specic. Studies for further countries are urgently needed as potentially expanding orintroducing HPV vaccination policies to and for MSM pop- ulations can potentially bring relevant benets and reduce the health and economic burden generated by HPV infection. 5 Concluding Remarks Scant evidence identied in our review (reflecting on fourstudies, two countries, and three different scenarios) indi-cates that HPV vaccination for MSM populations may be considered cost effective or can even be cost saving. Cost effectiveness appeared particularly sensitive to vaccineefcacy and vaccine costs. Given the scarcity of the evi- dence, it is difcult to make a denite and strong conclu- sion. Further research is needed to provide stronger modelinputs and evidence for more countries. Such country- specic studies on MSM populations will assist decision makers as to whether to expand or introduce HPV vacci-nation policies in their respective contexts.Cost Effectiveness of HPV Vaccination for Men 937Author contributions DS, AW, and MJP developed the research question and methodology, DS and AW performed the search term development, screening, and data extraction, and conducted the analysis.
