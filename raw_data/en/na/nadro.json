What is the indication and usage for VAQTA\u00ae (Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated)? VAQTA is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by hepatitis A virus in persons 12 months of age and older. The primary dose should be given at least 2 weeks prior to expected exposure to HAV. What is the recommended dosing for VAQTA\u00ae (Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated)? What is the recommended dosing for VAQTA\u00ae (Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated)? For children and adolescents 12 months through 18 years of age, vaccination with VAQTA consists of a 0.5-mL primary dose administered intramuscularly and a 0.5-mL booster dose administered intramuscularly 6 to 18 months later. For adults 19 years of age and older, vaccination with VAQTA consists of a 1-mL primary dose administered intramuscularly and a 1-mL booster dose administered intramuscularly 6 to 18 months later. What is the Select Safety Information for VAQTA\u00ae (Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated)? What is the Select Safety Information for VAQTA\u00ae (Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated)? Do not administer VAQTA to individuals with a history of immediate and/or severe allergic or hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis A vaccine, or to individuals who have had an anaphylactic reaction to any component of VAQTA, including neomycin. The vial stopper and the syringe plunger stopper and tip cap contain dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive individuals. The most common local adverse reactions and systemic adverse events (15%) reported in different clinical trials across different age groups when VAQTA was administered alone or concomitantly were: - Children 12 through 23 months of (37.0%), injection-site alone, and 27.0% when administered concomitantly). - Children/Adolescents 2 through 18 years of age: injection-site pain (18.7%). - Adults 19 years of age and older: injection-site pain, tenderness, or soreness (67.0%), injection site warmth (18.2%), and headache (16.1%). Safety and effectiveness in infants below 12 months of age have not been established. Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished immune response to VAQTA and may not be protected against HAV infection after vaccination. Hepatitis A virus has a relatively long incubation period (approximately 20 to 50 days). VAQTA may not prevent hepatitis A infection in individuals who have an unrecognized hepatitis A infection at the time of vaccination. In clinical trials in children, VAQTA was concomitantly administered with one or more of the following US-licensed vaccines: Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Conjugate). Safety and immunogenicity were similar for concomitantly administered vaccines compared to separately administered vaccines. VAQTA may be administered concomitantly with Immune Globulin, human, using separate sites and syringes. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies designed to evaluate VAQTA in pregnant women, including those 19 years of age or younger. Available post-approval data do not suggest an increased risk of miscarriage or major birth defects in women who received VAQTA during pregnancy. It is not known whether VAQTA is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of VAQTA on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VAQTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from VAQTA or from the underlying maternal condition. In clinical trials in adults, VAQTA was concomitantly administered with typhoid Vi polysaccharide and yellow fever vaccines. Safety and immunogenicity were similar for concomitantly administered vaccines compared to separately administered vaccines. The total duration of the protective effect of VAQTA in healthy vaccinees is unknown at present. Vaccination with VAQTA may not result in a protective response in all susceptible vaccinees.
