HIV/AIDS is an important health issue that trans people face, especially trans women of color. In SF, it's estimated that more than a third of adult trans women are living with HIV. An accepted and feasible intervention that delivers HIV prevention services with hormone therapy could significantly impact the HIV epidemic among trans women.9 PrEP Studies, Part 1: HPTN will HPTN 091 answer? Isoffering hormone therapy and HIV prevention services including the support of a peer health navigator in one location Acceptable? Feasible? And does it improve the use of HIV prevention services?
