We documented test res ults where the clostridia toxin markers, e.g. HPHPA, 4 - cresol have normalized from using Biocidin , either alone, or with other supplement remedies. All products are available from N ew Beginnings Nutritionals - http: //nbnus.com . Biocidin is http:// biobotanicalresearch .com . Protocol Outline : Biocidin - there are two options ( capsules or liquid ) for the Biocidin. 1 to 2 capsules three times daily or 5 to 10 drops of the liquid three times daily for 14 days. Then every 3 rd day thereafter give one day of dosing (three times per day as either the capsule or oral liquid) for an additional 4 weeks. Culturelle - 2 to 2 capsules daily (give at night away from the Biocidin). Continue until follow - up tests results are back. Another probiotic called Core - Biotic from Res earched Nutritio by New Beginnings Nutritio nals ) w orks well too. This c an be used i n stead of the Culturelle at 1 to 2 capsules nightly. Grapefruit Seed Extract (optional) - 5 to 10 drops in dilute juice three times daily throughout the entire course of treatment. Continue until follow - up tests results are back. o Can also use some other natural remed ies such as Garlic Extract (Allicin), Oreganol and Olive Leaf Extract. NOTE: It is recommended to repeat the Microbial Organic Acids Test or Organic Acids Test fr om Great Plains during the last week of the 6 - week protocol. Additional Options: The p rotocol o utline above has worked well overall, but clostridia bacteria and many time s accompanying yeast problems , are invasive and difficult to eradicate. Here are a few additional options for dosing natural remedies: 1. Extended program - use Biocidin, plus probiotics and other natural remedies for a longer period of time, e.g . 8 to 10 weeks . Ex: Give initial daily dose of Biocidin for 21 days, followed by every 3 rd day dosing for 6 to 8 weeks. 2. Multiple day cycling - another option for cycling is to use Biocidin every other day for 6 to 8 weeks. "}
