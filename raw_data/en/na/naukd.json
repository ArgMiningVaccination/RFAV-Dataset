The costs of maintaining aspecific standard of living and a thriving national economycan be controlled with wise energy choices and decisions. Theenergy and economic concepts contained in these lessons canhelp students in making those choices. LESSON 1:QUESTIONS ABOUT ENERGY CONCEPT:ConsumptionRECOMMENDED School.\" (Blackline mastersprovided) ECONOMICS IN THIS LESSON:Satisfying people's wants for goods (products) and services isthe main purpose of economic activity. The process of satisfyingwants is called consumption. People consume (use) goods and ser-vices to satisfy their economic wants.RATIONALE:As background for understanding the current energy situation it isimportant for students to understand that energy is a product thatpeople consume to meet certain needs. In this lesson two basicquests about energy consumption in this country are considered.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1.Recall some basic facts about energy consumption inthe U.S.2.Identify five uses of energy in the U.S.SUGGESTED TEACHING. PROCEDURE: A.Begin the lesson by putting the number \"306,000,000BTU's\" on the chalkboard. Have students spend a fewminutes guessing what this figure represents. B.Then ask \"Would it help if I told you this figureis equivalent to 2448 gallons of gasoline?\" Allowfor some more guessing. C.If they haven't already guessed tell students thatthe number represents the approximate amount of energyconsumed by every man, woman and child in the U.S.(Actually the figure is for 1982). To make the percapita energy consumption figure more meaningful to 310 students have them calculate, how long 2448 gallonsof gasoline w)uld keep a car running, assuming itused 20 gallons a week. D.Project the transparency \"Energy Consumption PerCapita, 1950-1982\". Have students determine whatthe graph is about by: 1.inspecting the graph title.2.checking the graph source, and3.examining the information on the graph.They should respond something like: It is a line graphbased on information from the U.S. Energy InformationAdministration, about energy consumption in the U.S.The Information is for 1950-1982 and is given percapita.Energy information is given in millions ofBTU's per capita. E.Then ask students to discover the trend in energy con-sumption that is shown on the graph. Has consumptionper capita increased between 1950 and 1982? Was ita show steady increase or did it increase in jumps?The students should respond that consumption percapita did increase during the period 1950-1979.A big jump occurred between 1965 and 1970. Since1979, consumption per capita has decreased. F.Say that the class has seen how much energy is usedor consumed in the United States sLT a year. Then saysomething like \"Now let's brainstorm about how energyis used in this country. Name as many different usesfor energy as you can.\"NOTE:Write the rules for Braimptorming on the blackboard.Be sure students are aware of rules before brain-storming begins.Rules for Brainstorming 1.In brainstorming every idea, however crazy it maysound, is welcome.2.No one should criticize anyone's ideas! In otherwords, no comments, no laughter, no funny looks.3.The goal of brainstorming is for the group to pro-duce as many ideas as possible. Original, zanyideas are welcome.4.\"Hitchhiking\" is desirable. That is, if a goodidea comes by, pick it up and add to it. G.List student responses on chalkboard. Do not edit re-sponses.(Set a time limit, probably not more than20 minutes.) H.Have the class catagorize energy uses by type. (Theymight catagorize uses into transportation, householduse, industrial use, etc. Let students decide on their 'own catagories.) I.To end the lesson, say something like \"If all the energyuses you thought of were grouped into four major cata-gories:transportation, residential, industrial andcommercial, which catagory would use the most energy, which would use the least?\" Record student responses on the chalkboard. Then project the transparency:\"Breakdown of U.S. Energy Consumption.\" Who was right.?NOTE:While the data on the transparency is from 1968, thepercentages in the four catagories apply with littlechange today.SUGGESTED EVALUATION STRATEGY 1.Develop a set of true/false questions dealing with energyconsumption per capita, trend in consumption, and uses ofenergy.Use information in the lesson to generate thesequestions. 2.Have students list several uses for energy. Have themidentify which are transportation, residential, commercial,and industrial uses.SPIN OFF(This activity is adapted from \"Energy Trade Offs in the MarketPlace\")To extend this lesson on energy consumption you might want stu-dents to consider the following activity that focuses on pro-posals to reduce energy consumption. The following procedureis suggested: A.Explain to the students that the school administra-tion has decided to help reduce gasoline consump-tion in this country. It feels that the mosteffective way would be to discourage studentsform driving to schools. To accomplish thisgoal the administration plans to implement oneif three proposed policies. Students are beingasked to evaluate these proposals, before one isselected for implementation. B.Handout copies of \"Three Proposals to Reduce Gaso-line Consumption in Our School.\" Ask students toread the proposals carefully. C.Divide the class into small groups (3-5 studentseach) D-Ask each.group to look over the three plans andchoose one they feel is most fair toimplement. E.Have each group identify'what will be gained bytheir decision and what willbe lost. They shouldidentify also which peOple will benefit most andwho will have to make the greatest sacrifice. F.Have a spokesperson from each group explain theirdecision td the class. G.Conduct a class discussion comparing ,the differentchoices made by the groups and evaluating theirreasons forthe decision.Special attentionshould be given to exploring different meaningsof what is \"fair\" (see Step Dy.

Only teachers and school staff would be allowed to park on school property. All cars violoating this plan would be towed away at the expense of the owner. It is as- sumed that students would no longer drive to school if they are not allowed to park in the school parking lots.Studelts will be allowed to park on school property if they are willing to pay $4 per day for the privilege. If a large number of students continue to use the parking lot, the price will be raised until it is too expensive for most students to park on school grounds. This plan allows students who have the greatest need to drive a personal car toschool to pay for that privilege.The administration will distribute parking permits to students who need to drive to school. The total number of permits would be 1/3 of all present parking spaces at the school. Preference would be given to studentson the basis of the following priorities: 1.Handicapped students2.Working students3.Drivers who transport at least three additionalstudents LESSON activity sheets (included) ECONOMICS IN THIS LESSON:Before goods (e.g., gasoline) and services can be consumed, they must be produced. For this to happen productive resources are necessary.Productive resources constitute the input of pro- duction.Natural resources are one type of productive resource. They are'elements of the natural environment that are used to produce goods and services and thereby help people meet their needs.Natural resources include land, water, oil and mineral deposits, the fertility of the soil, climates suitable for growing crops, timber and so on. Some pf these resources are non-renewable. These are used up in' the process of production. Others renew themselves or can be renewed through human effort.These are renewable natural resources.RATIONALE:--- As a background for understandingourCUrrent energy situation, it is important for_studentl to realize that most energy sourcesnow being_,us-ed-fri this country are non-renewable; they are being _depleted as they are used to produce energy.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1.Identify the characteristics of a natural resource;2.Distinguish between renewable and non-renewable re- sources;3.List the natural resources that are currently our main energy sources;4.Characterize current energy sources as renewable or non-renewable;5.Describe some implications of our dependence on non- renewable energy sources. 411SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE: A.Have students read through paragraphs 1-4 in thestudent materials. 1317 B.As a class, review the characteristics of a naturalresource (paragraph 1). Record the characteristicson the chalkboard: 1.A natural resource is an element of the naturalenvironment.2.It is used to produce something that people useto satisfy needs.C.Review the examples of natural resources in paragraph2 and 3 and t:he \"non-example\" of a natural resource in paragraph 4.(A tornado is a \"natural hazard\". It is introduced here to show that not every element of the natural environment is a natural resource.)D.Have students examire the list in paragraph 5 andidentify the natural resources on the list.They should respond: copper, petroleum, wind, soil, water and natural gas. (There might be some debate 0! about whether or not wind is a natural resource. It depends on velocity. If there is too little or toomuch velocity, wind is not a natural resource. In -between these extremes it. can be harnessed to_pro,----duce useable energy, so it is a_nuria-1---re-SbUrce).. E.Have studs answer the question posed in paragraph-6-.---Avariety of responses are possible.F.To complete this section of the lesson, have studentsprovide other examples of natural resources.In each case they should be asked what the resource is usedto produce.G.Have students read through paragraphs 7-10.H.As a class, review the characteristics of renewableand non-renewable natural resources (paragraphs 7 and9).Record the characteristics on the chalkboard.Renewable Non-Renewableoelement of the naturalenvironmentoused to produce thingspeople use to satisfyneedsothe current stock can beused up; but supply canbe replenished or replaced 1814oelement of the naturalenvironmentoused to produce thingspeople use to satisfyneedsocannot restored; canbe used up; supply isdepleted when used I.After reviewing the examples of paragraphs 8 and 10,have students give other examples of renewable andnon-renewable natural resources. In each case theyshould be asked to explain why it is renewable ornon-renewable. J.Before students examine the pie graph, you might wantto review the material in paragraphs 11 and 12 as aclass.ParagrAph 11 is a reminder of what a pie graphshows.Paragraph 12 outlines a procedure for deter-mining what a pie graph is about. K.Have students answer the question posed in paragraph 1;12.They should say something like \"This is a piegraph about the natural resources used to produceenergy in this country, in 1982. The graph showswhat portion of all energy produced was contributed--by each natural resource. 4_1s-based-on informa-tion from th_e Depart-metaOf Energy.\"Have follow the inparagraph 13 and 14. (Note:Some students may notrealize that water is used to produce electricity.Also in some situations it may be necessary forstudents to do some research in order to determinehow to group these resources.) Their lists and cal-culations should look like this:Renewable Non-RenewableWater3.8%Domestic petroleum 25.9%Imported petroleum 17.2Domestic gas 1.2Domestic coal 22.43.8% 96.2% IHave students list what they have learned about energysources now used (paragraph 15). The listing can bedone as an individual assignment or as a group activity.Students should come up with findings like: 1.Only five different natural resources are usedto produce almost all our energy at the presenttime.2.Most of our energy is produaced from non-renewableresources.3.Coal, natural gas and petroleum account for over90% of our energy sources. 1519 N.In paragraph 16 students are asked to speculate aboutthe meaning of what they have learned. You might be-gin by listing what students learned about energysources on the board. Then let them generate ques-tions for an energy production expert. They mightask things like:oWhen will our current energy sources run out ifwe keep using them at the same rate?oWhat is being done to develop renewable energysources?oAre new supplies of our non-renewable energysources being found?oWhat is-being done to assure a supply of energyif our current non-renewable sources run out?SUGGESTED EVALUATION STRATEGY:-Ask students to define a natural resourcejHave themgive an example and explain why it is a natural resource. .2.Ask the students to list 3 characteristics of renewableresources and of non-renewable resources. 3.Give students a list of natural resources not previouslyseen. Have them distinguish between renewable and non-renewable ones. 4.Give students a list of 10 possible energy sources. Havethem characterize these sources as renewable or non-renewable411Then have them identify which 5 sources on the list are cur-rently our major energy sources. 5.Have students write a short paragraph describing some ofthe possible consequences of our dependence on non-renew-able energy soures.SPIN OFFO In this lesson, students considered the natural resources usedto produce energy. They saw that most of these resources werenon-renewable. To extend this lesson you might have studentsweigh the pro's and con's of a policy that might be proposed inresponse to this situation. The following procedure is suggested.*A.Introduce the activity by saying that students willbe asked to analyze a policy that might be proposedin response to our current dependence on non-renew-able resources as energy sources. *This activity is based on an activity in \"Energy Trade Offsin the Market Place.\" B,Write the following proposed policy on the chalk- board \"The federal government should levy taxes to subsidize development and use of an alternative, re- newable energysource (like hydrogen, wind or solarenergy.)\"C.Have students, as a class, suggest positive (good) and negative (bad) effects that would result from the implementation of this policy.Accept all rea- sonable answers. Record suggestions on the chalk- board.Combine those that overlap.D.Divide the class into small groups of 3-5. Assign each group the following tasks:i)As a group identify the three most important positive and negative effects on the list developed by the class.ii)Explain why the group thinks these are the most important.iii) Decide which groups in society might also thinkthat these were the most important positive and negative effects. Explain why these societal groups were chosen.Have groups report their responses to their classmates. Encourage students to focus on differences of opinion among groups with respect to pgsitive and negativeeffects identified as important and on why these'dif- ferences exist. 1721. STUDENT MATERIALS: OUR CURRENT ENFRGY SOURCES 1,A natural resource is an element of'the natural environment.It is use-a To produce something. People use the things pro'-dueed from natural resources to satisfy their needs.A tree is a natural resource. It is an element of thenatural environment that is used to build houses, to buildcooking fires, and to makepaper. Houses, cooking fires,and paper, in turn, are used by people to satisfy their needs. 3.Iron ore is also a natural resource. It is an element of thenatural environment that is used to make steel. People usesteel to satisfy many different needs. 4.Is a tornado a natural resource? It is an element of thenatural environment. But it is not used to produce anything the people use to satisfy their needs. So a tornadois not a natural resource. 5.Identify the natural resources in the following list:blizzard hailstonescopper soilpetroleum waterwind locustsearthquake natural gas 6.What is each natural resource on your list used to produce? 7.Sometimes it is useful to distinguish between two kinds ofnatural resources. One kind is called a renewable naturalresource. This means that the supply of the natural re-source can be replaced or restored as it is used. 8.When a forest is cut down it will grow again. The ferti-lity of soil can be restored when it is exhausted. Soilcan be restored naturally or by human effort. When thesupply of water in a well is low, rains come to replenishit. Forests, soil and water are examples of renewable re- sources. 9.Other natural resources are non-renewable. They can be usedup 10.Iron-ore and copper are examples of non-renewable resources. As they are used to produce things like steel and wire, theycan not be replenished. The earth's supply of these naturalresources becomes less and less as they are used. 11.Examine the following pie graph. Remember that in a pie graph the pie is used to represent a whole. \"Slices\" are rawn to show the portions of the whole. The size of eachslice shows how much that portion contributes to the whole,22:18 12.What is the pie graph about? To answer this question, inspect the graph title, Check the graph source, and examine the information-TTI-eaa \"slice\" of the pie graph.NATURAL RESOURCES USED TO PRODUCE ENERGY IN THE U.S. 1982 123 13.To learn what the pie graph says, begin by making two lists.Place all the renewable natural resources shown on the piegraph on one list. Place the non-renewable energy sourceson the other list. 14.Then, calculate what portion of all the energy produced inthe U.S. in 1982 came from renewable natural resources.What portion came from non-renewable sources?15.List two things that you have learned from the pie graphabout natural resources now used to produce energy in theU.S: 16.In this lesson, you have learned some things about our pre-sent energy sources. In view of what you have learned, whatare some questions you would ask an energy production expert(economist), if he/she visited your class? 24t. .4120 LESSON 3:WHAT IS NEEDED TO capital, REQUIRED: One class period'MATERIALS REQUIRED: This lesson begins with the teacher demon-strating the production of an item. In thisoutline the production of a \"bookend\" is46,featured.But you can make almost anythingas long as it involves clear, simple examplesof labor, capital goods, and regources (seebelow for definitions of these terms).If you decide to make a bookend, you will need:o hammero nailso 2 pieces of wood (get two pieces of scrap from the .school shop instructor that are the same width (sayabout 5\") and between 5\" and 8\" long. You can nailthese together to form a crude bookend.Also needed for this lesson is the student worksheet\"Using the Factors of Production to Get Energy.\" Ablackline master is provided. ECONOMICS IN THIS LESSON:Before goods (e.g., gasoline) and services can be consumed, they must be produced. For this to happen productive re-sources (also called factors of production) are necessary.Productive resources are the inputs to production. Goodsand services are the outputs.There are three kinds of productive resources.Natural re-sources are elements of the natural environment that areused to produce gobds and service_ aNatural resources in-clude land, water, oil and mineraT\"deposits, the fertilityof the soil, climates suitable for growing crops, timber and so on.Human resources (labor) are people and their physical andmental capacities. The number of people available for work,the hours they work, the quality of their skills and theirmotivation are all dimensions of labor input.Capital goods are those things created by past human effortthat are available to produce goods and services in thefuture.They include machines, tools and factories. 2125 RATIONALE.As a background for understanding issues related to theproduction of energy, it is important for students tounderstand that the production of any good involves in-puts of natural resources, capital goods and labor.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES':On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1.Identify the characteristics of the three factorsof production;2.Distinguish among examples of labor, capital, andnatural resources;3.Illustrate the need for all three factors in theproduction of energy.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE A.'Lou might begin the class by saying:\"You know,I need a bookend. People always need onething or another. So what do they do? They go outand buy it, or they find someone to make it for them.Sometimes they can make it themselves. That's whatI'm going to do. I'm going to make a bookend.\"\"To make my bookend, I'll use this wood. I'll nailthese two pieces together with my hammer. Maybe oneof you can hold the pieces, while I nail. OK, hereis my bookend.\" B.Ask students \"What was needed to build the bookendthat you just made?\" Have them answer as a class.Write answers on the blackboard. They might respond:\"You had to nail the pieces of wood together\"\"You needed wood.\"\"Work had to be done.\"\"You used a hammer.\"\"You had to have something to make the bookend out of.\"\"You needed tools.\"\"You used nails.\" C.When the students run out of suggestions, point outthat building this bookend was a simple project. Itwas like all production projects. The same threethings are needed to produce all goods. Write themon the board along with definitions: i.Labor:human time and effortiiNatural Resources: Things we take from nature,like ores, air, water, and sunshine. D)iiiCapital Goods: Things people have made in thepast that-fFiy can now use to make more Lhings,like factories, saws and can openers.These are called, the factors of production. Anythingthat is produced requIiiifhe input of all three.Next use one statement from the student list (generatedin response to the questions in Step B, above) to illu-strate each of the three factors of production. Youmight chose:Labor:\"You had to nail the pieces of wood needed wood.\"Capital Goods: \"You used the students categorize the, other statements onthe list as examples of labor, natural resources, orcapital goods. They should respond:Labor:\"Work had to be done. \"'Natural Resources: \"You had the Factors of Productionto Energy\". Have students read the direct :.ons foreach section.Then do the first examples from sectionA and section B, as a class Students should respond:Section A, Question 1 -.Sawing the Wood into chunksis labor.Section. B, Question 7 - Labor: Felling the trees,cutting the wood, stackingit, stoking the stove, clean-ing the chimney, removing ashes.Capital:Ax, chain, chimney, stove, shovel,ash Resources: wood.NOTE:Answers given here for Section B are typical.,There are other answers that are equally correct. 2327 G.Ask students to complete the worksheet, during theremainder of the class period. Circulate and checkanswers.(You might want students to work in pairs.)Students might respond as follows:Section AQuestion:2. Tanker trucks are capital resources.3. The pipeline system is a capital resource.Question:-4. The plumber's work in installing thesystem is labor.5. The drilling rig is capital equipment.It is a tool people made.6. The dam, turbine, and generator arecapital equipment.Section BQuestion:8. Labor: Work of plar. ngineers, nuclear power plant, thetransmission and distribution system,thetoaster.Going farther back in the nuc-lear fuel cycle. other capital equipmentrequired would include the equipment atthe uranium mine and the milling and en-richment facilities.Natural resource: uranium.9. Labor: Work of the factory workers.capital: factory building itself, theMating pots and other equipment.Natural resources: Natural gas, sand, otheringredients in the glass.10. Labor: Workers on the rig, refinery workers,1-i6ktruck driver, service station attendant.Capital:ships, rig, tank truck.Natural resources: Crude oil.SUGGESTED EVALUATION STRATplr 1.Ask students to define labor, capital goods, and natural re- sources.Have them give an'example of each. 2.Have students answer questions similar to those posed inSection A of the student worksheet,\"Using the Factors ofProduction to Get Energy.\" 2824 For example: To do this...1. Fly from Chicago YorkRequires this... oil refinery workersrun refineryWhat is it? (ansWer-Labor) 2. Truck beef to market crude oil (Natural iesource) 3. Make glassware Natural gas (Natural resource) 4. Cook a meal on a gas stove watching the pot (Labor) 5. Pump water with windmill wind (Natliral resource) 3.Have students answer questions similar to those in Section Bof the student worksheet \"Using the Factors of Production toGet Energy.\"For example:A farmer windmill to crops.Labor: (Answer-maintain windmill)Capital: (Pump, tower, windmillblades)Natural Resource: (wind. Also other resources wereused to create capital resources andin obtaining energy from wind)Two kids watch TV. The electricity comes from a powerplant burning coal that was mined underground hundredsof miles away.'Labor:(coal miner, power plant workers, linemen)Capital: (coal miner equipment, railroad, power plant,electricity wires)Natural Resource: (coal, water for cooling, air for com-bustion),SPIN OFFHave students collect articles describing the production of energyin different historical periods or in different parts of the world.Have students identify the labor, capital, and natural resourceinputs used to produce energy in each case. WORKSHEETUSING THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION TO GET ENERGYREMEMBER:LABOR is people's time and,effort.CAPITAL is anything people have made in the past that canbe used to make more goods and services. A hammer is capi-tal, and so is a truck, a factory, \"ur a road.NATURAL RESOURCES are things we take from nature, like ores,water, air, and sunshine.SECTION A:Listed below are some ways people can get energy. Toobtain this energy, it is necessary to use labor, cap-ital, and natural resources. Write either \"labor,\"\"capital,\" or \"natural resource\" in the blank spaceat the end of, each line, to describe what the thiu,in the second column is.To do this... Requires this... What is it?1. Heat a home with a sawing wood into chunkswood stove2. Heat a home withfuel oilTanker truck 3. Heat a home with Anatural 'gaspipeline system 4. Heat a home with a installation by plumbersolar collector5. Move a car using drilling riggasoline 6.

ECONOMICS IN THIS LESSON:For most goods and services there are other goods and services that may satisfy very nearly the same needs. These other goods and services are called substitutes. When the real price of :'agood or service, traditionally; used, is the same as or higher than tla real price of a substitute, producers and consumers, demand more of the substitutes.RATIONALE:Supplies of our traditional energy sources, especially oil and natural gas, are dwindling. As this happens, their prices willrise.Dwindling supplies and high prices encourage producers and consumers to consider substitutes - what are usually called'alternative sources of energy.\"This lesson helps students begin to identify criteria useful in comparing energy alternatives. They also have an opportunity toapply these criteria to the comparison of specific energy alter- natives.To keep this lesson manageable, only coal and nuclearpower are compared. However as is suggested in the spin off activity, a variety of other energy alternatives can be com-pared, using the criteria developed in this lesson.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1.Identify three criteria that are useful in comparingalternate energy sources;2.Use these criteria to compare some energy sources. 2932 SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE:NOTE:In this lesson students will participate in a simu- iiiion.The simulation revolves around the meeting ofthe Board of Directors of an electrical utility. Theyare trying to choose between building a coal or a nu-clear powered -,enerating plant.A.To begin this lepson, have students read,the \"Back-ground\" handout. Review the basic facts as a clas i)A study shows that in 10 years electricityproduction will not match anticipated consum,Lion.ii)Board Members decide to build another largeplant.iii)Building an oil powered plant is too expen-sive.iv)They must choose an energy source for theplant:coal or nucldar.NOTE:Other energy alternatives like solar,iaTia, etc.are not yet able to generate 500MWin one place.Research teams were hired to collect informa-tion about these options.vi)As the,simulation begins, that information hasbeen collected, and people are preparing for ameeting.NOTE:Three groups with 3-5 students each are needed to pay this simulation. If there are more than 15 studentsin your class, which is very likely, you will want to di- vide the class in half andllave two simulations going simultaneously. This is preferable to having some people participate and others watch. B.With the note above in mind, divide the class (or half class) into three groups with 3-5 students in each. Assign one group the task of serving as the Board of Directors.As#ign a secondgroup,.-the task of serving as the \"coal\" research team. The third group will bethe \"nuclear power\" research team.oEach member of the,,Board of Directors group should receive:i) a copy of the appropriate role description; ii) a copy of the memo from the state energy group; ,iii) a copy of the Agenda. 3330 oEach member of the two research teams should receive:i) a copy of the appropriate role description;ii) a copy of the appropriate energy sourceinformation sheet;iii) a copy of the Agenda.oGive the groups a set amount of time to completethe meeting preparation task described on the rolecards.The amount of time needed will vary fromclass to class but 1-2 class periods are appro- priate.oBe sure each group knows what is expected of it,before the meeting (Executive Session) begins.C.When everyone is prepared, the Executive Session of theMetro Power and Light Company Board of Directorsshould begin.Events should follow the agenda, alreadydistributed to students.oThe Chair of the Board opens the session, states theproblem, introduces and distributes copies of theMemo:\"Important. Things to Consider When ComparingEnergy Sources.\"NOTE:Instruct class members to fill out the chart on aiie formsas presentations are made.oThe Chair introduces the representatives of theresearch teams, they distribute information sheetsand make presentations.oBoard members may question representatives who mayconfer with other members of their research teams,if necessary, to answer.oAfter all reports are presented and questions areposed, the Board members must debate among them-selves the merits of the two sources presented.This should take place in the presence of all, butmust proceed without further reference to the re-search teams.oThe Board should then retreat to make its final de-cesion.The Board's decision could be announced ina variety of ways - in a classic \"form letter,\" inthe school newsletter or newspaper, etc. Usuallysuch an announcement contains some form of rationale,an opportunity this Board will likely want to exploit.NOTE:You can decide what form the final decision should takeor let the Board decide. SUGGESTED EVALUATION PROCEDURE:To conclude this lesson, have students complete the \"Review Sheet.\"11,This can be assigned as an in-class activity or as,homework. Youmight consider using student answers to these questions to measurewhat they learned in this lesson. In any case, student answers tothese questions should be discussed as a group to end the lesson.SPIN OFFYou might have students examine a number of alternative sources ofenergy not considered in this lesson, using the criteria developedhere as a framework.A reasonable task would be to compare 3 energy alternatives thatcan be used to produce electricity, using the chart developed inthis lesson.The FREE AND INEXPENSIVE RESOURCES SECTION for thisunit lists several sources of information for this task. AftBACKGROUND Last year the Metro Power and Light Company (MPLC) conducted a study.The purpose of the study was to estimate future electri-city needs in the region served by MPLC. The study showed that in 10 years there would be a problem.Electricity productionwould fall short of expected consumption by 500 megawatts (MW).In the past MPLC always solved its energy problems in the same. way.It built a new electric generating plant that used oil forfue,l.But now the price of oil is so high that another solutionmust be found.The MPLC Board of Directors reviewed the study of future electri-city consumption in the region. They quickly decided to buildanother big electrical generating plant to provide the additional500 MW of energy needed.The Board of Directors knew something about energy alternatives. ;They realized that only two possible energy sources could be usedto power such a plant in the next several years. They would haveto choose between nuclear energy and coal. But which one should they choose?Most of their experience had been with oil powered plants. So/the ,Board of Directors of MPLC felt that they could not choose'between coal and nuclear energy, without more information.The Board hired a consulting company to gather information concern-ing advantages and disadvantages of both options. The const4tingcompany used teams of researchers to collect the information. Thatinformation has now been gathered.1Board members and research teams are preparing for a meeting atwhich the information will be presented. Questions will ble askedand answered, and a decision will be made... 3336O. ROLE DESCRIPTIONBoard of Directors As members of the Board of Directors of the Metro Power andLight Company, you have several tasks: 1.Carefully read the memo from the State Energy Group. 2.Use the information in the memo and ideas from otherBoard members to develop your own list of 'importantthings to consider when comparing energy sources.\" 3.Write each thing on your list in a box at the top ofthe chart that appears at the end of the memo. Makeenough copies of the chart to distribute at the meeting(See Agenda). 4.You will use this list to examine information presentedat the Executive Session of the Board of Directors.You will use this list to help decide whether to builda coal or nuclear powered generating, plant. 6.Choose a Chairperson for the Board, When the 4xecutiveSession of the Board is held the Chairperson will:oopen the sessionostate the problem facing the Boardointroduce the yesearch team representatives. 7.Ask questions when research team presentations are made. 8.Participate in the debate that follows presentations. 9.Announce your decision as a Board. ROLE DESCRIPTIONResearch Team As members of a research team you have several tasks: 1.Carefully read the energy source information sheet that you received. 2.As a group decide how to present this information at theExecutive Session of the Board of Directors (see Agenda). 3.Your presentation should emphasize advantages and disadvan-tages of the energy source your team \"researched.\"4.Choose a representative of your team to make the presenta-tion.He/she will also handout copies of your informationsheet at the Executive Session. He/she will answer questionsasked by Board members, with your help. 35389 AGENDAExecutive Session of the Board of DirectorsMetro Power and Light Company 1.Chair calls the meeting to order 2.Chair makes opening remarks and distributes copies of Memo:\"Important Things to Confiider When Comparing Energy Sources\"3.Chair introduces representative of coal research team.Distribution of information sheet and presentation4.Board asks questions of coal team 5.Procedure repeated for nuclear research team 6.Board members debate options 7.Board retreats to make final decision 8.Adjournment '41 3936 MEMO\"IMPORTANT THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN COMPARING ENERGY ALTERNATIVES\" TO:Board of Directors, Metro Power and Light CompanyFROM:State Energy Group We understand that you are building a new generating plant. We understand further that you must choose between two energy sources to power the plant. Our experience shows that there are certain things that you should consider when comparing energy sources.1.AVAILABLE SUPPLY - The available supply of our present major energy source, oil, is dwindling. It is becoming increasingly expensive to use.To keep the cost of pro-' duction down, you will want to use lower priced alter- nate fuels. 2.LEAD TIME- When considering the development of future)energy alternatives, the time required for developmentand construction (lead time) becomes significant.A few examples of lead times for energy related items are:Typical Energy Related Time FactorsBuilding specialized equipment (i.e., draglinefor strip mining)Construction of coal fired power plantsApproval, design and constructidn of a nuclear power plantDevelopment and Coimercialization of a new idea5-8 years4-5 years 15-20 years 10-20 years3.COSTS - When considering energy alternatives it is important1ZIffitermine whether these are efficient alternatives. Sources which are too expensive or difficult to use at the present time cannot 1e considereWuseable alternatives.4.ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT - It is important to realize that de- velopment of almost any energy source has some impact on the environment. 5.HUMAN IMPACT - It is important to consider how a particular decision will affect people. What groups of people might gain if a particular energy source is used? What groups might loose? ***You may think of other things to consider. Here is a form that will help you compare energy sources.Good Luck! 3740 COAL POWER INFORMATION SHEET To:Metro Power and Light CompanyFROM:Coal Research Team Coal is our most abundant fossil fuel. The known coal reserve inthe U.S. has been established and measured at 440 billion tons.Estirdates of \"ultimately recoverable\" coal exceed 1.1 trilliontons.At the current rate of use, these coal reserves can beexpected to list at least until the year 2300. However, newdemands will be placed on the coal industry and increased yearlydemands will, of course, reduce the lifetime of the nation'scoal supply.At least 100 years of expanding production willelapse, however, before ultimately recoverable coal depositshave to be tapped.Over 50 percent of the coal produced ftthe United States isused by electric utilities. The rest is used to produce steel,to fuel trains, to heat homes and commercial installations, andto export (only about 12 percent). The East is well-known forits large deposits of coal. Much larger coal reserves lie westof the Missippi River.Eastern coal tends to have a higher heat value, but western coalcontains much less sulfur which when burned creates the noxiouspollutant, sulfur dioxide (SO2). This and other of the sulfuroxides change to sulfur acid in contact with water. Thiscreates acid rain which threatens health and property. TheClean Air Act prohibits he production of more than 1.2 lbs. ofSO2 per million BTU of energy generated. Western coal releaseson the average 0.7 lbs. sulfur dioxide per million BTU. Easterncoal releases an average of 3 lbs. of it for each million BTU.To compensate for this environmental hazard, scrubbers are re-quired installations in utilities burning coal with a high sul-fur content.These scrubbers, which reduce the amount of SO2sent into the air, add to the cost of plant construction andthe cost per kwh of electricity produced.The scrubbers will not, however, reduce the amount of CO2 re-leased into the atmosphere as a product of burning coal. Coalburning adds more CO2 to the atmosphere per BTU prdduced thanany other fossil fuel. This may develop into a real drawbackas more understanding is gained about the \"greenhouse effect\"and the impact of CO2 on the global climate.Other disadvantages of coal burning include its formation ofnitrogen oxides (pollutants which are not currently controlled)and small particles of minerals, called \"particulates\", whichescape present controls. These particulates are often thenucleus around which sulfuric acid forms and the vehicle bywhich the acid is carried to earth. In addition, above-groundstrip mining, which produces about half the coal used, requiresthe disruption of large areas of land. N.Mining coal underground is very hazatdous, involving risks of mine collapse, toxic and explosive gas build-up, and black lung. At the same time, coal mining uses a lot of workers so the use of coal asa fuel provides more jobs per dollar than oil, nat- ural gas, or nuclear energy.Most electric utilities estimate a lead time of eight years or more to construct an 500 MW coal-fired plant.Such a plant cost $639/KW to build in 1978. Costs will probably increase in the futureas the costs of pollution control for coal-firedplants is added to construction costs. 3942 NUCLEAR POWER INFORMATION SHEETTo:Metro Power and. Light CompanyFrom:.Nuclear Power Research Team Conventional nuclear reactors release the energy of heavy nucleisuch as uranium by fissioning (splitting) them. In the processsome of their nuclear mass is converted into energy. In almostall U.S. reactors the primary fuel is the rare isotope of urani-um - U235.This element makes up less than 1 percent of alluranium ore.Fissioning one pound of enriched uranium (uraniumin which the concentration of U235 has been increased from itsnatural 0.71 percent to 3 or 4 percent) produces about 36 billionBTU (38 trillion joules) of energy. This is three million timesthe energy that can be produced from one pound of coal.In 1979, nuclear reactors accounted for almost 50,000 MW 6f gener-atint, capacity in the United States, and a total of 70,200 MWworldwide.The Department of Energy forecasts that the U.S.capacity could grow to 196,000 MW by 1995.The U.S. has an estimated 29 percent of the world's supply ofuranium reserves. These are resources that have been discoveredand measured.How long we will be able to draw on these reservesdepends on geology and economics. Higher prices will serve toopen up greater uranium supplies. But there will, of course, bean upper limit to the expansion of the reserves. Increases inprice cannot crate uranium. They can only serve to stimulateits discovery and recovery.The actual construction of a 500 MW nuclear power plant takesabout seven years. More time is required for obtaining permits,securing government clearance, and so on. Construction costsare high.A plant put into operation in 1978 cost about $913per kilowatt to build. New government regulations concerningsafety and the environment will probably greatly increase theconstruction costs of conventional reactors. Overall, utilitiesestimate that the costs for construction will continue to riseat the rate of 20 percent per year.Although nuclear plant construction is more expensive than theconstruction' of coal or oil-fired plants, the fuel costs fornuclear power plants are olower than coal and oil prices. In1978, a coal-fired generating plant cost about twice as muchto fuel as did a nuclear plant. Oil-fired plants cost evenmore.Utility owners expect the gap to widen, at least for thenext few years. The cost of electricity, however, depends onboth fuel and construction costs. 4340 Throughout the 70's controversy grew over the siting of nuclear plants and the wisdom of relying on nuclear energy. The possi- bility of a very damaging nuclear accident has created much opposition to nuclear power. This opposition has increased significantly since the Three Mile Island episode.Uncertain- ties about the future handling of nuclear wastes have added to the conflict.Nuclear supporters point to the plants' overlapping safety systems and claim that no fatalities have resulted from'accidents in com- merical nuclear plants. They cite the relatively small amount of air pollution produced by nuclear plants compared with coal or oil-fired power plants. And, since it takes a lot less uranium to get the same amount.of energy we get from coal, uranium strip mines will ultimately have a smaller impact on the land than will coal strip mines.

ECONOMICS IN THIS LESSON:Opportunity cost refers to what must be given up when decisionsare made to use scarce productive resources to produce particu-lar goods or services. A decision to produce one good meansgiving up the possibility of proeucing something else. Thus, the opportunity cost - what could have been produced with theresources instead - is the cost of producihg the good. For anindividual, the opportunity cost of something purchased is thenext best opportunity that must be foregbne. For a society,it is the next best'Slternate use to which productive resources could havee been put. RATIONALE:When decisions are made to use scarce resources to produce energy,opportunity costs are involved. Another use of these resourcesis foreclosed. Citizens must be sure that energy decisions are.based on a clear understanding of the opportunity costs involved.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to:1.Define opportunity costs;2.Identify the opportunity costs involved indecisions involving the use of scarce resources.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE:A.Have students read paragraph 1 in the studentmaterials. B.Ask students why they think \"time\" is considereda scarce resource in paragraph 1. They might re-spond \"because there are only a limited numberof hours in a day but there are numerous wayspeople want and are able to use that time.\" 4547 C.Have students read paragraph 2. Review its mean-ing as a group. Ask them. who must make a decisionabout the use of time. (Answer: Me, a basketballplayer.) Ask them what the alternatives are.(Answer: Practice basketball or work at the grocerystore.) Here is a situation where a choice must bemade about the use of a scarce resource, time. D.You might ask students to describe situations inwhich they have been faced with choosing betweenalternative ways of using scarce resources such 36time or income. NOTE:Record student examplesfor later use. E.Have students read paragraphs 3-5. As a class,review the characteristics of opportunity cost: 1..not measured in money;2.refers to the next best use of a resourcethat is foregone when a decision is madeto use that resource in a particular way.F.Review the examples of opportunity costs in para-graphs 4 and 5. It is important for students torealize that opportunity costs are the next bestopportunities passed by or foreclosed.G.Have students follow the directions contained inparagraph 6.They should respond:a) The girl's time is limited. She must choosehow to use it. The opportunity cost of herdecision to go with one boy is not being ableto go to the dance with the other boy.b) The lot is the scarce resource. The opportunitycost of using the lot for a park is not beingable to use it for a parking lot.c) Steel is the limited resource here. The oppor-tunity cost of building the bridge is not beingable to build the hospital.H.Return to the student descriptions of decision makingsituations generated in response to Step D, above.Have students apply the questions asked in paragraph6 of the student materials to their examples. I.In paragraph 7 of the student materials attentionfocuses on energy. Have students follow the directionscontained in paragraph 7. (If your students have com- pleted the lesson \"What Is Needed To Produce Energy?\" 4846tat ask them to identify which resources in the storiesare natural resources, capital goods and labor.)They should raspond:a) natural gas; to heat homes or to make fertilizer;not being able to use that natural gas for ferti-lizer.(Natural gas is a natural resource.)b) crude oil; to make gasoline or to make plastics;ita--5el-Ei able to use that crude oil to make plastics.(Crude oil isa natural resource.)c) concrete; to make buildings for a nuclear powerplant or to build dams; not being able to usethat concrete to build dams. (Concrete is a capital good.)d) land; for a windmill or a radio antenna; not beingable to build a radio antenna there. (Land is a natural resource.)e) the skilled workers; to find and produce more energyor to createadEiT.goods; not using the workers tocreate other goods. (Skilled workers are an example of laborpNOTE TO TEACHER: Students might argue that there ismore aim one alternate way to use each of the resourcesdescribed,in the stories. You should point out thatopportunity costs refer to the next best use to whicha resource can be put.End the lesson by pointing out that students and theirfamilies must recognize the opportunity costs involvedin the decisions they make as energy consumers. Forexample: What next best use of a family's limitedincome is given up when a large portion of that in-come is spent on gasoline to keep the family stationwagon going ?.(This is a topic considered in detailin another lesson. But it is an important point tomake now.)Point out also that as citizens students have a 're-sponsibility to oversee how energy decisions aremade in their communities and nation. One importantaspect ,of that monitoring involves.,watching the extentto which opportunity costs have been considered inenergy decision making.SUGGESTED VALUATION STRATEGY: 1.Ask students to define opportunity costs. Have them givean example from their own experience. 4749 2.Develop .a series.of short stories similar to those con-tained in. paragraph 7 of the student materialg% Use thequestions in paragraph 7 to test students' ability toidentify the opportunity costs involved in decisions in-volving the use of scarce resources to produce energy.SPIN OFFThe worksheet entitled, \"Other Uses for Resources That CouldBe Used To Get Energy\" will give students additional practicein identifying opportunity costs involved in energy production. The worksheet contains a list of resources. Beside eachresource is an example of how it can be used to produce energy.The students' task is to suggest the next best use for thatresource. Let students use their imagination. Accept allreasonable answers. 5010t 48 STUDENT MATERIALS: OPPORTUNITY COSTS 1.All decisions involving the use of scarce resources forceus to choose between alternatives. For most of us time isa good example of a scarce resource. We always have somuch to do, but a limited amount of time to do it in. Wemust make choices about the use of our limited time. 2.Imagine that you are on your school's basketball team.After school each day you have two hours available beforesupper and homework. Now will you use these two hours?You could go to basketball practice. The coach has arule that players must attend all practices if they wantto play in the weekend game against the other schools.'You could spend that time working at the grocery store.You want to earn money to buy your mother a birthdaypresent.These are your alternatives. 3.Decisions have opportunqy costs associated with them.Opportunity costs are not measured in dollars. They re-fer to the next best use of a resource that is passed upor foregone when a decision is made to use that resourcein a particular way. 4.If you spend your time practicing basketball then you willpass up a chance to earn money for a present. Not beingable to earn money to buy your mother a birthday presentis the opportunity cost involved in deciding to spend yourtime at basketball practice. 5.What if you decided to spend your time working at thegrocery store? What would your opportunity costs be then?It would be not going to practice and therefore not play-ing games against other schools. 6.All decisions made about the use of a scarce resource in4involve opportunity costs. Below are three stories. Ineach case, identify the resource about which a decisionis being made. Then describe the opportunity cost involvedin the decision.a)A girl has two different boys ask her to the sameschool dance. What is the opportunity cost of herdecision to go with one boy?b)A city has a vacant lot that it can use for a citypark or as a central parking lot. What is the oppor-tunity cost involved in building the park?c)A small country is able to purchase enough steel tobuild a bridge or a hospital. What is the opportu-nity cost of building the bridge? 5149 7.Scarce resources are used to produce energy. Using theOeresources to produce energy means thatOey.cannpt beused to produce something else. What opportunity cost6are involved in energy production? The following storieswill help answer that question. For each story:i) identify the scarce resource about which a decisionis being made.ii) identify the alternate use to which the resource can be put.iii) describe the opportunity cost involved in the decision.a)A million cubic feet of natural gas can be used to heathomes.It can also be converted into fertilizer togrow food.What is the opportunity cost involved inusing the natural gas to heat homes?b)A million barrels of crude oil can be used to make gaso-line for cars. It can also be made into plastics. What is the opportunity cost involved musing the crude oilto make gasoline?c)A certain amount of concrete can be used to make thecontainment building of a nuclear power plant. It can also be used to build hydroelectric dams. Whatis the opportunity cost involved in using the concrete?8.Energy production requires that decisions be made aboutthe use of scarce resources. These decisions will involveopportunity costs. The next best use of these resources will be given up or foregone when they are used to pro- duce energy. It is our responsibility as citizens to besure that energy decisions are 'based on a clear under-standing of the opportunity costs involved.

ECONOMICS 1N THIS LESSON:Opportunity costs refer to what must be given up when decisionsare made to use scarce productive resources to produce particu-lar goods and services. A decision to produce one good meansgiving up the possibility of producing something else. Thus,the opportunity cost - what could have been produced with theresources instead - is the cost of producing that good. Foran individual the opportunity cost of something purchased istie other things that must be foregone. For a society, it is alternate uses to ;NCI productive resources could havebeen put.When a person or a group chooses from among alternatives thisinvolves comparing the various costs (including opportunity costs)and benefits of each of the alternatives.RATIONALE:In deciding whether or not to undertake measures to reduce energyuse it is necessary to balance the costs of a particular measureagainst its expected benefits. Most people are aware of the bene-fits associated with energy use reduction measures.But do theyrealize that there are opportunity costs as well as monetarycosts involved in implementing those measures? The purpose ofthis lesson is to examine the opportunity costs associated withdecisions to reduce energy use.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1.Define opportunity costs;2.Describe opportunity costs involved in decisionsrelated energy use.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE: A.Begin by saying: \"For most of us, time is a goodexample of a limited resource. We always have somuch we want to do, but a limited amount of timeto do it in.We must make choices about the useof our limited time, and other limited resources.\" 5354 1. B.Go on, \"Imagine that tonight you will have one houravailable between supper and bed time. How will youuse that time? You could watch T.V. Your favoriteshow is on tonight. You could spend the time finish-ing a book report. It's due the day after tomorrow.These are your choices. C.Diagram the situation c scribed.in Step B on the chalk-board, as follows: One Hourtime, a limited resource choices ---- Watch T.V. Finish a BookReport D.Then say \"Decisions have costs that go along with themthat are not measured in dollars. These kinds of costsrefer to the next best opportunity that is passed upwhen one choice is taken instead of another. Thesecosts ace called opportunity costs. E.\"Let's say you choose to watch your favorite program..What is the opportunity cost of making that choice?You pass up an opportunity to finish your book reportSo the opportunity cost of watching T.V. tonight isnot finishing your book report. F.Ask \"What is the' opportunity cost involved in choos-ing to finish your book report?\" Students should re-spond, \"Well, I give up the opportunity to watch my favorite T.V. program. So the opportunity cost offinishing my report is not being able to watch T.V.\"G.Distribute the student handout \"Opportunity Costs\".Have students read the directions for Part A. Re- view the directions as a group. Then have students complete Part A. H.Review student answers to the questions posed in PartA of the handout. They should'respond: 5J54 Situation Ont: Mark's time re-source.ii) Student's choiceiii)If student picks baby sitting-then the opportunity cost isnot being able to go out withfriends. If student picksgoing out with friends, thenthe opportunity cost notbaby sitting.i) Tina's paycheck is the limitedresourceii) Student's choiceiii) If student picks new record al-bum, then the opportunity costis not being able to buy a newshirt.If student picks newshirt,-the opportunity cost isnot being able to bu,a newrecord album.NOTE:Point out that in thit case a money cost - the price of the shirt or record as well as an opportunity cost was involved.Situation Three: i) Bill's supply of hardwood is choice.iii) If student picks building a desk,then the opportunity cost is nothaving any wood to build a table.If the student picks building atable, then the opportunity costis not having any wood to builda desk. I.Complete this portion of the lesson by reviewing themeaning of opportunity costs as follows: (You maywant to write these points on the chalkboard.)i)We must make choices about the use of ourlimited resources.ii)When one thing is chosen over another there issometimes a money cost involved.iii)Tho.re is always an opportunity cost involved.iv)An opportunity cost is not measured in dollarsand cents.v)It is the next best opportunity that is givenup when one thing is chosen instead of another.J.To begin the second part of the lesson say - \"Consumersare often faced with making choices. Some of thesechoices have to do with energy. Here's an example: \"Let's suppose that the price of electricity increases.if this happens, most consumers will try to reduce orcut down on the amount of electricity they use.\" Thenask \"How can a consumer cut down on the amount of elec-tricity she uses in her home?\" Record studeat responseson They might respond: out certain electric appliances less (e.g.,fewer hours of T.V., etc.)oif she has an electric furnace, she could turn thethermostat downoshe could insulate her electric water heateroshe could use some appliances differently (e.g.,open dishwasher door to dry dishes).Some students might mention that she could turn toa substitute. If she heated her home with electricity,she might replace her electric furnace with one thatuses natural gas. K.,'\"So there are a lot of ways to reduce the amount ofelectricity used in the home. But before any of theseways are used some choices must be made, like: oShould we start turning off the lights all thetime or should we go on as we are?oShould we buy an \"old fashioned\" hand operatedcan opener or keep using our electric one?\"Let's imagine that a consumer is faced with making oneof these kinds of choices: She examines the family bud-get very carefully and finds 500 dollars that could beused to buy one ,of those'new energy-efficient refrige-rators that uses only a little electricity to operate.She figures that electricity prices will keep goingup so by spending some money now for an energyefficient refrigerator, the family will save a lotof money in the future on the electric bills.Then she starts wondering \"Do I go down to the appli-ance store and buy a new refrigerator or shouldspend $500 to get my teeth fixed? These cavitiesare killing me!\"Let's say she decides to go ahead and buy the energyefficient refrigerator. What are her money costs?(Students response - $500). What is her opportunitycost? (She gives up an opportunity to get her teethfixed.- So the opportunity cost of buying the refrig-erator is not getting her teeth fixed.) L.Have students read the directions for Part B of the handout \"Opportunity Costs.\" Review the directions as a group. Then have students complete Part B. Encourage them to use their imaginations.M.Review studentresponses to the questions asked inPart B as a class. Many answers are possible. Be sure, however, that they represent opportunitiesforeclosed by the decision made in each case. Some . possibilities:a)giving up comfort of cool temperatures in your house.b)giving up the opportunity to move around the city on your own schedule. What could you do with the time spent waiting?c)other thingsyou could have done with yourtime and money.d)giving up your old friends and familiar neighbor- hood.e).giving up spare time that you spent to buy and operate a large refrigerator needed to store all that perishable food.NOTE TO TEACHER: Students might argue that there is more man one7rnernate way of using each of the limited re- sources described in these situations. You should point out that opportunity costs refer to the next best use to which the resource can be put.N.To end this lesson, remind students that when con-sumers make decisions they must consider the costsas well as the benefits that go along with thosedecisions. Point out in closing that when costs are estimated, money costs are often important. But opportunity costs - the next best opportunity that must be given up when a particular decision is made - must always be considered.SUGGESTED EVALUATION STRATEGY: 1.Ask students to define opportunity costs. Have them give an example from their own experience. 2.Develop a series of short energy saving decision statements similar to those contained in Part B of the student work- sheet. Have students describe an opportunity cost associated with each decision. Here are some possible statements:a)deciding to reduce the amount of natural gas used by turning down the thermostat in your home.b)deciding to reduce the amount of gasoline used by getting your car tuned. 575E1 SPIN OFFIn this lesson, students have examined opportunity costs involvedin reducing energy use. They should now realize that no way ofsaving energy is without its costs.This lesson can be extended by having students examine the costsand benefits associated with several proposals aimed at reducingenergy consumption. You could proceed as follows: A.Divide the class into groups. B.Assign one of the following proposals to each group (you'.might want to assign the same proposal to more than onvgroup).Point out that each proposal is aimed at reducingenergy consumption. 1.Require all schools to have a three-month winterbreak instead of a three-month summer break to savefuel. 2.\u00b0Increase the age at which a person can get a driver'slicense to 20. 3.Ban the use of recreational vehicles such as campers,minibikes, snowmobiles, and pleasure motorboats. 4.Ban all students from driving to school if bustransportation is available. 5.Ban the use of all non-essential household appli-ances such as electric garagefdoor openers, elec-tric can openers, color T.V.,Ys, electric tooth-brushes, stereo system,, and hair dryers. C.Ask each group to prepare answers to the following questionsand be prepared to present them to the rest of the class. 1.What might be some of the economic costs and benefitsof the proposal? 2.What groups.of people might gain if might lose? 3.Is the proposal practica]? 4.What would be your personal costs and benefits, as high school students, if the proposal were adapted? D.Have someone from each group present the group's answers.Allow other students to comment on what is said and to raisequestions about the presentations. STUDENT HANDOUT OPPORTUNITY COSTSShown -below are choices faced by different people.In each case, (i) identify the limited resource described, (ii) identify the choice that you would pick and (iii)state the opportunity cost involved in making thatchoice.Use the space provided for your answers.Situation One: Mark can baby sit on Saturday night orgo out with friends.i)what limited resource is described here?ii)which choice would you pick?iii)what is the opportunity cost involved in making that choice? Situation Two: Tina can spend part of her paycheck tobuy a new record album or a new shirt.i)what limited resource is described here?ii)which choice would you pick?iii)what is the opportunity cost involved in makingthat choice? Situation Three: Bill has been able to purchase asupply of hard wood. He can use it tobuild a desk for himself or a table forfor his mother's birthday.i)what limited resource is describe here?ii)w isc is makingthat choice? Part B:Listed below a1,1 5 decisions that you could make to re- duce energy use. There are benefits (in terms of poss- ible future savings) that go along with each. Somedecisions have money costs that go along with them.Your job, however, is to consider only opportunitycosts.Write down, in the space provided, an oppor-IiiiiITY cost that would go along with each of thesedecisions.Many different answers arc possible. 6059 a.saving energy by turning up the thermostat on your air conditioner.b.decidinto reduce the amount of gasoline us14id----by takinthe bus.c.decidingo reduce the amount of 'heating oil usedby spending the weekend caulking and weatherstripping your home. , ,d.deciding to reduce the amount of gasoline usedby, moving to a home nearer the place where you work.e.saving gasoline 'by doang all your grocery shop- ping in one weekly trip. LESSON 7: SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND PRICES IN THE ENERGY MARKET CONCEPTS:Market, supply, demand, market clearing priceRECOMMENDED USE: High \"Scenes at a Hoosierland GasolineStation\"Blackline masters of these worksheets are included. ECONOMICS IN THIS LESSON: bIn the American economy individual buyers and sellers register their decisions to buy or sell goods, services and productiveresources in the market. The market \"adds up\" these individual decisions to buy and sell and creates dut of them aggreghte forees known as supply and demand.Supply and demand constitute the sum total of all the indivi- dual decisions to sell and to buy in the market.Interacting with one another the price of what is bought and sold is deter- mined.Supply indicates the amounts of anything that will be offered or sale at various possible prices during some period of time,other things constant. Generally the higher the price of some- thing4 the more it will be produced and offered cor sale- and vice-versa.Demand ieflects the amount that consumers will be willing and able to buy at various possible prices during the same timeperiod, other things constant. Typically, the lower the price, the more will be demanded and vice-versa.In the market, supply and demand working together determine a market clearing rice.At this price the amount demanded andthe amount supplied are equal. RATIONALE:The concepts of supply, demand and market clearing price are useful when analyzing the economic actions involved in energyuse. Unfortunately, these concepts are often :used in a con- fusing manner by writers and speakers. It As therefore im- portant that students learn the correct definitions of theseconcepts and their accurate application to energy use.Clari- fying these terms and using them correctly is the purpose of this lesson. 6162 INSTRUCTIONALOBJECTIVES/On completion of this lesson, learnerswill be able to: 1.Define supply, demand and market clearing price;2.Describe the relation between prices and thequantities supplied and demanded;3.Describe how price changes affect the decisionsmade by producers and consumers.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE:NOTE: An effort is made in this lesson to make an abstract setorideas- the working of a market economy - concreted for students.Thus, a survey like the one described in the lesson is not reallyheld to determine level of supply and demand. Estimates are madeas if a survey of individual consumers and producers was heldand their responses were added together, however.One of your tasks in this lesson will be to periodically remindstudents that they will get a good sense of how the \"real world\"works in terms of supply and demand by working with the imaginarymaterials in this lesson. Several suggestions for connectingthe lesson with real work events are made in this teacher'sguide.A.You may decide to present the materials contained inparagraphs 1-3 (including Table One) to the studentsorally.It is important for students to realize ,that consumers were asked how much gasoline they '4.would be willing and able to purchase on the dayof the survey and that individual answers wereadded together to produce the demand figures seenin Table One.NOTE: In reality, of course, demand ip never asaccurately computed as it is here. It, neverthe-less, represents the sum of individual consumers'decisions.In.the same way supply representsthe sum of individual producers' decisions.B.Have students read paragraph 4 and review thecharacteristics of demand as a group:The amount of a product consumers are willingand able to purchase at various possible pricesduring a period of time. C.NOTE: Certain factors determine the amount of a product, like gasoline, that consumers are will- ing and able to purchase at various prices.These factors called, determinants of demand,like consumer income aialIiifi7WEW7ia3ia tochange.When they change - the amounts demandedat various prices will also change. In thislesson a specific data is always used when discussing demand. This has the effect ofholding these determinants of demand constant (they probably won't change in one day). Thisallows students to observe the effects ofchanges in price on the amount demanded, with-out worrying about \"other things constant\".(The lesson \"Changes in Supply and Demand\"examines the of demand andsupply),Hand out the worksheet \"Supply and Demand.\"Have students follow the directions in para-graph 5.Their graph should look like this:FIGURE A: DEMAND FOR GASOLINE, HOOSIERLANDApril 1, 19782.001.751.501.25Price1.00.75..50.250MEI(Tens of Thousands510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 of Gallons)E.After students have completed their demand linegraphs, have them answer the question in para-graph 6.They should respond \"C\" - The amountof gasoline demanded decreases as the priceincreases.\" F.To complete this section of the lesson, pointout that what is true of Hoosierland is trueelsewhere - certainly in this country. It isalso true for most products. Consumers willbuy less of a product at a higher price thanthey will at a lower price, other things con-stant. G.The next section of the lesson deals with supply.It is covered in paragraphs 8 to 13 of the stu-dent materials. Use the procedure suggested inSteps A-F above to cover.this ma erial. Stu-dents are asked to construct a li e graph inparagraph 11.They use the works et \"Supplyand Demand.\" Their graphs should ook like this: 6364 FIGURE B:SUPPLY OF GASOLINE, HOOSIERLAND, Aril 1 1978 2.001.751.501.25Price1.00.75.50.250 (Tens off Thousands 5400 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 78 80 of Gallons)Their answer to the question in paragraph 12should be \"A\" - \"As price increases, the amountof gasoline supplied also increases.\"H.NOTE: Certain factors determine the amountof aproduct, like gasoline, that suppliers -are will-ing and able to offer for sale, at various prices.These factors, called determinants o supply -like the price of 'resources and the,number ofproducers - are subject to change./In thislesson a specific date is always /used whendiscussing supply. This has the effect ofholding these determinants of supply con-stant.This allows students to observe theeffects of change in price on the amountsupplied without worrying about \"other thingsconstant.\" (The lesson \"Changes in Supply andDemand\" examines the determinants of supplyand demand). I.Conclude the section on supply by pointingout that what is true of Hoosierland is alsotrue elsewhere, like in the U.S. It is alsotrue for most products. Producers will pro-vide more of a product for sa_e at a higherprice than they will at a lower price, otherthings constant. J.Paragraph 14 reviews what students have learnedabout the needs of Hoosierland consumers andproducers.Basically their needs oppose eachother. 65 rt,64 You might point out that what is true of Hoosier-land is true of the U.S. and what is true of gaso-line is true of almost all products. Producersarwilling and able to offer more at high prices.Coumers are willing and able to purchase moreat low prices. K.Thepoint out that in the U.S., a! well as inHoo ierland, questions such as what price ischaed, how much is produced, how much is pur-ha ed and who gets what is produced are answereda market situation. (Paragraphs 15 and 16). L.H ve students read paragraphs 17 and 18. Pointo t that, the graph in Figure C shows the marketituation for gasoline in Hoosierland for onePatent in time. In the graph the demands ofthe consumers are allowed to interact with thesupplies offered by the producers.NOTE:A similar graph could be used to show theinteraction of supply and demand for nearly any .product available in the U.S. M.Have students read paragraphs 19-21. Review theseparagraphs as a class.a) There is one price - $1.25 - whereithe supplyand demand lines intersect and the quantitydemanded equals the quantity supplied.b) This price is called the market clearing pricebecause...c) all gasoline offered for sale at that pricewould be purchased.NOTE:Some students may have trouble understandingwhey- 35,000 gallons would be both demanded and sup-plied at $1.25. If they do, have them look back tofigures 4 and 10 to examine supply and demand separ-ately at the $1.25 price. N.Point out that under normal conditions the price ofproducts tends to move toward the market clearingprice.(NOTE: One exception in the U.S. economyoccurs when the government imposes a price controlbelow the market clearing price. This topic isexamined in the lesson \"Price Ceilings.\") O.Once the price of a product is established in amarket situation the amount of the product thatwill be produced and purchased is also established(paragraph 22). P.A hew idea is introduced in paragraph 23 - pricehas a rationing effect. It determines who willpurOrasea produce.Have students readifiisparagraph carefully. Be sure they understandthat price plays a rationing role.Q.With the information contained in paragraph 23 asbackground, have students follow the directions incparagraph 24. Accept all reasonable suggestions.You might want to distinguish between short range(SR) options- things that people can do immediately;and long range (LR) options that they can imple- /ment over .a longer period of time. Students mightrespond:a)The consumer could' do without gasoline. (SR)b)The consumer could use. a lost less gasolinebysusing his/her car less. (SR)c)The consumer might start walking or takingthe bus. (SR)d)Piirehase a fuel efficient car. (LR)e)Move closer to job, schools, shopping. (LR)f)Political action to increase/improve publictransportation. (LR) SUGGESTED EVALUATION STRATEGY: 1.Ask students to define supply, demand and market clearing price. 2.Provide students with information about various energy pro-ducts similar to that contained in Tables One and Two.Then have them: a)construct line graphs;b)state in words the trends shown in the line graphs.Here is some information that you can use: Amount Demanded 100,000 kilowatt hrs90,000 2C 45,00070,000 70,00050,000 4C 80,00045,000 5 95,000'DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY Price (Per Kilowatt hrs) Amount Supplied 30,000 kilowatt hrs. 6766 003.Use the information in the Table above to create a marketsituation graph (like Figure C) then:a) have stlid2nts identify the market clearing priceb) answer questions about the options available toconsumers and producers when the price of elec-tricity changes. ,SPIN OFFIn this lessonttudentshave been introduced to the concepts of supply and demand as they interact in the market. They havelearned where orices come from and that they usually stabilizenear the marke clearing price. To extend thi;s lesson have themrespond to the questions on the worksheet \"Scenes at a Hoosier-land Gasoline Station.\"NOTE:The first situation describes a surplus.You should pointout that a sale at a clothing store, an &fter Christmas sale, aWashington's Birthday sale, etc., are all.similar to the way gaso-line producers dealt with the surplus (as shown in the picture ofprices being lowered). Each of these techniques is used by sellersto find a price where all of their merchandise will be sold tocustomers. A clearance sale is an attempt to clear the market,The second situation describes a shortage. In this situationthe prices would be going up encouraging sellers to sell moreand consumers to buy less. e)- STUDENT MATERIALS: SUPPLY, DEMAND AND PRICES IN THE ENERGY MARKETDEMAND FOR GASOLINE 1.Imagine that a nationwide energy survey was held in thefictional country of Hoosierland, about 5 years ago. Inthe survey energy consumers were shown a chart of differ-ent: gasoline prices. The chart looked like this:PRICE PER GALLON$2.001.501.251.00.50 2.Then the consumers were asked \"How much gasoline wouldyou consume at each of the prices shown on the chart?\"The consumers were asked not to answer in terms ofhow much gasoline they desired. They were cautionedto,tell how much they were willing and able to buy onthe day of the survey, Aprirl, 1.The Answers provided by all consumers involved in thesurvey were added together. The results are shOwn inTable One.TABLE demand for gasoline in Hoosierland on the day of the survey. Demand refers to the amount of aproduct that people are willing and able to purchase at various prices at a certartiiime. The fable says that if gasoline was offered for sale at $2.00 a gallon, the amount demanded would be 20,000 gallons. If the price was $1.00,the amount demanded would be 40,000 gallons.Amount Demanded (in gallons) 6968 5.In Figure A on the worksheet \"Supply and Demand\", gallonsof gasoline are shown along the horizontal axis. Price isshown along the vertical axis. Use the information inTable One to construct a line graph on the worksheet. 6.Which one of the following conclusions can be drawn fromthe demand line that you constructed?a)Theamountof gasoline demanded does not seem tobe affected by price.b)As price increases the amount of gasoline demandedalso increases.c)The amount of gasoline demanded decreases as theprice increases. 7.The conclusions drawn for Hoosierland are true in othercountries, like the United States. Consumers will buyless of a product at a higher price than they will ata lower price other things constant.SUPPLY OF GASOLINE 8.In the survey of April 1, 1978 Hoosierland gasoline pro-ducers were also asked a question. They were shown thesame price chart and asked \"How much gasoline would youoffer for sale at each of the prices shown on the chart?\"The produce,rs were asked not to answer in terms of howmuch gasoline they'd like to sell. They were cautionedto tell how much they were willing and able to offer forsale, on the the day of the survey. 9.The answers provided by all producers involved in thesurvey were added together. The results are shown inTable Two.TABLE TWO:SUPPLY OF GASOLINE, HOOSIERLAND supply of gasoline in Hoosierland onthe day of the survey. Sualy refers to the amount of apro uct that producers are willing and able to offer forale at various prices, at a certain time. The tableIsays that if gasoline could be offered for sale at $2.00a gallon, the amount supplied would be 60,000gallons.If the price was $1.00, the amount supplied would be30,000 gallons.11.In Figure B on the worksheet \"Supply and Demand,\" gallonsof gasoline are shown along the horizontal axis. Priceis shown along the vertical axis. Use the informationin Table Two to construct a line graph on the worksheet.12.Which one of the following conclusions can be drawn fromthe supply line,graph you constructed? a)As price increases the amount of gasoline suppliedalso increases.b)The amount of gasoline supplied does not seem tobe affected by price.c)The amount of gasoline supplied descreases as theprice increases.13.The conclusion drawn for Hoosierland is true in othercountries, like the United States. Producers will pro-vide more of a product for sale at a higher price thanthey will at a lower price, other things constant.THE ENERGY MARKET14.Decisions made by consumers and producers in Hoosierlandare affected by the same factors. These are ability,willingness, and price. But these factors affect thedecisions of consumers and producers in the oppositeway!Producers are willing and able to offer moregasolin; for sale at high prices. Consumers are will-ing and able to purchase less gasoline at high prices.ConSumers are willing and able to purchase more at lowprices.Producers are willing and able to offer lessfor sale at low prices. 15.How can such a situation work out to satisfy anyone?At what price is anything bought and sold? How much of anything will be bought and sold? Who gets what is bought and sold? 16.The answer is that Hoosierland producers and consumers must make their needs known to each other. This is done in a market situation. 17.The market situation for gasoline in Hoosierland can h7 seen on the following graph. It was made by putting thedemand line graph and the supply line graph that you con- structed together. 7170 3.002.752.502.252.001.75Price 1.501.251.00.75.50.250FIGURE C:MARKET SITUATION, HOOSIERLANDApril 1, 1978 \"-.Supplyr \"14-- Demand (Tens of Thousands 510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70. 75 80of Gallons) 18.The graph in Figure C shows the amount of gasoline that con-'sumers in Hoosierland are willing and able to purchase atvarious prices on April 1, 1978. It also shows the amount of gasoline that Hoosierland producers were willing and able to offer for sale at various prices on that date.19.At what price will gasoline be bought and sold in the situa- tion shown on the graph? You will notice that there is one point at which the demand line and the supply line intersect. It is at $1.25 a gallon.20.If the price of gasoline is $1.25 a gallon - 35,000 gallons will be demanded. An equal amount will be supplied. At that price producers are willing and able to offer for sale the same amount of gasoline as consumers are willing and able to purchase.21.$1.25 is the market clearing price, in this situation.All gasoline offered for sale would be purchased at that price.22.Price determines'howmuch producers are willing and able to offer for sale. It also determines how much consumers are willing and able to purchase. 7172 23.The market clearing price also determines who will purchasethe product.If gasoline, for example, is sold at $1.25'a gallon in Hoosierland 35,000 gallons will be purchased.But it will be purchased only by those consumers who arewilling and able to spend $1.25 for a gallon of gas. Ifthe market clearing price increases to $1.50 some consumerswill not purchase gasoline, others will buy less.24.To end this lesson list three options that are availableto a Hoosierland consumer who is unwilling and/or unableto purchase at the market clearing price ($1.25). 7372 3.002.752,502.252.001.75PriCe1.501.251..00.75.50.250 3.002.752.502.252.001.75Price1.501.25.1.00.75.50.25.0ySUPPLY AND DEMANDFIGURE A:DEMAND FOR 1978 AP, an- 11, 1WORKSHEET ens of510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80(Tof Gallons)Thousands FIGURE B:SUPPLY OF II(Tens of510 15 2025 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80ofGallions) 7374 2.252.001.751.50Price1.251.00.75.50.250SCENES.

The result is a change inthe market clearing price for that product. One such event was the decision of OPEC nations to restrict theexports of oil to their customers. This lesson examines an eventlike the OPEC decision, among others, within a supply-demand.context.The lesson shows how such events cause changes insupply and result in higher or lower market prices.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson. learners will be 1.Define \"ch4ge in supply\" and \"change in demand\".2.Explain why changes occur in supply and demand.3.Describe how price changes,, resulting from changesin supply affect decisions made by producers andconsumers.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDU A.If your stude is ave not covered the other lessonsin this unit deal rig with supply and demand, havestudents rev ew aterials.Otherwise, paragraphs1-7 can serves a review of the basics of supply,demand, and market cleATing price. B.Have students read paragr hs 8-10 of the studentmaterials.NOTE: At this vel it is not importantfor students to be able to list the determinantsof demand or be able to identify these determinants.What is important is that they1) understand that certain factors determine theamount of a good demanded at various prices;(paragraph 8)2) that the demand line on a graph or demand in-formation in a table reflects the status ofthese determinants at one point in time. This point in time is always identified on the tableor graph; (paragraph 9)3) these determinants may change at any time..Thiswill cause the amount demanded at various pricesto change. (paragraph 10). C.Have students follow the directions in paragraph 11.Their graph should look like this: 78\\,78, 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 iX 100 (Tens of Thousandsof Gallons)Point out that the demand line has shifted totheright.Gasoline is a good that people want'moreof as income increases.

You might intro- duce the final section of this lesson by pointing out that what is described here is a situation similar to the conditions faced by the U.S. in 1973 and 1979 when OPEC drastically reduced.exports. You might also men tion that the situation described in paragraph 22, an agreement amoug independent suppliers to coordin-ate their supply decisions, is called a cartel.The term cartel is often used to describe the suppliersthemselves - as in \"OPEC is a cartel\" as well as the agreement among them.M.Have students follow the directions in paragraph 25.

Ask students to explain why theshift occurred. (Expect general answers only). 3.Show students graphs containing information like thatthey developed in response to the directions in para-graph 25. Then ask a series of questions similar tothose in paragraph 26.SPIN OFFStudents might be interested in exploring what hashappened since OPEC reduced exports in 1979 with theconsequent increase in prices - as described in thefinal section of this lesson. Since 1982 news maga-zines have featured this issue. Have students begin with the situation described inthis lesson - higher oil prices --- change in supply--- higher market clearing pricstrlor gasoline. Thenhave them trace what has happened since to suppliesand prices using information contained in news maga-zine articles.Have them pay special attention to thegroups, of people who gain from a specific price changeand those who lose. They may be surprised!

(A)Amount Supplied(in 1.50 35,000 1.25 30,000 1.0020,000 .50(C)Amount Demanded(in gallons) 20,000 30,000 35,000 40,000 50,000 2.Column \"C\" shows the demand for gasoline in Hoosierland onApril 1, 1978.DemanaiiTirs to the amount of a productthat people are willing and able to purchase at variousprices.Column \"A\" shows the supply of gasoline in Hoosier-land on April 1, 1978. Supply refers to the amount of aproduct that producers are willing and able to offer forsale at various prices. 3.The table says that if gasoline cnuld be offered for saleat $2.00 a gallon, 60,000 gallons would be supplied. Atthat price, 20,000 gallons would be demanded. How muchgasoline would be demanded if the price was $1.00 pergallon?How much would be supplied at that price? 4.The information in Table One is shown in graphic form inFigure A. 8383 FIGUREPrice3.002.752.502.252.001.751.501.251.00.75.50.250A:DEMAND FOR GASOLINE, HOOSIERLAND, APRIL 11 1978 Supply Demand 510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 (Tens of Thousandsof Gallon,* Gallons of Gasoline 5.At what price will gasoline be bought and sold in thesituation shown on the graph? You will notice thatthere is one point at which the demand line and thesupply line intersect. It is at $1.25 a gallon. 6.If the price of gasoline is $1.25 a gallon - 35,000gallons will be demanded and supplied. At that priceproducers are willing and able to offer for sale thesame amount of gasoline as consumers are willing andable to purchase. 7.One dollar and twenty-five cents ($1.25) is the marketclearing price. All gasoline offered for sale would bepurchased at that price. Usually, a product's price wi.11move toward the market clearing price.CHANGES IN DEMAND 8.Cei-tain factors determine the amount of a product that con-sumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices.These determinants of demand are: i)the price of other products;ii)consumer income;iii) consumer tastes;iv)consumer hopes for the future;v)lumber of consumers. 884 9.So, the amount of gasoline demanded at various prices in Hoosierland on April 1, 1978 (seen in Table One and Figure A) was affected by many things.One was the price being charged for other products - like food and clothing. The amount demanded at various prices was also affected by Hoosierlanders' incomes. Finally, tastes, hopes for the future and the number of consumers in Hoosierland affected the amount of gasoline demanded at various prices on that day10.If any of these determinants change, the information in Table One, Column \"C\" would change. Imagine, for example, that Hoosierlanders' incomes went up in 1979.What would happen?Well, when people have more money to spend they usually buy more gasoline. This is true for cheap gas, middle pricelgas, and expensive gas.In 1979, Hoosierlanders had more money to spend so they probably bought more gaso- line than in 1978. Table Two shows the results.TABLE TWO:DEMAND FOR GASOLINE HOOSIERLAND Price (per gallon) Amount Demanded (in gallons)$2.00 30,000 1.50 40,000 1.25 45,0001.00 50,000.50 60,00011.Use the information in Table Two to construct a demand lineon Figure B below for January 20, 1979.FIGUREB:Price 3.002.752.502.252.001.751.501.251.00.75.50.250DEMAND FOR GASOLINE, HOOSIERLAND, January 20, 1979Vie or- Supply Demand,..../ 510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80Gallons of Gasoline 8585 12.Notice the position of the demand line. It shifted to theright (increased) when income level increased. Gasoline isthe kind of good that people buy more of when incomes in-crease. 13.Imagine that in the summer of 1979 tastes of. Hoosierlandersbegan to change. Instead of using theiicars to travel every-where, they started walking and using bikes. As a result,by early 1980 they demanded less gasoline at any given pricethan they did in 1978. In which direction would the demandline shift - to the right or to the left? 14.A shift in the position of the demand line is called achanged in demand. They occur when any one or more ofthe determinants of demand change.CHANGES IN SUPPLY 15.Certain factors determine the amount of a product that pro-ducers are willing and able to offer for sale at variousprices.These determinants of supply are: i)the prices of resources and cther factors of pro-duction;ii)technology;iii) the price of other products;iv)the number of producers;v)the producers' hopes for the future.16.So the amount of gasoline supplied at various prices inHoosierland on April 1, 1978 reflect (1) the prices ofresources and other factors of production, (2) the tech-nology, (3) the prices of other products, (4) the numberof gasoline producers and (5) the hopes of gasoline pro-ducers as they existed on that day in Hoosierland. Theresults are seen in Table One and Figure A.17.If any of these determinants change, the information inTable One,. column \"A\" would also change. Imagine for ex-ample, that on April 1, 1978 there were 10 gasoline pro- ducers in Hoosierland. Adding together the amount eachproducer would supply at various prices gave us the figures in column \"A\" of Table One.18.What would happen if in March of 1979 one more producerbegan supplying gasoline in Hoosierland? More gasoline would be offered for sale at each'price. The results are shown in Table Three. 8G86 TABLE THREE:SUPPLY AF GASOLINE, HOOSIERLANDMarch 1, 1979Amount Supplied gallon) 70,000 $2.0050,000 1.5045,000 1.2540,000 1.0030,000 .50 ,19.Use the information in Table Three to construct a supplyline in Figure C on the following page, for March 1, 1979.FIGUREPrice3.002.752.502,252.001.751.501.251.00.75.50.250C:SUPPLY OF GASOLINE, HOOSIERLAND, MARCH 1, 1979 Yar Supply April 1,1978 Demand 510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 85. 70 75 80, 85 90 95 1001051101.15120Gallons of Gasoline (Tens of Thousandsof Gallons) 20.Notice that the positiob of the supply line for gasolineshifted to the right (increased) when more producers en-tered the market.A shift in the position of the supply line is called achange in supply. It occurs when one or more of thedeterminants of supply change.FOREIGN OIL PROBLEMS21.Some of the gasoline offered for sale in Hoosierland is pro-duced from crude oil found within the country itself. Butsome of it is produced from crude oil imported from foreigncountries.' 22.In early 1980 the governments of these oil producing countriell,had a meeting. They decided to reduce the amount of crudeoil shipped to Hoosierland and other oil customers.23.As a result Hoosierland gasoline producers were forced topay much higher prices for the foreign crude oil they usedXo produce gasoline. This had two effects. Revenues goingto the foreign oil producing countries increased sharply.This, of course, was their reason for reducing exports ofoil.24.The other result was that gasoline producers supplied onlyhalf as much gasoline for sale, at any given price, as theyhad on April 1, 1978. The results are shown in Table Four.TABLE FOUR:SUPPLY OF GASOLINE, HOOSIERLANDFebruary 1, 1980 Amount Supplied Price 30,000 $2.0020,000 1.5017,500 1.2515,000 1.0010,000 .50 25.Use the information in Table Four to construct a supply linein Figure D below, for February 1, 1980.FIGURE D: 2.502.252.001.751.50Price'1.251.00.75.50.250SUPPLY OF GASOLINE, HOOSIERLAND, FEBRUARY 1, 19801110111111111111M11111111111111E1.01111111111111111MMIONIIIIIN11111111111111111111111ENNI111111111111111111101111MN1111111111111110M1111111M1111111111111111111111161 Demand EMIIIMINGINIII1111011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111Supply April 1,1978 (Tens of Thousands510 15 20 25 30 36 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 of Gallons)Ckelions of basollne 88 88 26.Now answer the following questions about Figure D in the space provided.

ECONOMICS IN THIS LESSON:Externalities are side-effects that result when the pr' suction or consumption of a good or service in the market direct'..' affects the welfare of others, without being reflected throu,A he price mechanism.Externalities occur in both production ar.4 consump- tion, and they can have positive or negative effects. For ex- ample, cigarette smoking is increasingly viewed as having detri- mental effects on non-smokers in close proximity to smokers; on the other hand, more schooling is regarded as improving the well- being not only of the individuals receiving the schooling but also of others through the creation of a better educated society. Pol- luting firms along rivers reduce the pleasure derived by people who might swim or fish ill the river.Externalities can be treated in various ways.Positive externali- ties or external benefits (resulting from education, forlexample) can be stimulated by subsidizing those activities which produce them.Negative externalities or external costs (resulting from pollution for example) can be corrected directly by those who produce the externalities', by giving subsidies to help to elim- inate the externalities, by compensating those people adversely affected by them, or by direct legal prohibition. If no correc- tion occurs, as often happens, the result is that social welfare is less than it would otherwise be. At the same time, govern- ment efforts to correct for externalities are not always success- ful.RATIONALE:The process of producing or supplying energy has always created major costs not borne by the prod cer of that energy. Such costs are called negative externs ities or external costs of production.A typical external c st of production is the damage caused by energy-related polluti n.In recent years, laws have been passed to try to internalize some energy-related external costs, for example, by requiring pollution control or increased mine safety. An external cost is internalized when the providers of a good or service pay that cost and pass it lib,- to the consumer. 91'90 Not all externalities are negative. Not all externalities areassociated with producers. Some result from the actions ofconsumers.However, in this lesson attention is given only tothe external costs associated with production of energy.If students are to understand the current energy situation theymust be aware of the external costs associated with energy pro-duction.They must also learn about efforts to internalizethese costs and the 4ffevts that the internalization of costs has on the price of energy.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:1On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1.Distinguish between internal and external costs ofproduction;2.Identify the internal and external costs involvedin examples of energy production;3.Suggest ways of internalizing some of the externalcosts involved in energy production.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE: A.Hand out the student materials and have the studentsread paragraphs 1-5. These paragraphs introduce theconcept of the internal costs of production. Review the characteristics of internal costs of productionwith students: a.costs of production, paid by producers. b.These are passed on to the consumer in theprice paid forthe good or service purchased. c.Internal costs of production are paid withinthe transaction between producer and consumer.d.The consumer receives benefits from the pro-ducer in return for paying for these costs. B.Ask students \"What are some of the internal costs of the egg farmer's business?\" They should answer -buying chicken feed, paying the doctor, buying andmaintainins equipment, etc. C.Have studelnts read paragraphs 6-10. These paragraphs introduce/theconcept of external costs of production.Review the characteristics of external costs of pro- duction with students: a.External costs of production are paid outsidethe transaction between producer and consumerin the following manner: b.The person paying external costs of productionreceives no benefits from the producer in re- turn for paying them. c.External costs of production arise when pro-ducers ignore certain costs involved in theproduction process. These costs are inflictedon someone else without compensation.D.Ask students \"What are some of the external costs of an egg farmer's b#siness? Who pays them?\" They should answer tha the farmer's neighbors pay the1 external costs of his business.These costs include, dizziness, inconvenience, the cost of medicine, lost property value and the costs of air-conditioning and sealing their homes.E.Have students follow the directions in paragraph 11. Answers to the questions related to paragraph \"a\" are given in the student materials. For the other para- graphs students might respond:b)i)the value of the fish no longer harvested;or the recreational value of the fish.ii)external;The coal producer did not pay to control the leaking of acid water fromthe mine.The fisherman must pay the coststhat result but receive no benefits for pay- ing those particular costsc)i)the cost of drilling for oil - equipmentlabor, transportation, etc.ii)internal;It is a cost that was paid bythe producer.It will eventually be paidby consumers in the price they pay forgas.But they do get a benefit. Plenty of gasoline is available.d)i)poor health is one cost; So is shortenedlife span and lost work.ii)external.The producer did not pay to con- trol \\air pollution.The people in the downwind town must pay the costs that result,but receive no benefits for paying thesecosts.NOTE:They may receive benefits(heat or light) from the generating station by paying for internal costs of productionin the form of utility bills. F.Have students follow the directions in paragraph 12. They should respond: 9392 WOOD SMOKE a.The'y are getting heat. At the same time theyhave been saving money on energy consumption. h.One cost is not being abscenery.If this persottthere may be medical costenjoy the localas small children .f c.For the old people who.s ay, there is the costof lung problems. For th9se who leave there isthe cost of giving up a Glace in which they wantedto liveO(Some of these people may themselves beproducing the smoke that is causing the problem.) WINDMILL a.The local people benefit to some extent because they are getting some electricity. But the mainbenefits will go to people who will obtain elec-tricity in the future at less cost due to improve-ments in windmills to be built in the future. b.the lost beauty of the mountain.the cost of noise created by the windmill's opera-tion;the cost of vibration which breaks things. REACTOR a.The ones who benefit'from the reactor are thepeople who receive electricity from it. (Thatmight include Jake.). b.He is losing business. This cost results notfrom a problem with the local reactor, but be-cause of a problem With the nuclear industryin general.The prOuction of nuclear energyhas saddled him with costs for which he is notcompensated. G.Have students think back on the three stories they justfinished and on the people who ended up paying externalcosts of energy production. Then ask \"Do you thinkit's fair that these people had to pay these costs?\"Have students explain their responses. Most studentswill probably say \"no, it i6 not fair. These peopleare being inflicted wifrvosts without compensation.\" 9394 H.To end this lesson - review the details of each story.In each case ask \"What do you think should be doneto solve the problem created by external costs, de-scribed in this story?\", and \"How can your suggestionsbe put into effect?\" Accept all reasonable suggestionsand implementation strategies.SUGGESTED EVALUATION STRATEGIES: 1.Have students define internal and external costs of pro-duction.Have them give examples of each. 2.Present students with short paragraphs describing costsrelated to energy production. Have them answer questionssimilar to those contained in paragraph 11 of the studentmaterials.Here are some possible paragraphs:a. 'Suppose carbon dioxide released by burning fossilfuels causes a warming of the earth. The mid-western corn belt becomes a desert, but vast newareas, of Canada and Russia become productive wheat -lands.' b.A worker installing a solar collector falls offthe roof and breaks her leg. She is laid up forthree weeks; however, her company (by law) carriesworker's compensation insurance that pays all hermedical bills. The company also has disabilityinsurance that pays her wages white she can'twork. 3.Have students examine situations similar to those containedin paragraph 12 of the student materials. Then have themanswer questions like those contained in paragraph 16 andstep H of the Teacher's Guide. Here is one possible story.COAL TRAINRural City is a small town in a Rocky Mountain state.The railroad track runs through the middle of town,dividing it in half.Recently, large coal mines have been opened 150 milesnorth of the town. The railroad carries coal from themines to electric power plants in other states, andalso to seaports for shipment to other countries.Mike Morley, the town's mayor, summarizes the viewsof many residents when he says: \"This used to be aquiet little town. Well, it's still little, but itisn't quiet anymore. Instead of maybe one train a day,now we have a train every hour, and they are noisy.\" Mr. Crosby, who owns an ice cream parlor on west MainStreet, says:\"I know I've lost business because ofthese trains.People come to town from the farms outeast.They want something. Maybe there's a train intown.No way to get through to my store, not whilethe train's coming through. Likely as not they'lljust give up and go home. And an ice cream cone isnot like a piece of hardware. A hammer people willbuy next trip. They'll never buy an ice cream to re-place the one they didn't buy last trip. This wholetown can just barely support one store like mine.Half a town can't.\"Dr. Brown, one of the town's two M.D.'s, is alsoworried:\"One of these days there's going to bea medical emergency, a fire, something like that,and help won't be able to get through. The. there'll be trouble. The town just has to face upto it:we have to raise money to construct an under-pass.\"Mothers are especially critical of the trains. Mrs.Ellen Glasgow says, \"These trainsvare a danger tochildren.The right-of-way isn't fenced, and trainscome through town at thirty miles an hour. Rightthrough our backyards, really. Children don't knowenough to keep out of the way. Two dogs were killed last year.Someday it'll be a child.\"The president of the railroad says, \"People need thiscoal, and the railroad is the cheapest way of getting the coal to them. Rural City grew up where it is be- cause of the railroad. It would be easier and cheaperto move the town than to relay the tracks.\" ISPIN OFFThe following activity is adapted from \"Using Economics in Social Studies Methods Courses,\" Joint Council for Economic Education.In this spin off activity, students are asked to make a decision after weighing the costs and benefits associated with the choices involved.You might want to use the following procedure:A.Have students read \"Robert Chamberlain's Decision\".B.Have students recount the details of the story as a group.,Ask students to decide individually what Robertshould do. (see question at the end of handout)D..Divide students into small groups (5-6) based on their choices. That is- students who voted to recommend spending the money together, etc. 9596 E.Have each group develop a list of 3 reasons tosupport their particular choice. Encourage stu-dents to use costs and benefits associated withtheir choice to help them develop their reasons.F.Discuss reasons as a class. 9796 STUDENT MATERIALS: INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COSTS 1.Imagine that you live in the country. Nearby is a piece ofland that is for sale. 2.One day a farmer buys the land. He opens an egg ranch. 3.There are several costs involved in the production of eggs.The farmer buys hens and roosters. He pays the veterinari-an to check their health. He must buy and maintain equip-ment. 'He also buys a lot of chicken feed. 4.The farmer pays for the chicken feed and these other costs of production. He knows that when he sells eggs, he willhave to get his costs back from his customers. 5.The chicken feed and these other costs of production arecalled internal costs of production. The farmer pays them.He then passes these costs along to the customer in theprices he charges for eggs. So they are costs that arepaid within the business transaction between producersand consumer.In this transaction, the consumer pays forthe farmer's cost of production, but gets benefits in re-turn.Fresh eggs to eat! 6.As it happens, there is one cost of production that thefarmer didn't pay. It is obvious to anyone living near- by that the egg ranch smells awful! It smells so bad your head spins, your eyes water. 7.In the course of production this farmer ignores one major cost - wastedisposal.As he says, \"It's my land so letthe chicken droppings fall where they may.\" 8.But now you, the egg rancher's neighbor, have some costs. What kind?Well, you pay for medicine to cure the dizzi- ness and watering eyes. You try to sell your house. But you are offered a lot less for it than you would have, re- ceived before the egg ranch was opened.You end up seal- ing your windows and buying an air conditioner.Will the farmer pay for your air conditioner? No, he doesn't see your air conditioner as one of his costs of production.Will he pass the costs of your air conditioner along to his customers? Why should he?Will the people who buy eggs from him pay you for the suffering you experiencedso that eggs could be produced on the ranch? No way! 97 10.Your suffering inconvenience and other costs are called external costs of production. They are costs created by the farmer's production activities. They result from his ignoring his waste disposal problem. External costs ofproduction are'not paid by the farmer (producer), theyare paid by you! They are outside the transaction between producer and consumer. You receive no benefits in returnfor paying these particular costs.11.Each of the paragraphs below describe a cost related to supplying or producing energy. Answer the questions asked about each paragraph. Use the space provided. An exampleis done for :you.a.A coal-burning boiler used to heat an office buildingproduces smoke which soils the brick walls of nearbybuildings.The owners of these nearby buildings payto have them steam-cleaned every seven years.i)What is the cost described in this paragraph? The owners of buildings pay to have them cleaned becausethey are soiled by smoke.ii)Is this an internal or external cost of energy produc-tion?Why?It is an external cost. The energy pro-ducer is not paying to control the smoke produced byburning coal in the office building furnace. Theowners of nearby buildings must pay the costs thatresult, but receive no benefits from the energy pro-ducer for paying these costs.b.Acid water draining from an old coal mine has killedall the fish in a stream. In that stream, sportfisherman used to catch about 700 pounds of fisha year. i)What is the cost described in this paragraph? ii)Is this an internal or external cost of energy produc-tion? c.An oil company spends millions of dollars drilling foroil.As a result gas stations supplied by t.h.is com-pany have plenty of gasoline available for customers. 9998 is the cost described in this paragraph ii)Is this an internal or external cost of energy produc-tion?Why?*d.In the 1940's, due to air pollution, a small towndownwind from a generating station had a higherrate of respiratory disease than a similar town up-wind.As a result, more work-days were lost in thedownwind town, and people tended to die younger. i)What is the cost described in this paragraph? Ii).Is this an internal or external cost of energy produc-tion?Why? 12.Each of the following stories describes a situation in whichthere is one or more external costs. The situations all in-volve energy use or supply. (It is important to realizethat external costs may occur in a wide variety of situationsThey are not associated only with energy related activities.)As you read a story, find answers to the questions thatappear before it.WOOD SMOKE a.What benefits are people getting'from wood burning? b.What costs does wood burning in Mercer put on the youngmarried person who heats his home with an electric 'beatpump? 99100 c.What costs do old people who stay in Mercer have as aresult of wood burning? What about the old people whomove? Mercer is a beautiful town in a rural mountain valley. Manypeople have come here to live just because of its beauty,including many retired people.Because the prices of other fuels have increased in thelast five years, many people in Mercer have started touse wood as their main home heating fuel. However, smokefrom the area's many fireplaces and wood stoves has cre-ated an air pollution problem. Now a blue haze hangsover the valley all winter long.At first, people didn't want to admit the haze wascaused by burning wood. Now they are asking the citycouncil to pass ordinances limiting the amount of wooda `home can burn.Part of the problem is the scenery. Th3 mountain peaksthat ring Mercer can no longer be seen.Health is involved, too. Infants and old people areespecially affected. Doctors have advised older peoplewith lung problems to leave Mercer. Even people who)have lived in Mercer all their lives are being forced'to sell their homes and leave.***WINDMILL a.Who benefits from the windmill? What benefits do theyobtain? b.Describe at least three external costs of productionthat people living near the windmill have as the re-suit of its operation. 100101 The Department of Energy has erected a large experimentalwindmill.The windmill generates electricity, which is fedto the homes of local residents, but its, main purpose is totest windmill designs. The knowledge that will be obtainedby operating this windmill will enable pepple to build lessexpensive, more durable wind generators in the future.But the people who live nearby complain.\"That windmill is the ugliest thing I ever saw,\" says BillHetherow.\"It looks like a plane crashed up there. That'snot what these mountains are about. If God wanted a wind-mill up there, he'd 'a put it there.\"Other neighbors complain that the windmill is noisy whenit is operating.\"Noise isn't the half of it,\" says Maureen O'Leary.\"That machine's cracked two of my best china cups. Ican just feel the rumble when it gets going.\" Engineerstesting the machine agree that it does generate subsonicfrequencies which might crack glass at a distance.\"That's one of the bugs we're working.out,\" they say.***THE REACTOR a.Who benefits from the reactor? b.What costs is Jake paying? JakeHolburn owns a little resort in an isolated rural sec-tion of the state. It includes cabins on a lake with adock and boats. Jake's place is a clean, pleasant, family-style resort.His regulars have been coming back year afteryear for almost as long as Jake has been in business. Thatis, until about two years ago.Jake's resort is a little more than a mile from a nuclearpower plant.In fact, the cooling towers of the plant areplainly visible in a photo on Jake's brochyre, rising up be-hind the hills on the other side of the lake.Jake says, \"My business started falling off right afterThree Mile Island. I couldn't figure it out. People areeven calling canceling reservations - families that had been coming for years. So finally I called up some cus-tomers I knew really well, and they told me why they weren'tcoming.\"Mrs. Lucinda Consuelo says, \"We've gone to Jake's for aboutfive years and we were very pleased with it. But afterhearing on the T.V. about them evacuating children - whenthey had that accident in Pennsylvania - and all that stuff,we decided, why take a chance? What if we were at Jake's when something happened? There are plenty of resorts wherewe can go.Why take the chance?\"Jake says, \"I don't know who's right and who's wrong in this nuclear thing. All I know is, I didn't do anything,and I'm going out of business.\" 103102Of ROBERT CHAMBERLAIN'S DECISION; HANDOUT This is the day Robert Chamberlain has worried about for a longtime.He is the manager of American Steel Company's plant inSteeltown.This afternoon he will be meeting with the companyBoard of Directors. He will be presenting his recommendationsfor dealing with air pollution caused by the plant's use of coal.Like other plant managers in Steel town, Robert has long been awareof the air pollution problems in town. The most recent crisisoccurred one day last November, after a temperature inversionsettled over the city. The next day the pollution index wasdangerously high7 Children as well as adults with respiratoryproblems or heart disease were warned to stay indoors and toavoid physical exercise. Robert's son Dennis had to be hospit-alized during the crisis. Dennis suffers from asthma.Conditions got so bad that week That the Environmental ProtectionAgency obtained a court order shutting down production at all Steel- ,town steel mills. The mills are still recovering from the loss ofbusiness that occurred during that shut-down. Sensitive to thelay off of 5,000 workers and the loss Of a considerable amountin wages during the EPA shut-down, labor union officials are-preparing to negotiate for contract clauses protecting theirmembers against wage losses when plants were shut down becauseof such emergencies.Several members of Robert's staff urged him to request thatAmerican Steel spend the $12 million needed for pollution con-trol.They pointed to the loss of business that occurred whenthe EPA. shut down the plant in November. That could happenagain.They also argued that if the EPA shut down AmericanSteel again the company might have to pay wages to laid-offemployees.Finally they warned that if the company did nothingabout air pollution, they would probably face class-action suitsbrought by outraged Steeltown citizens seeking payments for lossesthey had suffered because of the air pollution.Robert is aware of his staff's arguments. He also knows thatAmerican Steel is a fairly small company. He is not sure thatthe company can absorb the cost of upgrading its equipment. Ifthe cost is too great, he fears, hundreds of employees will loosetheir jobs, permanently.Robert is also concerned about certain members of the Company Boardof Directors.He is not sure that they would support spending moreto abate pollution. Many of the Directors are concerned about pro-fits.They might argue that adding another cost of production wouldrive the price of American Steel products up so high as to jeoperdine profits.If that happened his career with the company would 103.104 .i also be in jeopardy. He has worked hard to make a comfortable life for his family.Robert must decide what to recommend to the Board of Directors It is not an easy decision. But he must make up his mind. The meeting will be held in an hour.What do you think? Should Robert recomrind a $12 million expendi- ture for pollution control devices? 7 105104 ; LESSON 10:RESPONDING TO CHANGES THIS LESSON:Price is the principal allocating mechanism of the American econo-my.Prices act as \"signals,\" flashing information to households,producers, workers, savers, and investors, helping them to decidewhat are the most rational and profitable decisions to make.The array of prices confronting individuals and households helpsto determine the way they will spend their limited income. Theprices of finished goods relative to costs indicate to producersthe most profitable items to.produce while the prices of produc-tive resources determine other costs of production. Changes inprice affect the way consumers spend their money, where workerswork, how savings are invested, and what producers produce.RATIONALE:There.is one aspect of the energy situation in which everyone,isinterested - price. This lesson examines changes that have takenplace in the price of.energy. It then considers how people'sdecisions are affected by these price changes. The lesson isintended to introduce students to the impact of prices on people'sdecisions.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1..Obtain information from line graphs;2.Describe some recent trends in energy prices;3.Identify ways in which the decisions of energy pro-ducers and consumers are affected by energy pricechanges.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE:411 A.Using the overhead projector, show the graph of gaso-line prices.(NOTE: In some classes, it may be neces-sary to review the idea of line graphs. Several will 107- ...... .1. be used in this lesson. You may want to use thefollowing as part of your classroom review ofline graphs:Line graphs are useful for seeing the direction(usually upward or downward) that information takesover time.The gasoline prices line graph is aboutthe direction taken by prices between 1965 and 1981.On a line graph,lpoints are plotted for each piece ofinformation.The'distance of each point from the bot-tom of the graph depends on the particular piece ofinformation it represents.On the gasoline prices graph, a point is plotted foreach year.The distance of the point from the bottomof the graph represents the average price for gasolinein that year.The numbers along the side of the line graph help thereader determine the exact meaning of the points. Inthe gasoline price line graph, the numbers along theside stand for cents per gallon.The direction taken by the information is found byjoining each pair of points with a straight line.The results show the general trend in the information. B.Ask students \"What is this line graph about?\" To ans-wer this question have them inspect the graph title,check the graph sources, and examine the graph notes.They should say something like \"This is a line g aphabout changing gasoline.prices in the U.S. The pricesare adjusted for inflation. The information is fromthe U.S. Department of Energy, 1982. It is for theperiod 1965-1981.\" C.Point out to students that because the prices havebeen adjusted for inflation, they can be accuratelycompared.Also point out that the prices on the graphare not the prices that appeared on the pump at gaso-line stations. D.Have students describe how the prie of gasoline changedbetween 1965 and 1980. Ask them: i)How did prices adjusted for inflation change be-tween 1965 and 1973? (Student. response Pricesfell slowly.)ii)How did prices adjusted for inflation change be-tween 1973 and t974? (Sharp increase) 106108 v How did prices adjusted for inflation change be-tween 1974 and 1978? ',Slow decrease)iv)How did prices adjusted for inflation changeafter 1978? .(Very sharp increase)NOTE:Record these answers on the chalkboard forlater reference. E.Tell students that changes in energy prices affect de-cisions made by producers and consumers of energy.Have them speculate about how price changes seen inthe gasoline graph would affect producers and consumers.Ask \"How do you think energy prodLcers (oil companies)would respond to changes in gasoline. prices? If theprice of gasoline went up: Would they increase or de-crease the pace at which they drill for new oil\"tomake into gasoline? If the price of gasoline goesdown:Would producers do more or less drilling?\" Usea table like the .one that follows to record studentanswers.Drilling Activity Price of gasolineUpMore Less Down Ask \"How do you think energysonsumers would respondto changes in gasoline prices? If the price went up:would people use more or less gas? What would they doif the price fell? Use a table like the one that fol-lows to record student answers.Consumption of Gasoline Price of gasoline More LessUp Down Record student answers on the chalkboard. This record-ing should not be done for evaluation purposes butsimply to motivate students to examine the evidencewhich follows. 109107 F.Project the transparency \"Drilling Activity\". Ask stu-dents to describe changes in the number of new wellsdrilled since 1965 for the four time periods used 'inStep D, above.Record answers on the chalkboard sothat they can be compared to those developed in StepD.Students should respond: i)1965-1973:drilling activity slowed down(except for drilling activityiii) 1974-1978: an increaseiv)1978-sharp increase G.Have students spend a few minutes comparing' these re-sults to their predictions. Who was right? (With theexception of the 1974-78 period - activity increasedas prices went up, and slowed as price fell.) H.Ask students e'Why do you think oil companies wouldincrease their exploration activities (drilling newwells) when gasoline prices increased during thelate 1970's and early 1980's?\" A variety of answersare poSsible. 1.Show the transparency \"Automobile Gasoline Consump-tion\".Ask students to describe changes in the num-ber of gallons consumed per vehicle since 1965 forthe four time periods used in Step D, above. Recordanswers DM the chalkboard so that they can be com-pared to those developed in Step lat Students shouldrespond: i)1965-1973:ii)1973-1974:iii) 1974-1978:iv)1978-1981:consumption went upsharp decreasesharp increasesharp decrease J.Have students spend a few minutes comparing the resultsto their predictions. Who was right? (There is aclear relation between price and consumption. Whenprice fell, consumption increased. When price wentup, less was consumed). K.Ask students \"Why do you think energy consumers wouldpurchase less gas when the price went up in the late1970's and early 1980's?\" A variety of answers arepossible. L.To conclude this activity have students suggest otherways in which producers and consumers can respond toan increase in the price of a product like gasoline.They might suggest:Consumers could find substitutes for gasoline, like-1-kiakT-riding bus.108110 Producers could increase their productivity- makingbetter use of existing energy sources..Consumers could try to do without energy.SUGGESTED EVALUATION STRATEGY 1.Provide students with line graphs, of energy product priceslike electricity. Ask them to describe what the graphs areabout.Have them answer questions about the informationportrayed in the graph, similar to those posed in thislesson. 2.Ask students'to describe in writing or in graphic formtrends in prices of gasoline through 1981. 3.Create a list of short statements describing decisionsmade by energy producers and -consumers. Have studentsidentify those statements 'reflecting decisions mostlikely to follow from energy price increases,. Hereare some ,examples of decision statements. i)Consumers uge less natural gas to heat their homesthan previously (associated with an energy priceincrease).ii)Producers develop new techniques for extracting oilfrom existing wells (associated with an energy priceincrease).iii) Consumers start buying large \"gas-guzzler\" carsagain (not associated with an energy price increase).SPIN OFFIn 1983 the price of certain forms of energy began decreasing.Have students collect articles from news magazines that describethis trend.Have students use the contents of these articles toidentify the ways in which the decisions of energy producers andconsumers have been affected by this downward trend in prices.

CONCEPT:'Current Prices and Constant Prices\"Blackline masters provided. ECONOMICS IN THIS'LESSON:In studying energy it is often useful to be able to look at how prices of energy change over a long period of time. Whyis this useful?Because changes in energy prices affect decisions madeby producers and consumers.Unfortunately, any real 'change in the price of a good over time is usually obscured by inflation. Inflation is defined as aperiod of time when the average of all prices - or the general price level- is increasing.Economists adjust prices for inflation. This involves converting\"current\" dollars (price tag prices) into \"constant dollars.\"By examining prices expressed in constant dollars over a period of time it is possible to detect any real change in prices.RATIONALE:Price is the principal allocating mechanism of the American econo-my.Prices act as \"signals\" flashing information to households,producers, workers, savers, and investors helping them to decide what are the most rational and profitable decisions to make.It is therefore inevitable that any discussion of energy, from an .economic point of view, involves a consideration of prices.It is important for students to realize that any examination ofenergy prices over time must be made in terms of constant dollarsinstead of current Wilars. Current dollars obscure any realchanges that occur in prices.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1.Distinguish between \"current\" and \"constant\" dollars;2..Interpret price information expressed in constantdollars;119113 13.Recognize the importance of using prices expressedin constant dollars when examining price changesand their impact on decisions.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE:A.To begin the lesson say \"In studying energy it issometimes helpful to be able to look at how energyprices have changed over a period of time. Why?Because changes in energy prices affect decisions,made by producers and consumers about what to pro-duce, how much to produce and what and how much toconsume.\" B.Using the overhead projector, show Transparency I -\"Service Station Price of Gasoline.\"(NOTE:In some classes, it may be necessary tq re-view the idea of line graphs. Several will beAlsedin this lesson. You may want to use the followingas part of your classroom review of line graphs:Line graphs are useful for seeing the direction(usually upward or downward) that information takesover time.The gasoline prices line graph is aboutthe direction taken by prices between 1965 and 1980.On a line graph, points hre plotted for each pieceof information. The distance of each point from thebottom of the graph depends on the particular pieceof information it represents.On the gasoline prices graph, a point is plotted foreach year.The distance of the point from the bottomof the graph represents the particular average price charged by service stations in that year.The numbers along the side of the line graph help thereader determine the exact meaning of the points. In the gasoline price line graphs, the numbers along theside stand for cents per gallon.The direption taken by the information is found byjoining each pair of points with a straight line.The results show the general trend in the information.C.Ask students \"What is this line graph about?\" To ans- wer thir: question, have them inspect the graph title,check the graph sources, and examine the informationin the graph.They should say someting like: \"This is a line graph about changing gasoline prices chargedby service stations in 1965-1980 in the U.S. The in- formation is from the U.S. Department of Energy, 1982.\"11120 D.Ask students to describe how the price of gasolinechanged between 1965 and 1981. Did the price in- crease?Was it a slow steady increase or did it increase in jumps? Students should respond thatthe price increased gradually until 1973. Between 1973 and 1974 there was a jump in price. Then after another period of gradual increase from 1974-1978,the price shot up,again between 1978 and 1980.Write the following statement on the chalkboard.Introduce it as a basic idea in economics. (It is the \"Law of Demand\", adapted to gasoline):\"\"At higher prices, people are willing andable to purchase less gallons of gasolinethan at lower prices, other things beingequal.\" E.Review the meaning of this statement is a class.Besure students understand what it means: that as pricesincrease the amount demanded (the amount people are willing and able to purchase) decreases. Point out that the opposite is also true: \"at lower prices, people are willing and able to purchase more gallons of gasoline than at higher prices, other hings beingequal.\" F.Then hand out the worksheet, \"Fuel Consumption\". Have students follow the directions on the worksheet. Their rough graphs should look something like the one shown below - with a gradual decrease in consumption until1973, then a quick drop between 1973 and 1974 followedby another gradual decline and another big drop after 1978. GallonsperVehicle 1989 1989 1961 1088 1989 1070 1071 1911 1973 1974 1016 1970 1977 1978 1979 1980 115 As students are working on their rough line graphs,circulate among them to be sure they understand theassignment.NOTE:Some may not realize that theamount consumed is the same as the amount peopleare willing and able to purchase.Assure them that you are simply looking for arough sketch.You want them to draw in the trendin consumption.. You are not interested (nor is itlikely that they can predict) exact levels of con-sumption. G.When all students have completed their sketches:Project Transparency II - \"Automobile Fuel Consump-tion in the U.S., 1965-1980.\" Point out the graphon the transparency shows what actually happened!in terms of fuel consumption in the U.S. between,'1965 and 1980.HaVe students compare the sketch graphs they con-structed to the one on the transparency in termsof trends.Don't worry about actual levels ofconsumption in gallons. Ask them to identify somesimilarities and differences.Similarities: Differences:The period since 1973 is prob-ably similar to the studentgraphs and the transparency,although the transparency showsan increase in consumption be-tween 1974 and 1978, which stu-deAt graphs probably don't.The\\ period between 1973 is prob-ablwhere the main differencebetween student graphs and thetransparency exists. The trans-parency shows increased consump-tion and the student graph prob-ably shows a decrease in consump-tion. H.Then say, \"Why do the differences exist between thegraphs you constructed and the transparency? To an-swer this question, let's look at some more informa-tion,\"Then hand out \"Correcting for Inflation\". I.Have students read through paragraphs 1-4. Make surethey understand that current dollars simply refer tothe dollars (or cents) actually charged at a particu-lar point in time. They should also realize thatmince dollars in different years have differentvalues, they cannot be directly compared, withoutadjusting for these different values. t J.\\After students have read paragraphs 5-6, review the idea of a constant dollar. A constant dollar is a curz'ent dollar that has been adjusted for inflation.K.By working through the examples in paragraphs 8 and 9 students should be able to grasp what constant dollars mean as compared to current dollars.L.Remind students that, as paragraph 10 indicates, only prices expressed in constant dollars can be compared accurately.They have something in common - they are expre&sed in base year dollar terms.M.Paragraph 11 is intended to give students practice in working with constant dollars. You may ask them some other questions. They should respond to the questions in paragraph 11 as follows: 1981 constant dollar price 68.00 a gallon; current price 131.10 a gallon;adjusted 68.00 1972 dollars.N.Hand out worksheet \"Current Prices and Constant Prices.\" In response to the questions on the worksheet students should respond:.a)Theyf seem to be affected more by prices expressed in constant dollars. tt,b)Looking at the period 1965 to 19731 current prices went up, but constant prices went down. Consump-tion,seemed to react more to the trend in constant prices - since consumption increased. For the period after 1973 - consumption also seemed toreact to prices expressed in constant dollars.more - reductions in consumption were not asdramatic as the current price changes suggt_stedthey should be.0.To end this lesson, summarize as follows:i)Decisions of consumers and producers are influenced by price changes.ii)Prices are expressed in current and constant dollars.iii) 'Current dollar prices are difficult to compare,because the dollars involved do not have thesame value.iv)Constant dollars are current dollars adjustedfor inflation. The dollars involved have the same value. 123117 Decisions seem to be more sensitive to pricechanges expressed in real dollars than thosein current dollars.vi)So when you see information about changes inprice over time, check to see whether the prices -are expressedAn current or constant dollars.Ifthey are expressed in current dollars, be verycareful about comparing prices. Also be cautiousabout trying to predict consumer or producerbehavior based on changes in prices expressedin current dollars.CSUGGESTED EVALUATION PROCEDURE: 1.Have students define \"current\" and \"constant\" dollars. 2.Show students a table of current and constant prices.Here is one possibility. PRICES FORU.S. PRODUCED CRUDE 1981 Annual Report toCongress Then have students interpret what the constant price means. You can use a format like this: The crude oil price in 1970, expressed in constant dollars was cents per million BTU's. This means that when the 1970 price expressed in current dollars 'cents per gallon was adjusted for the inflation that occurred between and(the base year) the price of gasoline in 10D-was cents a gallon, expressed-in dollars.3.Have students answer this question. \"Prices can be expressed in constant or current dollars.

What does this mean? 2.During a period of inflation each dollar has less value, asthe years. go,by. In other words, each dollar can buy fewer,goods and services than it did before. . 3.Cbnsider th's situation: Service stations charged 31.2 cents )a gallon fogasoline ib 1965. In 1973 they charged 38.8a gallon. 4.These prices are expressed in current dollars. Currentdollars are the ones seen on price tags at a particularpoint in time. In the case of gasoline, the price thatyou see on the pump is expressed in current dollars. 5.Because of inflation a dollar was worth less in 1973 thanin 1965.So 38.E0 in 1973 was worth less than 38.80 in1965.This means that we can not tell, whether gasolihewas really 7.E4 more expensive in 1973 than in 1965.To be able to compare 1965 and 1971 gasoline prices acur-ately, both must be expressed in dollars of the same value.To do this, both must be adjusted to eliminate the effectsof inflation.When current dollars are adjusted to elimin-ate the effects of inflation, they become constant dollars.Table A shows current and constant dollar prices for gaso-line 1965-1980. Notice that constant dollar prices havea base year to which they all refer. In this table it is1972.Current price and constant price are equal. Theconstant dollar column shows the price of gasoline foreach year expressed in base year dollars.TABLE A:U.S. GASOLINE Energy1982 8.Let's return to our comparison of 1965 and 1973 gasolineprices.The current price column of Table A shows usthat in 1965 the gas pump price was 31.2 a gallon.Inconstant dollars it was 42.0 per gallon.What does thismean?It means that when the 1965 price expressed incurrent dollars - 31.2 per gal' ,r1- wao adjuste&forthe inflation that occurred be .kn 1965. and 1972 (thebase year) the price of gasolin.

The currentprice in every other year is adjusted tit) eliminate theinflation that occurred between that year and the baseyear, 1972.What you, are left with is a set of pricesall expressed in 1972 dollars. This means that all pricesare now expressed in dollars of the same value (1972 value).These prices can be compared. The price of gasoline wasreally lower in 1972 than in 1965 even though the currentprice was higher! 11.The price of gasoline in 1981 expressed in constant dollarsper gallon was .This means that when the 1981price in current dollars- cents per gallon wasadjusted for the inflation that occurred between(base year) and ,the price of gasoline iii-TW-wascenti-i-iirron, expressed in .dollars. 124 134421t...e.ro GallonsperVehicleWORKSHEET CURRENT PRICES AND CONSTANT PRICESBelow are three line gtaphs.

In our mixed economy, government plays akey role. Government influences the allocation of resources inseveral ways. Control over the production of some goods andservices (such as national defense, highways and justice) hasbeen removed from the private sector and placed in the publicsector where government makes the important decisions. Govern-ment also intervenes in many markets with regulations andcontrols with the intent to improve upon the results producedby the free play of market forces. Examples are public utilityregulation, tariffs, minimum wage laws, antipollution andsafety requirements, price ceilings and floors. Finally, throughits taxing and spending activities, government shifts controlover resources from private hands to the public, and it also..,redistributes income among individuals through transfer pay-ments. These activities influence, what' and how much will'beproduced, how it will be produced, and how it will be sharedor used.RATIONALE,:Price rations goods and services. Goods and services will goto those consumers who can and want to pay the market clearingprice.Sometimes a society decides that price rationing is not thebest way to allocate goods and services. Price ceilings aresometimes used to make sure that prices o some items such asfood or gasoline do not go too high.Price controls have side effects. It is important for studentsto understand why price ceilings are sometimes imposed, whatthe consequences (costs) are, and if the benefits are worth thecosts. In addition, students should examine alternatives tbprice ceilings.INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES:On completion of this lesson, learners will be able to: 1.Define \"price ceiling\".2.Identify situations in a price ceiling islikely to be imposed; 139128. 3.Identify who benefits and who incurs costs whena price ceiling is imposed;4.Explore the costs and benefits associated withcertain policy alternatives to price controls.SUGGESTED TEACHING PROCEDURE:NOTE:If \"ou have covered the lesson \"Supply, Demand and pricesit the Energy Market,\" with your students you can havethem move quickly through paragraphs 1-10 of the sttidentmaterials.

F.Paragraph 11 points out that price along withother things affects decisions made by consumersand producers.The idea presented in paragraph 12 actually intro-duces the main theme of this lesson. Have studentsread this paragraph carefully. Be sure they under-stand that price can play a rationing role.Have students read paragraphs 13 and 14. Reviewthe main points of these paragraphs as a class.1)price ceiling - a government price controlthat sets an upper limit on the price thatcan be charged for a particular good orserviceii)price ceiling - usually used when it is fearedt at the price of a vital basic good will betoo high for people, especially poor people,to ,afford. I.Paragraphs 15-16 \"set the scene\" for the establish-ment of a price ceiling in Hoosierland. This may bea good time to tell students that while Hoosierlandis a fictional place, the workings of the market andthe impact of the price ceiling are realistic. 141130 0 J.Have students read paragraphs 17 and 18. Ask \"Whydid the government of Hoosierland decide to imposea price ceiling on gasoline?\" They should respond\"The government feared that the burden of the newmarket clearing price was too great for people,especially the poor.\"Have students follow the directions in paragraph19.Their \"price ceiling lines\" look likethis:FIGURE October 1,.1980 2.252.001.75Price1.50PerGallon1.251.00.75.50.25IllonmesoilimiainummuninDAImoEmirmomumum011111111111111111111InurimmumIIIINIIIICOOM11111111111111111111EMI, (Tens of Thousands510 15 20 25 30 36 40 45 50 55 60 85 70 75 80 of Gallons )Gallons of Gasoline L.They should respond to the questions in paragraph20 as follows:a)30,000 gallonsb)20,000 gallonsc)The price ceiling was set below the marketclearing price. So, more gallons or gasolinewere demanded than were supplied. This re- sulted in a gasoline shortage. When a short-age occurs, people spend more time searchingfor gasoline and waiting in line to purchaseit.d)Answers may vary. Accept all reasonable sug- gestions such as:COSTSoThe poor themselves - time and money is wasted looking and waiting for gas; oEveryone else who must deal with theshortage by searching and waiting;131142 oPeople who work for oil companies. Com-panies have no incentive to produce moregasoline so they don't hire workersoGasoline stations - must deal with un-happy customers.BENEFITSoThose who manage to get some of the gaso-line at less than the market price withminimum or no search costs;oThose with few other ways to spend theirtime.M.Students might respond to the question in paragraph21 as follows:costs:government spending would be increasedbenefits:poor people would be helpedno shortages would developSUGGESTED EVALUATION STRATEGY: 1.Ask students to define price ceiling. 2.Provide students with short statements describing situationsin which prices change rapidly. Have them \u00b0identify whichif these are situations in which price ceilings are likelyto be imposed. Some sample statements: a.Because of the poPularity of jellybeans in Washing-ton D.C., the price of a pound incrc_._s from $.75a pound to $1.35 (No price ceiling likely, not avital commodity.) b.Because of a series of outbreaks of disease four yearsago, fewer cattle are being delivered to market. Theprice of ground beef increases froar$,89 a pound to$2.15 a pound. (Yes, a ceiling is possible here.) 3.Have students identify who would benefit and who would incurcosts if a price ceiling .was imposed in the situation de-scribed in 2 b. above.4.Have students identify one cost and one benefit that wouldresult from an income subsidy, rather than a price ceiling,being imposed in the situation described in 2 b. above.SPIN OFFThe role that government should play in controlling energy pricesistian issue often debated by labor leaders, consumer group mem-bers and energy industry executives. Invite representatives ofthese groups in to present their particular points of view. 14313 Encourage students to prepare questions to ask guest, speakers,using material in the lesson as a guide. For example-:oIs there ever a situation in which price ceilingsshould be imposed?oWhat are some consequences?oWho is aided, who is hurt by price ceilings?.Students should also \"role play\" interviewers and interviewees be-fore the guest comes to class. Students could use materialgathered from guest interviews as the basis for a debate on thepro's and con's of price controls. 133 144 STUDENT MATERIALS - PRICE CEILINGS BACKGROUND 1.Below is a table showing information about gasoline supplyandudemand for the fictional country of Hoosierland about 3 years ago.TABLE ONE:pgrimplpgcA\u00a7piqm,AppsignAND Amount 50,0002.The right hand column of Table One shows the demand for gaso-line in Hoosierland on October 1, 1980. Demand refers tothe amount of a product, in this case gasoline, that peopleare willing and able to purchase at various prices, otherthings being equal. The table says that if gasoline wasoffered foesale at $2.00 a gallon, the quantity demandedwould be 20,000 gallons. If the price was $1,00, theamount demanded would be 40,000 gallons. 3.Use the information in the \"price\" and \"amount demanded\"//columns of Table One to construct a line graph on Figure/ A below.Notice that in Figure A gallons Of gasoline are/ / shown along the horizontal axis. Price is shown along theverticle axis.

Supply., refers tothe.amount of a product, in this case gasoline, that pro-.ducers are willing and able to offer for sale at various`..'prices, other things being equal. The table says that if,'gasoline could be offered for sale at $2.00 a gallon, theamount supplied would be 30,000 gallons. If the price was$1.00 the quantity supplied wouldbe 15,000. gallons. 6.Use the inform'ation in the \"price\" and \"amount supplied\"columns of Table One to construct.a supply line graph onFigure A. 7.Which one of the following convulsions can be. drawn fromthe supply line graph you constructed?a)As price increases, the amount of gasoline suppliedalso increases.b)The quantity of gasoline supplied does not seem tobe affected by price.c)The amount of gasoline supplied decreases as theprice increases. 8.You will notice that there is one point in Figure A atwhich the demand line and the supply line intersect. .It its at the $1.75 a gallon price level.If the price of gasoline is $1.75 a gallon - 25,000 gal- lons will be,demanded and supplied. At that price pro- .ducers are willing and able to offer for sale the sameamount of gasoline as consumers are willing and able topurchase.10.One dollar and seventy-five cents ($1.75) is called themarket clearing price in this situation. All gasojineoffered for sale wou d be purchased.at that price.11.Price and other things (e.g., the price of cruderoil)determine how much producers' are willing and able to offer for sale. Prices and other things (e.g., income)also determine how much consumers are willing and able to purchase.At the market clearing price, the amounts are the same.135 146 12.Price also determines who will purchase the product. Ifgasoline, for example, is sold at $1.75 a gallon in Hoosier-land, 25,000 gallons will be purchased. But it will bepurchased only by those consumers who are willing and able to spend $1.75 for a gallon of gas.13.Sometimes governments decide that the price charged for aproduct is too high. This usually happens in the caseof basic goods and services like food, fuel, housing,and medical care. The fear is that poor peoplenot be able to purchase enough ofthese goods and ser-vices to satisfy their needs, if prices are high.14.In a situation like this, the government may controlprices by establishing a price ceiling. A price ceilingsets an upper limit on how much can be charged for a par- .ticular good or service. It is enacted by a government.15.Imagine that Figure B portrays the supply and demand situa-tion for gasoline in Hoosierland in early September, 1980.Notice that the market clearing price. was $1.25 a gallon.FIGURE B - DEMAND FOR GASOLINE, HOOSIERLANDSeptember 10, 1980 Price2.252.001.751.501.251.00.75 .50 .25011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111011111111111111,M11111111111111111111111110.11ME2Innimmgmsuummi11111111111111110111111111111111111111Demand MINN11111.111rdnIIIIIIMEM11111111.1/1111111111111111111111111111111111111111.111111111111111111111111111111111Supply A rll 1, 1978 510 15 2030 35 40 45 50 55 60 85 70 75 80 (Tens of Thousandsdeigns of Gasoline of Gallons) 16.Then in .September, 1980 Hoosierland gasoline_ producers de-cided, because of the higher price of crude oil-) to cutback on thamount of gasoline they were willing and, ableto supply iiteachprice level. The result was the situa-tion shown in Figure A, with a market clearing price of$1.75. 136147 17.The government of Hoosierland decided that $1.75 a gallonwas t'o high a price for people to pay for gasoline. Theyfelt that someone consuming 20 gallons of gasoline a weekwould end up paying $10,00 extra a week for gasoline. This,the government felt, was too much of a burden for peole,especially poor people, to bear. 18.The government enacted a law requiring gasol e stationsto charge no more than $1.50 a gallon. A price ceiling wasthus established as a $1.50. 19.Draw a straight line, parallel to the horizontal axis, allthe way across Figure A, at the $1.50 a gallon level,20.With the price ceiling line in place, answer the followingquestions:a) How much gasoline would consumers be willing and ableto purchase at $1.50 a gallon? rb) How much gasoline would producers be willing and ableto offer for sale at $1.50 gallon?c) When the price ceiling of $1.50 a gallon for gasolinewas established in Hoosierland, consumers spend muchmore time searching for service stations that had gaso-line to sell.They also spend more time waiting in lineto buy gasoline. ,Why do you think this was true?'d) Price ceiling are usually established to help poorpeople.Who benefits and who incurs costs when a priceceiling for gasoline 'is established?21.Many economists oppose price ceilings. They argue Illat supplyand demand (market conditions), not the government, shouldset the price for all forms of energy. They feel that oursociety would be best served if poor people were given anincome subsidy by the government to help them deal withprice increases.Review the situation described in paragraphs 16 and 17 above.What would' some of the costs and benefits be if the govern-ment of Hoosierland provided an income subsidy to the poor,in the situation described, instead of imposing a priceceiling?
