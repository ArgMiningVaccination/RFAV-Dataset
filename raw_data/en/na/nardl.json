Since its inception, the University has based its educational, clinical and research programs on the following key principles: T reatment of the whole person Prevention of disease Teaching patients how to take responsibility for their own health Enhancing each individual's inherent healing ability, using natural, nontoxic therapies Over the years the University has broadened its mission to integrate Western scientic standards with traditional natural healing methods from around the world. The University has expanded and strengthened the academic and clinical education of naturopathic medicine practitioners. It has developed unique aca- demic degree programs in acupuncture and Oriental medicine, nutrition, exercise science and wellness, herbal sciences, culinary arts, midwifery, and health psychology, as well as specialized nondegree programs that reflect its founding philosophy. The education of graduate natural health practi- tioners and highly qualied undergraduate students at Bastyr University emphasizes development of the scientic understanding of the structure and function of the human body and the disease process, bal- anced with a profound appreciation for, and ability to activate, the unique self-healing ability inherent in every human being. The University's educational approach is an integrated one, offering traditional didactic instruction combined with innovative, prob-lem-based learning in rigorous academic and clinical environments. The learning experience emphasizes academic excellence, the development of individual talents and mastery of critical competencies. Students learn under the guidance of outstanding faculty. More than 90 percent of the University's health sciences core faculty members have earned doctoral degrees, and many are successful private practitioners who contribute a wealth of practical experience to classroom and clinical instruction. Laboratory experiments, demonstrations, clinical experience and case-oriented instruction help stu- dents develop practical, patient-oriented skills and understanding. Student clinicians are also trained to recognize when other modes of treatment are in the best interests of the patient and to make ap- propriate referrals to colleagues in other health care professions. Bastyr University is dedicated to educating indi- viduals to meet the health and well-being needs of the twenty-rst century. In practice and through research, Bastyr graduates will further develop ways in which to integrate scientic and traditional heal- ing methods in support of the innate healing power of the individual as part of the great human com- munity. B ASTYR UNIVERSITY VISION STATEMENT As the world's leading academic center for advanc- ing and integrating knowledge in the natural health arts and sciences, Bastyr University will transform the health and well-being of the human community. B ASTYR UNIVERSITY MISSION STATEMENT We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature and recognizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsi-cally inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service. B ASTYR UNIVERSITY VALUES Compassion CommunityIntegrityConnection to NatureWhole Systems Health In pursuit of its vision and mission, the University is characterized by: Academic excellence: curricula that present the cutting edge of natural medicine philosophy and practices; programs that facilitate student development of high-level academic and/or clinical expertise; utilization of teaching meth- odologies that optimally facilitate student skill and knowledge base development; and an educational environment that incorporates and models the principles of natural medicine (FOFSBM\u0001*OGPSNBUJPO4 G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ I NTRODUCTION Pioneering research: foundational inquiry into the underlying concepts of natural medicine; it- erative research that continuously evaluates the efcacy of therapeutic strategies and agents; and research partnerships to deepen and broaden the kinds of possible inquiry Renowned clinical services: cutting-edge natu- ral medical care; instruction that helps students model ideal clinical practice behaviors; and collaborations that provide opportunities to explore and develop integrated care protocols and clinical practices For the University to fully meet these commit- ments, it must think and act strategically. Following a campus-wide, iterative and broadly-inclusive pro- cess, the University's Board of T rustees in December 2008 adopted and committed itself to the following core strategic initiatives: Strategic Initiative #1: Convene essential gen- erative conversations that inform the cultivation of practitioners and influence policy decisions that contribute to restoring the world's intrinsic health. Strategic Initiative #2: Determine what academic programs are essential to a robust and universal education in the natural health arts and sciences and ensure that each program is focused on the achievement of excellence. Strategic Initiative #3: Attract, support and retain world-class faculty and staff in the natural health arts and sciences. Strategic Initiative #4: Attract, support and re- tain world-class students representing different cultures. Strategic Initiative #5: Our methods of and access to instruction are innovative enough to attract the most diverse and qualied students, while maintain- ing the highest standards of academic, research and clinical excellence. Strategic Initiative #6: Establish a secure base of nancial support and appropriate physical assets so we can invest in and support those things that ensure we will always lead the way in education, research and clinical practice of the natural health arts and sciences. Bastyr University has played a key part in es- tablishing the credibility of science-based natural medicine and initiating the current transformation of the health care system. In order to retain the Uni- versity's leadership role in promoting the benets of natural medicine, we will continue to improve and transform the institution into a fully-developed, well- nanced mature academic center for the natural health arts and sciences.G LOBAL COMPETENCIES AT BASTYR UNIVERSITY Bastyr University has developed global competen- cies in three major areas to help students succeed in their chosen elds in the natural health arts and sciences.

The average age of the 996 students enrolled at the University in the fall of 2010 was 31, with a range in age from 19 to 66. The demographics across various programs are fairly similar. More than three-quarters of the stu-dents are women. About half of the student body is from the Pacic Northwest, and in fall, 2010, 47 U.S. states were represented. International students are an important part of the Bastyr community. In 2010-2011, 32 foreign national students, represent- ing 11 countries, were enrolled. S TUDENT PARTICIPATION The major focus of student participation is the Bastyr University Student Council. The council determines how student activity fees are spent, ap- points students to various committees, represents student interests to the administration and allied professional organizations, and continually seeks to promote the University and meet the needs of students. The Student Council, like the University as a whole, relies upon student participation to create a more effective learning environment. The Student Council's constitution may be found online at MyBU. The Student Council hosts numerous events during the year, including potluck dinners, dances, a talent show, graduation parties and Bastyr Com- munity Day. The council has made significant contributions to the University, including sponsor-ing community events, remodeling the movement room and sponsoring the student exercise room, providing remote viewing for some classrooms, as well as equipment for the library and other Univer- sity departments. Each student is required to pay a $25 student ac- tivity fee every quarter. These funds are administered by the Student Council and used to support student activities, organizations, programs and services. With these funds, events like Bastyr Community Day, expansion of the herb garden, and free or par- tially-subsidized concerts, lectures and workshops are made available to students. The funds are also used to purchase equipment for the University for general student body use, such as additional com- puters for the library, a laptop with LCD projector and video equipment. The Student Council recognizes ofcial student organizations. In the past several years these orga- nizations have included the following: 12-Step GroupAction AfricaAmerican Naturopathic Physicians Rock Naturopathic Physicians (WANP) Yoga Club7 G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ S TUDENT AFFAIRS 4UVEFOU\u0001\"GGBJST The division of student affairs at Bastyr University provides support and services for students to meet personal and professional goals. The student affairs staff at Bastyr University consists of the dean of students' ofce, admissions, nancial aid, the registrar's ofce, the Student Resource Center, student housing, the Counseling Center, the T utoring Center, marketing and media, career and alumni ser- vices, as well as services for international and veteran students and students who access services under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Student Policies and Procedures are available online at MyBU. D EAN OF STUDENTS /VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS The dean of students' ofce supervises student affairs and professional staff, plans and conducts orientation and commencement activities, advises student organizations, oversees the Student Resource Center, facilitates communications within and among the University's constituencies, and resolves grievances. ADMISSIONS The Ofce of Admissions works with all prospec- tive students for degree and certicate programs at the University. In addition, the admissions de- partment coordinates campus tours, information sessions, webinars, campus visits and off-campus events to highlight the academic opportunities at the University. R EGISTRATION The registrar's ofce maintains students' academic records, manages course scheduling, handles aca- demic registration and evaluation, records grades, produces transcripts and grade reports, and provides academic advising and evaluation, as well as inter- national and veteran student services. Bastyr University operates on the quarter system. The University's quarter is 11 weeks long. (Summer quarter classes are generally eight weeks; summer clinic is 11 weeks.) Eleven hours of class constitute one credit hour, and 22 hours of lab/practicum constitute one credit hour. Continuing students preregister for courses and clinic shifts by submitting a preregistration form. The preregistration forms must be turned in before the registrar's ofce will register a student for classes or clinic shifts.Registration for continuing students takes place in the spring for summer and fall quarters and in the fall for winter and spring quarters. New students are automatically registered for their fall quarter courses, beginning in late spring and after they have paid their confirmation deposit. Nonmatriculated students may register for courses after matriculated students have been registered. Priority for courses is given to matriculated students. Students taking a course for credit have preference over students auditing a course. Students auditing a course or clinic shift (regardless of matriculation status) will be withdrawn if the course is full and an eligible student elects to register for the course, for credit. Students taking a course that is re- quired for their major have preference over those taking the course as an elective. If a student has withdrawn from her/his program, s/he may only take subsequent program courses with permission from the dean of the school from which the student has withdrawn. Students may elect to audit a course or change their status in a course from an audit to a grade through the second week of the quarter. However, after the rst week of the quarter, standard refund policies apply. After the second week, a student may not change from a graded option to an audit option or from an audit option to a graded option. Course add/drop/withdrawal forms are obtained from and returned to the registrar's ofce. Classes may be added or dropped from a student's schedule through the add/drop period (ending the close of the rst week of each quarter). After the rst week of the quarter, all withdrawals will be noted with a W grade on the transcript (except in the case of weekend intensive classes or non-traditionally scheduled classes that have not yet begun). Assigned clinic shifts may be traded during the shift change period. Elective clinic shifts may be added during that same period. Clinic shift drops are accompanied by nancial pen- alties. (Please see the registrar's ofce for additional information.) Withdrawal from classes is not permit- ted during the nal three weeks of a quarter (see the nancial policies section for the refund policy and page 144 for a refund schedule). For courses with concentrated scheduling (not evenly spaced through- out a quarter), the timing of additions or drops varies. (In no case may students drop or withdraw from a course after the course has ended.) Students must check with the registrar for specic deadlines. F INANCIAL AID Prospective students, current students and alumni all work with the Ofce of Financial Aid on nancial 8 G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ S TUDENT AFFAIRS planning for their education.

PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION All campus students and employees, includ- ing adjunct faculty, are required to register their transportation choices, whether driving a car or not. This must be done either online or by paper G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ F INANCIAL POLICIES11 form within two weeks of the start of fall quarter (or whichever quarter is rst attended by a student). This information allows us to manage our parking availability, give incentives to carpoolers, track our carbon footprint and offer several services. For instance, we offer a bike rental program, which al- lows full-time students to rent bikes on a quarterly basis. In addition, we have a free shuttle service on weekdays throughout the quarter between the main campus and Bastyr Center. Campus parking fees for fall, winter and spring quarters are $40/quarter for those who are parking on campus three or more days per week. Parking two days or less per week costs $20 per quarter. Carpooling two or more times per week is also $20 per quarter. Parking one day or less per week is free. There is no fee in the summer. These fees help defray the large expenses of build- ing and maintaining our parking stalls. Automatic inclusion of parking fees with tuition or by payroll deduction is strongly preferred, but payment by cash or check is accepted if auto deduction is not possible. Citations range from $10 to $100 depending on the seriousness of the infraction. We do this to en- sure that parking spaces are equally available for all. Citations are generally given to those who have not registered their transportation information, those who do not have the current Bastyr identication on their cars and those who are incorrectly parked. Parking nes are due within two weeks. After two weeks, the fine is automatically charged to the student's account. For more information on transportation and parking issues, please see the T ransportation web page on MyBU, which is within the Facilities sec- tion. O THER COSTS Books and supplies cost approximately $700- $2,500/year, depending upon the program of study. Naturopathic medicine students are required to purchase diagnostic equipment at the beginning of NM6221 Physical/Clinical Diagnosis 1 at an estimated cost of $1,000-$3,000. REFUNDS Dropping all classes by or before the end of the rst week of classes entitles a student to a 100 percent tuition refund. An add/drop fee is charged after the free add/drop period has ended. Any clinic drops are accompanied by nancial penalties. (See clinic registration staff in the registrar's ofce for more information.) Refund calculations for drops or withdrawals from classes after the rst week of the quarter are found on the inside back cover of the catalog. For those students receiving federal nancial aid, the federal calculation for the return of Title IV funds is required, and refunds will be returned on behalf of the student to the federal government. Amounts are determined by federal regulations. Students with nancial problems that will affect the payment of tuition and/or fees should contact the nance ofce at once to make satisfactory ar- rangements. The deadline for contesting a charge on a student account is 90 days from the close of the quarter in which the charge is applied or 90 days from the actual posting, whichever is later. Financial policies, like all policies of the Uni- versity, are subject to change and revision by the management and/or Board of T rustees of the Uni- versity. Notice of changes is published in MyBU.

Specialized care options include an immune wellness program for people living with HIV/AIDS, ADHD treatment and wellness care, diabetes and cardiovascular wellness care, pediatric wellness care, women's wellness care, and senior wellness care. Early in 2006, Bastyr Center moved to a newly renovated building in the Fremont/Wallingford neighborhood, designed to provide an enhanced environment for promoting health and healing for patients, staff and students. The expanded Bastyr Center features a Chinese herbal medicine dis- pensary and a larger natural medicine dispensary, offering a wide selection of natural health care products and a variety of gift items. Bastyr Center recently became the rst natural health care clinic in the region to receive LEED-CI Certication from the U.S. Green Building Council for compliance with high environmental standards. LEED-CI is the recognized standard for certifying high-performance green interiors that are healthy and productive places to work, less costly to operate and maintain, and have a reduced environmental footprint. This past year, the University obtained additional space in the building and is in the process of adding several classrooms and other improvements. Bastyr Center is located at 3670 Stone Way North in Seattle. Parking is available onsite for patients and on the street for students, faculty and staff. For more information, please visit www.BastyrCenter.org. Bastyr University maintains numerous external clinical learning sites, creating tremendous diversity in student clinical education and experiences.

Summary policies and proce- dures that apply to undergraduates are described in the catalog under \"Bastyr Undergraduate Programs\" beginning on page 28 of this catalog. The Academic Policy and Procedure Manual , Student Policies and Procedures section of MyBU and all versions of the Student Clinician Handbook provide complete infor- mation on all academic policies and procedures. ACADEMIC STATUS The University uses the following terms to denote academic status: Good StandingAcademic Warning ProbationFinal ProbationSuspensionDismissalA student whose status is anything other than Good Standing may be required to sign a learning contract, develop an academic improvement plan and/or be held to other sanctions. In addition, students under Academic Warning, Probation or Final Probation status must complete at least two successive quarters with no academic difculty in order to petition for a change of status. A change in status is the decision of the student's school or department Student Progress Committee (or the dean or dean's designee). Depending on the nature of the academic deciency, the categories above are not necessarily followed sequentially. A CADEMIC SUSPENSION POLICY Academic suspension is used when the dean of the school believes a student will benet from time away from his/her program and has sufcient op- portunity to be successful upon his/her return from suspension. The terms of a suspension are unique to each student and are decided by the dean. Suspen-sion will last at least one quarter, and a student may be required to receive remedial academic assistance before being readmitted. Suspended students must petition the dean for reinstatement, may be required to meet with the dean, and must show that all terms of the student contract, improvement plan and/or other requirements have been met before receiving approval to return to the University. If a student is unable to demonstrate that s/he has adequately resolved the issues that led to suspension, the student may be eligible for dismissal. Removal from a course or clinic shift may be war- ranted in the case of a student's failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expecta- tions that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student, staff or faculty member. Removal from a course or clinic shift constitutes a failure of that class or shift and is not eligible for remediation. R ECOMMENDATIONS FOR DISMISSALS Recommendations for dismissals from the University usually occur in the case of any of the following: 1. Failure to satisfactorily adhere to the terms of the established learning contract or academic improvement plan 2. Failure of the same class twice3. Failure of two clinic shifts4. Three failures in the same quarter5. A history of poor academic performance rel- evant to the appropriate department 6. Removal from a course/clinic shift in the case of student failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expectations that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student or faculty or staff member D ISMISSAL POLICY Each school of Bastyr University has a Student Progress Committee that follows the individual school dismissal policy. Recommendations for dismissal are submitted to the provost for consider- ation. The provost will make the nal decision on student dismissals. A PPEAL OF ACADEMIC SUSPENSION OR DISMISSAL An appeal of academic suspension or dismissal is submitted to the provost and can only be made in the event of factual error. The written appeal must be made to the provost within ve working days of the date on the suspension or dismissal letter or e-mail. The appeal must specify and include the alleged docu- mented inaccuracy and the relevance of the fact(s). The provost will respond within 10 working days to an appeal of academic suspension or dismissal and can only consider an appeal based on an error of fact. The decision of the provost is nal and can- not be appealed. G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ A CADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES14 NON-ACADEMIC SEPARATION If an instructor, faculty member, clinic supervisor or university administrator determines that a stu-dent's behavior, performance or professionalism in the campus, classroom or clinic setting is disruptive or otherwise impeding the student's own success or the success of others, the instructor, faculty member, clinic supervisor or university administrator may take whatever steps deemed appropriate to remedy the situation up to and including requiring the student to leave the classroom, clinic shift, and/or university property for the remainder of the day. A student who is removed from a class, clinic shift or the university property may also be subject to suspension or other discipline. L IMITS ON STUDENT CREDIT LOADS Bastyr University degree programs are described under each school or department listing in the Bastyr University Catalog . The recommended di- dactic program for each year and track of the degree programs is specied. Elective courses and clinic credits are expected over and above the required didactic courses. The Student Policies and Procedures section of MyBU specifies the requirements for full-time, half-time and less-than-half-time enrollment status for each program. Capable students may choose to exceed the full-time recommended enrollment in order to include important electives or special inter- ests in their programs. However, the following are the maximum credit loads for which students may register in each program in any given quarter: Bachelor of Science ................................... 20 credits Master of Science in Nutrition (all tracks) 24 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture ........... 25 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ................................. 25 cre dits Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ............................................... 3 0 credits Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine ............ 30 credits Students who are seeking degrees in multiple programs must plan their registrations carefully so that they do not exceed the stated limits. Students in dual programs may use the credit limit of either program. In extraordinary cases, very capable students may be allowed to exceed the maximum for their programs upon approval by their department chairs. Department chairs indicate their approval by sign- ing the students' registration or add/drop forms and noting the credit load being approved. Any approved increase may not exceed 10 percent of the above totals. ATTENDANCE POLICY Course and Lab Attendance Policy Bastyr University does not have a universal course and lab attendance policy. However, faculty mem- bers may establish attendance requirements for their course(s) or lab(s). Some state licensing boards and the Veteran's Administration require 90 percent attendance. Students receiving nancial assistance from the Veteran's Administration or students who need to meet state licensing board requirements are responsible for notifying the faculty of their need to document attendance. When a student has an excused absence, the fac- ulty member may require that the student complete an assignment to make up for the time missed. An absence is considered excused if the student has a legitimate personal emergency, a serious illness or a documented birth (midwifery program students), as long as the student calls the faculty member(s) or leaves a message for the faculty member(s) with the faculty services department regarding the situation in advance (24-hour voicemail is available). Faculty may require documentation upon return from the excused absence. It is the student's responsibility to meet with the faculty member to discuss the absence and make up work upon return. Not meeting the stated attendance requirements for the class may affect the student's nal grade, and a student may be required to take the course again. In addition to possible consequences for absences, habitual tardi- ness may be taken into account by faculty as part of the course grade and/or may be reported to the dean of students for disciplinary action. Students cannot register for two courses or labs that are scheduled at overlapping times. Credit can only be applied to a single course at any one given time. Students cannot attend a course without be- ing registered for it and must attend the section of a course or lab for which they are registered. Failure to follow this policy may result in loss of course credit or a course grade of no show (NS). Clinic Attendance Policy All student clinicians are required to attend at least 80 percent of each assigned quarter shift in order to receive a grade of achieved competency (AC). Holidays and emergency closures of the clinic do not gure into the total quarter attendance. A student who does not attend at least 80 percent of the shift (two excused absences) will receive a G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ A CADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES15 failure grade for that shift and lose all accumulated patient contacts and hours for that shift. The entire shift would need to be taken again. Exceptional circumstances resulting in a third absence may be approved at the discretion of the supervisor. Four or more absences will result in an automatic failure for that shift. Please note that 100 percent of the required clinical hours must be completed before recommendation for graduation. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook - Global Module for further details. Religious or Spiritual Holidays The University's policy is to attempt to accommo- date the observance of religious practices. Religious absences will not count against any attendance requirement, but students are responsible for the in- formation and material covered. Students observing such holidays are required to notify faculty during the rst week of classes as well as nd substitutes for clinic shifts affected. Students should follow the reschedule exam procedures in the event an exam falls on a religious holiday. Bastyr University schedules clinical training and occasional required courses or intensives on weekends. Students with religious restrictions against attending classes on weekends need to contact their program chairs, in advance, when such conflicts occur. Efforts will be made to resolve such conflicts, but a resolution cannot be guaranteed. Convention, Conference, Seminar and Work- shop Attendance Policy Occasionally, there may be professional conven- tions or conferences offered during the academic year that programs encourage their students to at- tend. Students who wish to attend must receive advance permission from their instructor(s) if there is an attendance requirement for the class or an exam or project due during that time. Students are responsible for the information and material missed. Students who receive permission must arrange with faculty to take missed quizzes and exams immedi- ately upon return. Students must also comply with clinic absence policies. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook - Global Module for further details. U NIVERSITY CLOSURE In the event of unplanned school closures for weather or community emergencies, students are required to make up missed course requirements or clinic contact hours. Should the duration of the closure be too long or too late to make up missed requirements/hours in the time allotted, the Univer- sity reserves the right to extend the quarter and/or academic year to allow for additional make up time. Please see the inclement weather policy/procedure on MyBU for more information regarding Univer- sity closure. C RIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS Bastyr University requires national background checks for all students enrolling in clinical training courses. Background checks must be completed prior to any student contact with patients at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, an afliate clinic or a practicum or preceptor site. Students will also be required to immediately notify the dean or department chair of their program and their clinical training program supervisors if charged with and/or convicted of a felony after the background check has been conducted. Students should also note that Bastyr University requires that all felonies be disclosed at time of application for admission. Failure to comply with these disclosure requirements may result in immediate dismissal from the University. See \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. P OLICY ON TB T ESTING AND HEPATITIS B IMMUNIZATIONS These policies were enacted to protect the health and safety of employees and students who may be exposed to certain biohazards in the campus and clinic working environments. Tuberculosis Screening All faculty, staff and students who work or have shifts at Bastyr Center for Natural Health are re- quired to be screened annually for tuberculosis (TB), and are responsible to provide documentation of their results. Screening results can be submitted di- rectly to the Facilities and Safety Ofce on campus, room 110, or to the TB Results box, outside the Medical Records service window at the clinic. Bastyr provides two TB testing clinics each year, and all are encouraged to have their screening per- formed in sync with these week-long clinics, called TB Weeks. T wo screening options are available: T uberculosis Skin Test (TST) or QuantiFERON blood test (QFG). G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ A CADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES16 Students pay $10 toward the cost of their TST at the TB Week clinic, or $20 at Bastyr Center. QFG is available at Bastyr Center for an approximate cost of $110. If a chest x-ray is necessary, Bastyr University agrees to pay $37.50 toward this cost. Questions regarding TB screening or requests for forms can be addressed to the campus Facilities and Safety Ofce or to the Safety Manager at the clinic. Hepatitis B Immunizations All ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students, AOM and ND faculty and staff at Bastyr Center, and faculty or laboratory and operations assistants who are category I (those who have daily exposure to blood or body fluids) and category II (those who have occasional exposure to blood or body fluids) are required to either take the hepatitis B immunization series, provide documentation that they have had such immunizations in the past 10 years, or sign a waiver refusing the immunizations along with a release of liability form. Bastyr University agrees to pay 50 percent of the cost of the hepatitis B immunization series for students. Note: All students are required to pay in full the cost of testing antibody levels for any of the agents listed above, if they choose to check for individual immunity, prior to waiving or taking any immu- nizations. Commencement of the immunization series (or submission of a waiver) and TB screening shall oc- cur before the rst day of work for all faculty and staff, and before ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students begin their clinic shifts. Hepatitis immuni- zation forms/waivers are distributed to students in one of their required clinical courses. Hepatitis im- munization questions can be directed to the Blood Borne Pathogen Safety Ofcer. Anyone who has elected to waive the immuniza- tion series has the option to change that election, at any time, and take the immunization series. D EGREE AND CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS To earn a degree at Bastyr University, a degree candidate must have completed the prescribed curriculum (refer to the specic academic program section), earned passing grades in all required courses and clinic shifts, satised the requirement for total degree or certicate credits and been recommended for graduation by the faculty. To be eligible to graduate with a master's degree or graduate-level certicate, the candidate must have a minimum GPA of 3.0; a bachelor's degree candidate must have a minimum GPA of 2.0. Students in the articulated bachelor's/master's AOM degree program must fol- low the degree requirements of that school. A student is held to degree requirements in ef- fect at the time of initial matriculation unless legal or accreditation standards mandate a change to an existing degree or certicate program. Those degree and certicate requirements are published in the edition of the Bastyr University Catalog that is in effect at the time of rst matriculation. In rare circumstances, a course may be deleted from the required curriculum and/or curriculum substitu- tions may be made at the discretion of the school or the University. A student who is readmitted after an absence of more than one calendar year may be held to the requirements in effect at the time of his/her return or may elect to graduate under degree or certi- cate requirements specied in a subsequent Bastyr University Catalog with written permission of the program dean/chair. Under no circumstances are the requirements from an earlier catalog applied. Students in the ND and MSAOM programs must complete their degrees within six years. (In extraordinary circumstances, a one-year extension may be approved for ND students.) Students in the DAOM, MSA, MS Midwifery and MS nutrition programs must complete their degrees within ve years. There is no time limit on the completion of undergraduate programs. Students in all degree and certicate programs must have discharged satisfactorily all nancial obli- gations to the University (tuition, fees, library nes, and all other charges), including the graduation fee, for each program in which a degree or certicate is to be awarded. For students who have not met their nancial obligations at the time of graduation, the earned degrees and certicates are posted to their records, but diplomas and ofcial transcripts are held until the nancial obligations are cleared. D EADLINES FOR THE AWARDING OF DEGREES The awarding and posting of degrees at Bastyr University are governed by the deadlines. These deadlines affect the actual awarding of degrees. Stu- dent participation in commencement ceremonies is governed by a separate policy. The dates for nal examinations each quarter and for commencement ceremonies are published in the Bastyr University Catalog and the registrar's quarterly calendar. For all bachelor's, master's and professional doc- toral degrees awarded by Bastyr G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ A CADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES17 All coursework must be completed by the last day of the quarter for graduating students. Any IP , I or PC grades in coursework or clinic shifts must be replaced with passing grades no later than the last day of the quarter. If a student has any outstanding course or grade requirements on the last day of the quarter, his/her degree will be posted at the close of the subsequent quarter. GRADING POLICY Grades are assigned based on the grading system of the department/program offering the course, rather than by the academic program in which the enrolled student is matriculated. Core courses required for an academic program will be graded according to the normal grading policy for that program. Naturopathic Medicine/Dietetic Internship Bastyr University provides a competency-based learning format in the classroom for students in the naturopathic medicine program, clinic courses and the dietetic internship program. A competency-based evaluation of student work and performance is structured on the premise of demonstrating competence of a well-dened set of information and/or skills. With a competency system of grading, a student is aware of the learning objectives and core com- petencies for each course and clinic shift, knows how knowledge and understanding of these objec- tives and competencies are measured, and has the opportunity to demonstrate mastery by means of quizzes, exams, papers and/or practical application. The competencies established for each course reflect the goals and objectives of the appropriate program of study. Program and department chairs in the professional programs, in consultation with the faculty, determine the requirements and standards that students must meet in order to earn a grade of Achieved Competency, Partial Competency or Failure. Naturopathic Medicine Degree Program, Dietetic Internship and Clinical Shifts AC - Achieved CompetencyPC - Partial CompetencyF - Failure I - Incomplete - Personal emergency or seri- ous illness W - Withdrawn -Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and led in the reg- istrar's ofce at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. The W grade is transcripted for all course withdrawals after the rst week of the quarter (with the exception of courses that have not yet met). AW - Administrative WithdrawalIP - In Progress - for clinic shifts, preceptor- ships, clinic entry, theses, didactic courses and internships N - No GradeCE - Challenge ExaminationNS - No ShowAU - AuditWV - Waived ACHIEVED COMPETENCY (AC): A grade of AC indicates the student has gained the dened knowledge, information, skills and core competen- cies and has met the learning objectives as dened in the syllabi. Students must attain a level of achieved competency (AC) in all courses, clinic shifts and internships. AC grades are not factored into the GPA. PARTIAL COMPETENCY (PC): A grade of PC indicates that an aspect of the learning objectives or core competencies has not been achieved and there is need for further study to earn the required AC. Faculty determine the date by which a PC grade must be converted; however, PC grades must be converted no later than the end of the break of the subsequent quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete a PC contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's ofce. Grades of PC that have not been converted to AC grades by the deadline revert to F grades. The course, lab, clinic shift or internship must then be repeated. PC grades do not translate into partial credit on transcripts and are not factored into the GPA. FAILURE (F): A grade of F indicates failure to meet the minimum level of competency for learn- ing objectives or core competencies. A student who receives a failure in a required course, lab, clinic shift or internship must repeat that course, lab, clinic shift or internship. INCOMPLETE (I): A student who is doing satisfactory work in a course but cannot complete the work because of a serious illness or personal emergency may receive an Incomplete grade by ling a request for incomplete grade form with the registrar. Faculty determine the date by which an I grade must be converted; however, I grades must G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ A CADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES18 be converted no later than the end of the break subsequent to the quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete an I grade contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's ofce. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL (AW): A student who is suffering from a serious illness or experiencing a personal emergency and is unable to withdraw from term-based classes within the appropriate time frame may be awarded an AW grade by the registrar. The AW grade is awarded for all incomplete courses in a given quarter. (See \"Administrative Withdrawal\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information.) IN PROGRESS (IP): IP grades are indicated for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, clinic preparation, theses, internships, and clinic entry courses in which work may extend beyond the end of a quarter. If not converted to a passing grade, IP grades may be converted to an F grade. NO GRADE (N): N grades are assigned to indicate that a student is awarded no credit for a course but did not fail that course. N grades are administrative grades and are assigned only by the registrar. N grades are not refundable. CHALLENGE EXAMINATION (CE): Please see \"Challenge Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. NO SHOW (NS): NS grades are assigned to in- dicate that a student did not attend class. NS grades are not refundable, and no credit is given. AUDIT (AU): Students generally audit a course for their personal enrichment. No credit is given, and no academic grade granted. Courses taken for audit cannot serve as a prerequisite for a subsequent course. WAIVED (WV): Courses are generally waived if a student has demonstrated competency in a particular subject matter but does not have the appropriate level of coursework from an accredited institution to allow a transfer of credit. There is no credit attached to a waived course, and a student is required to make up the corresponding credits waived with additional elective credits. Undergraduate Degree Programs For the undergraduate degree programs, a student must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA in order to remain in good standing. Undergraduate students in the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine must maintain a 2.5 GPA in their rst year and a 3.0 GPA in their second year. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. The letter grading system for acupuncture and Oriental medicine*, nutrition, exercise science, herbal sciences and health psychology undergradu-ate programs is as follows: A - 95 percent-100 percent or 4.0A- - 90 percent-94.9 percent or 3.7B+ - 87 percent-89.9 percent or 3.3B - 83 percent-86.9 percent or 3.0B- - 80 percent-82.9 percent or 2.7C+ - 77 percent-79.9 percent or 2.3C - 73 percent-76.9 percent or 2.0C-* - 70 percent-72.9 percent or 1.7D+* - 67 percent-69.9 percent or 1.3D* - 63 percent-66.9 percent or 1.0D-* - 60 percent-62.9 percent or 0.7F - Below 60 percent or 0.0 AC - Achieved Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, outreach and practical courses PC - Partial Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, outreach, and practical courses I - Incomplete - personal emergency or seri- ous illness W - Withdrawn -Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and led in the reg- istrar's ofce at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter.

G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ A CADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES19 Graduate , MSN/DPD) The grading system used for graduate degree programs is identical to the undergraduate system, as shown above, except for the following: There is no grade of D+, D or D- for a graduate student, and the IP grade applies also to ongoing work on a thesis. For an explanation of grading terms, see the listing under the professional degree programs. For the graduate degree programs, a student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. Grade Change Policy The grades of PC, IP and I are considered tem- porary grades and designed to be changed (see \"Grading Policy\" in the Academic Policy and Pro- cedure Manual ). The grades of AC, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- and F are considered permanent grades and can only be changed if a faculty error was made at the time of issuance. The faculty member must submit documentation dem- onstrating the error to the registrar. Students are not allowed to submit additional work after the quarter has ended with the intent to raise an A- through F grade. The option of \"extra credit\" work must be written into the syllabus and collected prior to quarter's end. F or PC in Sequential Courses If a student has an F grade, or a PC that converts to an F grade, in a sequence course, the student will not be allowed to continue study in the next sequential course. If a PC grade is not remediated by 5 p.m. on the Friday at the end of the second week of the quarter, the student will be withdrawn from the course. I NDEPENDENT STUDY POLICY Independent study allows individual students to study areas of interest not included in the regular curriculum with the aid of an instructor or a selected resource person. Registration forms for independent study are available from the Ofce of the Registrar. The deadlines for registration, payment and grading of independent study courses are the same as those for regularly scheduled courses. Required courses may not be taken by independent study. Students may take an independent study course only if they are in good academic standing. ND students may request to do an independent study after they have completed at least 50 credits of their degree program. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine and nutrition students must have com- pleted at least 30 credits of their degree program. Psychology students must have completed at least 45 credits of their degree program. Students may apply a maximum of ve (5) credits of independent study toward the completion of their degree program. Students pursuing two majors as an undergraduate may apply a maximum of ten (10) credits by inde- pendent study, ve (5) toward each program. T RANSFER , W AIVER AND SUBSTITUTION POLICY Requests for transfer or waiver of credit must be submitted and reviewed within 12 months of a student's matriculation date or before the quarter in which the student is required to complete the course, whichever comes rst. Courses taken prior to entry at Bastyr can only be transferred to Bastyr during a student's rst year of attendance. After the rst year, previous courses taken can only be considered for waiver of required Bastyr courses, and elective credits must be taken to make up the waived credit. If this timeline is not followed and a course is waived/transferred after the start of the quarter in which a student is registered for that course, the standard course refund policy will apply. The courses under consideration for waiver or trans- fer should generally be no older than seven years. Waivers and transfer credit will not be awarded for courses submitted for transfer after the quarter in which the student is expected to take the course at Bastyr University. If an enrolled student wishes to complete a program requirement at another institution with the intent to transfer or waive the course at Bastyr, the student must request approval in advance by submitting a petition to waive, substitute or transfer credits along with the course description from the other institution. Courses submitted for transfer that have not received prior approval are not guaranteed transferability. TRANSFER T ransfer credit recognizes coursework from another accredited institution as satisfying a Bastyr required course. T ransfer credit grants credit for the Bastyr course and eliminates the need for the student to take that course. A petition to transfer may be requested by students who, at another accredited institution of higher education, have satisfactorily G ENERAL INFORMATION ~ A CADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES20 completed coursework that is the same in terms of content, level and credit as a specic Bastyr course, and meets or exceeds the academic objectives and competencies of a required course in Bastyr's pro- grams. T ransfer credit will generally not be granted for classes that are part of another earned degree or for classes that are taught at a different academic level. For courses taken prior to matriculation into Bastyr, transfer credit can only be granted within the rst year of attendance. T ransfer credit may be granted from institutions that are accredited by regional accrediting agencies recognized by the American Council on Education Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and from institutions that are profes- sionally accredited by the CNME, ACAOM and MEAC. Students who apply to Bastyr University with credit from institutions outside the U.S. are required to have international transcripts evaluated by an independent evaluation service. The evalua- tion report must be issued by an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) ac- credited evaluation service. Credits from schools outside the U.S. are evaluated according to nation- ally established norms. W AIVER A waiver does not grant credit; it only eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. Students are required to complete the equivalent number of credits approved via the waiver with elective credits. A petition to waive may be requested when formal train- ing, coursework or experience has been earned at an accredited or unaccredited institution. A student must provide documentation showing that the competen- cies of the Bastyr University course have been met. In some cases a competency or challenge exam may be required before the waiver will be granted. The waiver decision rests with the chair of the department responsible for teaching the curriculum. Appeals may be made to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled, whose decision is nal. SUBSTITUTION In some cases, students may request to sub- stitute one Bastyr University course for another Bastyr course if the courses are the same in terms of content, level and credit and meet or exceed the academic objectives and competencies of the required course. Substitution both grants credits and eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. For additional information regarding transfer, waiver or substitution of credit, please contact the advising/evaluations unit in the registrar's ofce. Also see \"T ransfer of Credit to Bastyr University\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual at MyBU for further details. D IVERSITY AWARENESS IN ACADEMICS Bastyr University is dedicated to the welfare of its students and patients as well as to promoting equal opportunity and access in education and health care. The University pledges its commitment to recogniz- ing and responding to multicultural and minority health care perspectives in all academic programs, clinical training and patient services, including curriculum development, course content, and supervision. Specically, wherever appropriate and feasible, the University considers and implements health care information and therapeutics pertaining to differences in age, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identication or expression, socioeconomic level, disability and physical/mental challenge. W HERE TO FIND OTHER ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The complete Academic Policy and Procedure Manual is located on MyBU. Student clinicians are also held to the policies found in the student clinician handbooks applicable to their specific program(s).
