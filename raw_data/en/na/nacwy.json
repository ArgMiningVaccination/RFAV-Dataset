These 4 domains (Energy, Mind-Body, Mechanics and Biology) were placed around a central health system of allopathy, or western medicine. What is Integrative Medicine? Through Integrate Columbus, we work within an expanded 6-Domain model, drawing attention to the importance of knowledge and awareness. Integrative Medicine, most simply, is a conscious effort toward distributing wellness efforts/resource in a balanced way across these six domains: Knowledge, Beliefs, Biology, Mechanics, Mind-Body and Energy. People often 'cluster' care into a few select domains while nearly or completely neglecting others. Working within this 6-domain model allows for the balancing of resources (time, finances, energy, etc.) while still providing comprehensive support and an honest framework for addressing concerns and goals in an integrated, sustainable way.
