Though recognition of special spots on the body is common to both, the aim of approach of each one is thoroughly opposite of the other. While Ayurveda describes the 'Marma' as seats of prana... the descriptions are mainly intended to warn the surgeon not to cause injury [where as] Acupuncture... spots are considered centers of 'vital energy' that when stimulated by sharp needles... brings about cure of many diseases. Nowhere in Ayurvedic texts is there any suggestion of meddling with the Marma for either relief of pain or for cure of diseases\" (Murthy, 115). Whether marma were classically used for healing or not, it is nonetheless now commonly used as such in Ayurvedic clinics and schools around the world. Locations, |Apanga||Outer between big toe and second toe||\u00bd angula||4| angula||4| |Kurchashira||Base of thumb joint and base of big toe joint||1 angula||4| |Lohitaksha||Lower frontal end of shoulder Immediately causing death - The marma of this type are Shringataka (four points), Adhipati (one point), Shankha (two points), Kanthasira/ matrika (eight points), Guda (one point), Hrdaya (one point), Basti (one point), Kshipra (four points), and Nabhi (one point). According to Sushruta, Sadya Pranahara points have the qualities of fire, and this is why they quickly cause death. Some classical physicians said that Sadya Pranahara points are those containing all five tissue types (Mamsa, Sira, Snayu, Asthi, and Sandhi). Sushruta disagrees and says that all five tissue types are present in the below four types of marma. - Kalantara Pranahara: Causing death after some time - Kalantara Pranahara have the qualities of water and fire, thus with their hot/fiery qualities kill debilitated people quickly, and with their cold/watery qualities kill others after some time. Sushruta designates the following marma as Kalantara Pranahara: (two points), (two points), Apastamba (two points), Simanta (five points), Tala (four points), Indrabasti (four points), Katika Taruna (two points), Brihati (two points), and Nitamba (two points). - Visalya Pranahara: Fatal if pierced - Visalya Pranahara points have the quality of air, thus are fatal if the air residing in the marma is disturbed. If pierced, the air will remain undisturbed if the foreign object is not removed, but upon removal of the foreign object air will be allowed to escape from the marma and thus cause death. Marma of this type are Utkshepa (two points) and Sthapani (one point). - Vaikalyakara: Disability causing - Sushruta describes Vaikalyakara marma as \"possessing qualities of the moon/water\" and explains that the corresponding stable and cold qualities help with the sustenance of life when these points are injured. Thus, only disability is caused. Points of Vaikalyakara nature are Lohitaksha (four points), Ani (four points), Janu (two points), Urvi (four points), Kurcha (four points), Vitapa (two points), Kupara (two points), Kukundara (two points), Kakshadhara (two points), Vidhura (two points), Krikatika (two points), Amsa (two points), Amsaphalaka (two points), Apanga (two points), Nila (two points), Manya (two points), Phana (two points), and Avarta (two points). - Rujakara: Pain causing - o The final categorization of marma point is Rujakara, which designates points composed of the qualities of fire and air, which produce pain. These marma are Gulpha (two points), Manibandha (two points), and Kurcha Sira (four points). Relations to Ayurveda & through Marma Herbs Ayurveda uses a vast breadth of herbs and formulations for internal and external healing. The topical application of herbal medicated oils, pastes, and powders may be used to elicit a desired effect from a specific marma. Dr. Frawley recommends Guggul as the most well rounded herb for marma therapy, citing it's clearing properties and it's affinity for reducing pain and promoting the flow of energy. For healing of a specific condition an herbal formula with properties specifically targeted toward the desired result should be used. Oleation Most commonly used as part of the Abhyanga massage, the application of oils is deeply therapeutic most especially for conditions of Vata nature but can be therapeutic for imbalances of all doshas. Warm sesame oil is best for the treatment of Vata, and the essential oil of sandalwood, calamus, or cinnamon can be added. For pitta coconut or sunflower oils are best, potentially mixed with the essential oils of sandalwood or rose. For Kapha, oil is generally contraindicated however sesame and mustard oil mixed together with the essential oils of camphor, menthol, or wintergreen would be balancing.2 Pranic Healing involves transmitting energy from the healer to the client and can be accomplished by placing one's hands above the specific area of the body (or in this case the marma point) that is the target of the healing. In Ayurvedic terms marma points are part of the Majja dhatu, or nervous system, which is governed by prana. Pranic healing can assist in the harmonious interaction of prana vayu (the flow of cellular intelligence), sadhaka pitta (present especially in the gray matter of the brain) and tarpaka kapha (the white matter covering the brain), to promote greater healing in the physical, mental, and emotional bodies. When contemplating the manipulation of the emotions, energetic body, or physical points remote to a specific marma it is interesting to note the correlation with modern superstring theory which considers all particles to be made of \"infinitesimally small vibrating strings\"5 which are the foundation of all energy. - The oneness of mindbody and how it may be bundled as vibrating energy that is interconnected to everything else in the universe, is the basis of what may be called the \"Cosmic Connection\". Furthermore, vibrating bundles of energy (i.e., vibrating strings of mutual harmonic resonance that have coalesced to form an electromagnetic field operating at a given frequency \u2014 not unlike a frequency for a radio station, for instance) create fields of influence around their physical selves. A physical manifestation of the energy of thoughts is the instincts and/or emotions as they elicit as a response to a specific stimulus.7 Yoga Asana Yoga is known to increase general pranic levels and also directly affects marma points through compression in certain poses.11 For example, Janu Sirsasana (seated forehead to knee pose) compresses Nabhi, Janu, and Sthapani marma as the third eye connects with the knee, and the abdomen is contracted. Sirsasana (headstand) stimulates Adhipati through the connection of the crown chakra with the earth. Halasana (shoulder stand) affects Hrdaya, Nila, and Nabhi as the frontal plane of the body is contracted and may also affect Brihati and Krikatika on the posterior plane. With a thorough knowledge of marma points and yoga postures, a great variety of therapeutic applications may be derived. Meditation Healing may be brought on by meditation upon a specific marma point, or set of points, to promote the free flow of prana independently of a therapist. Simply concentrating one's energy on the specific point(s), or by following the flow of energy within the body to or from a specific point, or by performing a complete rotation of consciousness around all the marma points of the body, awareness and healing may be achieved.
