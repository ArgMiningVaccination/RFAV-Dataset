I thought that the program did a fair job of representing both sides of the story, but I think that it failed to mention (or emphasize) some key points. There are many alternative therapies available. Unfortunately, as the program mentioned, some are not validated and could be classified as \"snake oil\". But on the flip side, there are practioners who went through rigorous schooling and are practicing as licensed physicians in many states. Your program failed to mention one of the most well-educated, best-supported group of alternative medicine practioners- Naturopathic Physicians (or NDs). These practioners undergo at least 4 years of rigorous medical school where they are taught the basic sciences, conventional medicine, and naturopathic medicine. They must pass state licensing exams and practice as physicians in many states. They are even covered by insurance in some states to be Primary Care Providers. I was very suprised that not one ND was interviewed in the documentary, and even more surprised that their existance was not acknowledged. Secondly, to mention the dangers of natural medicine without mentioning the much greater levels of injury or death from conventional medical treatments is irresponsible reporting. Half of all hospital admissions are due to the effect of a conventional medical intervention (drugs, surgical interventions, etc). Natural medicine is by nature less invasive and less drastic. Just listen to any commercial for a pharmaceutical drug to hear of the possible side effects! Lastly, there is no need to make a choice between one and medicine and the other. What I, and most of my collegues desire is to create a health care system where alternative therapies can be researched effectively and can be embraced. I hope to work alongside MDs and be able to refer my patients to them when necessary. Thank you for bringing this subject to light and stimulating discussion. Jaclyn Chasse Jaclyn Chasse Kenmore, Wa Dear FRONTLINE, I had been looking forward to this report for weeks, but was very disappointed that it focused mainly on obscure therapies and completely ignored more prominent practices including aromatherapy, meditation, massage therapies, nutritional therapies, and mind-body work such as visualization or hypnosis. Your program seemed to set Alternative therapies up for a fall. The Gonzalez Method is highly controversial even in the \"Alternative network,\" and claiming that the entire Alternative community is money hungry simply because suppliment industries have exploded hits below the belt...aren't conventional establishments incorporating alternative practices primarily to secure patients(as you stated), or in other words to secure their monetary flow? Furthermore, for those who insist on the \"scientific impossibility\" of homeopathy, I suggest you look up Jacques Benveniste. This French immunologist stumbled upon an astounding reaction of a solution of anti-IgE diluted 10^120 times with a solution of IgE. To clarify, the solution of anti-IgE was diluted until it was mathematically proven to contain only water, however, when combined with IgE the reaction occured as if anti-IgE were still present in the solution. This expirement was repeated several times in Israel, Canada, and Italy. The results of this study were published in the June 1998 issue of the prestigious British journal \"Nature.\" Counter intuitive, yes; impossible, no. Life is not black and white. Just because something is not scientifically proven does not mean that it is not effective. Energy is an acknowledged part of our world but is not thoroughly understood; perhaps our double-blinded paradigm is blinding us to the truth.

Jackie Vachon Greeley, Colorado Dear FRONTLINE, I found your show interesting and better then I thought it would be. I felt you gave an even hand to both sides. I have used alternative medicine for over 25 years for my family as well as myself with no side effects only positive results or, on occasion no results. I have worked in the insurance field for over 17 years and have spoken to thousands of people in many occupations including medicine, as time goes on I see more and more going alternative. When they say it should be rigorously tested vitamins, herbs, homeopathy, the ones who demand that know the expense to undertake that is prohibitively expensive, They can not be patented as a pharmaceutical drug can where the manufacturer who undertakes that expense cannot reap the financial benefits of having an exclusive patent. When they say it is dangerous, how many people died from a vitamin or herbal overdose or interaction among them? How many have died taking perscription drugs and there interactions a year more then in many wars. When they say \"proven\" many drug companies run their own tests before submitting it for release and had to be called back for serious side effects including, death. I did't believe in homeopathy till I had seen it work and knowing somewhat about medicine it wasn't a \"spontaneous recovery\". When they can't find any part of the original tincture after many dilutions is it possible we cannot see as of yet what we are looking at and that our body is able to see what we cannot and uses it as a, lets say a vaccine. If we are passive in our beliefs on alternative medicine it will not be allowed meaning, you will need a prescription for above RDA doses if they are allowed to pass \"CODEX ALIMENTARIUS\" which would set international standards on dietary supplements which it would be detrimental for the economy as well as our health. an Fintz Stan Fintz hicksville, New York | | FRONTLINE's editors respond: FRONTLINE's program next week examines the FDA and FDA approved drugs that don't work or cause harm. This program, \"Dangerous Prescription,\" airs on PBS/FRONTLINE November 13. Dear FRONTLINE, Your biased 'propaganda show' was predictable. It was over-loaded with allopathic MDs chattering nonsensically while pointing the proverbial finger at the least harmful and least invasive. You'all need to remember that when they point one finger outward there are at least three others pointing back at themselves. When those FDA approved drugs are as safe as herbs and homeopathics a discussion of these issues could be held on equal footing. It is interesting that the examples depicted were of a few failures. With ALL of the success experiences that tens of thousands of wholistic healthcare practitioners experience every day it is no less than mind boggling that you couldn't find or document just TWO examples to balance the picture to the American public. As a primary health care provider, my patients experience real and immediate results, everyday, especially in myofascial pain syndromes. Over the past year I have cordially invited three well known university medical-research facilities regarding their research into carpal tunnel syndrome to work with me and see real hard evidence of what I have done in newly synergizing ancient techniques which would help them make quantum advances. As soon as they understood that these non invasive healing methods could resolve a very high percentage of CTS in 1 to 2 treatments (95%+)...they ran very fast in the opposite direction and cut off any further communication. CTS is a $24 Billion dollar per year 'big business' with 2 million sufferers which represents ONLY one of the all too many myofascial pain syndromes. Western medicine is frightened of the simple glaring economics. If these synergized methods could save this country only $12 billion dollars for CTS (representing only one myofascial pain syndrome) what would happen to the barbaric methods of unneccesary surgical intervention, medications and ancillary services such as physical therapy to recover from the surgery? Of course our fellow humans would not suffer but why should the establishment be concerned about them? Speakers addressed the money (some $48 billion) that is being made from the alternative healthcare industry. Why not compare those figures to the several trillion of dollars made by the allopathic paradigm. Let's get real with comparisons. The battle between wholistic/natural medicine and allopathic medicine is long from being over, as one of the speakers misinformed Americans. That battle is just heating up!! Richard Freiberg, OMD, NMD Pompano Beach, Florida Dear FRONTLINE, While your program certainly pointed out the influence of large nutritional supplement companies and the impact of money and propaganda on that side of the issue, I don't believe you adequately portrayed the other side of this issue which is the even larger pharmaceutical lobby. I have seen rumors of false studies being circulated by pharmaceutical companies to discredit alternative medicines. I agree that we need a clearinghouse to sort out all the research and evaluate it's validity. William Bradley Tempe, AZ Dear FRONTLINE, I am a five year survivor of stage 4, squamous cell carcinoma. At the outset I was given 6 - 18 months, WITH surgery and maximum radiation therapy. One natural compound is, I'm convinced, responsible for my continued existence. I have become a supporter and promoter of this herbal tea and have watched those who take it faithfully, as I do, survive. Those who I have introduced to it, but who failed to follow through, are largely gone or going. Your program disappointed me greatly, as it appeared to be a patronizing, condesending overview of the field of alternative medicine. In fact it smacked of BIG pharmaceutical backing! Colin Waddell Fort St John, British Columbia Dear FRONTLINE, I was very disappointed in this program. I was especially upset with a statement made in connection with homeopathy. The narrator claimed that several studies have shown its effectiveness. To my knowledge, this is not true. The homeopathic physician referred to a dilution of tarantula that had a strength of \"ten to the minus 400\". This is interesting in that, I believe, there are only about ten to the 40 atoms in the universe. Jay Goldfarb Anchorage, AK Dear FRONTLINE, I know from my own experience that alertnative medicine does work. In particular, I've used a lot of acupunture over the years. My general physician was from Taiwan and a certified for acupuncture. I laughed it off as some quackery, but I found out otherwise that it did work. During a soccer game in junior high school I landed very hard on my tailbone, severely pinching the nerve that branches down your legs (I forget the name of it). I was unable to walk as a result. The next morning I was literally carried into his office and he put 9 needles around my tailbone. 30 minutes later I walked out of his office. I couldn't walk fast, but I was albulatory. The healing process had been accelerated so quickly that I was at 100% by the following week. I continued to use it for sports injuries throughout school, and it did much more for me than any western medicine could ever have done. My sister was literally saved by acupunture. She went through very serious epileptic seizures as a child that the latest in \"modern western medicine\" couldn't handle. The medications couldn't control her and she was close to dying. In desparation, my mom called him up and he said that he could use acupunture to help her. This was 1982 or so, when performing Chinese medicine in a hospital was forbidden. He put some needles in her in a private room, and the seizures stopped one hour later. The doctors had no explanation why they stopped, nor any knowledge that acupuncture was used. She continued to use it for several more years as an alternative to the drugs typically given for epilspy. If it wasn't for acupunture, my sister wouldn't be alive today. That's all the proof that I need. Erik Burd Sunnyvale, California Dear FRONTLINE, While things did not work out for your \"infertile\" couple - I have two very close friends who in the same situation turned to alternative medicine- they gave up alcohol, ate only organic foods and took numerous dietary supplements to get their bodies fit to conceive. Whilst numerous IVF treatments had failed, they were pregnant within 2 months of their new diet and now they have two healthy happy sons, aged 4 and 1 - no IVF needed, but a strenuous commitment to a dietary regime. I have no idea if it was the diet, or whether it was the hope - and that seemed to me to be the message of your programme. David Gilmore Dear FRONTLINE, Great show. I think if you duplicated this show, only focusing on chemo therapy and asking all the same questions about proof, effectiveness, etc you would be amazed at how close it would be. Its my understanding that Chemotherapy has never been proved to work. Why isn't that called \"alternative\"? Sincerely, Shelby Coelman Shelby Coleman New York, New York Dear FRONTLINE, As a practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine, I must say your presentation failed to do justice to the oldest, profesional,continually precticed, literate medicine in the world. This complete medical system's written literature stretches back almost 2,500 years. Acupuncture is just one of the many modalities used in Chinese Medicine. Over 1/4 of the world population uses it. How many more billions of people are needed to back scientific research? Over 2,500 years of proven results and over 40,000 books writen on Chinese Medicine sound like \"proven\" results to the thousands of practitioners of Chinese Medicine all over the world. A word regarding Ma Huang (ephedra). The actions and indications of Herba Ephedrae in the Chinese Medicine Materia are very specific to induce perspiration, promote urination and reduce edema. It should not be used for too long periods at the time, or in large doses, since the heavy sweating will definitely harm the body. There is a tremendous qualitative difference between waltzing into the corner store and buying Ephedra for weight loss, and designing an integrative approach to healing with the guidance of a Licenced, Master in Chinese Herbology. Simply because there is a market for natural supplements, it is a gross exaggeration to present Alternative practitioners as money-grubbing frauds. Mary Ellen Bestani, Lic Ac Arlington, Tx Dear FRONTLINE, How can science differentiate between a modality that simply facilitates the bodies own natural ability to heal itself and a placebo? The word placebo is thrown around in a way to dismiss the power of many alternative forms of healing. Some forms of alternative healing like acupuncture and hypnotherapy work with the bodies own innate ability to heal itself, and so are not introducing any thing that could be tested in a double blind clinical trial. It is difficult to imagine creating a study with placebo hypnosis for example. It seems to me that such modalities are doomed to be classified as only placebo by allopathic medicine regardless of their results in peoples lives. And by doing so they can continue to denounce them as unscientific only so they can keep their monopoly. Chris Vedeler Albuquerque, NM Dear FRONTLINE, Since I was a small child I suffered from acute hay fever. This forced me to spend much of my time indoors in the summertime. Conventional medicines made me sleepy and were only partially effecctive. When I was in my fifties, I consulted a homeopathic doctor in Seattle and after a 24 hour period of increased symptoms due to the medication, I found the hay fever was greatly reduced. Today, I am 69 and have almost no hay fever. Homeopathic medicine cured me! Arnold Nance Los Alamos, New Mexico Dear FRONTLINE, I was dismayed at the limited scope of this presentation on Alt Med by a Frontline that usually produced excellent programs. I was struck by the fact that the majority (I think 5) of the \"talking head\" experts presented were (markedly) critical of alternative medicine while only 2, Andrew Weil and the herbalist, were proponents. On the topic of FDA testing to assure safety, please remember that no less than an average 100,000 people die EACH YEAR due to FDA approved, prescribed medications taken in the manner in which they are prescribed. And every year sees at least one medication pulled from the market and several that have warnings added because the \"vigorous FDA testing\" did not uncover all the potential dangers of a drug, including death, until it had been given to a larger population. I am afraid we have come to rely on an interpretation of \"science\", that has remained unquestioned and stiffles curiosity. We doctors have a hard time acknowleging that the the nature of healing may be much more complex and mysterious than we would like to think. N. Haik, MD "}
