BIODIVERSITY IS THE KEY TO MANAGING ENVIRONMENT An ecosystem that retains a high biodiversity (that is, a wide variety of living things) is much more likely to adapt to human-caused environment change than is one that has little. Consider the two food webs shown in the diagram. The arrows point from the organism that gets eaten to the one that eats it. These food webs are highly 5 simplified compared with food webs in real ecosystems, but they still illustrate a key difference between more diverse and less diverse ecosystems. Food web B represents a situation with very low biodiversity, where at some levels the food path involves only a single type of organism. Food web A represents a more diverse ecosystem with, as a result, many more alternative feeding pathways. 10 Generally, loss of biodiversity s hould be regarded seriously, not only because the organisms that have become extinct represent a big loss for both ethical and utilitarian (useful benefit) reasons, but also because the organisms that remain have become more vulnerable (exposed) to extinction in the future.

Without any doubt, if there had been elections for the animal of the year 1997, Dolly would have been the winner! Dolly is a Scottish sheep that you see in the photo. But Dolly is not just a simple sheep. 5 She is a clone of another sheep. A clone means: a copy. Cloning means copying 'from a single master copy'. Scientists succeeded in creating a sheep (Dolly) that is identical to a sheep that functioned as a 10 'master copy'. It was the Scottish scientist Ian Wilmut who designed the 'copying machine' for sheep. He took a very small piece from the udder of an adult sheep (sheep 1). 15 From that small piece he removed the nucleus, then he transferred the nucleus into the egg-cell of another (female) sheep (sheep 2). But first he removed from that egg-cell all the material that would have 20 determined sheep 2 characteristics in a lamb produced from that egg-cell. Ian Wilmut implanted the manipulated egg-cell of sheep 2 into yet another (female) sheep (sheep 3). Sheep 3 became pregnant 25 and had a lamb: Dolly. Some scientists think that within a few years it will be possible to clone people as well. But many governments have already decided to forbid cloning of people by law. 30 ReleasedPISAItems_Science.doc Page 9 Question 1: CLONING S128Q01 Which sheep is Dolly identical to?

Next week I will take up a position as \"Herr Doktor\" at the First Ward of the maternity clinic of the Vienna General Hospital. I was frightened when I heard about the percentage of patients who die in this clinic. This month not less than 36 of the 208 mothers died there, all from puerperal fever. Giving birth to a child is as dangerous as first-degree pneumonia.' These lines from the diary of Ignaz Semmelweis (1818-1865) illustrate the devastating effects of puerperal fever, a contagious disease that killed many women after childbirth. Semmelweis collected data about the number of deaths from puerperal fever in both the First and the Second Wards (see diagram). Physicians, among them Semmelweis, were completely in the dark about the cause of puerperal fever. Semmelweis' diary again: 'December 1846. Why do so many women die from this fever after giving birth without any problems? For centuries science has told us that it is an invisible epidemic that kills mothers. Causes may be changes in the air or some extraterrestrial influence or a movement of the earth itself, an earthquake.' Nowadays not many people would consi der extraterrestrial influence or an earthquake as possible causes of fever. But in the time Semmelweis lived, many people, even scientists, did! We now know it has to do with hygienic conditions. Semmelweis knew that it was unlikely that fever could be caused by extraterrestrial influence or an earthquake. He pointed at the data he collected (see diagram) and used this to try to persuade his colleagues. Diagram 1841 1842 1843 1844 1845 1846 Year15 10 5Number of Deaths First Ward Second Ward Number of Deaths per 100 deliveries from puerperal fever ReleasedPISAItems_Science.doc Page 17 Question 2: SEMMELWEIS' DIARY S195Q02- 01 02 03 04 11 12 13 21 99 Suppose you were Semmelweis. Give a reason (based on the data Semmelweis collected) why puerperal fever is unlikely to be conclusions Theme: Human biology Area: Science in life and health Full credit Code 21: Refers to the difference between the number of deaths (per 100 deliveries) in both wards. Due to the fact that the first ward had a high rate of women dying compared to women in the second ward, obviously sh ows that it had nothing to do with earthquakes. Not as many people died in ward 2 so an earthquake couldn't have occurred without causing the same number of deaths in each ward. Because the second ward isn't as high, maybe it had something to do with ward 1. It is unlikely that earthquakes cause the fever since death rates are so different for the two wards. Partial credit Code 11: Refers to the fact that earthquakes don't occur frequently. It would be unlikely to be caused by ear thquakes because earthquakes wouldn't happen all the time. Code 12: Refers to the fact that earthquakes also influence people outside the wards. If there were an earthquake, women from outside the hospital would have got puerperal fever as well. If an earthquake were the reason, the whole world would get puerperal fever each time an earthquake occurs (not only the wards 1 and 2). Code 13: Refers to the thought that when earthquakes occur, men don't get puerperal fever. If a man were in the hospital and an earthquake came, he didn't get puerperal fever, so earthquakes cannot be the cause. Because girls get it and not men. No credit Code 01: States (only) that earthquakes cannot cause the fever. ReleasedPISAItems_Science.doc Page 18 An earthquake cannot influence a person or make him sick. A little shaking cannot be dangerous. Code 02: States (only) that the fever must have another cause (right or wrong). Earthquakes do not let out poison gases. They are caused by the plates of the Earth folding and faulting into each other. Because they have nothing to do with each other and it is just superstition. An earthquake doesn't have any influence on the pregnancy. The reason was that the doctors were not specialised enough. Code 03: Answers that are combinations of Codes 01 and 02. Puerperal fever is unlikely to be caused by earthquakes as many women die after giving birth without any problems. Science has told us that it is an invisible epidemic that kills mothers. The death is caused by bacteria and the earthquakes cannot influence them. Code 04: Other responses. I think it was a big earthquake that shook a lot. In 1843 the deaths decreased at ward 1 and less so at ward 2. Because there aren't any earthquakes by the wards and they still got it. [Note: The assumption that there were no earthquakes at that time isn't correct.] Code 99: Missing. ReleasedPISAItems_Science.doc Page 19 Semmelweis' Diary Text 2 Part of the research in the hospital was dissection. The body of a deceased person was cut open to find a cause of death. Semmelweis recorded that the students working on the First ward usually took part in dissections on women who died the previous day, before they examined women who had just given birth. They did not pay much attention to cleaning themselves after the dissections. Some were even proud of the fact that you could tell by their smell that they had been working in the mortuary, as this showed how industrious they were! One of Semmelweis' friends died after having cut himself during such a dissection. Dissection of his body showed he had the same symptoms as mothers who died from puerperal fever. This gave Semmelweis a new idea. Question 4: SEMMELWEIS' DIARY S195Q04 Semmelweis' new idea had to do with the high percentage of women dying in the maternity wards and the students' behaviour. What was this idea? A Having students clean themselves after di ssections should lead to a decrease of puerperal fever. B Students should not take part in dissections because they may cut themselves. C Students smell because they do not clean themselves after a dissection. D Students want to show that they are industrious, which makes them careless when they examine the women.

WHAT HUMAN ACTIVITIES CONTRI BUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE? The burning of coal, oil and natural gas, as well as deforestation and various agricultural and industrial practices, are altering the composition of the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. These human activities have led to increased concentrations of particles and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The relative importance of the main contributors to temperature change is shown in Figure 1. Increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane have a heating effect. Increased concentrations of particles have a cooling effect in two ways, labelled 'Particles' and 'Particle effects on clouds'. Figure 1: Relative importance of the main contributors to change in temperature of the atmosphere. Bars extending to the right of the centre line indicate a heating effect. Bars extending to the left of the centre line indicate a cooling effect. The relative effect of 'Particles' and 'Particle effects on clouds' are quite uncertain: in each case the possible effect is somewhere in the range shown by the light grey bar.

FLIES A farmer was working with dairy cattle at an agricultural experiment station. The population of flies in the barn where the cattle lived was so large that the animals' health was affected. So the farmer sprayed the barn and the cattle with a solution of insecticide A. The insecticide killed nearly all the flies. Some time later, however, the number of flies was again large. The farmer again sprayed with the insecticide. The result was similar to that of the first spraying. Most, but not all, of the flies were killed. Again, within a short time the population of flies increased, and they were again sprayed with the insecticide. This sequence of events was repeated five times: then it became apparent that insecticide A was becoming less and less effective in killing the flies. The farmer noted that one large batch of the insecticide solution had been made and used in all the sprayings. Therefore he suggested the possibility that the insecticide solution decomposed with age .

In February 1993 a research team of the National Institute for Agricultural Research in Bresson-Villiers (France) succeeded in producing five clones of calves. The production of the clones (animals with the same genetic material, even though born of five different cows), was a complicated process. First the researchers removed about thirty egg cells from a cow (let us say the 5 cow's name was Blanche 1). The researchers removed the nucleus from each of the egg cells taken from Blanche 1. Then the researchers took an embryo from another cow (let us say Blanche 2). This embryo contained about thirty cells. The researchers separated the ball of cells from Blanche 2 into individual 10 cells. Then they removed the nucleus from each of these individual cells. Each nucleus was injected separately into each of the thirty cells that came from Blanche 1 (cells from which the nuclei had been removed). Finally the thirty injected egg cells were implanted into thirty surrogate cows. 15 Nine months later, five of the surrogate cows gave birth to the calf clones. One of the researchers said that a large scale application of this cloning technique could be financially beneficial for cattle breeders.

The atmosphere is an ocean of air and a precious natural resource for sustaining life on the Earth. Unfortunately, human activities based on national/personal interests are causing harm to this common resource, notably by depleting the fragile ozone layer, which acts as a protective shield for life on the Earth. Ozone molecules consist of three oxygen atoms, as opposed to oxygen molecules 5 which consist of two oxygen atoms. Ozone molecules are exceedingly rare: fewer than ten in every million molecules of air. However, for nearly a billion years, their presence in the atmosphere has played a vital role in safeguarding life on Earth. Depending on where it is located, ozone can either protect or harm life on Earth. The ozone in the troposphere (up to 10 kilometres above the Earth's surface) is \"bad\" 10 ozone which can damage lung tissues and plants. But about 90 percent of ozone found in the stratosphere (between 10 and 40 kilometres above the Earth's surface) is \"good\" ozone which plays a beneficial role by absorbing dangerous ultraviolet (UV- B) radiation from the Sun. Without this beneficial ozone layer, humans would be more susceptible to certain 15 diseases due to the increased incidence of ultra-violet rays from the Sun. In the last decades the amount of ozone has decreased. In 1974 it was hypothesised that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) could be a cause for this. Until 1987, scientific assessment of the cause-effect relations hip was not convincing enough to implicate CFCs. However, in September 1987, diplomats from around the world met in 20 Montreal (Canada) and agreed to set sharp limits to the use of CFCs.

In fact each day some ozone is formed and some other ozone disappears. The way ozone is formed is illustrated in the following comic strip. Suppose you have an uncle who tries to understand the meaning of this strip. However, he did not get any science education at school and he doesn't understand what the author of the strip is explaining. He knows that there are no little fellows in the atmosphere but he wonders what those little fellows in the strip stand for, what those strange notations O 2 and O 3 mean and which processes the strip represents. He asks you to explain the strip. Assume that your uncle knows: \u0083 that O is the symbol for oxygen; \u0083 what atoms and molecules are. Write an explanation of the comic strip for your uncle. In your explanation, use the words atoms and molecules in the way they are used in lines 5 and Communicating Theme: Chemical and physical changes Area: Science in Earth and environment Full credit Code 31: Gives an answer in which the following three aspects are mentioned: First aspect: an oxygen molecule or some oxygen molecules (each consisting of two oxygen atoms) are split into oxygen atoms (picture 1). ReleasedPISAItems_Science.doc Page 33 Second aspect: the splitting (of oxygen molecules) takes place under the influence of sunlight (picture 1). Third aspect: the oxygen atoms combine with other oxygen molecules to form ozone molecules (pictures 2 and 3). Remarks on each of the three aspects: First aspect: \u00be The splitting should be described using the correct words (see lines 5 and 6) for O (atom or atoms) and O 2 (molecule or molecules). \u00be If O and/or O 2 have been described only as \"particles\" or \"small parts\" no credit should be given for this aspect. Second aspect: \u00be The Sun's influence should be related to the splitting of O 2 (an oxygen molecule or oxygen molecules). \u00be If the Sun's influence is related to the forming of an ozone molecule from an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule (pictures 2 and 3) no credit should be given for this second aspect. Note: Aspects 1 and 2 may typically be given in the one sentence. Third aspect: \u00be This aspect should be given credit (one point) if the answer contains any description of an O combining with an O 2. If the formation of O 3 is described as combining of (three, separate) O atoms this third aspect should not be given credit. \u00be If O 3 is not described as a molecule or molecules but for example as \"a group of atoms\" this can be tolerated for the third aspect. Examples of Code 31: When the sun shines on the O 2 molecule the two atoms separate. The two O atoms look for other O 2 molecules to join with. When the O 1 and O 2 join they form O 3 which is ozone. The strip illustrates the formation of oz one. If an oxygen molecule is affected by the sun, it breaks into two separate at oms. These separate atoms, O, float around looking for a molecule to link up to; they line up to existing O 2 molecules and form an O 3 molecule, as three atoms are now joined together; O 3 forms Ozone. The little guys are O, or oxygen atom s. When two are joined they make O 2 or oxygen molecules. The Sun causes this to decompose into Oxygen again. The O 2 atoms then bond with an O 2 molecule creating O 3 which is ozone. [Note: The answer can be regarded as correct. There is only a slip of the pen (\"O 2 atoms\" after having mentioned \"oxygen atoms\" previously).] Partial credit Code 21: First and second aspects only correct. The sun decomposes the oxygen molecule s into single atoms. The atoms fuse into groups. The atoms form groups of 3 atoms together. ReleasedPISAItems_Science.doc Page 34 Code 22: First and third aspects only correct. Each of the little fellows stand for one atom of oxygen. O is one oxygen atom, O 2 is an oxygen molecule and O 3 is a group of atoms all joined together. The processes shown are one pair of oxygen atoms (O 2) getting split and then each joining with 2 other pairs forming two groups of 3 (O 3). The little fellows are oxygen atoms. O 2 means one oxygen molecule (like a pair of little fellows holding hands) and O 3 means three oxygen atoms. The two oxygen atoms of one pair break apart a nd one joins each of the other pairs and out of the three pairs, two sets of three oxygen molecules (O 3) are formed. Code 23: Second and third aspects only correct. The oxygen is broken up by the sun's radiation. It splits in half. The two sides go and join other oxygen \"particles\" forming ozone. Most of the time in pure oxygen (O 2) environments oxygen comes in pairs of 2 so there are 3 pairs of 2. 1 pair is ge tting too hot and they fly apart going into another pair making O 3 instead of O 2. [Note: Although \"one pair is getting too hot\" is not a very good description for the sun's influence, credit for the second aspect should be given; the third aspe ct can also be regarded as correct.] Code 11: First aspect only correct. Oxygen molecules are breaking down. They form O atoms. And sometimes there are ozone molecules. The ozone layer remains the same because new molecules are formed and others die. Code 12: Second aspect only correct. O represents an oxygen molecule, O 2 = oxygen, O 3 = ozone. Sometimes both oxygen molecules, joining each other, ar e separated by the sun. The single molecules join another pair and form ozone (O 3). Code 13: Third aspect only correct. The 'O' (oxygen) molecules are forced to bond with O 2 (2 x oxygen molecules) to form O 3 (3 x oxygen molecules) , by the heat of the Sun. [Note: The underlined part of the answer shows the third aspec t. No credit can be given for the second aspect, because the Sun is not involved in the formation of ozone from O + O 2 but only in breaking down bonds in O 2.] No credit Code 01: None of the three aspects correct. The sun (ultraviolet rays) burns the ozone layer and at the same time is destroying it as well. Those little men ar e the ozone layers and they run away from the sun because it is so hot. [Note: No point can be awarded, not even for mentioning something about the Sun's influence.] The sun is burning the ozone in the fi rst boxes. In the second boxes they are running away with tears in their eyes and in the third box they are cuddling each other with tears in their eyes. Well uncle Herb it's simple.

DUTCHMAN USES CORN AS FUEL Auke Ferwerda's stove contains a few logs burning quietly with low flames. From a paper bag next to the stove he takes a handful of corn and puts it onto the flames. Immediately the fire flares up brightly. \"Look here,\" Ferwerda says, \"The window of the stove stays clean and transparent. Combustion is complete.\" Ferwerda talks about the fact that corn can be used as fuel as well as cattle food. As far as he is concerned, this is the future. Ferwerda points out that corn, in the form of cattle food, is in fact a type of fuel too. Cows eat corn to get energy out of it. But, Ferwerda explains, the sale of corn for fuel instead of for cattle food might be much more profitable for farmers. Ferwerda has become convinced that, in the long run, corn will be widely used as fuel. He imagines what it will be like harvesting, storing, drying and packing the grains in bags for sale. Ferwerda is currently investigating whether the whole corn plant could be used as fuel, but this research has not been completed yet. What Ferwerda also needs to consider is the amount of attention being focused on carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is regarded as the main cause of the increase of the Greenhouse effect. The increase of the Greenhouse effect is said to be the cause of the increasing average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. In Ferwerda's view, however, there is nothing wrong with carbon dioxide. On the contrary, he argues, plants absorb it and convert it into oxygen for human beings. However, Ferwerda's plans may clash with those of the government, which is actually trying to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide. Ferwerda says, \"There are many scientists who say that carbon dioxide is not the main cause of the Greenhouse effect.\" ReleasedPISAItems_Science.doc Page 38 Question 2: CORN S307Q02 Ferwerda compares corn used as fuel to corn used as food.

During the breeding season the male st ickleback's belly turns from silver- coloured to red. The male stickleback will attack any co mpeting male that comes into his territory, and try to chase it away. If a silver-coloured female approaches, he will try to guide her to his nest so she will lay her eggs there. In an experiment a student wants to investigate what will make the male stickleback show aggressive behaviour. A male stickleback is alone in the student's aquarium. The student has made three wax models attached to pieces of wire. He hangs them separately in the aquarium for the same amount of time. Then the student counts the number of times the male stickleback reacts aggressively by pushing against the wax figure. The results of this experiment are shown below.

The structures in the picture are windmills with blades that are rotated by the wind. These rotations cause electricity to be produced by generators that are turned by the windmills. A wind farm Question 1: WIND FARMS S529Q01 The graphs below show the average wind speeds in four different places throughout a year.

However, there is not a direct relationship between wind speed and electric power in a real setting. Below are four working conditions of electricity generation in a real wind farm. The windmill blades start rotating when the wind speed reaches V 1. The electric power output reaches a maximum (W) when the wind speed is V 2. For safety reasons, the blades are prevented from rotating faster than they do when the wind speed is V 2. The blades stop rotating when the wind speed reaches V 3. Which one of the following graphs best represents the relationship between wind speed and electric power output under these working conditions?

A disadvantage .......................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................... .... WIND FARMS SCORING 4 Full credit Code 2: One specific advantage and one specific disadvantage are described. Scoring Comment: It is possible for the cost of wind farms to be seen as an advantage or disadvantage depending on what aspect is considered (e.g., establishment costs or running costs). Hence, mentioning \"the cost\" involved, without further explanation, is not sufficient to gain credit as either an advantage or a disadvantage. ReleasedPISAItems_Science.doc Page 93 [Advantage] Do not discharge carbon dioxide (CO 2). Do not consume fossil fuels. The wind resource will not be used up. After the wind generator is established, t he cost for electric generation is cheap. No waste and/or no toxic substance will be emitted. Using natural forces or clean energy. Environmentally friendly and will last for a very long time. [Disadvantage] Generation on demand is not possible. [Because the wind speed cannot be controlled.] Good places for windmills are limited. The windmill could be damaged by too strong wind. The amount of power generated by each windmill is relatively small. Noise pollution occurs in some cases. Birds are sometimes killed when they crash into the rotors. Natural views are altered [Visual pollution] . Expensive to set up Partial credit Code 1: Either a correct advantage or a correct disadvantage is described (as shown in the full credit examples) but not both No credit Code 0: No correct advantage or correct disadvantage is described. Individual examples of unacceptable advantages or disadvantages are given below. Good for the environment or nature. [This answer is a general value statement.] Bad for the environment or nature It costs less to build a wind power generator than to build a fossil fuel power plant. [This ignores the fact that a great number of wind power generators would be needed to produce the same amount of power as a fossil fuel power plant.] It wouldn't cost as much. Code 9: Missing.
