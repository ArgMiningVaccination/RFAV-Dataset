[Immunotherapy](https://www.ajmc.com/compendium/immuno-oncology) has changed the cancer treatment landscape significantly in recent years, with a small but significant portion of patients experiencing deep responses to treatment. A [review](https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-022-01335-y) published in Journal of Hematology & Oncology highlights tumor-resident myeloid cells as targets that may increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in nonresponders. Myeloid cells are innate immune cells, and include macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, monocytes, and imprinted by the tumor microenvironment (TME). They each have distinct roles, but generally serve as the first line of defense against pathogens and help repair tissue once pathogens are eradicated\u2014except when commandeered by tumor cells to aid tumor growth. Myeloid cells are complex with significant heterogeneity, making them a challenge to target with immunotherapy and effectively harness for cancer treatment. \"Despite over 40% of cancer patients being eligible to receive immunotherapy, only 12% of patients gain benefit,\" the authors wrote. \"A key to understanding what differentiates treatment response from nonresponse is better defining the role of the innate immune system in antitumor immunity and immune tolerance.\" The review highlights current strategies for myeloid cell targeting and ongoing trials of novel agents targeting myeloid cells for cancer treatment, including data from the 2021 China Cancer Immunotherapy Workshop in Beijing, an international meeting that included discussions of myeloid cell heterogeneity and function in the TME. Current strategies targeting myeloid cells in various stages of research and trials highlighted in the review include the following: The majority of therapies using the above methods are still in clinical trial phases, with all but polarization reaching phase 3 trials as of the review. The authors also highlight CAR-Ms as a mechanism they believe may overshadow CAR T cells\u2014a current focus of immunotherapy\u2014in the future. Understanding the various myeloid components and their impacts on the TME is crucial to maximizing the likelihood of therapy response, the authors note. Emerging targets for myeloid cell manipulation include Siglec-15, a sialic acid; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid with collagenous vascular endothelial receptor 1 (CLEVER-1). Although utilizing multiple agents targeting different myeloid components in tandem with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy is the most promising approach, toxicity is an important aspect to consider as these strategies are designed and tested. \"Key areas of continued research include further investigation into the cross talk among cancer cells, myeloid cells, adaptive immune cells, and surrounding cells, like epithelial cells and fibroblasts, to create tolerogenic environments, with the help of single-cell multi-omics technologies,\" the authors concluded. Overall, they are optimistic that the immunotherapy landscape will continue to expand and benefit more patients as the intricacies of non-T-cell-based immunotherapy are better understood.
