Date and time Location Singapore Expo1 Expo Drive Singapore, 486150 Singapore About this event SHBC is the flagship event of NHG and has firmly established itself as Singapore's leading healthcare congress and a highly anticipated annual event. The past 20 editions of SHBC saw over 3,000 local and overseas delegates yearly with varied backgrounds from healthcare professionals, scientists, administrators, community care partners to industry experts, researchers and students. SHBC2023 will be a fully physical congress to maximise audience engagement, interaction with experts and provide creative networking opportunities. The theme this year is 'Transforming for a Healthier Population'. Health and healthcare delivery have changed rapidly over the past years and this shift has ushered many complex layers and dimensions. As Singapore embarks on Healthier SG and NHG continues its work towards better health for our population, we envisage a need to unite the key pillars of the healthcare community and partner the population to play an active role to change behaviour and improve health.
