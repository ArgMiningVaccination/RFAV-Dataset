viii| The Millennium Development Goals for HealthixThe extent of premature death and ill health in the devel- oping world is staggering. In 2000 almost 11 million chil-dren died before their fth birthday, an estimated 140million children under ve are underweight, 3 million diedfrom HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis claimed another 2 millionlives, and 515,000 women died during pregnancy or childbirth in 1995, almost all of them in the developing world. Death and ill health on such a scale are matters of con- cern in their own right.They are also a brake on economicdevelopment. It was these twin concerns that led the inter-national community to put health rmly at the center ofthe Millennium Development Goals when adopting themat the Millennium Summit in September 2000. This report focuses on the health and nutrition Millennium Development Goals agreed to by over 180governments. It assesses progress to date and prospects ofachieving the goals.The report argues that where progresshas been slow, the reason is not lack of technical solutionsbut that effective interventions are not used.The reportreviews the determinants to low access and use of theseinterventions at household and health systems levels, andshows the role that policies and institutions play. The report argues that low coverage of MDG-related interventions reflects in part the low level of governmenthealth spending but more fundamentally the numerouspolicy and institutional weaknesses across the entire healthsystem. It shows that additional spending on health wouldaccelerate progress toward the MDGs in countries withgood policies and institutions, while progress in countrieswhere they are weak, requires a more targeted approach. Itrequires rst and foremost a focus on households\u2014not onlyas users of services but as producers of health\u2014and onproviders and their accountability. Accelerating progresstoward the MDGs in those contexts requires strengtheningof input markets, such as people and pharmaceuticals, andof core public health functions: monitoring, evaluation, sur-veillance, regulation, social mobilization, and concertedaction beyond the health sector. The report identies what developing country governments can do to accelerate the pace of progresswhile ensuring that benets accrue to the poorest andmost disadvantaged households. It also pulls together thelessons of development assistance and country initiativesand innovations to improve the effectiveness of aid, basedon a number of country case studies. It highlights some ofthe principles of effective development assistance: countrydriven coordination; strategic coherence expressed incomprehensive poverty reduction strategies, which fullyaddress the issues of health, nutrition, and population;nancial coherence embodied in medium term expendi-ture framework; pooling of donor funds; and a commonframework for reporting and assessing progress. A process has begun that we hope will lead to more coordinated donor actions to accelerate country levelprogress.This report aims to inform this process at theglobal level, resulting in actions to which the internationalcommunity is rmly committed. But more importantly,we hope that this report will stimulate and inform policydialogue and actions at national and sub-national levels,involving the many stakeholders\u2014households foremostamong them\u2014that are critical for achieving the healthand population MDGs. Ultimately, this report will haveserved its purpose if it generates action and change, and ifit contributes to accelerate the pace toward achieving theMDGs. Many lives are at stake.We know what needs to bedone. It is time to act.

It argues thatextra government health spending is not enough, and thatpolicies and institutions within and beyond the health sec-tor need to be strengthened if faster progress toward thehealth millennium development goals is to be made. Onthese and other issues the report reaches clear-cut conclu-sions.These are summarized below. Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals for health has been mixed. Some good news: nearly 80 percent of the world's peo- ple live in a country that is on track to hit the malnutri-tion target. In the 1990s, 38 percent of countriesaccelerated the rate of decline for under-ve mortalitydespite HIV/AIDS.And in two regions\u2014East Asia andPacic and the Middle East and North Africa\u2014mater-nal mortality appears to have fallen swiftly in the 1990s. But plenty of bad news, too. On under-ve mortality, progress has been much too slow\u2014and has beengetting even slower. Sub-Saharan Africa is laggingbehind badly across all the Millennium DevelopmentGoals for health but especially on under-ve mortality,for which no Sub-Saharan country is on track to hitthe target.All regions face challenges on at least someMillennium Development Goals, including regionswith many middle-income countries. Overall,however, the poorest countries are progressing theslowest. And at least for under-ve mortality, poorcommunities within countries are progressing theslowest. Progress in the second half of the 1990-2015 window will not necessarily be swifter. There will be some stimuli for faster progress outside the health sector. Economic growth is set to increase inall regions except East Asia and Pacic.TheMillennium Development Goal agenda may well speedup progress toward universal primary enrollment, theelimination of gender gaps in secondary education, andincreased access to safe drinking water. But even on themost optimistic calculations, the combined effects ofthese stimuli will be insufcient for most countries tomake the difference between hitting and missing theMillennium Development Targets. Developments within the health sector will tend to slow down progress. Many countries cannot sustain therate of increase of coverage of attended deliveries theysaw during the 1990s\u2014the inevitable slowdown willlead to a slower rate of decline for maternal mortality. Accelerating progress toward the Millennium Development Goals for health is possible in allregions and countries. Effective interventions exist for malnutrition, child mortality, maternal mortality, and communicablediseases. But they are being used too little by the peoplewho can benet from them\u2014especially poor people. Ifuniversal coverage rates were achieved for a handful ofkey child health interventions, the number of under-ve deaths worldwide would fall by nearly two-thirds\u2014the Millennium Development Target.A three-quartersreduction in the rate of maternal mortality\u2014theMillennium Development Target\u2014could be achievedby scaling up coverage rates of a handful of keymaternal mortality interventions, including improvedaccess to comprehensive essential obstetric care.Thetechnology is available\u2014it just needs to be used by all. Additional resources are required but will not be sufcient to reach the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. Increased government spending on health is a part of the answer to getting effective interventions used morewidely. But it is not the whole story. In countries withvery poor policies and institutions, across-the-boardincreases in government spending will have little if anyimpact on Millennium Development Indicators. Inthese countries, improved policies and institutions\u2014within and beyond the health sector\u2014are crucial ifprogress toward the Millennium Development Goals isto be accelerated. Even in countries with relativelygood policies and institutions, additional governmenthealth spending needs to be targeted. Preliminary esti-mates suggest the returns to targeted spending\u2014inreduced mortality\u2014are much higher than the returnsto across-the-board increases in government healthspending.KEY MESSAGES AND POLICY HIGHLIGHTSxii| The Millennium Development Goals for HealthStrengthening policies and institutions in the health sector requires working across severalinterrelated areas. Stronger policies and better institutions for health require lowering the nancial and nonnancial barriersthat households face in their dual roles as producers ofhealth and users of health services. Price is key,especially for the poor, but knowledge and geographicaccess are also important. Better policies and institutions within the health sector also entail improving the performance of healthproviders\u2014on their quality,their responsiveness,and theirefciency\u2014through greater accountability.Withinprovider organizations,stronger management involvesincreasing the accountability of frontline providers to theorganization.But their performance can also be improvedby making them more accountable to the public,whetheralong the direct route (for example,enabling communityorganizations to exercise oversight of providers) or theindirect route (making providers more accountable to pol-icymakers through,for example,contracts or agreements,and making policymakers in turn more accountable to thepublic through greater democracy and openness).Reaching the poor requires new thinking about the mosteffective service delivery for the different kinds of basicservices:outreach,xed facilities,and referral. Human resource challenges face most developing countries, and policymakers need to work along severaldimensions.Wages and monetary benets areimportant elements of recruitment and retentionefforts. But there are other avenues that can usefully beexplored, such as increasing training opportunities,enhancing promotion prospects, and so on. For medicines and essential supplies,governments have to ensure that medicines reach and are affordable for peoplewho need them most.Again,working along a variety ofdimensions is required,including improved logistics,butalso better incentives,more strategic procurementarrangements,and a more responsible role for industrialgovernments in making existing drugs available at afford-able prices and providing the appropriate incentive envi-ronment for research and development into diseases thatdisproportionately affect poor countries. Many governments lack credible and resource- backed strategies for the prevention, treatment, andcontrol of communicable diseases. T oo little effort is devoted to surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, learning the lessons of such exercises,and incorporating the lessons into policymaking.Andall too often intersectoral issues are poorly handled.Y et,as is becoming increasingly clear, investments outsidethe health sector (in water and sanitation, and roads andtransport) do not achieve their full impact on healthunless they are accompanied by well designed programsthat aim to change people's behavior (for example,hand-washing) or accessing services. Some countries appear to spend less than they can afford. In these countries, governments should consider raising the share of government spending in GDP , or increas-ing the health share of total government spending.Such reforms take time and may require technical andnancial assistance from donors. Governments needalso to play a stronger role in encouraging or arrangingthe pooling of out-of-pocket expenditures throughinsurance and prepayment mechanisms. Donors can do better than they have done in the past. Development assistance to health is too unpredictable, and the transaction costs are too high. Developmentassistance to health\u2014like government spending itself\u2014is more productive in countries with sound policiesand institutions. Aid can help foster good policies andfacilitate transition to them, but donors cannot forcepolicies on countries against their will.Aid is fungible,at least in part: this points toward enhancedcoordination, aid pooling, and putting countries in thedriver seat. Global partnerships in health add value, butcontain risks. At the High-Level Forum on the Millennium Development Goals for health in Geneva in January2004, there was broad agreement among a wide varietyof different actors\u2014donors, international technicalagencies, philanthropists, and developing countries\u2014on a number of points. It was agreed that theMillennium Development Goals for health pose formi-dable challenges and that it is vital for all to rise tothem.All agreed that a greater sense of urgency isrequired if 2015 is not to pass by with a large numberof countries having missed the targets.The forum par-ticipants agreed on actions in the mobilization ofresources for health, aid effectiveness andharmonization, human resources, and in the monitor-ing of performance.maternal mortality, 69 percent in East Asia and Pacic, 19 percent in Europe and Central Asia, 3 percent inSub-Saharan Africa, 2 percent in Latin America and theCaribbean, and 0 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even within a region the progress toward the Millennium Development Targets can varytremendously. Many countries in East Asia and Pacic reached the required annual rate of reduction to achieve the target ofhalving of malnutrition by 2015 in the 1990s, and theregion as a whole is on track to hit the target. But severalcountries have not achieved the required rate ofreduction.Why the Millennium Development Goals matter\u2014it's the world's poor who die earlier. Rates of mortality and malnutrition tend to be much higher among the world's poor and,with the exception of deathsfrom HIV/AIDS,lower among better-off sections of theworld's population. 41 percent of children in the poorest quarter of the world's population are underweight, 3 percent in therichest quarter. 114 deaths among children under ve per 1,000 live births for the poorest quarter, 13 per 1,000 for therichest quarter. 63 maternal deaths per 10,000 live births for the poor- est quarter, 4 per 10,000 for the richest quarter.ied across regions\u2014slowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, swiftestin the Middle East and North Africa. 60 percent of the people in the Middle East and North Africa are in countries on track to reach the goal forunder-ve mortality, 39 percent in Latin America andthe Caribbean, 28 percent in Europe and Central Asia,17 percent in East Asia and Pacic, 10 percent in SouthAsia, and 0 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. 84 percent of the people in the Middle East and North Africa are in countries on track to reach the goal forSTATISTICAL HIGHLIGHTS 164 AIDS deaths per 100,000 people for the poorest quarter, 31 for the richest quarter. Progress toward the Millennium Development Goal targets has varied\u2014across indicators and acrossregions. Progress has been fastest for malnutrition, reflecting in part the lower target for this indicator (a halving of the ratebetween 1990 and 2015, compared with a two-thirdsreduction in the case of maternal mortality).

Myanmar and Cambodia have been reducing malnutri- tion by only 1.1 percent a year, Lao PDR by 0.9percent, and the Philippines by 0.6 percent. In Mongolia malnutrition has been increasing by 1.1 percent a year. The poorest countries are progressing slowest toward the Millennium Development Goals. For malnutrition, under-ve mortality, and maternal mor- tality the story is the same\u2014the low-income countriesreduced their rates least quickly in the 1990s. Low-income countries have been reducing malnutrition by only 2.6 percent a year, lower middle-income countries by 7.6 percent, and upper middle-income countries by 4.6 percent. Low-income countries have been reducing under-ve mortality by 2.3 per cent a year,lower middle-income countries by 2.5 per cent,and upper middle-income countries by 4.9 per cent. Low-income countries have been reducing maternal mortality by 2.4 per cent a year,lower middle-income countries by 4.9 per cent,and upper middle-income countries 2.5 per cent.Most of the world lives in a country where under- ve mortality fell slower in the 1990s than it did inthe 1980s. Under-ve mortality typically fell slower during the 1990s than it did in the 1980s.

In 2000 more than 11 million children died before theirfth birthday. 1Among the world's 613 million children under ve, 140 million are underweight.1In 1998, 843 million people were classied as undernourished on thebasis of their food intake. In 2001, 3 million people diedfrom HIV/AIDS. 2, 3Tuberculosis claimed 2 million lives, and in 1995 half a million women died during pregnancyor childbirth. This heavy burden of death and suffering is heavily con- centrated in the world's poorest countries (gure 1). Just 1percent of the world's 11 million under-ve deathsoccurred in high-income countries, with 42 percent occur-ring in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Almost half the world'sunderweight children\u201465 million children\u2014live in SouthAsia. And 98 percent of the world's half million maternaldeaths took place in the developing world\u2014252,000 inSub-Saharan Africa alone. 1Within countries, too, it is the poor who shoulder the lion's share of the disease burden. Death and disease matter in their own right, but they also act as a brake on poverty reduction.As Nobel laureateAmartya Sen recently put it, \"health is among the mostimportant conditions of human life and a critically signi-cant constituent of human capabilities which we have rea-son to value.\" 4But health also matters because it affects living standards\u2014of households and countries. Healthexpenses can easily become burdensome for households:in Vietnam alone they are estimated to have pushed some3 million people into poverty in 1993. 5 Beyond its direct impact on a household's living stan- dards through out-of-pocket expenditures, ill health has anindirect effect on labor income, through productivity andthe number of hours people can spend working. Theeffects of illness on income may take time to appear andbe long lasting. If children are malnourished, they are lesslikely to be in school, and they learn less when they are inschool.As a result, they are less productive later in life. The devastating economic consequences of illness and death are evident at the macroeconomic level, too.Demographic variables account for an estimated half of thedifference in growth rates between Africa and the rest ofthe world over 1965-90. 6Children require teachers to learn, and in some parts of Africa deaths from HIV/AIDSare making a major dent in the stock of teachers\u2014Zambianow loses half as many teachers as it trains to HIV/AIDS. 7 The AIDS epidemic has been estimated to knock 0.3-1.5percentage points off rates of economic growth. 8 During the 1990s the international community became more alarmed about the scale of ill health and death in thedeveloping world and at the growth of HIV/AIDS andtuberculosis.The decade also saw major new global healthinitiatives and partnerships, including UNAIDS (the JointUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS); the GlobalAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization; the Stop TBPartnership; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB andMalaria; and many others. With the 1990s drawing to aclose the international community decided that evenmore needed to be done.At the UN Millennium Summitin September 2001, 147 heads of states endorsed theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), nearly half ofwhich concern different aspects of health\u2014directly orindirectly (box 1).* * Throughout the report,\"health\" is interpreted broadly. For example, nutri- tion is both a key aspect of health in its own right and a key influence onother aspects of health.The health Millennium Development Goals: Progress and prospects Tracking progress toward the health goals is not straight- forward. Good-quality trend data are available for mostcountries only for under-ve mortality. Poorer-qualitytrend data are available for a limited set of countries forchild malnutrition. Limited trend data are available formaternal mortality, so this study used a model to forecastrates in the 1990s and beyond.Trend data are also limitedfor communicable diseases, and no modeling was under-taken for the report. A mixed score at half-time Of the Millennium Development Goals for which trenddata are available or estimated, the fastest progress has beenon malnutrition (table 1).The following factors are impor-tant in interpreting the mixed score at half time: The number of people living in on-track countries, not just the number of countries, matters .Worldwide 77 percent of the people living in the developing world live incountries that are on track to meet the malnutritiontarget. In Sub-Saharan Africa only 15 percent of thepeople live in an on-track country. Different indicators show different levels of improvement .F o r under-ve mortality the developing world managedonly a 2.5 percent average annual reduction in the1990s,well short of the target of 4.2 percent.For mater-nal mortality the average population-weighted declinewas just 3.2 percent, far from the 5.4 percent target. Health targets are relevant for middle-income countries as well as low-income countries. T wo of the most affluent regions\u2014Europe and Central Asia and Latin Americaand the Caribbean\u2014have the smallest shares of coun-tries on track for the child mortality target (22 percentand 10 percent). Only 4 percent of countries in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean are on track to meet thematernal mortality target. Evidence on how the poor are faring within countries is mixed . For malnutrition, within countries the poorest 20 per-cent of the population appears, on average, to have beenexperiencing broadly similar rates of reduction as thepopulation as a whole. But for under-ve mortality therate has been falling more slowly among the poor. 2|The Millennium Development Goals for Health020406080100120140160180 Child malnutrition per 100 populationUnder-five mortality per 1,000 live birthsMaternal mortality per 10,000 live birthsAIDS mortality per 100,000 populationTuberculosis mortality per 100,000 populationRate/ratio Poorest 25% of world's population 2nd poorest 25% of world's population 2nd richest 25% of world's population Richest 25% of world's populationFigure 1 The poorest countries suffer the highest burdens of premature mortality and malnutrition Source : References 130, 131, and 123.Box 1 The health-related Millennium Development Goals Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger.The target is to cut in half the proportion of people who suffer fromhunger between 1990 and 2015, with progress measuredin terms of the prevalence of underweight children underve.The target implies an average annual rate of reductionof 2.7 percent. Goal 4: Reduce child mortality.The target is to reduce the under-ve mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and2015, equivalent to an annual rate of reduction of 4.3percent. Goal 5: Improve maternal health.The target is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters between1990 and 2015, equivalent to an annual rate of reductionof 5.4 percent. Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. The target is to have halted and begun to reverse thespread of these diseases by 2015. Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability.The target is to cut in half the proportion of people without sustainableaccess to safe drinking water by 2015. Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development. The target is to provide access to affordable essential drugsin developing countries. Source : Reference 9.

As a comparison of the child mortality experiences in the 1980s and 1990s demonstrates, past performance is notnecessarily a good predictor of future performance. Thefact that a country is on track on the basis of its perfor-mance in the 1990s does not guarantee that it will main-tain the required annual rate of reduction of malnutritionor mortality during 2000-15. It is also possible that coun-tries currently off track may get on track in the second halfof the Millennium Development Goal \"window.\" STIMULI FROM OUTSIDE THE HEALTH SECTOR CAN BE EXPECTED The World Bank estimates that economic growth will fall somewhat in East Asia and thePacic in 2000-15, turn from negative to positive inEurope and Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, andincrease somewhat in Latin America and the Caribbean,the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia. 10 Primary education completion rates will also probablygrow faster in the new millennium as a result of the\"Education For All\" and \"Fast Track\" initiatives. But higherrates of educational attainment among women of child-bearing age will not show up until 2005 or so, and eventhen the rst full round of effects on under-ve mortalitywill not be felt until 2010. More relevant is the fact thatgender gaps in secondary education may well narrow morequickly in the new millennium than in the 1990s as a resultof the gender Millennium Development Goal.T o achieveparity with boys by 2015 in the proportion of the popula-tion 15 and over who have completed secondary educa-tion, girls' completion rates will have to grow faster in thenew millennium than in the 1990s in most regions, espe-cially in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacic.And if thewater Millennium Development Goal is to be reached,access rates will need to grow much faster in 2000-15,especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. EVEN WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND FASTER PROGRESS ON THE NONHEALTH GOALS ,MANY REGIONS WILL STILL MISS MANY OF THEHEALTH TARGETS The combined contributions to the decline in malnutrition and mortality of faster economicgrowth and achieving the gender and water goals could besignicant. In Europe and Central Asia progress on thesefronts might add as much as 1.4 percentage points to therate of decline of under-ve mortality, 1.1 percentagepoints to the rate of decline of maternal mortality, and justunder 1 percentage point to the annual rate of reduction inunderweight children. In South Asia they might add asmuch as 2.6 percentage points to the annual rate of reduc-tion in maternal mortality, taking it from 2.9 percent a yearto 5.5 percent.While these contributions will push coun-tries and regions rmly toward the targets, they will for themost part not get them there (gure 2). The picture isbleakest for under-ve mortality\u2014and for Sub-SaharanAfrica. Even with Sub-Saharan Africa's extra percentagepoint in annual reductions in under-ve mortality comingfrom economic growth and achievement of the gender andwater goals, its projected rate of reduction of under-vemortality for 2000-15 is still only 1.6 percent a year. WHY THE PICTURE MAY BE BLEAKER The assump- tions underlying these calculations are probably overopti-mistic.The gender and drinking water targets may well bemissed. And contrary to what has been assumed, it isunlikely in the absence of these stimuli that the pace ofdecline of the Millennium Development Indicatorsachieved in the 1990s will continue. The three variablesused to forecast maternal mortality in the model are likelyto be less conducive to reductions in maternal mortality inthe new millennium than in the 1990s. The goals matter for all countries Given the likelihood that many countries will miss severalof the goals, why should they be taken seriously? The goalsmatter for several reasons. Faster progress is important even if targets are missed. A key message of this report is that progress can be acceler-ated through a judicious mix of spending and policyand institutional reform. The goals facilitate benchmarking. By focusing on a limited set of outcomes, the Millennium Development Goalsshow what is achievable and where faster progress canbe made. The poor risk being left behind. One weakness of the Millennium Development Targets is that they arenational averages and so do not remind us automati-cally that progress needs to be for everyone,not just thebetter off. Progress has been uneven, with the poorercountries lagging behind the rest. For under-ve mor-tality, the poor within countries are lagging behind therest of the population. Progress needs to be monitoredand analyzed by income\u2014and efforts directed towardpopulation groups that are being left behind. Effective interventions exist\u2014they need to reach more people Lack of interventions is not the obstacle to faster progress toward the goals. It is the low levels of use\u2014especiallyamong the poor\u2014of interventions that work. 4|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthThe Challenges | 5Underweight -12%-10%-8%-6%-4%-2%0%2%4% East Asia and PacificEurope and Central AsiaLatin America and the Caribbean Middle East and North AfricaSouth AsiaSub-Saharan AfricaAnnual percentage growth rate Extra government health spending Extrasectoral contributions Current Required 2000 -15 TargetFigure 2 Faster economic growth and other changes outside the health sector will help move regions toward the targets, but in most cases it will not get them there Under-five mortality -8%-7%-6%-5%-4%-3%-2%-1%0% East Asia and PacificEurope and Central AsiaLatin America and the CaribbeanMiddle East and North AfricaSouth AsiaSub-Saharan AfricaAnnual percentage growth rate Extra government health spending Extrasectoral contributions Current Required 2000 -15 TargetMaternal mortality -12%-10%-8%-6%-4%-2%0% East Asia and PacificEurope and Central AsiaLatin America and the CaribbeanMiddle East and North AfricaSouth AsiaSub- Saharan AfricaAnnual percentage growth rate Extra government health spending Extrasectoral contributions Current Required 2000 -15 Target Source: World Bank staff.The array of existing effective interventions is impressive The available interventions constitute a powerful arsenal for preventing and treating the main causes of malnutritionand death (see chapter 3, table 3.1). Diarrhea, pneumonia,and malaria account for 52 percent of deaths among chil-dren worldwide. For each of these causes, there is at leastone proven effective preventive intervention and at leastone proven effective treatment intervention, each capableof being delivered in a low-income setting. In most cases,several proven effective interventions exist. For diarrhea\u2014the second-leading cause of child deaths\u2014there are nofewer than ve proven preventive interventions and threeproven treatment interventions. Effective interventions are underused, especially by the poor Why, then, are the high rates of malnutrition and death in the developing world so high? For one reason or another,people do not receive the effective interventions that couldsave their lives or make them well nourished. In upper mid-dle-income and high-income countries, 90 percent of chil-dren receive DPT3 vaccinations, more than 90 percent ofbabies are delivered by a medically trained person, and morethan 90 percent of pregnant women make at least one ante-natal visit. In South Asia less than 50 percent of pregnantwomen have antenatal checkups, and only 20 percent ofbabies are delivered by a medically trained person.The storyis similar for other childhood interventions\u2014and for inter-ventions for other goals. Of the estimated 6 million peoplein low-income and middle-income countries currentlyneeding antiretroviral therapy, only 300,000 receive it. InAsia, where more than 7 million people are living withHIV/AIDS, no country has exceeded 5 percent antiretrovi-ral therapy coverage. Just as shortfalls in coverage vary across countries, they vary within countries, with the poor and other deprivedgroups invariably lagging behind.These groups are less likelyto receive full basic immunization coverage, have their deliv-eries attended by a medically trained person, or make at leastone antenatal care visit to a medically trained person.On thepositive side, the poor for the most part are making fasterprogress in coverage, reflecting that the better off alreadyhave high coverage rates for many interventions.Progress hasbeen more propoor in professionally delivered interventions. Underuse of effective interventions costs lives The low use of effective interventions\u2014in the developingworld in general and among the poor in particular\u2014trans-lates into rates of mortality, morbidity, and malnutritionthat are far higher than they need be.If use of all the proven effective childhood preventive and treatment interventions were to rise from current levels to99 percent (95 percent for breastfeeding), the number ofunder-ve deaths worldwide could fall by as much as 63percent. 11Deaths from malaria and measles could be all but eliminated. And deaths from diarrhea, pneumonia, andHIV/AIDS could be dramatically reduced. If coverage ratesof the key maternal mortality interventions were increasedfrom current levels to 99 percent, 391,000 maternal deathsworldwide\u201474 percent of current maternal deaths\u2014mightbe averted. One intervention stands out as especiallyimportant: access to essential obstetric care, which accountsfor more than half the deaths averted (gure 3). What countries need to do to rise to the challenges If the lack of interventions is not keeping countries from achieving the goals, what is? What do countries need to doto accelerate progress toward them? 6|The Millennium Development Goals for Health0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4Antibiotics for preterm rupture of membranesAntibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosisCalcium supplements during pregnancyMagnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsiaActive management in third stage of laborDrugs for preventing malariaTreatment for iron deficiencyTetanus toxoid immunizationImproved access to comprehensive essential obstetric careImproved access to safe abortion services Percentage of maternal deaths avertedHemorrhage Puerperal infection Eclampsia Obstructed labor Abortion complications Malaria Anemia TetanusFigure 3 Full use of existing interventions would reduce maternal deaths dramatically Source: World Bank staff estimates.Extra government health spending is needed, but it is not enough Some argue that the cause of slow progress is the lack of government health spending.12The evidence presented in support of this view is not altogether compelling.Arbitraryassumptions are made about the links between scaling upexpenditures and intervention coverage rates, and noexplicit assumptions are made about the links betweencoverage levels and health outcomes.There is no assurancethat incurring the extra government health spendingclaimed to be necessary would reduce mortality at all\u2014letalone by the proportions required to reach the goals. In fact, some writers have argued that government health spending has little impact at the margin on health outcomes,once the effects of other determinants have been accountedfor.The reason? The many weak links in the chain runningfrom government spending to health outcomes. 13-15Their evidence has limitations. It refers simply to child mortality,not to health outcomes in general. It indicates what happensto child mortality among the whole population, in an aver-age country, and therefore hides signicant spending effectsamong specic subpopulations and in well-governed coun-tries. indicates what would happen to child mor- tality if additional government spending were to take theform of a proportional scaling up of all government healthprograms, not what would happen if extra spending werefocused on specic subpopulations or specic programs. Policies and institutions mediate the impact of government health spending In countries with good governance, additional government health spending does reduce child mortality.19This result is consistent with recent studies that nd that the elasticity ofinfant mortality to development assistance depends on thequality of a country's policies and institutions. Developmentassistance has a stronger effect in countries with strong poli-cies and institutions than in countries with only averagequality policies and institutions\u2014and an insignicant effectin countries where policies and institutions are weak. 20,21 The assertion is also consistent with the ndings of a studyundertaken for this report, which includes other outcomesalongside child mortality and uses the Bank's CountryPolicy and Institutional Assessment index to measure the quality of policies and institutions. How much would reaching the goals cost in well-governed countries? Well-governed countries with good policies and institu- tions could, in principle, achieve the goals simply by scalingup their expenditures on existing programs in proportion tocurrent allocations. In practice, however, the amount ofextra spending required would likely be prohibitive. TakeEast Asia and the Pacic. If economic growth proceeds asexpected and the other relevant Millennium DevelopmentTargets are hit, the region would achieve the required ratesof reduction of underweight and maternal mortality evenwithout additional government health spending. But itwould miss the under-ve mortality target.T o hit this tar-get, a minimum of ve percentage points would need to beadded to the rate of growth of the government health shareof GDP .That would take the projected share of GDP spenton government health programs to 3.7 percent in 2015\u2014more than twice what it would be if the 1990s pattern ofgrowth continues. In Sub-Saharan Africa the conclusions are even starker. Even if faster economic growth materializes and the othertargets are hit, the share of government health spending inGDP would need to grow by an additional 12.3 percentagepoints a year, taking the share to 12.2 percent in 2015.Compare that with a 2000 gure of 1.8 percent and a 2015forecast of 2.2 percent based on the 1990s annual growthof just 1.2 percent in the government health share of GDP . Poorly governed countries cannot expect to make much progress toward the Millennium DevelopmentGoals simply by scaling up their expenditures on existingprograms in proportion to current allocations. And whilewell-governed countries could in principle simply scaleup existing spending to reach the targets, this is unlikely tobe affordable\u2014for them or for their donors. What are the implications for health spending? The rst is that targeting additional government spending is impor-tant for both sets of countries.The second is that buildinggood policies and institutions is important for all coun-tries: it increases the productivity not just of additionalspending but also of existing spending commitments. Butwhat do better policies and institutions entail in the healthsector? Health systems are very broad\u2014far broader thanmany people think.Weak policies and institutions can ariseat several points along the pathway from governmenthealth spending to health outcomes (gure 4).The reportuses this framework to tackle the difcult question of howto build stronger policies and institutions. The Challenges | 7 The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment is an annual assessment by World Bank staff of the quality of International Bank for Reconstructionand Development and International Development Association borrowers'policy and institutional performance in areas relevant to economic growthand poverty reduction. It consists of 20 equally weighted criteria represent-ing policy dimensions of an effective poverty reduction and growth strategy,such as economic management, structural policies, policies for social inclu-sion and equity, and public sector management.Improving expenditure allocations and targeting Geographic targeting In most countries, governments spend most of their money in cities, and spending disproportionately benetsthe better off. 22,23Resource allocation formulas can be used to reduce government spending gaps across regions.24 In Bolivia, which has used such formulas since 1994 aspart of its decentralization efforts, some fairly large\u2014andpropoor\u2014improvements in maternal and child healthindicators have occurred. Targeting resources to poorregions and provinces may benet from nontraditionalmechanisms for priority-setting and implementation, suchas social investment funds. A recent impact evaluation inBolivia concluded that such funds were responsible for adecline in under-ve mortality from 88.5 per 1,000 livebirths to 65.6. 25 Changing the allocation of spending across levels of care Developing country spending on health is characterized by asurprisingly high concentration of spending on secondaryand tertiary infrastructure and personnel\u2014despite low bedoccupancy rates. Some governments have tried to scale backthe share of hospital spending.Tanzania,for example,reducedthe share from 60 percent in 2000 to 43 percent in 2002. Simply reallocating the budget toward primary care need not result in higher payoffs to government healthspending in lower malnutrition and child and maternalmortality, however. 14,15In many instances service providers have failed to deliver good-quality care and use resourcesefciently.The trick is to couple expenditure reallocationswith measures to improve the performance of primary carefacilities and district hospitals\u2014and measures to ensure thathouseholds actually demand relevant interventions. T argeting specic programs Programs such as the directly observed treatment, short-course for tuberculosis (DOTS) and Integrated Manage-ment of Childhood Illness for child health are goodexamples of programs that may yield high returns to gov-ernment spending at the margin. Both are the subject ofongoing evaluation, but early results are encouraging. 26,27 A recent World Bank study28in India provides further 8|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthGovernment Policies and ActionsHealth Sector and Related SectorsMillennium Development GoalsHouseholds/Communities Health Underweight Under-five mortality rate Maternal mortality ratio Communicable diseases Cultural norms Community institutions Social capital EnvironmentHuman Physical FinancialUse of health services Dietary, sanitary, and sexualpractices LifestyleHousehold actions and risk factors Community factorsPrivate: for-profit, nonprofit Public: hospitals, primary care,informalHealth providers Health sector policies at macro, health systemand micro levels Government spending Public and private insurance; financingand coverage DrugsFinance and inputsHousehold assets Food Energy Roads Water and sanitationSuppliers in related sectorsInfrastructure Transport Energy Agriculture Water and sanitationOther policiesOther MDG outcomes PovertyFigure 4 Paths to better health, nutrition, and population outcomes Source: Reference 132.support for the idea that the way government spending is allocated across programs makes a difference to its impacton the Millennium Development Indicators. T argeting specic population groups Many countries subsidize all government health servicesfor everyone.These blanket subsidy schemes fail to targetinterventions that give rise to externalities, and they fail todisproportionately benet the poor\u2014this, despite thestronger equity case for subsidizing their care and the factthat they tend to bear a disproportionate burden of mal-nutrition and child and maternal mortality. T argeting spending to remove bottlenecks Another approach is to assess the health sector impedimentsto faster progress in a country, identify ways to remove them,and estimate both the costs of removing them and the likelyimpacts of their removal on Millennium Development Goaloutcomes. 29Work along these lines\u2014sometimes referred to as marginal budgeting for bottlenecks\u2014has begun in severalAfrican countries and India. 30In Mali key bottlenecks were identied for supporting home-based practices and deliver-ing periodic and continual professional care.These includedlow access to affordable commodities and the need for com-munity-based support for home-based care; low geographi-cal access to preventive care (immunization,vitamin supplementation, and antenatal care); shortages ofqualied nurses and midwives; and an absence of effectivethird-party payment mechanisms for the poor for profes-sional continuous care. Combining estimates of the costs of measures to remove these bottlenecks with estimates of the mortalityreduction on their removal gives an elasticity of mortalityto government health spending that compares very favor-ably with the elasticities for untargeted government healthspending\u2014even those for well-governed countries withgood policies and institutions. Only time\u2014and carefulmonitoring and evaluation\u2014will tell whether these esti-mates turn out to be accurate. Better policies toward households\u2014as producers and demanders of care Improving people's health is the overarching aim of the health sector.But households are not just the endpoint of thesector's activity. They are major actors. Indeed, they play a dual role: as users of health services delivered by professionalproviders (if patients don't demand care, providers cannotdeliver it) and as producers of health through the delivery ofhome-based interventions and in their everyday healthbehaviors (this is especially important for child health). Inboth roles they face barriers. Policymakers need to be awareof those barriers and to formulate appropriate policies. Lowering nancial barriers Low income is a barrier to the use of most health interven-tions. Economic growth is therefore an important weapon inthe war against malnutrition and mortality. 31,32But social protection programs are also important. South Africa's old-age pension scheme increased the height of under-ve blackchildren by eight centimeters, half a year's growth. 33,34Also important are informal community solidarity schemes,whichoften substitute for formal social protection programs. 35 The other part of the affordability equation is price. Higher money prices tend to reduce demand\u2014especiallyamong the poor\u2014unless accompanied by improvementsin service quality. 36In many cases out-of-pocket payments are informal rather than formal.37And it is not just the payments to health providers that matter\u2014users of healthservices incur other money costs in using health facilities,including transportation costs. User charges for Millennium Development Goal inter- ventions are to be discouraged.Why? Many of these inter-ventions involve benets that spill over to people who donot receive the intervention (immunization is a classicexample). But an equity case can also be made for reduc-ing prices facing the poor and near-poor, even wherethere are no spillovers. Subsidies should thus be targeted toservices with spillovers and to the poor. In practice, theyare often badly targeted in at least one respect if not both.There are exceptions, however. In Ifakara, Tanzania, avoucher program for mosquito nets was launched success-fully for pregnant women and children under ve. 38-40 And in Indonesia a health card introduced during the eco-nomic crisis increased use among the poor. 41 Some recent programs, especially in Latin America, have not simply made health care affordable for the poor\u2014theyhave made it protable. Rather than simply reducing thecost of using specic interventions these programs providecash payments to users, linked to specic interventions andrestricted to certain groups\u2014often poor mothers and theirchildren.The experience with these programs, in targetingand impact, is encouraging. 42-47 There is another reason for limiting user charges. Risk aversion coupled with the unpredictability of illness pro-vides a motivation for pooling risks through an insurancescheme. Lack of insurance and the consequent exposure tothe risk of medical expenses cause households to hold morewealth (and more of their wealth in liquid form) than they The Challenges | 9 The term \"household\" is used here to refer to whatever grouping of peo- ple share responsibility for health. It is not limited to parents (caregivers ofchildren might be grandparents, aunts, stepparents) and can encompass thebroad array of kinship and household patterns around the world.otherwise would in the hope that they can smooth their consumption when health shocks occur.48Evidence from rural China suggests that households fail in these efforts andthat the poor have the least success in self-insuring againstincome shocks. 49Insurance in the developing world is very limited, and those who are least able to smooth consump-tion without insurance are the least likely to have insurancecoverage. 50Governments have a role to play here. In Egypt a school health insurance program for all children attendingschool resulted in larger increases in coverage among thepoor than among other groups and achieved considerableimpact on use and out-of-pocket expenditures. 51 Empowering women Women exercise little control over household resources inmany countries.All else constant, such women are less likelyto receive antenatal care, to have antenatal visits, and to havevisits in the rst trimester of pregnancy. 52Microcredit pro- grams aimed at poor women are thought to be one way ofincreasing women's nancial autonomy. Whether theyincrease the use of maternal and health services is less clear. 53 Also important is a woman's ability to make decisions moregenerally. In India, although contraceptives are readily avail-able in retail shops, community pressure or disapproval byhusbands often prevent women from using them. Providing information\u2014enhancing knowledge Lack of knowledge is a major factor behind poor health. Itresults in people not seeking care when they need it,despite the absence of price barriers. In Bolivia a large frac-tion of poor babies are not delivered by a trained attendanteven though the mothers are eligible for free care underthe Maternal and Child Health Insurance program. 54Lack of knowledge also results in people, especially poor people,seeking and receiving inappropriate care\u2014and paying forit. 55Ignorance may also result in people not getting the maximum health gain out of inputs they have available tothem for use. Many people do not know that piped waterin many countries requires further purication or thathand-washing confers much of the health benet of pipedwater. Not surprisingly, piped water has a much greaterimpact on the prevalence of diarrhea among the childrenof the better off and better educated. 56 Better-educated women\u2014especially those with a sec- ondary education\u2014achieve better health outcomes forthemselves and their children. 57They do this not by using health-specic knowledge that they acquire at school butby using general numeracy and literacy skills learned atschool to acquire health-specic knowledge later in life. 58 So,while better-educated girls will mean healthier womenand healthier children in years to come, a shorter andmore direct route to increasing health-specic knowledgeand skills is through information dissemination and coun-seling in the health sector. One venue for delivering health messages is the public facility. A lactation clinic at the Children's Hospital inIslamabad, Pakistan, promoted exclusive breastfeeding byaltering women's perceptions of its importance and bycounseling them on techniques. 59But a focus on public health facilities is far from ideal, since many people,including many poor people, do not use them when theyfall ill\u2014and may not even seek care at all. Programs in thecommunity\u2014where the conveyers of knowledge seek outtarget groups\u2014seem likely to have a better chance ofreaching a broader group and reaching the poor. There are several success stories here. In Brazil health knowledge among mothers and feeding practices improvedafter health workers trained by the Integration of ChildhoodManagement Illness provided information and counseling athealth facilities and in the community. 30After only 18 months the nutritional status of children in the areaimproved as well. Social marketing and media campaignshave also proved effective in some circumstances. 38,39,60 Reducing time costs Transportation systems, road infrastructure, and geographyinfluence the demand for care delivered by formalproviders through their impact on time costs, which canbe substantial. 61-65In rural communities, where roads are poor and transport unreliable, the time spent waiting fortransport is also a major cost.Time costs tend to be a majorissue for maternal mortality. Health centers are unable toprovide essential obstetric care for a complicated delivery,and hospitals, which could provide the needed care, arehard to reach. Road rehabilitation and other transportprojects are important here. 66But so are subsidies linked to the use of health services. Malaysia and Sri Lanka pro-vide free or subsidized transportation to hospitals in emer-gencies. 67Other options to tackle inaccessibility include engaging in outreach, building new public facilities inunderserved areas, and establishing partnerships betweengovernment and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),private providers, or community organizations. Providing access to water and sanitation The availability of plenty of water and improved sanitationare associated with better maternal and child health out-comes, at least among the better educated, even after con-trolling for other influences. 61,63,68-74This isn't altogether surprising. Hand-washing is easier if the household haspiped water that provides readily available quantities ofsafe water. And the safe disposal of feces is easier if thehousehold has an improved form of sanitation.The devel-oping world lags well behind the industrial world in 10|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthboth\u2014and poor people fare especially badly.They are less likely to be connected to a network, and the sources theyrely on tend to be more costly per liter than the net-worked services used by the better off. 75 The two challenges from a health perspective are to increase access to water and sanitation infrastructure andto ensure that people know how to get the maximumhealth benets from such investments. The rst wasaddressed extensively in the World Bank's 2004 World Development Report: Making Services Work for Poor People . 75 The second is addressed in chapter 8 of this volume. Improving health service delivery Health providers\u2014in both the public and private sectors, and in both the formal and informal sectors\u2014deliver inter-ventions of relevance to the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. Many are efcient, deliver high-quality care, and areresponsive to their patients. But many are not. As a result,resources\u2014public and private\u2014are wasted and facilities situnderused. Patients often receive care\u2014and pay for it, outof very limited means\u2014that is inappropriate to their needs.They may also receive downright dangerous care. T wo things can make a difference. One is the quality of management. Better management means a clearer delin-eation of responsibilities and accountabilities inside orga-nizations, a clearer link between performance and reward,and so on. Management means getting accountabilitiesright within an organization. The other thing that canmake a difference is getting accountabilities right betweenthe organization and the public. 75Some strategies work along a \"short route\" leading directly from the patient tothe provider (gure 5). Others work along a \"long route\"leading from the citizen to the policymaker and thence tothe provider. Still others work along both routes simulta-neously. Improving management\u2014increasing accountability within provider organizations Much of the world's public sector is managed through what is, in effect, a command-and-control structure.Initiative and decisionmaking are exercised only at thehighest level. Problems at lower levels are passed up tohigher levels for decisions.There are few managers in thetrue sense of the word. Instead, administrators executedecisions according to previously agreed protocols andrules, with little or no scope for autonomous decision-making at facilities. Management styles have recently begun to change, though the impact is not altogether clear. Responsibilityfor tasks and decisionmaking is delegated to specic partsof the organization and to specic individuals. Individualaccountability is emphasized, and there is a focus on per-formance\u2014not inputs or processes but outputs and out-comes. Good performance is rewarded, nancially or insome other way.There is also a focus on clients and a beliefthat an organization is ultimately accountable to its clients.A client-oriented strategy emphasizes customer choiceand satisfaction. Business techniques enhance performanceand are a standard part of strategic planning. The new approach is evident in several countries, including Malaysia. Elements of the approach are also evi-dent in successful nutrition and child health programs. Inthe Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Program, in India,community nutrition workers were given clearly denedduties. Information on outputs enabled the community tokeep them accountable, but it also enabled the nutritionworkers to see how their program was working. In thePrograma de Agentes de Saude, in C\u00e9ara, Brazil, healthagents and nurse-supervisors were assigned clear tasks andgiven clear responsibilities.The program has been creditedwith substantially reducing child mortality. 76The intended outcomes of the program were emphasized to healthworkers and members of the public. Good team perfor-mance was rewarded with a prize.And health agents wereheld accountable through community-based monitoring. Increasing the accountability of provider organizations to the public GOVERNANCE PARTICIPATION Having community representatives participate in the governance and oversightof providers can improve the productivity and quality ofpublic sector providers. Relatively little is known aboutthe impact, and several governments have had difculty The Challenges | 11CompactVoiceThe state Politicians Policymakers Longrouteofaccountability ClientpowerProviders Frontline OrganizationsManagementCitizens and clients Coalitions and inclusion Nonpoor and poor ServicesShortrouteFigure 5 What makes service providers accountable Source: Based on reference 75.establishing meaningful participation. But where it has been established, the changes have been for the better. InBurkino Faso participation of community representativesin public primary healthcare clinics increased immuniza-tion coverage, the availability of essential drugs, and thepercentage of women with two or more antenatal visits. 77 In Peru comparisons of primary healthcare clinics withand without governance participation indicated that gov-ernance was associated with decreases in staff absenteeismand waiting times and increases in perceived quality bypatients. 22,78The approach probably works best for pri- mary care and when strong technical and advisory supportis provided to community representatives. CONTRACTING Contracting can take the form of internal contracts within the public sector or externalcontracts between the public sector and the private sector,whether nonprot or for-prot. Contracts are betweenthe policymaker and the provider,specifying remunerationfor the delivery of certain types of service, with or withouta quality threshold. Payment is tied to some measurableaspect of performance. Some contracting arrangementsalso strengthen the short route of accountability\u2014byencouraging patients to choose between providers andhaving the payment follow the patient, for example.Contracts with NGOs commonly include outreach inurban slums for health promotion or education, servicesfor stigmatized or hard-to-reach groups, and social mar-keting of priority health goods or services, such as con-doms and oral rehydration salts. In the for-prot privatesector, contracting often focuses on primary care servicesand services for which the public sector lacks capacity,such as diagnostic and high-tech services. Evidence on the impact of contracting within the public sector is mixed, but such contracting seems to work best inmiddle-income countries. In several countries in Europeand Central Asia, there is evidence of positive impact fromperformance-based payment at the primary care level. 79-82 In Argentina and Nicaragua social security institutes haveincreased productivity by establishing capitation-based pay-ments for an integrated package of inpatient and ambula-tory services. 83In several countries in Europe and Central Asia the introduction of capped case-based payments forinpatient services was followed by an increase in servicesand a reduction in average length of stay. 79Quality has not deteriorated because of skimping on costly unobservableaspects of quality. In the former Soviet republics and inLatin America, however, the results are more ambiguous.Key influences on the success of contracts within the pub-lic sector include whether the provider has the ability torespond, whether service commitments are congruentwith funding levels, whether output and key componentsof performance expectations are easily measurable (as inprimary health care), and how far capacity-strengtheningof the payer or funder is addressed as a central part of theinitiative. Contracting with nonprots is most common in low- income countries. Most cases have had positive impacts ontarget outcome or output variables. In Bangladesh con-tracts with nonprots for the planning and implementationof an expanded program on immunization was creditedwith a dramatic increase in immunization. In Haiti con-tracting for a primary healthcare package also signicantlyincreased immunization coverage. 84In Bangladesh, Mada- gascar, and Senegal signicant reductions in nutrition rateswere attributed to contracting initiatives. 85Only a few cases assess efciency. Contracting with nonprots worksbest when the contractors have well-functioning account-ability arrangements and strong intrinsic motivation. Thegovernment needs to be capable of assessing, selecting, andmanaging the ongoing relationship with contractors. Itmust be able to fulll its side of the deal (contractual agree-ments on funding are genuine) and not interfere with therunning of the services. Results on contracting with for-prots are mixed. Efciency gains were achieved in contracting for high-tech diagnostic services in Thailand. 86But experience from the hospital sector warns that weak governmentcontracting capacity often allows the provider to captureefciency gains or expand volume to generate moreincome. In Zimbabwe the cost per service decreased, butthe lack of volume control led to an increase in totalcost. 87Other adverse outcomes are also possible. In Brazil contracting with for-prot hospitals led to increases inaccess but also to false billing and cream-skimming toavoid costly patients. 88These problems seem less pro- nounced in primary health care. In Peru and El Salvadorcontracting with private primary healthcare providersincreased access, choice, and consumer satisfaction. 89 Contracting with for-prot providers seems to work bestwhen the government invests in the development ofcapacity to manage the contracting process, 90when qual- ity is at least as high in the private sector as in the publicsector (ability to monitor quality is usually low), andwhen it involves primary care or other relatively observ-able services (diagnostic services). DECENTRALIZATION Decentralization can increase patient leverage because local governments are more easilypressured than central ones. It strengthens policymaker-provider accountability because the government supervisorgets closer to the provider.But the impact of decentralizationon the health sector has been mixed in low-income coun-tries. In Tanzania it improved the efciency of and access to 12|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthprimary healthcare services, but in Ghana efciency declined.91There is less evidence on the impact in middle- income countries,though in Colombia it has improved bothresponsiveness and equity. 92One important factor influenc- ing the success of decentralization is whether the other armof the long route of accountability (the voter-policymakerlink) is functioning well. Also important are building localgovernment capacity\u2014planning, supervision, budgeting,expenditure and nancial management\u2014and setting upmechanisms to ensure continuing capacity to cover corepublic functions. Ensuring adequate human resources for health A common lament in international health is that faster progress toward the health-related Millennium Development Goals isbeing impeded by a variety of human resources problems. The issues Human resource stocks in health are often low, and insome countries they are falling. In Europe and CentralAsia there are on average 3.1 physicians per 1,000 popula-tion, in Sub-Saharan Africa just 0.1.Tanzania is projectedto see its health workforce fall from 49,000 in 1994 to36,000 in 2015. 93Many developing countries appear to face the double burden of low personnel inflows and highpersonnel outflows. 94-98 Skills are often woefully inadequate, with misdiagnosis and mistreatment commonplace.99Even if the correct treatment is administered, there is no assurance that it willbe administered successfully. In the public sector in Indiain the early 1990s less than 45 percent of patients diag-nosed with tuberculosis were successfully treated. 100 It is not just the level of skills that matter\u2014it is also the skill mix. A recent study in Tanzania found an excess ofunskilled labor of 5,000 full-time equivalents and a short-age of skilled labor of 8,000. 93 Low application to the job is another concern. Recent random surveys of primary health facilities in six developingcountries found absenteeism rates of between 19 percent(Papua New Guinea) and 43 percent (India). 75In Tanzania time-and-motion studies showed overall staff productivityin public facilities as low as 57 percent,with only 37 percentof staff time spent on patient care and as much as 10 percentspent on irregular breaks and social contacts. 101 Narrowing compensation differentials Low wages in the medical professions relative to wages inother professions discourage people from entering traininginstitutions,completing their studies,and joining the profes-sion if they graduate. They also encourage people in theprofession to think about leaving\u2014to exit from the laborforce, join another profession, or leave for another coun-try. 102And they encourage absenteeism, which makes for higher workloads for those left behind, further reducingmotivation and prompting further absenteeism and exits.Low rates of compensation in rural settings help explainrural-urban imbalances. And compensation differentialsbetween the public and private sectors influence transitionsfrom the public sector to the private\u2014and occasionallyback again. Narrowing compensation differentials is clearly an important potential policy tool. Thailand has attractedback medical professionals through a reverse brain-drainprogram offering generous research funding and monetaryincentives. 103Zambia more than doubled nursing salaries with the support of 16 development partners. Severalcountries have experimented with bonus schemes forhealth workers working in rural areas, some successfully. There are, however, limits to what can be achieved through changes in compensation alone. Fortunately,research suggests that nonpecuniary aspects of jobs alsomatter to people. A recent study from India shows whatpublic and private health workers hope to get from theirjob and the extent to which they get it (gure 6). 104It shows that in the public sector, health workers want\u2014andhave\u2014good working relationships with colleagues, free-dom from political interference, and absence of bribes.What they lack are the tools and materials they need toapply their skills, training opportunities and opportunitiesto advance, employment benets, good physical workingconditions, income, and time for personal and family life.A recent study in Uganda found that medical staff work-ing in religious nonprot institutions work for a wagebelow the market rate but that these institutions providemore propoor services than other providers and more ser-vices with a public good element\u2014dimensions of the jobthat the underpaid staff presumably derive some satisfac-tion from. 105There would seem to be much scope for using the results of such studies to build feasible and betterhuman resource policies. Rening recruitment and training People raised in rural areas are more likely to practice inrural locations and to choose family medicine. 106In Thailand rural recruitment and training yielded some suc-cess. Evidence suggests that rural service of graduateslengthened, with two-thirds of the graduates continuingtheir rural placement after their compulsory years. 103 Training opportunities are clearly valued by health work- ers. But training makes health workers more marketable and The Challenges | 13more likely to leave the public sector for the private sector or foreign countries. One way around this is to focus gov-ernment spending on the development of specic skills andto leave health workers themselves to pay\u2014in the form oflower wages\u2014for any general training.This seems sensiblein the light of the emerging evidence on the poaching andinternational migration of health workers. The countriesthat have emulated the training standards of industrial coun-tries (such as Ghana) are those that have been most vulnera-ble to poaching by them. 75Training in areas of special relevance to the goals\u2014such as Integrated Management ofChildhood Illness 107,108\u2014provides a good example of spe- cic training unlikely to be especially valued in industrialcountries. Realigning the skills mix represents another option. Many interventions for the Millennium DevelopmentGoals can be delivered by relatively low-skilled providers,such as community health workers. In addition to beingcheaper, these providers are more likely to be willing towork in rural areas and less likely to lured away by the pri- vate sector, urban provider organizations, or foreign healthsectors. Ensuring appropriate and affordable medicines and other health supplies Medicines and other commodities are key components of the arsenal of effective interventions against child andmaternal mortality, and against communicable diseasemortality. Here, too, are major concerns.Getting drugs to the frontline Some countries have succeeded in improving the supplychain through better logistics. In Ghana, as part of the\"Strategies for Enhancing Access to Medicines\" initiativefunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, part ofthe drug distribution system has undergone innovativereforms to improve mission hospitals' use of medicines, withgood results. Better management is important. But withoutinstitutional arrangements that give the right incentives tothe different actors involved in drug distribution and pre-scription, drug availability will improve only marginally. Where drugs are not in facilities, part of the reason\u2014 sometimes a major reason\u2014is that providers have littleincentive to have them there. Surveys in Uganda suggestthat on average about 70 percent of medical supplies anddrugs in public facilities were appropriated by staff for usein their private work. 109-111Where providers have an incentive to have the drugs available, they often are. Theconcern then is that they will prescribe inappropriate orpoor-quality drugs. Limiting this through regulation andbehavior change is not impossible, but it is not easy either.There may be scope in changing the incentive arrange-ments in the distribution of drugs\u2014by contracting out thedistribution of medicines to the private sector, for example. Information asymmetries and drug regulation Health education in various forms (providing informationon dosages and how to administer to patients) and buildingtrust between patients and prescribers have helped increase 14|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthAndhra Pradesh: Public health workers Good physical working conditions Knowing what is expected and being able to achieve it Freedom from political interference Not needing to pay bribes Security of job Training opportunities Challenging work Tools and materials to use skills fully on the job Good opportunities to advanceGood working relationship with colleaguesSuperior recognizes good workRespected and trusted by clientsNo interference by superiorsDesirable locationTime for personal or family lifeGood employment benefitsGood income Important to health workers?

All countries require some form of drug regulatory framework. It is unreasonable and largely inappropriate toexpect developing countries to set up a drug regulatoryauthority with the resources and capacity of, say, the U.S.Food and Drug Administration or the European MedicinesAgency. Policymakers can, however, usefully explore, iden-tify, and set up a drug regulatory authority that implementsthe most essential functions in an efcient, transparent, andaffordable way. Policies toward drug prices and drug spending Drug costs are often not covered by insurance at all, orthey are covered only partially.This reflects both the lackof insurance in the developing world and the tendency toexclude at least some (usually outpatient) drug costs fromschemes that do exist. The exclusion of outpatient drugcosts makes little sense, since it deters people from bothtaking preventive care and seeking care from a low-levelprovider as soon as they fall ill. They may well get evensicker later and end up in the hospital, where they incurlarge inpatient bills against which they are fully covered. Governments have ways of influencing drug prices\u2014 both the prices they (and ultimately taxpayers) pay whenthey subsidize the cost and the prices consumers pay out ofpocket.They can exert a direct influence over retail pricesby regulating them (through xed prices, risk-sharingagreements, and reference-based pricing schemes). Theycan also influence retail prices indirectly through theirpolicies toward the domestic pharmaceutical industry.Andthey can make large bulk purchases from manufacturersand then sell drugs at wholesale prices to the private non-prot sector.Whether governments sell the drugs they pur-chase or keep them for use or sale in their own facilities,they can exert a major influence over drug prices byengaging in strategic purchasing\u2014purchasing from abroad,pooling procurement efforts with other groups (includinginternational agencies), and focusing on generics. Research and development and intellectual property The lengthening of patents under the Trade-RelatedAspects of International Property Rights agreement led toconcerns that new drugs would become even less afford-able to developing countries. In August 2003 it was agreedthat countries facing public health emergencies withoutthe capacity to manufacture medicines could still use theDoha compulsory licensing opportunities by contractingwith foreign rms. So far, the provision has been cited toincrease the supply only of antiretroviral therapy. An addi-tional route to making antiretrovirals affordable is theAccelerating Access Initiative, launched by ve UN agen-cies and ve pharmaceutical companies to reduce the highcost of antiretroviral drugs and increase access toHIV/AIDS care and treatment. One way out of theimpasse on neglected diseases is to separate research anddevelopment from drug manufacturing and sales. 114 Industrial countries, donors, or foundations would committo purchasing\u2014for a sizable fee\u2014the patent resulting fromthe development of a major new vaccine or drug and thenmake the patent available freely to drug manufacturers.Another innovative idea is the global public-private part-nership known as the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative,a public-private partnership supporting and speeding vac-cine development in order to expand the number andquality of new vaccines. Strengthening core public health functions Vulnerable populations need to be informed, educated,and protected from risks and damages. Public health regu-lations need to be established and enforced. Infrastructureneeds to be in place to reduce the impact of emergenciesand disasters on health.All this needs to be done through apublic health system that is transparent and accountable. Developing country governments generally recognize that these public health functions are important, but theyoften lack the capacity and nancial resources to imple-ment them. Indeed, few low-income countries invest inthese public health functions. National strategies for disease prevention, treatment, and control By employing skilled public health professionals, the gov- ernment can develop and enforce standards, monitor thehealth of communities and populations, and emphasizehealth education, public information, health promotion,and disease prevention. Public action can help improveconsumer knowledge and change attitudes so that privatemarkets can operate effectively to meet the needs of thepoor\u2014through, for example, the social marketing ofinsecticide-treated bednets to reduce transmission ofmalaria or condoms to reduce transmission of HIV . Government-led monitoring and evaluation Integrated disease surveillance, program assessment, andcollection and analysis of demographic and vital registra-tion data are essential if governments and donors are to The Challenges | 15ascertain whether policies and programs are having an impact on the health goals. Chapter 2 presents a list ofintermediate indicators and \"proxies\" for the goals that canhelp monitor progress, test the impact of policies, andadjust programs going forward.There is a need for muchgreater investments in systems to monitor these interme-diate indicators. Disease surveillance then helps determinewhether health outcomes are improving. Some good practices in surveillance are being devel- oped, in Brazil and elsewhere. But not all developingcountries can afford to invest in the infrastructure requiredfor strong surveillance systems. Most rely on alternativeshort- to medium-term solutions for data gathering, suchas intermittent household surveys, health facility surveys,and simplied facility-based routine reporting. A fewcountries have made special efforts to improve the surveil-lance of a specic intervention, such as tuberculosis treat-ment or immunization, while others attempt to monitorprogress toward a specic Millennium Development Goal.Some governments are explicitly developing or modifyingtheir monitoring and evaluation framework to focus onthe goals. Intersectoral actions\u2014going beyond the ministry of health Signicant potential exists for intersectoral synergies in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. Roads andtransport are vital for health services, especially for reduc-ing maternal mortality. But it is not just physical infra-structure that matters.Also important are the availability oftransportation and the affordability of its use. 115Transport and roads are complementary to health services.A 10-yearstudy in Rajasthan, India, found that better roads andtransport helped women reach referral facilities, but manywomen died anyway because there were no correspondingimprovements at household and facility levels. 116 Improved hygiene (hand-washing) and sanitation (using latrines, safely disposing of children's stools) are at least asimportant as drinking water quality in shaping health out-comes, specically on reducing diarrhea and associatedchild mortality. 117Constructing water supply and sanita- tion facilities is not enough to improve health outcomes\u2014sustained human behavior change must accompany theinfrastructure investment. In collaboration with other sec-tors, the health sector can develop public health promo-tion and education strategies and implement them incollaboration with agencies that plan, develop, and managewater resources.The health sector can also work with theprivate sector to manufacture, distribute, and promoteaffordable in-home water purication solutions and safestorage vessels\u2014and advocate for water, sanitation, andhygiene interventions in poverty-reduction strategies.Indoor air pollution is caused by the use of low-cost, traditional energy sources, such as coal and biomass (woodand cow dung) for cooking and heating, the main sourceof energy for about 3.5 billion people. Indoor air pollutionis a major risk factor for pneumonia and associated deathsin children and for lung cancer in women who risk expo-sure during cooking. Projects in China, Guatemala, andIndia are under way to improve access to efcient andaffordable energy sources through local design, manufac-turing, and dissemination of low-cost technologies, mod-ern fuel alternatives, and renewable energy solutions. 118 The community-based project in China was initiated bythe health sector, troubled by the leveling off of child mor-tality reductions among the rural poor. Agricultural policies and practices influence food prices, farm incomes, diet diversity and quality, and house-hold food security. Policies that focus on women's accessto land, training, and agricultural inputs; on their roles inproduction; and on their income from agriculture aremore likely to have a positive impact on nutrition thanpolicies that do not specically focus on women, particu-larly if combined with other strategies, such as women'seducation and behavior change. 119,120 Financing additional spending for the goals\u2014in a sustainable way Additional health spending will be required in many countries to accelerate progress toward the health goals.But how should this extra spending be nanced? Encouraging risk-pooling and private spending Health spending can be broken down into private (out-of-pocket expenditures and private insurance), public(expenditures nanced out of general revenues and socialinsurance contributions), and external sources (develop-ment assistance). Private spending absorbs a larger share of income in poorer countries. In low-income countries it absorbs alarger share of GDP , on average, than domesticallynanced public spending. And in low-income and lowermiddle-income countries, private spending invariablymeans out-of-pocket expenditures, not private insur-ance. 50This leaves many near-poor households heavily exposed to the risk of impoverishing health expenses.Therisk is clearly greater the poorer the country, since poorercountries tend to have larger shares of poor people. 121A country's private share of health spending in GDP maynot in practice be related to its per capita income. But onpoverty-reduction grounds, there are good reasons to wishthat it were. Governments thus have a major role to play inhelping shape effective risk-pooling mechanisms. 16|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthGetting governments to spend what they can afford Government spending as a share of GDP is higher in richer countries. But at any given per capita income, thereis a surprising amount of variation across countries in theshare of GDP allocated to government health programs.Countries that appear able to spend similar shares of GDPon government health programs end up spending quitedifferent amounts. How can extra domestic resources be mobilized where countries are spending less than they can afford to?Domestically nanced government health spending comesfrom general revenues, social insurance contributions, orboth. The amount of general revenues flowing into thehealth sector is the product of the amount of general (taxand nontax**) revenues collected by the government (thegeneral revenue share) and the share of general revenuesallocated to the health sector (the health share of govern-ment spending). 122Low government health spending could be due to either or both being low. In poorer coun-tries both shares are typically lower than they are in richercountries. But there are differences across countries thatcannot be explained by per capita income alone. Countries need to ascertain whether their low spending is due to unduly low general revenues or to unduly lowallocations to health and explore ways of making appro-priate adjustments. Bolivia managed to raise its generalrevenue share in the 1990s, as the result of a sustainedreform process begun in 1983.The health sector there hasbeen one of the beneciaries of this growth of tax rev-enues: government health spending as a share of GDPgrew at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent in the 1990s. 123 Raising domestic resources takes time. This does not mean, though, that countries that can apparently afford tospend more out of their own resources should not beencouraged to start the process. Development agencieshave a role to play here\u2014by providing technical supportof tax reform, helping develop government commitmentto health in public expenditure allocations, and providingnancial assistance, both to ease the adjustment costs andto provide support while the gap between current andaffordable spending is being closed. Recognizing the limits of development assistance Ofcial development assistance tends to account for alarger share of government health spending in poorercountries. Development assistance for health is especiallyimportant in Sub-Saharan Africa: in all countries in theregion, external funding exceeded 35 percent of totalhealth expenditures in 2000. 124 Development assistance is not, however, without its drawbacks.There is no assurance that development assis-tance to the health sector will continue to grow. Manydonors require that assistance be kept in parallel budgetsoutside the ministries of nance, which eliminates thepossibility of appropriate planning and targeting ofexpenditures. Such off-budget expenditures make itimpossible to properly target resources to particular inter-ventions, geographic locations, or population groups.Y etsuch targeting may be essential to improving the impactof expenditures on outcomes and the probability ofreaching the health goals. Last and most important, com-mitments of expenditures in health must be permanent,implying that any external nancing must at some pointbe substituted by additional domestic revenues or expen-diture reallocations. What the development community needs to do to rise to the challenges With the advent of new funding sources for health in 2000-02\u2014including the Gates Foundation; the GlobalFund to Fight AIDS,Tuberculosis and Malaria; the specialU.S. nancing for HIV/AIDS; and the use of World BankInternational Development Association (IDA) grants\u2014development assistance to health from all external sourcesrose from an average of $6.4 billion in 1997-99 to about$8.1 billion in 2002. What has this money achieved inrecent years? Can it be spent in a way that will achieve agreater impact on the Millennium Development Goals?What are some of the lessons that can be carried forwardas the external nancing envelope expands? Learning the lessons of development assistance for health Development assistance to health works\u2014 in a good policy environment Recent research suggests that development assistance to health does lead to better health outcomes.20,21But it does not do so in countries where the policy environment ispoor. 21The productivity of aid is not a black and white issue\u2014there are gradations of good policy, and as policygets better, the productivity of aid increases.This nding,corroborated by the World Bank's experience with pro-jects, is influencing IDA allocations. The Challenges | 17**Some countries with large public sector companies, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa regions,have important nontax revenues, which can represent as much as 9 percentof GDP . Increasing revenues from this source would require consideration ofthe competitive environment in which the companies operate and the needfor reinvestment in the companies.Aid can help improve health policies\u2014 but only under certain conditions T ying aid to the adoption of policy changes through con- ditions is widely used, but recent studies cast doubt on itswisdom. 125If governments are committed to reform, con- ditions can help by enabling governments to publiclycommit to certain reforms and thereby persuade privateinvestors of their seriousness. But if governments are notcommitted to reform, conditions will not make themreform, not least because disbursements often continueeven when the conditions are not met. Donors cannotforce policies on governments, but they can help in policydesign. Donors have recently begun to use innovative nancing mechanisms to improve performance by linking disburse-ments to specic performance measures, including betterpolicies.This is the tack taken by the Global Fund to FightAIDS,Tuberculosis and Malaria and by the Global Alliancefor Vaccines and Immunization, which disburses funds tocountries using a per capita payment for each additionalchild fully vaccinated against a target schedule. Recentprogrammatic social adjustment loans to Brazil and Peruby the World Bank link the disbursement of large singletranches of funding to changes in key policies in the healthsector to improve the targeting of public spending towardthe poor. Performance-based lending is also at the heart ofthe new scheme for IDA credit buy-downs for polio. There is substantial fungibility in development assistance for health Recent research suggests that aid is fungible\u2014across sec- tors and within sectors.125This implies that when aid is earmarked for primary health services and excludes ter-tiary care, governments simply focus their resources onhealth services for the population served by public hospi-tals\u2014a wealthier, urban population in many poor coun-tries.This suggests that donors should not try to channeltheir external funding to specic programs withoutengaging in a dialogue with the government on basicchanges in the overall patterns of public spending forhealth.If these changes occur,donors may be able to trans-fer their nancial assistance to the health sector as a whole,knowing that they are likely to have a positive impact onMillennium Development Goal outcomes. The transactions costs of aid are still too high More than 20 donors involved in health\u2014including bilat-erals, multilaterals, global programs, foundations, and largeNGOs\u2014can operate in a single low-income country.Donors are starting to acknowledge that the demands onrecipient countries can be huge and that individual projectmanagement units have not made sustainable contribu-tions. Donor-funded units have sometimes run parallel tolocal structures, fostered a sense that the project staff wereaccountable to the nancier rather than the government,and redirected the most qualied human resources away from government employment toward employment indevelopment assistance agencies. There is need to enhance coordination, explicitly pool aid, and put countries in the driver seat There is a growing view that if aid is indeed fungible and earmarking imposes transaction costs on recipient coun-tries, donors should dispense with the ction that they canidentify what their money buys.This view has encouraged asearch for broader development assistance mechanisms thatrecognize the importance of the entire expenditure pro-gram. These mechanisms range from the Multi-CountryAIDS Program in Africa to sectorwide approaches in healthand Poverty Reduction Support Credits that back a broadpublic spending agenda. Several key principles are emerging: Countries, not donors, need to drive the coordination. Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and the health sec- tor analysis that feeds into them can help achievestrategic coherence. Medium-term expenditure frameworks and agree- ments that all donor funding will respect the overallspending plans and limits of the government can helpachieve nancial coherence. Donor funds are best pooled into a single account, and aid is best untied from procurement only from thedonor country. Programs have greater impact when the number of country coordination bodies is limited and when acommon reporting and progress assessment frame-work is used, with a strong focus on countries doingthe monitoring and evaluation, learning from it, andusing the information to make their programs moreeffective. Global partnerships can add value, but they involve risks The many global initiatives and partnerships in the healthsector speak different technical languages, have vastly dif-ferent resource bases, and target different risk groups. Butthey all seek to add value through a common array offunctions, including national and global coordination,strategy development and evaluation, global nancing and 18|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthdelivery mechanisms and new tools, and resource mobi- lization, social mobilization, and advocacy. Recent external evaluations of some of the major health partnerships, such as Stop TB and the GlobalAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization, suggest that thesecollaborations are adding signicant value in these areas.But several challenges call for caution in embarking onnew global partnerships for health instead of concentrat-ing on improving the effectiveness of some of the existingpartnerships. Some partnerships lack strategic focus andtry to do too much. Others fail to engage adequately withcountry processes. Partnerships can easily ignore or evenexacerbate the problems afflicting the entire health system,such as the lack of human resources for service deliveryand weaknesses in integrated monitoring and evaluation. Getting funds to the frontline Central government funds can easily leak as they movethrough the system to the periphery of the country. Andin the absence of local initiative and the right incentives,service provision can fail to reflect the views of local peo-ple. Effective development assistance for health needs tochannel technologies, ideas, nance, and technical assis-tance closer to households, health providers, and supervi-sory ofcials in ways that are consistent with nationalpolicies and amenable to monitoring and reporting.Assistance is likely to be more successful if the followingare in place: decentralized systems of duciary and technical management in the public sector nancially sound NGOs and private providers a government body equipped and charged with regulating the quality of public and private providers a balanced approach to community-driven develop- ment in health, to ensure that social fund-type nanc-ing for community health initiatives is sustainable Development assistance for health remains unpredictable Development assistance for health depends on donor bud-gets, which are subject to the usual business and politicalcycles. Assistance may go up or down yearly as a result ofdecisions by legislative bodies during budgetary processes.Further work is needed in designing mechanisms that pro-vide greater assurance of sustained long-term nancialsupport. The challenges are to overcome the factors thatresult in interruptions in long-term assistance, includingthose stemming from changes in political leadership andaid agency management that can lead to reneging on ear-lier agreements.Applying the lessons to the World Bank's work A review of recent trends and changes in the Bank's prin- cipal instruments suggests some encouraging develop-ments in the way the institution is responding to theMillennium Development Goal challenge. While muchmore needs to be done in the coming years, some positivesigns are already visible. Analyzing Millennium Development Goal trends, prospects, and challenges A study of the causes of the large interstate disparities in Millennium Development Goal outcomes in India con-cludes that the impact of additional public spending forimproved child health and nutrition would be greatest inthe poorer Indian states. 28It recommends steps to improve the efciency of public expenditures, by targeting immu-nization and community-based nutrition activities and vil-lages and districts in the poorer states, where health andnutrition indicators are the worst. In Egypt a recentMillennium Development Goal analysis also found thattargeting publicly nanced services and involving civilsociety in implementing programs and monitoringprogress for the health goals are critical for success. 126 The World Bank has collaborated with local analysts and policymakers in Africa over the past two years to conductstudies on the causes of health trends, especially among thepoorest households. Country status reports have been com-pleted for nine countries\u2014Burkina Faso, Chad, the Gambia,Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, andTanzania\u2014and are under way in several others. Helping incorporate the Millennium Development Goals in government policies and budgets The ndings of the country status reports have fed into country-led processes\u2014for the Poverty Reduction StrategyPapers and the medium-term expenditure frameworks\u2014changing key policies in the health sector and reallocatingpublic spending toward health-related services likely to havean impact on the health goals. In Mauritania the results ofthe country status report and the linked marginal budgetingfor bottlenecks exercise shaped the Poverty ReductionStrategy Paper and resulted in important policy shifts.Success in promoting policy change and increasing spend-ing for the health goals requires awareness and buy-in fromthe ministries of health and nance, a strong donor coali-tion, involvement of the International Monetary Fund inbudget discussions, high-quality technical assistance, andinformation campaigns and the mobilization of local gov-ernment and civil society. The Challenges | 19Using the goals to assess World Bank country assistance T o better align the Bank's country assistance strategies with the goals, informal assessments have been carried out inseveral regions.A portfolio ranking in Benin found that theBank's activities were weakly related to the goals. It con-cluded that the Bank needed to do more\u2014throughPoverty Reduction Support Credits and other projects\u2014tohave a substantial impact on the health-related MillenniumDevelopment Goals. 127 Bank staff in the European and Central Asia region drafted a Millennium Development Goal \"business plan,\"including a country-by-country analysis showing that of-cial data on child mortality and malnutrition are question-able and that many countries in the region are unlikely tomeet the goals for 2015.The business plan called for specialefforts to strengthen capacity for monitoring and evalua-tion, align Bank projects to support achievement of thegoals, and expand multisectoral linkages. Integrating the goals in sectorwide and programmatic instruments The goals are increasingly providing the strategic underpin- ning of Bank assistance to countries in programs in healthand multisectoral budget support.A recent health project inthe Dominican Republic used Millennium DevelopmentGoal intermediate and outcome indicators to monitorprogress. The health information system was designed tocapture data on these indicators, augmented by periodichousehold surveys. In Bolivia performance indicators for theBank-nanced health project include coverage and qualityof key child and maternal health and disease control services,as well as changes in mortality and disease incidence.Monitoring will be at the municipal and national levels,withthe involvement of civil society, to increase local participa-tion and make local politicians and health care providersmore accountable for results. Some sectorwide health opera-tions in Africa embody a strong focus on the goals. Reorienting and increasing Bank loans and grants to achieve Millennium Development Goal outcomes T o underpin national efforts to improve health out- comes\u2014through projects focused on specic diseases andpopulation groups or through broader health sectorwideapproaches and other multisectoral operations\u2014the Bankhas expanded its nancial commitments in health signi-cantly over the past four years, consistent with the statedgoal of systematically increasing health lending from $1billion in scal 2001 to $2.2 billion in scal 2005. Newlending commitments grew from $0.95 billion in scal2000 to $1.7 billion in scal 2003.An important feature in health lending is that much of it is being incorporated as health components in other sectors,such as transport,social protection,and water supply and san-itation.Of the $1.7 billion committed in scal 2003,some 44percent was in projects and programs outside the health sec-tor.This pattern is consistent with the lessons of developmentassistance, but it also raises new issues.The Bank's organiza-tional structure and incentives make it difcult to bringhealth specialists into project teams led by staff from otherelds, and a different inhouse skills mix is required to workalong these lines. Monitoring and evaluation also need to beimproved in order to assess such cross-sectoral projects. Using the Millennium Development Goals to build monitoring and evaluation capacity Effective national programs to pursue the health goals depend on intermediate indicators to track progress\u2014andon national monitoring and evaluation systems. The Bankconvened a meeting of technical experts in November 2001to review and agree on a framework of intermediate deter-minants. Those determinants were published in a bookletnow being used in identifying indicators for MillenniumDevelopment Targets in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papersand other national strategies and in developing monitoringand evaluation systems. 128 Strengthening the capacity for monitoring and evaluation is taking different forms. In Albania a monitoring and evalu-ation template has been prepared to help four ministries,including health, develop their own systems, and a special-ized advisory body on monitoring has been established. InMali a health card has been developed to give governmentofcials and the public access to a snapshot of policy actions,health service indicators, and health outcomes for the coun-try and for income groups. One of the most importantefforts to improve monitoring and evaluation for theMillennium Development Goals is in HIV/AIDS, and theWorld Bank has been asked to take the lead role in coordi-nating the support to country monitoring. Coordinating donor actions to accelerate progress toward the goals The Framework for Action to Accelerate Progress on the health, nutrition, and population Millennium DevelopmentGoals, endorsed at the high-level policy meeting in May2003 in Ottawa, Canada, holds promise for all stakeholdersin coordinating their efforts. 129An important part of this framework is building stronger national health systems as aplatform for delivering essential services to the poor inpursuit of the goals.The framework lays out common prin-ciples and describes a process for countries and donors to 20|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthwork together in expanding and improving the effectiveness of their investments in health systems. The frameworkrequires country actions, such as incorporating analysis ofMillennium Development Goal challenges and policy andfunding gaps in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers andsimplifying donor coordination arrangements. It also callsfor stronger efforts at the global level to invest in key publicgoods with multicountry benets, such as supportingresearch and development on new drugs and vaccines forAIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and documenting and shar-ing successful national efforts to achieve the goals for mal-nutrition and maternal and child health. The top issues identied in Ottawa included increasing human resource and related system capacity; improvingmanagement and strategic planning;creating efcient healthinformation systems; providing safe, affordable, and pre-dictable supplies of drugs; understanding the social and cul-tural determinants of health, illness, and care-seekingbehaviors and the related policy responses; and movingbeyond the traditional public sector service delivery modeto work with NGOs and the private sector in extending thecoverage of the interventions for core health, nutrition, andpopulation. It was decided to establish a High-Level Forumon health MDGs to review progress on health goals, tomonitor changes in donor commitments and behaviors inmoving toward better harmonization, and to act on issuesholding back progress. The rst High-Level Forum for health MDGs, held in January 2004 in Geneva, addressed several of these issues.Heads of development agencies, bilateral agencies, globalhealth initiatives, and ministers of nance and health metto informally discuss concrete actions to accelerate andmonitor progress toward the MDGs for health and nutri-tion.They agreed on actions in four areas: Resources for health and poverty reduction strategy papers . Countries should have a single process leading toone \"MDG-responsive\" Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper. Participants agreed on the importance ofincorporating explicit reference to progress towardthe MDGs in joint assessments of Poverty ReductionStrategies. Aid effectiveness and harmonization . A working group would follow up on country pilots in budget supportfor health and link with other broader developmentefforts on harmonization, drawing out lessons on com-mon methods and instruments for health. Human resources . Participants agreed to assess expen- ditures on human resources and conduct in-depthhuman resources, and learning by doing studies inselected countries.Monitoring performance .Participants agreed on the need for a common set of intermediate indicators and measures ofpolicy and institutional performance to gauge short- andmedium-term progress toward the MDGs.

He was ill so many times withfever. He was 28 when he went away. After two months, hisrst-born went away too, and three months later our two sis-ters, Margaret and Lucy, followed them. Malaria killed all ofthem. And it keeps on going. Two weeks ago our aunt diedfrom malaria. She was ill on Tuesday, complaining about a badheadache and fever, and on Wednesday she was dead. It is notunusual like that.At least with AIDS it can take you a longtime to die, but malaria is quick. In the past three years, 25 ofmy family and friends have died in this way. My village is in the highlands. Everyone is getting malaria nowadays. Recently, we have buried 10 people from this dis-ease, including my aunt, because it is so bad. Everyone knowsmosquitoes are the danger, but the problem is that people arepoor. Even if you tell them about bednets, they are thinkingabout how they will eat. Nobody uses nets. Instead we buildres in our places to try to keep the mosquitoes out withsmoke. But we still get infected.When the fever comes, it's bet-ter to nd the doctor quickly and think about how to pay later.It can force you to sell a cow sometimes, or maybe the doctorwill take some hens or a sheep. But sometimes the medicinedoes not work well, so maybe it is better just to pray. Me, I am worried about my wife and my second-born, Marcy.They are always complaining of fever.I have taken them tohospital, and they have taken different medicines, but still theyhave the headaches and the fever.What should I do? I'm worriedthat they will go away, too.And now my youngest boy, Isaac, isalso starting. He is a year old now, but it's very easy with youngchildren to see how they feel with their malaria.Their temperaturerises very quickly and they start to sweat.For myself,it comes andgoes. Last year, I was affected almost all year, so I could not workwell.The headaches were very bad.But this year,it is better.\" \u2014GEORGE OSIGA ,COBBLER ,KENYA (adapted from a supplement in the Guardian, \"Earth:Health check for a planet and its people under pressure,\" August 22,2002) The extent of premature death and ill health in the developing world is staggering. In 2000 almost 11 mil-lion children died before their fth birthday, 99 percentof them in the developing world, 4.5 million in Sub-Saharan Africa alone.An estimated 140 million childrenunder ve are underweight, almost half of them inSouth Asia. In 2001, 3 million people died fromHIV/AIDS, 99 percent of them in the developingworld.Tuberculosis claimed another 2 million lives.And515,000 women died during pregnancy or childbirth in1995, 98 percent of them in the developing world. Death and poor health on such a scale are matters of concern in their own right. But they also act as a brakeon economic development. It was these twin concernsthat led the international community to put healthrmly at the center of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals when adopting them in 2001.Health, interventions, poverty, and people The Kenyan cobbler in the opening story records the deaths of no fewer than 25 family members and friendsover three years\u2014deaths that are far from atypical. Almost 11 million children died before their fth birthday in 2000. 1Less than 1 percent of these deaths (79,000) occurred in high-income countries, com-pared with 42 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa, 35 per-cent in South Asia, and 13 percent in East Asia. Of the estimated 140 million children under the age of ve who are underweight, almost half (65 million)are in South Asia. In 1998 an estimated 843 million people were consid- ered to be undernourished on the basis of their foodintake. 2 Of the 3 million people who died from HIV/AIDS in 2001,3almost all (99 percent) were in the developing world\u201473 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Tuberculosis claimed 2 million lives, with the epi- demic worsening during economic and social crises. In 1995, 515,000 women died during pregnancy or childbirth: 1,000 in the industrial world, 252,000 inSub-Saharan Africa. 1 Death, disease, and malnutrition on this scale are matters for con-cern in their own right \u2014the rst theme of this report. As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen put it,\"Health is among themost important conditions of human life and a criticallysignicant constituent of human capabilities which wehave reason to value.\" 4Put another way, being poor is not simply about having too little money. T o be poor, as the2001 World Development Report: Attacking Poverty notes, is \"to be hungry, to lack shelter, to be sick and not cared for,to be illiterate and not schooled.\" 5 George Osiga's story illustrates a second theme of the report. For the most part, it is not the lack of effectiveinterventions that is the principal cause of the large num-ber of deaths in the developing world. It is that the coverage of preventive and treatment interventions is too low . For exam- ple, insecticide-treated nets are effective in preventingmalaria, and effective antimalarials exist for treating it.Thescope for reducing mortality by scaling up the coveragerates of effective interventions is considerable: if the utiliza-tion rates of childhood interventions were to rise from cur-rent levels to 99 percent, the number of under-ve deathsworldwide would fall by an estimated two-thirds. 6 This begs the question: why are effective interventions so little used in the developing world? The opening storypoints to one of the reasons\u2014 the close connection between health and poverty , a third theme of this report. Poverty makes people especially vulnerable to sickness. But it alsomeans they have few resources to spend on preventivemeasures and on curative care. So they are more likely tobe malnourished and to die early (box 1.1). As George's story illustrates, people's ability to work depends on their health. As long as they remain ill, theirearning capacity is reduced, and the income flow into thehousehold remains limited. George and many like him inthe developing world appear to be caught in a vicious cir-cle: their poverty keeps them from taking appropriate pre-ventive measures and seeking health care when sick.Thiskeeps them sick\u2014which keeps them in poverty. If thepoor spend their limited resources on preventing diseaseand restoring themselves to good health when they fallsick,they risk leaving themselves and their loved ones withtoo little for food and other necessities. Illness and death in a household reduce income and lead to potentially impoverishing expenses on medicalcare. In Vietnam health expenses are estimated to havepushed about 3 million people into poverty in 1993 and2.7 million in 1998. 7Voices of the Poor records the case of a 26-year-old man in Lao Cai, in the north of Vietnam.As aresult of the high health care costs of his daughter's severeillness, he moved from being the richest man in his com-munity to one of the poorest. 8 The vicious circle of ill health and poverty is evident at the country level also. With a daily per capita income of$1.17 (purchasing power parity of $5.60) in 2000, it ishardly surprising that coverage levels of key preventive andtreatment interventions are so low in low-income coun-tries. 9Barely 40 percent of the births in low-income coun- tries take place with the assistance of a medically trainedperson. Barely 60 percent of children receive DPT3 immu-nization.And only a third of infectious patients with tuber-culosis are using effective treatment. These low coveragerates translate into high rates of child and maternal mortal-ity and low levels of nutrition.That, in turn, acts as a brakeon economic growth and contributes to income poverty.Children are less likely to be in school if ill and malnour-ished, and they learn less when they are in school. Theirproductivity in later life is reduced as a result. A recentstudy estimates that $1 invested in an early child nutritionprogram in the Philippines would yield at least a $3 returnin higher earnings thanks to better educational outcomes. 10 But children require teachers to learn, and in some parts ofAfrica deaths from HIV/AIDS are making a major dent inthe stock of teachers\u2014Zambia now loses half as manyteachers as it trains to HIV/AIDS. 11 Illness and malnutrition reduce the productivity of current workers, too\u2014as well as the hours they can 26|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBackdrop to the Millennium Development Goals | 27020406080100120140160180 Tuberculosis mortality per 100,000 populationAIDS mortality per 100,000 populationMaternal mortality per 10,000 live birthsUnder-five mortality per 1,000 live birthsChild malnutrition per 100 populationRate/ratio Poorest 25% of world's population 2nd poorest 25% of world's population 2nd richest 25% of world's population Richest 25% of world's populationThe distribution of malnutrition and mortality between poor and rich countries is unequal Source: References 21-23. Between the world's poorest and richest people are large differ- ences in the risk of premature death and malnutrition. Box gure1 lines countries up by their per capita income and divides theworld's population into four equal groups based on the per capitaincome of the country they live in\u2014the world's poorest quarter,the world's second poorest quarter, and so on.The gure does notcapture the fact that people within countries vary in terms of percapita income and mortality risks. But box gure 2 does. (TheBox 1.1 Worlds apart: The poor die earlier scales of the denominators for the rates and ratios were chosen toensure that each gradient is visible.) The under-ve mortality rate among the poorest quarter of the world's population is 10 times that of the richest quarter (boxgure 1). The gure for tuberculosis mortality is only slightlylower.The gure for maternal mortality is 20 times that of therichest quarter. Within countries too, gaps exist\u2014and persist\u2014between the rich and the poor, as box gure 2 shows. 14,15 020406080100120140160 Bolivia Egypt IndonesiaUnder-five mortality rate per 1,000 live births Poorest 20% of children 2nd poorest 20% of children Middle 20% of children 2nd richest 20% of children Richest 20% of childrenPoor children die earlier than other children Source: Reference 14. spend working.A recent study from Indonesia finds that the loss of the ability to undertake a typical activity ofdaily living leads to a loss of earnings equivalent to 10percent of average earnings, while a loss of ability toundertake any activity of daily living wipes out earningsaltogether. 12The effects of poor health and mortality show up in macroeconomic aggregates: health anddemographic variables have been estimated to accountfor as much as half the difference in growth ratesbetween Africa and the rest of the world between 1965and 1990. 13Low rates of economic growth and low ini- tial per capita incomes translate into low coverage of keyinterventions and high rates of mortality and malnutri-tion.And so the cycle goes on. George Osiga's story draws attention to a fourth theme of the report: interventions are not dropped like manna from heaven; they are demanded by people and delivered by people . Householdsdecide whether to use mosquito nets or build res, whether to seek treatment when fever comes or simply to pray. Iftreatment is sought, it is a health provider who makes thediagnosis and delivers the care. Households and providers arefallible, and their knowledge and skills are often lacking.Patients often request inappropriate drugs and tests in themistaken belief that they are appropriate.And providers oftenknowingly administer or prescribe them, since they have anancial incentive to do so.This contributes to drug resis-tance,to poverty,and in the extreme to death. Providers can also be ill informed, lacking even rudi- mentary diagnostic skills. In a survey in Burundi in 1992only 2 percent of children with diarrhea taken to a healthfacility were correctly diagnosed, and of these only 13percent were correctly rehydrated. 16Households need not always be ignorant of health matters, and providerscan acquire the appropriate skills. In Vietnam in 1997, 78percent of children seeking care for diarrhea were cor- rectly assessed, and of those 67 percent were correctlyrehydrated. 16Vietnam is also one of the few high-burden countries that have already surpassed global targets for2005 for tuberculosis treatment and cure. This report argues for better understanding of what prompts households to engage in preventive activities andto seek care when sick\u2014and what makes some providersbut not others deliver good-quality care. Poor householdsand poor countries can break out of the vicious circlelinking poor health and poverty. Improving knowledge isone avenue. Lowering prices and other barriers to usingeffective interventions is another. Sri Lanka started toachieve dramatic reductions in its maternal mortality ratioas far back as the 1930s, when it was extremely poor. 17 The exercise of understanding the factors behind house- hold and provider behavior has to be done in the contextof the health system, but it also has to go beyond the healthsystem. It has to be done in the context of governmentpolicies for the health sector, but also for other sectors.Andit has to be done in the context of development assistanceand international initiatives and partnerships. Health gets on the international community's radar screen\u2014and the Millennium Development Goals are born In the 1990s the international community recognized the importance of health in development. In a period whenofcial development assistance (ODA) was declining,development assistance to health rose\u2014in real terms. 18It also doubled as a share of International DevelopmentAssociation (IDA) disbursements,which in turn accountedfor a larger share of ODA (27 percent in 1996-98, up from25 percent in 1990-92).* The 1990s saw a growing clamor in the industrial world over debt in the developing world, fueled in no small mea-sure by a perception that interest payments were constrain-ing government health expenditures in developingcountries. 19The enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative was explicitly geared to channeling freedresources into the health and other social sectors. 20The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was introduced fordeveloping country governments seeking debt relief orconcessional IDA loans to set out their plans for ghtingpoverty on all fronts, including health. The 1990s also saw the development of major new global health initiatives and partnerships, including UNAIDS, theGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the StopTB Partnership, Roll Back Malaria, the Global Fund toFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and most recentlythe Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (box 1.2).Thescale of philanthropic involvement in international healthalso increased, with the launch of the Bill and MelindaGates Foundation and the Packard Foundation and thegreater attention to global health issues by such establishedfoundations as the Rockefeller Foundation. These initia-tives brought new funds to the ght against disease, death,and malnutrition in the developing world\u2014as well as newideas, new energy, and new coordination challenges andmechanisms. With the 1990s drawing to a close, the international community decided that even more needed to be done toaddress the array of development challenges facing thepoor. In September 2001 at the Millennium Summit, 147heads of states endorsed the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. Later, at the UN General Assembly, the heads ofstate of all 189 UN member states adopted the goals. The rest of the report This report focuses on the Millennium DevelopmentGoals, which all governments have agreed on. Other healthoutcomes are equally or even more important in manycountries, especially in countries going through the demo-graphic, epidemiological, and nutritional transitions andthose in which noncommunicable disease and injury con-tribute signicantly to the burden of disease.The focus inthis report is on outcomes,on households,on health systemconstraints and public health functions, and on investmentsin improving policies and institutions.The agenda is rele-vant for all countries, whether their targets are the Millen-nium Development Targets, other national and subnationaltargets, or some combination of the two.All countries havean interest in monitoring progress using national andcontext-specic intermediate indicators, in buying betterresults with their limited resources, and in acceleratingprogress toward their goals. Chapter 2 sets out the Millennium Development Goals for health and assesses progress to date andprospects of achieving the goals. Chapter 3 argues that where progress has been slow, the reason is not a lack of effective interventions butinadequate use of existing interventions. Chapter 4 introduces the report's second part (chapters 5-10). It argues that low coverage rates partly reflectthe low levels of government health spending but morefundamentally the numerous policy and institutionalweaknesses across the entire health system. 28|The Millennium Development Goals for Health* The International Development Association, part of the World Bank Group, provides loans to the world's poorest countries at zero interest with agrace period of 10 years and maturities of 35-40 years. Chapter 5 shows that additional government health spending would accelerate progress toward the healthMillennium Development Goals only in countrieswith relatively good policies and institutions. Chapter 6 argues that poor progress toward the goals reflects weak household demand for the services offormal providers and weak household capacity todeliver key home-based interventions. Chapter 7 argues that slow progress also reflects the inefciency and unresponsiveness of provider organi-zations, which reflects poor management and weakaccountability to the public. Chapter 8 discusses the role of input markets in holding back progress toward the Millennium DevelopmentGoals, examining human resource shortages, inadequateskills, and unaffordable and often inappropriate drugs. Chapter 9 argues that many countries have a weak public health infrastructure that leaves core publichealth functions uncovered. Chapter 10 discusses the role of the World Bank and issues of interagency coordination and partnerships.References 1. UNICEF . 2001.

Progresshas varied across the goals, in part reflecting the differences inambitiousness. All World Bank regions except Sub-SaharanAfrica will hit the malnutrition targets, but many countries\u2014even in regions where malnutrition has fallen rapidly\u2014willnot. Progress on child survival has been insufcient to leaveany Bank region or any Sub-Saharan country on track to hitthe target, but 40 percent of Sub-Saharan countries acceleratedtheir pace of reducing child mortality in the 1990s.All but oneBank region will miss the maternal mortality target, albeit by asmaller margin than for the child mortality target.That's thesituation at \"half time\" in the 1990-2015 period for thegoals. The \"second half\" may go better. Per capita incomes are fore- cast to grow faster in all but one region (East Asia and thePacic). And reaching the targets for gender and environmentwould imply faster progress in girls' education and access to safedrinking water than in the 1990s for most regions.This impetusmay push three regions to (or close to) the maternal mortality tar-get.But it will still leave all regions well short of the child mortal-ity target and Sub-Saharan Africa well short of the malnutritiontarget. This chapter argues that the Millennium DevelopmentGoals are useful because they focus on outcomes and remind us ofwhat is achievable. What is important is to accelerate progresstoward the targets,even if the targets will not be hit.Health is prominent in the Millennium Development Goals It is a reflection of the international community's concern for health in the developing world that nearly half the goalsand targets concern\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014differentaspects of health.* Table 2.1 sets out the goals, targets, andindicators, along with key additional monitoring indicatorsrecommended by a technical consultation in 2001. 1 The rst goal explicitly aims to improve the living stan- dards of poor people.The other goals do not.It is statisticallypossible for there to be no reduction in child malnutritionamong, say, the poorest 20 percent of a population but forthe population as a whole to achieve the required 50 per-cent reduction.Achieving such a result would require a 62.5percent reduction among the top 80 percent of the popula-tion, but it is a possibility with which policymakers need tobe concerned. One bilateral aid agency recently expressedconcern over this, urging that the pursuit of the goals bedone through a propoor approach to ensure that the poorsee gains across all goals. 2This report presents new evidence on whether progress toward the health-related MillenniumDevelopment Goals has left the poor behind. There are,of course,links and interdependencies among the various goals: Nutrition has an important influence on maternal and child health, so progress toward meeting goals 1, 4, and5 is likely to be related. Nutrition also influences the severity of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, reduc-ing people's ability to ght off such diseases. Similarly,diarrhea, measles, and malaria are major influences onchildren's nutritional status (such as anemia). Successon goals 1 and 6 is thus also likely to be linked. Progress in securing access to safe water and satisfac- tory sanitation (goal 7) and on securing access toaffordable medicines (goal 8) is likely to influenceprogress toward goals 1 and 2. Progress on the health Millennium Development Goals is also likely to reflect progress on the nonhealthgoals. Early child nutrition and health, for example,affect educational outcomes for school-age children. Rapid progress on the income poverty goal would speed progress on the health goals, as would rapidprogress on the education and gender equality goals.What's the score at half time? Tracking progress toward the health goals is not straightfor-ward because of differences in how the indicators aredened, which measurement instruments are used, how fre-quently information is collected, and how much effort hasbeen invested in developing measurement systems (seeappendix B). And as with progress on anything, muchdepends on how it is measured.Are we talking about coun-tries being on track to hit the Millennium DevelopmentTargets or about how close countries come to hitting thetargets? Are we talking about the number of countries thatare on track or the number of people living in on-trackcountries? Are we talking about progress at the global level,at the level of the World Bank region, or at the level of dif-ferent income groupings of countries (low,middle,or high)?Are we talking about progress for populations as a whole orfor specic sections of the population, such as the poor?Countries may, after all, hit the Millennium DevelopmentTarget for the whole population and yet leave some groups(the poor, women, ethnic minorities) or regions behind. Prospects for meeting the malnutrition target are reasonably good Goal 1 calls for halving the proportion of people suffering from hunger between 1990 and 2015, an average annualreduction of 2.7 percent.One of the two indicators trackingprogress toward this goal is the prevalence of underweightchildren among children under ve. Five of the six Bank regions achieved population- weighted average annual reductions in underweight chil-dren of 2.7 percent or more in the 1990s (gure 2.1). Upper middle-income countries and particularly lowermiddle-income countries exceeded the target (see g-ure 2.1). Not surprisingly, then, the developing world as awhole is on track to reach the malnutrition target, havingachieved a population-weighted average annual decline of5 percent in the 1990s. More than 50 percent of the devel-oping world's population lives in an on-track country forthe malnutrition goal (gure 2.2). In East Asia and SouthAsia, the gure is more than 85 percent, and in low-income countries, the gure is 64 percent. Against this good news is some inevitable bad news. Sub-Saharan Africa saw barely any change in child malnu-trition in the 1990s. Only 17 percent of countries thereare on track to meet the malnutrition goal (gure 2.3),andonly 12 percent of people there live in an on-track coun-try. Malnutrition has been falling more slowly in low-income countries than in middle-income countries. In the 32|The Millennium Development Goals for Health* Throughout the report we interpret \"health\" broadly. For example, nutri- tion is both a key aspect of health in its own right and a key influence onother aspects of health.

Even in theregions experiencing high average annual declines in mal-nutrition, several countries have fallen short of the targetrate of 2.7 percent (gure 2.4). The East Asia and thePacic region is well on target, for example, but nearly halfthe countries there are currently off target. But thingscould have been worse. That 17 percent of Sub-Saharancountries and 20 percent of low-income countries are ontrack provides some hope for other Sub-Saharan and low-income countries. How have the poor fared in reducing malnutrition? For the 17 countries with disaggregated trend data, the averagerate of reduction of malnutrition in the 1990s was broadlysimilar for the poorest 20 percent of the population andfor the population as a whole (gure 2.5). In two coun-tries\u2014Colombia and Tanzania\u2014progress was substantiallyfaster among the very poor than among the whole popu-lation. But in several countries\u2014including Bangladesh andBolivia, often held up as examples of countries that haveimplemented propoor policies\u2014child malnutrition hasbeen falling more slowly among the very poor. Child mortality: Poor progress The targets call for a two-thirds reduction in infant andunder-ve mortality rates between 1990 and 2015, anaverage reduction of 4.3 percent a year. But no Bankregion achieved a population-weighted annual averagereduction in excess of 4.3 percent in the 1990s (see gure2.1). The only countries on target are the high-incomecountries\u2014indicating that, contrary to what is oftenclaimed, large percentage reductions in child mortality are-10 -8 -6 -4 -20 East Asia and Pacific Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Middle East and North Africa South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa Developing world Low income Lower middle income Upper middle income High income: non-OECD High income: OECDAverage annual percentage change MalnutritionMaternal mortality ratio Under-five mortality rate Figure 2.1 Progress on malnutrition, under- ve mortality, and maternal mortality, by region andincome Source: References 12, 13, and 14.0 20 40 60 80 100 East Asia and Pacific Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Middle East and North Africa South Asia Sub-Saharan Africa Developing world Low income Lower middle income Upper middle income High income: non-OECD High income: OECDPercentage of people on track Under-five mortality rate Maternal mortality ratio MalnutritionFigure 2.2 People on track to hit malnutrition, under- ve mortality, and maternal mortality targets Source: References 12, 13, and 14.36|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthpossible even at low levels of mortality.The goals, which are dened in terms of percentage reductions rather thanabsolute levels, are as relevant to middle-income and high-income countries as they are to low-income countries.Asa group, the middle-income countries experienced slowerannual reductions in child mortality than the high-incomecountries, and they are off track for the child mortality tar-get.The upper middle-income countries have fared betterand are just on track, while the lower middle-incomecountries are badly off track. The widening gap between poor and better-off coun- tries is mirrored at the country level.And gaps in child mor-tality between the poor and the better off are wideningwithin countries, too. On average, the child mortality rateamong the poorest 20 percent of the population fell just halfas fast as for the whole population (gure 2.6 and appendixB).And there is more bad news. Only 16 percent of coun-tries are on track for the under-ve mortality target, andonly 22 percent of the developing world's population livesin an on-track country (see gures 2.2 and 2.3). Not a sin-gle Sub-Saharan country is on track for the child mortalitytarget.And in all regions\u2014especially Latin America and theCaribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa\u2014the rate of decline of under-ve mortalitywas greater in the 1980s than in the 1990s (gure 2.7). The news on child mortality is not all bad, however. Although mortality rates fell more rapidly, on average, in the1980s than in the 1990s, 38 percent of countries saw a fasterdecline in the 1990s than in the 1980s (gure 2.8).

Source : Reference 13.The Millennium Development Goals for Health: Progress and Prospects | 37people live in a country that accelerated its rate of decline of child mortality in the 1990s.This partly reflects the fact thatEthiopia and Uganda improved their performance in the1990s.This is also a cause for hope: despite HIV/AIDS, manySub-Saharan countries have shown themselves able to accel-erate the rate of decline of under-ve mortality. Maternal mortality: Insufcient progress The Millennium Development Goals call for a three-quarters reduction in the maternal mortality ratio between1990 and 2015, an average annual reduction of 5.4 percent. The developing world as a whole is off target, having registered an average population-weighted decline of just3.2 percent in the 1990s (see gure 2.1). Indeed, only oneregion\u2014the Middle East and North Africa\u2014is on target,though East Asia and the Pacic comes fairly close, with anestimated annual reduction of 4.5 percent. Across thedeveloping world, 17 percent of countries are on track toachieve the maternal mortality target, but there are largevariations across regions, ranging from 4 percent in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean to 64 percent in the MiddleEast and North Africa. For the developing world as awhole, 32 percent of the population lives in an on-trackcountry. But the 12 percent of countries on track in SouthAsia have a negligible share of that region's population. Communicable diseases:Too little progress The goals call for a reversal in the spread of HIV/AIDS andother communicable diseases and the beginning of adecline in incidence. According to UNAIDS, the AIDSepidemic led to the deaths of an estimated 3.1 million peo-ple in 2002, and an estimated 5 million people were livingwith HIV infection in 2002.

More accurately, a country's estimated rate of reduction is weighted by the number of births.38|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthlate 1990s\u2014but not until the prevalence of HIV reached a staggering 44 percent in urban areas. Y et there are somehopeful signs. In Uganda HIV prevalence in Kampala hasbeen declining steadily\u2014from a high of 30 percent in 1990to 11 percent in 2000\u2014and similar rates of decline havebeen observed in other areas of the country (gure 2.9). InC\u00f4te d'Ivoire HIV prevalence in major urban areas hasdeclined for the last three years for which data are available. The number of countries implementing directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) regimens fortuberculosis has increased to 155 (of 210). More than 10million patients have been diagnosed and treated in DOTSprograms since 1995. While some countries have maderapid progress in DOTS detection rates, those with hightuberculosis burdens are not increasing case detection ratestoward the 70 percent target in DOTS areas. Treatmentsuccess under DOTS for 2000 was 82 percent on averagebut substantially below average in Africa (72 percent).Figures 2.10 and 2.11 show DOTS detection and curerates for selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Will the second half go better? As the well-known stock market dictum warns\u2014and asgure 2.12 shows for under-ve mortality\u2014past perfor-mance is not necessarily a good predictor of future perfor-mance.The fact that a country is on track on the basis ofits performance in the 1990s does not guarantee that itwill maintain the required annual rate of reduction of mal-nutrition or mortality in 2000-15. It is also possible, ofcourse, that countries that are currently off track may geton track during the second half.What are the likely futuretrends in the various country-level determinants of mal-nutrition and mortality? Will countries grow more rapidlyin the new millennium than in the 1990s?

Given mortality's and malnutrition's closelinks with per capita income, 4,5the increase in growth will help push countries toward the goals, especially in Europeand Central Asia, where the change in growth is apprecia-ble. But even with faster growth, per capita incomes willrise at more than 2 percent a year in only two regions\u2014East Asia and the Pacic and South Asia. Primary education completion will probably increase more rapidly in the new millennium The Millennium Development Goals call for 100 percent completion rates at primary level, and it is likely thatEducation for All and the Fast Track Initiative will accelerate progress toward universal primary completion.The healthpayoffs to this in the second half are unclear.An increase inthe primary completion rate in 2000 will not lterthrough into higher levels of educational attainmentamong women of childbearing age until 2005 or so. Andthe rst full round of effects on under-ve mortality willnot be felt until 2010. Since only a small percentage ofbirths are to 15-year-olds, the bulk of any child survivalpayoffs associated with an increased primary completionrate in 2000 will come after 2010\u2014mostly well after 2015. Even beyond 2015 it is unlikely that increases in pri- mary school completion rates will yield appreciable payoffsin better health outcomes. A recent multicountry study 6 using Demographic and Health Surveys data found that40|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthwhile secondary education can exert a signicant effect on infant mortality, primary education does so in only a fewcountries. \u00a7This is consistent with the nding7that better- educated women achieve better health outcomes not byusing health-specic knowledge acquired at school but byusing the general numeracy and literacy skills they aretaught at school to acquire health-specic knowledge lateron in life. The implication is not that primary schoolingnecessarily has limited and possibly negligible payoffs forchild and maternal health. It is that current average levelsof quality are probably too low for girls to acquire the lit-eracy and numeracy skills needed to develop enoughhealth-specic knowledge later in life. Gender gaps in secondary education may well narrow in the new millennium One of the Millennium Development Goals is to promote gender equality and empower women. If the eliminationof gender disparities at all levels of education entails fastergrowth in secondary school completion rates among girls,it could have signicant consequences for maternal andchild health outcomes. T o achieve parity with boys by2015 in the proportion of the population 15 and olderthat completes secondary education, girls' completionrates will have to grow faster in the new millennium thanin the 1990s in most regions, especially in East and SouthAsia (gure 2.14).** Attaining the drinking water and sanitation goals would entail faster growth in access in the new millennium The Millennium Development Goals (and the Johannesburg goals) call for halving the proportion of the world's popula--3%-2%-1%0%1%2%3%4%5%6%7% East Asia and PacificEurope and Central AsiaLatin America the CaribbeanMiddle AfricaSouth AsiaSub-Saharan Africa1990 -2000 2001 -15Figure Growth rates of per capita income: actual 1990 -2000 and forecasts for 2001 -15 Source: Reference 3. \u00a7 This is consistent with cross-country econometric work undertaken for this report that nds that while female secondary education signicantly reduces maternal mortality, female primary education has no signicant effect on any Millennium Development Goal outcome (see appendix A).-13 -10 -8 -5 -30 Egypt, Arab Rep.

If drinking water access rates growlinearly at the trend rates of the 1990s, only Latin Americaand the Caribbean and the Middle East and North Africawill achieve the Millennium Development Target.T o achievethe water target, access rates would need to grow muchmore rapidly, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where accessis currently growing by 0.43 percent a year but would needto grow by 2.53 percent a year to meet the goal (gure2.15). If access rates were to grow rapidly enough to achievethe water target, the under-ve and maternal mortality ratescould fall appreciably. Even with economic growth and faster progress on the nonhealth goals, many regions will still miss many of the health targets Faster economic growth and achievement of the gender and water goals will lead to appreciable declines in mortalityand malnutrition (see appendix A for methods). In Europeand Central Asia progress on these three fronts might add asmuch as 1.4 percentage points to the rate of decline ofunder-ve mortality, 1.1 percentage points to the rate ofdecline of maternal mortality, and just under 1 percentagepoint to the annual rate of reduction of underweight (table2.2). In South Asia it might add as much as 2.6 percentagepoints to the annual rate of reduction of maternal mortality,taking the annual rate of decline from 2.9 percent to 5.5percent. These contributions will push countries andregions rmly toward the Millennium DevelopmentTargets, but for the most part they will not get them there.(An exception is maternal mortality in East Asia.) In Europeand Central Asia and South Asia the impetus is also large\u2014but for the relatively slow progress in the 1990s, the antici-pated faster economic growth and faster progress on girls'education might have allowed both regions to hit thematernal mortality targets.The picture is bleakest for under-ve mortality and for Sub-Saharan Africa. Even with theone extra percentage point annual reduction in under-vemortality driven by economic growth and achievement ofthe gender and water targets, the projected reduction ofunder-ve mortality for 2000-15 is still only 1.6 percent ayear in Sub-Saharan Africa. Why the picture may be bleaker The assumptions about future trends in the determinantsof the Millennium Development Goals used for the simu-lations conducted here are probably overly optimistic. It isassumed that progress on eliminating gender gaps in sec-ondary education and expanding access to drinking wateris fast enough to achieve the relevant target. It is alsoassumed that in the absence of faster economic growthand accelerated progress toward the gender and water0123456 East Asia and PacificEurope and Central AsiaLatin America and the CaribbeanMiddle East and North AfricaSub-Saharan AfricaSouth AsiaAverage annual growth rate (percent)Extra growth required 1995 -2000Figure 2.14 Girls catching up with boys at secondary school level \u2014growth needed in the share of female population over age 15 who havecompleted secondary education to eliminate thesecondary education gender gap Source : World Bank staff calculations and reference 13.-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 East Asia and PacificEurope and Central AsiaLatin America and the CaribbeanMiddle East and North AfricaSouth AsiaSub- Saharan AfricaAnnual growth rate (percent)Extra growth required Current growth rate Required growth rateFigure 2.15 In all but two regions access to drinking water needs to grow faster to achievethe water target Source: World Bank tabulations and reference 14.42|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthgoals, the pace of decline would continue at the rate of the 1990s. Both assumptions are probably overly optimistic.Changes in three variables found to be good predictors ofmaternal mortality are likely to be less conducive toreductions in maternal mortality in the new millenniumthan they were in the 1990s (box 2.1). In the absence offaster economic growth and accelerated progress on thenonhealth goals, maternal mortality will probably declineless quickly in the new millennium than in the 1990s. So why do the Millennium Development Goals matter? The upshot of all this:even if economic growth accelerates as Global Economic Prospects predicts, and even if progress towardthe gender and water goals is substantially accelerated, the developing world is likely to wake up on the morning ofJanuary 1, 2016, some way from the health targets; in Sub-Saharan Africa, it may be a long way. So why should theMillennium Development Goals be taken seriously? Progress can be quickened, irrespective of the targets Accelerating progress on the various health goals is critical\u2014even if the targets will not be reached. Reversing negativetrends in Sub-Saharan Africa and accelerating slow progressin other regions are vital.A key message of this report is thatprogress can be accelerated through a judicious mix ofspending and reform of both policies and institutions.Countries can set\u2014and are setting\u2014their own developmenttargets, based on the Millennium Development Goals, butTarget Current Contributions from faster Millennium growth rate growth rate economic growth and Revised Development 1990 -2015 1990 -2000 progress toward gender growth Goal Region (percent) (percent) and water targets (percent) rate (percent) East Asia and the Paci c -4.3 -2.7 America and -4.3 -3.7 0.0 Middle East and America and the Caribbean -5.4 Middle East and Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean -2.7 Middle East and the Paci c 0.2 Europe and Central Asia n.a. n.a. -1.1 -1.1 Latin America and the Caribbean n.a. n.a. 0.0 0.0 Middle East and North Not applicable (no targets for tuberculosis mortality).

Skilled attendance at delivery has a negative correlation with maternal mortality (and is an indicator used to measure theMillennium Development Goals for maternal health by itself).HIV prevalence and the resulting mortality from AIDS reducesthe exposure to death from other causes, including maternalmortality. Higher fertility rates tend to lead to higher maternalmortality ratios, because more high-risk pregnancies occur. Data for these variables for 1990, 1995, and 2001 are estimated from World Bank and UN databases.Projections for 2015 are basedon extrapolated trends in the proportion of skilled attendants in the1990s and on the assumption of gradually increasing or decreasingHIV prevalence,depending on trends in the 1990s.The general fer-tility rate is estimated from projections of the number of births andthe number of females between 15 and 49 (see appendix B). The estimated proportion of deaths of women of reproduc- tive age is applied to the overall envelope of deaths to women15-49 (estimated and projected) to obtain the number of deathsdue to maternal causes for all countries.The maternal mortalityratio is then calculated by dividing this number by the estimatedor projected number of births. Results: 1990-2001 Skilled attendance at birth rose, fertility declined, and HIV/AIDS increased (see table) in all Bank regions in the 1990s. In each casethe effect was to reduce the proportion of deaths of women ofreproductive age (PMDF). In East Asia and the Pacic, Europe andCentral Asia,and the Middle East and North Africa,the number offemale deaths also fell, reinforcing the effect of the decliningPMDF . However, the number of births fell in these three regions,putting upward pressure on the maternal mortality ratio. Thematernal mortality ratio is estimated to have fallen in all threeregions, though by a smaller percentage than the PMDF in EastAsia and the Pacic and in Europe and Central Asia.In the MiddleEast and North Africa, the decline in the number of births wassmall, and the maternal mortality ratio fell by a larger percentagethan the PMDF . In Latin America and the Caribbean, SoutheastAsia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of female deaths roseduring the 1990s, partly offsetting the fall in the PMDF . In LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and Sub-SaharanAfrica, the maternal mortality ratio is estimated to have fallen lessthan in the other three regions, in part because of relatively smallpercentage reductions in the PMDF , in part because of increases infemale deaths. Projections for 2001-15 The extrapolated trend in skilled attendance at birth will further reduce the PMDF . In some countries, however, skilled atten-The Millennium Development Goal for maternal health is to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters between1990 and 2015. In addition to the challenge of accomplishingsuch a large reduction, it will be difcult in many countries tomeasure whether the goal has been achieved or whether coun-tries have recently been making enough progress to be on trackto reach the goal.Trends in maternal mortality ratios are difcultto establish for several reasons: Measurement of maternal mortality is complex, partly because of the concept itself (a cause-specic mortality rate)and because of the rarity of maternal mortality. Estimatesbased on hospital studies suffer from a lack of representative-ness.Vital registration systems exist in many countries, butthe incompleteness of the systems is a major obstacle to theiruse in epidemiology. Household surveys using respondents'reports on the mortality of sisters have provided most of themeasured estimates of maternal mortality in developingcountries. But estimates based on this approach usually lackprecision and are typically for several years in the past. Maternal deaths are frequently misclassied. Even in coun- tries with complete coverage of deaths in vital registration,maternal deaths may be misclassied in 50 percent of cases. 8 Baseline estimates have not been collected in many coun- tries, and too few additional estimates are likely to be forth-coming. This is the most serious obstacle to monitoringtrends in maternal mortality. T o overcome the paucity of the data, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) have developed models to predictthe maternal mortality ratio from a set of variables that areknown to be related to maternal mortality. Such model-derivedestimates have been issued for 1990 and 1995, and a set of esti-mates for 2000 was released as this report was being completed.Because the models use different variables,the results of the threeexercises are not comparable, and the data cannot be used to ana-lyze trends over time. New analysis Analysis for this report uses the model developed by WHO- UNICEF for countries without vital registration data or reliablesurvey estimates to generate the 1995 estimates and extends theperiod back to 1990 and forward to 2015. 8Estimates of progress from 1990 to 2001 are made by calculating the rate of change inthe maternal mortality ratio for this period, which is then com-pared with the rate of change needed to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goal by 2015. The model estimates the proportion of deaths of women of reproductive age due to maternal causes from the following vari-ables: the proportion of births with a skilled health care worker;the general fertility rate; whether a country is in formerly social-ist Europe; whether a country is in Latin America, South or WestBox 2.1 Why the decline in maternal mortality is slowing (continued)44|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthdance has already reached high levels and has limited room for future increases; in only two regions (Latin America and theCaribbean and Southeast Asia) are attended deliveries expectedto increase at a faster rate than in the 1990s.The general fertilityrate is projected to continue to decline but at a slower rate thanin the 1990s, except in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it is projectedto decline more rapidly. HIV/AIDS prevalence will continue toincrease or decline, depending on trends in the 1990s, but therate of increase or decline will slow.The result of these projected changes in the independent vari- ables is that the PMDF will keep falling, but at a slower rate thanin the 1990s, except in Southeast Asia. Beginning in 2001, femaledeaths are expected to rise in all regions except the Middle Eastand North Africa, partly offsetting the fall in the PMDF .The neteffect is likely to be a reduction in the number of maternal deaths,but\u2014partly because of changing numbers of births\u2014the mater-nal mortality ratio is projected to decline more slowly than in the1990s, except in Latin America and the Caribbean.

In some countries the targets may be more ambitious than theMillennium Development Targets. In others realism willrequire the setting of less ambitious targets. The importantthing is that the goals be pursued and that realistic but chal-lenging targets be aimed at. Progress needs to be for everyone, not just the better off Progress toward the Millennium Development Targets isuneven within countries (see gures 2.5 and 2.6). For under-ve mortality\u2014less so for child malnutrition\u2014the poor are progressing less quickly than the better off.There is an urgentneed to ensure that countries do not progress toward theMillennium Development Goals by focusing on the low-hanging fruit, leaving the poor behind in the process.Countries and regions that are on track cannot be compla-cent. For example, the Middle East and North Africa regionhas better prospects than most for reaching the targets, but ithas some of the largest inequalities across wealth groups in theMillennium Development Indicators.The challenge there isThe Millennium Development Goals for Health: Progress and Prospects | 45to ensure that progress for the whole population is accompa- nied by narrowing the gaps between the poor and the betteroff. In Egypt in the late 1990s under-ve mortality fell morerapidly among the poor than among the whole population(see gure 2.6).That should inspire other countries to reachout to the poor in their efforts to hit the targets. Goals help focus on outcomes A major attraction of the Millennium Development Goalsis that they provide an opportunity to refocus attention inthe health sector on outcomes. Focusing on a specic setof outcomes requires choosing a limited set of corre-sponding interventions and devising strategies to ensurethat everyone who could benet from these interven-tions\u2014whether affluent or poor\u2014actually gets them.Thisapproach forces us to think about why coverage levels areoften so low and about the role of household factors,com-munity factors, and health system factors. The appropriate strategy will usually entail working at all levels.The role of households in initiating and deliver-ing care cannot be ignored. The role of communities inshaping demand and delivering interventions is often cru-cial, especially in poorer communities. Also crucial is thehealth system\u2014providers and their links to one another,the human and material inputs they have available tothem, the incentives they face, the organizational and reg-ulatory structure they work in. These factors have long been considered important in the health sector.What is different about the MillenniumDevelopment Goals is that they force us to take stock ofwhether the general debates surrounding the health sectorhave done enough to generate strategies for raising thecoverage levels of the very specic set of interventions ofrelevance to the goals. Public policy debates in the health eld too often focus on the delivery of services in health facilities.Indeed,analysis anddebate often center on the delivery of care in public facilities.The Millennium Development Goals, with their focus onoutcomes,provide a powerful reminder that such perspectivesare unduly narrow. The preventive care and treatment thathouseholds themselves deliver are important to health out-comes. The care delivered outside the public sector is alsoimportant. The Millennium Development Goals provide achance to refocus health policy on health outcomes and themajor determinants, core interventions, and delivery strate-gies\u2014and in the process to forge closer links between healthministries and other organizations that can help achieve theseoutcomes,including other government ministries. The goals remind us of what is achievable The value of the Millennium Development Goals goesbeyond getting policymakers to focus more on outcomes.True, the targets are ambitious. But if they had been set solow that developing countries could have achieved themby making progress at current rates, they would have beencriticized for being unambitious. In the 1990s, 20 percentof developing countries achieved the target 4.3 percentannual reduction in under-ve mortality. And severalcountries accelerated their annual reductions\u2014Egyptfrom 5 percent to 8.5 percent, Indonesia from about 3percent to 6.25 percent, and Bangladesh from about 3 per-cent in the 1980s to 5.5 percent in the 1990s. What this suggests is that the world should not abandon hope for the countries off track on reaching the goals.Annual rates of under-ve mortality reduction in excess of4.3 percent are possible. Some developing countries withimpressive rates of decline in the 1980s accelerated thoserates in the 1990s.A nal reason for hope: many countriesnot on track for the under-ve mortality target achieved(or were close to achieving) the required annual percent-age reduction in the 1980s (see gure 2.12). All this sug-gests that, while the targets are ambitious, they are notimpossible for the majority of developing countries.Countries off track should be encouraged to ask how theycan get on track\u2014or back on track. There is reason to hope that developing countries can make faster progress toward the other Millennium Develop-ment Goals as well. 9Several countries have achieved signi- cant reductions in maternal mortality rates. Sri Lanka, a poorcountry,reduced the maternal mortality ratio from 555 to 24per 100,000 live births between 1950 and 1995. 10Malaysia reduced its maternal mortality ratio from 500 to 21 over thesame period. And China, Egypt, and Honduras greatlyimproved maternal health outcomes in the 1990s. 11 There are encouraging examples for communicable dis- ease, too. Tuberculosis case detection under the recom-mended DOTS approach increased steadily through thelate 1990s\u2014from 7.5 percent of tuberculosis cases in 1995to 33 percent in 2001, although the scaling-up is still tooslow. Even so, large countries such as China, India,Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and the RussianFederation are all moving to scale up more quickly, withsome successes so far.The epidemiological impact of ser-vice interventions is measurable. In China the areas of 16provinces where DOTS had been applied, with WorldBank support, saw a 36 percent drop in tuberculosis preva-lence between 1990 and 2000\u2014a decline that was morethan 10 times greater than in nonintervention areas. InPeru reaching cure and case detection targets was associ-ated with a rapid decline in incidence. Sustained reductions in HIV infection have been achieved in Thailand through government efforts to pro-mote safer sex.The HIV prevalence rate has been reducedamong 13-19 year-olds in Masaka, Uganda.The spread of46|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthHIV has been contained in Senegal through a broad-based response to keep HIV prevalence low among pregnantwomen and steps to maintain a high level of condom useto prevent sexually transmitted infections among sexworkers. In the effort to roll back malaria, free treatmentand insecticide-treated nets have reduced malaria deaths inVietnam and coastal Kenya, while insecticide spraying andeffective case management have reduced malaria inAzerbaijan. The rest of the report That some countries\u2014and indeed some regions\u2014haveachieved the target rates of improvement in theMillennium Development Indicators points to the need tounderstand what has been responsible for the successesand the failures. Chapter 3 reviews the interventions avail-able for reducing child and maternal mortality, malnutri-tion, and communicable disease mortality. It argues that,together, they constitute a powerful arsenal of weapons totake on the Millennium Development Goals and that gapsin the arsenal have not, for the most part, held countriesback. The report's second part argues that the causes ofslow progress lie elsewhere\u2014in low levels of governmenthealth spending and, even more, in poor policies and insti-tutions across the entire health sector.

Othersaround her may have previously been ill with similar symptoms.She may delay seeking care due to other duties or a lack of fundsto pay for travel or consults. She may purchase medicines from adrug seller or visit a traditional healer or private physician. Shemay take drugs sporadically until her money runs out,her symp-toms remain, and she becomes further incapacitated. Her familyor neighbors may then bring her to a health center or hospital,where she sees a nurse auxiliary who may or may not refer her toa physician.The physician may charge her for an X-ray or treather with general antibiotics and send her home or refer her for afree sputum smear exam if available. Suneeta is found to have active infectious tuberculosis.The physician or nurse may tell her about tuberculosis\u2014or due to alack of interest or time, tell her only that she needs to take moremedicines.They may give her a month's worth to take home ortell her to attend the health clinic every day, even though it istwo hours to get there from her home.Worse yet, they may tellher to buy the medicines elsewhere, if no drugs are in stock. Shemight get only two of the four medicines she needs, and familymembers who may also have become infected or ill may not beseen by the health provider.The health provider may not beable to follow up to see whether Suneeta tolerated the medi-cines, took them regularly, was cured, remained ill, or died. Nofunctioning information system may be in place to register thata case was detected and treated. No supervisors visit the facilityto provide training or feedback on performance. It is not the lack of an effective intervention for tuberculosis that explains this sequence of events. It is the delays in seekingcare, the insufciently skilled or inadequately paid staff, the lackof patient and community health education, the poor supplychains, the failure to report the tuberculosis case, the lack of fol-low-up with the patient or her close contacts, and the poor super-vision in the use of the medicines that explain the risk of failedtreatment, chronic disease, or death for the patient.This situationcan also contribute to the spread of infection in the communityand to the emergence of drug-resistant organisms, which passfrom community to community and across borders. It is not a lack of interventions that is the main obstacle to faster progress toward the Millennium DevelopmentGoals\u2014it is the low levels of use, especially among thepoor, of existing effective interventions. Globally, theuse of effective interventions for child health is typicallybelow 50 percent, and in many poor countries the g-ure is much lower. Using all known interventionsappropriately\u2014achieving 99 percent coverage rates\u2014could avert 63 percent of child deaths and 74 percent ofmaternal deaths.Effective interventions exist\u2014 for all the health targets Interventions are being developed and tested for each of the Millennium Development Targets, with the potential tosubstantially reduce mortality and ill health.That is for thefuture\u2014though in some cases the not-too-distant future. What matters for the present is the impressive array of interventions now available to ght child malnutrition,child mortality, maternal mortality, and communicable dis-ease mortality (table 3.1). Not all the evidence is equallystrong, and not all interventions are equally effective. Butoverall the interventions listed in table 3.1 constitute apowerful arsenal for preventing and treating the maincauses of death and malnutrition. Take child mortality. Three causes of death\u2014diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria\u2014account for 52 percent ofdeaths worldwide (gure 3.1). Neonatal causes accountfor another 33 percent, measles for 3 percent, and AIDSfor 1 percent.

The act of immunization, not the vaccine itself, is the intervention. Case manage- ment, not medicines or vitamins, is the intervention. Counseling for safer sex is not an intervention in this sense\u2014safer sex i s. Table 3.1 Effective interventions for reducing illness, deaths, and malnutritionnearly half of under-ve deaths. For each of these causes of death, there is at least one proven effective preventiveintervention and at least one proven effective treatmentintervention (gure 3.2). And each can be delivered in alow-income setting. In most cases, there are several proveneffective interventions. For example, for diarrhea\u2014thesecond-leading cause of child deaths\u2014there are no fewerthan ve proven preventive interventions (breastfeeding,complementary feeding, hygiene and use of safe water,zinc, and vitamin A) and no fewer than three proven treat-ment interventions (oral rehydration therapy, antibiotics,and zinc). Many of these interventions can be\u2014and are\u2014delivered by households, but many are not. Similar arguments can be made for the other goals. Some interventions for maternal mortality are deliveredby the household (nutrition, family planning), but mostare not (gure 3.3).And for those delivered by households,there is typically little\u2014if any\u2014scientic evidence avail-able on impact. Because of the multiple and interrelated causes of child- hood and maternal deaths, integrated strategies, such asIntegrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) andIntegrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth(IMPAC) have been introduced in many countries.Delivery of these bundled interventions has the potentialto yield greater efciency, synergy, and impact\u2014if imple-mented on scale and not underused. Effective interventions are underused\u2014especially by the poor The proximate cause of the high rates of death and malnu- trition in the developing world is that, for one reason oranother, people do not receive the interventions that couldsave their life or make them well nourished. In upper mid-dle-income and high-income countries,90 percent of chil-dren receive diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT3)vaccinations; more than 90 percent of babies are deliveredby a medically trained person; and more than 90 percent ofpregnant women have at least one antenatal visit (g-ure 3.4). In low-income and lower middle-income coun-tries, the gures are much lower\u2014often dramatically so. InSouth Asia less than 50 percent of pregnant women receiveantenatal checkups,and only 20 percent of babies are deliv-ered by a medically trained person (gure 3.5). In somecountries less than 20 percent of children with acute respi-ratory infections are seen by a medically trained person(gure 3.6)\u2014despite the fact that pneumonia, the mostsevere respiratory infection, can be treated with an antibi-otic.The story is similar for other childhood interventionsand for interventions for other Millennium DevelopmentGoals (box 3.1). In short, there is substantial underuse ofeffective interventions in the developing world. Just as shortfalls in coverage vary across countries, they vary within countries.The poor and other deprived groupsinvariably lag behind the population in many preventive andcurative health interventions.They are less likely to receivefull basic immunization coverage (bacillus of Calmette andGuerin [BCG], measles, and DPT) (gure 3.7); to have attended by a medically trained person; or to haveat least one antenatal care visit to a medically trained person.The trends in use by wealth group are more encouraging.For the most part, the poor are making more rapid progressthan the better off, who already have high coverage rates formany interventions (see tables in appendix D). Progress hasbeen more propoor in professionally delivered interventions(skilled attendance, treatment of common childhood ill-nesses) than in home-delivered interventions (breastfeeding,timely complementary feeding, and vitamin A supplementa-tion) (gure 3.8). The underuse of effective interventions costs lives The low use of effective interventions\u2014in the developing world and among the poor\u2014translates into rates of mor-tality, morbidity, and malnutrition that are far higher thanthey need be. Take child mortality. If the use of all the proven effective childhood preventive and treatment interventions were torise from its current level to 99 percent (95 percent forbreastfeeding), the number of under-ve deaths world-wide would fall dramatically (gure 3.9). Deaths frommalaria and measles could be all but eliminated, and deathsfrom diarrhea, pneumonia, and HIV/AIDS could be dra-matically reduced. Overall, a reduction in childhooddeaths of 63 percent could be achieved by increasing cov-erage rates to 99 percent. Of these 6 million averted deaths worldwide,perhaps half would result from increased coverage of home-deliveredinterventions.* This fraction will vary according to the rela-tive importance of different causes of death. In Brazil andChina, just under half of child deaths are neonatal, 2for which the relevant effective interventions are professionallydelivered.

Part II of the reportinvestigates this question. Chapter 4 argues that a lack ofgovernment health spending is only part of the story oflow coverage rates. It makes the case that governmentsneed to improve their targeting of health spending, buteven more they need to improve their policies and theinstitutions of the health sector\u2014very broadly dened.The rest of part II shows how.Most countries have developed strategic frameworks for HIV prevention, but only a fraction of people at risk have meaning-ful access to basic prevention and treatment. Risk reduction behavior among young people Survey results indicate that condom use with nonregular part- ners is higher in urban than in rural areas and higher amongyoung men than among young women. Data also suggest thatcondom use varies considerably across countries, ranging from2 percent to 88 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this region,15-20 percent of young people report having had sexual inter-course before the age of 15, with young women reporting anearlier median age of rst sex than males. Management of sexually transmitted infections Because untreated sexually transmitted infections increase the risk of HIV transmission by several orders of magnitude, con-trol of sexually transmitted infection is a fundamental elementof effective HIV prevention. Y et from limited informationreceived, only one in four countries in Sub-Saharan Africareports that at least 50 percent of sexually transmitted infectionpatients are appropriately diagnosed, counseled, and treated. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission Four years after research indicated that a relatively inexpensive single dose of nevirapine to mother and newborn signicantlyreduced the odds of HIV transmission to the infant, preventionof mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) coverage remainsvirtually nonexistent in many heavily affected countries.Apartfrom Botswana, where coverage reached 34 percent by the endof 2002, PMTCT remains extremely low in countries hardesthit by HIV/AIDS. Antiretroviral therapy While an estimated 6 million people in low- and middle- income countries currently need antiretroviral therapy, only300,000 were obtaining such therapy by the end of 2002.Although coverage remains low in Sub-Saharan Africa,Botswana, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Uganda have made seriousefforts to increase antiretroviral therapy coverage through thepublic and private sectors. Caribbean countries report coverageof less than 1 percent. In Asia, where more than 7 million peo-ple are living with HIV/AIDS, no country has exceeded 5 per-cent coverage.

One view holds that low government health spending in the devel-oping world is the cause of poor health indicators.According tothis view, government health spending needs to be increasedsubstantially and nanced largely through development assis-tance. 1At the other extreme is the view that government health spending has little impact on health outcomes at themargin, reflecting the multitude of weak links in the chain run-ning from government spending to health outcomes. 2-4 According to this view, more government health spendingwould be unproductive; the focus should instead be onstrengthening the weak links. This chapter argues for a more nuanced view. Adding to government health budgets and scaling up proportionally allgovernment health programs has an impact on MillenniumDevelopment Goal outcomes in well-governed countries. Butthe impact of such across-the-board increases on health outcomeswould be modest, so substantial increases in spending would beneeded. Carefully targeted spending can improve MillenniumDevelopment Goal outcomes even in poorly governed countries.But policies and institutions need to be strengthened if across-the-board increases in spending are to be productive. Shaping strong policies and institutions for achieving the goals requires broad thinking, across a wide variety of policyinstruments and areas.They include those not normally consid-ered integral parts of the health sector, such as households andcommunities, and those outside the health sector, such as water,sanitation, transport, and education.The limits and returns to government health spending The impact of government spending on mortality depends in part on its impact on coverage rates\u2014and in part on theimpact of coverage rates on mortality.The case for substan-tial increases in government health spending has beenweakened by the absence of rm evidence on the rst ofthese links.It is also weakened by the failure to factor in thecontributions and resource requirements associated withchanges in other sectors (water, sanitation, roads, femaleeducation). 5 The case against extra government health spending is built on empirical evidence that shows that additional gov-ernment health spending has no perceptible impact oninfant and under-ve mortality, once other influences areheld constant. 2But this analysis has limitations. It refers simply to child mortality, not to health outcomes in gen-eral. Child mortality differs from, say, maternal mortality inthat several of the interventions aimed at children are deliv-ered by the household, while almost all interventionsaimed at mothers are delivered by professional providers. Itis unlikely that, say, maternal mortality is as unresponsive(or inelastic) to government health spending as child mor-tality is.The results are also very general: they indicate whathappens to child mortality among the population as awhole, in an average country.As a result, they hide signi-cant spending effects among specic subpopulations andspecic types of countries. Finally, the results indicate whatwould happen to child mortality if additional governmentspending were to take the form of a proportional scaling-up of all government health programs.They do not showwhat would happen if extra spending focused on specicsubpopulations or specic programs. The importance of good policies and institutions For the developing world as a whole, then, and for popula- tions as a whole, proportional scaling-up of governmenthealth programs has no perceptible impact on child mor-tality, once other influences are held constant. 2But recent evidence suggests that scaling up does make a differencefor specic subpopulations and specic types of countries. Child mortality among the poor\u2014whether the poorest 20 percent of the population or those living under $1 (or$2) a day\u2014does improve with additional governmenthealth spending. 6-8And among countries with good gov- ernance (measured by the quality of the bureaucracy),additional government health spending reduces childmortality (see the rst panel of table 4.1). 9This nding isconsistent with recent World Bank studies on aid effec-tiveness. 10,11In countries with \"good\" policies and institu- tions (strong property rights, absence of corruption, agood bureaucracy), an extra 1 percent of GDP in aid hasbeen estimated to lead to a decline in infant mortality of0.9 percent. By contrast, in countries in which policies areonly average, the impact is just 0.4 percent.Where policiesare \"bad,\" aid has no statistically signicant effect on infantmortality. These ndings are also borne out in the results of a study undertaken for this report (see table 4.1 and appen-dix A), in which the quality of policies and institutions wasmeasured by the World Bank's Country Policy andInstitutional Assessment (CPIA) Index. As policies andinstitutions improve, this index increases from 1 to a maxi-mum of 5 (gure 4.1). As the second panel of table 4.1shows, the elasticity also increases in absolute size\u2014gov-ernment spending has a larger impact on health outcomesat the margin in better-governed countries. For example,at a CPIA score of 4 (one standard deviation above themean), a 10 percent increase in the share of GDP devotedto government health spending results in a 7.2 percentdecline in the maternal mortality ratio. The elasticities in the second panel of table 4.1 reinforce the nding that across-the-board increases in governmenthealth spending have no perceptible impact on under-vemortality in poorly governed countries. But they also showsomething new: the same is true of other MillenniumDevelopment Goal outcomes. Whether the outcome isunderweight, maternal mortality, or tuberculosis mortality,in countries one standard deviation below the mean CPIAscore, across-the-board additions to government healthspending have no signicant effect. Indeed, for malnutri-tion and tuberculosis mortality, the CPIA score has to getabove the population-weighted average of 3.5 for addi-tional government health spending to have any bite. The message, then, is clear. In countries with poor gov- ernance\u2014and weak policies and institutions\u2014improve-ments need to occur in these areas if additions togovernment health budgets are to have any impact.Theseimprovements may require reforms that entail transitioncosts, which may need to be covered by governmentspending.And it may be possible to phase in the additionalgovernment health spending as these reforms are beingimplemented. But the fact remains: in these countries,extra government health spending by itself will do little, ifanything, to accelerate movement toward the MillenniumDevelopment Targets.This is why the rest of part II\u2014thebulk of the report\u2014is devoted to the difcult but oftenoverlooked question of how to shape effective policies andinstitutions in the health sector. 56|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthMore government spending in well- governed countries\u2014how large are the returns relative to the Millennium Development Goal challenge? In well-governed countries, and ones with good policies and institutions, there is scope for improving health out-comes through a proportional scaling-up of governmenthealth programs.According to the upper panel of table 4.1,extra government health spending would reduce child mor-tality in countries with above-average governance condi-tions. According to the lower panel, it would reducematernal mortality ratio in countries with above-averageCPIA scores and reduce malnutrition and tuberculosis mor-tality in countries with CPIA scores that are respectively1.00 and 1.75 standard deviations above the mean. So well-governed countries in the developing world could, in prin-ciple, accelerate progress toward the health goals simply byadding to government health budgets. But how much extramomentum could they achieve by doing so? Or to put thequestion the other way around, how much extra wouldthey need to spend to hit the Millennium DevelopmentTargets?

For example, in East Asia and the Pacic under-ve mortality fell by only 2.7 percent a year in the 1990s,so it would need to fall by 5.3 percent a year in 2000-15for the region to achieve the targeted two-thirds reductionbetween 1990 and 2015. For the maternal mortality ratio, the contribution from an additional 2.5 percentage points of growth in govern-ment health spending as a share of GDP would be sub-stantial, pushing two regions (Europe and Central Asia andSouth Asia) up to their required rates of reduction for2000-15. For malnutrition the contribution would also beappreciable but unnecessary given trends to date, except inSub-Saharan Africa, where it would be insufcient to getthe region to the target. For under-ve mortality the esti-mated contribution of extra health spending depends onthe set of elasticity estimates used. If the rst set is used,Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East andNorth Africa would hit the under-ve mortality targets ifan additional 2.5 percentage points were added to the rateof growth of government health spending as a share ofGDP . If the second set is used, the extra governmenthealth spending would have little\u2014if any\u2014impact. How much would reaching the Millennium Development Goals cost in well-governed countries? Another way of looking at the spending question is to ask how much faster government health spending as a share ofGDP would need to grow to hit the Millennium Develo-pment Targets in well-governed countries. Would suchextra growth be reasonable? Table 4.2 presents estimatesfor two scenarios\u2014one in which the expected economicgrowth materializes and the other relevant MillenniumDevelopment Goals are met, another in which growthfails to materialize and there is no acceleration in the rateof progress toward these other goals. Obviously in the sec-ond case, the costs of reaching the health goals will behigher, because the health sector cannot ride as much onthe coattails of other sectors.

Table 4.2 How far would the share of GDP devoted to government health spending need to rise in well-governed countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals? Assumes that economic growth continues at current rate and noacceleration occurs in progresstoward other MillenniumDevelopment Goals In East Asia and the Pacic the share of GDP devoted to government health spending was a little over 1.7 percentin 2000, and the share shrank at -0.2 percent a year in the1990s. If this trend were maintained, the share would beabout 1.67 percent in 2015. If economic growth is asexpected in the new millennium (a slight reduction isanticipated for East Asia and the Pacic), and the other rel-evant goals are reached, East Asia and the Pacic would hitthe underweight and maternal mortality ratio targets evenwithout additional health spending. It would, however,miss the under-ve mortality target\u2014an additional vepercentage points would need to be added to the rate ofgrowth of the government health share of GDP to hit thetarget, taking it to 3.7 percent in 2015. If there were nochange in economic growth in the new millennium andno acceleration in progress toward the other goals, the rateof growth of the government health share of GDP wouldhave to rise to 3.9 percent, more than twice the projected2015 value based on 1990s trends. For all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean the binding constraint is under-ve mortality\u2014govern-ment spending has to rise faster to hit this target than itdoes to hit the others.And the results for under-ve mor-tality may be overly optimistic, based on the elasticities inthe rst panel rather than the second. Since the second setof estimated elasticities is not statistically signicant, theextra spending required could be innite. Looking acrossthe developing world, well-governed countries couldachieve the goals if they raised the share of GDP devotedto government health spending to 4.6-5.5 percent in2015, depending on whether anticipated economicgrowth materializes and the other relevant targets are hit.This is two to three times the GDP share projected for2015 on the basis of 1990s trends. In Sub-Saharan Africa the implied increases in the GDP share going to government health programs are even lesspalatable. Even in the optimistic rst scenario, the sharewould need to rise to 12.2 percent by 2015. In the secondscenario, the required share in 2015 would be even moreunrealistic\u201416.5 percent. And this applies only to coun-tries whose quality of policies and institutions is aboveaverage. Sub-Saharan Africa has few of them: only ve of47 Sub-Saharan countries had a CPIA in 2000 of at least4. For the other Sub-Saharan countries, acceleratedprogress toward the goals will not happen through extraspending alone, however large the increases. The bottom line So, yes, in well-governed countries, additions to govern-ment health budgets will by themselves lead to reductionsin malnutrition and mortality. But the implied increases inthe share of GDP to be devoted to government healthspending are impressively large. In the few well-governedcountries in Sub-Saharan Africa, the share might need tobe nearly eight times what it is predicted to be in 2015based on current trends. In poorly governed countries,then, extra spending alone will not result in faster progresstoward the goals. In well-governed countries it will, butthe implied resource increases are unrealistically high.Thissecond group of countries faces two options: raising theproductivity of existing spending and targeting additionalspending carefully. Improving expenditure allocation and targeting It is important to be clear about what the elasticities in table 4.1 show.They are estimates of the effects at the mar-gin of adding to the government's health budget on theassumption that the additional spending will be allocatedacross programs and institutions in proportion to currentallocations. From the viewpoint of expanding healthbudgets\u2014through, say, budgetary support by externaldonors\u2014these calculations are clearly highly relevant. Buteven here they may be misleading if budget support islinked to policy changes that entail shifts in spending pat-terns or a different spending pattern for the extra spend-ing.The elasticities in table 4.1 do not tell us what healthimpacts will be achieved if, rather than making additionsto a ministry of health budget without changing the com-position of government health spending, additionalresources were instead spent in very specic and targetedways. Geographic targeting The poorest district in Lesotho receives only 20 percentof the amount the capital city receives in per capita allo-cations of public expenditures on health\u2014inequality thatis not resolved when accounting for nongovernmentalservices. In Peru per capita spending allocated throughthe regional budget (which excludes teaching hospitalallocations) is 66 percent higher in the Lima region thanin the very poor regions. 12In Bangladesh more devel- oped districts receive more per capita than less developeddistricts. 13 Resource-allocation formulas can reduce government spending gaps across regions and ensure that the poor alsobenet from government spending. But they have an ef-ciency angle too\u2014resources can be diverted from areaswhere the marginal benet is probably fairly low (high-techhospitals in the capital city) to those where the marginalbenet is likely to be high (immunization in rural areas). 60|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthSuch formulas have narrowed regional gaps in industrial countries.14In developing countries, too, they have begun to be used. Bolivia has used these formulas since 1994 aspart of its decentralization efforts\u2014and in its allocation ofnewly available Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)Initiative resources. Funds went to municipalities on a percapita basis based on poverty indicators (the poorer theindicator, the larger the per capita amount allocated), withthe mandate that municipalities spend such resources onprespecied health, education, and other social programs.The program has been associated with some fairly large\u2014and propoor\u2014improvements in maternal and child healthindicators (chapter 5). Changing the allocation of spending across levels of care Spending on health in developing countries is character-ized by a surprisingly high concentration of spending onsecondary and tertiary infrastructure and on personnel,despite low bed-occupancy rates. Armenian hospitals, forexample, receive more than 50 percent of the governmentbudget for health. Health clinics and ambulatory facili-ties\u2014according to household surveys, the preferred serviceproviders for sick people in the poorest quintile\u2014receivedjust over 20 percent of expenditures. 15This pattern is also seen in lower-income countries. In Tanzania governmentspending in hospitals accounted for about 60 percent of thebudget in 2000, compared with only 34 percent of spend-ing on preventive and primary care facilities. Recent gov-ernment efforts to change this brought the respectiveproportions to 43 percent and 48 percent in 2002. Simply reallocating the budget toward primary care need not result in higher payoffs to government healthspending in lowering child and maternal mortality andmalnutrition. 3,4In many instances service providers have failed to deliver quality care or to use resources efciently(chapter 6). So even though many key MillenniumDevelopment Goal interventions can be and are deliveredat lower levels of care, simply redirecting money towardthese facilities will not necessarily yield higher returns.The trick is to couple expenditure reallocations with mea-sures to improve the performance of primary care facilitiesand district hospitals (chapter 6) and measures to ensurethat households actually demand the relevant interven-tions (chapter 5). T argeting specic programs Programs such as Integrated Management for ChildhoodIllness and directly observed treatment, short-course(DOTS) therapy for tuberculosis are good examples ofprograms that may yield high returns to governmentspending. Both are the subject of ongoing evaluation, andearly results are encouraging.16,17A recent World Bank study18of the Millennium Development Goals in India provides further support for the idea that the way govern-ment spending is allocated across programs affects itsimpact on Millennium Development Indicators. Thereport nds that a one percentage point increase in theshare of total government health spending devoted to pub-lic health and family welfare activities (prevention and con-trol of diseases, population and family planning services,and maternal and child health programs, including immu-nization) leads to a reduction of about 0.8 infant deaths per1,000 live births. This effect\u2014estimated holding constant the amount spent per capita on all medical, public health, and familywelfare activities\u2014is more pronounced for poor states andnot statistically signicant for nonpoor states. For the poorstates, a one percentage point increase in the share of totalgovernment health expenditure on public health and fam-ily welfare is associated with a decrease of 1 infant deathper 1,000 live births. T argeting specic population groups Many countries subsidize all government health servicesfor everyone. These blanket schemes fail to target inter-ventions that give rise to externalities, but they also fail tobenet the poor disproportionately (box 5.8 in chapter 5).This is so despite the stronger equity case for subsidizingcare for the poor\u2014and the fact that the poor tend to beara disproportionate burden of child and maternal mortalityand malnutrition. (Chapter 5 provides a variety of exam-ples of programs that have successfully targeted govern-ment spending on poor and vulnerable groups, some ofwhich have been evaluated and found to have had animpact.) Using social investment funds to reach the poor Targeting resources to poor regions and provinces mayrequire nontraditional mechanisms for setting prioritiesand implementing programs. Social investment funds,which have achieved important impacts on such healthoutcomes as infant mortality rates (box 4.1), may fulllsuch a role. The returns to targeted spending from removing bottlenecks Another approach is to assess\u2014at the country level\u2014health sector impediments to faster progress, identify ways toremove them,and estimate both the costs of removing themand the likely impacts of their removal on MillenniumDevelopment Goal outcomes (box 4.2). 22Work along these lines has begun in several African countries and in India. Extra Government Health Spending Is Necessary but Not Sufcient | 6162|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 4.1 Coupling targeting with institutional innovation through social investment funds Social funds can be dened as \"agencies that nance small projects in several sectors targeted to benet a country's poor and vulnera-ble groups based on...demand generated by local groups andscreened against a set of eligibility criteria.\" 19Bolivia introduced the rst such fund in 1986, when it established the EmergencySocial Fund.International donors soon recognized the potential ofthe social fund as a channel for social investments in rural Boliviaand as an international model for community-led development. In 1991 the Bolivian social fund began concentrating on delivering social infrastructure to historically underserved areas,moving away from emergency-driven employment generation projects. It proved that this type of institution could operate toscale, bringing small infrastructure investments to vast areas ofrural Bolivia that line ministries had been unable to reach becauseof their weak capacity to execute projects. Providing nancing tocommunities rather than implementing projects itself, the socialfund rapidly absorbed a large share of public investment. The concept spread quickly, as other countries sought to ease the social impact of economic crises and increase investment inunderserved areas. Now established in most countries in LatinAmerica, social funds have spread to Africa, the Middle East,Eastern Europe, and Asia. By May 2001 the World Bank hadinvested about $3.5 billion in social funds through more than 98investment operations in 58 countries. These funds had alsoattracted more than $4.5 billion from other international agenciesas well as from domestic nancing from governments.Despite thesizable investments, however, the funds remain a small part ofpoverty and social protection activities in most countries, withtotal expenditures typically equal to less than 1 percent of GDP . Social funds have the following common characteristics: Second-tier agencies. Social funds do not execute projects directly. Instead, they appraise, nance, and superviseinvestments carried out by other agencies, such as localrepresentatives of line ministries, local governments, andnongovernmental organizations. Multisectoral choice of investments. Social funds typically offer implementing agencies a wide range of choices of invest-ments to be nanced in different sectors. Demand-driven investments. Social funds rely on project pro- posals submitted by a variety of local actors, including localgovernments, nongovernmental organizations, communitygroups, and others. Operational autonomy and modern management practices. Social funds reside in the public sector but operate like privaterms.They are usually granted exceptional status, either asautonomous institutions or with operational autonomyunder existing ministries.A recent evaluation 20of social funds was carried out in six countries: Armenia, Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, andZambia.Among other specic objectives, the study evaluated thedegree to which social fund interventions reach poor areas andpoor households and affect living standards (as measured by edu-cation and health outcomes).The study used panel data on pro-ject beneciaries and comparison groups, applying severalevaluation methodologies. The results of the study are interesting because they reveal better targeting (especially in Peru) and positive health impacts(especially in Bolivia).The geographic distribution of social fundexpenditures was propoor in all countries studied, with poor dis-tricts receiving more per capita than wealthier districts and thevery poorest districts receiving shares exceeding their shares ofthe population. The high levels of investment in some of thepoorest areas refute the idea that such areas are systematicallyincapable of accessing resources from demand-driven programs.But in most cases the overall distribution of resources at thehousehold level was only mildly progressive. Positive discrimina-tion toward poor households was best reached by latrine andhealth projects, with sewage projects beneting the better off. For health the research found that social fund health interven- tions had a positive impact on infrastructure quality and the avail-ability of medical equipment and furniture. Essential drugs andreplaceable medical supplies were generally more available insocial fund facilities, though all facilities had difculties securingadequate supply of essential drugs. Social fund facilities were alsoas well or better staffed than comparators. In Bolivia, perhapsbecause they went beyond simply improving infrastructure, inter-ventions in health clinics raised utilization rates and were associ-ated with substantial declines in under-ve mortality rates. 20 The results in under-ve mortality rates in Bolivia are robust, based on three alternative methodologies: propensity scorematching; changes in mortality using household surveys betweentreatment and comparison groups at two different dates (1993and 1997), also known as double differences or difference in dif-ferences methodology; and econometric analysis estimation(Cox proportional hazard function). The changes in mortalityusing double differences show a statistically signicant decline inthe percentage of children dying, from 10.3 percent in 1993 to 6percent in 1997 in the treatment group relative to an increasefrom 10.3 percent to 10.7 percent in the comparison group.Theeconometric estimates show a statistically signicant decline inunder-ve mortality, from 88.5 to 65.6 deaths per 1,000 amongchildren living in the service area of a health center that receivedsocial fund investment. Source: Reference 21.Extra Government Health Spending Is Necessary but Not Sufcient | 63In Mali key bottlenecks to supporting home-based practices and delivering both periodic and continual pro-fessional care were identied.These included poor accessto affordable commodities; the need for community-basedsupport for home-based care; poor geographical access topreventive professional vitamin Asupplementation,and antenatal care);shortages of qualiednurses and midwives; and the lack of effective third-partypayment mechanisms for the poor for continual profes-sional care. Removing these impediments at a cost of $12per capita between 2002 and 2007 could reduce under-ve mortality by 20-40 percent and maternal mortality byBox 4.2 Marginal budgeting for bottlenecks Despite extensive sector reforms, the health systems in many developing countries still fail to reach large numbers of womenand children\u2014particularly the poor and most vulnerable of thesepopulations\u2014with interventions that could signicantly reducemorbidity and mortality. Marginal budgeting for bottlenecks,recently developed by the United Nations Children's Fund, theWorld Bank, and the World Health Organization, has been testedin several countries. The tool helps policymakers and programmanagers improve the delivery of health services and interven-tions. It can help formulate medium-term national or provincialexpenditure plans as well as Poverty Reduction Strategy Creditsthat explicitly link expenditure to health Millennium Develop-ment Goals and optimally allocate newly available resources toachieve such health outcome targets. It also allows the likelyimpact of alternative options on health outcomes to be assessed toimprove the allocative efciency of government health budgets.This distinguishes it from traditional approaches of programmingand budgeting of health interventions. Marginal budgeting for bottlenecks helps answer the follow- ing questions: What are the major health systems bottlenecks\u2014\"the weakest links in the chain\"\u2014that hamper the delivery ofhealth services, and what can be done to address them? How much money is needed to achieve the expected results? How much can health outcomes be improved by removing the bottlenecks? Marginal budgeting for bottlenecks consists of three modules: bottleneck identication, costing and budgeting, and expectedimpact. Module 1: Bottleneck identication The rst module denes intervention packages according to ser- vice delivery mode: family and community-based care, popula-tion-oriented services, and individual-oriented clinical care.Current levels of coverage of these packages are estimated basedon available country data.The module then uses proxy indicatorsfrom data sources such as Demographic and Health Surveys orMultiple Indicator Cluster Surveys to identify bottlenecks thathamper expansion of coverage levels.The identication of bot-tlenecks is performed in the following ve broad categories: gapsin physical accessibility, human resources, supplies and logistics, demand and use, and technical and organizational quality. Proxy indicators are used so that each intervention package can be adequately represented by a proxy intervention, which in turnhas a proxy indicator for each corresponding constraint (or bottle-neck). Mali used the proportion of deliveries attended by trainedstaff as a proxy for use of institutional professional deliveries (ideallymeasured by proportion of deliveries attended by a professional in ahealth center or hospital).The average of the values of the proxyindicators for a bottleneck\u2014across an intervention package\u2014rep-resents the extent of the bottleneck at a particular level of servicedelivery. Based on an analysis of the realistic possibility that the bot-tleneck can be reduced in a certain time period, marginal budget-ing for bottlenecks then sets a new target for the proxy indicatorcorresponding to the bottleneck\u2014the \"new performance frontier.\" Module 2: Costing and budgeting The costing and budgeting module estimates the volume of addi- tional resources (the incremental cost) required to overcome thebottlenecks and achieving the new performance frontiers set inModule 1. It does so by costing a set of strategies or programs toaddress the bottlenecks in each intervention package. The costingmodule has six components, ve corresponding to the categories ofbottlenecks dened above.The sixth component adds the expectedcosts of needed stewardship to steer the increase in coverage levels.Itincludes costs for capacity strengthening, central supervision,research,and assistance with planning.The module can be applied todifferent regions (urban or rural,poor or rich,low or high morbidityand mortality). Such estimates can be used to assess resource alloca-tion among regions. Once the marginal costs of addressing the bot-tlenecks within a certain time period have been identied, they canbe spread over the time period using different budget formats. Module 3: Expected impact The expected impact module uses an epidemiometric model to calculate the potential impact on the Millennium DevelopmentGoals if the new performance frontiers for coverage levels ofintervention packages are achieved. Providing policymakers withan idea of the consequences of their choices, it can serve as abasis for policy dialogue. Source: Reference 22.40-80 percent, depending on the poverty level of the region. Cost and mortality estimates from studies such as this can be used to compute an implied elasticity of govern-ment health spending\u2014the percentage change in mortal-ity divided by the percentage change in spending. Theimplied elasticities (table 4.3) from several recent andongoing exercises in marginal budgeting for bottlenecksare considerably larger than those in table 4.1, particularlybecause the poor quality of policies and institutions inthese countries would mean elasticities in table 4.1 in thelow and possibly insignicant range. The results suggestthat in Ethiopia, spending an additional $7.32 per capitaon removing the bottlenecks identied in the marginalbudgeting for bottlenecks exercise would yield a return inlower child mortality considerably larger than what wouldbe achieved if the extra money were simply added to thegovernment's health budget. Only time\u2014and carefulmonitoring and evaluation\u2014will tell whether these esti-mates turn out to be accurate. Improving policies and institutions\u2014 and the rest of the report Without better policies and institutions, countries with low CPIA scores will not progress faster toward the MillenniumDevelopment Goals through extra government health spend-ing. What do better policies and institutions entail in thehealth sector? Health systems are very broad\u2014far broaderthan many people think. Weak policies and institutions canarise at several different points along the path from govern-ment health spending to health outcomes (gure 4.3). Part IIof the report uses this framework to tackle the difcult ques-tion of how to build stronger policies and institutions.Households are pivotal but often overlooked Households play two roles in the health system (chapter5).They are demanders of community-based and facility-based interventions, and they are deliverers of home-basedinterventions. For interventions that are\u2014or ought tobe\u2014delivered by a professional (antenatal care, the safedelivery of a newborn, immunization), the patient (or thecaregiver for a child) is crucial. He or she makes the initialcontact and plays a key part in what follows, in compli-ance, follow-up, referral, and so on. If a mother fails to rec-ognize the signs of a sick child and does not take the childto a provider, the consequences can be fatal.A recent studyin Bolivia found that 60 percent of children who diedduring the period covered by the study had never beentaken to a formal health care provider in the sicknessepisode culminating in their deaths. 23 The household's role as a deliverer of care is also cru- cial. It is mothers who breastfeed their children, and it isthey and other household members who purchase, treat,and use bednets. It is in the household that timely andappropriate complementary feeding gets provided to thegrowing child. It is the caregiver who administers oralrehydration therapy to a child with diarrhea and anti-malarials to a child with fever. Much of a child's healthis\u2014or at least can be\u2014\"produced\" in the household. Policymakers can influence households through the resources households have at their disposal, including theirknowledge of health matters, and through their influenceon community factors, by affecting both social norms andinfrastructure.All too often, however, health policy towardhouseholds is piecemeal and half-hearted, even failing toacknowledge that households are deliverers of healthinterventions. 64|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthCurrent Change in Implied elasticity Under- ve government government of under- ve Baseline mortality spending Extra spending spending mortality rate to under- ve reduction (U.S. dollars (U.S. dollars per capita government Country or state mortality rate (percent) per capita) per capita) (percent) health spending Benin 158 59 12.00 7.32 61 -0.967 Ethiopia 185 31 4.00 3.77 94 -0.329 Madagascar 142 42 5.00 3.15 63 -0.667 Mali 231 57 10.00 8.13 81 -0.701 Gujarat (India) 85 16 4.69 1.53 33 -0.490 Orissa (India) 104 29 3.15 1.80 57 -0.508 Rajasthan (India) 115 29 4.61 1.77 38 -0.755 Source: Reference 31.Table 4.3 Marginal budgeting for bottlenecks \u2014how targeting can raise government health spending elasticities Improving provider accountability Health providers in the public and private sectors play a key role in delivering interventions of relevance to the Millen-nium Development Goals.Y et they are often highly inef-cient, deliver poor-quality care, and are unresponsive topatients, reflecting in part poor management and a lack ofaccountability to the public (chapter 6). Management oftenlacks an outcome focus, a clear delineation of responsibilitiesand accountabilities within provider organizations, and aproper link between performance, compensation, and pro-motion prospects.Citizens,in their capacities as patients,oftenexert less influence over providers than they could. In theircapacities as voters, they often exert too little influence overpolicymakers, who in turn exert too limited influence overproviders.The short route of accountability\u2014from client toprovider\u2014can be strengthened through such schemes asvouchers, report cards, and citizen management groups.Thelong route\u2014from citizen to policymaker to provider organi-zation to frontline provider\u2014can be strengthened throughsuch schemes as contracting and public-private partnerships.Strengthening input markets Provider organizations do not operate in a vacuum\u2014theyrely on human resources and drugs to deliver services(chapter 7). In both \"input markets,\" problems arise.Human resource stocks are often inadequate, and drugs areoften unavailable. But there are other issues, too. Providersoften are not as competent as they need to be. In Burundiin 1992 only 2 percent of children with diarrhea taken tohealth facilities were correctly diagnosed. 24In the same facilities only 13 percent of children correctly diagnosed ashaving diarrheal disease were correctly rehydrated. 24Even if patients are initiated in correct treatment, there is noassurance that it will be administered successfully: inIndia's public sector in the early 1990s less than 45 percentof patients diagnosed with tuberculosis were successfullytreated. 25 Mistakes and poor quality care are not inevitable. One strategy for preventing such problems is training (chapter7). Another is improving program design\u2014one of theissues of core public health functions (chapter 8).

In Tanzania providers trained in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness were twiceas likely as other providers to prescribe antibiotics appro-priately; in Bolivia they were 10 times more likely to rec-ognize the danger signs of a sick child. 26,27In India in 2002 the tuberculosis treatment success rate had risen to84 percent where DOTS was implemented. 25In Thailand the HIV infection rate among 21-year-old military con-scripts dropped from 4 percent in 1993 to less than 1.5percent in 1997 through active, effective, and open pre-vention efforts launched in 1991. 28 For drugs it is not just that providers lack them in their facilities\u2014often they prescribe inappropriate ones, oftenknowingly. Even if drugs are available and prescribedappropriately, poor households and poor countries maynot be able to afford them (chapter 7). Strengthening core public health functions Strengthening core public health functions\u2014monitoring,evaluation, surveillance, regulation, social mobilization, andintersectoral action\u2014are also vital elements of a strategy forstrengthening the health sector (chapter 8). Governmentshave the responsibility for achieving and measuring progresstoward the health goals.They have to formulate the strate-gies and norms for disease prevention and control; establishthe mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation; build insti-tutions and the capacity to monitor, educate, and mobilizecommunities; and regulate and steer other sectors towardthe health goals.The recent SARS epidemic drew attentionto well-performing public health functions in preventing,controlling, and responding to new health challenges.

A woman followingthis custom gave birth to a baby girl in the forest. But severaldays later, she developed a high fever as parts of her placentawere still in her womb. Her desperate parents had asked a tra-ditional healer to pray over her and chase away the forestghosts, to no avail. When Thang heard about the woman's predicament, he issued a bold challenge to her family. If he couldn't save herlife, he would submit to their punishment, as it is forbiddenunder local laws for a strange man to see the body of a marriedwoman. Only when commune leaders witnessed and sealedThang's letter of guarantee did her family let him treat thedying woman.Thirty-year-old Thang's gambit paid off after hesaved her life.After this incident, villagers believed their physi-cian was much better than the traditional healers. When they started working in the commune, the young doctor and nurse Sep went from house to house trying to per-suade pregnant women to visit the clinic for check-ups but meta lot of resistance.However,after word spread of Thang's successin treating the woman who nearly died, gradually more womenhave come for examinations, and all the commune's womenhave learned about family planning. VIETNAM NEWS , October 19, 2003 Households matter in the health sector\u2014more than most policymakers acknowledge. Improving the healthof households is what the health sector is all about.People rely on their health in their everyday lives, andfor poor households, health is one of their major assets.Households are also key actors in the \"production\" ofhealth. Indeed, they play a dual role\u2014as users of healthservices delivered by professional providers and as pro-ducers of health through the delivery of home-basedinterventions and in their everyday health behaviors. In these roles, households are influenced by several factors. The economic resources at their disposal. Thewoman's control over these resources. The knowledgehousehold members have of health matters.The numer-acy and literacy skills that enable them to acquire newknowledge.The accessibility of health facilities.The water,sanitation, and electricity in and around the house.And soon. This chapter shows how communities shape theseinfluences, and how policymakers can modify them.T encase studies\u2014of child health, maternal mortality, andcommunicable diseases\u2014illustrate the policy options.The dual role of households in health Households play a dual role in health.* They are users of health services delivered by professional providers, and theyare producers of health through the delivery of home-based interventions and in their everyday health behaviors.Health is one of the engines of economic growth andpoverty reduction. It is also one of the fruits of economicgrowth\u2014possibly one of the most highly valued. Peoplerely on their health in their everyday lives.As an Egyptianwoman put it in Voices of the Poor, \"We face a calamity when my husband gets ill. Our life comes to a halt until herecovers and goes back to work.\" 1And households are where the activities of the health sector are ultimatelydirected. If, as in the story from Vietnam, pregnant women do not seek assistance during delivery or do not seek antenatalcare during pregnancy, health providers have their handstied: they cannot deliver care without a client.The same istrue when caregivers do not seek assistance when theirchild falls sick, when patients fail to show up for follow-upvisits or do not adhere to the provider's instructions.Weakdemand for professional services would appear to be amajor obstacle to achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. A recent study in Bolivia found that 60 percent ofchildren who died had not been taken to a formal providerin the sickness episode culminating in their death. 2And yet health planners rarely concern themselves with the factorsthat hold down demand.The assumption is that if patientsneed health care they will demand it and the professionalprovider will then deliver it. Households are also deliverers of care\u2014especially care directed at children. Mothers breastfeed their children.They and other household members purchase, treat, anduse insecticide-treated nets. Caregivers provide timelyand appropriate complementary feeding to the growingchild, wash their hands before preparing food, safely dis-pose of feces, administer oral rehydration therapy to chil-dren with diarrhea and antimalarials to children withfever. These are not incidental interventions\u2014they arehighly effective.The fact is that much of a child's healthis\u2014or could be\u2014produced in and by the householdthrough the delivery of interventions or improved house-hold or family practices (box 5.1). The same is true ofnutrition outcomes, maternal and reproductive healthoutcomes, and the prevention of other communicablediseases.T en case studies on child health, maternal mortality, and communicable diseases illustrate the policy options (tables5.1,5.2,and 5.3);these are located at the end of this chapter. Households are not islands\u2014health providers and communities help shape health outcomes Health providers and communities influence the health- related behaviors of households. They, in turn, are influ-enced\u2014often unwittingly\u2014by policymakers. Healthproviders influence households' decisions about use of ser-vices\u2014providers who deliver care that is perceived as goodquality encourage return visits and build faith in the healthsystem. Providers also influence decisions about home-based interventions, providing knowledge about whynutrition matters and how to prepare nutritious meals on avery limited budget. Through social norms and values, informal networks, and local governance structures, communities influence bothhousehold practices and the delivery of services (see chapter6 on the delivery of services). In some settings the bound-aries between households and communities are vague, espe-cially where traditional household structures have brokendown, due to civil strife, HIV/AIDS, or other circumstances.AIDS orphans are a case in point.Throughout many coun-tries in Africa the community acts as a safety net that keepsfamilies and households from destitution, providing materialrelief,labor,and emotional support that would otherwise notbe available. 4 Policymakers can also influence providers and communi- ties.They can affect what providers do, wittingly or unwit-tingly, to influence household decisions in their dual roles.Atthe community level, policymakers can encourage or dis-courage informal networks.Social norms are not immutable:governments can help make communities strong, resilient,and well informed if they choose to do so. Community-based health projects can help, improving household healthpractices and the delivery of services by professionals. Consider the World Bank's Comprehensive Rural Health Project in India's Maharashtra State.This project improvedthe health of more than 250,000 people by helping villagersorganize to address health needs and by training local villagehealth care workers. The village health workers in turnorganized women's development associations, which initi-ated credit circles to fund cooperative business enterprises.(The role of the community in service delivery is examinedin chapter 6.) Raising incomes Low income is a barrier to using most interventions\u2014pre-ventive and curative. Holding constant other influences on 70|The Millennium Development Goals for Health* The term \"household\" is used here to refer to whatever grouping of peo- ple share responsibility for health. It is not necessarily limited to biologicalrelatives (stepparents can be caregivers) and can encompass the broad arrayof kinship and household patters around the world.demand, higher incomes have been found to increase the likelihood of a pregnant woman receiving antenatal careand skilled care during delivery. 5-9Higher incomes are also associated with a higher probability of a child beingimmunized, sleeping under a treated bednet, being givenoral rehydration therapy when sick with diarrhea, andbeing taken to a formal provider when it has fever. 10-13 Income\u2014or rather the ability to buy food with moneyearned from selling commodities such as crafts\u2014is a keyfactor in determining whether households have enoughfood to eat (box 5.2).Options for raising incomes Given the link between income and the use of key healthinterventions, economic growth will be an importantsource of progress toward the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.There is no doubt that economic growth has been amajor factor underlying the long-term improvements inhealth outcomes. And there can be little doubt that sloweconomic growth has meant slow progress on health out-comes. It has been estimated, for example, that half a millionchild deaths would have been averted in Africa in 1990 Households\u2014Key but Underrated Actors in the Health Sector | 71Box 5.1 Key family practices for the production of child health and nutrition Families play a crucial role in keeping their children healthy and well nourished. A recent review summarizing the potentialimpact of family practices on child mortality, morbidity, growth,and development highlighted the key practices or behaviors thathave a signicant impact on child health outcomes. Many ofthem can be delivered by households. Breastfeed infants exclusively for six months. Breastfeeding is associated with reduced child mortality and morbidity andimproved development. Evidence suggests that breastfedinfants under two months of age are six times less likely todie of infectious diseases than infants not breastfed. And aprotective effect against diarrhea and pneumonia has beenobserved both in industrial and developing countries. Starting at six months of age, feed children freshly prepared energy- dense and nutrient-rich foods while continuing to breastfeed for twoyears or longer. Breast milk continues to be a source of key nutrients and to confer protection against infectious diseasesthroughout the second year of life. Beginning at six months,however, it is not sufcient to meet nutritional requirementsalone. Observational studies indicate that improving feedingpractices could save 800,000 lives a year. Ensure that children receive adequate amounts of micronutrients. Improving the intake of vitamin A, iron, and zinc will have asubstantial impact on mortality, morbidity, and development,particularly among poor or micronutrient-decient popula-tions.Food supplementation or fortication may be necessary. Safely dispose of feces, including children's feces, and wash hands after defecating. Hand-washing after defecating and before prepar- ing meals and feeding children can reduce diarrheal diseasesin children under ve by a median of 33 percent (range11-89 percent). And better access to sanitation is associatedwith a reduction in all causes of child mortality. Protect children in malaria-endemic areas by ensuring that they sleep under insecticide-treated nets. A meta-analysis of four African ran- domized controlled trials showed that treated bednets are asso-ciated with a 17 percent reduction in child mortality comparedwith control populations with no nets or untreated nets.Households also interact with health care providers,both in seeking care for their children once they fall sick and in following throughon care and advice delivered at health facilities. Households canhave a crucial impact on child health outcomes in several ways. T ake children as scheduled to complete a full course of immuniza- tions (BCG, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, oral polio vaccine, andmeasles) before their rst birthday. Immunizations can prevent an estimated 3 million child deaths each year. Measles vac-cination is particularly important. Recognize when sick children need treatment outside the home and seek care from appropriate providers. Studies examining factors contributing to child deaths have found that poor care-seeking is implicated in 6-70 percent of deaths. A highnumber of deaths has also been attributed to delays in care-seeking.A median of 23 percent of all fatally ill children arenever taken to a health facility. Continue to feed and offer more fluids, including breast milk, to chil- dren when they are sick. Children require more food and fluids during illness, but 16-65 percent of caregivers withholdfood, breastmilk, or fluids during illness. Randomized con-trolled trials have found that feeding nutritionally completediets to children with diarrhea increases net energy andnutrient absorption. Contrary to many beliefs, feeding locallyavailable foods does not increase the duration of diarrhea. Give sick children appropriate home treatment for infection. Uncomplicated diarrhea, malaria, and local infections canbe managed at home with efcacious treatments. Oralrehydration therapy can prevent death from watery diarrheain all but the most severe cases. Home treatment of malaria-related fevers by training mothers and increasing access totreatment can have a large impact. Follow health workers' advice about treatment, follow-up, and referral. Not adhering to treatment and referral recommendations byhealth workers leads to incomplete treatment, therapy failure,drug resistance,and the later misuse of the left-over medicines.

Although projected ratesof economic growth will leave all but one Bank region(Sub-Saharan Africa) on target for reducing the number ofpeople living on $1 a day, not one Bank region will achievethe required reduction in under-ve mortality through eco-nomic growth alone. 18Income transfer schemes provide policymakers with a means of raising the incomes of certaingroups more quickly than they would through economicgrowth. Such schemes are rarely rationalized in terms ofimproving health outcomes. There is, however, clear evi-dence that they yield health payoffs. South Africa's old-agepension provides an example.The program was originally asafety net for whites who reached retirement age withoutan adequate employment-based pension. By the end of1993 the program had been extended to all racial groups,and it has been an important source of income for non-whites.Recent research nds that the pension improved notonly the health of pension recipients but also the health ofother members of households in which resources arepooled. 19,20Among black children under the age of ve, the pension is estimated to have led to an eight-centimeterincrease in height\u2014equivalent to half a year's growth. AndSouth Africa's pension program has been found to dispro-portionately benet poorer households and householdswith children. 21 Informal solidarity schemes at the community level often substitute for formal social protection programs (box5.3).Although a lack of money is an obstacle, communitiescan take advantage of social networks to access otherwiseinaccessible health services. 22 Increasing affordability\u2014 especially for the poor The demand for health care, like the demand for almost everything else, depends on price. Out-of-pocket expendi-tures for professionally delivered health services can be sub-stantial. A normal hospital delivery in Dhaka, Bangladesh,Box 5.2 Why people can go hungry when food is plentiful Traditionally, famines have been attributed to a sudden decline in the availability of food. On the face of it this explanation seemsplausible\u2014it seems natural to assume that food supply must havedeclined sharply if people start to starve. The ofcial FamineInquiry Commission set up by the Indian government followingthe Bengal famine of 1943, which killed 3 million people, con-cluded just this\u2014that there had been a sudden decline in thesupply of rice, the staple food of the Bengali. Amartya Sen has shown why a focus on food availability can be misleading. In 1943 there was actually more food available inBengal than there had been in 1941, when no one went hungry.Sen argues that a household can be plunged into starvation ifthere is a sudden fall in the price of the commodities it sells rela-tive to the price of food.What marked 1943 as special was a sud-den rise in the price of rice. The increase left groups such asbarbers, craftspeople, shers, transport workers, and agriculturallaborers\u2014who saw no appreciable rise in the price of the things they sold\u2014with vastly worse \"terms of trade.\"They were unableto buy enough food to survive. By contrast, peasants and share-croppers (tenant farmers paying their rent with a part of theircrop) were hardly affected. What caused the rapid rise in theprice of rice in 1943? Part of the explanation lies in the fall ofBurma to the Japanese, which brought Bengal close to the warfront, causing rapid growth in military and civil construction. The moral of Sen's argument is not complicated,but it is often overlooked: food production and availability are important, butthe key issue from a hunger perspective is the capacity of differentgroups to afford whatever food is available. The use of publicemployment programs to increase the purchasing power of vul-nerable populations is a key part of a strategy against hunger. Source: References 14-16. Formal government mechanisms do not provide adequate access to health services for all people in many countries. InC\u00f4te d'Ivoire the imposition of user fees for public services inthe 1990s effectively made services inaccessible to the poorersegment of the population.Y et many poor people use modernhealth care services that have become quite expensive.Solidarity among parents, friends, and members of communitysocial networks allows them to do so. Many factors at the household level are signicantly associ- ated with using nancial solidarity to gain access to health ser-vices. The number of children born to the head of thehousehold to which the ill person belongs was found to be thestrongest. Households with no children were less likely to ben-et from nancial solidarity than households with children.Gender is also a determining factor: women have a betterchance of receiving nancial support for illness than men. Source: Reference 22.Box 5.3 Social solidarity in C\u00f4te d'Ivoirecosts the equivalent of one-quarter of the average monthly income.23A single hospital visit for a Vietnamese in the poorest fth of the population in 1998 entailed fees and drugcosts equivalent to 22 percent of that person's annual discre-tionary income (income after deducting food expenses). 24 In many cases out-of-pocket payments are informal rather than formal. In Armenia in 1999, 91 percent ofhealth service users made an informal payment to a healthcare provider. 25In Azerbaijan and Poland the gure was 78 percent. In nearly all developing countries tuberculosistreatment is ofcially provided free of charge, but indirectcosts and informal illegal payments mean that the realprices of care are much higher, and can diminish early andfull help-seeking, and increase transmission of disease. It is not just the fees paid to health providers that mat- ter\u2014households incur other money costs in using healthfacilities, including the cost of transportation. A study ofreferral and follow-up recommendations based on theIntegrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy inSudan found that only about half the children judged inneed of urgent referral were taken for such care within 24hours. The cost of getting to the hospital was the reasonmost frequently cited for not getting the needed care. 26 Voices of the Poor identies other money costs.27A young woman in Muynak, Uzbekistan, said: \"We do not go tohospital because it is necessary to bring your own bedlinen, dishes, sometimes even a bed.\" Higher money prices tend to reduce demand\u2014especially among the poor\u2014unless accompanied by improvements inservice quality. 28Cost is one of the main reasons sick people give for not seeking care. In Georgia in 1997, 94 percent ofthose who did not seek care when ill said it was the highcost that prevented them doing so. 25In China, when tuber- culosis treatment was made free,demand for it increased sig-nicantly. Informal payments deter as much as formalpayments. Informal payments were identied as one of thefactors underlying the low use of community hospitals andhealth centers in Thailand in the 1970s. 29 The demand for preventive home-delivered interven- tions also depends on price. High food prices, for example,tend to be associated with low nutrient intake and low lev-els of child survival and nutrition. 30-33The nutritional status and nutrient intake of the poor are particularly sensitive tochanges in the price of food. 31,33In a recent study, afford- ability was the most frequently cited reason for not owninga mosquito net, especially among the poorest group. 34 Reasons to reduce the price of health care Many interventions relevant to the health MillenniumDevelopment Goals are activities that generate externali-ties\u2014the benets of the intervention \"spill over\" to people Households\u2014Key but Underrated Actors in the Health Sector | 73who do not receive the intervention. For example, an individual can reduce the probability of contractingmalaria through a variety of preventive interventions,including the use of insecticide-treated nets. Once a per-son is infected, the use of an antimalarial will eliminate themalaria in the blood. By reducing the reservoir of infectedpeople, the use of both preventive and treatment interven-tions reduces the probability of mosquitoes becominginfected, which in turn reduces the probability of otherpeople being bitten by an infected mosquito. Immunization is another intervention that generates a positive externality. If person A gets vaccinated against aparticular disease, persons B and C benet through thelower risk of transmission from person A.The benets ofvaccination to person A spill over to other people. Subsi-dizing the use of such interventions makes economic sense.In the absence of subsidies the use of immunization andpreventive and treatment interventions against malariawould be at inefciently low levels. The same case can be made for the interventions listed in gure 3.2 in chapter 3 for all but two of the other lead-ing causes of childhood deaths (the exceptions are birthasphyxia and preterm delivery).And it can be made for theinterventions for tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDSand for several interventions to reduce maternal mortality. Even where there are no spillovers, an equity case can be made for reducing prices.The equity concern is likelyto relate to poorer groups, who cannot afford care at theregular price or would risk being plunged into\u2014or fur-ther into\u2014poverty if they paid for it. Price reductionsshould, in principle, target such groups. Reductions in the price of care at the point of use may also come about as part of an expansion in insurance cover-age. Risk aversion coupled with the unpredictability of ill-ness provides a motivation for pooling risks through aninsurance scheme. Revenues are collected from those atrisk\u2014or at least from a large number of them\u2014and thenused to pay the costs incurred by people if and when theyfall ill.T o counter moral hazard\u2014the tendency for insuredpeople to increase use beyond an efcient level when theyget sick\u2014insurance programs often require a copaymentby the insured at the time services are used. Such insuranceschemes range from private insurance to community-basedschemes to social security schemes and tax-nancedprograms. From blanket to targeted subsidies General revenues are often used to nance all governmenthealth services for everyone.These blanket subsidy schemessuffer from two drawbacks: they are not targeted on inter-ventions that produce externalities, and for the most part74|The Millennium Development Goals for Healththey are not well targeted on the poor.Although the poor appear to benet disproportionately in cost terms fromsubsidies to the health sector in some countries and statesin the developing world (Costa Rica, Malaysia, Kerala), thebetter off generally benet most (box 5.4, gure 5.1). 35-42 Focusing subsidies on specic interventions (immuniza- tions) or on certain groups (the poor) is in principle a moreattractive approach. Subsidies for specic interventions canbe implemented through differential charging (setting azero fee for, say, immunizations in government clinics) orthrough a system of vouchers that allows the holder toobtain the intervention free of charge from any approvedfacility. As part of a deliberate policy to improve maternal and child health, especially among the poor, the governmentof Malaysia introduced free antenatal care and home deliv-eries by government midwives. 43Bolivia's Maternal and Child Health Insurance program, introduced in 1996, cov-ers the cost of antenatal care, care received during laborand delivery, postpartum and newborn care, and manage-ment of all obstetric and newborn complications. 44The program appears to have increased the use of antenatalcare and skilled birth attendants, especially among thepoorest fth of the population, which saw nearly a dou-bling in pregnant women receiving two or more antenatalvisits (gure 5.2). In Ifakara,Tanzania, vouchers were usedto provide a 17 percent subsidy on the cost of a mosquitonet for pregnant women and children under ve. In com-bination with social marketing to increase the knowledgeand availability of bednets, these subsidies led to increaseduse of bednets. 45-47One attraction of an explicit voucher scheme is that it ensures that the provider gets paid fortreating the patient in question (box 5.5). A zero fee maysimply leave providers out of pocket, creating incentivesfor them to deliver unsubsidized interventions. The use of entitlement cards provides a means of focus- ing government subsidies on specic groups.A health cardscheme introduced in Indonesia during the crisis of the 05101520253035404550 Costa Rica 1992C\u00f4te d'Ivoire 1995 Ecuador 1998Ghana 1992Guinea 1994Indonesia 1987 Kenya 1992 (rural) Madagascar 1993Nicaragua 1998South 1994 Tanzania 1992/93Uruguay 1989 Vietnam 1993Percentage Richest 20%Figure 5.1 Who gets subsidies? Source: Reference 95.Benet-incidence analysis provides a means of seeing how dif- ferent income groups benet from public subsidies to a partic-ular sector. For each income group the analysis examines theuse of different types of facilities and the amount of subsidy pervisit (or inpatient day). The subsidy may vary across incomegroups if, say, the better off are charged higher fees. In most countries the better off benet most from govern- ment subsidies to the health sector (see gure 5.1). (Colombia,Costa Rica, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka are exceptions.) In Guineathe richest 20 percent of the population receives nearly 50 per-cent of the government's subsidy.The failure of blanket subsidiesto benet the poor disproportionately stems from the upperincome groups' above-average use of government-subsidizedservices, especially services provided by hospitals, where muchof the typical government subsidy is spent.This skewed patternof use could in principle be offset by linking user fees toincome. Although this happens in some countries, the resultsmake it clear that if it does happen, the user fee gradient is notsteep enough to offset the higher use rates among the better off.

Although coverage rates arehigher among the better off (simply because better-offchildren are more likely to be enrolled in school), the pro-gram is likely to have increased coverage more among thepoor than among the better off (many of whom werealready covered under other schemes). 49In addition to being fairly well targeted, both the Indonesia and Egyptprograms have had a considerable impact. 48,49Some recent programs\u2014especially in Latin America\u2014 have pushed these ideas even further. Rather than simplyreducing the cost of using specic interventions, these pro-grams provide cash payments to users. Receipt of cash pay-ments is linked to the use of specic interventions, andparticipation is restricted to certain groups\u2014often poormothers and their children.The experience with these pro-grams, in targeting and impact, is encouraging (box 5.6).Financial inducements\u2014including negative copayments\u2014have also been used to induce people to seek treatment ofparticular illnesses, such as tuberculosis. Empowering women It is not just a household's total income that matters\u2014women's control over its use also makes a difference tohealth outcomes. In some countries the proportion ofwomen who can decide how to spend their own money isstaggeringly small (gure 5.3). Poor women are likely to beparticularly disadvantaged. Research shows that womenwho exert relatively little control over household nancialresources are, all else constant, less likely to receive antenatalcare, less likely to have antenatal visits, and less likely to havevisits in the rst trimester of pregnancy. 57It seems likely that part of the effect of the South African pension program onchild health stems from the fact that it is paid to women(grandmothers) rather than to men. Britain decided tomake child benet payments to women rather than to menfor similar reasons. Microcredit programs aimed at poor women are thought to be one way of increasing women's nancial autonomy,and they may have increased the use of maternal health ser-vices.The evidence is somewhat mixed, but it seems likelythat the impact varies from one scheme to the next. 58Box 5.7 provides an encouraging case of women's empower-ment for better health. It is not just women's nancial independence that is important.Their ability to take decisions more generally\u2014including those that do not have major nancial conse-quences\u2014also matters. For example, in India, althoughcontraceptives are readily available in retail shops, commu-nity pressure or the disapproval of husbands often preventswomen from using them. Improving information and knowledge Affordability\u2014the price paid relative to discretionaryincome\u2014is undoubtedly one important barrier prevent-ing the use of health services. But it is not the only one.Knowledge\u2014or a lack of it\u2014is another. A lack of knowledge can result in people not seeking care when they need it, despite the absence of price barri-ers.

The vouchers entitle the sex workers to free services atone of 8-10 private, NGO, and public clinics, contracted to thevoucher agency by competitive tender. Approved providersmust follow a set treatment protocol and receive training.Contracts are reviewed after each round of voucher distribu-tion and renewed subject to an assessment of quality of care.The clinics return the vouchers to the voucher agency, whichreimburses the provider an agreed fee per voucher. Sex workers were involved in the design of the program and have opportunities to express their preferences and complaints.In each round 10 percent of recipients are interviewed abouttheir experience. Initially, sex workers reported that the gate-keepers to care (nurses and receptionists) lacked sensitivity: train-ing and sensitization of this group helped improve their attitudestoward these clients.The technical quality of care (as assessed byan examination at the outset of the project) was lower thanexpected, so training and treatment protocols were introduced. Although the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections is only slightly lower than at the beginning of the project (possiblydue to the high turnover of female sex workers), incidenceamong women who used vouchers more than once dropped by65 percent in the rst three years of the program. Following arecommendation by the sex workers, they now receive vouch-ers to give to their regular partners and clients as well. Sexworkers appreciated the fact that they could choose whichclinic to attend and made their choices on the basis of distanceand staff friendliness.The clinics reported that their main bene-t was improvement in the technical quality of their servicesand that the lessons learned were applied to all of their clients.They felt their reputation was enhanced by being contracted bya prestigious public health agency (the Central AmericanHealth Institute).

Used as a means of combating short-term poverty,cash transfer programs have been seen as vulnerable to politicalmanipulation and ill suited for promoting longer-term develop-ment. But a new generation of programs being implemented inBrazil, Colombia, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, and Nicaraguamakes receipt of the cash payments conditional on householdbehaviors that foster the development of human capital, such asusing preventive health care services or keeping young children inschool. These programs tend to be well targeted to the poor. 51The mechanisms for achieving this propoor targeting vary greatlyfrom program to program.Honduras'Family Allowance Program(PRAF-II) used a height census of all rst-grade school childrenin the country to identify municipalities at risk of malnutrition.Mexico's PROGRESA program (now Oportunidades) supple-mented geographic targeting with a household screening tool toestimate each family's standard of living from a limited numberof readily veriable indicators. Despite these differences, PRAF , PROGRESA, and Nicaragua's Social Protection Network(RPS) pilot program each managed to ensure that more than 50percent of beneciary households (more than two-thirds forHonduras and Nicaragua) were from the poorest 30 percent ofall households. These programs have in most cases invested heavily in impact evaluation, providing important lessons about their strengths andweaknesses. Most of the programs have conducted thoroughassessments of levels of development in their areas of influencebefore phasing in the program benets, allowing investigators totrack changes over time. In Nicaragua vaccination rates (complete vaccination in one- year-old children) increased by 18 percentage points. 52In Honduras opportune delivery of early infancy immunization increased by7-10 percentage points,but later vaccinations,already at high cover-age levels, were not affected. 53In Brazil,54Honduras,53Mexico,55 and Nicaragua,52health service use increased substantially.

In Indiathe poor\u2014like the better off\u2014report a large number ofshort-duration illnesses, but unlike the rich they tend to visita doctor immediately, usually a private one. 61They end up spending a large proportion of their income on these short-duration illnesses, often without getting the cause diagnosed.Box 5.6 Increasing coverage of key interventions through demand-side incentives (continued) points.In Nicaragua the poorest residents of the program area bene- ted from the intervention more than the less poor. Similar ndingswere reported in Honduras. 56 Although conditional cash transfers are a powerful way of changing the behaviors of poor families, thought needs to begiven to identifying the precise behavioral responses that need tobe fostered in order to achieve life-transforming impacts. In gen-eral, household-level incentives are probably best combined with measures that improve the quality of services offered by schoolsand clinics in poor communities.The Honduras program explic-itly aims to evaluate the synergies between these two approaches,but the impact of the supply-side interventions will not beknown until the nal evaluation round planned for 2004.

Members make claims forreimbursement after discharge, on presentation of specieddocumentation. In 1999-2000, 23,214 women participated inSEWA's medical insurance fund, in 10 districts of Gujarat. A recent study found that women making claims were poorer than the general population, suggesting that the schemewas including the poor. 59This may have been due to the embedding of the insurance plan within a scheme that targetedpoor employed women and the fact that the premium was rela-tively low (0.4 percent of median income among claimants).Insurance signicantly reduced the nancial cost of hospitaliza-tion. On average, 76 percent of hospital costs were reimbursed.Without reimbursement, hospital costs would have been \"cata-strophic\" (more than10 percent of annual household income)for 36 percent of claimants.

The poorest groups were found more likely to beprotected by the fund from catastrophic expenses.The fairly lowreimbursement ceiling limited the degree of coverage but alsoreduced \"adverse selection\" (the tendency of below-averagerisks to self-insure because premiums reflect average risks).

A poor child in Indonesia getsmore than four (often useless) drugs per diarrhea attack\u2014instead of oral rehydration therapy. Many studies nd thatfemale education is an important determinant of coverage ofkey Millennium Development Goal interventions.The useof almost all child health interventions is higher in house-holds with better-educated mothers, typically the better off(gure 5.4).The list includes intake of complementary foodsamong infants, hand-washing, appropriate disposal of exc-reta, the likelihood of receiving antenatal care, the likelihoodof choosing formal rather than traditional care, the timing ofantenatal consultations, the likelihood of a baby being deliv-ered away from home and by a trained person, the use of well-baby clinics,the likelihood of a child being immunized,the use of oral rehydration therapy, and the likelihood of acaregiver seeking care for a child with fever. 5-11,13,62-66 A lack of knowledge and skills may also result in people not getting the full health gain from inputs they have avail-able to them and use. Many women, for example, do notknow that piped water often requires further puricationand that hand-washing confers much of the health benetof piped water. It is scarcely surprising in the light of thisthat piped water in India has a substantially greater impacton the prevalence of diarrhea among the better-off andbetter-educated. 67Likewise, malnutrition is often caused\u2014 at least in part\u2014by the lack of knowledge about how andhow much to feed infants and young children. 68 In many societies, inaccurate knowledge based on tradi- tional beliefs or popular notions of modernization\u2014ofteninfluenced by mass media advertising\u2014can have a signi-cant influence on health behavior. In The Gambia poorbreastfeeding practices, including prelacteal feeding andfailure to practice exclusive breastfeeding, were found to bedue to traditional beliefs and perceptions\u2014among womenand men\u2014that bottle feeding was part of modernization. 69 Some women do not use chloroquine tablets to preventmalaria because they believe the pills induce abortion. 70 Girls'\u2014and boys'\u2014education Increasing education\u2014especially among girls\u2014is likely toyield health payoffs. But there are two caveats. First, thepayoffs will be felt on the health of the next generation ofchildren: efforts under way today to increase primaryschool completion rates among girls will not yield healthpayoffs in lower rates of under-ve mortality and childmalnutrition for at least another 5-10 years. Second, thehealth benets to increased primary education for girls\u2014inbetter health outcomes for their children\u2014may not be aslarge as previously thought.A recent study found that onceconfounding factors were taken into account, primaryeducation of the mother had a statistically signicantimpact on child survival in only 3 of 23 countries stud-ied. 71The effect appears to be especially muted in Sub- Saharan Africa.71,72 Another recent study73sheds light on how mother's education influences child health and suggests why theeffect appears to be small. It nds that it is not schooling,literacy, or numeracy that leads to better child health butthe fact that better-educated women tend, on average, tohave more health knowledge.The study also nds that girlsacquire this knowledge after leaving school, using the gen-eral literacy and numeracy skills they acquired at school. This points to the need to ensure high-quality education at the primary level. If the quality of primary education islow, girls will fail to acquire sufcient numeracy and liter-acy skills to enable them to develop the health knowledgelater in life that will help their children remain healthy.Low school quality, coupled with a more hostile healthenvironment, may be part of the reason for the small andlargely insignicant effects of primary schooling on childsurvival in Africa.Where school quality is low, it may makesense for girls and boys to be taught health education at theprimary level.Kazakhstan 1999120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Zimbabwe 1996 Turkey 1998 Namibia 1992 Peru 2000 Tanzania 1999 Colombia 2000 Ghana 1998 Zambia 2001 India 1998/99 Bolivia 1998 Malawi 2000 Cameroon 1998 Uganda 2000/01 Egypt, Arab Rep. 2000 Nicaragua 2001 Haiti 2000 Bangladesh 2000 Nepal 2001 Guatemala 1998 Mali 2001Percentage of women age 15 -49 who have completed fifth grade Population Poorest 20%Figure 5.4 Fewer poor women have completed the fth grade Source: World Bank tabulations and reference 97.Households\u2014Key but Underrated Actors in the Health Sector | 79Conveying health knowledge through the health sector Conveying health knowledge through public facilities has a long history.A recent example is the lactation managementclinic opened ve years ago at the Children's Hospital inIslamabad.The program's aims were to promote exclusivebreastfeeding\u2014rare in Pakistan\u2014until four to six monthsof age and to try to solve mothers' breastfeeding difcul-ties.Mothers receive one-on-one consultation with trainedhealth professionals on the benets and proper techniquesof exclusive breastfeeding. So far, more than 4,000 mothershave been counseled at the clinic. Preliminary results showthat 67 percent of mothers had solved their breastfeedingdifculties. More than 60 percent were exclusively breast-feeding, and another 25 percent were breastfeeding andgiving other fluids. Only 9 percent of those followed wereno longer breastfeeding. 74 This commonly used approach can be effective for those who participate, but its impact is limited by the fact thatmany people\u2014including many poor people\u2014do not usethe public sector when they fall ill.And in many cases theydo not seek care from a formal provider at all. Programsbased in the community\u2014where the conveyers of knowl-edge actively seek out target groups\u2014seem likely to have abetter chance of reaching a broader catchment group andof reaching the poor. There are several success stories here. Health workers in Brazil trained in the Integrated Management of ChildhoodIllness (IMCI) provided information and counseling athealth facilities and in the community. 75Health knowledge among mothers improved, as did feeding practices. Afteronly 18 months the nutritional status of children in the areaimproved. In India a counseling strategy was devised jointlyby government, NGOs, community volunteers, and healthworkers in eight villages in rural Haryana. 76Compared with the control areas (where no community volunteers or healthworkers were trained),the intervention areas achieved longerbreastfeeding durations, a higher quality of complementaryfeeding provided to children after six months, and increasedhand-washing before feeding children. Killing two birds with one stone\u2014social marketing Social marketing is proving a promising approach to thedesign and delivery of both health messages and products(box 5.8). It aims at promoting new or modied behav-iors that are acceptable and feasible to most people. Itactively involves key actors in designing and implement-ing activities. 68 Social marketing refers not only to the marketing of socially valuable products (contraceptives, vitamins) but tothe promotion of key behaviors. It integrates communica-tions, training, policy change, and product developmentand marketing into an overall strategy to achieve thedesired sustainable behavior change.When the focus is onproduct marketing,social marketing organizations are oftennonprot rms or associations, but the products tend to bedistributed through various for-prot outlets and NGOs. Social marketing has been applied to such diverse inter- ventions as family planning, the treatment of sexuallytransmitted infections, the use of insecticide-treated mos-quito nets, the use of soap for hand-washing, water puri-cation, improved weaning and breastfeeding practices, andincreased consumption of foods rich in vitamin A. Arecent evaluation of Tanzania's social marketing of mos-quito nets\u2014which included an element of subsidy as wellas commercial marketing\u2014found that coverage increasedsubstantially in all project areas and that socioeconomicdifferentials in net ownership narrowed. 45,46A recent review found that 12 hand-washing interventions in nine countries achieved a median reduction in diarrhea inci-dence of 35 percent. 77Many of the most successful interven- tions provided soap to mothers, explained the oral-fecal routefor disease transmission, and asked mothers to wash their handsbefore preparing food and after defecating. One promising approach to the delivery of these interven- tions is social marketing, using private-public partnerships. Suchan initiative was implemented in 1996-99 in Costa Rica, ElSalvador, and Guatemala. 78The objective was to improve hand- washing habits in order to reduce diarrheal disease among chil-dren under ve.The approach was to combine the expertise andresources of the soap industry with the facilities and resources ofgovernments to promote hand-washing with soap. Four privatesoap companies launched hand-washing campaigns in collabo-ration with the public sector. The key features of the projectwere behavioral research to identify consumers' baseline hand-washing habits; mass media coverage (both education and com-mercial); community activities through the public sector,NGOs, and foundations; and monitoring and evaluation. The private-public partnership succeeded in improving hand-washing behaviors and reducing the incidence of diar-rheal disease. The results included a 30 percent increase inhygienic hand-washing behavior in mothers, with an estimated300,000 fewer cases of diarrhea a year in poor children underve in Guatemala. Including USAID, the BASICS project, soapmanufacturers, the Pan American Health Organization, and theWorld Bank,the initiative leveraged resources and sustained theinvolvement of the private sector in social programs.

Under government leadership, messageson AIDS were broadcast frequently during the peak of theepidemic in Thailand, a key element in the campaign toreduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. 79The well-designed and culturally sensitive radio communication project in Nepalappears to have promoted positive health outcomes (box5.9). 80But many of the poor do not have access to a radio.In Bolivia, India, Morocco, and Mozambique less than 30 per-cent of the poorest fth of the population has access to themedia. The influence of providers on demand The way health services are organized (hours of operation,waiting time), their amenities and facilities, the dispositionand integrity of staff, and the cultural appropriateness ofservices all make a difference to the household's demandfor professionally delivered health care. Voices of the Poor is full of complaints by poor people about the lack of friend-liness of facilities and health service staff. 27 A woman in Los Juries,Argentina, remarked:\"Y ou go to the hospital, you have to get a number, you go tothe guard, the nurses are chatting. Y ou have to waituntil they fancy giving you a number . . .'Is the doctorhere?''No, the doctor isn't lie.\" A young woman in Muynak, Uzbekistan, said:\"We do not go to hospital because it is necessary to bring yourown bed linen, dishes, sometimes even a bed.\" In Tanzania, people complain of being treated \"worse than dogs\" by rude health staff and of being \"yelled at,told they smell bad, and called lazy and good fornothing.\" 81 People complain about corrupt health staff, who demand unofcial \"fees\" or expect small \"gifts.\" Indigenous people in Ecuador complain of staff who mistreat patients because of their lack of knowledge ofSpanish, and women everywhere are reluctant to seekcare for maternal health problems from male staff.(Making provider organizations more responsive topatients' legitimate concerns is discussed in chapter 6.) People's perceptions of the technical quality of the ser- vice they receive also matters.They may, of course, not bethe best judges of technical quality, but the fact is that per-ceptions of quality influence demand. From a policy per-spective the challenge is not just to improve the quality ofcare but to provide methods for patients to better judgewhether specic providers are delivering quality care.(These issues are also taken up in chapter 6.) Roads, transport, and accessibility Transportation systems, road infrastructure, and geographyinfluence the demand for care delivered by formalproviders\u2014through their impact on time costs, which canbe substantial. 6,30-32,82In rural Senegal only 42 percent of the population live within 30 minutes of a health facility,and 43 percent live more than an hour away. 83In rural communities, where the roads are poor and transportationunreliable, the time spent waiting for transportation maybe as great as\u2014if not greater than\u2014the time spent travel-ing to the facility.Time costs tend to be a major issue formaternal mortality\u2014health centers cannot provide essen-tial obstetrical care for a complicated delivery, and womenwould have to travel to distant hospitals to get such care. InVoices of the Poor a T ogo resident observed:\"If a woman has a difcult delivery, a traditional cloth is tied between twosticks and we carry her for seven kilometers to the healthcenter.Y ou know how long it takes to walk like that?\" 84 Road and transportation improvements support the health sector Better access to health facilities is rarely the primary goal of road rehabilitation projects\u2014or even an explicit objectiveat all. But a recent road rehabilitation project in Vietnamcut the average walking time to the local hospital by 17The Radio Communication Project uses the radio to satisfy the large unmet need for contraception in Nepal, strengthenthe quality of services and service delivery, and increase clientdemand for quality reproductive health services. It producedtwo complementary radio serial dramas, one for serviceproviders and one for community members. Educationthrough radio had a positive impact on both groups. On the client side 81 percent of the women who listened to the drama were using modern family planning, comparedwith 33 percent of the women who did not listen. Exposure toradio was also linked to greater spousal communication aboutfamily planning: 87 percent of men who listened to the serialdrama discussed family planning with their wives, comparedwith the 64 percent of men who did not listen.The programlinked positive attitudes toward family planning, discussion offamily planning with health workers, and perceived policy sup-port for family planning.

Malaysia and Sri Lanka provide free or subsi-dized transportation to hospitals in the case of emergen-cies. 43Brazil recently made major investments in ambulances to facilitate rapid referral from a primary carefacility to the hospital. In Sierra Leone focus group discus-sions made it clear that poor transportation was a majorimpediment to emergency obstetric care.So the city hospi-tal in Bo acquired a four-wheel drive vehicle and two-wayradios to link the hospital, the primary care units, and thevehicle. 86The number of women with major obstetriccomplications arriving at the hospital from the project areaincreased from 0.9 to 2.6 a month, and the case fatality ratedropped from 20 percent to 10 percent. Other options exist for increasing accessibility Upgrading and improving roads and improving trans-portation between existing facilities are options forimproving accessibility to health facilities. But otheroptions may be cheaper and more effective. Providerscould take services to clients through an outreach programusing existing facilities. Governments could construct newpublic facilities where access to existing facilities is limited.They could form partnerships with NGOs, privateBox 5.10 Argentina 's water privatization program saved young lives Public water companies serving about one-third of Argentina's municipalities and covering almost 60 percent of the populationwere transferred to private control between 1991 and 1999. 94The largest privatization was the 1993 transfer of the federal companyObras Sanitarias de la N\u00e1cion (OSN) to the private consortiumAguas Argentinas, led by the French company Lyonnaise desEaux.The concession required that 100 percent of households beconnected to piped water by the end of the 35-year concessionand 95 percent of households be connected to the sewerage sys-tem. Quality standards were also imposed for service and wastetreatment.Use fees and connection charges were regulated,and\u2014in response to protests over a large increase in the connectionfee\u2014a xed fee was introduced for all customers.The new rev-enues subsidized the cost of new connections. Aguas Argentinascut the old OSN labor force and dramatically increased invest-ment in new equipment. Connections increased and quality improved on a number of fronts, including the speed of repairs,water leakages, sewerage blockages repaired, and percentage ofclients with appropriate water pressure. A recent study assesses the impact of privatization. 94In the country as a whole and especially in Buenos Aires, access grew ata faster rate between 1991 and 1997 in municipalities in whichwater had been privatized than in municipalities in which it hadnot (see gure). The expansion of coverage was pronouncedamong poorer households.The study also nds a benecial effectof privatization on child mortality, especially for poorer munici-palities. The study nds that mortality decline was faster forcauses of death that are common among the poor (infectious,parasitic, and perinatal disease). Source: World Bank staff.

Or they could con-tract with NGOs, private providers, and communityorganizations to provide publicly nanced services tounderserved communities. (These service delivery optionsare discussed in chapter 6. The role of roads and trans-portation is discussed in chapter 8.) Water and sanitation Hygiene and the quality and quantity of drinking waterdepend on infrastructure. Hand-washing is easier if thehousehold has piped water that provides readily availablequantities of safe water.The safe disposal of feces is easier ifthe household has an improved form of sanitation (a con-nection to a public sewer or septic system, a pour-flush,ventilated-improved, or a simple pit latrine).The hygienicstorage of food is easier if the household has electricity.And so on. Not surprisingly, therefore, the availability ofplenty of water and improved sanitation are associatedwith better maternal and child health outcomes, at leastamong the better educated, even after controlling forother influences. 30,32,67,87-92 The developing world lags well behind the industrial world in water and sanitation: 1.1 billion people live with-out access to safe drinking water, and 2.4 billion live with-out access to improved sanitation. 93In the 1990s the least developed countries saw a decline in safe water coverage,and in Sub-Saharan Africa there was no increase in the cov-erage of improved sanitation. Asia lags behind in improvedsanitation, with coverage rates of 34 percent in South Asiaand 48 percent in East Asia and the Pacic. Although EastAsia and the Pacic has a higher coverage rate for safe waterthan Sub-Saharan Africa, it has the largest number of peoplewho lack access. Poor people fare especially badly: they areless likely to be connected to a network, and the sourcesthey rely on tend to be more costly per liter than the net-worked services used by the better off. 18 The issues of increasing access to water and sanitation have recently been examined in the World Bank's World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for PoorPeople. 18The report notes the need for provider organiza- tions to be accountable to policymakers,for policymakers tobe accountable to households, and for front-line providersto be accountable directly to households through usercharges and competition. Publicly managed water and sani-tation networks sometimes seem more directed at servingthe interests of politicians than households, while unregu-lated private providers have sometimes been criticized fordelivering low-quality services and ignoring the poor.Changes that improve accountability along one or more of the lines suggested by the World Development Report can improve access\u2014for everyone. In Argentina the provision ofwater services was privatized under a regulatory regime thatlaid down strict rules for quality, access, and price. Theregime was revised after pressure from the community,which saw the price rises authorized as harmful to theinterests of the poor.The World Development Report observes that \"community involvement is essential in the regulatoryprocess but has not been sufciently encouraged.\" It noteswith approval the consultations that preceded the conces-sion processes in Manila and South Africa.And it reports theresults of a survey showing how a majority of Peruvianswould have favored the privatization of the electric utility ifthe process had been transparent and tariff increases hadbeen under the control of the regulator.

In 1994 the under- ve mortality rate was 132 per 1,000 live births and the mater-nal mortality rate 390 per 100,000 live births. Both indica-tors were among the highest in the region. Use of health services was very low in the mid-1990s. In 1996 only 53 percent of pregnanciesreceived medical attention, less than 45 percent of births occurred in health facilities, and only 36 percent of women in labor were attended by skilled medical personnel. The cost of health services was considered one of the most important barriers to utilization. Policy shift Decentralization of the govern- ment structure in 1994 changed the nancing and delivery of health services. Twenty percent of government revenues were shifted to the country 's municipalities, and a certain proportion of those funds was to be earmarked for the health sector. This shift signicantly improved equity, since it was the rst time that rural municipalities were given access to these funds. Owner-ship of health facilities and responsibility for nancing of equipment and basic inputs were also decentralized to the municipalities. Management of human resources was decen-tralized to the Ministry of Health 's regional adminis- trations. In 1996 it was deter-mined that a portion of the central government 's funds should be targeted to a new special program, aimed exclu-sively at pregnant women and children under ve. The new program, called the National Maternal and Child Insurance Program, aimed to reduce maternal and child mortality rates by removing fees for key health interventions. Because it allocated funds on a per capita basis, it constituted a propoor nancing mechanism. Historically, nancing had been biased toward richer urban municipalities.Table 5.1 Reducing barriers facing households in the use of effective child health interventions In 1995 diarrhea was thecause of 45 percent of under-ve mortality in Guatemala and 20 percent in El Salvador.Hand-washing with soap canhave an important impact onthe incidence of diarrhea. But78 percent of mothers inGuatemala used inadequatehand-washing practices in1996. Lack of knowledge con-stituted an important barrier toutilization. In the late 1980s international and local research promptedkey actors in the Ministry ofHealth to emphasize that mal-nutrition imposes a severeburden on the population,that malnutrition is the under-lying cause of more than halfof the deaths in childrenunder ve, and that inadequate weight gain ratherthan nutrition was the bestearly warning sign of a sickchild.In 1980 diarrhea was the lead- ing cause of child mortality inthe world, accounting for 4.6million deaths a year. Diarrheaaccounted for 41 percent ofinfant mortality in Brazil andwas the second-leading causeof under- ve mortality, accounting for 8.5 deaths per1,000 population. Oral rehy-dration therapy wasintroduced in 1979 as an inter-vention to treat diarrhea.Consisting of the oral adminis-tration of sodium, a carbohy-drate, and water, oralrehydration therapy has beendescribed as potentially themost signi cant medical advance of the twentieth cen-tury. It was recognized in 1980that barriers to utilizationincluded lack of knowledgeand availability and accessibilityconcerns. In recognition of the severe burden of disease imposed bydiarrhea and the fact thateffective interventions such asoral rehydration therapy available, a number introduced NationalControl of Diarrheal DiseasesPrograms in the early 1980s.The programs aimed to reducemorbidity and mortality fromdehydration associated withacute diarrhea in childrenunder ve. National Control of Diarrheal Diseases Programswere operational in 35 coun-tries by 1983 and in 80 coun-tries by 1990. The experienceof Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, andthe Philippines is highlightedhere because the impact inthese countries has been evalu-ated in detail. The Central American Hand- Washing Initiative was imple-mented in Costa Rica, ElSalvador, and Guatemalabetween 1996 and 1999. Theinitiative 's goal was to reduce morbidity and mortality amongchildren under ve by promot- ing proper hand-washing withsoap.Honduras began to reform its health sector in the early1990s, with decentralization amain goal. The strategyemphasized the critical role ofcommunities in the healthsector. As part of these reformefforts, in 1994 the Ministryof Health established theIntegrated Child CareProgram as a critical compo-nent of its child health strat-egy. The program had beensuccessfully pilot tested in1992 -93. By 1994 the focus of the program had shiftedfrom interventions at the facil-ity level to interventions at thehousehold and family levelthrough increased communityparticipation. At the sametime, the malnutrition para-digm changed from diseasetreatment to health promo-tion.Households\u2014Key but Underrated Actors in the Health Sector | 87Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Philippines: Promotion of oral rehydration Costa Rica, Bolivia: National Maternal therapy in Nat ional El Salvador, Guatemala: and Child Insurance Control of Diarrheal Central American Honduras: Integrated Item Program Diseases Programs Hand-Washing Initiative Child Care Program Programmatic The program provided key action health interventions, such as antenatal and neonatal care and treatment of acute respi-ratory infections and diarrhea free of charge to pregnant mothers and children under ve on a universal basis.

Knowledge Through promotional efforts, such as public announcements on radio and television and in community charlas (informal discussions), the government succeeded in informing the public about the program and, therefore, about health services in general. Accessibility Decentralization and the pro- gram increased accessibility by bringing health services closer to the people. Increased coverage reached not only the urban rich but also rural and poor populations. In addition, since primary-level facilities had more control over funds, they were better able to stock the facilities with drugs and supplies.Table 5.1 Reducing barriers facing households in the use of effective child health interventions (continued) The program focused on mak- ing oral rehydration therapyavailable on a large scale,through primary care facilities,for example. This effort wascombined with extensive train-ing of health workers andinformation campaigns, includ-ing mass media, to inform thegeneral public about avail-ability and bene ts of oral rehydration therapy.This public-private partnership included the ministries of healthand education, soap producers,NGOs, the media, and the pro-ject facilitator, the U.S. Agencyfor International Development(through Basic Support forInstitution Child Survival andthe Environmental HealthProject). The initiative began byanalyzing the hand-washingbehavior of the targeted popu-lation. Public health messagesabout hand-washing (whenand how to wash) were thendelivered through the massmedia and NGOs, while soapproducers used their marketingskills to sell soap by promotinghand-washing with soap.The program aims to improve health by promotingthe healthy growth of chil-dren. The main focus is onmonthly growth-monitoringand promotion sessions.During the sessions, commu-nity volunteers (monitoras)weigh each child under two,assess the growth rate rela-tive to the expected weightgain, and provide counselingto the caregiver. Seriously illchildren are referred tohealth centers, where theyalso receive immunizations.Training is provided to nursesof the health centers and themonitoras. Efforts to educate the public signicantly increased knowl- edge of the availability andappropriate use of oralrehydration therapy. An evalua-tion of the National Control ofDiarrheal Diseases Program inEgypt showed that most moth-ers were able to mix oral rehy-dration therapy correctly.The main barrier to utilization addressed by the initiative wasknowledge. To increasedemand for soap, the initiativestressed the importance ofwashing hands with soap atcritical times and in appropriateways and stressed that hand-washing reduces the incidenceof diarrhea.During the counseling sessions, caregivers aretrained in how to maintain orimprove the growth of theirchildren. Key messagesinclude breastfeeding, childfeeding, care for sick children,and hygiene. Accessibility was affected by increasing the supply of oralrehydration therapy and bring-ing it closer to clients. Localproduction and imports of sup-plies increased substantially. InMexico the availability of oralrehydration salts increasedfrom 7.6 in 1984 to 79.7 mil-lion packets in 1993. Extensivepromotion of oral rehydrationtherapy in primary care facilitiesmade therapy available closerto the population.Accessibility was increased by mobile units distributing freesoap samples and by schoolprograms.Coverage of growth monitor- ing and promotion wasdeemed critical to theprogram 's success. As the government realized thatadequate coverage could notbe achieved if these serviceswere available only at thehealth-facility level, the pro-gram focuses on the house-hold and community level,bringing services closer to thepeople. The monitoras make home visits to children whowere not present during themonthly sessions and to sickchildren or children with inad-equate weight gain.88|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBrazil, Egypt, Mexico, Costa Rica, Philippines: Promotion El Salvador, Bolivia: of oral rehydration Guatemala: Central National Maternal therapy in Nati onal American and Child Insurance Control of Diarrheal Hand-Washing Honduras: Integrated Item Program Diseases Programs Initiative Child Care Program User-friendliness User-friendliness is built into the basic design of the program, sincethe development of counselingmessages is conducted throughtrials of improved practices in the homes of bene ciaries. Water and Water and sanitation is sanitation addressed indirectly through quarterly community meetings, atwhich community problems andsolutions, including water and sanitation issues, are discussed. Impact of Introduction of the program policies on resulted in substantial utilization increases in the utilization of key maternal and child health interventions, partic-ularly among the poor. Skilled birth attendance increased from 37 percent to 60 percent in nonindige-nous municipalities between 1996 and 2001; in indige-nous municipalities, it doubled, rising from 18 percent to 36 percent. Treatment of pneumonia in children also increased signicantly. Many of the people served under the program were people who had previously not used modern health services. Impact of The under- ve mortality policies on rate was reduced from 132 health outcomes in 1994 to 99 in 1998, an average annual decrease ofabout 6 percent. Maternal health also improved: by 2000 the maternal mortality rate had dropped to 234. There is evidence that these achievements are linked to the policy shift in 1994 and the improved access made possible by public health insurance. A survey on the use of public health insurance revealed that the probability that women receive skilled birth atten-dance (which increased during the time of the insur-ance) is linked to the maternal mortality rate. Source: World Bank staff.Table 5.1 Reducing barriers facing households in the use of effective child health interventions (continued) Utilization of oral rehydration ther- apy increased in all four countries.In Mexico use of oral rehydrationtherapy increased from 47.5 per-cent of all diarrhea episodes in1986 to 80.7 percent in 1993. Inthe Philippines the access rateincreased from 60 percent to 85percent between 1989 and 1992.Hand-washing behavior improved as a result of theinitiative, both in terms ofhand-washing at criticaltimes and hand-washingtechnique. A recent evalua-tion of the inGuatemala found thatinadequate hand-washingpractices of mothersdecreased 78 percentto between1996 1999.Intermediate and optimalpractices increased from 22percent to 32 percent.A recent mid-term evaluation of the program found signi cant improvements in the knowledgeand behavior (caregiving and feed-ing practices) of caregivers in theprogram. Program coverage isalmost universal (92 percent) in thecommunities surveyed by the eval-uation. Compared with controlcommunities, program caregiverswere signi cantly more likely to have received counseling onbreastfeeding, care of sick children,hygiene, and iron and vitamin Asupplementation. Immunizationcoverage, iron supplementation,use of oral rehydration therapy ,and vitamin A intake were alsomuch better in program communi-ties. The program has alsocontributed to more rational use ofhealth facilities: nurses say thatthey no longer see patients whomthey do not need to see, allowingthem to focus more attention onpeople with severe disease. Evaluations of the four countries show signi cant improvement in health outcomes. In Brazil the pro-portion of infant mortality causedby diarrhea decreased from 41 per-cent in 1980 to 25 percent in 1989.In Egypt infant mortality caused bydiarrhea fell by an annual averageof 15.9 percent between 1984 and1990, a more rapid decline than formortality attributed to other causes.In Mexico the proportion of under-ve deaths caused by diarrhea declined from 26.4 percent in 1983to 11.0 percent in 1993. In thePhilippines both infant and under-ve mortality rates associated with diarrhea fell by about 5 percentannually between 1975 and 1993.Although other factors may explainthese improved health outcomes, itseems that the National Control ofDiarrheal Diseases Program had animportant impact. A simulationmodel performed in Brazil indicatedthat factors other than oralrehydration therapy explained onlyabout a third of the actual decline.In Guatemala the prevalence of diarrheaamong children under ve fell about 4.5 percent,affecting almost 1.6 millionchildren under ve.A case study found that malnutri- tion had been reduced by 10 per-cent in most communities by1999.Households\u2014Key but Underrated Actors in the Health Sector | 89Item China, Yunnan Province Honduras Sri Lanka Background Although China has recorded impressive In 1990 the maternal mortality ratio In 1950, two years after independence, t he to policy shift reductions in the maternal mortality ratio was 182 per 100,000 live births. maternal mortality ratio was as high as 555 since 1950 (when it was as high as 1,500 per 100,000 live births.per 100,000 live births), the ratio was still about 100 -200 in rural areas in China in 1980. In 1989 it was 149 in Yunnan Province. Policy shift While policies are formulated at the The report of the high maternal national level, strategies to translate policies mortality ratio in 1990 alarmed the into action are determined at the provincial government and triggered a massive level or below. Since 1980 Yunnan Province effort to reduce maternal mortality. The has implemented several policy actions, government focused its efforts strate-such as decentralization to increase local gically on areas with high maternal ownership and accountability and skills mortality ratios.enhancement to reduce maternal deaths. Programmatic In the 1970s \"barefoot doctors \" staffed action village clinics in the province. Since 1982 government regulations have required that doctors take an exam on applied aspects of maternal health (attending clean delivery and identifying risk factors and complica-tions before and during delivery). If they pass, they become \"village doctors \" and receive on-site training. Career growth of village barefoot doctors is thus linked to demonstrated ability to provide maternal health care. Yunnan Province launched the Systematic Management of Pregnant Women (SMPW) in 1985. The program provides every woman with a management booklet, at least ve antenatal care checkups, a minimum of three postnatal visits in her home, and modern delivery methods. The Emergency Referring System for Pregnant Women was formed in Tonghai County in Yunnan Province in 1990. It aims to ensure that women with complications are moved from the village clinic to the county maternal and child health station or hospital. The Emergency Referring System consists of eight strategies: coordination, ensuring functioning phones at all levels, equipping emergency facilities (including vehicles), improving skills, enhancing the referral network, supervising and evaluat-ing, and focusing on meeting targets. Provider accountability is built into the schemes; facility grants, continuation of employment, and promotion of managers are determined on the basis of achievement of set targets.Table 5.2 Reducing barriers to the use of effective maternal health interventions by households Reducing maternal deaths was one of thegoals of the Ministry of Health of the newgovernment that took of ce after indepen- dence. Several decisions reveal the impor-tance it placed on maternal health. In the1950s the government increased accessand coverage to basic maternal and childhealth services by expanding the healthunit system. The system emphasized pre-ventive and health promotion services atthe community level, delivered by skilledattendants and eld workers with guaran- teed professionalism. The managementand infrastructure of maternal health pro-grams was improved with an effectivemonitoring and supervisory system.Transportation and communications wereimproved to provide safe transportationand referral of women with complications. To lower the maternal mortality ratio, the government implemented a two-pronged approach: ensuring thatwomen who develop obstetric emer-gencies are referred to the hospital andidentifying women at high risk for com-plications and encouraging them todeliver in a health facility. To supportthis approach, the government builtseven new rural area hospitals and,with community input, new maternitywaiting homes and birthing centers.The maternity waiting homes are fullymanaged by the local communities. Thenumber of health staff, especially auxil-iary nurses, was increased. Skills of clini-cal staff and community healthworkers, including traditional birthattendants, were enhanced throughtraining, which focused on recognizingrisks in pregnancy and danger signs inchildbirth and make appropriate refer-rals. The Ministry of Health alsoproduced new technical manuals in thisarea.Efforts to reduce maternal mortality took place in three phases. The rst phase focused on making services accessible tothe majority of the population and improv-ing antenatal coverage, midwifery services,and detection and early referral of compli-cations. A public health midwife is respon-sible for all pregnant women in herjurisdiction, covering a population of4,000 -5,000. The second phase involved monitoring the eld maternal and child health program through improved report-ing systems. The third phase emphasizedquality-of-care considerations, particularlyby using the ndings of maternal death inquiries to identify de ciencies in the sys- tem and address those de ciencies through new initiatives. Provider accountability andskill enhancement are critical componentsin the efforts to improve maternal health inSri Lanka.90|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthItem China, Yunnan Province Honduras Sri Lanka Affordability A maternal and child health prepayment Sri Lanka has a very high level of govern- scheme was piloted and is now available ment commitment to, and popular support throughout the province.

The government also provided health education to pregnant women. Accessibility To improve accessibility, the SMPW provides every woman with access to antenatal care and at least three postnatal visits in her home. Access to facilities offering emer-gency services was improved by providing vehicles. User-friendliness Water and Following the acceptance by estate man- sanitation and agement of the initiative to reach estate other cross- workers with health interventions, the two sector linkages government estate agencies implemented a series of interventions to improve waterand sanitation on the estates. In Sri Lankaas a whole, efforts were made to improve sanitation.

Following nationalization of theestates in 1972, medical of cers with trans- portation facilities were appointed to estab-lish a network of estate health clinics. Theclinics provided maternal and child healthand family planning services to the estatepopulation. Through this program, knowl-edge and skills of the estate health staffwere improved. This is a good example of astrategy for improving access tounderserved and neglected populationgroups. Accessibility was explicitly addressed by building maternity waiting homes, withcommunity assistance, alongside sev-eral hospitals. It had been recognizedthat it was sometimes dif cult for women living in remote rural areas toget to a hospital when labor began.The waiting homes provided a way toensure that women were already nearthe hospital when labor began.Construction of new birthing homesbrought skilled attendance at birthcloser to women in hard-to-reach areas.Accessibility was addressed by expanding the health service infrastructure to cover thewhole country and by rapidly educating andtraining health staff. Transportation wassupported through a system of ambulanceservices. Most facilities had ambulances by1950. In addition, the governmentreimburses health staff for the cost of alter-native modes of transportation, enablingthem to better reach the population. Attended deliveries by personnel in govern- ment facilities increased from 33 percent in1950 to 87 percent in 1995, while deliver-ies in the home decreased from 25 percentto 2 percent. Today 95 percent of births areattended by a skilled practitioner, with themajority taking place in hospitals. For estatewomen, deliveries in government facilitiesincreased from 20 percent in 1986 to 63percent in 1997, deliveries in estate mater-nity units rose from 29 percent to 42 per-cent, and deliveries in the home decreasedfrom 37 percent to 8 percent.Households\u2014Key but Underrated Actors in the Health Sector | 91Item China, Yunnan Province Honduras Sri Lanka Impact of In Tonghai county in Yunnan, an already Skilled attendance increased from 46 The maternal mortality ratio in Sri Lank a policies on high rate of hospital delivery in 1990 (70 percent in 1987 -91 to 54 percent by declined from 555 in 1950 to 24 in 1995. health percent) was increased to 92 percent.

Home-based treatment of malaria in Home-based care of people with Strengthening national tuberculosis Item Tigray region of Ethiopia HIV/AIDS in northern Thailand control interventions in China Background to Malaria is a leading killer of children under policy shift ve in Africa. Almost a million children die in Africa from malaria every year. Eighty percent of childhood malaria cases are treated outside of the public sector. Most treatment is provided at home, with drugs purchased from informal drug sellers or pharmacists. The drugs purchased through drug sellers are often of poor quality or counterfeit. Dosages purchased are fre-quently inadequate to fully treat infection. Policy shift It was recognized in the Tigray region of Ethiopia that an effective strategy for ensuring that children receive rapid and effective treatment for malaria would have to focus on improving treatment practices in the household. This would include improving mothers ' ability to detect fever and malaria symptoms and to correctly treat their children with antimalarial drugs. Programmatic Selected \"mother coordinators \" from the action community were trained to provide educa- tion to other mothers in their community on the symptoms and sign of fever and malaria. Mother coordinators were also supplied with chloroquine, which they provided to mothers with sick children along with information on how to administer the drug.Table 5.2 Reducing barriers to the use of effective maternal health interventions by households (continued) Table 5.3 Reducing barriers to the use of effective interventions for malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis by households Two-thirds of the approximately 1 mil- lion people living with HIV/AIDS residein the northern part of Thailand.Historically, rates of infection have beenhigh among women who are or weresex workers, but in the late 1990s thehighest rates of increase were amongwomen in stable relationships. At thattime, HIV prevalence among womenattending antenatal clinics was 4 -8 per- cent. The Sanpatong area was one ofthe hardest hit by the epidemic.Government hospitals were hard-pressed to provide care, with as manyas 60 percent of hospital beds occupiedby people with HIV/AIDS. Unlike in most developing countries, tuberculosis treatment in China was notexempt from the shift to fee-for-servicecare. Case detection and cure rates werelow, and drug-resistant disease wasemerging. Volunteers from the faculty of medicine at Chiang Mai University, Chiang Maipublic health staff, and nurses from theSanpatong Red Cross health center, allwith extensive community experience,decided to pool their practical and aca-demic experience to develop a newcommunity-based holistic model of careto provide \"bio-psycho-social support \" to help people living with HIV/AIDS betreated at home. The bio componentinvolved treatment of symptoms, thepsycho component helped people dealwith stress and problems, and the socialcomponent helped improve the abilityto cope with, participate in, and beaccepted by the community.The World Bank -nanced DOTS program has provided free tuberculosis treatmentfor infectious tuberculosis patients in partsof 16 provinces since 1992. Village doctorsand tuberculosis dispensaries provide DOTScare; hospitals are supposed to referpatients. Providers receive payment fromthe Ministry of Health for each infectiouscase detected and each case cured. The project provided education and skills training to family members, volun-teers from the community, and villageleaders. It recruited volunteer medicalpersonnel and people living withHIV/AIDS through the community.The National TB Control Program within the new Center for Disease Control wasstrengthened to support capacity-building,monitoring, and supervision of providers inthe provinces and counties participating inthe DOTS program.

Itwas staffed by two nurses, one midwife, one immunization ofcer,and one sanitation overseer. Unexpected problems confronted meon arrival. The 52-year-old senior nurse tried to persuade theother staff that I was unable to run the health center and that Iwould rigidly control their day-to-day activities. He might havebeen correct. I was not at all condent about my managementability. Later, I learned he was worried my presence might disturbhis private practice, which he had developed since the last doctorleft six years before.Nobody knew about the budget except him. The health center's workload and achievements were baf- fling.There were only three to ve patients a day.The latestdata, aside from the registers, were from two years before.Guidelines could not be found.They were taken by the lastdoctor when he left. Four months later we received photocopiesof the guidelines from the District Health Ofce.They werenot too helpful for managerial matters.There was no money leftfor operational tasks even though the year had three months togo.The doctor's house was dirty and unfurnished.The previousdoctor took the furniture when he left. A request for replace-ment was sent to the District Health Ofce, but six years hadpassed with no response. Staff suggested I take a spare exami-nation bed from the health center. I did this because I could notafford to buy a bed.The staff lacked initiative. No one came towork before 10 a.m., and everyone left before 1 p.m.They saidthat there was little to do. Source: World Bank staff, Indonesia.Health providers in both the public and private sectors, and in both the formal and informal sectors, play a keyrole in delivering interventions of relevance to theMillennium Development Goals. Many are efcient,deliver high-quality care, and are responsive to theirpatients. But many are not.As a result, resources\u2014publicand private\u2014are wasted, and facilities sit underused.Patients often receive care that is inappropriate to theirneeds, paying for it out of very limited means.They mayalso receive care that is downright dangerous. T wo things can make a difference.One is the quality of management. Better management means a clearer delin-eation of responsibilities and accountabilities inside organi-zations, a clearer link between performance and reward,and so on.The rst part of the chapter reviews these andother elements of good management, providing examplesof where better management has made a difference. Something else can also make a difference. Manage- ment means getting accountabilities right within anorganization. Equally important\u2014if not more so\u2014areaccountabilities between the organization and the public.These can be improved along one or both of two routes. 1 The short route, leading directly from the patient to theprovider, can be strengthened through a variety ofschemes, including vouchers, report cards, and citizenmanagement groups.The long route,leading from the cit-izen to the policymaker and then to the provider, can bestrengthened at two points\u2014the citizen-policymakerrelationship (making policymakers more responsive to cit- izens) and the policymaker-provider relationship (makingproviders more responsive to policymakers). The World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People 1provides a thorough discussion\u2014for several sectors\u2014of ways to strengthen both routes andboth elements of the long route.The focus here is on justone sector (health) and within it on services and serviceproviders of special relevance to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals for health.The focus is also on justtwo relationships\u2014the link between the patient and thefront-line provider and the link between the policymakerand the provider organization. The interested reader isreferred to the World Development Report for ways of strengthening the citizen-policymaker link, a genericrather than health-specic issue. Another area of service delivery is only partially cov- ered in this chapter. This is the delivery mode\u2014wheredifferent services should be delivered and by which med-ical staff (see box 6.1 and chapter 7). 94|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 6.1 The changing mix of cure and care: Who treats what\u2014and where? Throughout the twentieth century, service institutions have responded\u2014albeit slowly\u2014to rapid changes in health technology.Countries choose combinations of \"delivery modes\" based oncosts and international standards but also on country-specic char-acteristics, such as geographic and density constraints, transportand infrastructure capacity, existing health infrastructure inheritedfrom previous technological innovations, labor market characteris-tics, training and orientation of providers, and so on.What is deliv-ered as inpatient treatment, outpatient hospital, health center orhome visits\u2014and by whom\u2014is far from standard across countries. T echnological progress triggers modications in the nature, type, and quantity of services required. Hospital tuberculosis treat-ment (the sanatorium) was replaced by outpatient clinical carethanks to antibiotics. Screening followed by treatment\u2014DOTS(directly observed treatment, short-course)\u2014were later standard-ized to allow delivery through community outreach. Similarly,new treatments for HIV and cancer cut long hospitalizationrequirements. The care and cure functions of the hospital alsoevolve. Hospitals are being transformed into long-term care cen- ters for the elderly, while more complex procedures are conductedin ambulatory clinics. Home-based nursing care is being revived. Countries at similar levels of technology have opted for dif- ferent models with comparable success. Independent practition-ers developed rst in Western countries and have been thecornerstone of Western systems. The hegemony of hospitals inthe Western world is no older than the twentieth century. Incontrast, hospitals have played a much larger role in the provisionof outpatient care in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, LatinAmerica, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. In Africa health systems devel-oped through hospitals and mobile clinics since the beginning ofthe twentieth century, with primary health care emerging onlyin the 1980s. Different skill levels are also used for similar inter-ventions. Health technicians and nurses have performed cae-sarean sections in Mozambique, while other countries usegeneral practitioners or skilled obstetricians. Source: Reference 1.Who's who in the health sector\u2014 and the challenges that face them Anyone attempting to improve service delivery has to wrestle with the fact that a variety of providers deliver careof relevance to the Millennium Development Goals, oftento the same person in the same illness episode.The array ofrelevant providers is bewildering (box 6.2). The boundaries between the different sets of actors\u2014 especially between public and private\u2014can seem confusing,because a provider may be, say, private on one dimensionbut public on another. Payment can be public or private, regardless of who provides the services.Ownership of the business or activity. Ownership refers not to the ownership of the premises but to the ownership ofany leftover funds (or debts) at the end of the year,after allcosts have been paid.When clinics or hospitals are pub-licly owned,leftover funds belong to the treasury or pub-lic purse.When clinics or hospitals are privately owned,the organization itself or a private person has a legal claimto all leftover revenue. For a nonprot entity, the protscannot be distributed outside the organization. Ownership of premises. Public clinics are almost always located in publicly owned buildings. Private clinics, andeven hospitals, however, often do not own theirpremises but rather rent them.Sometimes private clinicsare even run in publicly owned buildings.This does notmake the business, or operation, any less \"private,\" since the leftover revenue still remains with the organizationor its owners. Employment. Health professionals can work in the public sector, the private sector, or both. Sometimesthis is legal. Sometimes it is not. Sometimes peopleemployed in the public sector \"steal\" the time they aresupposed to devote to public employment and sell itprivately, in much the same way that they sometimessteal drugs and sell them privately. It is not difcult todistinguish what is public and private in this case.When employees work for a public organization andsteal time, they are stealing from a public employer.When employees sell what they have stolen\u2014be itdrugs or time\u2014it is a private transaction (they are sell-ing something they own, even if they obtained it bystealing). By being clear about which aspect of health services deliv- ery is being discussed, it is easy to distinguish whether it ispublic or private. Such distinctions are critical in under-standing the organization of health services and the incen-tives associated with the organization. The public sector Many of the problems associated with the public sector arerooted in the more general structural problems related tothe broader public sector: service commitments greatly in excess of allocated funds,undermining the accountability relations betweenpolicymakers and service providers weak public sector accountability arrangements and lim- ited capacity for core administrative and policymakingtasks managers who are judged not on performance but on \"political merit\" managers who are appointed not on their technical merits but through cronyism budgets that are unpredictable and funds that leak out of the public sector Improving Service Delivery | 95Box 6.2 Who delivers which care for the Millennium Development Goals for health? The answer to the question \"Who delivers which care for the health Millennium Development Goals?\" is simple\u2014a bewilder-ing variety. Public providers include primary health clinics, health cen- ters, and hospitals. Public providers of potential relevance forachieving the Millennium Development Goals include rural andurban clinics and health posts, as well as rst-level referral hospi-tals. Public facilities are almost always arranged as a hierarchy offacilities\u2014of decreasing sophistication as one gets farther intorural areas. Facilities are formally staffed by qualied medicalstaff, who are salaried civil service employees (and managedlargely from outside the facility). Services are often ofcially free or subsidized. Public funds flow to facilities based on installed capacity and centrally estab-lished norms.Accountability for performance is through admin-istrative oversight, usually by the Ministry of Health, less often bylocal government bodies. Oversight typically focuses on appro-priate use of funds and adherence to rules related to personnel.The largest facilities\u2014referral hospitals\u2014are often integratedinto the political realm, in that senior management is appointedand dismissed following changes in government. Private providers come in three broad guises: For-prot formal providers include registered self- employed doctors, clinics, hospitals, and diagnostic clinics, aswell as registered, organized, formally trained traditionalhealers (ayurvedic healers, traditional Chinese medicine healers, midwives). Nonprot formal providers or nongovernmental organiza- tions often operate primary health care facilities as well asdistrict\u2014and sometimes referral\u2014hospitals. They ofteninclude organizations undertaking outreach activities, suchas information, education, and communication programsand social marketing. For-prot informal providers include traditional healers, drug sellers, pharmacists (who offer informal diagnosis andrecommendations on medications to take), unqualiedpractitioners of allopathic medicine, and traditional birthattendants. All play a role in delivering services and interventions relevant to the Millennium Development Goals. And there is a strikingdegree of heterogeneity within a country for the same type ofintervention or service. One woman might have her baby deliv-ered by a traditional birth attendant. Another might have hersdelivered by a midwife at home. A third might have hers deliv-ered by a doctor at a hospital. One child with diarrhea might betaken to a public facility, while another might be taken to a pri-vate provider. T o complicate matters further, the same personmay visit several types of provider within the same illnessepisode\u2014some in the public sector, some in the private. Source: World Bank staff. self-selection into the public sector of staff who prefer a work environment not based on performance an inappropriate wage structure While important,these problems are generally best addressed through interventions that cover the entire public sector. Other problems can be addressed within the health ministry or sector.These include: low wages leakages of funds from the ministry of health to facilities weak external accountability arrangements for service delivery tasks a lack of management skills and training on the part of health facility management; managers who do notmanage staff (civil service) and who cannot thereforebe held accountable or make required cost savings orquality-enhancing changes signicantly higher costs to deliver services in rural areas (people educated in cities prefer not to live in rural areas) unclear objectives and responsibilities of provider organizations the fact that the services produced are valued by indi- viduals and can be sold privately, which, coupled withweak management, leads to dual practice and absen-teeism the perception that the work (such as treating people with HIV/AIDS) is dangerous general skills that are valued elsewhere, leading to emi- gration and loss of staff to the private sector The private sector Various structural features create service delivery problemsfor the nonprot sector as well. Its dependence on dona-tions and other inputs tied to philanthropy or altruismlimits its opportunity to expand. Many nonprots operat-ing in developing countries rely extensively on interna-tional nonprots for funding, making their fundingunpredictable. Some nonprots undertake religious orpolitical activities or are closely associated with organiza-tions that do.This sometimes contributes to a lack of trustby governments and the population, hampering theiractivities and growth prospects. 2The absence or weakness of mechanisms or forums for regular communication andcoordination with other nonprots and with policymakersreduces the efciency of nonprots. The formal for-prot sector also exhibits certain struc- tural features that can cause problems. The bottom-linefocus discourages the sector from cross-subsidizing patientsor services, and the desire for return customers can leadfor-prot providers to deliver unneeded or inappropriatecare when patients want it. In developing countries, mutualdistrust, and often animosity, between the government andthe private health care sector is common, meaning thatinteraction with the public system is minimal. Even wherecommon interests exist, the lack of mechanisms or forumsfor interaction and coordination makes working togethervery difcult. The informal private sector can also be weakened by various underlying structural issues. In developing coun-tries,regulation usually has very little influence on informalprivate providers.They tend to be weakly organized, mak-ing it hard for policymakers to reach them with any policyintervention, and there is little or no professional supportfor quality improvement. Informal providers are almostalways organized as solo practices, a setting known toundermine the quality of care.They are also isolated fromthe public sector and the formal private sector,further con-straining coordination and the quality of care. Animosityfrom the formal allopathic medical profession keeps themisolated and excluded from most policy dialogue. Better management\u2014improving accountability within provider organizations The Malaysian state of Sarawak and the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan face one another across the Malaysia-Indonesia border.They share language,ethnicity,and religiouscharacteristics (box 6.3).Y et the approach to management intheir public health facilities is markedly different. Sarawakhealth workers are highly committed to quality and client sat-isfaction. They work in teams in a cooperative fashion, andthey are encouraged to set priorities in the light of local cir-cumstances, to take initiative, and to be innovative.Their atti-tude reflects a deliberate policy in Malaysia to encourage localinitiative, right down to the individual staff member.The aimis to instill, through training and the use of health systemsresearch as a management tool, strong problem-solving anddecisionmaking skills in management teams\u2014at the facility,district,and provincial levels.Initiative is rewarded:each year ahealth worker is chosen to receive a prestigious nationalaward recognizing personal initiative. Across the border in West Kalimantan, things work dif- ferently. The Indonesian government imposes detailedguidelines, activity schedules, and workload norms on staff,leaving no room for local decisionmaking and initiative. These two sets of facilities provide examples of two entirely different perspectives on management. TheIndonesian approach has its roots in the hierarchicalcommand-and-control model.Initiative and decisionmakingare exercised only at the highest level. Problems encountered 96|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthImproving Service Delivery | 97at lower levels are passed up to higher levels for a decision. There are no managers in the true sense of the word.Instead, administrators execute decisions according to previ-ously agreed protocols and rules, with little or no scope forautonomous decisionmaking at the facility level.The Malaysian approach, by contrast, has more in com- mon with the new public sector management philosophy. 3,4 Responsibility for tasks and decisionmaking is delegated tospecic parts of the organization and to specic individuals.Individual accountability is emphasized, and there is a focusBox 6.3 Different management styles, different countries\u2014but just miles apart In March 1999 a team that included Indonesian and Malaysian experts and an expatriate medical anthropologist spent a monthvisiting health facilities and assessing service delivery in Sarawak(Malaysia) and the adjacent Kalbar Province of West Kalimantan(Indonesia), areas that share some language, ethnicity, and reli-gious characteristics. Both Indonesia and Malaysia are commit-ted to the Health for All vision. But discussions with staff,patients, community leaders, and others revealed important dif-ferences in approach\u2014differences that probably account formuch of the strikingly different results observed in these adjacentprovinces. For example, the estimated infant mortality rate inSarawak, 9 deaths per 1,000 live births, is roughly a fth of therate thought to prevail in Kalbar. Facilities In Sarawak clinics are spacious and clean, and they provide a healthy environment in a well-maintained setting.Local attendantsare hired to maintain each facility. Every clinic has a deliveryroom. Clean water is available, and the latrines and furniture aresuperior to those in Indonesia. In Kalbar the team encounteredlthy unused rooms with equipment in disrepair and patients whoneeded to be referred to other facilities.But it also found a pristineclinic with a healing herb garden,patients happy with services,andstaff whose only complaint was that they weren't paid enough. Uniformity or innovation Conditions and services of the same level in Sarawak are stan- dardized and predictable regardless of where facilities are located.Only three staff are posted in each rural clinic, with consistencyof effort and skill maintained.The health care provided may notstray from that guaranteed by the system.The medical assistant ispermitted to follow up a complex case only after the doctorreceiving the referral has established the treatment regimen. Butthe state health department encourages personnel to be innova-tive. A prestigious award goes every year to staff who developnew ways to accomplish their tasks. Program activities Sarawak's clinics, unlike Kalbar's, provide only outpatient and mother and child health services. Health education is integratedinto every activity. Outreach activities are done by village healthteams and the Flying Doctor Service, each based in the divisionalhealth ofce.The only outreach handled by clinics is the updatingof the village health survey every two years.This census identiesvillages with low health status, a key step in Sarawak's initiative to decentralize priority-setting to clinics. Quality issues Quality-related slogans and pictures appear on ofce walls in facilities throughout Sarawak.Almost everyone,from the directorin Kuching (the state capital) to medical assistants at Klinik Desa,talks about quality. Quality is their culture, influencing the waythey think and deliver services. Starting with top managers,everyone in the system is trained in quality.This contrasts starklywith the situation in Indonesia, where efforts to improve qualitystarted at the grass roots without preparing managers. TheSarawak Health Department's vision, mission, and client charterare displayed to staff and the public. Every service and supportunit must develop and exhibit its client charter. Competence of staff Medical assistants, who perform the same tasks as nurses in Indonesia's Puskesmas, were trained to diagnose and treat certain diseases. Their training\u2014senior high school plus three years ofnursing school\u2014is equivalent to Akademi Perawat in Indonesia. New staff also receive training on quality assurance and corporateculture before they are deployed. Staff receive briefs about eldactivities and the obstacles they may encounter. Motivational andcorporate culture courses are held annually.The Sarawak HealthDepartment also provides staff with technical guidelines.All staffconcerned use the guidelines, unlike Kalbar, where most staff saidthey had never read or referred to the guidelines. Sarawak's tech-nical and administrative guidelines are readable, clear, well-structured, and comprehensive. And implementation of theguidelines is closely monitored through quarterly quality checks.Staff performance, linked to salary increments, is assessed yearly. Teamwork and management T eamwork is demonstrated at all levels in Sarawak. T wo key ele- ments are dedication to quality and customer value and an environ-ment of cooperation with rewards for the success of teams ratherthan individuals. An informal and professional atmosphere exists,with staff throughout the state having met each other or evenworked together. In Kalbar interpersonal and interorganizationalcommunication is poor, community acceptance of services is lim-ited,and effort and imagination in training personnel is minimal. Source: Reference 6.on performance\u2014not inputs and processes but outputs and outcomes.5Good performance is rewarded, nancially or in some other way.There is a focus on clients and a belief thatan organization is ultimately accountable to its clients. Aclient-oriented strategy emphasizes customer choice and sat-isfaction. Business techniques enhance performance and area standard part of strategic planning. Elements of the philosophy are evident in successful nutrition and child health programs. In Tamil Nadu'sIntegrated Nutrition Program (box 6.4), communitynutrition workers were given clearly dened duties.Information on outputs enabled the community to keepworkers accountable, and it enabled the workers to seehow their programs were working. In C\u00e9ara's Programa deAgentes de Sa\u00fade (box 6.5), credited with a substantialreduction in child mortality, health agents and nurse-supervisors were assigned clear tasks and given clearresponsibilities, and the intended outcomes of the programwere emphasized throughout to both health workers andmembers of the public. Good performance by a team(high immunization rates) was rewarded with a prize.Andhealth agents were held accountable for their performancethrough a community-based monitoring process. World Health Organization guidelines in developing national Integrated Management of Childhood Illness(IMCI) programs stress clear denitions of the roles ofcentral and district levels, strengthening existing manage-ment structures, involving staff with good clinical skills insupervision, and using management information to solveproblems and improve planning. 7Performance feedback, which is also emphasized, has been found in Niger to havea \"signicant and consistent\" impact on provider perfor-mance among those with previously low compliance. 8 In maternal health, too, successful programs include ele- ments of the new public sector management philosophy.China has a multilevel management strategy to achievematernal health goals. Management plans for maternal andreproductive health care are developed at the lower levels,and those managers are rated on specic tasks, which alsoserve as a basis for promotion. Greater autonomy andaccountability through this system have helped promotepreventive measures and increase referral rates amonghigh-risk pregnant women. 9 In other settings, audits and evidence-based standards have improved the quality of obstetric care. In Indonesia the gov-ernment committed itself to systematized, district-level auditsto monitor performance and ensure quality of care. Malaysiaintensies management attention to underperforming dis-tricts identied through such procedures, revising protocolsfor personnel and facilities on the basis of data it collects. 10,11 Performance-oriented measures have been shown to be effective. In Ecuador quality assurance measures signi-cantly increased provider compliance with clinical stan-dards for maternal health, even without additionalresources to implement the initiative. 12In Ghana and Jamaica the introduction of audits as a monitoring andnonpunitive educational tool was associated with betterprocesses for obstetric care (more use of protocols), withfeedback identied as crucial to successes. 13In South Africa an adolescent services program links achievementof national standards and criteria to accreditation of publicsector \"adolescent-friendly\" clinics. Using a combinationof quality improvement methods, external assessment, anda rating system, the program has been integrated into abroader sexual health program, with promising results. 14,15 Institutional reform\u2014strengthening the accountability of provider organizations Public providers Attempts to improve the performance of public providers\u2014 most often focusing on productivity and quality\u2014are themost common service delivery reforms in developingcountries.The mechanisms applied in the health sector typ-ically seek to alter institutional arrangements to create betterincentives for public providers\u2014either by increasing theleverage of patients (the short route of accountability) or byimproving the effectiveness of supervision (part of the longroute). Mechanisms to increase patient leverage and super-visory effectiveness often rely on nancial incentives byseeking to tie payments to provider organizations (not nec-essarily individual providers) more closely to performance.Some initiatives also seek to reduce organizational con-straints associated with public sector ownership that blockresponses to existing incentives. Some are in the realm ofpublic sector reform more broadly (civil service reform,budget management and execution reform, improvedhuman resource policies) and are not reviewed here. PERFORMANCE -BASED PAYMENT (INTERNAL CONTRACTS ) Public sector organizations in develop- ing countries are typically neither recognized norrewarded for better performance. So performance-basedpayment is a common strategy to improve performance. Itconsists of formal agreements between a governmentsupervisory agency and public providers linking remuner-ation to specic aspects of performance. This fundingarrangement for public services, widespread in industrialcountries, is now more common in middle-income coun-tries. The agreements typically focus on increasing pro-ductivity (and sometimes quality) by clarifying relatedorganizational objectives and responsibilities, therebystrengthening policymakers' accountability relationshipwith the provider(s). When applied to primary care, the 98|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthpayment often flows to providers based on patient choice. In these cases, the strategy also relies on increasing theleverage of patients to improve accountability.Another keyelement of the improved incentives is the enhancedenforceability of the agreement\u2014that is, the ability to ver-ify when responsibilities have been fullled or not on bothsides and the fact that at least part of the funding flows aretied to some measurable aspect of performance. Does it work? Evidence on impact in developing countries is mixed. Performance-based payment appears towork fairly well in middle-income countries and less well Improving Service Delivery | 99Box 6.4 Management in India's Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Program The Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Program,started in 1980,was converted to the Integrated Child Development Services Programin 1997. Core features of the program were growth monitoring,nutrition education, and food supplementation programs, imple-mented in community nutrition centers by community nutritionworkers.The program was successful in several respects. It reducedsevere malnutrition in the program areas. It has been sustained for along period.And it operates on a large scale. Reductions in moder-ate malnutrition were lower than expected,but the results have beenattributed to unrealistic targets rather than the level of achievement. How did the management of human resources contribute to the positive results of the program? Changes in stafng and jobdesign,training and supervision,and monitoring made a difference. Stafng and job design The program implemented well-designed procedures for stafng and job design: Recruitment. Individuals were eligible to become commu- nity nutrition workers if they resided in the village, had atleast eight years of schooling, and were acceptable to thecommunity. Special efforts were made to recruit womenwho were both poor and had healthy and well-nourishedchildren. The rationale for this approach was that therewould be no social barrier between the community nutri-tion workers and their poor clients and that they would becredible, since they had already managed to raise well-nourished children despite their low socioeconomic status. Duties and work routines. T o help community nutrition work- ers focus on priority issues, their job description included alimited number of clearly dened duties, to be performedaccording to a specic work schedule.Village registration ofwomen and children was to be conducted once every threemonths. Growth monitoring took place during three days amonth. The supplementary feeding program was imple-mented between set hours in the morning. Home visitswere conducted in the afternoon. Rewards. The community nutrition workers received a low monthly wage, but their compensation was still higher thanthey would have earned as agricultural workers. Communitynutrition workers were also motivated by factors other thanincome: the satisfaction of helping others and the higher sta-tus that came from being associated with a program thatimproved the lives of their peers in the community.Training and supervision The community nutrition workers received training and super- vision support in two main areas: Preservice training. Community nutrition workers and com- munity nutrition supervisors received training that lastedtwo months, a signicant amount of time for this kind ofprogram.Training groups were kept small, enabling a strongemphasis on role-playing exercises. Supervision and in-service training. The high supervisor-to- worker ratio (one community nutrition supervisor super-vised 10-15 community nutrition workers) meant thatcommunity nutrition supervisors had time to adequatelysupervise the community nutrition workers. In addition toroutine supervision, joint home visits were made to familieswho failed to bring their children to weighing and feedingor whose children did not gain weight after 90 days of foodsupplementation. The community nutrition supervisorswere in turn supervised by community nutrition instructors. Monitoring The monitoring system generated timely and good-quality data, although too much information was sometimes collected.Monitoring information was used for two purposes: Information for workers and clients. Special efforts were made to collect data not only for managers but for frontlineworkers and their clients in the communities as well. Everymonth data collected by the community nutrition workerswere displayed outside the community nutrition centers.The data included information on the number of childrenwho had been weighed, the number of children of differentnutritional status, and the number of children who receivedsupplementary feeding. These data provided communitymembers with an idea of how the program was doing. Information for management. Community nutrition supervi- sors and instructors collated information from the commu-nity nutrition workers during monthly meetings.The datawere sent to the project coordination ofce, to be con-verted into key performance indicators and used for overallmanagement of the program.

Performance-based payment appears easier to apply for primary care services than for acute care, probably becauseit is more feasible to tie the payment allocation to patientchoice of provider. (It is widely accepted that patients canjudge the quality of primary care services, and henceproviders, better than they can judge hospitals and hospitalservice quality.) There is more evidence from middle-income countries, especially from Latin America and Central and EasternEurope. In both regions there is stronger evidence of posi-tive impact for performance-based payments at the pri-mary care level than at higher levels of care. Such evidencecomes from Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Peru,Poland, and Romania. 18,23,25,26In Argentina and Nicaragua social security institutes have increased productivity byestablishing capitation payments for an integrated packageof inpatient and ambulatory services.27In Central Europe, where capped, case-based payments cover inpatient ser-vices, increases in the volume of services and decliningaverage lengths of stay\u2014in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, andthe Russian Federation\u2014suggest increases in productiv-ity. 18* Deterioration in quality (due to skimping on costly nonobservable aspects of quality) has not arisen as a seriousconcern. Elsewhere in the former Soviet republics, and inLatin America, the results are more ambiguous.This lack ofresponse is typically attributed to insufcient providerautonomy and a weak link between performance and pay(insufcient funds relative to service commitments). When does it work best? Key influences on the success of the approach include whether the publicprovider has the ability to respond (see the discussion of 100|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 6.5 Innovative and effective management of public health workers in C\u00e9ara, Brazil Although it is one of the poorest states in Brazil, the northeastern state of C\u00e9ara has achieved impressive improvements in child health.The infant mortality rate fell from about 100 per 1,000 live births inthe mid-1980s to 65 in 1992,a 36 percent reduction.A rural preven-tive health program, Programa de Agentes de Sa\u00fade (health agentprogram,PAS),has been credited with much of the improvement. A central feature of the program was the use of health agents, who visited households to provide advice and assistance on oralrehydration therapy, vaccination, antenatal care, breastfeeding,and growth monitoring.The agents also collected data for healthmonitoring purposes. By 1993 the health agents were makingmonthly home visits to 850,000 families\u2014roughly 65 percent ofthe state's population. Even though health agents did not earnmore than the minimum wage and worked under temporarycontracts without job security or fringe benets, they performedwell and helped achieve important health gains. How did C\u00e9ara achieve this? Effective public management of human resources played a large role, in a variety of areas, includ-ing addressing concerns about clientelism, the hiring process,motivation, supervision, and community monitoring. Addressing concerns about clientelism Before PAS was initiated in 1987, most municipalities had no public health program.At most, the mayor had an ambulance athis disposal and kept a small stock of prescription medicines athis home. Medicines and ambulance rides were usually given torelatives and friends in return for political loyalty. The new Brazilian constitution of 1988 increased mayors' access to rev-enues for health expenditures, as it increased federal transfers tothe municipalities.The planners of the PAS had to work withinthis context of decentralization. They feared that hiring a largenumber of health agents and nurse-supervisors would be vulner-able to clientelism.The state addressed the problem in three mainways. First, it hired workers based on merit and offered themtemporary contracts, not job tenure. Second, the health agents'salaries were paid directly from the governor's ofce.Third, thestate health department appropriated the responsibility for hiringthe health agents, while leaving the hiring of nurses to supervisethe health agents to each municipality. Hiring The state-level coordinating committee placed strong emphasis on hiring people based on merit. It required all applicants to sub-mit written applications, from which it selected candidates tointerview. T wo members of the selection team (usually a nurseand a social worker) then traveled to each town for interviews,followed by a group meeting.The group meeting was often fol-lowed by a second round of individual interviews with candidateslikely to be selected.The visits of the hiring team created a senseof excitement in the towns and added to the prestige of beingselected. Although the jobs paid only the minimum wages andcame with no fringe benets, many people found the position * Since other systemic changes have been implemented along with performance-based payment in Central Europe,it is not possible to attributethe results to any single aspect of the reforms (such as the payment mechanism).autonomization below), whether service commitments are congruent with funding levels, whether output and keycomponents of performance expectations are easily mea-surable (as in primary healthcare), and how far capacitystrengthening of the payer or funder is addressed as a cen-tral part of the initiative. Other factors are important, too. Positive impacts are more likely when the potential bonuses to be gained bybetter performance are sufcient to justify substantialeffort by the provider.And responses are greater when theprovider organization can retain and allocate the extra rev-enues. Schemes in which this is not the case have little orno impact. Can the patient choose the provider and in theprocess direct funding flows? For hospitals it appears thatthe threat to take away funding is usually perceived as hol- low. So reforms are more successful when performancepressure relies not on pressure from competition for mar-ket share but on the possibility of bonuses.AUTONOMIZATION The weak impact of performance- based payment strategies in public hospitals is frequentlyattributed to the lack of decisionmaking authority and flex-ibility to respond to incentives.That is why another strat-egy\u2014autonomization\u2014is used, often in conjunction withor following those just described. Autonomization consistsof delegating additional decisionmaking authority to hospi-tals. It aims to improve productivity by giving providers theflexibility to respond to performance incentives, especiallyto manage labor and production, to pay staff based on per-formance, and to undertake cost-saving or quality-enhanc-ing changes. 28Autonomization also often seeks to create some risk-bearing for the provider to motivate performance(residual claimant status). In low-income countries autono-mization is most often driven by scal crises and a desire toshift more care toward the primary level.There is usually afocus on mobilizing resources in the autonomized facilitiesfrom user fees. Autonomization does not work throughimproving the accountability relations for policymakers orpatients\u2014it seeks to increase the ability of providers torespond to whatever incentives\u2014created primarily by the Improving Service Delivery | 101desirable, particularly as it was a year-round rather than a seasonal job.The newly hired workers began their jobs with a strong senseof prestige for having been selected. Motivation The positive effects of the hiring process were enhanced during the implementation period.The program received much publi-city, in large part thanks to funding from private rms for radioand television campaigns. Municipalities that achieved the high-est immunization coverage were awarded prizes, further addingto the prestige of agents in the communities.The program pro-vided three months of full-time training to the health agents, astrong motivating factor. Access to this kind of training wasunimaginable to most people in the interior of C\u00e9ara. Healthagents were also motivated by the fact that their jobs were morediverse and satisfying than most other jobs in the area. Supervision Supervision of the health agents by nurses was a critical part to the program's success. In urban clinics and hospitals, where manyof the nurse-supervisors had previously worked, they had a sub-ordinate status and performed much more administrative workrather than actual nursing duties.They often felt alienated fromtheir work and ignored as professionals. In the program in C\u00e9ara,their status changed dramatically. Each nurse supervised andtrained 30 health agents and was considered a very importantperson in the community.The nurses were also paid more thanthey had been paid in their previous jobs.These factors helped the state ensure good supervision of its health agents. Community monitoring In addition to effective supervision by nurses, the community made sure that health agents performed well. During the hiringprocess, the program linked prestige not just to those who passedthe rigorous selection process but to the whole program and itsmission of reducing infant mortality and morbidity. A specialmessage was given to applicants who were not chosen for thejob.They were encouraged to make sure that the health agentsfollowed the rules of the program.The rules, constantly repeated,were that the health agents had to live in the area in which theyworked, work eight hours a day, visit each household at leastonce a month, and attend all training and review sessions. T o avoid turning disgruntled job-seekers into overzealous watchdogs, the selection committee conveyed the message to theapplicants in a way that made them feel involved in the program.Indeed, community members reported to the nurse-supervisorswhen they felt satised about the job a particular agent wasdoing, not only when they perceived that the agent had donesomething wrong.This socialization of all job applicants to theprogram's mission created an informal but powerful monitoringpresence in the communities, adding to a sense of collectiveresponsibility for the program.

Public providers rarely perceive the threat of not receiving a contract as credible, even where alternative providers exist.28public payment system and the choices of private payers\u2014 exist. Does it work? No rigorous evaluation of autonomiza- tion has been conducted in low-income settings.The assess-ments that have been done have produced mixed results. 29 Efciency and sometimes quality have improved when labormanagement is delegated\u2014as they did in India andKenya. 30,31But the emphasis on revenue generation from fees has undermined access for the poor in a number of countries,including Indonesia and Malaysia. 32,33Results in middle- income countries are better,with evidence of efciency gainsin Colombia 34and efciency gains combined with quality improvements in Tunisia.32The greater capacity of the funder or payer in middle-income countries allows the use of pay-ments as performance leverage for providers. When does it work best? A variety of factors influ- ence the success of autonomization.Are services for the poorpaid for or otherwise supported and monitored? Are agree-ments about maintenance of important but money-losingservices explicit and monitored? Is there explicit support forcentral government and other administrative ofcials to shiftthe nature of their oversight? The reform time horizon forautonomization is long (three to ve years). Managementcapacity needs to be in place in the provider unit before thereform is imitated\u2014or at least strengthened as a central partof reform.There has to be an explicit and focused effort tocreate accountability mechanisms that are not based on day-to-day administrative control (oversight boards, regulation,accreditation).The organization's mandate has to be narrowand clear. And output-based or performance-based fundinghas to be in place before the provider reforms. PRIVATIZATION Like autonomization for hospitals,pri- vatization has been applied at the primary level to give pub-lic providers the freedom and the high-powered incentivesthat come from being the owner (residual claimant).Privatization at the primary level converts a salaried publiclyemployed physician into a self-employed independent con-tractor, with a service contract with a public payer (such as asocial insurance organization). The strategy was imple-mented to different degrees in almost all Central Europeancountries following the establishment of social insurancesystems (95 percent of primary healthcare providers in theCzech Republic and 80 percent in Estonia have been priva-tized). In Croatia, Estonia, and Romania the capitation pay-ment is allocated based on patients' choice of provider. Does it work? Privatization of primary healthcare, in conjunction with capitation-based payment and training infamily medicine, is associated with positive results in threeassessed cases in Central Europe. In Estonia the annual num-ber of visits per doctor and the number of visits per inhabi-tant rose. Immunization coverage, which is paid for sepa-rately, rose from 74 percent to 88 percent. 20In Romania the use of primary healthcare\u2014a key goal of the initiative\u2014increased signicantly. 23Efciency also increased. And as in Estonia, signicant increases in immunization rates wereobserved. In Croatia efciency was not assessed in the priva-tized practices, but physicians were more accessible andpatient satisfaction had increased. 22 The reform appears to generate two sources of accountability: pressure to please patients enough to main-tain registered patients and requirements for pricing, pro-fessional licensing, facility adequacy, and other stafng tomaintain the contract with the insurer. But privatization inthese three countries, and others in the region, has beenassociated with fragmentation (such as reduced practicesize), raising concerns about reduced efciency and a pos-sible decline in clinical quality. When does it work best? Privatization of health ser- vices in developing countries has been assessed only at theprimary healthcare level.It appears to work well when thereis an established, solvent purchaser in place and capitationpayments are combined with patient choice.The tendencytoward fragmentation may be reduced by contract processesthat promote group practice (price-setting) and by provi-sions to promote access to capital and premises. DECENTRALIZATION Decentralization is intended to improve the quality of services and the productivity ofproviders by strengthening the policymaker's accountabil-ity relations with providers (the local government supervi-sor is closer). Indirectly, decentralization may increasepatient leverage, as patients are likely to be able to exertmore pressure on local governments to improve healthservices than they could on the central government, partlybecause information on preferences and performance iseasier to obtain at the local level. Does it work? The impact of decentralization has been mixed in low-income countries.The health serviceselement of broad decentralization initiatives has been par-ticularly poorly designed and implemented, often drivenby political or scal considerations. In Tanzania decentral-ization improved the efciency of and access to primaryhealthcare services, but in Ghana efciency declined. 35 There have been notable examples of deterioration in theprovision of public goods, such as disease surveillance andpreventative services (Ghana, Indonesia,Tanzania), and inthe equity of access (Uganda). There is less evidence onthe impact of decentralization in middle-income coun-tries, though it has generated improvements in responsive-ness and equity in Colombia. 36 102|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthWhen does it work best? Adequate resources to operate services have to be allocated along with new serviceresponsibilities. Local political institutions have to be rela-tively functional (voters need to have influence\u2014anotherelement of the long route of accountability).Health author-ities have to be integrally involved in designing and imple-menting the decentralization initiatives for health services.Concerted efforts to build local government capacity\u2014planning, supervision, budgeting, and expenditure andnancial management\u2014have to be part of the initiative.Mechanisms also need to be in place to ensure capacity tocover the core public functions outlined in chapter 8 (dis-ease surveillance and control, funding for and attention topreventive services and services that promote health, humanresource planning, interregional coordination). Adequatetime has to be allocated to design and implementation,especially for building the capacity of local authorities toperform new oversight tasks. GOVERNANCE PARTICIPATION Participation is intended to improve productivity and the quality of ser-vices by involving representatives of community interestsin the governance of local facilities. It relies on directlystrengthening the leverage of patients (the short route ofaccountability), or at least their representatives, in provideroversight. Patients' rst-hand knowledge and influenceshorten the \"feedback\" loop of supervisory accountability. Does it work? Some governments have had difculty establishing meaningful participation, but there have beenpositive changes where it has been established. In BurkinoFaso participation of community representatives in publicprimary healthcare clinics increased immunization coverageand the availability of essential drugs. 37The percentage of women with two or more antenatal visits also increased.Butthe resources spent increased as well, so it is not possible toassess the impact on efciency. In Peru participation is asso-ciated with reduced absenteeism of staff, reduced waitingtimes, and the perception of higher quality by patients. 26,38 When does it work best? No formal evaluation of participation has been conducted, but several characteris-tics seem to contribute to success. Better results areachieved where the selection process for representatives istransparent and involves community members rather thanappointed representatives. Governance participation ismore likely to improve service provision where reasonablystrong community organizations already exist and moti-vated community members are present. Supervisoryresponsibilities need to be well dened and focused (as inthe allocation of revolving drug funds in the Bamako ini-tiative and elsewhere). Governance participation probablyworks better for primary care than for hospitals\u2014thegreater complexity of the services and organization ofhospitals appears to undermine the influence of commu-nity representatives in oversight processes. And strongtechnical and advisory support has to be provided to com-munity representative bodies. ACCREDITATION OF HOSPITALS Accreditation ini- tiatives are becoming more common in developing coun-tries. Under this strategy, public hospitals are motivated toimprove quality standards as assessed by external reviewersin order to receive \"accredited\" status.This approach doesnot directly use either policymaker oversight or patientleverage, though it often relies on those forces indirectlyby linking accreditation to eligibility for public funds orby directing patients to accredited facilities. Does it work? Only two developing countries that have implemented accreditation for health servicesproviders have been assessed.The accreditation initiative inSouth Africa has improved process quality, though there isno evidence on the impact on outcomes. 39In Zambia there has been no demonstrable impact.40 When does it work best? Accreditation works best when it is linked to nancial leverage\u2014when it adds tothe provider's \"bottom line.\" successful whenprovider associations are productively engaged andinvolved in developing standards. Substantial facilitation orconsulting services are required to help hospitals imple-ment needed improvements. 41,42 Nonprot providers When governments work with nonprot providers toachieve sector objectives, their efforts usually focus onexpanding services or increasing efciency through bettercoordination. Several approaches are commonly used,including informal arrangements for in-kind subsidies andpublic-private partnerships. But the only strategy that evi-dence suggests may work is service contracting. Contracting initiatives for health and nutrition services have been implemented in several countries. Most initiativeswork through nonprot organizations seeking to build ontheir comparative advantage (efciency, quality, willingnessto cross-subsidize) and focus (slum dwellers, malnourishedchildren, poor socially excluded groups). Implicitly, the ini-tiatives also build on the close alignment of the providers'organizational objectives and the policymakers' goals. Thisalignment is believed to reduce the need for oversight andgeneral capacity of the government in interacting withthem. Such initiatives are rarely rigorously evaluated, becauselittle emphasis is placed on collecting information or moni-toring providers, whom policymakers tend to trust.This lackof rigorous evaluation makes evaluating the impact difcult. Improving Service Delivery | 103HEALTH SER VICE CONTRACTING Government, it is argued, gets more value for money from public spend-ing by paying a nonprot provider to provide priorityservices, such as basic services for maternal and childhealth, and communicable diseases, or by serving prioritypopulation groups in which they have a comparativeadvantage than they would by providing services directly.Services for which governments commonly contractinclude outreach for health promotion or education inurban slums, outreach to stigmatized or hard-to-reachgroups, and social marketing of priority health goods orservices (box 6.6). 104|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 6.6 Contracting health services in Cambodia, Guatemala, and Pakistan Cambodia In Cambodia the government contracted with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in two ways.43The rst was a contracting- out model, in which contractors had responsibility for deliveringspecied services, directly employed their own staff, and had fullmanagement control.The second was a contracting-in model, inwhich contractors managed the district health care system withinthe Ministry of Health.The government met recurrent operatingcosts through normal channels, although a small supplement wasprovided, which the contractors could spend as they saw best. In acontrol group, services were delivered under the existing Ministryof Health system and the same small supplement was provided. T welve districts, covering about 1.5 million people, were ran- domly assigned to one of the three groups (contracting-out,contracting-in,or control),and baseline household and health facil-ity surveys were administered before the contracts started.The sur-veys were repeated two and a half years after the contracts began. What were the results? Much larger improvements in immu- nization coverage,antenatal care,and other indicators were observedin the contracting-out and contracting-in districts than in the con-trol districts, although all districts were quite similar at the outset.The increases were especially pronounced in the contracting-outdistricts. The poor appear to have beneted disproportionately.Vitamin A supplementation increased faster among the poorest halfof the population.And treatment of illness among the poorest half ofthe population increased several times faster in contracted districtsthan in the control districts.The results show that contracting withNGOs can improve service delivery in a short period. What about cost? Cost was considerably higher for contract- ing out than for contracting in or the control groups, but con-tracting out led to a considerable savings in out-of-pocketexpenditures for people in the communities.The cost differencebetween the contracting-in and the control districts ($0.96 percapita per year) was smaller, reflecting almost entirely the cost ofthe contract with the NGO. Because the two groups thus hadthe same amount of resources to spend on actual service delivery,extra resources do not explain the performance difference.Overall, contracting was considerably more successful than gov-ernment delivery of the same services. Guatemala The government of Guatemala contracted with NGOs to deliver primary healthcare services to indigenous populations in mountain-ous areas using three models: a direct model, which involved givingNGOs considerable autonomy to run existing clinics (similar to contracting out in Cambodia); a mixed model, which required theNGOs to keep the same staff and so gave them less autonomy(closely resembling contracting in);and the traditional model,whichwas essentially the usual way the government delivered services. Municipalities covering some 190,000 people were assigned to one of the approaches, and a household survey was under-taken after about two years. No baseline survey was available. The household survey found that the mixed approach achieved the best results in antenatal care, immunization, andreceipt of oral rehydration salts by young children with diarrhea.But the areas in which the direct model was implemented hadmore isolated households with considerably less access to healthfacilities.The traditional and mixed samples appeared quite similar. The mixed model appears more successful than the tradi- tional model, with a difference in coverage of services of 5-16percentage points.The absence of a baseline makes it difcult tobe sure that this is the true size of the effect, but it appears thatcontracting with NGOs had a real impact. It is also difcult toconclude much about the direct approach because it was imple-mented in more remote and difcult areas. Pakistan In a poorly performing district of Punjab, an NGO was allowed to run all the primary health care facilities and implement changes inorganization and management.The NGO was given the same bud-get previously provided to the district.The NGO nearly tripled thesalaries of selected doctors and had them cover three different basichealth units instead of the usual one.The NGO also improved thesupply of drugs available without increasing the budget. An interrupted time series was used to assess the interven- tion. Information from the routine reporting system on thenumber of outpatient visits in the district was tracked over time.No data from other nearby districts are available yet.The districtcomprises 104 basic health units for about 2 million people. How were patients affected? Once the NGO started running the system, outpatient visits to the basic health units enjoyednearly a fourfold increase. The intervention took place in one medium-size district. No household survey data are available, nor are data available on anyother aspect of health service delivery, such as immunization. Butthe sudden dramatic increase in outpatient visits suggests that theNGO was more successful than the government in operating theservices with managerial autonomy. Source: World Bank staff and references 43-45. Improving Service Delivery | 105Does it work? Contracting with NGOs is used most often in low-income countries. In most cases that have beenevaluated, positive impacts were observed on target outcomeor output variables. In Bangladesh, for example, contractswith nonprot providers for the planning and implementa-tion of an expanded immunization program were creditedwith increasing coverage from 25 percent in 1985 to 80 per-cent in 1990. 46Contracting for a primary healthcare package in Haiti also generated signicant increases inimmunization coverage. 47Nutrition services also appear to be amenable to contracting in low-income countries. InBangladesh, Madagascar, and Senegal, signicant reductionsin nutrition rates were attributed to contracting initiatives. 48 Only a small number of cases assess efciency. One found that the contracted provider (Prosalud) in SantaCruz, Bolivia, outperformed the Ministry of Health facili-ties on productivity, use, efcacy, and cost-effectiveness inoutpatient care. 49Many social marketing initiatives rely contracted nonprot organizations to market bednets, oralrehydration salts, fortied foods, and the like. When does it work best? Nonprot providers need to be strong, with well-functioning accountability arrange-ments and internal motivation to perform\u2014as those inBangladesh and Bolivia are. The government needs to becapable of assessing, selecting, and managing the ongoingrelationship with the providers. It must also fulll its end ofthe deal (contractual agreements on funding are genuine)and not interfere with the running of the nonprotproviders,which need full control of the operation (box 6.6). For-prot formal providers The past 10 years have seen greater efforts to harness theformal for-prot sector to improve the quality of care itprovides, to use it to serve certain populations in exchangefor public funding, and to reduce the cost to poor peoplefor for-prot services. HEALTH SER VICE CONTRACTING Contracting in developing countries is most often used to try to mobilizefor-prot providers, usually to increase access or ef-ciency. In exchange for public funds, private providersdeliver services of a specied type and quality, in agreedquantities, to agreed recipients, and over agreed periods.Like performance-based payment of public providers,contracting strengthens accountability relations betweenthe policymaker and the provider and emphasizes nan-cial incentives. But the for-prot orientation of theseproviders means that more rigorous tendering and con-tract management process are required to bring aboutdesired improvements. Contracting with for-protproviders often focuses on primary care services and onprocuring services in areas in which the public sectorlacks capacity and equipment, such as diagnostic servicesand high-tech services. Does it work? The results are mixed. Contracting with formal for-prot providers is frequently effective inincreasing access, use, and responsiveness. In many cases itappears that for-prot providers can also produce contractedservices at lower cost.What is not clear is whether the gov-ernment captures any of the efciency gains or whether thecost savings come at the expense of clinical quality oraccess by high-cost patients. Efciency increased throughcontracting for high-tech diagnostic services in Thailand. 50 Contracts for high-tech services in India improved someaspects of quality (availability of services, frequency of func-tioning equipment),though private payment for the servicesalmost certainly constrained access for poor patients. InZimbabwe inpatient and outpatient services were tendered,and the cost per service decreased. 51But the lack of volume control led to an increase in total cost. In South Africa thecost of hospital services declined, but the cost to govern-ment did not. 52 A weak contracting capacity on the part of the govern- ment often allows the provider to capture any efciencygains or to expand volume to generate more income. InBrazil contracting with for-prot hospitals led to increasesin access. 53But it also led to cream-skimming to avoid costly patients, as well as fraud (false billing for services). Contracting with formal for-prot providers for pri- mary healthcare services appears to succeed more often. InEl Salvador and Peru, social insurance institutes contractedwith private primary healthcare providers to serve theirclients, which increased access, choice, and consumer satis-faction. 54Contracting with (privatized) self-employed physicians in Croatia, Estonia, and Romania has improvedefciency, quality, and use. 20,22,23 When does it work best? Investment in developing capacities for managing the contracting process clearlyneeds to be a central part of such initiatives. 55And quality in the private sector has to be at least as good as in thepublic sector (since ability to monitor quality is usuallylow). Such contracting probably works best for primarycare or other relatively observable services (diagnosis). ENHANCING THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO IMPROVE QUALITY Given widespread concern with the quality of health care services in developing coun-tries, there have been many attempts to improve the effec-tiveness of the regulatory framework for health services and Contracting in these cases was introduced at the same time as the conver- sion from public to private practice and the introduction of the \"family doc-tor\" model of practice. Hence it is not possible to attribute these results toany one factor.facilities. Strategies typically consist of enacting or updating laws or regulations related to minimum standards, espe-cially for inputs and starting a profession or business.Theseefforts are sometimes accompanied by efforts to strengthenthe capacity of the relevant regulatory agency. Does it work? There is no documented case in a developing country of a successful initiative to improve theeffectiveness of the regulatory framework for health ser-vices broadly. Targeted regulatory initiatives (for pharma-cies) have, however, improved targeted practices. 56,57The role of professional and provider organizations in such ini-tiatives appears to have been very small\u2014in marked con-trast to industrial countries. When does it work best? Regulatory initiatives have to target a specic group of providers and a well-denedset of behaviors (overprescribing antibiotics, mixing phar-maceuticals). And they have to be accompanied by aneffective information dissemination strategy and enhancedinspection (the Lao People's Democratic Republic), 57rein- forced by education and peer influence (Vietnam)56and by the dissemination of information (on, say, the use of oralrehydration therapy rather than antimotility drugs for chil-dren's diarrhea [Pakistan]). 58 DISSEMINATING INFORMATION TO PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS One of the biggest problems with formal for-prot providers is their willingness to accede topatients' requests for inappropriate treatment, includingprescriptions. Some countries have tried to address thisproblem by improving patient knowledge of appropriatetreatment and thus changing their demand in targetedareas. Easy-to-understand information is disseminated onappropriate treatment and care-seeking. The intention isthat providers will then deliver better-quality care becausethe demand for inappropriate care declines. Does it work? Some positive results have been reported, though only from a small number of experi-ences. In Bangladesh a 10-year campaign to inform moth-ers about oral rehydration therapy led to a sharp increasein the number of rural drug sellers prescribing it.Physicians also increased their recommendation of oralrehydration therapy, albeit by less. 59 When does it work best? A key issue is whether the problem is grounded in inappropriate patient demand orin nancial benet to the provider.The information pro-vided needs to be easy to understand. SOCIAL MARKETING AND COMMERCIALIZA - TION Social marketing and commercialization consists of a two-part initiative to increase the use of important 106|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthhealth goods (condoms, oral rehydration salts, fortied foods): conducting a marketing campaign for the brandedgood and commercializing the sale of the branded goodfor target providers. Sometimes the strategy is applied toshift consumption from lower-quality goods to betterones. It uses the (existing) market-based accountability ofsellers to purchasers to influence retailers and producers ofgoods. It has been widely successful in increasing the useof important public health goods. 60-62 More recently, it has been applied to health services, such as reproductive health services and treatment of sexu-ally transmitted diseases (STDs). Does it work? In Uganda a social marketing- commercialization initiative improved the quality of STDtreatment offered by formal for-prot providers in threerural districts. Targeted retailers stocked and prescribedprepackaged STD drugs, increasing treatment compliancefrom 87 percent to 93 percent, cure rates from 47 percentto 84 percent, and condom use during treatment from 17percent to 36 percent. 62Another such initiative created a \"branded\" reproductive health service, which attracted11,000 providers. The use of the branded providersincreased signicantly, providing contraceptive services toone Pakistani couple in ve at a cost of less than $4 a yearper person. 63As with health goods, social marketing and commercialization of services is more sustainable thancontracting because it relies on patient payment and isimplemented through commercial organizations. But thefocus on cost recovery makes this strategy less effective inreaching the very poor. When does it work best? Adequate attention needs to be paid to market segmentation to reduce \"crowdingout.\"\u00a7 Goods or services need to be homogeneous, so thatconsumers can easily distinguish the targeted goods, ser-vices, or providers. Other provisions such as targeted subsi-dies and vouchers are needed to promote use by the poor. Informal private providers Given the signicance of informal private providers for peo-ple in developing countries,especially the poor,it is unfortu-nate (to say the least) that very few attempts have been madeto improve the quality of their services. It is widely acceptedthat the quality of care they provide is low, but little has beendone to improve it. In the few instances in which initiativeshave been taken to improve the quality of care of informal \u00a7 Subsidizing consumption has no effect if buyers shift from commercial to subsidized sources of supply.This is the case when subsidized suppliers\"crowd out\" existing commercial suppliers, so that there is no overallincrease in purchase (or use) of the good.providers, the focus has been mostly on training. Several of these efforts have been successful (chapter 7). Some limited attempts have been made to regulate infor- mal providers. One such initiative, which focused onimproving the quality of services offered by drug vendors,was assessed in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. 57 Changes in regulations were reinforced by more frequentinspections, with feedback provided to vendors. Informationabout the regulations was also disseminated.Results includedgreater availability of essential drugs, more appropriate infor-mation given to customers, and less mixing of drugs in thesame package. What works? What doesn't? Why? Six key lessons emerge from the assessment of servicedelivery: The evidence on management and broader institu- tional reforms is not strong. Debate is often guidedmore by political prejudice than by hard evidence. Inpart, this is because too little effort has been investedin strengthening the evidence base. Limited but encouraging evidence suggests that appli- cation of some of the key ingredients of the new publicsector management philosophy seems to improve per-formance. Going down the Sarawak road (see intro-duction) can, in the right circumstances, lead to gains. Institutional reforms may be most effective when more than one approach is used\u2014coupling autono-mization with performance-based payment, for exam-ple, or regulation with information for providers orpatients, or social marketing with commercialization. Efforts need to focus on the most relevant providers, not the ones policymakers may prefer or the ones easi-est to reach.This implies a need to focus reform effortsmuch more on informal providers, who continue to bea major supplier of services in the developing world. The effectiveness of contracting with for-prot providers differs across types of services and organizations. Mostsuccess has been with primary healthcare providers.Success has been limited with specic high-tech diagnos-tic services.And success has so far been very limited withhospitals. Despite the lack of broader regulatory initiatives in developing countries, there is no alternative to govern-ments wrestling more successfully with this critical rolein the health sector. A concerted effort to help devel-oping country governments in this effort is warranted. Improving Service Delivery | 107References 1. World Bank. 2003.

Source: References 1 and 2. Health systems rely on two key sets of inputs\u2014human resources and drugs.Weaknesses in policies and practicesin both areas undermine progress toward the Millen-nium Development Goals. Stocks of human resourcesfor health systems in low-income countries are small\u2014and in some countries emigration and HIV/AIDS aremaking them smaller. Poor management and inappro-priate human resources policies often cause flows fromthe public sector to the private, and from rural areas tourban, increasing internal imbalances. The motivationand productivity of health workers are often low.Problems with drugs include national shortages, lack ofaffordability for the poor, counterfeiting and substandardquality, inappropriate prescribing and use, and inefcientlogistics systems. Policies need to be broad-based.For human resources they need to address compensation issues but also nonpe-cuniary factors that motivate staff.Training needs to focuson skills of relevance to the Millennium DevelopmentGoals,in part to reduce skill marketability.Skills also needrealignment. Relocating low-skilled staff willing to workin rural areas offers considerable scope for expanding thecoverage of key Millennium Development Goal inter-ventions. Public policy also needs to come to grips withissues related to drugs and consumables. A combinationof sound policies on pricing, procurement, and logisticsmanagement and better information for consumers andhealthcare providers could signicantly increase stocks ofdrugs, vaccines, and consumables, accelerating progresstoward the Millennium Development Goals.This chapter sets out the key issues and pulls together what is known about the causes of the problems and theeffectiveness of policies to deal with them. Human resources for health An increasingly common lament in international health isthat faster progress toward the health-related MillenniumDevelopment Goals is being impeded by a variety ofhuman resources problems. A recent United States Agencyfor International Development (USAID) report argued thatthere is already a \"grave and complex human resource cri-sis\" in the health sector in Sub-Saharan Africa that threatensachievement of the child survival and other MillenniumDevelopment Goals. 3A recent World Bank study found that 26 of 28 Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) fromSub-Saharan Africa identify the performance of the healthworkforce as an important issue. Of the 22 high-burdencountries that account for 80 percent of the world's tuber-culosis cases, 17 have reported that stafng problems arehampering their efforts to reach the 2005 targets. 4 What are the issues? STOCKS OF MEDICAL HUMAN RESOURCES ARE LOW,AND IN SOME COUNTRIES THEY ARE FALLING In Europe and Central Asia there are an average of 3.1 physicians per 1,000 people (gure 7.1). In Sub-Saharan Africa there is just 0.1.Within Africa are large dif-ferences (gure 7.2), with Namibia and Nigeria relativelywell endowed with doctors, and Eritrea and Liberia havingvery few. Human resource stocks are not constant. In the 1990s the Middle East and North Africa saw its physician stockincrease considerably, while South Asia saw its stock decline(see gure 7.1).Within Africa,changes in stocks varied,withC\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Nigeria seeing their stocks increase andSierra Leone and Sudan seeing their stocks fall. Hard dataare difcult to come by, but the situation in Sub-SaharanAfrica seems to have worsened considerably at the end ofthe 1990s (e.g., see box 7.1).Tanzania's health workforce isprojected to fall from 49,000 in 1994 to 36,000 in 2015. 5 Between 1998 and 2001 the number of nurses working inthe public sector in The Gambia fell from 784 to 655. 6 Do low stocks matter for Millennium Development Goal outcomes? Do falling stocks jeopardize progress? Theanswer is presumed to be \"yes\" to both questions, but theevidence is scant. A study of infant mortality in Malaysiafound that, holding other factors constant, a lower popula-tion per doctor ratio was associated with a lower infantmortality rate. 8But the population per public doctor was not found to be signicantly related to the infant mortalityrate, leading the authors to conclude that increases in thenumber of public doctors is partly offset by decreases inthe number of doctors working in private practice. T wo other studies\u2014one of Ghana 9and one of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire10\u2014found ambiguous evidence. Having more doc- tors in local facilities was associated, other things equal, withtaller children, but the estimated effect was very small: raisingthe average number of doctors in a facility to the nationalaverage would raise the mean height-for-age by only 0.04(the national average is -1.32). Further, the estimated impactof human resource stocks on Millennium DevelopmentGoal outcomes was highly sensitive to the focus\u2014urban orrural,nurse or doctor,malnutrition or child survival. Such ambiguity and sensitivity of results is not reassuring.

GEOGRAPHIC IMBALANCES IN STOCKS MATTER Another concern is the geographic imbalance of stocksacross rural and urban areas, poor and less poor regions, andtypes of institution. Dakar, the richest and most urbanregion of Senegal, is home to only 24 percent of Senegal'speople, yet 65 percent of the country's physicians workthere:there is one physician per 5,000 people. 11By contrast,the peripheral region of Kolda has just one physician per86,000 people.The problem is replicated around the world. THE MIX OF SKILLS ,NOT JUST THE SKILLS THEMSELVES ,MATTER The skills of the health work- force are often woefully inadequate. Misdiagnosis is com-monplace: in Burundi in 1992 only 2 percent of childrenwith diarrhea taken to health facilities were correctly diag-nosed. 12Mistreatment is also commonplace: in the same facilities in Burundi only 13 percent of children correctlydiagnosed as having diarrheal disease were correctly rehy-drated. 12Even if the correct treatment is administered, there is no assurance that it will be administered success-fully: in India in the early 1990s less than 45 percent ofpatients in public health facilities diagnosed with tubercu-losis were successfully treated. 13 It is not just the skills that matter, it is also the skills mix. Often, unskilled labor substitutes for skilled labor.A recentstudy in Tanzania estimated the required full-time equiva-lents for service provision according to national stafngnorms for unskilled and skilled labor and compared theseestimates with employed unskilled and skilled staff. 5The study found an excess of unskilled labor of 5,000 full-timeequivalents and a shortage of skilled labor of 8,000 full-time equivalents. One interpretation of this nding is thatevery fourth task that requires a skilled health professionalis performed by an unskilled worker. The results of theongoing human resources census in Tanzania and time-and-motion studies performed in public health facilitiesseem to bear this interpretation out. APPLICATION TO THE JOB IS LOW IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES One obvious indicator of low application to the job is absenteeism. Recent randomsurveys of primary health facilities in six developing coun-tries found absenteeism rates between 19 percent (PapuaNew Guinea) and 43 percent (India). 14Low application manifests itself in other ways, too. In Tanzania time-and-motion studies showed overall staff productivity in publicfacilities as low as 57 percent. 5On average, staff was absent in 7 percent of all observations. Only 37 percent of stafftime was spent on patient care.An additional 10 percent ofworking time was spent on irregular breaks and socialcontacts. Staff productivity was found to be related to thedemand for services, which in turn depended on the avail-ability of drugs in rural facilities. Low levels of application reduce technical quality and weaken patient condence in the health system, leading todeclining demand. A recent study in ve West Africancountries identied impoliteness, lack of attention topatient needs, verbal and physical violence, corruption andnepotism, and informal fees as key causes for the poor rep-utation of public health services. 15 Tackling Human Resource and Pharmaceutical Constraints | 113The State of Ghanaian Economy Report 2002 reports that 31 per- cent of trained health personnel, including doctors, nurses,midwives, and pharmacists, left the country between 1993 and2002, leaving approximately 1.48 physicians per 100,000 peo-ple. Bleak as these gures are, they may underestimate the loss.A report on human resources by the Government of Ghanabased on biannual data (table) shows signicantly greater num-bers of health workers lost from 1996 to 2002.The Universityof Ghana Medical School, the School of Medical Sciences ofthe Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and T echnology,and the University for Development Studies Medical Schooltrain about 150 medical ofcers annually. But half of everygraduating class leaves the country within the second year, and80 percent leaves by the fth year. This exodus of medical ofcers is mirrored in other health professions. Of 944 pharmacists trained between 1995 and2002, 410 had left the country by the end of 2002.The prob-lem is most severe among nurses and midwives: of the 10,145nurses trained during that same period, 1,996 had left Ghanaby the end of 2002.And only 12 medical laboratory technolo-gists were being produced annually as of 2002, with no guaran-tee of their remaining in Ghana after graduation. Loss of trained public sector health staff in Ghana, 1996 -2002Box 7.1 G hana 's loss of health sector workers Category 1996 1998 2000 2002 Doctors 1,154 1,132 1,015 Source : Reference 7.T ackling health workforce issues\u2014stocks and flows The stock of human resources in health in a country at a particular time reflects the previous period's stock and theinflows and outflows that took place during the previousperiod (gure 7.3).The outflow includes migration abroad(see box 7.1 on the brain drain in Ghana), deaths of med-ical staff (see box 7.2 on the impact of HIV/AIDS onmedical staff), exit from the medical profession for otheroccupations (ask a taxi driver in Havana about his or herformer profession and chances are it will be medicine),and retirement (many countries in which the healthworkforce has been aging rapidly use early retirementinducements as a policy lever). For the public sector, out-flows to the private sector are a major factor. Inflowsreflect the numbers of newly trained staff being produced,the number of foreigners entering the health sector, andthe number of health care workers returning from abroador re-entering the profession. While hard data are virtually nonexistent, many devel- oping countries appear to face the double burden of lowinflows and high outflows. 1,16-19The Philippines loses three times more licensed nurses each year than it produces.20-22 In The Gambia, the number of newly trained nurses andmidwives is insufcient even to ll vacancies in the nation'smain hospital. 6A United Nations Conference on Trade and Development study estimated that 56 percent of allmigrating physicians move from developing to industrialcountries, while only 11 percent move in the oppositedirection.The imbalance is even greater for nurses. 23 TACKLING COMPENSATION Differentials in compen- sation\u2014both wages and benets such as housing\u2014haverepercussions for inflows and outflows of human resourcesin the health sector (box 7.3). Low wages in the medicalprofessions relative to wages in other professions discouragepeople from entering training institutions, from complet-ing their studies, and from joining the profession if theygraduate.They encourage people to think about leaving\u2014by exiting the labor force, joining another profession, orleaving for another country where compensation is bet-ter. 26Low levels of compensation encourage absenteeism, as health workers seek other earnings to supplement theearnings in their regular health sector job. This createsheavier workloads for those left behind and reduces moti-vation, prompting further absenteeism and exodus. Compensation differentials across specialties influence spe- cialization decisions during and after training. 27Low rates of compensation in rural settings help explain rural-urbanimbalances. And compensation differentials between thepublic and private sectors influence transitions from the pub-lic sector to the private sector\u2014and occasionally back again. Narrowing and even reversing compensation differentials is an important policy tool. Narrowing these differences\u2014between healthcare and other professions,between the pub-lic and private sectors, between urban and rural areas, acrosscountries\u2014provides an opportunity to shift to a virtuouscircle, by encouraging inflows and reducing outflows,absenteeism, and shirking.Thailand has attracted back med- 114|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthInflows Outflows Immigration TrainingDeathEmployment Unemployed InactiveDisability Retirement EmigrationFigure 7.3 Stocks and flows in human resources Source: World Bank staff.The HIV/AIDS epidemic is having a devastating impact on the stock of health workers, particularly in Africa. It has beenestimated that HIV/AIDS accounts for 19-53 percent of alldeaths among government staff in a typical African country. Inseveral countries in Africa 25 percent of nurses are HIV posi-tive. Studies of HIV prevalence among African healthcareworkers suggest that doctors and nurses are at least as likely tobecome infected as other people. Health workers in Africa aresignicantly more likely to become infected with HIV thantheir peers in the industrial world: the HIV seroconversion riskamong surgeons in Sub-Saharan Africa may be 15 times higherthan in industrial countries. Several country-specic examples conrm this bleak pic- ture. In Botswana the share of health workers with AIDS rosefrom 0.3 percent in 1991 to 4 percent in 2003. By 2005 it isprojected that 5 percent of healthcare workers will haveHIV/AIDS and that 16 percent of healthcare workers will havedied between 2003 and 2005. In Malawi deaths among nursesare equivalent to 40 percent of the annual output from nursingschools. In Mozambique the death rate of nurses tripled duringthe 1990s. In 2000, 20 percent of student nurses died fromAIDS. In Zambia a study in two hospitals found that mortalityrates among nurses rose from 2 per 1,000 deaths in 1980 toalmost 27 per 1,000, largely as a result of AIDS.

Several countries haveexperimented with bonus schemes for health workers inrural areas, some successfully. 29,30Other countries allow public providers in rural areas to supplement their incomethrough private practice during ofcial working hours. 31, 32 This can have disadvantages, as it is in the nancial interestof public providers to lengthen waiting times and advisepatients who are able to pay fees to seek private services. Industrial countries can also help.They can raise wages at home to encourage the recruitment and retention of non-immigrant personnel, and they can provide developmentassistance to help developing countries raise wages to attractand retain staff.There are some signs that industrial countriesare taking such steps.With growing evidence that low com-pensation makes recruitment and retention difcult, 26,33the British government recently awarded nurses pay increasesthat were much greater than the rate of inflation. 34 There are limits to what can be achieved through changes in compensation alone, however. Raising salariesin the developing world to the levels in industrial coun-tries (even at purchasing power parity exchange rates) issimply unfeasible. Neither is using compensating wage dif-ferentials to keep staff in the public sector from moving tothe private sector (box 7.3). LOOKING BEYOND COMPENSATION Research suggests that nonpecuniary aspects of jobs matter to people.A recent study in India shows what health workers hope toget from their job and what they actually get (box 7.4). InAndhra Pradesh's public and private sectors, less than 40percent of respondents felt that their current jobs provided agood income. But having a good income was not whathealth workers said they aspired to most\u2014especially work-ers in the private sector.Training opportunities; challengingwork; relations with colleagues; a desirable location (includ-ing proximity to a good school, for example); and goodphysical working conditions all ranked higher than pay inboth the public and private sectors.And many workers feltthat their jobs did not meet expectations, especially fortraining opportunities. People's job decisions do appear to reflect nonpecuniary factors. 26,27A recent study in Uganda found that medical staff in religious nonprot institutions are hired at below-market wages. 36The authors suggested that this was prob- ably due to the fact that these institutions provide moreservices to the poor than do other providers and more ser-vices with a public good element\u2014dimensions of the jobthat presumably give health workers some satisfaction. Pay, in short, isn't everything\u2014what people can do in their jobs also matters. Countries could gain from betterunderstanding the expectations that health workers haveof their jobs and the degree to which these expectationsare met.A recent six-country World Health Organization(WHO) study of factors that influence migration is a goodexample of a move in this direction. 38 There are also encouraging signs that building policies around a better understanding of nonpecuniary motiva-tions may work. A major reason why health professionalsleave rural areas is the perceived unmet need for continu-ing education. 39Retraining nurse practitioners turned out not to be very successful in Thailand, while on-the-jobtraining in basic medical care for district hospital nursesproved to be both effective and sustainable. 28,29 WHO YOU RECRUIT MATTERS People raised in rural areas are more likely to practice in rural locations and tochoose family medicine. 40Changing the admission crite- ria of training institutions can have a powerful impact onthe number of physicians practicing in rural and under-served areas. Programs that targeted students based ontheir rural background and commitment to practice ruralfamily medicine were able to successfully increase thephysician workforce in rural areas. Family physicians seemmore likely to practice in small and isolated areas. 41Rural recruitment and training yielded some success in Thailand.Evidence suggests that the rural service of graduateslengthened, with two-thirds of graduates continuing towork in rural areas after their compulsory years of ser-vice. 28,29 TRAINING HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN THE RIGHT SKILLS CAN HELP RETAIN THEM IN THEPUBLIC SECTOR Training opportunities are clearly valued by health workers. Training increases skills and Tackling Human Resource and Pharmaceutical Constraints | 115In Bolivia the basic pay of general physicians working in the public health system is $440 a month. Over the years, theirsalary increases by a maximum of $65 a month. Working in adeprived border area add another $85 to the monthly paycheck.At the same time, a single medical consultation in the privatesector typically costs $10-$15 in major cities. With limitedcompetition among private providers and the low costs of run-ning a medical ofce, the large private-public salary differentialsattract physicians into private practice, nullifying the monetaryincentive to work in deprived border areas. Source : Reference 35.Box 7.3 Competing with the private sector in Bolivia116|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 7.4 What do health workers in India want most? A recent study of motivation among health workers in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh sheds light on the issue of staff morale (seegure). 37What health workers in both the public and private sec- tors value most is a good working relationship with colleagues.And in both public and private sectors and in both states, a veryhigh percentage (80 percent or so) of health workers feel that theircurrent job provides this. Number two and three on the list ofmost valued job attributes are good working conditions and train-ing opportunities to improve or learn new skills. On these issues, Indian health workers are less satised with their current jobs,especially with training. Although health workers in both statesand in both sectors report earning less than they would like, a highincome is not considered one of the most valued job attributes.Frustration over the discrepancy between actual and desiredincome is felt equally in both the public and private sectors.

It is, however, a double-edged sword\u2014train- ing makes health workers more marketable and morelikely to leave the public sector for the private sector or forother countries. This is an old problem in economics. 42 The standard way around it is to focus government spend-ing on developing specic skills and to let health workersthemselves pay\u2014in the form of lower wages\u2014for anygeneral training. Such a policy seems sensible in the lightof the emerging evidence on poaching and internationalmigration of health workers.The countries that have emu-lated the training standards of industrial countries (such asGhana) have been most vulnerable to poaching by them. 14 In Ethiopia and The Gambia community nurses andhealth ofcers who lack internationally recognized quali-cations are less likely to migrate than those who havethem. 14 Training in areas of relevance to the Millennium Development Goals is a good example of specialized trainingthat is unlikely to be especially valued in industrial countries.The competent training of the Integrated Management ofChildhood Illness (IMCI) initiative is a case in point. It seeksto improve provider skills in the management of childhoodillness, notably in the treatment of the major killers of chil-dren under ve; in the delivery of preventive measures, suchas immunization; and in imparting advice and counseling onfeeding practices and protective behaviors. 43,44The treatment guidelines and training methodology were developed andrened through research and eld testing in numerouscountries, including Bangladesh, The Gambia, Ethiopia,Kenya,Tanzania, and Uganda. 45-48The quality of care pro- vided by health workers trained in this methodology hasbeen found to be signicantly better than that provided bynontrained health workers in several settings. In Tanzaniatrained providers were twice as likely to prescribe antibioticsappropriately. In Bolivia trained providers were 10 timesmore likely to recognize the danger signs of a sick child.Andin Niger health workers' performance (tested against theIMCI algorithm) increased 34-85 percent after training. 49-51 REALIGNING THE SKILLS MIX CAN ALSO HELP Many Millennium Development Goal interventions canbe delivered by lower-skill providers. Community healthworkers, for example, are providing more maternal andchild health and nutrition services. (Box 6.8 on C\u00e9aradescribes an example of successful skill mix realignment.)A recent study estimates that at high levels of coverage,some 90 percent of full-time equivalent staff required toprovide interventions related to childhood diseases inTanzania fall into the categories of nursing and midwiferyskills and unskilled labor. 52An additional attraction of lower-skill health workers is that they are more likely tobe willing to work in rural areas and less likely to be luredaway by the private sector, urban provider organizations, and foreign health sectors. Medicines and other health supplies Medicines and other health commodities are key elementsof effective interventions against child and maternal mortal-ity and deaths from communicable diseases (see gures 3.2and 3.3). Increased use in the developing world of good-quality vaccines, vitamin and mineral supplements, antibi-otics, antimalarials, and tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS drugswould substantially reduce mortality if used rationally. Sowould use of insecticide-treated bednets, condoms, andother health supplies.The successful release and widespreaduse of medicines still under development could reducemortality rates still further.Given this potential contributionto human health, it would be surprising if medicines werenot the subject of an important array of policy issues. What are the policy and implementation issues? DRUGS AND OTHER SUPPLIES ARE ABSENT IN MANY FRONTLINE FACILITIES It is not just health workers who are often absent from facilities. So are drugsand other supplies (box 7.5).This is problematic\u2014studieshave shown repeatedly that when drugs are available,patients have more condence in the public health system Tackling Human Resource and Pharmaceutical Constraints | 117Acute respiratory infections are one of the leading killers of children under ve, accounting for about one in ve deathsamong children in this age group. 53The survival of children with acute respiratory infections depends to a large extent onthe availability and appropriate use of effective antibiotics. Datafrom health facility surveys conducted in 21 countries during1992-97 showed that in some countries less than 30 percent ofhealth facilities had rst-line antibiotics for acute respiratoryinfections.The median for all 21 countries was 79 percent. 12 In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in 1987-88,24 percent of rural facilities sur- veyed did not have antibiotics in stock, and 42 percent did nothave vaccines in stock. 10A report for the Burkina Faso Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper found that nearly 20 percent of facili-ties had run out of essential vaccines and that 24 percent of cen-ters had refrigerators for storing the vaccines that did notfunction. In Tanzania, with its donor-funded vertically organizedessential drugs program, the picture looks fairly good: 89 percentof facilities had measles vaccines in stock, 88 percent had tetanustoxoid vaccines, 86 percent had BCG vaccines for tuberculosis,and 84 percent had diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccines. 54Box 7.5 Lack of drugs threatens the Millennium Development Goalsand in government.The availability of pharmaceuticals has also been shown to motivate health professionals. INFORMATION ASYMMETRIES LEAVE PATIENTS VULNERABLE Providers and drug vendors have a huge information advantage over patients, who are vulnerable toprescriptions of inappropriate, substandard, and counterfeitdrugs (boxes 7.6 and 7.7).This asymmetry makes relianceon nancial incentives to get drugs into facilities highlyproblematic. Informational asymmetries pose multiplechallenges and suggest the need for regulation (ofproviders, retailers, distributors, and manufacturers) andbehavior change (for patients but also for providers andretailers). HIGH DRUG COSTS DETER EFFECTIVE USE OF DRUGS The cost of medicines can be a large part of the overall costs of treatment.As with other medical expenses,the uncertainty surrounding the need to incur drugexpenses makes insurance coverage attractive. The highout-of-pocket spending on drugs in many developingcountries reflects a lack of effective insurance arrange-ments or the lack of coverage of drugs in insuranceschemes that are operating. The high cost of drugs creates another problem as well. The medicines used to prevent and treat communicablediseases are associated with positive externalities\u2014their consumption by one person benets other people as well,by reducing their risk of infection.This makes subsidiza-tion appropriate, since the price set by the market wouldbe too high and use rates of externality-generating medi-cines too low. Beyond insurance and externality arguments is an equity argument. Universal access to medicines\u2014espe-cially life-saving ones\u2014is a principle that commandsmuch support (it was endorsed in the 2001 Doha 118|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthA potentially large\u2014and perhaps increasing\u2014share of house- hold spending on drugs is likely to be at best wasteful and atworst hazardous to health. Studies have indicated that 30-60percent of patients in primary healthcare centers receiveantibiotics\u2014perhaps twice what is clinically needed. Fifteenbillion injections are administered each year. Half of them arenot sterile, and a large share are unnecessary. 55It has been esti- mated that if Integrated Management of Childhood Illnessguidelines were followed in Uganda, the number of drugs pre-scribed per consultation would fall sharply and the cost perconsultation would drop from $0.82 to $0.17. The consequences of inappropriate drug use are not just economic. They include increased drug resistance. A recentstudy reported signicant increases in penicillin-resistantStreptococcus pneumonia , one of the most important pathogens associated with acute respiratory infections. Rates of resistancerange from zero to 60 percent in developing countries, withthe highest rates in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, andparts of Asia, such as Hong Kong (China), China, and theRepublic of Korea. 56Box 7.6 Inappropriate or \"irrational \" drug useCounterfeit drugs are a widespread global problem and a seri- ous threat to health in developing countries. The spread ofcounterfeit drugs is facilitated by weak institutional regulatorystructures in many developing countries and the ease of copy-ing many drugs. According to the International Federation ofPharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (IFPMA), 7 percentof drugs sold globally are counterfeit. Counterfeiting drugs caninvolve changes in the active ingredients, dosage, packageinserts, packaging, manufacturers' names, batch numbers, expi-ration dates, and documentation related to quality controls.Counterfeit drugs are associated with a spectrum of medicalrisks (table). A recent editorial in the British Medical Journal 57reviewed the evidence on counterfeit drugs in developing countries. Ableak picture emerged. A recent survey in the Philippinesshowed that 8 percent of drugs were fake. 57In Cambodia a study found that 60 percent of drug vendors sold antimalarialtablets from stock that should have been destroyed or fakes withno active ingredient.A recent survey of mainland Southeast Asiareported that 38 percent of tablets sold as the new antimalarialdrug artesunate were fakes. 57And the list goes on.Box 7.7 The problem of counterfeit drugs Type of counterfeit drug Associated medical risk Perfect imitation \u2014the same Limited, assuming that the active ingredients and quality is good packaging as the real drug Inadequate imitation \u2014the Reduced ef cacy and, in the same active ingredient but case of antibiotics, of insuf cient quality and development of pathogen quantity resistance \"Placebo \"\u2014looks like a real Lack of ef cacy drug, but contains no active ingredient Poisonous \u2014contains Physical injury or death harmful or poisonous substancesMedical risks associated with counterfeit drugs Source : Reference 57.Declaration on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, and Public Health). Universalaccess might be interpreted to mean that poor and near-poor households ought to pay a low price even for medi-cines that involve no externality, so that the cost does notdeter them from getting necessary medicines or pushthem into (or further into) poverty (boxes 7.8 and 7.9).This provides a rationale for governments seeking to influ-ence\u2014at least for poor and near-poor households\u2014theretail price of all drugs, not just those used to prevent andtreat communicable diseases.They have a variety of instru-ments at their disposal. Because governments end up footing a sizable share of a country's drug bill, they have an interest in the price theypay for drugs, as well as in the quality and quantity ofdrugs dispensed. Through strategic purchasing, govern-ments can exert a substantial influence on the price theypay for drugs. Governments also have several means toinfluence prescribing behavior and use patterns. PATENTS AND THE PAUCITY OF R &DO ND I S - EASES AFFECTING PEOPLE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES LIMIT TREATMENT OPTIONS The use of patents to provide incentives for research and devel- opment (R&D) leaves many key drugs beyond the nancialreach of poor countries.The extension of the patent periodto 20 years under the TRIPS agreement (even the UnitedStates, with its robust patent system, previously had only a17-year period) made this problem worse.These concernshave led to heated debate, brinkmanship by some develop-ing country governments, and exemptions for public healthcrises. The concerns, it should be noted, currently apply to rela- tively few drugs, since most drugs on WHO's EssentialDrug List (the most cost-effective therapies for a broad listof diseases) are off-patent in all countries. But as resistanceto some essential medicines increases, replacements arebeing developed.These new treatments will be unaffordableto developing countries. In 2002, for example, the cost forthe antimalarial drug chloroquine was $0.10 per treatment. Tackling Human Resource and Pharmaceutical Constraints | 119In Vietnam in 1993 a single visit to a public hospital by a mem- ber of a household in the poorest fth of the populationresulted in outlays on medicines equivalent to 40 percent ofthe household's annual nonfood consumption (discretionaryincome) (see gure).A single visit to a commune health centerresulted in a bill for drugs equal to 11 percent of the house-hold's annual nonfood consumption. Not surprisingly, a large number of Vietnamese\u20143 million people according to one estimate 61\u2014were pushed into poverty as a result of high out-of-pocket payments for healthcare, muchof it attributable to drug expenditures. Households in Vietnamappear to have been deterred from using health servicesbecause of high drug costs: having insurance coverage for drugsand inpatient care has a substantial positive effect on the use ofhospital care. 62,63 The high cost of drugs in Vietnam, by source, 1993 and 1998 051015202530354045 1993 1998 1993 1998 1993 1998 Public hospitalCommune health centerDrug vendorShare of per capita annual nonfood consumption absorbed by drug expenditure, per contact (%) Poorest quintile Richest quintile Despite the importance of drug prices, little is known about the prices people pay for medicines in developing counties. Anew approach to measuring drug prices focuses on a range of30 key medicines that address the global disease burden, partic-ularly for low- and middle-income countries. 58Several of these drugs\u2014including antibacterial medicines, such as co-trimoxazole pediatric suspension for treatment of acute respi-ratory infection in children under ve, and antimalarials, suchas artesunate and pyrimethamine with sulfadoxine\u2014are rele-vant to the Millennium Development Goals. The preliminary results of surveys based on this new approach show that in South Africa the price that the lowest-paid government worker needs to pay to afford a course oftreatment with amoxicillin (an antibacterial drug) in the pri-vate sector is between half a day's and a day and a half's wages,depending on the type of amoxicillin used. 59In Armenia the lowest-paid government worker had to work for 148 days topay for a course of treatment with branded aciclovir, an antivi-ral drug.The same money would be enough to pay for enoughrice or sugar for 10 years.The use of a generic drug reducedthe price by 40 percent but still left it unaffordable for mostpeople. In Kazakhstan surveys found that the prices of only 4of 85 drugs were lower than the international median. 60Box 7.9 High drug costs in Vietnam deter use and cause impoverishment Box 7.8 Do we know how affordable drugs really are?But resistance to chloroquine is growing in many parts of the world, and alternative treatments are far more expen-sive\u201430 times more for coartem and 400 times formalarone. Similarly the six-month treatment under thedirectly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) regimenfor people with tuberculosis is $20, while the newer mul-tidrug therapy treatment is $400. 64 Another concern is the low levels of R&D for drug treatment of \"neglected\" diseases\u2014diseases that dispropor-tionately or exclusively affect poor countries, with effec-tive demand that is too limited to make R&D protable.The facts are striking. Global expenditure on health R&Dhas risen signicantly and continues to rise. Y et of the1,393 new drugs approved between 1975 and 1999, only16 (just over 1 percent) were specically developed fortropical diseases and tuberculosis\u2014diseases that accountfor 11.4 percent of the global disease burden but whichare disproportionately concentrated among poorer popu-lations. 65By contrast, 179 new drugs were developed for cardiovascular diseases.65 What are the options for getting drugs and other supplies to the frontline and enhancing treatment practices? CHANGING BEHAVIOR AMONG CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS Providing health education (infor- mation on dosage and mode of administration) to patientsand building trust between patients (and their caregivers)and prescribers (particularly as part of DOTS) haveproved successful in addressing low patient compliance aswell as high levels of self-medication. 66Group discussions with mothers, training seminars for providers at the com-munity level, and districtwide monitoring have reducedthe use of \"irrational\" injections in children. 67Treatment guidelines and training and continuing education forhealth providers on the use of drugs are also potentiallyuseful tools. IMPROVING THE MANAGEMENT CHAIN TO GET THE DRUGS TO THE FRONT LINE In the retail sec- tor in the industrial world, supply-chain costs are as low as3-6 percent of the cost of goods sold in the grocery sectorand 6-8 percent in the retail sector. In healthcare, supply-chain costs are as high as 38 percent of the cost of goods.Some of this reflects a lack of continued investment inhealthcare supply chains, resulting in manually controlledlogistics systems with considerable paper shuffling, lengthyorder and delivery cycle times, excessive inventory, multi-ple product handling activities, lack of information sharingamong trading partners, and an operational rather than acustomer focus. 68Few of these problems are limited to the logistics sector. One study estimates that because of wasteand inefciencies in drug selection and procurement, only12 percent of government spending allocated to the pur-chase of drugs in Africa is used effectively. 69 The management chain can be improved, however. Key measures include: moving the logistics functions from the backroom to the boardroom, recognizing that it is a core functionthat needs to be strategically managed and invested putting computerized information management sys- tems in place that gather timely consumption andstock data and using information to drive the system preparing annual forecasts and revising them semian- nually negotiating better purchase prices through group purchasing organizations strategically managing distribution by reducing interme- diate distribution points and outsourcing the distribution establishing key performance measures to continually assess the performance of the system focusing on driving down the total delivered cost, rather than the unit cost 70 All of this is doable. In Ghana, as part of the Strategies forEnhancing Access to Medicines (SEAM) initiative fundedby the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a portion ofthe drug distribution system was extensively reformed toimprove the use of medicines by mission hospitals. Theeffort has included dovetailing pharmaceutical distribu-tion with other proven logistics systems (such as socialmarketing). CREATING INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE RESPONSIBLE PRESCRIBING Behavior change pro- grams for providers and retailers will have only limitedeffects if there are strong economic incentives not to beresponsible in prescribing drugs. An extreme example isthat of doctors in Georgia, who contributed to the spreadof drug-resistant tuberculosis (box 7.10). PrescribingDOTS drugs to tuberculosis patients offers the doctors,who are paid just $50 a month, no additional income,since the drugs are provided free by the German govern-ment. Instead, the doctors prescribe a cocktail of otherdrugs, at a cost of $300-400 a month, causing patients todevelop multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. This is a classicexample of a well-intentioned policy\u2014to protect the poorfrom drug costs\u2014that has not been thought through. Ifirresponsible prescribing is to be deterred, providers haveto have a nancial incentive to prescribe responsibly.Thiscan be done through a voucher scheme in which patientspresent the provider with a voucher (usable only for 120|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthapproved drugs), which the provider takes to a payer (pos- sibly a donor) to convert into cash. OTHER INCENTIVES MATTER ,TOO Better prescrip- tion and management are important. But without institu-tional arrangements that give the right incentives to all partiesinvolved in drug distribution and prescription,availability willimprove only marginally. Part of the reason\u2014sometimes amajor part\u2014why facilities lack drugs is that providers havelittle incentive to have drugs there. Sometimes drugs areabsent because they have been \"borrowed\" by providers: sur-veys in Uganda suggest that an average of 70 percent of med-ical supplies and drugs in public facilities were appropriatedby staff for use in their private work. 71-73Where providers have an incentive to have drugs available, they often are. InChina, where providers and retailers make much of theirincome from selling drugs, drugs are readily available\u2014thepublic policy challenges are to reduce the prescription ofinappropriate and unsafe drugs and to make drugs moreaffordable.The same story emerges in Georgia (box 7.10). Tackling Human Resource and Pharmaceutical Constraints | 121Box 7.10 Perverse provider incentives and tuberculosis drugs in Georgia T wenty-three-year-old Gia is thin, and his eyes shine with fever. \"Please tell me, isn't there anything to get rid of this heat?\" heasks, sitting hunched on a bench in a damp hall in the Abastumanihospital, 1,500 meters high in Georgia's forested mountains. \"Athousand paracetamol won't get rid of this temperature.\" Gia and his fellow patients are hoping to be cured of tubercu- losis, but they are at the center of a public health disaster thatthreatens Europe with a deadly form of tuberculosis resistant tostandard drug regimens, the so-called multidrug-resistant tuber-culosis.T o blame is the treatment these patients receive in placeslike Abastumani, 125 miles west of the capital Tbilisi. Gia had to sell his apartment,leaving his wife and two-year-old son homeless,to pay for a cure at the hospital after more than threeyears of treatment elsewhere failed to rid him of his cough, nightsweats, and crushing fatigue. He now rests in a wing of the run-down hospital.The myth of fresh, mountain air as a cure for tuber-culosis still holds among Georgia's 4 million people. The Sovietsystem once supported a large network of such hospitals, whichallowed patients to convalesce for two years or more.The systemwas rich in time but poor in medication, giving only a small frac-tion of patients the antituberculosis drugs with proven efcacy. In the chaos that followed Georgia's independence and the conflicts that racked the country between 1991 and 1994, thetuberculosis notication rate tripled, from 29 new cases for every100,000 people in 1988 to 89 in 2001.T o combat the disease, in1995 Georgia adopted the World Health Organization's standardstrategy\u2014the directly observed treatment,short-course (DOTS). Widely promoted in the developing world, DOTS is a simple regimen of four to ve drugs taken three times a week for at leastsix months under the observation of trained staff who make surethat the medicine is taken properly. Finishing the course is essen-tial, as patients often feel better after a month or so, stop takingtheir drugs, and promptly relapse with a tougher strain of tuber-culosis that is resistant to standard DOTS medicines. The hospital's director, Tariel Endeladze, is an enthusiastic convert to the DOTS regimen. But the collapse of Georgia'shealthcare system means that the misuse of antituberculosis drugsis widespread.The government has no money to pay its nursesand doctors, it cannot afford health education, and the market inpharmaceuticals is unregulated.Recognizing tuberculosis as a disease of poverty, the DOTS strategy requires the treatment to be free.The German govern-ment has been donating antituberculosis drugs to Georgia since1995. Dr. Endeladze said patients did not pay for their treatmentat Abastumani, but nearly all the patients interviewed said theywere paying far more than the $50 it costs to treat a patient witha standard course of DOTS. Gia and others said they paid$300-$400 a month for treatment, a small fortune in a countrywhere a doctor's monthly salary\u2014if it is paid\u2014is $50. With cash rather than cure on many impoverished doctors' minds, the uncontrolled distribution of antituberculosis drugs hascreated the perfect breeding ground for multidrug-resistant tuber-culosis, dubbed \"ebola with wings\" by a Harvard medical schoolstudy. Annabel Baddeley, manager in Georgia of the British aidagency Merlin,which is working to adapt DOTS to Georgia's ruralareas, said that unpaid doctors were one of the greatest threats tohealth there.\"Doctors will charge tuberculosis patients who cometo them without referring them to the specialized tuberculosisfacilities and treat them for 'pneumonia' or 'bronchitis' with one ortwo tuberculosis drugs when they should be using four or ve.Thepatients will then eventually nd their way to the tuberculosis facil-ities with advanced tuberculosis, having developed drug resistanceas part of the unnecessarily expensive package they've paid for.\" Patients like Gia are also being treated incorrectly at Abastumani with drugs usually reserved for treatment of multidrug-resistanttuberculosis, worsening the resistance problem and condemningthose infected with tuberculosis to years of debilitating illness ordeath as second-line drugs such as kanamycin lose their potency.Treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is about 100 timesmore expensive than standard DOTS. The World HealthOrganization will not sanction the use of second-line drugs untilthe standard strategy is up and running, leaving patients like Giawithout treatment.They could go on to infect 15 people in a year. Reliable statistics are hard to come by in Georgia, but tuber- culosis specialists estimate that as many as 10 percent of newpatients with tuberculosis and up to 25 percent of patients beingretreated for the disease could have multidrug-resistant tubercu-losis. The structural health problems that created this crisis inGeorgia are repeated in almost all the former Soviet states. Source : Reference 74.The drawback to creating incentives to prescribe drugs, of course, is that inappropriate or poor-quality drugs will beprescribed. Creating regulation and behavior change pro-grams to limit this response is not impossible, but it is noteasy. It is almost certainly unwise to try to solve the drugavailability problem by providing nancial incentives to pre-scribe drugs.There may, however, be scope for changing theincentive arrangements in the distribution of drugs. Somecountries have contracted out the distribution of medicinesto the private sector. Doing so may yield efciency gains(evaluations do not appear to have been undertaken). REGULATING DRUGS According to the WHO, an effective drug regulatory system ought to include a fulldrug registration process, unbiased drug information, over-sight of promotional activities, post-approval drug safetymonitoring, quality-control testing, pharmaceutical inspec-tion services, and certied compliance with good manu-facturing practices. 75Just one in three drug regulatory agencies works effectively in developing countries, asbecame clear in a recent WHO study of pharmaceuticalregulation in Australia, Cuba, Cyprus, Estonia, Malaysia, theNetherlands,Tunisia, Uganda,Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. 76 Some countries, such as the Lao People's Democratic Republic, have no formal drug regulatory agency. Othersrequire only a notication from the manufacturer orimporter in order to market the product, not authorizationfrom a regulatory agency. On paper Nigeria has an appro-priate formal system: market authorization requires evi-dence of safety and efcacy, and samples of the productmust be regularly analyzed. But implementation is usuallyweak because of lack of human and nancial resources.Guyana applies a reasonable, pragmatic approach, makingauthorization dependent on proof of registration by a drugregulatory agency in Australia, Canada, the United States,or the United Kingdom. Developing countries will not be able to set up a drug regulatory agency with the resources and capacity of theU.S. Food and Drug Administration or the EuropeanMedicines Agency. But almost all countries should be ableto set up a drug regulatory agency that can handle the mostessential functions in an efcient, transparent, and afford-able way. One important policy issue is whether the agencyshould be a department of the ministry of health or anindependent agency. An independent status is assumed toallow the drug regulatory agency to perform its functionswithout political interference.There can, however, be dis-advantages in having an autonomous drug regulatoryagency. Badan POM, Indonesia's drug regulatory agency,once a department of the Ministry of Health, is nowdirectly accountable to the President's Ofce. But lines ofauthority are not clear, resulting in dysfunctional competi-tion between the two organizations.An autonomous entitymight not be an efcient option for small and very poorcountries. In such cases, countries could rely on interna-tional or regional mechanisms, such as the WHOCertication Scheme, created in 1975 to help smallimporting countries gain access to relevant informationand establish minimum safeguards. More recently theWHO, supported by several UN organizations and theWorld Bank, launched a pilot procurement initiative toprequalify manufacturers of HIV-AIDS drugs. INSURANCE POLICIES ON DRUG PRICES AND DRUG SPENDING Drug costs are often not covered or only partly covered by insurance (box 7.11).Whether theexclusion of outpatient drug costs makes sense is debat-able. It makes sense for insurance to focus on high-cost,low-frequency costs, such as expensive inpatient drugtreatment. But not covering outpatient drug costs maydeter people from taking preventive measures and seekingcare from a low-level provider as soon as they fall ill.Theymay well get even sicker later and end up in a hospital,incurring large bills against which they are fully insured.The result may be higher costs for the entire insurancescheme.The fact that private insurers in countries like theUnited States cover drug expenses likely reflects a beliefthat covering certain preventive measures and outpatient-administered medicines lowers overall costs. DRUG PRICES AND THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT Governments have ways of influencing drug prices\u2014boththe prices they (and ultimately taxpayers) pay when theysubsidize the cost of drugs and the prices consumers pay outof pocket. Governments can exert a direct influence by reg-ulating retail prices through xed prices, risk-sharing agree-ments, and reference-based pricing schemes. In China,where the majority of drugs are purchased from retailers, asizable fraction of drugs are sold at a regulated price. Governments can influence retail prices indirectly through policies affecting the domestic pharmaceuticalindustry (antitrust regulation, prot controls, incentives toencourage market entry by new competitors) and foreigntrade. The large increase in affordability of drugs inVietnam between 1993 and 1998 (see box 7.9) was duelargely to deregulating the pharmaceutical industry andopening the sector to international trade.These two mea-sures resulted in a 33 percent decline in real terms in themedical price index. 63Governments can also influence retail prices indirectly by making large bulk purchasesfrom manufacturers and then selling drugs at wholesaleprices to the private nonprot sector, as the governmentsof Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia,and Zimbabwe do. 81 122|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthWhether governments sell such drugs to the private sector or keep them for use or sale in their own facilities,they can exert a major influence over drug prices byengaging in strategic purchasing. One issue is whom topurchase from. In the past many governments relied heav-ily on their own domestic industry. Considerations ofeconomies of scale, however, point to purchasing frommultinational companies\u2014or at least from domestic afli-ates of multinational companies.T oday developing coun-tries seem to be relying less and less on domesticmanufacturers, whose share of world pharmaceutical pro-duction decreased from 11 percent in 1985 to 7 percent in1999.A few cases buck this trend.Cuba's industry has beenhighly innovative, bringing $100 million a year in exportearnings. And Brazil recently fell back successfully on itsdomestic industry to make credible a threat to invoke acompulsory license to produce its own antiretroviralsunless signicant price concessions were made by theresearch-based global pharmaceutical industry (theywere). But there are also plenty of failures, with govern-ments wasting scarce revenues supporting uncompetitivedomestic industries. 82 The second issue is whom to purchase with. Govern- ments can increase their monopsony (single buyer) powerby getting donors to engage in pooled procurement withthe government (box 7.12). Governments can increase theirbargaining power still further by joining forces with othergovernments to set up a multinational purchasing pool.Thescope for putting downward pressure on drug prices is verylarge. The third issue is what governments should purchase.A major choice is between brand name drugs and generics.Since generics are sold under an international nonpropri-etary name, there is limited scope for product differentia-tion and much greater scope for competition. This putsdownward pressure on the prices not only of genericdrugs but also of brand drugs. If the generic and the branddrug are therapeutically equivalent, quality should notneed to be compromised. Drugs not subject to any exclu-sive marketing rights, patents or otherwise, such as most ofthe drugs on the WHO's Essential Drug List, are the obvi-ous target of a generics policy. SUBSIDIZING DRUGS Many drugs\u2014even those for communicable diseases\u2014are not subsidized, in partbecause of budget constraints in developing countries.According to the WHO, a regular supply of \"essential\"drugs would cost at least $5 per capita per year. 79This is beyond the means of many developing countries\u2014manyspend this much on all healthcare costs. Donors can help Tackling Human Resource and Pharmaceutical Constraints | 123Box 7.11 Drug subsidies and drug insurance: Different countries, different policies In Hungary drugs are free of charge or reimbursed at 50 percent, 70 percent, or 90 percent, depending on patient characteristics.Generic products on the pharmaceutical benets list are reim-bursed at 90 percent of the price. People on public assistance andthose with chronic diseases receive free drugs, or they are reim-bursed at 90 percent. 77 Estonia has had a drug reimbursement system since 1993 for pharmaceuticals purchased from outpatient pharmacies.There isa mandatory patient copayment for each purchase of drugs. Allprescription drugs exceeding the patient's copayment are cov-ered by at least a 50 percent reimbursement.The reimbursementrate increases up to 90 percent or 100 percent for medicines on alist of more serious diseases, in which case the copayment is alsolower. 77 Since July 1997 in Albania only children under the age of one, war veterans, and people with disabilities receive a full sub-sidy for essential drugs. 77 In Lithuania drug costs are fully covered for inpatient care but are not covered for the majority of the population for outpa-tient care. 77 In Azerbaijan drugs are free of charge for inpatient care but not for outpatient care, except for people with cancer and somepsychiatric diseases.In Indonesia drugs are provided free of charge to specic groups\u2014poor families, schoolchildren, people with disabilities,the elderly, government ofcials, and public enterprise employeesand their families\u2014through primary health centers and publichospitals. 78People not included in any medical insurance system have to pay for drugs obtained from public or private facilities.79 In Nepal drugs are distributed free of charge in public health facilities. Large hospitals, managed by semi-autonomous hospitalmanagement committees, can sell drugs at either subsidized orfull price. In Myanmar cost-sharing drug shops have opened in hospi- tals, with 43 drug items supplied by the Central Medical StoresDepot (CMSD). Drugs are sold at a maximum 15 percent protmargin over the CMSD price.The CMSD cost of drugs has to bereturned to the government budget from the proceeds of sales. 79 In Guatemala the Ministry of Health provides drugs free of charge in primary or secondary health centers and hospitals. In2001 almost 70 percent of the population had access to essentialdrugs. 80 Ghana is currently scaling up for a national health insurance scheme that will include limited coverage for pharmaceuticals. Source : World Bank staff.governments meet the cost of providing free or subsidized drugs. Between 1999 and 2002, $400 million in WorldBank loans was spent on pharmaceuticals and other med-ical goods. In Tajikistan external donations accounted formore than 40 percent of pharmaceutical expenditures in1998. 77This level of support is clearly not sustainable (see chapter 4 on nancing issues). The long-term solution is to set priorities for govern- ment health spending so that sufcient funds are availableto subsidize activities that genuinely warrant a subsidy(such as medicines against communicable diseases) and toscale back spending on programs of lower priority or pro-grams for which government spending is not indicated oris poorly targeted. Donor nance to cover recurrent drugcosts should be time limited, tied to policies that supportthe development of a robust and sustainable pharmaceuti-cal system, and linked to support for the reallocation ofgovernment spending.The World Bank's recent KyrgyzstanHealth Sector Reform project set out to do precisely this:accompanying the $6.9 million four-year loan were a seriesof promised policy reforms, including strengthening thegovernment's drug regulatory capabilities and improvingthe cost-effectiveness of public nancing. 77 PATENTS ,TRIPS ,AND THE AFFORDABILITY OF NEW DRUGS The strengthening of patent rights under TRIPS led to concerns that new drugs would become evenless affordable to developing countries. In November 2001WTO ministers announced the Doha Declaration onTRIPS and Public Health, stating, \"We afrm that theAgreement can and should be interpreted and implementedin a manner supportive of a WTO member's right to pro-tect public health and, in particular, to promote access tomedicines for all.\" Under this interpretation of article 31(f )of the TRIPS Agreement, countries with a public healthcrisis can forgo patent law and issue a compulsory license to 124|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 7.12 The attractions of pooled procurement In Mozambique drug imports are nanced largely by donor assistance. In the past a lack of coordination in drug procurementresulted in huge inefciencies. 83The government determined which types and quantities of drugs to purchase only after adonor had allocated a specic amount of nance.This resulted inunpredictable funding, erratic purchasing cycles, difculties withlong-term planning, and tied donations that resulted in frequentstockouts and expiring drugs. Decisions on what and how muchto buy were offer driven, and drug imports expanded or shrankaccording to donor nancing. After several agencies pushed forrestructuring based on the Ministry of Health's specication ofneeds, in 1997/98 donors pooled their funds and responded tothe government's priority. Currently, seven donors are makingmultiyear commitments to a common pool for drugs. The benets of pooled purchasing are also illustrated by the use of multinational purchasing pools for HIV drugs in theAmericas. Almost 2 million people in Latin America and theCaribbean are living with HIV/AIDS, according to JointUnited Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) gures. 84 The Caribbean, where about 500,000 people are living withHIV/AIDS, has the second-highest HIV prevalence rate in theworld after Sub-Saharan Africa. The high cost of antiretroviraldrugs to treat HIV/AIDS makes it difcult for patients to payfor the drugs and for public and private insurance to make treat-ment affordable. Negotiated agreements between ministries ofhealth and pharmaceutical companies reduced the prices ofantiretroviral drugs in Latin America and the Caribbean, 85but the prices were still high compared with generic prices in coun-tries like India. There were also wide differences betweencountries, with some countries paying up to 10 times more forthe same treatment.Analysis of the negotiations for HIV/AIDS drugs suggests that regional pooling procurement benets not only countries withsmall markets, high need, lack of private insurance, and lack of apharmaceutical industry, such as countries in Central Americaand the Caribbean, but also countries with large markets and anestablished pharmaceutical industry, such as Argentina, Colombia,and Mexico.The use of generic manufacturers prequalied by theWHO allowed for greater price competition and further reduc-tion of prices. The Rockefeller Foundation, Management Sciences for Health, and the South Center recently identied lessons frompooled procurement initiatives in Latin America and theCaribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-SaharanAfrica. 86The analysis identied several success factors: political will and organizational commitment, adherence to a single pur-chasing agreement, secure and trustworthy nance and paymentmechanisms, a permanent and autonomous procurement secre-tariat, harmonization and standardization, good pharmaceuticalprocurement practices, and effective quality assurance. Pooled procurement is more likely to succeed if pool mem- bers share similar economic, regulatory, and cultural backgrounds.Currency, language, and a harmonized drug registration proce-dure seem to be key factors of success.T wo regional groups wereidentied with signicant potential Essentiels andthe Commonwealth Regional Health Community and SouthernAfrican Development Community. Each organization has 16member countries, with 12 countries belonging to both organi-zations.The expected next steps are to agree and formally requestassistance for funding proposal development.

But since most developing countries lack the domestic capacity and technical expertise to manu-facture on-patent pharmaceuticals, interpretation of whatthis meant became the subject of a global pharmaceuticalpolicy debate. In August 2003 it was agreed that countrieswithout the capacity to manufacture medicines could stilluse compulsory licensing by contracting-out agreementswith rms in other countries. So far the provision has beeninvoked only to increase the supply of antiretroviral therapyglobally. The August 2003 provision should encourage competi- tion and make antiretrovirals more affordable to the develop-ing world,but the administrative intricacies of implementingthe compulsory licensing provision are likely to prove cum-bersome for most developing countries.An additional routeto making antiretrovirals affordable is the Accelerating AccessInitiative (box 7.13).PUSH AND PULL FOR R &D TO DEAL WITH NEGLECTED DISEASES One way out of this impasse is to separate R&D from drug manufacturing and sales.89 Industrial countries, donors, or foundations would committo purchase\u2014for a sizable fee\u2014any patents resulting fromthe development of a major new vaccine or drug and tomake the patent freely available to drug manufacturers.Thiswould increase the incentive to engage in R&D on diseasesfor which effective demand for drugs is limited (push),while allowing the drug to be sold at marginal cost imme-diately after approval (pull).Another approach is the globalpublic-private partnership known as the InternationalAIDS Vaccine Initiative (box 7.14). And M\u00e9decins sansFronti\u00e8res is leading a global initiative that would encour-age research and development of drug therapies for mostneglected diseases by developing countries themselves.

Tackling Human Resource and Pharmaceutical Constraints | 125The Accelerating Access Initiative, launched in May 2000 by ve UN agencies and ve pharmaceutical companies,87aims to address the high cost of antiretroviral drugs and to increaseaccess to HIV/AIDS care and treatment. The initiative wasstructured into working groups for country support, commu-nications, and procurement. UN agencies offered technicalsupport on planning for the care and support of people livingwith HIV/AIDS, particularly on how to increase access toantiretroviral drugs.The countries then negotiated with phar-maceutical companies in discussions facilitated by the UNagencies. By May 2002, 80 countries had expressed an interest in the initiative, and 39 countries had developed or were developingnational plans to improve the care of people living withHIV/AIDS. Also by May 2002, 19 countries had reachedagreements with the pharmaceutical companies to supply theirantiretroviral drugs at signicantly reduced cost.The countriesagreed to waive import taxes and duties on the drugs. Somecountries have also introduced generic antiretroviral drugs atcompetitive prices. By December 2002 the cost of the drugs offered by the pharmaceutical companies in the Accelerating Access Initiativehad decreased substantially, in some cases to 10-20 percent oftheir price in industrial countries. In the 19 countries thatreached agreements with the pharmaceutical companies,27,000 people had gained access to antiretroviral treatment,almost 10 times the number of patients treated before theagreements. Despite these efforts, however, less than 6 percentof people in developing countries who could benet fromantiretroviral treatment are receiving it. 88 Source : World Bank staff.Box 7.13 The Accelerating Access Initiative for antiretroviral drugs126|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 7.14 Global public-private partnerships to accelerate the introduction of new vaccines A company's decision to invest in developing and commercializ- ing a vaccine is based largely on an evaluation of economic fac-tors: costs, risks, and timing of investments, and expected returns.T o influence these economic factors, governments are seekingnew ways to assess and share risk and accelerate the developmentand introduction of priority vaccines. They are using \"push\"mechanisms to reduce the risks and costs of investments and\"pull\" mechanisms to ensure future returns. The benets andconstraints of each mechanism, and examples of how they havebeen used, are shown in the table. The role of partnerships It is unlikely that adequate resources can be raised to nance all the costs of vaccine development and production (100 percentpush) or to purchase vaccines at prices equivalent to those paid inthe United States or Europe (100 percent pull). So the public sec-tor must leverage its resources by targeting as directly as possiblethe obstacles inhibiting a vaccine's progress. If the risks are linkedto scientic uncertainty, as for an HIV/AIDS vaccine, pushmechanisms may prove more valuable than pull mechanisms. Ifthe risks stem from the market, as for the meningococcal A con-jugate vaccine, pull mechanisms become more important. Public-private partnerships allow for sharing the risks and costs of developing and introducing priority vaccines in novelways. Several public-private partnerships are accelerating thedevelopment of specic vaccines (HIV/AIDS, malaria, acute res- piratory infection, and diarrheal disease).T o move forward withcredible partnerships, both partners must understand the costs,risks, and benets in order to identify the costs and risks that aresensitive to public sector support. And both public and privatepartners must be condent that the agreements dening thepartnership protect both of their interests\u2014more rapid develop-ment, expanded capacity, and lower prices on one side and realnancial commitments that cover investments on the other. The impact of partnerships Public-private partnerships are expanding the number and quality of vaccine candidates in the pipeline and accelerating late-stagedevelopment activities (ensuring clinical trials in developing coun-tries, influencing production capacity decisions, working with gov-ernments to collect data for national decisionmaking). TheInternational AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the MalariaVaccine Initiative (MVI) have supported these efforts. More than75 percent of IAVI's resources are slotted for vaccine developmentand a number of vaccines are targeted for trials in 2003 in suchcountries as China, India, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. TheMVI currently has nine vaccine development projects in its portfo-lio,with clinical trials under way in Africa for two of those projects. Source : References 90 -95.

Tackling Human Resource and Pharmaceutical Constraints | 129131CHAPTER 8 Strengthening Core Public Health Functions Chang Sun's wife is HIV positive. So is his mother. So is his aunt. So are his cousin and his cousin's wife. So is the womannext door and, probably, so is her husband. In fact, it is quitepossible that almost every adult and many of the children inhis small, remote village are infected.Among them is Chang'sfather, who died of AIDS last year, and his three-year-olddaughter, who succumbed the year before that. His rst wife isthere too\u2014she threw herself down the village well in 2000after a doctor told her she was no longer worth treating becauseshe had the virus. This is Xiongqiao village in Henan Province, the ground zero of arguably the world's worst HIV/AIDS epidemic, withup to a million people infected in this single province through avast, largely unregulated blood-selling operation.The situationis already a catastrophe, but the risks are growing. It was almost inevitable that the outbreak occurred in Henan. Here in the most populous and impoverished ofChina's provinces, life is cheaper than almost anywhere else inthe world.The average Henan farmer survives on 80\u00a2 per day.Henan's ofcials turned to almost their only untapped resource:the blood of the province's 90 million population. V ans wereconverted into mini-clinics and driven out into the countryside.Ambitious peasants established themselves as \"bloodheads\"(brokers) to meet the demand among both buyers and sellers.For an 800 cc donation, villagers were paid 45 renminbi (about$5.50),enough to feed a family for a week.Realizing that theycould get far more for milking their veins than for tending theland, they lined up day in and day out for years to make dona-tions. By the peak\u2014around 1995\u2014Henan had become thenation's blood farm.The system had been adapted so that vil-lagers could give such huge amounts of blood without sufferinganemia.After extracting plasma from each 800 cc donation, thecollectors would pump 400 cc back into the arms of the donors.It is believed that people's blood often got mixed up in this way,spreading HIV to almost everyone involved. \"Almost everybody did it,\" said Chang's cousin, Ming. \"We would sell extra if there was a marriage ceremony comingup or if we wanted to build a house.The most I ever did wasfour donations in a single day.\" The consequences for China will be devastating as many infected villagers are migrating to work in Beijing and other bigcities. GUARDIAN ,October 25, 2003 The Chinese government has started providing free treatment for poor people with HIV and AIDS and plans to expand theprogram next year until every poor person who has tested posi-tive is receiving medical help, a top health ministry ofcial saidin a speech this week. NEWYORK TIMES ,November 8, 2003 This account from ground zero of one of the world's major AIDS epidemics and the 2002 outbreak in Chinaof severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) serves as aforceful reminder of the importance of strong publichealth systems. Vulnerable populations need to beempowered,protected from risks,informed and educated,and encouraged to participate in health activities. Public health regulations need to be established and enforced.Infrastructure needs to be in place to reduce the healthimpact of emergencies and disasters.All of this needs to bedone through a public health system that is transparentand accountable. Thus governments have responsibilities that go beyond providing and nancing health services in attain-ing the Millennium Development Goals. Strengtheningcore public health functions such as policy formulation,monitoring and evaluation, disease surveillance, providerand insurance regulation, social mobilization, and cross-sectoral actions are government responsibilities that mustbe discharged as part of the Millennium DevelopmentGoal effort. Good practices in these areas need to becarefully analyzed and multiplied. It is important fornational leaders and donor agencies to appreciate thenecessity of investing in these core public health func-tions, which are often overlooked as politicians and fun-ders focus exclusively on service delivery. It will not bepossible to go to scale with basic services for HIV/AIDS,tuberculosis, malaria, or maternal and child health withfaltering or absent public health infrastructure and weakpublic health functions. 132|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthWhat is public health? The previous chapters emphasize the importance of gov- ernments building strong policies and institutions across thehealth sector.Without such improvements, increases in gov-ernment health budgets in most countries will have littleimpact on Millennium Development Goal outcomes.Governments play a role in developing and implementingpolicies to lower the barriers that households\u2014especiallypoor ones\u2014face. Households, as users of health services andproducers of health, are key actors in the health system.Governments also play a role in improving the quality andefciency of service providers, which are also key actors.They can do so through a combination of measures toimprove management in provider organizations andimprove the accountability of provider organizations to thepublic, whether directly to patients and community organi-zations or indirectly through interactions with policymak-ers. Because provider organizations rely on inputs\u2014humanresources and medicines\u2014government policies aimed atincreasing stocks of human resources and improving theirdistribution and quality are crucial.Policies to get medicinesto providers and ensure that providers face the right incen-tives for prescribing medicines are also important, as areglobal policies to ensure appropriate levels of research anddevelopment in \"neglected\" diseases and affordable medi-cines for poor countries. These responsibilities are vital elements of the govern- ment's stewardship role in the health sector. But beyondthem lies another set of essential responsibilities of the pub-lic sector: those in public health (table 8.1). 1,2Many of these responsibilities are examined in other chapters of thereport, including nancing health services (chapter 9),managing health services (chapter 6), pharmaceutical pol- icy (chapter 7), and health promotion and behavior change(chapter 5). Several others are discussed in this chapter. Market failure and public health In each of these areas of public health is at least one elementof \"market failure.\"This means that without some form ofgovernment involvement, a free market would produce anoutcome that is inefcient. In many of these areas are ele-ments of \"externalities\" and \"public goods.\" Immunizations,for example,benet not only the immunized person but alsowhole communities, by reducing the risk of others gettinginfected. The same is true of the use of insecticide-treatednets (ITNs) and antimalarials. Externalities also provide animportant rationale for the public health agenda to concernitself with intersectoral issues. For example, investments inwater and sanitation infrastructure enable households toimprove their hygiene, reducing their risk of contractingcommunicable diseases and also the risk to others. Communicable disease programs\u2014surveillance, preven- tion, treatment and control\u2014are classic examples of publicgoods:benets to some do not diminish the benets to oth-ers, and it is typically not feasible to exclude specic peoplefrom beneting from such programs. Data collection andanalysis and monitoring and evaluation are other examplesof public goods. In some cases the rationale for governmentinvolvements stems from informational asymmetries: thepatient, having less knowledge than the provider, can bevulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous providers (chap-ter 7).This asymmetry goes beyond medicines. It arises, forexample, in blood contamination, as in Henan Province. Government involvement is required to deal with these market failures. Externalities call for government subsidies,since without them, caregivers fail to take into account the external benets (the benets to others) of their actions.T oo few people would be immunized. Surveillance activi-ties, research and development, and monitoring and evalu-ation would be inadequate. Indeed, in some cases, withoutgovernment intervention none would be produced at all.For activities involving externalities and public goods,governments need not undertake the activities themselves,but at a minimum they need to provide some nancingand close oversight,to ensure an acceptable level of perfor-mance, given the information asymmetries. Monitoring anongovernment supplier can be difcult, so governmentsoften undertake these activities themselves in the belief\u2014sometimes mistaken\u2014that government ofcials are lesslikely to exploit their informational advantages overpatients. Obstacles to performing public health functions Developing country governments generally recognize thatthese public health functions are important\u2014for makingprogress toward the health- and nutrition-related Millen-nium Development Goals and for health policy in general\u2014but they often lack the capacity and nancial resources toimplement them. Indeed, few low-income countries investin these public health functions.Because these functions dealwith broad health system issues rather than specic diseases,they lack the immediate urgency and concrete appeal of dis-ease-specic programs and thus tend to be neglected.Thattheir influence on health outcomes is difcult to measurealso contributes to their frequent neglect by governmentsand donors.* It is difcult,for example,to say just how mucha strong disease surveillance and reporting system con-tributes to reducing the incidence of tuberculosis, whereasthe benets of distributing and consistently using drugs fortreating tuberculosis are obvious. Still, where these corefunctions are well performed, countries tend to have greatersuccess in achieving their health targets. Why do core public health functions matter for the Millennium Development Goals? The core public health functions complement vertical pro- grams for achieving disease-specic goals (see table 8.3 atthe end of this chapter). Investing in these functions helpsbuild capacity across all of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals, whether the challenge is HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuber-culosis, or communicable diseases in childhood.

Establishing national strategies for disease prevention, treatment, and control By employing skilled public health professionals, govern- ments can effectively monitor the health of communitiesand broader populations, develop and enforce standards,and emphasize health education, public information,health promotion, and disease prevention. Public actioncan improve consumers' knowledge and change attitudesso that private markets can operate effectively to meet theneeds of the poor. Examples are social marketing of ITNsto reduce malaria transmission (box 8.1) and social mar-keting of condoms for protection against HIV/AIDS. Installing government-led monitoring and evaluation systems Integrated disease surveillance, program assessment, and collection and analysis of demographic and vital registra-tion data are essential if governments and donors are todetermine whether policies and programs are having animpact on the health Millennium Development Goals.Box 2.1 in chapter 2 lists intermediate indicators andproxy indicators for the Millennium Development Goalsthat can help monitor progress, assess the impact of poli-cies, and adjust programs going forward. Much greaterinvestments are needed in systems to monitor these inter-mediate indicators. Disease surveillance helps determinewhether health outcomes are improving. Some good prac-tices in surveillance are being developed (box 8.2). Not all developing countries can afford to invest in the infrastructure required for strong surveillance systems. Mostrely on alternative short- to medium-term solutions for datagathering, such as intermittent household surveys, healthfacility surveys, and simplied facility-based routine report-ing systems.In a few cases countries have made special effortsto improve surveillance for specic interventions, such astuberculosis treatment or immunization, while othersattempt to monitor progress toward a specic MillenniumDevelopment Goal. Cuba has made the Millennium Development Goal for reducing child mortality a nationalpriority and established a surveillance system to monitor andfollow up each child death. Some governments, includingthe Dominican Republican, are developing or modifyingtheir monitoring and evaluation framework to focus on theMillennium Development Goals (box 8.3). Establishing and strengthening national institutions and local capacities Ideally, national institutions that implement core public health functions include a national center for disease sur-veillance, associations of health professionals with a stronglicensing arm, associations of health providers with stronglicensing and accreditation arms, a drug safety and regula-tory agency, a health insurance regulatory body, interagencytask forces for such multisectoral issues as road safety andtobacco control,and others.These institutions and large-scale efcacy the reg- ular of insecticide-treated bednets reduces child deaths bysome 25 percent.The Roll Back Malaria Global Partnership hasadopted the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) bychildren and pregnant women as a core strategy for reaching itsgoal of halving malaria illness and death by 2010. In many countries, insecticide-treated nets are available only in a small number of commercial outlets in major cities. Thenets are often of poor quality, and the cost is high ($5-$15each). Insecticide retreatment kits are rarely available. Evenwhere activities to boost demand have been successful, com-mercial markets have not always responded by scaling up supply. Governments and their partners have used several approaches to increase demand and supply. The most common have beensocial marketing and public-private partnerships. In both, gov-ernments and donors have supported demand-creation activitiesand provided subsidies for the purchase of nets, through voucherschemes or sales of subsidized products. Eighteen countries havealso waived or signicantly reduced taxes and tariffs on nets,insecticides, and treated bednets. These approaches have increased the accessibility and use of ITNs.In Tanzania a social marketing scheme stimulated local tex-tile manufacturers to produce high-quality bednets, while thegovernment drastically reduced taxes and tariffs on these prod-ucts. The resulting competition in the marketplace caused theprice of treated bednets to drop from almost $15 to $2, makingthe treated bednets accessible to a much larger segment of thepopulation. Use of ITNs has increased in some districts from lessthan 2 percent to more than 25 percent. Source : World Bank staff.Box 8.1 Increasing the supply of and demand for insecticide-treated netsare entirely lacking or in short supply in many low-income countries. With these institutions and capacities in place, a country can more readily adapt to changes in its health prole anddeal with new challenges as they arise, including the rangeof health challenges related to the Millennium Develop-ment Goals.The recent rapid response to severe acute res-piratory syndrome (SARS) in Vietnam demonstrates thecritical role of a strong public health system. Successfulmanagement of the disease outbreak in Vietnam was duenot only to high-level political commitment but also tostrong surveillance, enforcement of regulations to isolateinfected individuals and protect the public from furtherexposure to the SARS virus, and cross-sector collabora-tion with ofcials responsible for water and sanitation,education, and local government services. Drawing on thisexperience, China's strategy following the SARS epidemicwill be to improve SARS-related diagnosis, clinical man-agement, and infection control. It also aims to strengthenthe capacity of the public health system to prevent andcontrol infectious disease\u2014improving surveillance andcase-reporting systems and setting up alert and response mechanisms to address public health crises and lower thefatality rate should the disease reemerge. Additional lessons on how countries can strengthen the institutions responsible for core public health functionscan be drawn from a review of public management ofthese functions. Box 8.4 identies some of the key lessons. One of the best examples of institutional changes result- ing in improved health outcomes is the often mentioned Improving Service Delivery | 135The Brazil Disease Surveillance and Control Project exhibits a best practice in surveillance and public health partnership. It isimplemented by the Ministry of Health in collaboration withthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDCFoundation,the United Nations Development Programme,thePan American Health Organization, and the World Bank. Amain objective is to strengthen the national public health sur-veillance system. The project trains staff at the municipal, state, and federal levels in epidemiology, disease prevention and control, environ-mental health surveillance, laboratory reporting and safety, andmanagement. International technical assistance focuses onimproving eld investigations of epidemic outbreaks and pro-viding support for operational research in public health surveil-lance and use of surveillance data for decisionmaking.A publichealth laboratory network is being rehabilitated, expanded, andequipped, while the telecommunications system is beingupgraded for rapid and effective data reporting and use.Acrosssectors environmental health is supported by the legal system.The water quality surveillance system has been implemented inmore than half the states. Public health surveillance and disease control activities con- tributed to reductions in such communicable diseases as rabies,Chagas disease, and cholera and to dramatic declines in malariabetween 2000 and 2002. Source: References 1 and 3.Improvements in health failed to keep up with economic devel- opment in the Dominican Republic over the past decade. In2000 maternal and infant mortality rates were higher than inother countries in the Caribbean Region at similar levels ofdevelopment. Coinciding with the endorsement of the Millen-nium Development Goals, the Dominican legislature passed leg-islation that paved the way for substantial reforms of the healthsystem. Within the framework of a provider-purchaser split, asingle-source National Health Insurance Plan will remove nan-cial barriers to access, while a reimbursement system with con-tracted autonomous provider networks provides competitionthat empowers consumers and should lead to improved servicequality. Reforms will be rolled out gradually, beginning with thepoorest province. The objective is to reduce infant, child, andmaternal mortality in line with the Millennium DevelopmentTargets. In an Adaptable Program Loan to support implementation of the reform program, the government and the World Bankagreed on the pivotal role of monitoring and evaluation.Analytical work established chains of cause and effect, linkingreforms with intended outcomes. The exercise resulted in acomprehensive monitoring framework that disentangled inputs,outputs, and outcomes. Key outputs and outcomes were incor-porated as triggers and performance indicators in the loanframework. For example, the government committed to a 30percent reduction in infant, child, and maternal mortality indesignated provinces by the end of the rst four years of pro-gram implementation, when 30 percent of health expenditurewill be channeled through the new nancing arrangements. The government and the World Bank agreed that all efforts to monitor and evaluate progress will be nanced under theHealth Reform Support Project. Monitoring and evaluationcapacity in the Executive Commission for Health Reform willbe strengthened. A computerized health management andinformation system will be established during phase one.At theend of this phase, loan proceeds will conance the 2005Demographic and Health Survey to ensure the timely avail-ability of high-quality data. Annual evaluations of the projectwill be conducted by an impartial outside entity.

Several government actions there were important. Substantial investment inpublic information about public health services led com-munities to hold elected mayors accountable for these ser-vices in their area. Careful control over selected humanresource issues reduced patronage at the local level.A phasedapproach to implementing programs allowed early adoptersto be nurtured to success and news about \"success stories\"to spread widely, influencing nonadopting areas. And therewas strong state government involvement in motivatingfrontline health workers. T aking intersectoral actions\u2014going beyond the remit of ministries of health A review of the evidence for key determinants of the health and nutrition Millennium Development Goals identiessignicant potential for intersectoral synergies (table 8.2).Roads and transport, water, hygiene, and sanitation, indoorair pollution, and agriculture require multisectoral activitieswith the potential to contribute to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals for health and nutrition. ROADS AND TRANSPORT Improving transport of intermediate services reduces poverty not by directly increas-ing consumption of transport but by improving the qualityand security of access to work, markets, and services, accord-ing to a recent World Bank report. 5Better transport and roads can reduce delays that contribute to maternal deaths. InTanzania 63 percent of women who died after reaching ahospital had traveled 10 kilometers or more for treatment. 6In India a study found that half of maternal deaths occurredbefore the women reached a treatment facility. 7 Several developing countries have improved access to health services using locally available resources for emer- 136|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 8.4 Core public health functions and the case for public management A recent review of the main themes of public management literature drew lessons on how public management relates to the core publichealth functions.Some of the key lessons include the following: Curative services, preventive services, and core public health functions have distinct properties requiring different policyprescriptions. Because core public health functions have characteristics of public goods, user fees are not appropriate. Promoting competition among agencies responsible for public health functions does not improve efciency. On thecontrary, it may hamper collaboration and technical assis-tance, compromising the effectiveness of such activities assurveillance and health promotion. Contracting works for some services but not for others. For preventive services that are measurable and discrete, such asimmunization or campaign-based programs, contractingcan be effective. But since measurement of core publichealth functions is complex, expensive, and requires stronginformation systems, contracting imposes transactions andmonitoring costs that make efciency gains unlikely andcan reduce effectiveness. If introduced cautiously and with instruments to ensure con- sistency across units and jurisdictions, managerial autonomycan be an important way of promoting adaptation and inno-vation in the core public health functions. Decentralizing the core public health functions can be a risky strategy, because of the importance of central coordi-nation, oversight, and technical assistance for these functionsand because local governments have little incentive to invest in public goods and may neglect them. Core public healthfunctions should either remain under central control\u2014withmanagerial autonomy or other strategies to permit localadaptation and responsiveness\u2014or if already decentralizedshould be subject to alternative forms of central oversightand control, such as grants-in-aid or earmarking. Since core public health functions are heavily influenced by rules and norms in the broader institutional environment thatcannot be addressed through training alone, efforts to buildmanagement capacity should include components in additionto training. Public sector norms and rules that impede effec-tive administration should be changed whenever possible. Provider incentives are difcult to design for core public health functions. For incentives to be useful, measurementindicators should be chosen carefully. Incentives should beteam based or network based rather than individualized andshould include nonnancial benets. Performance improve-ment can also be achieved in more traditional ways\u2014say, byimplementing merit-based selection and promotion criteriaand clear job descriptions. Increasing hierarchical accountability within the public health system is critical for strengthening core public healthfunctions. Doing so requires changes in the capacity, auton-omy, and behavior of service managers, and it requiresmonitoring systems and instruments. Monitoring instru-ments need to strike the right balance between simplicityand complexity and should be designed for operationalrather than research use.

Better transportation can increase the ratio of health facilities to population.8 Several community-driven development programs havedemonstrated that women's access to health services canbe improved by making arrangements with local trans-porters and by organizing emergency interest-free loansnanced and managed by the communities. 9Preliminary evidence from Mali, where referral funds managed bylocal health communities nanced a system of radio callsand ambulances, shows an increase in emergency referralrates from 1 percent to 3 percent. 10 A 10-year study in Rajasthan, India, showed that better roads and transport helped women reach referral facilitiesbut that many women continued to die because therewere no corresponding improvements at the householdand facility levels. 7This illustrates the need to improve performance in all relevant sectors to achieve results onthe Millennium Development Goals. WATER ,HYGIENE ,AND SANITATION Better hygiene (hand-washing) and sanitation (use of latrines, safedisposal of children's stools) are at least as important asdrinking water quality to health outcomes, especially thereduction in diarrhea and associated child mortality. 11 Increased quantity of water has been shown to have greaterimpact than improved quality of water, 11possibly because an adequate supply of water increases the feasibility ofadopting safe hygiene behaviors and reduces the length oftime that water must be stored and may become contami-nated by handling. And constructing water supply andsanitation facilities is not enough to improve health out-comes\u2014sustained human behavior change must accom-pany the infrastructure investment. So what can the public health sector do? In collabora- tion with other sectors, it can develop public health pro-motion and education strategies. It can work with agenciesthat plan, develop, and manage water resources and thoseresponsible for monitoring water quality and sanitation,and it can provide leadership for action on hygiene educa-tion. It can also provide other sectors with reliable data onwater-associated diseases and the effectiveness of interven-tions\u2014and advocate for water, sanitation, and hygieneinterventions in poverty reduction strategies. And it canwork with the private sector to manufacture,distribute,andpromote affordable in-home water purication solutionsand safe storage vessels. Hand-washing is one of the most effective interventions for reducing diarrhea. Measurable reductions in diarrhea-associated child mortality have been achieved throughpublic-private partnerships to promote hand-washing. 12The Bank's water sector is working with a consortium toimprove the water supply questions on standardized healthsurveys used in the developing world (such as theDemographic Health Surveys and Multiple IndicatorCluster Surveys) to gather more accurate information on thelinks between water and health.The Bank's health, nutrition,and population and water sectors are implementing a jointwork program with the World Health Organization to Improving Service Delivery | 137Millennium Development Goal Target Multisectoral inputs Country examples Key sectors Reduce Improve access to emer- Availability of transport, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Transport, road maternal gency obstetric care roads, and referral facilities Vietnam, infrastructure, health mortality Reduce indoor air pollution Improved cooking practices, China, Guatemala, India, Energy, housing, fuel, and ventilation Kenya health Reduce child Reduce diarrheal diseases Improved hand-washing Costa Rica, El Salvador, Water and sanitation, health mortality in children through hand- practices, using soap and Guatemala, Ghana, India, private sector (soap washing, use of latrines, plenty of water Nepal, Peru, Senegal manufacturers)and proper disposal of young children's stools Reduce indoor air pollution Improved fuel, ventilation, China, Guatemala, India, Energy, housing, private and childplay practices Kenya, Mongolia, health, private sector Nicaragua (improved stove production) Reduce hunger Regulate food prices, raise Improved agricultural prac- Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Agriculture, rural and improve women's income, and tices, tariffs, and trade; Tanzania, Vietnam development, gender, tradenutrition promote dietary diversity reduced women's workload; and food security at the better gender relations and household level intrahousehold decisionmaking Source : World Bank staff.Table 8.2 Potential for intersectoral synergies to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for health and nutritionupdate scientic evidence on water, sanitation, hygiene, and health links to inform policies at national level. INDOOR AIR POLLUTION Most indoor air pollution in developing countries is caused by the use of low-cost,traditional energy sources, such as coal and biomass(wood, cow dung, crop residues), in primitive stoves forcooking and heating\u2014the main source of energy for some3.5 billion people.The health burden from indoor air pol-lution is greatest in high-altitude rural areas among poorfamilies who use biomass in primitive stoves withoutproper ventilation. Indoor air pollution is a major risk fac-tor for pneumonia and associated deaths in children andfor lung cancer in women who are at risk of exposureduring cooking. Eventually, most developing countries will move up the energy ladder, but this move is delayed by low income andlimited access to high-quality fuel. Improved biomass stoveshave been effective in improving health outcomes in Indiaand elsewhere. 13Large community-based intervention trials are documenting the affordability, cost-effectiveness, feasi-bility, and sustainability of multisectoral interventions.Studies in China, Guatemala, and India are under way toimprove access to efcient and affordable energy sourcesthrough local design, manufacturing, and dissemination oflow-cost technologies, modern fuel alternatives, and renew-able energy solutions. 14In China the health sector initiated a large community-based project to reduce indoor air pol-lution in rural areas, after policymakers became troubled bythe leveling off in child mortality rates among the ruralpoor. Having already achieved high immunization rates andother child health interventions, China is now seeking waysto reduce risk factors beyond the health sector.The healthsector is generating the data, assessing the impact of inter-ventions, and promoting behavior change that will reduceexposure to indoor air pollution and complement the pro-vision of hardware, such as improved stoves and ventilation. AGRICULTURAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES Agri- cultural policies and practices that affect food prices, farmincomes, diet diversity and quality, and household foodsecurity also require government leadership to achieve bet-ter Millennium Development Goal outcomes. Agriculturalpolicies that focus on women's access to resources (land,training, agricultural inputs); their role in production; andtheir income from agriculture are likely to have a greaterimpact on nutrition than policies that do not focus onwomen, particularly if combined with other strategies, suchas strategies for improving women's education and effectingbehavior change communication. 15,16 138|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 8.5 Strengthening the health system and core public health functions to combat HIV/AIDS T o achieve the Millennium Development Target for HIV/AIDS, massive efforts are needed to strengthen health systems. In the mostseverely affected countries, the health sector suffers from severeshortages of human and nancial resources.Many health sector ser-vices are struggling to cope with the growing impact ofHIV/AIDS. In Sub-Saharan Africa, people with HIV-related ill-nesses occupy more than half the hospital beds, overwhelminghealth services and other organizations providing care and support.And just as demand for health services increases, more and morehealthcare personnel are becoming infected with HIV/AIDS andunable to work.Added to this is the ongoing attrition of healthcareworkers for other reasons and weakened infrastructure. In many African countries healthcare systems also suffer from chronic shortages of drugs, infrequent equipment maintenance,inadequate logistical support, and weak supervision.Also lacking areprocedures or systems to monitor and evaluate the quality of health-care and to ensure that providers are accountable to clients.All thisneeds to change, not only to meet the HIV/AIDS treatment targetbut to achieve the health Millennium Development Goals. Because of the high cost of antiretroviral drugs, the complex- ity of the regimens, and the need for careful monitoring, specicservices and facilities must be in place in order to introduce anti-retroviral therapy: ensured access to voluntary counseling and testing capacity to recognize and manage common HIV-related illnesses and opportunistic infections reliable laboratory monitoring services, including routine hematological and biochemical tests for the detection ofdrug toxicity as well as access to facilities for monitoring theimmunologic and virologic parameters of HIV infection ensured supply of good-quality drugs sufcient resources to pay for treatment on a long-term basis information and training on safe and effective use of anti- retroviral drugs for health professionals in a position to pre-scribe antiretroviral therapy establishment of reliable regulatory mechanisms to prevent misuse and misappropriation of antiretroviral drugs Only through investments in strengthening of health systems and core public health functions will these conditions be met.

T o accelerate progress toward the Millennium Development Goals, most countries need to signicantly increase invest-ments in the core public health functions,in addition to pro-viding and nancing health services. Strengthening thesefunctions should be included in the Poverty ReductionStrategy Paper process and public expenditure frameworkexercises. Many existing health partnerships and initiativescould contribute more to strengthening public health func-tions by helping build surveillance capacity. In India a WorldBank-supported $146 million immunization project wasinstrumental in strengthening disease surveillance over thesucceeding two years and beyond.The project spurred devel-opment of a new national surveillance strengthening pro-gram, now being implemented with additional World Banknancing. Unless low-income countries strengthen such core public health functions as surveillance, policy formulation,and program monitoring and evaluation, they will nd itdifcult to deliver the basic health interventions to ghtdiseases and achieve the Millennium Development Goalsfor health and nutrition.The key constraints to progress onHIV/AIDS, for example, are weak government systems forpolicy analysis, disease surveillance, and monitoring andineffective policies for human resources in health. T oachieve their goals, national HIV/AIDS programs need tostrengthen these core public health functions rather thanfocus exclusively on prevention, condoms, testing andcounseling services, and treatment for HIV and oppor-tunistic infections (box 8.5).

12 members.They used to be one of the richest families in the village (in Lao Cai Province,Vietnam). Now theyare one of the poorest.They have suffered two shocks in recentyears.First Nha's father died two years ago.So there are now onlytwo main laborers in the family\u2014Nha, 26, and his mother, 40.Nha has two young children.Two years ago, his daughter Lu SeoPao also had a serious illness and had to be operated on in thedistrict and province hospital. Nha's family had to sell four buf-faloes, one horse, and two pigs to cover the expenses of treatment.The operation cost several million VND, but Lu Seo Pao is stillnot cured.All the people in Nha's community helped, but no onecan contribute more than 20,000 VND (a little over $1). Nha'syounger brother, Lu Seo Seng, who was studying in grade 6, hadto leave school to help his family. If Lu Seo Pao was not ill, saysNha, his family would still have many buffaloes, he could have ahouse for his younger brother,and Seng could stay in school. 1 Additional health spending is necessary in at least somecountries. How should the extra spending be nanced?How should the cost be divided between governmentsand donors? Many developing countries spend less thanthey appear to be able to afford. Other countries withsimilar per capita incomes devote larger shares of theirGDP to health spending. Countries that spend less doso either because they place a lower priority on healthin their public expenditure allocations or because theyraise smaller shares of GDP in tax and nontax revenues.Mobilizing additional domestic resources\u2014by raising the share of government spending on the health sector orraising the share of GDP that is taxed\u2014is worth explor-ing. But raising additional domestic resources for govern-ment health spending takes time. Even on optimisticassumptions about the growth of the health share of gov-ernment spending, the tax share of GDP , and economicgrowth, health spending per capita might easily take 10years to double in real terms. Ofcial development assistance for health can play a temporary role in nancing additional expenditures. Itincreased in the 1990s, but overall development assis-tance did not, so development assistance for healthprobably will not increase indenitely. Developmentassistance also entails difculties, including its volatility.That volatility makes it an unreliable source of fundingfor permanent increases in recurrent expenditures.Andincreased expenditures nanced through developmentassistance eventually have to be accommodated withineach country's budget. The sustainability of increasedexpenditures therefore requires efforts on both domes-tic and external fronts. Private health spending, whether out-of-pocket or from private insurance, is another source of funding forhealth.The importance of private spending as a share ofGDP varies across country income groups, but it ishigher in low-income countries (gure 9.1).Health spending\u2014government isn't the only player Private spending absorbs a larger share of income in poorer countries. In fact, in low-income countries, private healthspending absorbs a larger share of GDP , on average, thandomestically nanced public spending. If private spendingwere private insurance, this might not matter. But in low-income and lower middle-income countries, privatespending almost invariably means out-of-pocket expendi-tures, not private insurance. 2In Cambodia, where the pri- vate health spending share of GDP is 6 percent, or in Indiaand Vietnam, where the share is 4 percent, private healthspending is almost entirely out-of-pocket.The same is trueof many lower middle-income countries, such as China. The large share of private spending leaves many near- poor households heavily exposed to the risk of impover-ishing health expenses. In China evidence suggests thatexposure to the risk of medical expenses 3causes rural households to hold more wealth\u2014and to hold more of itin liquid form. 4This self-insurance is only partly successful at smoothing consumption when income shocks occur(due to a variety of factors, including illness).The problemis most pronounced for the poor: for the poorest 20 per-cent, 40 percent of an income shock is passed on to currentconsumption, while the richest 20 percent is protectedfrom almost 90 percent of an income shock. 5In India a study estimated that nearly a quarter of people admitted to the hospital were above the poverty line whenthey went in and below it when they came out. 6In Vietnam health expenses are estimated to have pushed about 3.5 per-cent of the population into absolute poverty in both 1993and 1998. 7In Cambodia a single hospital stay is estimated to have absorbed 88 percent of an average household's non-food consumption in 1997; for a household in the poorest20 percent, the cost was greater than its entire annual non-food consumption. 8The risk of large-scale impoverishment is clearly greater the poorer the country, since poorer coun-tries tend to have larger shares of poor people. 9A country's private share of health spending in GDP may not in practicebe related to its per capita income. But on poverty-reduc-tion grounds, there are good reasons to wish that it were. Government has a clear role. It must not end up paying the medical bills of people who can afford to spend theirown resources. Instead, it needs to concentrate nancingon essential public goods and other areas where privatespending is inefcient, target its limited resources on thepoor, and use its stewardship capacity and resources toleverage private spending at lower levels of care to protectagainst catastrophic risks through some type of poolingmechanism.Vietnam\u2014a country with one of the highestprivate spending shares in the world\u2014has recently starteddoing just this, by providing central government support tothe provinces to allow them to enroll poor and other disad-vantaged groups in the national social insurance scheme. Government spending\u2014what's affordable? Government spending is an important part of the picture,but how much can governments afford to spend? In con-trast to private spending, government spending as a shareof GDP is higher in richer countries (gure 9.1). But atany given per capita income, there is a surprising amountof variation across countries in the share of GDP allocatedto government health programs. Countries that appearable to spend similar shares of GDP on government healthprograms end up spending quite different amounts. A regression of the share of GDP absorbed by government health spending on per capita income provides some indica-tion of what a country could afford to spend on governmenthealth programs (see gure 9.2). Bolivia, whose domesticallynanced government health spending accounts for 4.2 per-cent of its GDP , is considerably above the 2 percent predictedby the regression line. By contrast, Uganda's domesticallynanced government health spending accounts for barely 0.5percent of GDP ,well below its predicted share of 1.4 percent. Countries above the regression line have a stronger case for additional development assistance than countriesbelow it. For countries below the regression line, the focus 146|The Millennium Development Goals for Health012345678910 Low incomeLower middle incomeUpper middle incomeHigh income non-OECDHigh income OECDShare of GDP (%) 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,000 Per capita income (PPP dollars) Official development assistance to health sector Domestically financed governmenthealth spending Private health spending GDP per capitaFigure 9.1 Government health spending is higher in richer countries, but private health spending ishigher in low-income countries Note: The data for each income group are weighted by population size.

Increasing revenues from this source would require consideration ofthe competitive environment in which the companies operate and the needfor reinvestment in the companies.Czech Republic Uruguay OmanArgentina Saudi Arabia St. Kitts and NevisSlovak Republic Estonia Poland MauritiusSouth Africa ChileCroatia Botswana Latvia Macedonia Panama Namibia Turkey Tonga Bulgaria GabonColombia Dominica Dominican RepublicRomaniaBelizeSt. Vincent and the Grenadines AlgeriaSamoa FijiBelarus Salvador MalawiBurundi 012345678 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 Per capita income (PPP dollars)Domestically financed government health spending (percentage of GDP) Figure 9.2 Some countries spend considerably less than expected on government health programs\u2014and some spend more Source: Reference 11. of the health nancing debate should initially be on why health spending appears to be less than what the countrycould afford and on nding ways of remedying the situa-tion. External assistance in such a setting is not precluded,however. Indeed, countries in that setting could benetfrom technical assistance and are likely to require nancialassistance to meet the adjustment costs of mobilizing addi-tional resources to move to affordable spending (box 9.1). Reasons for underspending Domestically nanced government health spending comesfrom general revenues and social insurance contributions.Theamount of general revenues flowing into the health sectordepends on both the amount of general (tax and nontax*)revenues collected by the government (the general revenue share) and the share of general revenues allocated to thehealth sector (the health share of government spending). 10 Low government health spending could be due to either orboth being low. In poorer countries, both shares are typicallylower than they are in richer countries (gure 9.3). But thereare differences across countries that cannot be explained byper capita income alone. Figure 9.4 divides low-income countries into those below the regression line in gure 9.2 (those spending lessthan appears affordable by international standards) and thoseabove the regression line. Countries in quadrant I haveabove-average values of both government health spendingas a share of total government spending and total govern-ment spending as a share of GDP . Not surprisingly, thesecountries are well above the regression line in gure 9.2.Countries in quadrant I place a strong emphasis on thehealth sector in government spending allocations, alongwith a strong emphasis on government nance in the econ-omy in general. By contrast, countries in quadrant III havebelow-average health shares in government spending and below-average general revenue shares. By internationalstandards these countries place comparatively little emphasison health and on public nance in the economy in general. Countries in quadrant II attach importance to health in government spending allocations,but they tax comparativelysmall shares of their GDP . As a result, these countries fallbelow the regression line in gure 9.2. Countries in quad-rant IV attach relatively little priority to the health sector ingovernment spending allocations,but they tax relatively largeshares of their GDPs. In some cases, the general revenueshare is sufciently large to offset the relatively small healthshare and the country spends more than is expected on thebasis of its per capita income (Angola and Zimbabwe areexamples).In other cases\u2014such as Burundi and Eritrea\u2014therelatively high general revenue share is more than offset bythe relatively small health share and the country spends lessthan expected on the basis of its per capita income. 148|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthBox 9.1 Raising tax levels in the developing world\u2014hard but doable Direct taxes include taxes on personal income, corporate prots, payrolls,property,and wealth.Indirect taxes (taxes on transactionsand commodities) include general sales taxes, value-added taxes,excise taxes, turnover taxes, import duties, and export taxes.Theratio of tax revenues to GDP increases with GDP . Low-incomecountries raise an average of 14 percent of their GDP throughtaxation, while lower middle-income countries raise 19 percent(see table).These averages conceal large variations: a low-incomecountry may raise as little as 4 percent of GDP in taxation(Myanmar) or as much as 36 percent (Lesotho), while a lowermiddle-income group may raise as little as 9 percent of GDP(Guatemala) or as much as 30 percent (Ecuador). The small size of the formal economy is a major constraint to the use of payroll taxes to collect personal income taxes.In Bolivia,for example, 45 percent of the population lives in rural areas, and alarge part of the urban population works in the informal economy.As a consequence, only about 30 percent of household income ispaid through payroll taxes.Increasing personal income taxes wouldbe a burden only for civil servants and employees of a few compa-nies and would increase the incentives for transferring activities tothe informal sector. Increasing tax revenues by raising corporate income taxes may also be difcult when there are only a handful of companiesreporting income, as is the case when extractive and service sec-tors are in the hands of the government.A high concentration ofthe tax burden on a few rms makes raising taxes difcult, espe- cially if the owners are politically influential. If extractive andservice sectors have been privatized, international corporationsare likely to be involved (especially in petroleum and mineralindustries), and a high corporate income tax rate risks drivingthem away. Import taxes, especially on luxury goods (tobacco, alcohol, cars), are a politically attractive option. But import taxes can cre-ate signicant economic distortions, especially if imports have ahigh capital content. Such taxes may also be hard to collect.Bolivia has more than 6,000 kilometers of borders with its veneighbors, making it impossible to control illegal imports.Thousands of people carry all types of products\u2014from alcoholicbeverages to flour and rice\u2014on their backs through the borderseach day, depending on the relative prices on each side of theborder. Increasing revenues through tax reforms requires political commitment and administrative will, but it is possible. Boliviaraised tax revenues from 3 percent of GDP in 1983 to 17 percentby the end of 1987. Facing hyperinflation of 25,000 percent in1985, Bolivia, with World Bank technical assistance and nanc-ing for adjustment costs, undertook major structural reforms,including tax reform. It replaced a complex tax system of morethan 100 tax rates (differential import tariffs, earmarked taxes,progressive personal income taxes, and corporate taxes with Total tax Taxes on General Country income group revenue international trade Excise duties sales tax Social security Low-income (less than 14.0 4.5 1.6 2.7 1.1 $760 per capita) Lower middle-income 4.2 2.3 4.8 4.0 ($761-$3,030 per capita)Upper middle-income ($3,031-$9,360 22.3 3.7 2.0 5.7 5.6 per capita) High-income (more 30.9 0.3 3.1 6.2 8.8 than $9,360 per capita)Taxes as a percentage of GDP , by income groupMobilizing extra domestic resources\u2014where you push depends on where you're coming from Countries spending less than seems affordable by interna- tional standards and wanting to mobilize additional domesticresources for government health programs face differentchallenges depending on whether they are in quadrants II,III,or IV .For countries in quadrant II the challenge is to push for a higher share of general revenues in GDP rather than toraise the health share of government spending, which isalready relatively high by international standards.This canbe done. Some countries have achieved high averageannual growth of the share of general revenue in GDP ,though others have slipped backwards (gure 9.5). Boliviaincreased the tax share of GDP at an annual average rate of5 percent during the 1990s, the result of a sustainedreform process that boosted the tax share of GDP from 3percent in 1983 to 17 percent by the end of 1987 (see box9.1).The health sector in Bolivia has beneted from thisgrowth of tax revenues, with government health spendingas a share of GDP growing at an annual rate of nearly 10percent during the 1990s (gure 9.5). Ministries of healthrarely interest themselves in tax reform. But Bolivia showsthat this indifference is probably misplaced. For countries in quadrant IV the challenge is to push for a higher share of health in government spending allocations,since general revenues already represent a relatively highshare of GDP by international standards. Several countriesraised their government health spending share in the 1990s,often considerably (gure 9.6).A challenge is to demonstrateto an often skeptical ministry of nance that additionalresources in the government health budget are warranted. One cause of skepticism may be a misplaced perception that the health sector is necessarily an \"unproductive\" sec-tor. The perception is misplaced because\u2014as emphasizedin chapter 1 and as the recent SARS episodes in Canada,China, and Vietnam illustrate\u2014better health outcomes areclosely linked to economic growth and poverty reduction.

At the same time, Bolivia established astrong and credible tax administrative structure.

Insofar as more health spending leads to better health out- comes, the health sector may be as \"productive\" as, say, theeducation sector. The issue is not whether better healthcarries economic benets, which is indisputable\u2014it iswhether more spending will lead to better health out-comes. Both issues tend to get overlooked by ministries ofhealth, which often view the importance of their missionof improving health outcomes as self-evident and take forgranted that government programs are achieving theirintended health outcomes. Some uncomfortable arithmetic: Raising domestic resources takes time There are, then, two ways to mobilize additional domestic resources for tax-nanced health spending\u2014increase theshare of government spending going to health andincrease the share of GDP that is taxed.Pursuing these twoavenues, how quickly could a country reach the regressionline? And what level of spending would it reach? Table 9.1 shows the implications for trends in govern- ment health spending as a share of GDP and in dollar termsper capita of different assumptions about the growth ofgovernment health spending as a share of total governmentspending, government revenues as a share of GDP , andGDP per capita. The gures in table 9.1 are hypotheticalbut realistic enough to be worrying. In the pessimistic sce-nario A, the share of government health spending grows at2 percent a year, government tax revenues at 0.5 percent,and GDP per capita at 1 percent.These gures are achiev-able, though many countries have failed to sustain them inthe past. A country spending 1 percent of its GDP onhealth in 2000 would end up spending 1.45 percent in2015; if its 2000 level of spending per capita were $10(about that of Mauritania or Zambia), its 2015 level wouldbe $16.84. Scenarios B, C, and D are progressively moreoptimistic about how quickly growth would proceed. Buteven in the most optimistic scenario, government healthspending in 2015 is only 2.8 percent of GDP , or $32 percapita.That 2.8 percent could still be below what appears to be affordable by international standards.And $32 wouldprobably be too little to fund a basic health program. That the share of GDP flowing into the health sector cannot be raised overnight 10does not mean that countries that can apparently afford to spend more out of their ownresources should not be encouraged to start. Developmentagencies have a role in helping them do so\u2014throughtechnical support of tax reform, assistance in developinggovernment commitment to health in public expenditureallocations, and nancial assistance to ease the adjustmentcosts and provide support while the gap between currentand affordable spending is being closed. Development assistance\u2014a mixed blessing Development assistance tends to account for a larger shareof government health spending in poorer countries (seegure 9.1). Development assistance for health is especially Financing Additional Spending for the Millennium Development Goals\u2014In a Sustainable Way | 151important in Sub-Saharan Africa: all 12 countries with external funding exceeding 35 percent of total healthexpenditures in 2000 were in Africa. 11 Development assistance is not, however, without draw- backs.Although development assistance for health increasedin the 1990s, total development assistance did not, and thereis no assurance that development assistance for health willcontinue to grow. Industrial countries show no signs ofclosing the gap between current levels of development assis-tance and the proposed 0.5 percent of GDP . Judging by thepast, relying on continually increasing levels of developmentassistance for health would not be wise.

From a country perspective, development assistance is a very volatile source of funding for health.The ratio of exter-nal nancing to total health expenditures increased ordecreased yearly in selected countries in South and EastAfrica that showed improvements in child mortalitybetween 1995 and 2000\u2014in some cases sharply, as it did inSomalia (gure 9.7). Obviously, then, it is not prudent forcountries to commit to permanent expenditures for suchitems as salaries for nurses and doctors on the basis of uncer-tain nancing flows from development assistance funds. Donors often require that assistance be kept in parallel budgets outside the ministry of nance, which precludesappropriate planning and targeting of expenditures. In2000 off-budget spending was estimated to represent morethan 46 percent of health spending in Tanzania and morethan 50 percent in Uganda. 12,13Although some off-budget spending, such as the resources collected from user fees, isdomestically funded, most is funded by donors, whoencourage this practice in order to facilitate accountingfor the direct impact of their resources. But because money is fungible, once external nancing becomes available for health, ministries of nance may sub-stitute donor funds for regular treasury nancing of expen-ditures,resulting in only marginal increases in overall healthexpenditures (chapter 10).This is especially so in countries0%10%20%30%40%50%60% 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000Development assistance for health as share of government health expenditures Burundi Comoros Eritrea Ethiopia Somalia Uganda TanzaniaFigure 9.7 Importance of external nancing in total health expenditures in selected countries inSub-Saharan Africa Source: Reference 11.Financing Additional Spending for the Millennium Development Goals\u2014In a Sustainable Way | 153operating under strict budget constraints, where increased expenditures in many sectors have been suppressed forsome time. As resources from abroad become available forhealth, political pressures are likely to divert resources pre-viously available to health to other uses. So a simple assess-ment of the impact of external resources on outputs or thepurchase of additional inputs does not take into accountthe impact of reduced resources from regular budgets. Off-budget expenditures in health may partly explain the low government expenditures in some countries, such asUganda. Moreover, off-budget expenditures make it impos-sible to properly target resources to particular interventions,geographic locations, or population groups. Such targetingmay be essential for improving the impact of expenditureson outcomes and for reaching the health MillenniumDevelopment Goals, as explained in chapter 4. Most important, spending commitments in the health sector must be permanent. This means that any externalnancing must eventually be replaced by additional domes-tic revenues or by reallocating expenditures from other sec-tors. Because both these policy measures are difcult toimplement, countries must carefully analyze the commit-ments they make to their populations on the basis of tempo-rary external nancing. Sustainability of health expenditures\u2014a dim picture? A dim picture of the sustainability of additional health expenditures can emerge from some of the main messagesof this chapter and chapter 4: Health outcomes are influenced by multiple factors, many of them outside the health sector, such as accessto roads and clean water, and requiring additionalinvestment. Not all the Millennium Development Goals are for health, and countries have many other priorities. Raising additional domestic revenues requires increased capacity and takes time. Development assistance has not increased to expected levels and may be volatile at the country level, soexpenditures nanced with such funding must even-tually be accommodated within each country's budgetconstraints. In discussing resource mobilization\u2014whether domestic or external\u2014a sense of realism needs to be maintained.Allcountries face budget constraints. They are more difcultto live with in low-income countries with limited capacityto increase tax revenues and relatively inflexible expendi-tures.The possibility of accommodating increased expendi-tures in health diminishes when economies are in a down-turn and facing decreased tax revenues (as many countriesin Latin America and the Caribbean are) or when theyhave to reduce the overall nonnancial public sector decitin order to be scally prudent, meet regional commitments(such as joining the European Union), meet commitmentsto International Monetary Fund programs, or maintaininternational credit ratings. Commitments outside thehealth sector also need to be kept in mind. Expendituresthat improve health outcomes\u2014such as infrastructure pro-jects crucial for enabling people to get to health facilities\u2014may even have to be increased. All expenditures must beconsidered to avoid excessive leveraging at the countrylevel that would threaten scal sustainability (maintaining acountry's debt-to-GDP ratios and liquidity requirementsfor debt service). While difcult, the prospects for achieving sustainable health expenditures are not necessarily bleak. Fiscal sustain-ability implies working on all fronts of the scal decit:raising tax revenues, reallocating expenditures across thebudget, and increasing donor funding in the form of grantsor other forms that may be registered as part of the revenuestream. The issues point to a range of tasks that require ajoint effort by developing countries and donors. What needs to be done domestically Low spenders need to increase resources for health by rais-ing taxes, raising allocations to health, or both. All coun-tries need to strive for good-quality Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers and medium-term expenditure frame-works.They need to align targets and goals with resources.They need to manage resources through improved publicexpenditure management systems, focus resources at themargin on programs that will have the largest impact onoutcomes, and improve the impact of expenditures onoutcomes through appropriate targeting of interventionsand population groups. As indicated in chapter 4, policiesand institutions in the health sector need improving.Countries need to nd mechanisms for pooling out-of-pocket expenditures and expand the nancial envelopebeyond scal efforts. What donors need to do Donors need to make good on the promise of increasednancing. Development assistance needs to be timely andpredictable, so that it can be used to nance carefullyplanned recurrent expenditures that may eventually becovered by domestic nancing. Donors need to improvecoordination among themselves, eliminating off-budgetnancing, for example, which inhibits appropriate countrybudgeting and targeting.154|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthReferences 1.

It can be effective in coun-tries with sound policies and institutions. But incountries with weak policies and institutions, it has littleimpact on health outcomes. Recent work on develop-ment effectiveness yields other important lessons, too.Conditionality can work\u2014but only if governments arecommitted to the conditions they agree to. Donors can-not force policies on governments, but they can helpdesign them. And aid is at least partially fungible, withgovernments shifting their spending patterns in responseto donor allocations. These and other lessons have spurred interest at the World Bank and among other donors in broader devel-opment assistance mechanisms, such as sectorwide pro-grams and poverty reduction support credits, which aimto have countries leading donor coordination, withstrategic coherence ensured through a PovertyReduction Strategy Paper. T o be effective, the strategyshould contain a careful analysis of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and be linked rmly to outcomes.The related nancial coherence then needs to beexpressed in the medium-term expenditure framework.A practical lesson for donors is to work more closelywith each other and with governments to ensure that thenumber of country coordination bodies for health is lim-ited, that resources are pooled, and that aid is untied toprocurement only from the country of origin of thefunding.Also needed is a common framework for report-ing and assessing progress, with a commitment to learnfrom it and make appropriate policy adjustments. Are the lessons of development assistance being learned and applied in practice? They appear to be. Inthe World Bank's analytical work, policy dialogue, andnancial operations over the past 18 months are manypositive signs of change. The previous chapters point to the many actions developing country governments can take to acceleratethe pace of progress on the Millennium DevelopmentGoals for health while ensuring that much of the benetaccrues to the poorest and most disadvantaged house-holds.At the same time, the many international partnersto health and nutrition\u2014bilateral and multilateral agen-cies, philanthropic organizations, and transnational com-panies\u2014have a heavy responsibility to assist.This chapterassesses the track record of development assistance tohealth, outlines the lessons learned, and reviews somerecent attempts to improve the effectiveness of develop-ment assistance to health and its contribution to meetingthe health goals. It also reviews the Bank's responses tothe Millennium Development Goal challenge\u2014how theBank's commitment to the goals has influenced its ana-lytical work, its dialogue with and technical assistance tocountries, its country assistance strategies, its lendingactivities, and its work on monitoring and evaluation.The review highlights breakthroughs and promising new approaches and identies continuing constraints to betterperformance. At the High-Level Forum on the Millennium Devel- opment Goals for health held in Geneva in January 2004,a wide variety of actors\u2014donors, international technicalagencies, philanthropists, and developing countries\u2014agreed broadly on a number of points.They agreed thatthe Millennium Development Goals for health indeedpose formidable challenges and that it is vital for all torise to those challenges.They agreed that a greater senseof urgency is required if 2015 is not to pass by with alarge number of countries having missed the targets.Andthey agreed on actions to mobilize resources for health,to enhance aid effectiveness and harmonization, toincrease human resources, and to monitor performance. 156|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthDevelopment assistance to health\u2014 what have we learned? Despite a decline in overall ofcial development assistance, development assistance to health rose in real terms and as aproportion of ofcial development assistance in the 1990s(gure 10.1). 1With new funding sources for health in 2000-02\u2014including the Bill and Melinda Gates Founda-tion; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis andMalaria; the special U.S. nancing for HIV/AIDS; andWorld Bank International Development Association (IDA)grants\u2014commitments from all external sources includingfoundations rose from an average of $6.4 billion in1997-99 to about $8.1 billion in 2002.* And funding canbe expected to continue to rise in the coming years. 2 What has development assistance to health achieved in recent years? Can this money be spent in a way that willhave a greater impact on health outcomes? What are some of the lessons of experience that can be carried forward asthe external nancing envelope expands? Development assistance to health works\u2014 in a good policy environment Development assistance to health supports a vast array of activities and services, some focused on specic diseases(polio, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS); some on strengtheninghealth systems (disease surveillance, training nurses and mid-wives); and some on particular services (reproductive andchild health services). Did this assistance actually changehealth outcomes? Recent work from the World Bank sug-gests that it did. 3,4But development assistance to health does not improve health outcomes in countries where the policyenvironment is poor. 4With \"good\" policies and institutions (strong property rights, little corruption, an efcient bureau-cracy), an extra 1 percent of GDP in aid is estimated to havelead to a decline in infant mortality of 0.9 percent. By con-trast, where policies were only average, the decline was only0.4 percent. And where policies were poor, aid is estimatedto have had no signicant effect on infant mortality. Corroborating the nding that aid has little or no effect if policies and institutions are poor is the World Bank's experi-ence with projects. Numerous evaluation studies, develop-ment effectiveness reports, implementation completionreports, and quality reviews demonstrate that the majorweaknesses in the use of development assistance to healtharise from institutional issues. Projects are more likely tohave a development impact if adequate institutional analysisis undertaken before a health sector operation is approved, ifclear institutional lines of responsibility are established, andif implementation is entrusted to a strong team. This nding is influencing IDA allocations, which are no longer based only on per capita income but also onBank staff assessments of countries' policies and institu-tions. A similar approach is being followed at the subna-tional level. The Bank's country assistance strategy forIndia over the past ve years has focused on a few states,such as Andra Pradesh and Karnataka. These states have* The International Development Association provides \"credits\" to the world's poorest countries\u2014loans at zero interest with a 10 year grace periodand maturities of 35-40 years.

But the productivity of aid is not a black-and-white issue.There are graduations of good policy, and as policygets better the productivity of aid increases. Improvinggovernance can enable countries to get more out of healthspending. In Bangladesh, for example, an additional dollarof government health spending spent after improvementsin governance are made is estimated to reduce under-vemortality by 14 percent; without such improvements,under-ve mortality would fall just 9 percent. Bangladeshhas made large strides in reducing child mortality in recentyears,relying on nongovernmental organizations to delivermany services. Raising the quality of governance frombelow average to above average (based on the internation-ally agreed governance index) would allow it to reap gainsmore quickly at given levels of public spending. 5 There may be a tradeoff between targeting assistance on the neediest countries and achieving the greatest impact fromdevelopment assistance to health. But if there is, it is not anall-or-nothing decision: countries need not move from \"bad\"policies to \"excellent\" policies in order for aid to be justied.And in countries with weak policies, a focus by donors onpolicy dialogue and technical assistance to improve the envi-ronment for development assistance to health can set thestage for a larger infusion of nancial support.Aid can help improve health policies\u2014under certain conditions Conditionality can work\u2014if country commitment is in place.T ying aid to policy changes is a common practice,butrecent studies have cast doubt on the ability of conditionsto bring about reform. 6If governments are committed to reform, conditions can help\u2014by enabling governments tocommit publicly to certain reforms and persuade privateinvestors of their seriousness. But if governments are notcommitted to reform, conditions will not make themreform, often because disbursements continue anyway. Donors cannot force policies on governments\u2014but they can help design policy. Donors can alert governmentsto the reasons for reform and help nurture commitment.But at the end of the day, it is governments that have tosustain it (box 10.1).Analytical work, training and techni-cal assistance, disseminating ideas about policy reform anddevelopment, and stimulating debate in civil society can allbe valuable activities for donors to support while the gov-ernment's commitment to reform is growing. Vietnam in the late 1980s and early 1990s is a good exam- ple. At a landmark meeting in 1986, the ruling communistparty decided to break with the past and introduce sweepingeconomic reforms. In the health sector this included intro-ducing user fees at public facilities, legalizing private medi-cine, deregulating the pharmaceutical industry, and openingthe pharmaceuticals and medical equipment industries to Applying the Lessons of Development Assistance for Health | 157Nutrition has not made it to the national political agenda in most countries, because nutrition advocates have not succeeded inlinking improved nutrition with political and economic goals orcreating popular demand to eliminate malnutrition. Can donorshelp? In Bangladesh, UNICEF and the Bank partnered with thegovernment to present the case that the country could notachieve its economic goals without reducing malnutrition.Theypersuaded policymakers that funding a national nutrition pro-gram was a good investment, and a new nutrition project wasapproved in 1995. But commitment is often fragile, and carefuland continuing efforts are needed to sustain the initial commit-ment through changes in political scenarios. The issue is not just how to build initial commitment, but how to broaden and maintain commitment and complement itwith systematic investments in institutional capacity develop-ment. The rst nutrition investment in Bangladesh was woundup in 2001. Child care and health-seeking behaviors improvedsubstantially in project areas, and malnutrition rates in the coun-try declined. A new follow-on nutrition investment wasapproved, but is struggling in the challenging policy environ- ment for social sectors. Contradictory messages from donors andother partners, and frequent changes in governmental portfolios,have added to the challenge. In Thailand, commitment-building for nutrition was achieved and nurtured with little external support. It generated commit-ment for nutrition by building a wide consensus (among the gov-ernment, nongovernmental organizations\u2014NGOs\u2014and theprivate sector) around the benets of nutrition\u2014not as a welfareissue but as a human development issue.This initial commitmentwas sustained by ensuring that policy statements were closelylinked to national investment plans, building strong technical andmanagerial capacity for nutrition in the country (often throughexternal aid), and linking these actions with a strong buy-in anddemand from communities. Malnutrition rates in Thailanddeclined from 51 percent in the early 1980s to 18 percent in1990. Source: World Bank staff.Box 10.1 The importance of country commitment: How Bangladesh and Thailand have fared in reducing malnutritioninternational trade. Initially,Vietnam saw no increase in aid. But institutions such as the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and the World Bank helped facilitate the reformprocess by organizing international workshops for theVietnamese to exchange ideas on policy with their neigh-bors.This set the stage for a large inflow of donor nancing,starting about 1995 and continuing to the present. Donors can support innovative nancing mechanisms to improve performance by linking disbursements to specicperformance measures, including better policies.This is thetack taken by the Global Fund for AIDS,Tuberculosis andMalaria.And it is one way the Global Alliance for Vaccinesand Immunization disburses its funds to countries, using aper capita payment for each additional child fully vacci-nated against a target schedule.Recent programmatic socialadjustment loans to Peru and Brazil by the World Bank linkdisbursement of large single tranches of funding to policychanges targeting public health spending toward the poor.Performance-based lending is also at the heart of the newscheme for IDA credit buy-downs for polio (box 10.2).The fungibility in development assistance to health is substantial Much aid is earmarked\u2014both across sectors and within them. One part of a development agency gives a grant tothe ministry of health for a health sector reform whileanother does the same for a primary education project.One agency makes a loan to the ministry of health for atuberculosis project while another makes a loan for amalaria control project. The intention of donors is thatthese activities remain tightly sealed\u2014the health sectorreform funds are to be kept separate from the primaryeducation project funds, and the tuberculosis project fundsare to be kept separate from the malaria control projectfunds.The idea is to ensure that the government makes acertain spending choice that it would not have made hadit been handed a check for the same amount. One view of aid is what-you-see-is-what-you-get: a government receives $1 million for a water project, andthe net impact is $1 million worth of extra spending onthe water sector.This view has recently been challenged,on the grounds that aid is fungible\u2014at least partially.Where aid is not fungible, the recipient governmentincreases spending on the health sector by an amountequal to the aid. For each dollar of aid to the health sector,government health spending rises by a dollar. The otherextreme is where aid is fully fungible.The recipient gov-ernment treats the extra dollar of aid as if it represented anextra dollar of government revenue, and it increases itsspending in the health sector by whatever amount itincreases its health spending when its own revenues rise bya dollar.The intermediate position is incomplete fungibil-ity\u2014government spending on health rises by less than adollar but by more than it would if the governmentreceived an extra dollar in its overall budget. Assessing whether aid is indeed fungible is not straight- forward. The difculty is knowing how the governmentwould have responded if its own resources had increased bythe amount of the aid, or equivalently if it had received acheck for the same amount. Recent research suggests thatwhile an extra dollar of development assistance does result inan extra dollar of government spending in some countries,inmany it does not. 6Where it does, only 29 cents of the addi- tional dollar of aid goes into government development pro-grams\u2014the rest leaks out into nondevelopment programs,though not apparently into reduced tax effort. So ofcialdevelopment assistance at the level of overall governmentspending is fungible\u2014the average government spends anadditional dollar in exactly the same way, irrespective ofwhether it comes from domestic resources or from a donor. Research also suggests that aid in many countries is fungi- ble across sectors within the government's development 158|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthT o ensure nancing for the Millennium Development Goals, governments, foundations, agencies, and development banks areall exploring new nancing approaches that have the potentialto increase resource flows, adjust the concessionality of fundingwhere appropriate, and help focus more attention on impact. The IDA credit buy-down mechanism was recently piloted in several projects supporting polio eradication, clearly a global pub-lic good.The mechanism enhances the concessionality of IDA'sassistance in priority areas, mobilizes additional resources fromexternal partners, and focuses the attention of governments, part-ners,and Bank staff on clearly dened performance objectives. T wo projects\u2014in Nigeria and Pakistan\u2014were implemented in scal 2003, in partnership with the Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation, Rotary International, and the United NationsFoundation. The partnerships will buy down a country's IDAloans on successful completion of the country's polio eradica-tion program. Because of the generous loan terms, each grantdollar unlocks roughly $2.50 for countries to ght polio. T ofund the buy-downs, the partnership has established a trust fundwith $25 million from the Gates Foundation and $25 millionfrom Rotary International and the United Nations Foundation.This $50 million investment has the potential to buy downroughly $125 million in World Bank IDA loans. In this way,developing countries can mobilize what ultimately becomesgrant funding to eradicate polio\u2014and contribute beyond theirborders to the global campaign to eliminate polio. Source: World Bank staff.Box 10.2 Helping eradicate polio through IDA credit buy-downs program\u2014aid intended for the health sector gets spent on other development sectors, and aid intended for other devel-opment sectors gets spent on health. Fungibility implies, forexample, that when development assistance to health is ear-marked for primary health services and excludes tertiarycare, governments simply focus their resources on health ser-vices for the population served by public hospitals\u2014awealthier,urban population in many poor countries. One important implication is that donors should not spend time and effort trying to channel their external fund-ing to specic programs for certain priority diseases andpopulations, without engaging in a dialogue with the gov-ernment on basic changes in the overall patterns of publicspending for health\u2014the total allocation and the amountsallocated to, say, child health and communicable diseasecontrol services or improving community and primary levelhealth delivery systems. If these basic changes were enacted,donors would then transfer their nancial assistance to thehealth sector as a whole, knowing that they are likely tohave a positive impact on Millennium Development Goaloutcomes. The transactions costs of aid are still too high In a single low-income country, more than 20 donors\u2014including bilaterals, multilaterals, global programs, founda-tions, and large NGOs\u2014can be involved in health. Thedemands placed on recipient countries can be huge, asdonors are starting to acknowledge. They are recognizingthat their individual procedures for reporting, accounting,and managing funds\u2014often encompassing different budgetstructures,ways of measuring progress toward objectives,reg-ulations for the procurement of goods, services and works,and approaches and cycles to disbursing funds\u2014place heavyand unreasonable demands on recipient countries. This isparticularly so in poor countries forced to allocate limitedhuman resources away from managing service delivery to managing donors. Donors have also learned that individual project man- agement units have not made sustainable contributions.They have sometimes run parallel to local structures.Theyhave also fostered a sense that the project staff are moreaccountable to the nancier than the government. Andthey have redirected the most qualied human resourcesaway from gover nment employment toward employment in development assistance agencies. There is a need to enhance coordination, explicitly pool aid, and put countries in the driver's seat There is a growing view that if aid is indeed fungible and earmarking imposes transactions costs on recipient coun-tries,donors should dispense with the ction that donors canidentify what their money buys. This recognition hasencouraged donors to search for broader development assis-tance mechanisms that recognize the importance of theentire expenditure program.These mechanisms range fromthe Multi-Country AIDS Program in Africa, which supportsnational HIV/AIDS strategies, to sectorwide approaches inhealth to poverty reduction support credits, which back abroad public spending agenda.In several countries,includingEthiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania andUganda, these principles have improved country-level coor-dination of development assistance to health. Some key ele-ments include the following: ensuring that countries, not donors, drive the coordi- nation ensuring strategic coherence, as expressed in the poverty reduction strategy and the health, nutrition,and population analysis that feeds into it ensuring nancial coherence through a medium-term expenditure framework and an agreement that alldonor funding will respect the overall spending plansand limits of the government pooling donor funds in a single account and untying aid to procurement only from the country of origin ofthe funding limiting the number of country coordination bodies that can bring together national and internationalactors involved in health establishing a common framework for reporting and assessing progress, with a strong focus on countriesconducting the monitoring and evaluation, learningfrom it, and using the information to make their pro-grams more effective Some of the experiments in country-level coordination of development assistance to health reveal the difculties inimplementing the principles of better donor harmoniza-tion. In some instances, it has been hard to persuade donorsto pool their funds and break the tie between funding andprocurement. Monitoring and evaluation systems havesometimes not been strong enough to yield timely andmeaningful data on progress, a critically important feature ifdisbursements are linked to performance. Multiple nationalcoordination bodies for government,donors,and NGOs fordifferent diseases and services also persist in many settings. Global partnerships add value but involve risks Chapter 1 provided a long list of diverse global initiativesand partnerships (box 1.2). Each responds to priorities inpublic health in developing countries and to health prob-lems that represent global threats. Applying the Lessons of Development Assistance for Health | 159Are these efforts competing to garner attention on an already overwhelmed global development agenda? Arethey fragmenting the complex health challenges facingsocieties? Possibly both. But they reflect genuine collectiveattempts to solve large common problems, after long peri-ods of moribund, parallel, or conflicting efforts.The part-nerships speak different technical languages, have vastlydifferent resource bases, and target different risk groups.But they all seek to add value through a common array offunctions, including the following: National and global coordination. Committees, forums, communication channels, and Web sites make resourceor knowledge flows more efcient,identify where cross-national efforts are best merited, and reduce burdens onthose on the \"frontlines\"at the country or local levels. Strategy development and evaluation. Partnerships such as the Roll Back Malaria core strategies, the Global Plan toStop TB, and the current search for a common positionon antiretroviral drug resistance strive for consensus oneffective intervention packages, monitoring indicators,and replicable solutions to specic implementationobstacles or opportunities. Global nancing and delivery mechanisms and new tools. Partnerships such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Global TB Drug Facility;the Vaccine Fund; and the Global Alliance for ImprovedNutrition, as well as public-private partnerships fordeveloping new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines provideglobal public goods and respond to common externali-ties or market failures. Resource mobilization, social mobilization, and advocacy. Nearly all partnerships grapple with resource mobi-lization, advocacy, and community mobilization. Recent external evaluations of some of the major health partnerships, such as Stop TB and the Global Alliance forVaccines and Immunization, suggest that these collabora-tions are indeed adding substantial value. But some partner-ships lack strategic focus and try to do too much. Otherscommitted to stimulating a scaling-up of disease control andother interventions fail to engage enough with country-level processes to make things happen on the ground. The global partnerships can also have cumbersome and costly governance and management arrangements, withlarge governing boards that fail to make strategic decisionsor micromanage the full-time staff of the partnership sec-retariats. And some ignore, or exacerbate, the problemsafflicting the entire health system, such as the lack ofhuman resources for service delivery and weaknesses inintegrated monitoring and evaluation.The challenge is forcountries and donors to learn how to capitalize on theseglobal partnerships at the country level to throw light onhealth system issues and ultimately strengthen the under-lying human and physical infrastructure. So far there has been little cross-fertilization across the major health partnerships, although efforts are under way\u2014through the High-Level Forum for the MillenniumDevelopment Goals for health and through development ofa global partnership for child survival\u2014to bring togetherdifferent partners around a common goal or around all theMillennium Development Goals for health.It may be usefulfor countries active in multiple partnerships to initiate cross-partnership learning and collaboration.The small Initiativefor Public-Private Partnerships for Health, based in Geneva,is one example of a modest effort to share the lessons of theroughly 70 active programs involving industry and publicinstitutions in research and development and new productdevelopment to solve the health problems of developingcountries. Getting funds to the frontline Central government funds can easily leak as they movethrough the system to the periphery of the country. And inthe absence of local initiative and the right incentives, serviceprovision can fail to reflect the views of local people.Effectivedevelopment assistance to health needs to address theseimpediments. It needs to channel technologies, ideas, nance,and technical assistance closer to households and healthproviders and supervisory ofcials in ways consistent withnational policies and amenable to monitoring and reporting. Development assistance to health is likely to be more successful with four things in place: a decentralized system of duciary and technical man- agement in the public sector (nancial procedures,competent ofcials, open reporting) strong nancial capacity of NGOs and private providers a government body equipped and charged with regulating the quality of public and private providers a balanced approach to community-driven develop- ment in health, to ensure that social fund-type nanc-ing for community health initiatives is sustainable Examples of development assistance to health reaching frontline workers in an expeditious and sustainable wayinclude block grants for districts in Uganda, social funds inCentral America, contracting with urban and rural NGOs inthe Reproductive and Child Health Program in India, andsupport to community-led initiatives in the Multi-CountryAIDS Program (MAP). MAP is supporting thousands of 160|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthcommunity-led initiatives, including 2,500 subprojects in Ghana,1,200 community-based activities in Kenya,and sup-port to more than 4,600 villages in Ethiopia. Development assistance to health is still unpredictable Donor nancing for health has not been as reliable or sus-tained as is often claimed or hoped for, even under new\"long-term\" arrangements. In some countries the cuts indevelopment assistance to health have been sharp. Donorbudgets are subject to the usual business and politicalcycles\u2014and may go up or down yearly during budgetaryprocesses. For countries such as Comoros and Eritrea,where the year-to-year changes in external funding canamount to as much as a fth of all public spending forhealth, the fluctuations are so great that they make it nearlyimpossible to plan and implement a coherent national pro-gram (see gure 9.7). Further work is needed in designing mechanisms for development assistance to health that provide greaterassurance of sustained nancial support.The challenges areto overcome the factors that result in interruptions inlong-term development assistance to health, includingchanges in political leadership and aid agency manage-ment that lead to reneging on earlier agreements. Applying the lessons in World Bank programs What are governments and development agencies actually doing to align their efforts with the Millennium Develop-ment Goals? What new approaches are they taking toimprove their contributions? Are they applying the lessonsfrom experience with development assistance for health? Within the World Bank, a review of recent trends and changes in the Bank's principal instruments\u2014countryanalyses, policy dialogue with government, and nancingof country-based projects and programs\u2014suggests someimportant and encouraging developments in the way theinstitution is responding to the Millennium DevelopmentGoal challenge.While much more needs to be done in thecoming years,there are some positive signs.What follows isa brief description of activities in the following areas: conducting country analyses of Millennium Develop- ment Goal trends, prospects, and challenges to informPoverty Reduction Strategies incorporating the Millennium Development Goals in government policies and budgets, including medium-term expenditure frameworks strengthening the Millennium Development Goal focus in Bank assistance strategies integrating the Millennium Development Goals in Bank sectorwide and programmatic instruments reorienting lending and grants toward Millennium Development Goal outcome objectives using the Millennium Development Goals to build mon- itoring and evaluation capacity Conducting country analyses of Millennium Development Goal trends, prospects, and challenges The worldwide focus on the health, nutrition, and popula- tion goals has led to the production of several innovativeanalyses of Millennium Development Goal performance,trends, and determinants. In India the Bank recently com-pleted a multivariate analysis of the large disparities inMillennium Development Goal performance across statesand an assessment of the impact of public expenditures andother policies on Millennium Development Goal out-comes. 7The study concludes that the impact of additional public spending for improved child health and nutritionwould be greatest in the poorer Indian states. The studyrecommends steps to improve the efciency of publicexpenditures, by targeting certain services (such as immu-nization and community-based nutrition activities) andvillages and districts in the poorer states in which healthand nutrition indicators are the worst. A similar approachto geographical targeting has been proposed by the HungerTask Force under the Millennium Project, which has iden-tied 75 nutrition \"hot spots\" in Africa where more than40 percent of the continent's malnourished children live. In Egypt a recent Millennium Development Goal analysis found that targeting publicly nanced services andinvolving civil society in implementing programs andmonitoring progress for the health, nutrition, and popula-tion goals are critical for success. 7In Burkina Faso an in- depth review of the child mortality target identied keyconstraints at the household, health system, and policy lev-els. 8The review also analyzed policy reforms already undertaken and recommended further actions. The Bank has collaborated with local analysts and poli- cymakers in several African countries over the past twoyears to conduct studies on health, nutrition, and popula-tion trends and services nationally and as they relate to dif-ferent socioeconomic groups, with a special emphasis onthe poorest households.The studies, known as country sta-tus reports, have been completed for nine countries\u2014Burkina Faso, Chad, The Gambia, Guinea, Malawi,Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, and Tanzania\u2014and areongoing for another seven (e.g., box 10.3). The reports,important inputs into the national dialogue on theMillennium Development Goals and development policy, Applying the Lessons of Development Assistance for Health | 161have, in some countries, helped in drafting poverty strat- egy papers, estimating the cost of policies and programs,and designing medium-term public spending proposals. Incorporating the Millennium Development Goals in government policies and budgets The main ndings of country status reports from African nations have been fed into country-led processes\u2014thePoverty Reduction Strategy Papers and the medium-termexpenditure frameworks\u2014changing key policies in thehealth sector and reallocating public spending toward health,nutrition, and population services likely to have an impact onthe Millennium Development Goals. In Mauritania theanalysis shaped the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper andresulted in salary incentives for health workers serving inremote areas and an increase in the health sector budget ofnearly 70 percent over two years (box 10.4). Mauritania used\"marginal budgeting of bottlenecks\" tool to link theMillennium Development Goals for health outcomes withessential services and the marginal cost of providing these ser-vices on a sustainable basis.The tool enabled the Mauritanians 162|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthThe country status report for Guinea shows that the outlook for reaching the Millennium Development Goals is bleak. In 1999children born in the poorest 20 percent of the population weretwice as likely to die before reaching their rst birthday as chil-dren born in the richest 20 percent. Service use is particularlylow for children, as evidenced by low rates of vaccination andtreatment for acute respiratory infections. Despite high use ratesfor antenatal care, the rates of assisted deliveries are extremelylow in rural areas. Cost is a major barrier to use, particularly forpoor households. About 10-15 percent of households are per-manently unable to pay for health services, and few exemptionschemes and subsidization mechanisms are in place.As a result,many poor households frequently resort to self-medication. The key health sector performance issues included the following: Mismatch between where money is spent and epidemiological needs. Public expenditure in the 1990s focused on services in urban areas, particularly in the capital city of Conakry. Low availability of resources. More than 60 percent of health personnel work in Conakry, serving only 20 percent ofthe country's population. Drugs and vaccines are notreadily and consistently available. Spending on operationsand maintenance at the primary level is too low. Low perceived quality of services. Shortages of vaccines and drugs continue to undermine service quality, both techni-cal and perceived. The perceived quality of services isoften low. For example, many households do not viewassisted delivery services as being of good quality. The report recommends providing a package of essential interventions to the poor, strengthening institutional capacityby developing a framework for decentralization, reallocatingresources to primary and essential secondary care, and increas-ing the government's commitment to sustainable nancing. Source: References 9 and 10.Mauritania's Poverty Reduction Strategy, launched in 2000, profoundly reexamined health sector strategies, assessing pastsuccesses and failures and reorienting resources toward poorregions, poor groups, and efforts on outcomes related to theMillennium Development Goals. T o address demand- andsupply-side constraints, the strategy focused on reorientingpublic spending along three main lines: addressing gaps in ser-vice delivery to the poor, developing income protection mech-anisms, and strengthening the voice of poor people andcommunities in service design and management.The strategyidentied performance parameters and key inputs, such asincentives for rural practice, training and recruitment, facilitysupport, subsidized essential supplies, vaccination costs, emer-gency AIDS plan, subsidized third-party payer hospital funds,and monitoring of priority programs. The reform issuesaddressed include human resources, drug purchasing, logistics,autonomy of management committees, reform of budget pro-cedures, and performance contracts with regional directoratesbased on coverage objectives. The Ministry of Health developed a medium-term expendi- ture framework that showed explicitly how it would strengthenthree approaches to service delivery: family-oriented services,population-based services, and clinical care to \"purchase results\"in child and maternal mortality and malnutrition with invest-ments in health services.The Minister of Health led the budgetpreparation process, consulting at each step with the Minister ofFinance. Budgeting was done on the basis of the service deliverybottlenecks identied during the assessment phase. Results of the budget reform process have been impressive. The health sector budget increased by more than 50 percent in2002 and by 13 percent in 2003. An early evaluation of theimpact of the changes in the budgeting process shows anincrease in immunization coverage from 32 percent in 2001 to82 percent in 2002.The clear links in the national health bud-get between the new activities to be funded and the objectivesof the Poverty Reduction Strategy proved essential in the sub-sequent discussions with the Ministry of Finance and theInternational Monetary Fund.

Using the Millennium Development Goals to assess World Bank country assistance strategies T o better align its country assistance strategies to the Millennium Development Goals, the Bank has conductedinformal assessments in several regions. One example is theportfolio ranking in Benin, which found that the Bank'sactivities were weakly related to the goals: they had onlylow-to-moderate relevance for maternal and child mortalityreduction and mixed relevance for communicable diseases.The ranking concluded that the Bank needed to do more,through the Benin poverty reduction credit and other pro-jects, to have a substantial impact on health outcomes.TheBenin social fund was seen as a promising instrument forincreasing the Bank's impact. The country assessment alsohighlighted the importance of tracking intermediate indica-tors to measure progress in the short and medium terms. 12 In the Europe and Central Asia region of the Bank, staff drafted a Millennium Development Goal \"business plan,\"including a country-by-country analysis showing thatofcial data on child mortality and malnutrition were ofquestionable accuracy\u2014and that many countries in theregion were unlikely to meet the goals for 2015.The busi-ness plan called for special efforts to strengthen capacityfor monitoring and evaluation, align Bank projects betterto support achievement of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals, and expand multisectoral linkages. Integrating the Millennium Development Goals in the Bank's sectorwide and programmatic instruments In many cases the goals provide the strategic underpinnings of sectorwide programs in health and multisectoral budgetsupport. The Dominican Republic health project usesMillennium Development Goal intermediate and outcomeindicators to monitor progress. The health information sys-tem has been designed to capture data on these indicators,augmented by the results of periodic household surveys. InBolivia performance indicators for the Bank-nanced healthproject include coverage and quality of key child and mater-nal health and disease control services, as well as changes inthe incidence of diseases and deaths. Monitoring at themunicipal and national levels, with the involvement of civilsociety, will increase local participation and make local politi-cians and healthcare providers more accountable for results. Some sectorwide operations for health in Africa embody a sharp focus on the goals. Since sectorwide approachescombine donor resources in a single budget envelope andapply common procedures to their disbursement, they pro-vide a good vehicle for reducing transactions costs andbringing the government and external partners togetheraround a common set of outcome targets\u2014tied to thegoals. The Ghana sectorwide approach, now entering itssecond ve-year phase, has led to a substantial upswing inthe use of health services for better child and maternalhealth, with the largest increases in the poorest areas of thecountry. Success factors include joint appraisal by all part-ners, strong government leadership, and expanded capacityto manage donor funds. Some challenges to enhance theimpact of the Ghana sectorwide approach on the healthgoals will be to address persistent inequalities across regionsand households, the brain drain of Ghanaian health person-nel, and the limited use of NGOs to increase coverage. Reorienting and increasing Bank loans and grants to achieve Millennium Development Goal outcomes T o underpin national efforts to improve health outcomes, the World Bank has signicantly expanded its nancial com-mitments in health over the past four years, through projectsfocused on specic diseases (the tuberculosis and AIDS loanin the Russian Federation) and population groups (the BrazilFamily Health Project) as well as through broader healthsectorwide approaches and other multisectoral operations.This increase has been consistent with the stated goal ofboosting health lending from $1 billion in scal 2001 to $2.2billion in scal 2005.Mirroring this target,actual lending hasgrown from yearly commitments of $0.95 billion in scal2000 to $1.7 billion in scal 2003. Projected lending for s-cal 2004 is expected to be more than $2 billion. And thelending target for scal 2005 is likely to be met. An important feature of health lending is that more of it is being incorporated in health components in other sec-tors, such as transport, social protection, and water supplyand sanitation. For example, of the $1.7 billion in scal2003 commitments, about 44 percent of total health lend-ing was in projects and programs outside the health sector. These changes in the World Bank's response to the Millennium Development Goal agenda create three prob-lems. First, the Bank's organizational structure and incen-tives make it difcult to bring health specialists into projectteams led by staff from other disciplines, such as water sup-ply and transport. Unless this problem is solved, inadequateattention may be devoted to the health dimensions of thesemultisectoral operations.T o address the problem, the Bankhas organized special training and coaching arrangementsfor multisectoral teams, and it is testing budgeting and per-formance assessment techniques to encourage more effec-tive teamwork in a multisectoral environment. Second, the new projects require effective monitoring and evaluation systems to track progress on intermediateindicators and Millennium Development Goal outcomes.Traditionally, too little effort has gone to establishing such Applying the Lessons of Development Assistance for Health | 163monitoring systems at the outset of Bank-supported pro- grams.And most governments continue to be reluctant toinvest in the kind of operations research needed to evalu-ate the impact of these programs. Recent efforts to stan-dardize the use of intermediate indicators for theMillennium Development Goals for health\u2014as well asinitiatives to build strong monitoring into AIDS programsin Africa, tuberculosis control projects in China and else-where, and child health programs in Africa and LatinAmerica\u2014are pointing in the direction of a solution tothis problem. Third, the Bank needs to address the in-house mix of skills needed to manage relations with countries in an envi-ronment in which the focus is on the Millennium Develop-ment Goals and on a new set of nancial instruments.Required are staff with knowledge and experience of healthpolicy, institutional reform, and the economic, nancial, andregulatory dimensions of health. Existing staff will need tobe retrained and additional staff with the right skill setsrecruited. Over the past two years the Bank has begun totackle this challenge by expanding its external recruitmentand introducing new training programs on scaling up pro-grams related to the Millennium Development Goals andon using new lending and nancing instruments. Using the Millennium Development Goals to build monitoring and evaluation capacity Effective national programs to pursue the health, nutrition, and population Millennium Development Goals dependon the use of intermediate indicators to track progress\u2014and on building national monitoring and evaluation sys-tems with local capacity.The Bank is supporting efforts inboth areas. It convened a meeting of technical experts inNovember 2001 to review and agree on a framework ofintermediate determinants.Those determinants were laterpublished in a booklet now used in setting MillenniumDevelopment Goal targets in Poverty Reduction StrategyPapers and other national strategies and in developingmonitoring and evaluation systems. 13 Strengthening monitoring and evaluation capacity is taking different forms. In Albania, as part of a recent Bank-nanced poverty reduction credit, a monitoring and eval-uation template was prepared to help four ministries(including health) develop their own monitoring andevaluation systems, and a specialized advisory body onmonitoring was established. In Mali a health card has beendeveloped to give government ofcials and the public asnapshot of policy actions, health service indicators, andhealth outcomes for the entire country and for differentincome groups. One of the most important global and national efforts to improve monitoring and evaluation of progress towardthe Millennium Development Goals is for HIV/AIDS,where the Bank has been asked to take the lead role incoordinating partners (box 10.5) Toward coordinated donor actions to accelerate country level progress T o pull together the lessons of effective development assis- tance for the health goals, the donor community, in con-cert with leaders from developing countries, has begun to 164|The Millennium Development Goals for HealthThe success of the Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) and other investments in HIV/AIDS will be determined by thedegree to which implementing partners, countries, and thedonor community can learn by doing. This requires betterinformation on program reach and effectiveness.Y et few coun-tries have adequate capacity to collect and use basic coveragedata. Managerial and budgeting structures in most countrieslack performance incentives, and motivation is undermined bylack of feedback on whether programs are succeeding or failing. Recognizing this,and fueled by the intense demand for results at all levels, UNAIDS decided to form the Global HIV/AIDSMonitoring and Evaluation Support T eam (GAMET) at theWorld Bank. GAMET made considerable progress in its rst year of oper- ation.A GAMET advisory board was established to structure andprovide guidance across agencies. A country support team\u2014anetwork of consultant experts (the majority from Africa) inmonitoring and evaluation capacity building\u2014made more than70 visits to more than 20 countries active in the MAP . GAMETalso supported the design and implementation of a new manage-ment development intervention, the Rapid Results Initiative inEritrea. The initiative focuses on achieving highly visible andrapid results in AIDS prevention and treatment\u2014and puts inplace an accountability framework. Each of the agencies participating in the GAMET initiative faces tensions between its internal requirements for monitor-ing and evaluation and its desire to facilitate a coordinatedapproach at the country level. Donors are committed to reduc-ing the burden of multiple monitoring and evaluation requestsand policies, but each is also under pressure to show impact inthe near term, which can undercut even the best intentions torely on country-based systems. Spending staff time coordinat-ing approaches and building country capacity rather than ful-lling duciary responsibilities to monitor their own programsgenerates additional problems. Despite the obstacles, GAMETshows promise, especially as governments and agencies see thebenets of a common approach to monitoring and evaluatingnational HIV/AIDS programs.

The Framework for Action to Accelerate Progress on the Health, Nutrition, and Population Millennium Goals, endorsed at the high-level policy meeting in May 2003 in Ottawa,Canada, holds promise for all stakeholders.The focus is onbuilding stronger national health systems as a platform fordelivering essential services to the poor. The frameworklays out commonly held principles and describes a processfor countries and donors to work together in expandingand improving the effectiveness of their investments inhealth systems (box 10.6). It requires country actions, suchas incorporating analysis of Millennium DevelopmentGoal challenges and policy and funding gaps in povertystrategy papers, and simpler arrangements for donor coor-dination. It also calls for stronger global efforts to invest inkey public goods with multicountry benets, such asresearch and development for new drugs and vaccines forAIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. And it promotes docu-menting and sharing successful cases of national efforts toachieve the malnutrition and maternal and child healthgoals. At the rst High-Level Forum on health MDGs, cohosted by the World Health Organization and the WorldBank in Geneva, January 8-9, 2004, heads of developmentagencies, bilateral agencies, global health initiatives, andministers of nance and health met to informally discussconcrete actions to accelerate and monitor progresstoward the Millennium Development Goals for health andnutrition. The forum focused on major constraints toprogress in three areas: nancial resources and aid effec-tiveness, human resources, and monitoring performance. Ithighlighted the policy steps that developing countriesneed to implement to save lives\u2014and the harmonizedactions that donors must take to increase the impact ofnancial and technical support to developing countries.The key conclusions and actions agreed on at the High-Level Forum are presented in box 10.7. Applying the Lessons of Development Assistance for Health | 165What donors should do Create donor buy-in and coherence by subscribing to a country- based Millennium Development Goals for health strategy, includ-ing goals and targets, policy actions, nancing proposals, andmonitoring arrangements, within a framework guided by thePoverty Reduction Strategy Paper and associated sectoralstrategies. Build on existing mechanisms at the country level, including Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and sectorwide approaches,bilateral and multilateral funding streams, and those emanatingfrom the global health initiatives. Harmonize efforts to overcome funding gaps, fungibility issues, rigidity in nancing recurrent expenditures, and lack ofpredictability of aid flows. Commit to providing additional long-term nancial assistance disbursed through existing multilateral and bilateral channelsand instruments. No new funding body is envisaged. Donors would move toward long-term assistance in a reliable and timelymanner, including support for recurrent expenditures. Increase efforts to work with NGOs and communities.Reduce the transactions costs of development assistance to health, by seeking to harmonize reporting requirements,procurement rules, and nancial management systems. Support capacity building for results-oriented monitoring and evaluation. Donors would also commit to an independent review of their actions and to sharing the lessons of this review withother stakeholders.What countries should do Develop a credible strategy. Prepare as part of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process a credible strategy and imple-mentation plan (or review gaps and opportunities in existingstrategies and plans) for achieving faster progress toward theMillennium Development Goals for health, based on a solidanalysis of impediments to faster progress and a thoroughassessment of policy options. Tackle key constraints, including the need for better human resources, safe and predictable supply of drugs, stronger man-agement systems, and more effective public-private interactions. Adopt a strong multisectoral framework within and beyond the health sector. This framework would be explicit about policychanges beyond health, such as overall public administrationreform, and about other multisectoral activities. Make a commitment to improve governance and policies, including policies on decentralization, civil society participationand monitoring, public-private partnerships, and public expendi-ture allocation decisions. Strengthen transparency, monitoring and evaluation, through commitment to open and transparent reporting. Provide voice to citizens\u2014especially poor people, in formulating and implementing strategy. Consultations would be undertakenas part of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process andbeyond and include NGOs and communities. Source: Reference 14.

Applying the Lessons of Development Assistance for Health | 167169Rates of change Unless stated otherwise, rates of change are computed on the assumption that the indicator in question falls by thesame proportion each year. Rates are computed using dis-crete growth formulae. If m 1990and m2015are the rates of malnutrition in 1990 and 2015, the Millennium Develop-ment Target requires that ( m 2015- m1990)/m1990= 0.5, -0.27. Malnutrition Data on malnutrition (underweight among children) come from the World Health Organization's malnutritiondatabase, available at www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/ .The data comprise very incomplete series for the 1990s for alarge number of developing countries. Many countries donot have data for adjacent years. For each country, aregression was estimated for this report for the 1990s, link-ing the natural logarithm of underweight to the year ofthe survey, the coefcient being interpretable as the aver-age annual rate of reduction (or increase) over the periodfor which data are available. The coefcients were thenaveraged\u2014using population sizes as weights\u2014to obtainregional averages. This method is less restrictive than themethod used in an earlier study, 1where regressions were in effect estimated at the regional level. Although coun-tries were allowed to have different intercepts, they wereassumed to have the same slopes as other countries in theregion (that is, common rates of change).Under-ve mortality Data come from the United Nations Children's Fundchild mortality database, available at www.childinfo.org . The data comprise mostly complete series for 1960, 1970,1980, 1990, 1995, and 2000.Average growth rates for, say,the 1990s were calculated assuming constant proportion-ate growth using the formula r= (m 2000/m1990)1/10-1. Maternal mortality See Box 2.1 and appendix B. Communicable disease mortality See appendix B. Modeling prospects for future progress on the health Millennium Development Goals The modeling strategy is to ask how future changes will affect the growth rate of the Millennium DevelopmentIndicator in question. Mortality or malnutrition, m,i s assumed to be related to a vector of determinants, x, in the following way: ln m= cients, bis interpretable as an elasticity, and eis an error term. Differentiating this expression with respect to timeyields a growth equation of the form: m= bx+ eAPPENDIX A Data and Methodswhere mis the rate of growth of mand so on.The change in the growth rate can be written: m= b x+ e so that if the growth rates of each of the elements of x remain the same over time, mwill continue to fall at the same rate. If, by contrast, there is a change in the growthrate of, say, x 1(which might be per capita income) but all the other x's (x2,..., xK) continue to grow at the same rate, the change in the rate of growth of mis given by: m= b1x1. Given an estimate of the elasticity b1and an estimate of change in the growth rate of x1, one can estimate the size of the change in the growth rate of mlikely to result from a change in the growth rate of x1.The same method can be used to assess the effects of changes in growth rates ofseveral x's simultaneously. Regression models for the growth simulations Elasticities for the various country-level determinants of each of the Millennium Development Indicators areneeded to operationalize this growth simulation approach.For this report, the study by Filmer and Pritchett 2of country-level influences on child mortality was extendedand replicated on more recent data and on otherMillennium Development Indicators. Regressions were estimated linking the Millennium Development Indicators to government health spending as apercent of GDP , income per capita, and variables capturingfemale education, access to drinking water, income inequal-ity, ethnolinguistic fractionalization, and regional dummies.Regressions were also run including a measure of infrastruc-ture in addition to these determinants. Regressions were runfor under-ve mortality (2000), maternal mortality (1995),underweight (2000), and tuberculosis mortality (2000) as thedependent variable.All variables were entered in logarithmicform to facilitate the growth accounting outlined above.Asin Filmer and Pritchett's study, countries with missing valuesfor variables other than health spending and income wereretained in the sample by including in the regression a miss-ing value dummy variable flag and setting the variable withthe missing value equal to zero for the country in question.Table A.1 provides the variable denitions and the sources ofthe data. As in Filmer and Pritchett's study, government health spending is treated as endogenous to eliminate any reversecausality\u2014governments may choose their spending levels inthe light of their mortality rates.As in Filmer and Pritchett'sstudy, the instruments used were the average levels ofdefense and health spending by the country's neighbors (asidentied by Filmer and Pritchett). Also included in theinstrument set was the average value of an index of \"voice\"among neighbors. In contrast to Filmer and Pritchett, butlike Swaroop, 1this study allows for the possi- bility that the elasticity of government health spending maydepend on the quality of governance, the hypothesis beingthat health spending will have a larger impact on healthoutcomes in better-governed countries. Governance ismeasured using the Bank's Country Policy and InstitutionalAssessment (CPIA) index, which is increasing in quality ofgovernance and takes a minimum of 1 and a maximum of6. Part I countries (the industrial countries), for which noCPIA score is available, were assigned a CPIA score of 5.The government spending variable is interacted with theCPIA score, and elasticities and t-statistics are computed for different values of the CPIA index.The interaction is alsotreated as endogenous, with the three original instrumentsinteracted with the CPIA score serving as instruments forthe spending-CPIA interaction. 3 Per capita income is converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars (as in Filmer and Pritchett) and of-cial exchange rates. Using PPP dollars may be moreappropriate, but since PPP dollars are not specic to thehealth sector (or more accurately to the goods and servicesthat make for lower mortality and malnutrition), it is notobvious that the overall PPP is necessarily always a moreappropriate converter than the exchange rate. The broadconclusions are unaffected, but some of the magnitudesinvolved are sensitive to the choice. Female education is captured through variables that indicate the percentage of women 15 and over who havecompleted primary education, the percentage of women15 and over who have completed secondary education,and the percentage of women 15 and over who have com-pleted higher-level schooling. The \"missing\" category iswomen who have not completed any level of education.Including female education in this way allows investiga-tion of the returns\u2014in terms of better health outcomes\u2014of increasing primary completion rates and of narrowinggender differentials in education enrolment, both of whichare Millennium Development Goals in their own right. Italso allows for the possibility that primary and secondaryeducation have different effects on health outcomes.Thewater variable proved to be highly collinear with a sanita-tion variable originally included, so only the water vari-able was retained. In addition, as in Filmer and Pritchett,income inequality (measured through the Gini coef-cient) and an index of ethnolinguistic fractionalizationwere included. The nal variable\u2014not included in theFilmer and Pritchett specication\u2014is the length of thecountry's paved road network in kilometers (the number 170|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthof kilometers of roads times the fraction of roads that are paved), expressed as a proportion of the country's area (insquare kilometers).This variable captures infrastructure. Table A.2 shows the results of the regressions. Equation 3 in each case is closest to the Filmer and Pritchettspecication\u2014per capita income is converted using PPPs,and the infrastructure variable is excluded. All equationsdiffer from the Filmer and Pritchett specication in thatthe spending-CPIA interaction is included. In virtually allspecications, the interaction is negative, suggesting thatbetter-governed countries have larger (in absolute size)elasticities of mortality and malnutrition with respect togovernment health spending.This result is consistent withthe ndings of Rajkumar and Swaroop. For a given valueof the CPIA index, the spending elasticities are smallest forunder-ve mortality and become statistically signicantfor under-ve mortality only at very high CPIA scores.The low elasticity of under-ve mortality with respect togovernment health spending is consistent with Filmer andPritchett, though somewhat at odds with Rajkumar and Applying the Lessons of Development Assistance for Health | 171Variable Denition Source Log government health expendi- Government health expenditures as proportion of GDP Reference 7 tures as a percentage of GDP Log government health expenditures as a The CPIA (Country Policy and Institutional Assessment) assesses the World Bank percentage of GDP interacted with CPIA quality of a country's policy and institutional framework.

(Theirindex of governance was, however, different.) The health spending elasticities for the Millennium Development Indicators other than under-ve mortality arenot only larger absolutely than those for under-ve mortal-ity, they also become statistically signicant at lower CPIAscores. The results suggest that\u2014whatever the MillenniumDevelopment Indicator\u2014simply adding additional dollars tothe budget of a ministry of health in a country with a CPIAindex of less than 3 will not yield improvements in anyMillennium Development Indicator. By contrast, in coun-tries with CPIA scores of 3.25 and higher, additional dollarsin the ministry of health budget could reduce rates of mater-nal mortality (see equation 1 in table A.2).The cut-off formalnutrition is somewhat higher\u2014a CPIA of 3.5 or so(compare with equation 2), which given the insignicanceof the road variable might be argued to be preferable toequation 1. In the case of tuberculosis mortality, the CPIAcut-off is about 4.25 (see equation 1).These elasticities indi-cate the effects at the margin of adding dollars to the min-istry of health budget on the assumption that the additionaldollars are allocated across programs and institutions in pro-portion to current allocations.Adding dollars specically to agovernment tuberculosis program might yield a signicantpayoff in terms of reduced tuberculosis mortality at muchlower CPIA levels than 4.25.The results cannot,however,tellus whether or not this is the case. Under-ve mortality appears to be more responsive to per capita income than the other Millennium Develop-ment Indicators, with the possible exception of tuberculo-sis mortality. Female education has a signicantly negativeeffect only on maternal mortality\u2014and even then only atthe secondary level.The lack of any effect on under-vemortality is at odds with the Filmer and Pritchett results,which report a signicant effect of years of education.Access to drinking water has a signicant negative effecton maternal mortality in all specications and on under-ve mortality in the specications in which exchange ratesare used to convert per capita incomes. Income inequalityhas mostly an insignicant effect, though there is somesuggestion it makes a difference to under-ve mortality.The same is true of the index of ethnolinguistic fractional-ization.The road infrastructure variable, by contrast, has asignicant negative effect on under-ve mortality, mater-nal mortality, and tuberculosis mortality. Forecasting trends in economic growth and the nonhealth goals Economic growth forecasts are taken from the Bank's Global Economic Prospects .4For secondary school completion the extra growth required to achieve gender parity in the proportion of thepopulation 15 and over that has completed secondaryeducation is computed. In the absence of this extragrowth, completion rates are assumed to grow linearlybetween 2000 and 2015, following the same trend asbetween 1995 and 2000. This yields the 2015 value formales that females will also need to reach to achieve thegender Millennium Development Goal. The forecastassumes that achievement of the goal occurs throughaccelerated linear growth for females from the female2000 value to the male 2015 value.This gives the growthrate needed between 2000 and 2015 to achieve the gendergoal.This rate is compared with the current growth rate toobtain the extra growth in secondary completion requiredto achieve the gender goal. For access to drinking water, the extra growth required to halve the proportion of the population without accessbetween 1990 and 2015 is computed. In the absence ofthis extra growth, the access rate is assumed to rise (or fall)between 2000 and 2015 linearly at the same rate as in the1990s. The growth that would need to occur to achievethe goal is found by assuming access grows linearlybetween 2000 and 2015, starting from the 2000 value andending in 2015 at the value implied by the MillenniumDevelopment Goal. The extra growth is the differencebetween the projected growth based on current trends andthe growth required to achieve the goal. References 1. Rajkumar,A., and V .

World Development Indicators. Washington, DC:Washington, DC. 174|The Millennium Development Goals for Health175Assessments of progress toward the Millennium Develop- ment Goals are subject to uncertainties because of differ-ences in how the indicators are dened,which measurementinstruments are used, how frequently the information is col-lected, and how much effort has been invested in the devel-opment of measurement systems. Child malnutrition The prevalence of underweight children is dened as theproportion of children under ve whose weight for theirage is less than two standard deviations below the medianfor an international reference population. Data collectionis most often done with household surveys, which requirethat the interviewers measure children and obtain theirage in months. Inaccuracies in this information, as well asother errors due to sampling errors, are the main reasonsfor the uncertainties about the estimated prevalence ofmalnutrition. Condence intervals at the 95 percent levelin the Demographic and Health Survey sample are typi-cally about plus or minus two percentage points, but theinterval varies depending on the size of the sample and theprevalence of underweight children. Household surveys that measure malnutrition indicators are usually conducted several years apart, and several coun-tries do not have baselines for the earlier years of theMillennium Development Goal period. In some coun-tries, surveys are not nationally representative and mayproduce estimates that are not comparable with earlier orlater estimates. Some countries have used different refer-ence populations, which are not usable at all. As with all indicators, measuring changes over time implies using at least two estimates that are subject tounknown biases, which makes establishing signicantchanges more difcult.The WHO has assembled a databaseof such data, available at www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/ . For this report, a regression was estimated for each countryfor the 1990s, linking the natural logarithm of underweightchildren to the year of the survey. The coefcient can beinterpreted as the average annual rate of decrease\u2014orincrease\u2014over the period for which data are available.Thecoefcients were then averaged\u2014using population sizes asweights\u2014to obtain regional averages.This is less restrictivethan the method used in an earlier study, 1in which regres- sions were in effect estimated at the regional level.Although countries were allowed to have different inter-cepts, it was assumed they had the same slopes as othercountries in the region (that is, the same rates of change). Child mortality\u2014infant and under-ve mortality Infant and child mortality are measured using vital regis- tration systems and household surveys. Vital registrationsystems can provide detailed and precise annual statisticswhen all or nearly all births and deaths of children underve are registered. But many countries have vital registra-tion systems that do not capture all births or deaths, mak-ing such systems of little use for estimating mortalityindicators. When compared with other sources of infor-mation, estimates based on vital registration systems arefrequently found to be too low. Household surveys measure infant and child mortality by asking female respondents to report the number of chil-dren they have given birth to and the survival status of thechildren.Some surveys collect detailed information to con-struct full birth histories for each respondent, while otherscollect only enough information to estimate childhoodAPPENDIX B Why Tracking Progress Toward the Health Goals Isn't Easymortality indicators with additional demographic models. Where both types of data are available, they frequently pro-duce different estimates and trends in mortality.As with allhousehold surveys, sampling and other errors produceuncertainty about the exact level of the indicators.Condence intervals at the 95 percent level for under-vemortality in Demographic and Health Surveys vary from aslow as plus or minus 5 per 1,000 (India 1998/99) to as highas plus or minus 11 per 1,000 (Ethiopia 2000).At any levelof disaggregation, condence intervals tend to be larger. Because of the retrospective reporting on childhood deaths, survey-based estimates generally are not estimatesfor the year of the survey but are commonly presented asaverages for the ve-year period before the survey.Annualestimates are rarely available, as these would require verylarge sample sizes. One advantage of collecting childhood mortality estimates with surveys is that one obtains estimates for as long as 15years in the past,allowing trends to be estimated from a singlesurvey. When multiple household surveys are available andestimates have been made from both birth histories anddemographic models,additional analytical efforts are requiredto produce a consistent series.The latest exercise (available atwww.childinfo.org) has produced data for 1960, 1970, 1980,1990, 1995, and 2000. 2,3The data for 1990 and 2000 were used to compute the average annual rate of decline (orincrease) using the formula r= (m 2000/m1990)1/10- 1, where m1990and m2000are the mortality rates for 1990 and 2000. Maternal health\u2014the maternal mortality ratio The maternal mortality ratio is one of the more problem- atic indicators to monitor. The indicator is a ratio of thenumber of deaths directly or indirectly related to preg-nancy and the number of live births in a given time period.Because not all pregnancies result in live births, the ratioalways overestimates the true risk of dying of maternalcauses.The use of births as the denominator makes it theo-retically possible for the measure to be greater than one. Maternal mortality ratios can be estimated with vital registration data, but the incompleteness of vital registra-tion systems is a major obstacle to their use in epidemiol-ogy. Where vital registration is complete, both thenumerator and denominator for the maternal mortalityratio can be obtained. But even in countries with relativelygood overall cause of death data, maternal causes are gen-erally not very accurate. Even in countries with completecoverage of deaths in vital registration, maternal deathsmay be misclassied in as many as 50 percent of cases. In other countries the cause of death is sometimes estab- lished through the \"verbal autopsy\" method, in which sur-viving household members or others (such as health careworkers) who were close to the deceased are interviewed toestablish cause of death. The questionnaire used in suchstudies includes questions about signs and symptoms of ill-nesses at the time of death, medical history, and obstetricalhistory.The verbal autopsy methodology often fails to iden-tify deaths early in pregnancy due to ectopic pregnancy orabortion or those occurring some time after delivery. Household surveys are the main instrument for measur- ing maternal mortality indicators. The usual approach isbased on the so-called sisterhood methods,in which femalerespondents are asked to report on the survival of sisters.These methods do not produce reliable results when fertil-ity is low (a total fertility rate of about 3 or lower) or wherefertility has changed a great deal in recent years.Dependingon which questions are asked, the estimates generally referto mortality that occurred several years before the survey(10-12 years in some cases). Sisterhood methods cannotreliably report on early pregnancy-related deaths, as preg-nancy status will be less likely to be known to the respon-dents. Induced abortion-related deaths are likely to beunderreported for the same reason. Even with large samplesizes, standard errors tend to be very large. For example, theMalawi Demographic and Health Survey in 1992 gener-ated a maternal mortality ratio of 752, with a 95 percentcondence interval of 523-803, for the six years before thesurvey. Because of such large condence intervals and thenumber of years before the survey to which the estimaterefers, household surveys are not suitable for monitoringshort-term trends in maternal mortality or assessing theimpact of programs. The cost and complexity of collecting data with these methods has led the WHO and UNICEF to develop modelsthat predict maternal mortality indicators. 3Such models use variables such as the proportion of births with a skilled atten-dant, fertility rates, variables indicating regions, andHIV/AIDS prevalence to model the maternal mortalityratio. These variables may not be good predictors of thematernal mortality indicators, and they may themselves bepoorly measured. For these reasons, maternal mortality ratiosestimated in this way have wide margins of uncertainty.Thismodeling approach was used to estimate changes in thematernal mortality ratios at the regional level in the 1990s. Incidence, prevalence, and death from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria Monitoring trends in communicable diseases requires sur- veillance for correct diagnosis of a disease through clinicaldiagnosis or laboratory conrmation. Surveillance of HIV/AIDS prevalence has focused on testing pregnant women in antenatal clinics. Such surveil- 176|The Millennium Development Goals for Healthlance is subject to various biases: the sites are more likely to be located in or near urban areas, pregnant women mayhave different risks of infection than the overall femalepopulation of reproductive age, and pregnant women arenot likely to be representative of the entire adult popula-tion.A new approach to establishing adult HIV prevalenceis being implemented as part of Demographic and HealthSurveys by serosurveys of household members. But highlevels of nonresponse may limit the usefulness of thisapproach. For malaria, incidence is particularly difcult to estab- lish, as the symptoms of malaria are similar to those ofmany other acute infectious diseases that affect children.Even when microscopy is available, the cause of fever inchildren will be difcult to determine, as malaria para-sitaemia are frequently present in children in endemicareas, making it difcult to determine which organism isresponsible for the fever. Measurement of malaria mortalityis equally difcult in the absence of cause-specic informa-tion recorded as part of vital registration systems.T oo fewchildren with severe malaria are admitted to hospitals torely on hospital records: an estimated 90 percent of childdeaths occur at home in Sub-Saharan countries. Given thedifculty of diagnosing malaria correctly in these circum-stances, the best approach is believed to be monitoring allcauses of under-ve mortality in malarious areas. References 1. de M., E.A.

However, despite the efforts of the 1990s, the prospect of achieving these goals looks bleak\u2014the extent of premature death and ill health in the developing world continues to be staggering. In 2001, 3 million people died from HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis claimed another 2 million lives. In 2000, almost 11 million children died before their fifth birthday, and anestimated 140 million children under age five were underweight. In 1995, over half a million women died during pregnancy or childbirth. This heavy burden of death and suffering is concentrated in the world's poorest countries and acts as a formidable obstacle to poverty reduction.
