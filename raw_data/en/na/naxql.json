Barnes National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial 2010 / Published: 18 March 2010 Abstract: Theophylline (3-methyxanthine) has been us ed to treat airway diseases for over 70 years. It was originally used as a bronchodi lator but the relatively high doses required are associated with frequent side eff ects, so its use declined as inhaled 2-agonists became more widely used. More recently it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in asthma and COPD at lower concentrations. The molecular mechanism of bronchodilatation is inhibition of phosphodieste rase(PDE)3 and PDE4, but be histone deacetylase (HDAC) activatio n, resulting in switchi ng off of activated inflammatory genes. Through this mechanism theophylline also revers es corticosteroid resistance and this may be of particular va lue in severe asthma and COPD where HDAC2 activity is markedly reduced. Theophylline is gi ven systemically (orally as slow-release preparations for chronic treatment and intrav enously for acute exacerbations of asthma) and blood concentrations are determined ma inly by hepatic metabolism, which may be increased or decreased in several diseases and by concomitant drug therapy. Theophylline is now usually used as an add-on therapy in asthma patients not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids and in COPD patients with severe disease not c ontrolled by bronchodilator therapy. Side effects are related to plasma concentrations and incl ude nausea, vomiting and headaches due to PDE inhibition and at higher concentrations to cardiac arrhythmias and seizures due to adenosine 2010 , 3 726 1. Introduction Theophylline remains one of the most widely pres cribed drugs for the treatment of asthma and COPD world-wide, since it is in expensive and widely available. In many industrialized countries, however, theophylline has become a third-line treatme nt that is only used in poorly controlled patients as an add-on therapy. This has been reinforced by various national and inte rnational guidelines on asthma and COPD therapy. Some have even ques tioned whether theophylline is indicated in any patients with asthma [1], although others have emphasized the special beneficial effects of theophylline which still give it an important place in management of asthma [2]. The frequency of side-effects at the previously recommended doses and the relatively low efficacy of theophylline have recently led to reduced usage, since inhaled 2-agonists are far more effective as bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids have a greater anti-inflamm atory effect. Despite the fact that theophylline has been used in asthma therapy for over 70 years, th ere is still considerable uncertainty about its molecular mode of action in asthma and its logical place in therapy. Recently novel mechanisms of action that may account for the effec tiveness of theophylline in severe asthma have been elucidated [3]. Because of problems with side effects, ther e have been attempts to improve on theophylline and recently there has been increasing interest in sele ctive phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, which have the possibility of improving the beneficial and reducing the adverse effects of theophylline. 2. Chemistry Theophylline is a methylxanthine, similar in struct ure to the common dietary xanthines caffeine and theobromine. Several substituted derivatives have been synthesized, but none has any advantage over theophylline [2]. The 3-propyl derivative, enprofyllin e, is more potent as a bronchodilator and may have fewer toxic effects; however , its clinical development was ha lted because of hepatic toxicity problems [4]. Many salts of theophylline have also been marketed, the most common being aminophylline, the ethylene diamine salt used to increase solubility at neutral pH, so that intravenous administration is possible. Other salts, such as choline theophyllinate, do not have any advantage and others, such as acepifylline, are virtually inactive. Doxofyllin e (7-(1,3-dioxalan-2-yl-methyl) theophylline) has similar efficacy to theophylline but has less effect on adenos ine receptors so fewer cardiovascular and central side effects [5]. It is well tolerated when gi ven twice daily by mouth. 3. Molecular Mechanisms of Action Although theophylline has been in cl inical use for more than 70 year s, its mechanism of action at a molecular level and its site of action remain un certain, although there have been important recent advances. Several molecular mechanisms of acti on have been proposed, ma ny of which appear to occur only at higher concentratio ns of theophylline than are e ffective clinically (Table 1). Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 727 Table 1. Proposed mechanisms of action of theophylline. Phosphodiesterase inhibition (non-selective) Adenosine receptor antagonism nuclear ( efficacy a PD Es, which break down cyclic nucleotides in the cell, thereby leading to an incr (Figure 1). However, the degree of inhibition is small at concentratio ns of theophylline that are therapeu tically relevant. Thus total PDE activity in human lung extracts is inhibited by only 5-10% by th erapeutic concentrations of theophylline [6]. There is convincing in vitro evidence that theophylline re laxes airway smooth muscle by inhibition of PDE activity, but relatively high c oncentrations are needed for maximal relaxation [7]. Similarly, the inhibitory effect of theophylline on me diator release from alveolar macrophages appears to be mediated by inhibition of PD E activity in these cells [8]. There is no evidence that airway smooth muscle or inflammatory cells concentrate theophyllin e to achieve higher intracellular than circulating concentrations. Inhibition of PDE should lead to synergistic interaction with -agonists, but this has not been convincingly demonstrated in vivo or in clinical studies; howe ver, this might be because relaxation of airway smooth muscle by -agonists may involve direct coupling of -receptors via a stimulatory G-protein to the opening of potassium channels, without th e involvement of cyclic AMP [9]. At least 11 isoenzyme families of PDE have now been recognized and some (PDE3, PDE4, PDE5) are important in smooth muscle relaxation [10]; however, there is no convincing evidence that theophylline has any greater inhibitory effect on the PDE isoenzymes involved in smooth muscle relaxation. It is possible that PDE isoenzymes may have an incr eased expression in asthmatic airways, either as a result of the chronic inflammatory process, or as a resu lt of therapy. Elevation of cyclic AMP by \u00df-agonists may result in increased PDE activit y, thus limiting the effect of \u00df-agonists. Indeed, alveolar macrophages from asthmatic patients appear to have increased PDE activity [11]. This would mean that theophylline might have a greater inhibitory e ffect on PDE in asthmatic airways than in normal airways. Support for this is provided by the lack of bronchodilator effect of theophylline in normal subjects, compared to a bronchodila tor effect in asthmatic patients [12]. Inhibition of PDEs is likely to account for some of the most frequent side effects of theophylline, including nausea and vomiting (PDE4), palpitations and cardiac arrhythmias (PDE3) and headaches (PDE4). Pharmaceuticals , 3 728 Figure 1. Effect of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors in the breakdown of cyclic nucleotides in airway smooth muscle and inflammatory cells. Key: R = receptor, Gs = a potent inhibitor of adenosine r eceptors at therapeutic concentrations. Both A 1- and A 2-receptors are inhibited, but theophyl line is less effective against A 3-receptors, suggesting that this could be the basis for its bronchodilator e ffects [13]. Although adenos ine has little effect on normal human airway smooth muscle in vitro , it constricts airways of asthmatic patients via the release of histamine and leukotrienes, sugges ting that adenosine releases medi ators from mast cells [14]. The receptor involved appears to be an A 3- receptor in rat mast cells [15,16], but in humans A 2B-receptors are involved [17]. Adenos ine causes bronchoconstric tion in asthmatic subjects when given by inhalation [18]. The mechanism of bronchoconstriction is indirect an d involves release of histamine from airway mast cells [14,19]. Th e bronchoconstrictor effect of ade nosine is prevented by therapeutic concentrations of theophylline [18]; however, this only confirms that theophylline is capable of antagonizing the effects of adenosine at therapeutic concentrations, and does not necessarily indicate that this is important for its anti -asthma effect. Adenosine antagonism is likely to account for some of the side effects of theophylline, such as central nervous system stimulation, cardiac arrhythmias (both via blockade of A 1-receptors), gastric hypersecretion, gastro esophageal reflux and diuresis. A novel AMP receptor, P2Y 15, has been identified which is more potently inhibited by theophylline [20], although the function of these receptors has been questioned. Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 729 3.3. Interleukin-10 Release Interleukin(IL)-10 has a br oad spectrum of anti-inflammatory eff ects and there is evidence that its secretion is reduced in asthma and COPD [21]. IL-10 release is increased by theophylline and this effect may be mediated via PDE inhibition [22], although this has not been seen at the low doses that are effective in asthma [23]. 3.4. Effects on Gene Transcription Theophylline prevents the translocation of the proi nflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor- B (NF-B) into the nucleus, thus potentially reduci ng the expression of inflammatory genes in asthma and COPD [24]. Inhibition of NF- B appears to be due to a pr otective effect against the degradation of the inhibitory protein I- B, so that nuclear translocation of activated NF- B is prevented [25]. However, these effects are seen at high concentrations and may be mediated by inhibition of PDE. 3.5. Effect on Kinases Theophylline directly 50 75 M) [26], a subtype of the enzyme that has been implicated in responses to oxidative stress [27]. However, it is a re latively weak effect against the PI3K- subtype (IC 50 800 M), which is involved in chemotactic re sponses of neutrophils and monocy tes. The inhibitory effect of theophylline on PI3K- may account for the ability of theophylline to reverse corticosteroid resistance, which may be of critical importa nce for its clinical effects in severe asthma and COPD [28]. 3.6. Effects on Apoptosis Prolonged survival of granulocytes due to a reducti on in apoptosis may be important in perpetuating chronic inflammation in COPD. Theophylline prom otes inhibits apoptosis in neutrophils in vitro [29]. This is associated with a reduction in the anti-apoptot ic protein Bcl-2 [30]. This effect is not mediated via PDE inhibition, but in neutrophils may be mediated by antagonism of adenosine A 2A-receptors [31]. Theophylline also induces ap optosis of T-lymphocytes, thus reducing their survival and this effect appears to be mediated via PDE inhibition [32]. Theophylline also inhibits is act ivated by oxidative stress and leads to a reduction in nicotine adenine diamine levels resulting in an energy crisis that leads to cell death [33]. 3.7. Histone Deacet ylase Activation A novel mechanism of action involving activati on of histone deacetylases (HDAC) has been described which, in contrast to the proposed molecular mechanisms discussed above, is seen at therapeutically relevant concentrations [3]. Expr ession of inflammatory genes is regulated by the balance between histone acetylation and deacetylation [34]. In asthma multiple inflammatory genes are activated through proinflammatory tran scription factors, such as NF- B, leading to histone acetylation and increased transcription. This process is reversed by the recr uitment of histone deacetylases (HDAC) to the activated inflammatory gene promoter site within the nucleus. Corticosteroids suppress Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 730 inflammation by recruiting HDAC2 to activated in flammatory genes, thus switching off their expression [35]. This molecular mechanism is de fective in COPD patients as HDAC2 activity and expression is markedly reduced, thus accounting for the steroid resistance of COPD [36]. There is also a defect in HDAC2 function in patients with seve re asthma and in asthmatic patients who smoke [37,38]. Theophylline is an activator of HDACs a nd enhances the anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids, as well as reversing steroid resist ance in cells from COPD patients [39,40] (Figure 2). Figure Theophylline e (HDACs) which the histone rase activity of co-activators, such as CREB-binding protei n (CBP). This results in suppression of inflammatory genes and proteins, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleuki n-8 (IL-8) that have been switched on by proinflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor- B (NF-B). Corticosteroids also activate HDACs, but through a different mechanism resu lting in the recruitment of HDACs to the activated transcriptional complex via activation of the glucocorti coid receptors (GR) which function as a molecular bridge. This predic ts that theophylline and corticosteroids may have a synergistic effect in repre ssing inflammatory gene expression. This action of theophylline is seen at low plas ma concentrations (optimally 5 mg/L) and is completely independent of PDE inhibition and ade nosine antagonism. The effect of theophylline is reversed by an HDAC inhibitor ca lled trichostatin A and by knoc king out HDAC2 using [41]. theophy is of PI3K-, which is activated by oxidative stress and involved in the regulation of HDAC2 activity [28]. This effect of theophylline is seen particularly in the presence of oxidative and nitrative stress and this accounts for why theophylline is effective pa rticularly in severe as thma, where oxidative and nitrative stress are greatest. In creased reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide from increased expression of inducible nitric ox ide synthase results in the formation of peroxynitrite radicals. Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 731 Peroxynitrite is unstable and nitrates tyrosine residue s in proteins, which may result in altered protein function. Peroxynitrite is increased in COPD lungs [42,43] and is associated tyrosine nitration and [44] . to redu ce the formation of peroxynitrite and this provides a further mechanism for increasing HDAC2 function in asthma [45]. 4. Cellular Effects Theophylline has several cellular effects that may cont ribute to its clinical efficacy in the treatment of asthma (Figure 3). Figure 3. Multiple cellular effects of theophylline. 4.1. Airway Smooth Muscle Effects The primary effect of theophylline was assumed to be relaxation of airway smooth muscle and in vitro studies have shown that it is equally effec tive in large and small airways [46]. In airways obtained at lung surgery approximately 25% of preparations fail to rela x with a \u00df-agonist, but all relax with theophylline [47]. The molecular mechanism of bronchodilatation is almost certainly related to PDE inhibition, resulting in an increase in cyclic AMP [7]. PDE3 inhibiti on accounts for most of the bronchodilator effect, with no contribution from PDE4 inhibition in human airway smooth muscle. The bronchodilator effect of theophylline is redu ced in human airways by the toxin charybdotoxin, which inhibits large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (maxi-K channels), suggesting that theophylline opens maxi K channels via an increase in cyclic AMP [48]. Theophylline acts as a functional antagonist and inhibits the contractile re sponse of multiple spasmogens. In airways obtained at post-mortem from patients who have died from asthma the relaxant response to -agonists is reduced, whereas the bronchodilator re sponse to theophylline is no different from that seen in normal airways [49]. Theophylline is a w eak bronchodilator at therapeuti cally relevant concentrations, suggesting that some other target cell may be mo re relevant for its anti-asthma effect. In human airways the EC 50 for airway smooth muscle relaxation by theophylline is approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10-4 M, which is equivalent to 67 mg/L assuming 60% prot ein binding [47], that is well above the therapeutic Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 732 range. However, PDE activity may be increased in asthmatic airways as a result of inflammation so that theophylline may have a greater than expected effect. In vivo intravenous aminophylline has an acute bronchodila tor effect in asthmatic patients, which is most likely to be due to a relaxa nt effect on airway smooth muscle [50]. The bronchodilator effect of theophylline in chronic asthma is small in comparison with 2-agonists, however. Several studies have demonstrated a small protective effect of the ophylline on histamine, methacholine or exercise challenge [51-54]. This protective effect does not co rrelate well with any bronchodilator effect and the protective effect of theophylline may be observed at plasma concentrations of <10 mg/L. These clinical studies suggest that theophylline may have anti-asthma effects that are unrelated to any bronchodilator action. 4.2. Anti-inflammatory Effects There is increasing evidence that theophylline has anti-inflammatory effects in asthma and that these are seen at lower plasma concentrations than are needed for bronchodilatation. Theophylline inhibits mediator release from chopped human l ung [55], although high concentrations are necessary and it is likely that this effect involves an increas e in cyclic AMP concentration due to PDE inhibition. Theophylline also has an inhibitory effect on super oxide anion release from human neutrophils [56] and inhibits the feedback stimulatory effect of adenosine on neutrophils in vivo [57]. At therapeutic concentrations in vitro theophylline may increase superoxide release via an inhibitory effect on adenosine receptors, since endogenous adenosine may normally exert an inhibitory action on these cells [58]. Similar results are al so seen in guinea-pig and human eosinophils [59]. At therapeutic concentrations there is an increased release of superoxide anions from eosinophils, which appears to be mediated via inhibition of adenosine A 2-receptors and is antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline. Inhibition of eosinophil superoxide generation occurs only at high concentrations of theophylline (> 10-4 M) which are likely to inhibit PDE. Similar results have also been obtained in human alveolar macrophages [8]. Macrophages in bronchoalveo lar lavage fluid from patients taking theophylline have been found to have a reduced oxidative burst response [60], but there is no reduction in the re lease of the proinflammatory cytokines adenosine A 2A-receptors and this may be relevant in severe asthma [62]. In vivo theophylline inhibits mediator-induced airway microvascular leakage in rodents when given in high doses [63], although this is not seen at therapeutically relevant concentrations [64]. Theophylline has an inhibitory effect exuda tion in nasal secretions induced by allergen in patients with allergic rhinitis, although this could be secondary to inhibition of mediator release [65]. Microarray studies in macrophages show that theophylline has the greatest inhibitory effect on IL-13 expression [66]. In allergen challenge studies chronic oral treatm ent with theophylline redu ces the late response to allergen [67]. This has been interpreted as an effect on the chronic inflammatory response and is supported by a reduced infiltration of eosinophils into the airways af ter allergen cha llenge following low doses of theophylline [68]. In patients with noc turnal asthma low dose theophylline inhibits the influx of neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, eosinophils seen in the early morn ing [69]. Chronic treatment with low dose theophylli ne reduces the numbers of eosinophils in bronchial biopsies, Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 733 bronchoalveolar lavage and induced sputum of patients with mild as thma [61]. However these effects are less than those expected with low doses of inhaled corticosteroids a nd there is no reduction of exhaled nitric oxide, indicating a lesser effect on suppression of infl ammation than co rticosteroids. In patients with COPD, theophy reduces the proportion of neut rophils in induced sputum and reduces the concentration of IL-8, suggesting that it may have an anti-inflammatory effect unlike corticosteroids [70-72]. Since patients with severe asthma may have increased neutrophils in the airways [73,74], this may provide a mechanism where by theophylline is effective as an add-on therapy to high doses of inhaled cortic osteroids in these patients. 4.3. Immunomodulatory Effects T-lymphocytes are now believed to play a central role in coordinating th e chronic inflammatory response in asthma. Theophylline has several actio ns on T-lymphocyte function, suggesting that it might have an immunomodulatory effect in asth ma. Theophylline has a stimulatory effect on suppressor (CD8+) T-lymphocytes, which may be relevant to the control of chronic airway inflammation [75,76], and has an inhib itory effect on graft rejection [77]. In vitro theophylline inhibits IL-2 synthesis in human T-lymphocyte s, an effect that is secondary to a rise in intracellular cyclic AMP concentration [78]. At high concentrations theophylline inhibits proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+ cells, an effect that is mediated via inhibition of PDE4 [79]. Theophylli ne also inhibits the chemotactic response of T-lymphocytes, an effect that is also mediated through PDE inhibition [80]. In allergen- induced airway inflammation in guinea pigs, the ophylline has a significant inhibitory effect on eosinophil infiltration [81], suggesting that it may inhibit the T-cell-derived cytokines responsible for this eosinophilic response. Theophylline has been repor ted to decrease circulating concentrations of IL-4 and IL-5 in asthmatic patients [82]. In as thmatic patients low dose th eophylline treatment results in an increase in activated circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, but a decrease in these cells in the airways, suggesting that it may reduce the trafficking of activated T cells into the airways [83]. This is supported by studies in allergen challenge, wh ere low dose theophylline decreases the activated and CD8+ T-cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after allergen challenge and this is mirrored by an increase in these cells in peripheral blood [84]. These effects are seen even in patients treated with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, indicating that th e molecular effects of theophylline are likely to be different from those of cort icosteroids. Theophylline induces apoptosis of T- lymphocytes, thus reducing their survival [32]. This effect may be mediated via PDE4 inhibition, so may not be relevant to clinical doses of theophylline. The therapeutic range of theophylline was based on measurement of immediate bronchodilatation in response to the acute administration of theophylline [50]. However, it is possible that the non-bronchodilato r effects of theophylline, which may reflect some anti-inflammatory or immunomodul atory effect, may be ex erted at lower plasma concentrations and that different mol ecular mechanisms may be involved [85]. 4.4. Extrapulmonary Effects It has been suggested that theophyl line may exert its effects in asthma via some action outside the airways. It may be relevant that theophylline is in effective when given by inhalation until therapeutic plasma concentrations are achieved [86]. This may i ndicate that theophylline has effects on cells other Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 734 than those in the airway. An effect of theophy lline which remains controversial is its action on respiratory muscles. Aminophylline increases diaphr agmatic contractility and reverses diaphragm fatigue [87]. This effect has not been observed by all investigators but there are doubts about the relevance of these observations to the clinic al benefit provided by theophylline [88]. Whether theophylline has any effects on system ic effects or co-morbidities in COPD patients has not yet been established. 5. Pharmacokinetics There is a close relationship between the acute improvement in airway function and serum theophylline concentration. Below 10 mg/L therapeutic effects (at least in term s of rapid improvement in airway function) are small and above 25 mg/L add itional benefits are outweighed by side effects, so that the therapeutic rang e was usually taken as 10-20 mg/L (55-110 \u00b5M) [2]. It is now apparent that non-bronchodilator effects of theophylline may be seen at plasma concentrations of <10 mg/L and that clinical benefit may be derived from these lower c oncentrations of theophyllin e. This suggests that it may be necessary to redefine the therapeutic rang e of theophylline based on anti-asthma effect, rather than the acute bronchodilator re sponse that requires a higher plas ma concentration. The dose of theophylline required to give therapeutic concentra tions varies among patients, largely because of differences in clearance. Theophyl line is rapidly and completely ab sorbed, but there are large inter- individual variations in clearance, due to differences in hepatic metabolism (Table 2). Theophylline is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 microsomal enzyme system, and a large number of factors may influence hepatic metabolism. Theophy lline is predominantly metabolized by the CYP1A2 enzyme, while at higher plasma concentr ations CYP2E1 is also involved (89). Table 2. Factors affecting clea rance of theophylline. Increased Congestive heart failure High protein, low carbohydrate diet Liver disease Barbecued meat Pneumonia Childhood Viral infection Vaccination (immunization) High carbohydrate diet Old age 5.1. Increased Clearance Increased clearance is seen in children (1-16 y ears), and in cigarette and marijuana smokers. Concurrent administration of phenytoin and phenoba rbitone increases activity of P450, resulting in increased metabolic breakdown, so th at higher doses may be required. Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 735 5.2. Reduced Clearance Reduced clearance is found in liver disease, pneumonia and heart failure and doses need to be reduced to half and plasma levels monitored carefu lly. Decreased clearance is also seen with certain drugs, including erythromycin, certain quinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxaci n, but not which interfere with CYP 1A2 function. Thus, if a patient on maintenance theophylline requires a course of er ythromycin, the dose of theophylline should be halved. Viral infections and vaccinations (immunizat ions) may also reduce clearance, and this may be particularly important in children. Because of th ese variations in clearance, individualization of theophylline dosage is required and plasma concentra tions should be measured 4 h after the last dose with slow-release preparations, when steady state ha s usually been achieved. There is no significant circadian variation in th eophylline metabolism [90]. 6. Routes of Administration 6.1. Intravenous Intravenous aminophylline has been used for many ye ars in the treatment of acute severe asthma. The recommended dose is now 6 mg/kg give n intravenously over 20-30 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/kg/h. If the patient is already taking theophylline, or there are any factors which decrease clearance, these doses should be halv ed and the plasma level checked more frequently. 6.2. Oral Plain theophylline tablets or elixir, which are rapi dly absorbed, give wide fluctuations in plasma levels and are not recommended. Several effective su stained-release preparations now available are absorbed at a constant rate and provide steady plasma concentrations over a 12-24 h period. Although there are differences between preparations, these are relatively minor and of no clinical significance. Both slow-release aminophylline and theophylline are available and are equally effective (although the ethylene diamine component of aminophylline has very occasionally been implicated in allergic reactions). For continuous treatment, twice daily therapy (approximately 8 mg/kg twice daily) is needed, although some preparations are designed for once daily admi nistration. For nocturnal asthma, a single dose of slow-release theophylline at night may be effective [91,92]. Once optimal doses have been determined plasma concentrations usually remain stable, providing no factors which alter clearance are introduced. 6.3. Other Routes Aminophylline may be given as a suppository, but rect al absorption is unreli able and pr octitis may occur, so this route should be avoided. Inhalati on of theophylline is irrita ting and ineffective [86]. Intramuscular injections of theophylline ar e very painful and should never be given. Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 736 7. Clinical Use 7.1. Acute Exacerbations Intravenous aminophylline has been used in the management of acute severe asthma for over 50 years, but this use has been questioned in view of the risk of adverse effects compared with nebulized \u00df 2-agonists. In patients with acute asthma, in is less effective than nebulized \u00df 2-agonists [93], and should therefore be rese rved for those who fail to respond to \u00df- agonists. In a meta-analysis of 27 studies which looked at addition of iv aminophylline to nebulized 2- agonists, there is no evidence for sign ificant benefit in adults [94] or children [95]. This indicates that aminophylline should not be added routinely to nebulized \u00df-agonists. Indeed, addition of aminophylline only increases adverse effects. Severa l deaths have been re ported after intravenous aminophylline. In one study of 43 asthma deaths in southern England there was a significantly greater frequency of toxic theophylline concentrations (21% ) compared with matched controls (7%) [96]. These concerns have lead to the view that intr avenous aminophylline should be reserved for the few patients with acute severe asthma who fail to show a satisfactory response to nebulized 2-agonists. When intravenous aminophylline is used it should be given as a slow intrave nous infusion with careful monitoring of vital signs and plasma theophylline con centrations should be meas ured prior to and after infusion. Aminophylline similarly has no place in th e routine management of COPD exacerbations [97,98]. 7.2. Chronic Asthma In most guidelines for asthma management theophylline is recommended as an additional bronchodilator if asthma remains difficult to contro l after high doses of inha led corticosteroids. The introduction of long-acting inhaled 2-agonists has further threatened the position of theophylline, since the side effects of these agen ts may be less frequent that thos e associated with theophylline and long-acting inhaled 2-agonists are more effective controlle rs than theophylline [99]. Whether theophylline has some additional benefit over it s bronchodilator action is now an important consideration. In chronic asthma oral theophylline provides additional control of asthma symptoms even in patients talking regular inhaled steroids [100]. In an uncontrolled study a group of adolescent patients with severe asthma who were controlle d with oral and inhaled steroids, nebulized 2-agonists, inhaled anticholinergics and sodium cromoglycate, in addition to regular oral theophylline, withdrawal of the oral theophylline resulted in a marked deterioration of as thma control which could not be controlled by further increase in steroids and onl y responded to reintroduction of theophylline [101]. This suggests that there may be a group of severe asthmatic patients who pa rticularly benefit from theophylline. In a controlled trial of theophylline withdrawal in patient s with severe asthma controlled only on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, ther e was a significant deterior ation in symptoms and lung function when placebo was substituted for the relatively low maintenance dose of theophylline [83]. There is also evidence that addition of theophylline improves asthma control to a greater extent than 2-agonists in patients with severe asthma treated with high dose inhaled steroi ds [102]. This suggests that theophylline may have a useful place in the optimal management of moderate to severe Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 737 asthma and appears to provide a dditional control above that provide d by high dose i nhaled steroids [103,104]. Theophylline may be a useful treatment for nocturn al asthma and a single dose of a slow release theophylline preparation given at ni ght may provide effective control of nocturnal asthma symptoms [91,92]. Theophylline has equal efficacy to salmeterol in controlling nocturnal asthma, but the quality of sleep is better with salmeter ol compared to theophylline [ 105]. The mechanism of action of theophylline in nocturnal asthma may involve mo re than long-lasting br onchodilatation, and could involve inhibition of some components of the inflamma tory response, which may in crease at night [69]. 7.3. Add-on Therapy Several studies have demonstrated that adding lo w dose theophylline to inhaled corticosteroids in patients who are not controlled gives better as thma control than doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids. This has been demonstrated in pa tients with moderate to severe and mild asthma [106-108]. Interestingly, there is a greater degree of improvement in forced vital capacity than in FEV 1, possibly indicating an effect on peripheral airw ays. Since the improvement in lung function was relatively slow, this suggests that the effect of the added theophylline may be having an anti-inflammatory rather than a bronchodilator effect, particularly as the plasma concentration of theophylline in these studies was < 10 mg/L. These studies suggest that low dose theophylline may be preferable to increasing the dose of inhaled steroids when asthma is not controlled on moderate doses of inhaled steroids; such a therapeutic approach would be much less expens ive than adding long-acting inhaled 2-agonists. However, theophylline is a less eff ective option than adding a long-acting inhaled 2-agonist [99]. Low dose theophylline is also e ffective in smoking asthmatics, who have a poor response to inhaled steroids and this may through increasing HDAC2 activity, wh ich is reduced in the airways asthmatic patie nts who smoke [109]. 7.4. COPD Theophylline may also benefit patients with CO PD and increases exerci se tolerance [110,111]. Theophylline reduces air trapping, suggesting an effect on peripheral airways, and this may explain why some patients with COPD may obtain considerable symptomatic improvement without any increase in spirometric values [112]. The dem onstration that low doses of theophylline reduces neutrophils in induced sputum of patients with CO PD suggests that theophylline may have some anti- inflammatory effect 113]. In COPD macrophages in vitro theophylline restores HDAC activity to normal and thus reverses corticostero id resistance [40]. It also reduces nitrative stress in macrophages from patients with COPD, whereas high doses of an i nhaled corticosteroid are without effect [45]. Low dose theophylline increases the recovery from an acu te exacerbation of COPD and this is associated with reduced inflammation and increased HDAC activit y [114]. This suggests th at corticosteroids may be useful in reversing cort icosteroid resistance in patients with COPD, but long-term clinical trials are now needed to confirm this [115,116]. Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 738 7.5. Interaction with \u00df If a sy nergistic interaction with \u00df-agonists would be expected. Many studies have inve stigated this possibility, but wh ile there is good evidence that theophylline and \u00df-agonists have additive effects, true synergy is not seen. 2-Agonists may cause relaxation of airway smooth muscle via several mechanisms. Classicall y, they increase intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations, which were believed to be an essential event in the relaxation response. However, 2-agonists cause bronchodilatation, at least in part, by opening maxi-K channels in airway smooth muscle cells [48]. Maxi-K channels are opened by low concentrations of \u00df 2-agonists which are likely to be therapeutically relevant. 2-Receptors may be coupled dire ctly to maxi-K channels via the -subunit of G s and therefore may induce relaxation wit hout any increase in cyclic AMP, thus accounting for a lack of synergy [117]. Repeated administration of 2-agonists may result in to lerance; however, this may be explained by down-regulation of 2-receptors, an additional mechanism may involve up-regulation of PDE enzymes (especially PDE4D) which then break down cycl ic AMP more readily [118]. Theophylline may therefore theoretically prevent the development of tolerance. Howeve r, in a clinical study theophylline failed to prevent the development of tolerance to the bronchoprotec tive effect of salmeterol in asthmatic patients [119]. 8. Side Effects The main limitation to the use of theophylline in conventional doses has been the high frequency of adverse effects [120]. Unwanted effects of theophyllin e are usually related to plasma concentration and tend to occur when plasma levels exceed 20 mg/L; however, some patients develop side-effects even at low plasma concentrations. To some extent side effects may be reduced by gradually increasing the dose until therapeutic concentrations are achieved. The commonest side effects ar e headache, nausea and vomiti ng, abdominal discomfort and restlessness. There may also be in creased acid secretion, gastroesophage al reflux and diur esis. At high concentrations convulsions and card iac arrhythmias may occur and, as stated previously, there is concern that intravenous aminophylline administered in the emergency room may be a contributory factor to the deaths of some pa tients with severe asthma [96]. Some of the side-effects of theo phylline (central stimulation, ga stric secretion, diuresis and arrhythmias) may be due to adenosine receptor antagonism (A 1A receptors) and these may therefore be avoided by PDE inhibitors or by doxifylline when it is available, as discussed above. The commonest side effects of theophylline are nausea and headaches , which may be due to i nhibition of certain PDEs (e.g., PDE4 in the vomiting center) and cardiac arrhythmias due to inhibition of PDE3 [121]. 9. Future Developments Although theophylline has recently been used much less in developed countri es, there are reasons for thinking that it may come back in fashion for th e treatment of severe asthma, smoking asthma and COPD, with the recognition that it may have an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effect when given in low doses (plasma concentration 5-10 mg /L) [3]. At these low doses the drug is easier Pharmaceuticals 2010 , 3 739 to use, side effects are uncommon and the problems of drug interaction are less of a problem, thus making the clinical use of theophylline less complicate d. Theophylline appears to have an effect that is different from those of corticosteroids and it may th erefore be a useful drug to combine with low dose inhaled steroids. The molecular mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects of theophylline is now becoming clearer and it seems likely that there is a synergistic interaction with the anti-inflammatory mechanism of corticostero ids through restoration of HDAC activ ity. This interaction may underlie the beneficial effects of theophylline when added to i nhaled corticosteroids. Th is may be particularly appropriate in patients with more severe asthma in whom corticosteroids ar e less effective as there may be a reduction in HDAC activity in these patients [37] as well as in smoking asthmatics patients [109] and patients with COPD [114]. As slow-releas e theophylline preparations are cheaper than long- acting inhaled 2-agonists and leukotriene modifiers, th is may justify the choice of low dose theophylline as the add-on therapy for asthma contro l. In addition, compliance with oral therapy is likely to be greater than with inhaled therapies [122]. This suggests that low dose theophylline may find an important place in the management in patients of patients with severe asthma and all patients with COPD. References 1. Lam, A.; Newhouse, M.T.
