Correspondence Address: Professor Graham Roberts, Paediatric Allergy and Respiratory Medicine, University Child Health (MP803), University Hospital, Southampton NHS Biologics have proven efficacy for patients with severe asthma but there is lack of consensus on defining response. We systematically review ed and appraised methodologically developed, defined, and evaluated definitions of non-response and response to biologics for severe asthma. Methods: We searched four bibliographic databases from inception to 15th March 2021 (PROSPERO: CRD42021211249) . Two reviewers screened references, extracted data, assessed methodological quality of development, measurement properties of outcome measures and definitions of response based on COnsensus- based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) . Modified GRADE approach and narrative synthesis were undertaken. Results: Thirteen studies reported three composite outcome measures, three measures of asthma symptoms , one asthma control and one quality of life. Only four were developed with patient input; none were composite measures . Studies utilised 17 definitions of response : 10/17 ( 58.8%) were based on Minimal Clinical ly Important Difference (MCID) or Minimal Important Difference (MID) and 16/17 (94.1%) had high quality evidence . Results were limited by poor methodology for development process and incomplete reporting of psychometric properties. Most measures rated 'very low ' to 'low' for quality of measurement properties and no ne met all quality standards. Conclusion: This is the first review to synthesize evidence about definitions of response to biologics for severe asthma . While high quality definitions are available, most are MCIDs or MIDs which may be insufficient to justify continuation of biologics in terms of cost-effectiveness. There remains an unmet need for universally accept ed, patient-centred, composite definitions to aid clinical decision making and comparability of responses to biologics. Keywords: biological therapy, treatment response, severe asthma, outcome measures, validity. Take home message: There are no patient-centred composite measures of response to biologics for severe asthma. Single outcome measures are available but do not meet quality standards. A composite measure is required that is developed with patients. INTRODUCTION According to the European Respiratory Society (ERS) / American Thoracic Society (ATS) guideline, severe asthma is defined as asthma requiring treatment based on GINA steps 4 -5 for the previous year or oral corticosteroids (OCS) for 50% of the previous year either to prevent the disease becoming uncontrolled or disease which remains uncontrolled despite this therapy1. Even though severe asthma only affects 5% to 10% of the total population with asthma1, it represents a significant socio-economic2-6, psychological7,8, and treatment9 burden and is also be associated with risk of mortality10,11. Over the past decades, new biological drugs have demonstrated positive impact on the lives of many patients with severe asthma by reducing the frequency of exacerbations and dose of OCS and by improving lung function.12-15 Recently, in addition to total lgE, blood eosinophil count and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) have been suggested as a guide to initiate anti-IgE treatment in adolescents and adults16.Furthermore, blood eosinophil counts have been used to select patients for anti- IL-516 in adults and FeNO/blood eosinophil count for Dupilumab17 in adolescents and adults. Several studies have described the characteristics of patients who started biologics18,19 and characteristics of responders to treatment20-23. It has been shown that some patients reached a 'super response '24 or 'partial response '25, whereas others experienced a 'non -response'24 or even deterioration26 of clinical and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Although many studies have measured responses to different biologics, there are no universally accepted criteria for what constitutes response , and the absence of guidance on criteria is reported as a high priority research gap in both children and adults.27,28 Evidence about responder definitions is critical for understanding the effectiveness of treatment for patients, clinicians and regulatory bodies, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA)29 and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)30. Minimal Clinical ly Important Difference (MCID)31 and Minimal Important Difference (MID)32 are often used for assessing responses: these are defined as the smallest relevant within-person change or group differences between treatments, respectively. According to the FDA report, it is useful to report intra-subject responses based on a priori responder definition.30 In November 2016, a Task Force reached a consensus on a traffic-light system to classify patients as non- responders, intermediate- or super-responders.33 They suggest that patients need to be on biological treatment for at least four months before an initial assessment of response can be determined.33 However, this proposal has neither been validated nor further developed. Given the unmet need to use consistent definitions of response for paediatric and adult patients, we aim ed to 1) synthesize evidence about definitions of non-response and response to biological therapy used in patients with severe asthma ; 2) assess the quality of the evidence for these definitions, and 3) evaluate the development, measurement properties and quality of outcome measures as supporting evidence for the included definitions . We chose to restrict our systematic review to studies where definitions were methodologically developed, defined, and evaluated. Comprehensive assessment of response in clinical practice and trials using pre-specified consensus criteria should provide useful guidance for clinical decision making, allow comparison across studies, eliminate unnecessary treatment in patients with inadequate response and ensure that the high-cost associated with biological therapies34 is justified35. METHODS This was a systematic review conducted by the 3TR (Taxonomy, treatment, targets and remission)36 respiratory work package members and external collaborators including academic clinicians, regulatory , patient, and pharmaceutical representatives from across Europe. It is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO registration: CRD42021211249) . Our aim was to look at response in severe asthma but in anticipation that the evidence base would be limited, we initially included studies of all severities of asthma. However, given that there is evidence for definitions of response to biological therapy for severe asthma, the protocol was revised to restrict the systematic review to studies of severe asthma. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) checklist has been used to structure this article37 (Appendix 1). The methods are briefly described here. Details are available in the supplementary materials. Search strategy Four databases were searched (Embase (OVID); MEDLINE (OVID); CINAHL (EBSCOhost, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature); ISI Web of Science (Thomson Web of Knowledge)) using a search strategy developed on EMBASE (OVID) and then adapted for other databases (Appendix 2 ). In summary, the search strategy was designed to identify papers focused on asthma AND a biological therapy AND response/treatment outcome/minimal important difference . Databases were searched from the inception to 15th March 2021. Additional references were searched through the references cited by the identified studies, systematic reviews, reviews, guidelines or highlighted by experts in the field. Inclusion criteria Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: Population: children/adolescents (from 6 years until 17 years) and/or adults ( 18 years) with a diagnosis of severe asthma. Intervention: any biological therapy which was investigated and/or currently used for severe asthma. Comparator: any comparator, including placebo or no comparator . Outcomes: any definitions of non-response and response to biological therapy for severe asthma which were methodologically developed, defined, and evaluated. Sole or a composite of clinical, patient reported, biological and/or imaging outcome measures were eligible for inclusion. Additional evidence about these outcome measures including development (undertaken in studies of any severity of asthma) and validation (conducted in studies with biologicals for severe asthma) was included. Study types: randomised controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, controlled before-and-after studies, non- randomised controlled studies, case-control studies in humans, cohort studies, and consecutive case series (with a minimum of 10 participants) published as full-text articles and letters published in English were eligible for inclusion. Additional evidence about development and validation of outcome measures w as considered from qualitative and validation studies. Exclusion criteria The following manuscripts were excluded from the analysis: systematic reviews and meta-analyses, narrative reviews, discussion papers, editorials, commentaries, case reports, animal studies, conference abstracts, studies not available in full form, published in a language other than English, unpublished material, non-asthma studies such as viral bronchiolitis or viral associated wheeze. Studies were also excluded if they only used outcome measures and definitions of response to assess treatment effectiveness or efficacy. Study selection All references were pooled and de-duplicated in Endnote version X9, and subsequently uploaded to Rayyan (rayyan.qcri.org), where any remaining duplicates were removed. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were independently screened by two reviewers (EK, AR) according to the above selection criteria and categorized as included, excluded or unsure . Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (GR). Data extraction, risk of bias assessment, quality, and synthesis of the results Data extraction was based on the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of Measurement Instruments) guideline38 for outcome measures. Definitions of the measurement properties provided by COSMIN are in Table S1 and criteria for good measurement properties (GMP) in Table S2. Risk of Bias (RoB) of individual studies was assessed using the COSMIN checklist for PROMs39,40 and composite outcome measures (COSMIN RoB for non-Patient Reported Outcomes)41. RoB for each measurement property in the validation studies was rated as very good, adequate, doubtful, or inadequate. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.38,40,42 Data extraction, RoB assessment and modified GRADE were completed independently by two reviewers independe ntly (EK, AR). Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer (GR) . A descriptive synopsis with summary data tables were produced, and results were summarized using narrative synthesis. Detailed methods are provided in Appendix 3 . The results were reviewed and discussed within the Core Outcome Measures for Severe Asthma (COMSA) initiative43 that included a multidisciplinary, European group of academic clinicians, regulatory, patient, and pharmaceutical representatives . The group aimed to select the core outcome measure sets for paediatric and adult severe asthma. RESULTS Description of studies Our search strategy identified a total of 11588 papers and 11553 articles were excluded after title and abstract screening. The full text of 35 papers were assessed for eligibility, including 20 articles identified through review of citations. Thirteen papers were included in the systematic review of which three were about development of the outcome measures44-46 , five were validation papers47-51 and five52-56 reported development and validation data in the same manuscript. (Figure 1) Development and quality of definitions of non-response and response The approach to development of definitions and their characteristics are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Definitions were developed for three composite asthma outcome measures51-53, three asthma symptoms measures49,50, one asthma control55, and one quality of life (QoL) measure.48 The following methods of development were used: consensus53,55, anchor-based48-51 and distribution-based52 methods. Ten definitions measured response based on MCID48,49,51 or MID50,52 and seven50,55 benralizumab48,53, reslizumab48,53 and mepolizumab48,49,53 were predominantly used in these studies. Response was evaluated at different time points including as early as 4 weeks48 and up to 12 months52. Most definitions were developed for adults48-50,52,53 while three were for adolescents49,51,52 and one for children51 with severe asthma. The quality of the evidence for definitions of response w as rated as 'high ' for all except 'moderate ' for Asthma Severity Scoring System (ASSESS)52 due to a lower number of patients taking biologics. Development and content validity of the outcome measures An overview of the developmental process and its quality are shown in Table 2, S3. The developmental process was predominantly rated as 'sufficient ', while quality of evidence was mainly 'very low ' to 'low', but 'moderate ' for the Severe Asthma Questionnaire ( SAQ )45,54. Three composite outcome measures were developed by physicians, including the FEOS (FEV1, Exacerbations, Oral Corticosteroids, Symptoms Score)53 for adults, the ASSESS52, which was adapted from the Composite Asthma Symptom Index (CASI)56 for adolescents/adults and children with asthma, respectively . The Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE)55 scale was also developed by physicians. Only four outcomes were developed with patient input including the SAQ45,54, Asthma Symptom Diary (ASD)44, Asthma Symptom Utility Index (ASUI)49, and Asthma Symptom Index (ASI)46 which was adapted from ASUI by excluding questions about medication side effects . A summary of key instrument characteristics and feasibility is in Table 4, S4. Risk of bias and quality of evidence for validation studies of outcome measures Validation data including RoB are shown in Table S5-S7 and methodological quality of the outcome measures rated against criteria for GMP in Table 3 . Overall, almost all outcome measures had 'inadequate ' RoB due to lack of involvement of patients in the development , many measurement properties not being reported and none of the studies reporting cross-cultural validity including measurement invariance. The GETE scale has patient and physician versions which demonstrated high quality of evidence for the construct validity, although there was a positive skew towards 'complete control of asthma' and 'marked improvement of asthma' possibly due to the ceiling effect.55 CASI56 showed insufficient responsiveness but 'high ' quality of evidence. Sufficient measurement properties were rated for ASSESS, including test-retest reliability, construct validity and responsiveness to change while the quality was mostly 'very low '. ASUI49 and ASI49 performed similarly and showed sufficient rating against GMP criteria and 'low' to 'high ' quality. The SAQ47,48,54 again showed sufficient properties and 'very low ' to 'moderate ' quality of evidence . Only responsiveness to change was evaluated for ASD50 as assessment of other measurement properties was not performed in patients taking biologics for severe asthma. The FEOS scale 53 only contains data about inter-rater agreement which was not possible to assess based on the COSMIN methodology. DISCUSSION This study aimed to review the literature on definitions of response and non-response to biological therapy for severe asthma. To the best of our knowledge, the current systematic review is the first to synthesise methodologically developed, defined, and evidenced definitions . We identified eight outcome measures including three composite outcome measures, three measuring asthma symptoms, one asthma control and one QoL measure. Studies utilised a variety of definitions of response criteria, mostly using MCIDs or MIDs where available and measured at different time-points for different biologics. Only the GETE55 defined a non-response, while the FEOS 53 is a scale ranging from 0 to 100 (best), with n o established cut-off for non-responders. One of the aims of the review was to assess the development and measurement properties of the identified outcome measures. Results were limited by 'very low' to 'low' quality of evidence for the development process except for the SAQ45,54, and incomplete reporting of measurement properties for all outcome measures. Based on the COSMIN guideline, none of the outcome measures met all the quality standards. Only four outcome measures were developed with patient input, even though this is considered as a vital step in ensuring that the instrument is meaningful for patients . Responsiveness to change was rated as 'low' to 'very low' while definitions of response had 'high' quality except for ASSESS52. Evaluation of therapeutic response in asthma has received increased attention with the introduction of biological treatments to improve disease treatment and precision management.57 More than 70% of patients achieved good or excellent response to omalizumab based on GETE58; however, this relies on a single global measure to reflect the heterogeneous response to biological treatment. Thus, the GETE do es not discriminate the different effects of a treatment on different response areas, such as QoL, exacerbations, maintenance corticosteroid use and lung function. Two asthma symptoms questionnaires ( ASUI and ASI49) were designed to assess cost-effectiveness of treatment, while ASD50 is a symptom diary and might impose too much burden on participants of biological therapy trials. The SAQ54, which was developed with patient input, showed the best quality of evidence, and was selected in the COMSA.43,59 Several composite outcome measures were identified. Neither CASI56 nor ASSESS52 include a QoL domain and CASI56 does not assess maintenance OCS use ; even though reduction in OCS use and improvement of QoL has been shown to be the best indicators of response to treatment for patients with severe asthma60. The t wo-point MID for ASSESS showed good specificity but poor sensitivity and the authors suggested that it should be interpreted with caution until more data are available52. The FEOS tool to quantify response53 was developed for adults with severe asthma using novel methodology, but patients were not involved in the selection of outcome measures, and it may not also represent the perspectives of international stakeholders. Unlike the COMSA initiative43, the validity of the included outcome measures for severe asthma was not assessed and exclusion of aspects such as QoL may not represent a patient-centred approach. This systematic review did not identify any studies which validated definitions of response to biological therapy using clinical outcome measures in patients with severe asthma. Some data are available from the consensus statements, for example, the MID for FEV 1 is 0.20 L13 or 10% improvement61 and for FeNO a reduction of at least 20% for values over 50 ppb ( or 10ppb for values lower than 50 ppb) should be used to indicate response to anti-inflammatory therapy.62 While a published composite definition of exacerbation has been developed and validated in patients with seve re asthma taking benralizumab , no MCID data are available yet.63 Most outcome measures identified in the systematic review utilised MCIDs or MIDs to assess response, but we do not regard these definitions as interchangeable; for example, in one paper the term MID was used when it would seem to be more appropriate to use MCID51. An improvement that patients might recognise as equivalent to MCID with an inhaled asthma therapy may potentially be rated as less than the MCID in the context of high cost34,35 biologics administered by injection. Also, to be regarded as cost-effective a biological therapy will demand a greater magnitude of response than a less expensive asthma therapy. A further critical variable may be the duration of response, given the case reports of secondary loss of response64 i.e. the loss of response during the treatment over time despite an initial primary response65,66. The conce pt of 'super -responders' to biological treatment has emerged recently.24,67 In order to standardise the definition, a modified Delphi exercise among healthcare professionals has been conducted but there is a need to understand patient perspectives.68 The rate of super-responders in patients prescribed anti-IL5 depending on criteria ranges from 14% to 28%24,67,69, forming a small but important group. Super-response should be the ultimate goal of treatment. However, patients who fail to achieve such a level of improvement may still benefit from biological therapies. Nevertheless, consideration should be given in such cases as to whether a different biological may be more beneficial. Evaluation of a complete response, as in haematological disorders70,71, may be inappropriate in severe asthma since only a very small percentage of patients experience remission72. Unfortunately, some patients with severe asthma do not respond to biological therapy and may even deteriorate. Differences in treatment response may be multifactorial, reflecting medicinal and/or subject variables including mechanisms of action, target, dose and interval of the biological drug or heterogeneity of asthma phenotypes73. For example, non-response might reflect differences in the pharmacokinetics of biological drugs; indeed monitoring plasma monoclonal antibody levels appears useful in various chronic diseases.74-76 Overall, assessing the non-response and response after several months of treatment with biologics facilitates cost control by reducing the duration of ineffective therapy, and should enable better quality of care and patient experience by prescribing alternative treatments including switching to another biological77 if appropriate. The latter is especially important given the rapidly increasing number of therapeutic options for patients with severe asthma.1,16 Strengths and limitations This systematic review was conducted by a diverse group of academic clinicians, patient representatives , regulatory, and pharmaceutical representatives. This was a strength because it meant that definitions were considered on clinical and patient-centred grounds. A comprehensive search was conducted in four databases and provides a summary of the robust research. Rigorous methods were used including RoB assessment and GMP based on COSMIN followed by the modified GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. Using transparent and validated COSMIN methodology helped to standardize the quality assessment of outcome measures and reduce bias. Many studies were excluded as they used arbitrary definitions of response; only methodologically developed definitions and validated outcome measures were considered for inclusion in the systematic review. Lastly, all studies used data from large number of paediatric and adult patients with severe asthma who were treated with a variety of biological therapies such as omalizumab, brodalumab, benralizumab, reslizumab and mepolizumab. Nevertheless, we recognise several limitations. First, only studies published in English were included; however, we screened studies included in the guidelines, previous systematic reviews, references of identified articles , and reviews which made it highly unlikely that relevant studies were missed. Second, the search was conducted in 2021 as part of the development of the COMSA which w as published in 2022.43 Third, we only searched the literature related to biological therapies and did not look at the evidence from response to non-biological asthma therapies. Biologic s have different mechanisms of action, administration approaches, cost and potential adverse effects. Therefore, response criteria could differ with different patient views on what counts as beneficial response given these considerations . However, it may be possible to also learn from the response to other therapies such as to oral and inhaled corticosteroids in severe asthma. Fourth, definitions of therapeutic response were assessed at different time points which might make it difficult to come to definitive conclusions about non-responders and responders. Moreover, COSMIN suggest using the lowest score counts method to assess measurement properties, meaning that having higher quality scores on some items of the checklist were not considered and only the 'worst score' was reported. Lastly, it was not possible to run a meta-analysis due to low number of studies per outcome measure and only narrative synthesis was undertaken. Policy implications and next steps This systematic review aimed to inform clinicians, regulators, and policy makers about the gaps and highlight heterogeneity of the definitions used. Even though, asthma control questionnaire/test and asthma quality of life questionnaire are widely used in the phase 3 trials of asthma biologicals and in clinical practice, definitions of response including MCID or MID have never been specifically assessed in biologics. Further research should aim to explore the identified definitions as primary and secondary outcomes in clinical trials including phase 2 and 3 efficacy studies and assess MCID/MID of well-validated questionnaires in biological trials. There is also a need to methodologically develop patient-centred definitions of non-response and response to biological therapy for severe asthma for individual PROMs and clinical as well as a composite outcome measures. For example, based on COSMIN40methodology for assessing the content validity of PROMs, patients should be asked about their relevan ce, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility . Engagement of patients is a crucial aspect of the development of outcome measures to meet their needs and preferences as well as to inform health decisions.78,79 Given the above, we are planning to develop definitions of non-response and response to biological therapies for paediatric and adult severe asthma trials and clinical practice based on the COMSA selected among key stakeholder groups including patients with severe asthma.43 We aim to standardise the definitions which will allow better tailoring of individual treatment and be used in future clinical trials for documenting therapeutic response . Furthermore, looking at multiple dimensions of asthma, such as exacerbations, QoL, asthma control, lung function in one single patient-centred composite would help to determine the correct sample size for future clinical trials, assist regulators in determining whether a new biological therapy is effective and identify predictors of treatment response. Use of such definitions will also help in better understanding the applicability of novel biomarkers such as volatile organic compounds80, peripheral blood gene expression81,82, and serum periostin83 in the prediction and monitoring of response which have been shown to be promising in biological treatment for severe asthma. CONCLUSION This systematic review is the first to evaluate the quality of evidence for definitions of response to biological therapy for severe asthma and measurement properties of associated outcome measures. There are several high-quality definitions available for use which are mostly based on MIDs or MCID s which might not be sufficient to justify continuation of biological therapy on cost-effectiveness criteria. Even though composite outcome measures are available and able to capture the multi-dimensional nature of severe asthma, none were developed with patient input and all lack a QoL component. The quality of evidence for the development and validation of the outcome measures was rated predominantly 'low' and 'very low' and none met all the methodological quality standards, highlighting an urgent unmet need. Therefore, the forthcoming 3TR project will aim to develop the definitions of non-response and response based on COMSA43 with involvement of patient representatives and other key stakeholders. Future research will be needed to pilot these definitions in biological trials and to address practical implications for policy makers, research, and clinical practice. Knowing how to evaluate response to biologics using universally acceptable criteria would help in assessing effectiveness of novel therapies, improve clinical decision-making and the care of patients with severe asthma.

Good measurement properties for each measurement property were rated based on the COSMIN criteria38,40 as either sufficient in bold (+), insufficient (-), indeterminate (?), or inconsistent (\u00b1, for development criteria only). Empty cells or indeterminate (?) ratings indicate that the measurement property was not investigated or there is insufficient information. Structural validity, internal consistency, measurement error and cross-cultural validity are not shown in the table for all outcome measures due to the same reasons . For construct validity and responsiveness, the review team formulated a priori hypotheses about the expected relationships between an outcome measure and comparator instruments. Overall, 75% of the pooled results for the measurement property were expected to meet the criteria in order to be classified as a sufficient rating.38 *Physician and patient version of GETE were graded similarly. Assessment of the development was based on reviewer rating only. **Only external validation data was used for analysis as it was performed in a study with biologics. ***As there is no golden standard in asthma, data about criterion validity was combined with construct validity. SAQ is based on a formative model; therefore, there was no need to assess structural validity and internal consistency. # Ratings apply to SAQ subscales (My Life, My Mind, My Body) and SAQ - global. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the modified GRADE approach as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' .38,40,42 The reasons for were as follows: A, risk of bias; B, inconsistency; C, indirectness.

Detailed methods Data extraction, risk of bias assessment, quality, and synthesis of the results . Data extraction was based on the COSMIN (COnsensus -based Standards for the selection of Measurement Instruments) guideline1 for outcome measures. Data about study design; popul ation characteristics and subgroups including sample size; asthma definition and severity; intervention and comparator (where appropriate); follow -up period; methodological approach to defining therapeutic response; definition of response and non-response ( sole or composite outcome measures) , development data, data on measurement properties (including: reliability (internal consistency, reliability, measurement error) , validity (content, construct validity , responsiveness to change)) and charac teristics of the outcome measurements were extracted into a template form independently by two reviewers (EK , AR). Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer (GR) . The final extraction w as cross -checked. Authors of included studie s were contacted to provide additional data if needed. Two reviewers (EK,AR) independently assessed the Risk of Bias (RoB) in individual studies using the COSMIN checklist for PROMs2,3 and composite outcome measures (COSMIN RoB for non -Patient Reported Outcomes )4. Criterion validity was not evaluated a s no gold standard exists in severe asthma. First, development of the outcome measures w as assessed based on relevance, comprehensiveness , and comprehensibility according to ten criteria.3 Each criterion was rated as positive (+), negative ( -), or indeterminate (?). The overall rating was provided as sufficient (+), ins ufficient ( -), or inconsistent ( \u00b1) which were based on the results from developmental and content validity studies as well as reviewers rating. I f the developmental process for an outcome measure was not reported , then the overall rating was based only on the reviewer rating . Second, we assessed RoB for e ach measurement property in the validation studies and rated it as very good, adequate, doubtful , or inadequate . The overall rating per measurement property was determined by the lowest rating for each stan dard.1,2 The RoB assessment of response definitions was not undertaken as it is not part of the COSMIN RoB checklist. Furthermore, we applied quality criteria. E ach measurement property was rated as either sufficient (+), insufficient (-), or indeterminate (?) based on the predefined criteria for good measurement properties (GMP) .1 For construct validity and responsiveness, the review team formulated a priori hypotheses about the expected relationships betwe en an outcome measure and comparator instruments. Overall, 75% of the results were expected to meet the criteria to be classifie d as sufficient.1 Criteria for GMP are listed in Table S2 . Lastly, the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach .1,3,5 Quality of evidence was rated as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' for four factors (RoB, inconsistency, imprecision, and indirectness) for 'validity' studies while for 'developmental' studies rating was done according to three (RoB, inconsistency, and indirectness) by two reviewers (EK, AR). Papers describin g development of the outcome measure were eligible for inclusion regardless of severity of asthma but subsequently downgraded for indirectness. Only inconsistency, imprecision and indirectness were assessed for the definitions of response as per the COSMIN guideline.1 GRADE was not assessed in studies with indeterminate (?) rating based on GMP .1 Any disagreements were resolved through the consultation with a third reviewer (GR). A descriptive synopsis with summary data tables were produced, and results were summarized using narrative synthesis . Table S1. COSMIN definitions of domains, measurement properties, and aspects of measurement properties. Term Definition Domain Measurement Property Aspect of a Measurement Property Reliability The degree to which the measurement is free from measurement error Reliability (extended definition) The extent to which scores for patients who have not changed are the same for repeated measurement under several conditions: e .g. using different sets of items from the same health related -patient reported outcomes (HR - PRO; internal consistency); over time (test -retest); by different persons on the same occasion (inter -rater); or by the same persons (i .e. raters or responders) on different occasions (intra -rater) Internal consistency The degree of the interrelatedness among the items Reliability The proportion of the total variance in the measurements which is due to ''true'' differences between patients Measurement error The systematic and random error of a patient's score that is not attributed to true changes in the construct to be measured Validity The degree to which an HR -PRO instrument measures the construct(s) it purports to measure Content validity The degree to which the content of an HR -PRO instrument is an adequate reflection of the construct to be measured Face validity The degree to which (the items of) an HR -PRO instrument indeed looks as though it is an adequate reflection of the construct to be measured Construct validity The degree to which the scores of an HR-PRO instrument are consistent with hypotheses (for instance with regard to internal relationships, relationships to scores of other instruments, or differences between relevant groups) based on the assumption that the HR -PRO instrument validly measures the con struct to be measured Structural validity The degree to which the scores of an HR -PRO instrument are an adequate reflection of the dimensionality of the construct to be measured Hypotheses Idem construct validity testing Cross -cultural validity The degree to which the performance of the items on a translated or culturally adapted HR -PRO instrument are an adequate reflection of the performance of the items of the original version of the HR -PRO instrument Criterion validity The degree to which the scores of an HR -PRO instrument are an adequate reflection of a ''gold standard'' Responsiveness The ability of an HR -PRO instrument to detect change over time in the construct to be measured Responsiveness Idem responsiveness Interpretability Interpretability is the degree to which one can assign qualitative meaning \u2014that is, clinical or commonly understood connotations \u2014to an instrument's quantitative scores or change in scores.
