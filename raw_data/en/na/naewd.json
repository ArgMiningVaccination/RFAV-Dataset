And in the text below we explain why. First of all, a meditation mat is the ideal foundation for a comfortable and relaxed meditation. Whether you use it with or without meditation cushion, you are comfortable anyway. Because of the luxurious thickness of the material you are always nice and warm, even on a cold tile floor. A meditation mat is soft, but has sufficient firmness so that you can remain firmly in place throughout your meditation. With or without a meditation pillow, the softness of the material ensures that you will never again have sore or sleeping ankles. You do not want to be distracted by a wrong sitting position and all kinds of annoying aches and pains. The world is already full enough with all kinds of distractions and stimuli. A good reason to make your meditation as easy and comfortable as possible. What material is a meditation mat made of? The Love Generation meditation mat, or Zabuton is made according to the Zen tradition in Japan. They can be compared with the well-known Japanese futons. The outer cover of the meditation mat is made of a very strong quality cotton canvas. The cover has a zipper so you can easily wash it out as needed. The inner cushion of the meditation mat has an unbleached cotton cover and a rough cotton filling. This means that the meditation mat is filled with the seed fluff from the cotton plant, which has been processed into cotton wool layers. Because these layers are placed at right angles to each other and fixed at fixed points, you have a sturdy but resilient filling. And the inner sleeve keeps the filling in place. Can you also use a meditation mat for yoga? A meditation mat is not only great for meditation, but also great for yoga! For example, in the Yin Yoga videos by Sarah Powers you will see that these types of meditation mats are frequently used during Yin Yoga. But they are also ideal for Hatha, Restorative and other forms of yoga. The mats can be used flat during class, for example at Swan Pose. But more is possible: The Love Generation meditation mats are supplied with a sturdy carrying strap. With this you can also fold or roll up the mat and use it as a yoga pad or for under your legs or your back during the Savasana. The carrying strap also makes it very easy to take along and store the meditation mat. Create your own ideal meditation spot by combining the meditation mat with "}
