Narcotics What are Narcotics? Also known as \"opioids,\" the term \"narcotic\" comes from the Greek word for \"stupor\" and originally referred to a variety of substances that dulled the senses and relieved pain. Though some people still refer to all drugs as \"narcot- ics,\" today \"narcotic\" refers to opium, opium derivatives, and their semi-synthetic substitutes. A more current term for these drugs, with less uncertainty regarding its meaning, is \"opioid.\" Examples include the illicit drug heroin and pharmaceutical drugs like OxyContin\u00ae, Vicodin\u00ae, codeine, morphine, methadone The poppy papaver somniferum is the source for all natural opioids, whereas synthetic opioids are made entirely in a lab and include meperidine, fentanyl, and methadone. Semi-synthetic opioids are synthesized from naturally occurring opium products, such as morphine and codeine, and include heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone. Teens can obtain narcotics from friends, family members, medicine cabinets, pharmacies, nursing homes, hospitals, hospices, doctors, and the Internet. What are common street names? Street names for various narcotics/opioids include: Hillbilly Heroin, Lean or Purple Drank, OC, Ox, Oxy, Oxycotton, Sippin Syrup What are their forms? Narcotics/opioids come in various forms including: Tablets, capsules, skin patches, powder, chunks in varying colors (from white to shades of brown and black), liquid form for oral use and injection, syrups, suppositories, lollipops How are they abused? Narcotics/opioids can be swallowed, smoked, sniffed, or injected.proDUceD anD pUBLiSHeD BY Drug enforcement administration U.S. Department of Justice WWW.Dea.goVDrugs of Abuse DrUgS of aBUSe i 2011 EDITION: A DEA Resource Guide 5I.

U.S. Chemical Control The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) employs a multi-faceted approach to combat drug trafficking which includes enforcement, interdiction, and education. A lesser known approach which combines elements from all three of these facets is chemical control. Large quantities of chemicals are required to synthesize, extract, and purify most illicit drugs. The DEA has long recognized the need to monitor these chemicals as part of its overall drug control concerns regarding harmful side effects that phenylpropanolamine (PPA) can have, on November 6, 2000 the Food and Drug Administration invoked a voluntary withdrawal of over-the counter PPA products intended for human consumption. 30 DrUgS of aBUSe i 2011 EDITION: A DEA Resource Guide1. n-Acetylanthranilic Acid 2 40 40 2.

Poppy papaver somniferum, the source for all non-synthetic opioids40 DrUgS of aBUSe i 2011 EDITION: A DEA Resource GuideOpium WhA t is oPium? Opium is a highly addictive non-synthetic narcotic that is extracted from the poppy plant, Papaver somniferum. The opium poppy is the key source for many narcotics, including morphine, codeine, and heroin. WhA t is its oRiGin? The poppy plant, Papaver somniferum, is the source of opium. It was grown in the Mediterranean region as early as 5,000 B.C., and has since been cultivated in a number of countries throughout the world. The milky fluid that seeps from its incisions in the unripe seed pod of this poppy has been scraped by hand and air-dried to produce what is known as opium. A more modern method of harvesting for pharmaceutical use is by the industrial poppy straw process of extracting alkaloids from the mature dried plant (concentrate of poppy straw). All opium and poppy straw used for pharmaceutical products are imported into the United States from legiti- mate sources in regulated countries. What are common street names?

Domestic clandestine laboratory operators also produce and distribute meth but usually on a smaller scale. The methods used depend on the availability of precursor chemicals. Currently, meth is mainly made with diverted products that contain pseudoephedrine. The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 requires retailers of non-prescription products containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine to place these products behind the counter or in a locked cabinet.

Depressants will put you to sleep, relieve anxiety and muscle spasms, and prevent seizures. Barbiturates are older drugs and include butalbital (Fiorina\u00ae), phenobarbital, Pentothal\u00ae, Seconal\u00ae and Nembutal\u00ae. You can rapidly develop dependence on and tolerance to barbiturates, meaning you need more and more of them to feel and function normally. This makes them unsafe, increasing the likelihood of coma or death. Benzodiazepines were developed to replace barbiturates, though they still share many of the undesirable side effects. Some examples are Valium\u00ae, Xanax\u00ae, Halcion\u00ae, Ativan\u00ae, Klonopin\u00ae and Restoril\u00ae. Rohypnol\u00ae is a benzodiazepine that is not manufactured or legally marketed in the United States, but it is used illegally. Ambien\u00ae and Sonata\u00ae are sedative-hypnotic medications approved for the short-term treatment of insomnia that share many of the properties of benzodiazepines. Other CNS depressants include meprobamate, methaqualone (Quaalude\u00ae), drug GHB. WhA t is thEiR oRiGin? Generally, legitimate pharmaceutical products are diverted to the illicit market.

Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is another name for the generic drug sodium oxybate. Xyrem\u00ae (which is sodium oxybate) is the trade name of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription medication. Analogues that are often substituted for GHB include GBL (gamma butyrolactone) and 1,4 BD (also called just \"BD\"), which is 1,4-butanediol. These analogues are available legally as industrial solvents used to produce polyurethane, pesticides, elastic fibers, pharmaceuticals, coatings on metal or plastic, and other products. They are also are sold illicitly as supplements for bodybuilding, fat loss, reversal of baldness, improved eyesight, and to combat aging, depression, drug addiction, and insomnia. GBL and BD are sold as \"fish for approximately $100 per bottle \u2014 much more expensive than comparable products. Attempts to identify the abuse of GHB analogues are hampered by the fact that routine toxicological screens do not detect the presence of these analogues. WhA t is its oRiGin? GHB is produced illegally in both domestic and foreign clandestine laboratories. The major source of GHB on the street is through clandestine synthesis by local operators. At bars or \"rave\" parties, GHB is typically sold in liquid form by the capful or \"swig\" for $5 to $25 per cap. Xyrem \u00ae has the potential for diversion and abuse like any other pharmaceutical containing a controlled substance. GHB has been encountered in nearly every region of the country.

MDMA acts as both a stimulant and psychedelic, producing an energizing effect, distortions in time and perception, and enhanced enjoyment of tactile experiences. Adolescents and young adults use it to reduce inhibitions and to promote: \u00bb\u00bbEuphoria, feelings of closeness, empathy, and sexuality Although MDMA is known among users as Ecstasy, researchers have determined that many Ecstasy tablets contain not only MDMA but also a number of other drugs or drug combina- tions that can be harmful, such as: the over-the- counter cough suppressant dextromethorphan (DXM), the diet drug ephedrine, and caffeine In addition, other drugs similar to MDMA, such as MDA or PMA, are often sold as Ecstasy, which can lead to overdose and death when the user takes additional doses to obtain the desired effect. WhA t is its oRiGin? MDMA is a synthetic chemical made in labs.

It distorts perceptions of sight and sound and makes the user feel disconnected and not in control. It is an injectable, short-acting anesthetic for use in humans and animals. It is referred to as a \"dissociative anesthetic\" because it makes patients feel detached from their pain and environment. Ketamine can induce a state of sedation (feeling calm and relaxed), immobility, relief from pain, and amnesia (no memory of events while under the influence of the drug). It is abused for its ability to produce dissociative sensations and hallucinations. Ketamine has also been used to facilitate sexual assault. WhA t is its oRiGin? Ketamine is produced commercially in a number of countries, including the United States. Most of the ketamine illegally distributed in the United States is diverted or stolen from legitimate sources, particularly veterinary clinics, or smuggled into the United States from Mexico.
