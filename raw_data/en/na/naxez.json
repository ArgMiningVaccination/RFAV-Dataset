Are daily activities, errands and unfinished projects piling up and causing more stress than they should? To find balance, it is important to be proactive to relieve stress. In fact this may be just as important as getting more things done. Here are some tips with a holistic perspective to help relieve stress. BREATHE WITH AWARENESS Dedicate some time to intentionally focus on taking long, slow inhalations and exhalations. In fact, right now, just pause and take one full, deep breath in and then exhale slowly. Focusing on your breath can automatically help you to slow down, relax and start to destress. Deep breathing is a great tool because it is immediately accessible. You breathe all day long, whether you are thinking about it or not. Just a small shift in awareness can make a big difference in your ability to handle stress. ENJOY A CUP OF TEA Drinking a cup of caffeine-free tea can be a wonderful ritual for calming the nerves. Chamomile is one of my favorite types of tea for relaxation. Chamomile tea bags have a pleasant, mild flavor and they are readily available at health food and grocery stores. The flowers are fragile and should only be brewed in boiling water for one minute and then the tea bag should be removed. It can be served immediately or enjoyed as a cold beverage by adding ice cubes. For a little zing, add a squeeze of fresh lemon and a tiny bit of honey. If you are in the mood to try a naturally sweet and soothing beverage, here is a recipe for a vegetable broth made of the cooking water from boiled vegetables. Tranquility Tea Recipe 1 medium zucchini, sliced 1 carrot, peeled and sliced 2 tablespoons shelled peas 6 green beans, trimmed 4 cups water Add all ingredients to a saucepan, cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and let it simmer with the cover on for fifteen minutes. Let the mixture cool. Separate the solids from the liquid by pouring it through a strainer into a pitcher or storage jar. The boiled vegetables can be enjoyed as a side dish or mixed in with the liquid and eaten as a vegetable soup. This recipe yields 4 cups of tea, and can be enjoyed hot or cold. Excess can be stored in the refrigerator in a jar with tightly fitting lid and consumed within one day. KNOWING WHEN TO SEEK HELP Acupuncture is a form of holistic healthcare which addresses the body, mind and spirit. In Chinese Medicine we look at the relationship between the physical and energetic aspects of health, acknowledging the mind-body connection. Stress, tension and anxiety, can be directly related to blood pressure issues, low energy, food cravings, alcohol and nicotine addiction, digestive disorders, sleep disturbances and mood swings. These are viewed as issues which effect the flow of qi, or energy in the body. Acupuncture sessions are focused on improving the free-flow of qi throughout the energy pathways in the body, known as meridians. Tiny, disposable needles are used to move the qi, or energy along the meridians. When there is pain, stress or discomfort, there is a stagnation of qi. Free-flowing qi is a sign of good health in Chinese Medicine. Acupuncture can help balance the nervous system and promote deep relaxation. It may seem unusual to think of having tiny needles put in the body inducing a sense of calmness, but I see the results day after day when my clients report how relaxed they feel after their acupuncture sessions. There isn't one natural remedy that can make stress disappear, but try to incorporate some of these tips and see if you can make a difference one day at a time. Slow down, have a cup of tea, take a few deep breaths and remember to be grateful for the positive things in your life!
