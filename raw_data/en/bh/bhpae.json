In July, we heard that a new \"College of Medicine\" was to arise from its ashes. It seemed clear [from the people involved](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) that the name \"College of Medicine\" would be deceptive. Now the College of Medicine has materialised, and it is clear that one's worst fears were well justified. At first sight, it looks entirely plausible and well-meaning. Below the logo [one reads](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/about-college-medicine) \"There is a new force in medicine. A force that brings patients, doctors, nurses and other health professionals together, instead of separating them into tribes.\" \"That force is the new College of Medicine. Uniquely, it brings doctors and other health professionals together with patients and scientists.\" It is apparent from the outset that the well-meaning words fall into the trap described so clearly by James May (see [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095)). It fails to distinguish between curing and caring. As always, the clue lies not in the words, but in the people who are running it. Who is involved? After a bit of digging on the web site, you find the names of the people on the [Science Council of the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/science-council), The preamble says \"Good medicine must be grounded in good science as well as compassion. The College's Science Council brings a depth of knowledge from many senior figures.\" But then come the names. With the odd exception the \"science council\" is like a roll-call of quacks, the dregs left over from the Prince's Foundation. The link (attached to each name) gives the College's bio, My links tell a rather different story. - [Professor George Lewith](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-george-lewith)You'll find plenty about [George Lewith on this blog.](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22) - [Professor Mustafa Djamgoz](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-mustafa-djamgoz)Superficially respectable but seduced by 'ancient wisdom' He once wrote to me \"There are many 'eastern' remedies (such as acupuncture that we witnessed dismissed 25 year ago) that work. \".

There are a few gaps in this table, to be filled in soon. One can guarantee that a great deal more will appear about the College on the web, very soon. The [Governing Council of the College](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council) is equally replete with quacks (plus a few surprising names). It has on it, for example, a spiritual healer (Angie-Buxton King), a homeopath (Christine Glover), a herbalist (Michael McIntyre). Westminster University's king of woo (David Peters), not to mention the infamous [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Karol+Sikora%22). Buxton-King [offers a remarkable service](#abk1) to heal people or animals at a distance. Meanwhile, it seemed worthwhile to provide a warning that the title of the College is very deceptive. It hides an agenda that could do much harm. It is, quite simply, the Prince of Wales by stealth. Follow-up 28 October 2010 Professor Sir Graeme Catto, who has, disgracefully, allowed his name to be used as president of this \"College\" has said to me \"There are real problems in knowing how to care for folk with chronic conditions and the extent of the evidence base for medicine is pretty limited\". Yes of course that is quite true. There are many conditions for which medicine can still do little. There is a fascinating discussion to be had about how best to care for them. The answer to that is NOT to bring in spiritual healers and peddlers of sugar pills to deceive patients with their fairy stories. The \"College of Medicine\" will delay and pervert the sort of discussion that Catto says, rightly, is needed. 29 October 2010 I need a press card. I see that the BMJ also had a piece about the \"College of Medicine\" yesterday: [Prince's foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full), by Nigel Hawkes. He got the main point right there in the title. As was [clear since July](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), the driving force was Michael Dixon, Devon GP and ex medical director of the Prince's Foundation. Hawkes goes easy on the homeopaths and spiritual healers, but did spot something that I can't find on their web site. The \"Faculties\" will include \"in 2011, neuromusculoskeletal care. Two of the six strong faculty members for this specialty are from the British Chiropractic Association, which sued the author Simon Singh for libel for his disobliging remarks about the evidence base for their interventions.\" The College certainly picks its moment to endorse chiropractic, a subject that is in chaos and disgrace after they lost the Singh affair. One bit of good news emerges from Hawkes' piece, There is at least one high profile doubter in the medical establishment, Lord (John) Walton (his 2000 report on CAM was less than blunt, and has been widely misquoted by quacks) is reported as saying, at the opening ceremony \"I'm here as a sceptic, and I've just told my former houseman that,\" he said. The target of the remark was Donald Irvine, another former GMC president and a member of the new college's advisory council.\" 31 October 2010. I got an email that pointed out a remarkable service offered by a member of College's [Governing Council](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). Angie Buxton-King, a \"spiritual healer\" employed by UCLH seems to have another web site, [The Beacon of Healing Light](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/) that is not mentioned in [her biography](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/angie-buxton-king) on the College's site. Perhaps it should have been because it makes some remarkable claims. The [page about distant healing](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/Distant_Healing.php) is the most bizarre. Absent Healing/Distant Healing \"Absent healing is available when it is not possible to visit the patient or it is not possible for the patient to be brought to our healing room. This form of healing has proved to be very successful for humans and animals alike.\" \"We keep a healing book within our healing room and every night spend time sending healing to all those who have asked for it. We have found that if a picture of the patient is sent to us the healing is more beneficial, we also require a weekly update to monitor any progress or change in the patients situation. Donations are welcome for this service.\" I wonder what the Advertising Standards people make of the claim that it is \"very successful\"? I wonder what the president of the College makes of it? I've asked him. Other blogs about the \"College of Medicine\" 30 October 2010. Margaret McCartney is always worth reading. As a GP she is at the forefront of medicine. She's written about the College in [The Crisis in Caring and dangerous inference](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=801). She's also provided some information about a \"professional member\" of the [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/dr-sam-everington), in [..and on Dr Sam Everington, at the Bromley by Bow Centre....](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=803) It is one of the more insulting things about alternative medicine addicts that they claim to be the guardians of caring (as opposed to curing), They are not, and people like McCartney and Michael Baum are excellent examples. Prince of Wales to become honorary president of the \"College of Medicine?\" Last night I heard a rumour that the Prince of Wales is, despite all the earlier denials, to become Honorary President of the \"College\". If this is true, it completes the wholesale transformation of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Medicine into this new \"College\". Can anybody take it seriously now? Text messages to Graeme Catto and Michael Dixon, inviting them to deny the rumour, have met with silence. Herbal nonsense at the College 29 July 2011. I got an email from the College if Medicine [ [download it](http://www.dcscience.net/COM-Self-care.pdf)]. It contains a lot of fantasy about herbal medicines, sponsered by a company that manufactures them. It is dangeroous and corrupt. "}
