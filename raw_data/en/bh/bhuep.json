[Speaking in New York at the weekend](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2021/09/25/harry-meghan-meet-un-secretary-general-final-day-new-york-tour/), the Duke said: \"[Experts] said many countries are ready to produce vaccines back home, yet they aren't allowed to because ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies are not sharing the recipes to make them. \"These countries have the means, the abilities and the workers to start manufacturing. All they are waiting for is the vaccine intellectual property [IP] to be waived and the vaccine technology to be transferred over.\" However, while scientists agree that jabs should be [distributed worldwide](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/02/03/tunisia-palestinian-territories-receive-first-covid-vaccines/) as a priority, the majority also believe relinquishing IP is not a panacea. \"We agree with the Sussexes that action is needed now to ensure Covid-19 vaccines are quickly and [equitably shared around the world](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/global-initiative-get-vaccines-worlds-poorest-secures-2bn-doses/),\" Thomas Cueni, the director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, told The Telegraph. \"Waiving intellectual property rights of Covid-19 vaccines will not increase production nor provide practical solutions needed to battle this global health crisis. As we have consistently stated, a waiver is the simple, but wrong, answer to what is a complex problem. \"Since we now have billions of vaccines that have been produced and many more in the pipeline, calls for waiving IP is a distraction.\" Mr Cueni added that the real challenges are [trade barriers](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/another-blow-global-vaccine-rollout-india-looks-set-extend-export/), [supply chain bottlenecks](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/global-vaccine-scheme-unveils-country-by-country-plans-distribute/), a lack of raw materials, and a [reluctance among rich countries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/biden-urges-nations-go-big-ensure-70pc-world-vaccinated-within/) to share doses. The solution to the [vaccine apartheid](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/fears-vaccine-apartheid-countries-mull-immunisation-passports/) is political leadership, he says, as there are 1.2 billion spare doses between the UK, US, EU and Canada. \"These numbers are proof that the vaccine manufacturing scale-up is such that the issue is not scarcity of supply, the issue is redistribution,\" Mr Cueni said. Waiving IP 'won't resolve vaccine inequity' Dr Michael Head, the senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, added: \"The level of inequity in the vaccine rollout is unacceptable. A release of vaccine IP would be helpful, but it wouldn't in itself resolve the inequity. There are many variables that have contributed to this unsatisfactory situation.\" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: \"People often assume that there is a single patent behind each vaccine, there is not, there are multiple patents and they would all have to be opened. \"With the RNA vaccines in particular, I don't believe that there are many places in the developing world that could manufacture them "}
