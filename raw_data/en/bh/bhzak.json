However, some experts have raised concerns over the safety and efficacy of wellness supplements. If you have the question, \"What is Wellness Formula?,\" read to learn more about the supplement, wellness supplement safety, and how to support your immune system naturally. Dietary supplements are minimally regulated by the FDA and may or may not be suitable for you. The effects of supplements vary from person to person and depend on many variables, including type, dosage, frequency of use, and interactions with current medications. Please speak with a healthcare provider or pharmacist before starting any supplements. Claimed Benefits of Wellness Formula Wellness Formula is a dietary supplement made by Source Naturals, which claims to support the immune system by supplying high doses of vitamin C and more than 30 other vitamins, minerals, and herbs. Wellness Formula additionally claims to work \"deeply at the cellular level\" to strengthen the body's stress response and respiratory system. How To Take Wellness Formula Wellness Formula is available in capsule or tablet form. You can take four to six capsules daily, with up to six capsules every three hours. You may take three tablets daily or three tablets every three hours within 24 hours. What To Know About 'Immune-Boosting' Supplements Is Wellness Formula Safe? The Wellness Formula label suggests that the product is safe if a person does not take more than 24 capsules or 15 tablets daily for up to seven days. However, the label mentions that you should not take the product if you are pregnant, could become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Still, there are no clinical studies to support Wellness Formula's claims. Also, the FDA does not regulate wellness supplements; they only check a small percentage of dietary supplements annually. For those reasons, confirming the supposed wellness supplement benefits can be challenging. Also, Wellness Formula and other wellness supplements may interact with certain medications, and megadoses of certain nutrients can cause adverse side effects. Potential Interactions Some ingredients found in Wellness Formula may interact with other medications. One such ingredient is garlic. Consumption of garlic can increase the risk of bleeding for individuals who take anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs. Wellness Formula also has ingredients that may affect medical conditions or their symptoms. For instance, evidence has suggested that echinacea, a type of herb found in Wellness Formula, can exacerbate autoimmune diseases. Consult a healthcare provider before taking a new supplement. They can assess your health history and any medications you take that may interact with the new one. Supplements That Should Not Be Mixed What to Look For Look for a wellness supplement with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or NSF International (NSF) logos. These logos are associated with contaminant-free supplements and ones with a verified ingredient list. Keep in mind that those logos do not mean the product is effective. Can You Have Too Much of the Wellness Supplement? Wellness supplements, including Wellness Formula, market their products as containing high doses of immune-supporting nutrients like vitamins A, C, and D. In excess, those nutrients can cause adverse side effects. One six-capsule dose of Wellness Formula contains 1,300 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. Women should have 75mg of vitamin C daily, and men should have 90mg. The tolerable upper intake is 2,000 mg daily. One dose keeps you under the tolerable upper intake. Yet a second six-capsule dose puts you at 2,550mg or 128% of the upper intake, and three doses put you at 191%. Side effects of taking too much vitamin C may include: DiarrheaNauseaStomach cramps Some research has suggested that taking large, short-term vitamin C doses beyond the tolerable dose limit (e.g., 8,000mg) can be helpful for illnesses like the common cold. However, overall research about the link between vitamin C supplementation and symptom reduction for illnesses\u2014including COVID-19\u2014have been mixed and are ongoing. Likewise, Wellness Formula's zinc content can exceed the upper intake. The recommended daily amount is 8mg of zinc for women and 11mg for men. The tolerable upper intake is 40mg. Just one dose of Wellness Formula has 23mg of zinc. After two doses, you're at 115% of the upper intake level. Side effects of taking too much zinc include: NauseaVomitingFeeling dizzyHeadachesLoss of appetiteLimited taste and smell Can You Take Vitamin D and Calcium Together? Side Effects There aren't many reports regarding the side effects of Wellness Formula. However, it's possible to experience the effects of excessive vitamin C or zinc consumption. How To Support Your Immune System Many wellness supplements claim to protect against infections like the common cold, the flu, or COVID-19. Still, no supplement will definitively keep you from becoming ill. Instead, practicing proper handwashing and staying away from people who are sick will prevent the spread of germs. Other lifestyle changes can help support your immune system. For example, a balanced diet of fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help you meet the recommended daily intake of immune-supporting nutrients without exceeding the upper limit. Sources of immune-supporting nutrients include: Vitamin A: Leafy green vegetables, fresh fruit (e.g., cantaloupe, apricots, and mangos), and dairy productsVitamin C: Citrus fruits, red and green peppers, fresh fruit (e.g., kiwi, strawberries, and cantaloupe), broccoli, and baked potatoesVitamin D: Seafood, beef liver, and dairy products. You can also get vitamin D from safe sun exposure. Zinc: Seafood, red meat, dark meat poultry, high-fiber foods (e.g., beans, whole grains, and nuts), and dairy products In addition to eating a balanced diet, other lifestyle changes include: Regularly exercisingMaintaining a healthy body weightGetting a good night's sleep dailyQuitting smokingLimiting your alcohol intake 6 Things You Need to Know About Your Immune System A Quick Review Wellness supplements like Wellness Formula are marketed as easy, affordable ways to support immune health. No supplement can fully protect against infections like the common cold, the flu, and COVID-19. Some wellness supplements may pose risks due to their excessive doses of nutrients. Instead, to stay healthy, practice proper hygiene, maintain distance from people who are sick, eat a balanced diet, and exercise, among other lifestyle changes. Was this page helpful?
