Session 1D The Importance of Social Relationships in Providing Resiliency Among College Students During the COVID Pandemic Presenters: Greg Fulkerson, Ph.D.; James Zians, Ph.D.; Sallie Han, Ph.D. This presentation examines the interplay between individual-level social support and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic on two college campuses. Findings suggest that the most robust predictor of reduced psychological distress was individual social capital, which also served as an intermediary between the outbreak and distress. The ramifications for integrative mental and physical health will be discussed. Learning Objectives - Present findings of mental health among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic; - Present challenges facing mental health professionals working with college students during the COVID-19 pandemic; - Discuss the significance for integrated health services on college campuses in the future. Dr. Fulkerson is a Professor of Sociology, SUNY Oneonta; Dr. Zians is a Professor of Psychology, SUNY Oneonta; Dr. Han is a Professor of Anthropology, SUNY Oneonta; and Dr. McCarthy is a Professor of Data Science and Director of the Data Science Program at Utica University. Session 1E Because Science: Hearing and Dismissing the Diverse Voices of Vaccine Dissenters in the Context of COVID-19 Presenter: Laurah Klepinger, Ph.D. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. has witnessed division in opinion over public health measures including mask guidelines, business closures, and vaccinations. This presentation, based on ethnographic interviews, puts forth the voices of vaccine dissenters of a variety of identities, histories, and positions, including \"left-leaning parents,\" who may find themselves suddenly aligned with those on the right, as well as in contrast with marginalized populations whose health risks in the context of the pandemic have been disproportionately high. Learning Objectives - Highlight the diverse voices of vaccine dissenters, in order to have a better, more inclusive debate about ongoing public health measures in the U.S. response to COVID-19; - Bring to light the complex alternative and integrative health practices and beliefs of some members of the vaccine-dissenting population; - Reflect on vaccine-dissent discourses that tie into integrative and alternative health practices, in combination with other concerns, such as privilege and inequality in healthcare and a lack of cultural inclusiveness in biomedical models of public health. Dr. Klepinger is a cultural anthropologist and an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Utica University. Concurrent Session 2 Session 2A This Might Hurt Panel Discussion (continued); see Session 1A for description. Session 2B Spiritual Assessment Presenters: Daniel Kuckel, M.D., M.S., Jones, M.D.; and Dustin Smith, D.O., FAAFP The spiritual assessment offers the opportunity to enhance the patient-physician relationship and incorporate patient views that may have a significant impact on clinical decision-making. Multiple studies demonstrate that patients' expectations of spiritual discussions in the healthcare setting are not being met. Perceived barriers include lack of time, training, and experience, and there is a wide variety of physician approaches to spiritual care in the healthcare setting. This presentation will examine spiritual assessment that is patient-centered and intended to help with goals of care, as well as the significant relationship between spirituality and improved mental and physical health outcomes. Learning Objectives - Recognize evidence and assessment tools for eliciting patients' thoughts on spirituality; - Review evidence and assessment tools for eliciting patients' thoughts on spirituality; - Develop skills of empathetic listening and incorporating a patient's spiritual preferences into their treatment plan, as well as encouraging patients to use resources of their spiritual tradition to foster wellness.

Session 2C Can Reflexology Help to Bridge the Gap Between Eastern and Western Medicine? Presenter: William Anthony Mandour, M.D., C.R. Reflexology, or Acupressure is an Eastern Holistic modality that has existed for over 4,000 years. In theory, pressure applied to specific points on the tops and bottoms of the feet that correlate with bodily systems and organs is thought to stimulate these distant body sites via the nervous system to function more effectively and to bring these body systems into balance. Believers in Reflexology feel that it can improve a sense of overall well-being, as well as possibly improve symptoms of neurological, orthopedic and GI disorders. In addition, it is effective in relieving stress, anxiety, and sleep disorders. This presentation will focus on how Reflexology can work hand-in-hand with Western medicine to enhance the effects of conventional treatments in a complimentary fashion. Learning Objectives - Enlighten the audience as to what Reflexology actually is, the history of how it developed in India and China, and how it made its way to Western countries; - Demonstrate how Reflexology can be used in conjunction with Western medicine as a \"Complimentary\" modality; - Present possible conditions and illnesses where Reflexology may play a role in improving symptoms. Dr. Mandour is a board certified reflexologist in addition to being a board certified physician. Session 2D COVID Recession Economic Hot Spots (and Coldspots) Presenter: Michael McCarthy, Ph.D. The COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. created a recession in the second quarter of 2020. Communities throughout the U.S. experienced the recession's repercussions unevenly. Studies focused primarily on unemployment statistics, but missed other aspects of economic distress. This presentation looks at communities' economic variables to identify areas with the greatest economic distress resulting from the COVID-19 Recession. Hotspots and cold spots of economic distress were identified, which will help us better understand the uneven distribution of economic distress in the U.S. resulting from the COVID Recession. Learning Objective - Examine the economics of communities during the COVID Recession with particular focus on the Institute's second theme: \"the physical, social, and economic environments.\" Dr. McCarthy is Professor of Data Science and Director of the Data Science Program at Utica University. Session 2E Roundtable--Building Regional Resilience through Collaboration Moderator: Alexander Thomas, Ph.D. This round table discussion features researchers from the Intermountain Research Consortium, which captures the region between the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains, and includes faculty from SUNY Oneonta and Utica University.

We invite others into the dialogue to share interests, capacity, and resources that support our collective resilience. Junior faculty are especially welcome. Learning Objectives - Explore collaborative research opportunities; - Engage in exploratory dialogue about building local resilience; - Consider health-related issues from multiple perspectives. Dr. Thomas is a Professor of Sociology at SUNY Oneonta. Concurrent Session 3 Session 3A Children, Families, and Integrative Practices Presenters: Nicole Scienza, Ph.D. and Laurah Klepinger, Ph.D. Research indicates that engaging in activities such as mindfulness practices and yoga can reduce stress and promote emotional balance and well-being, which have a positive impact on overall health. The purpose of this presentation is to share an interdisciplinary project designed to understand how families with children in Central New York utilize integrative healthcare and how they communicate about their healthcare practices to healthcare and childcare providers. Presenters will share an initial survey of families in Central New York that assesses the range of healthcare practices utilized by families and the extent to which home practices are supported by families' formal healthcare. A brief introduction to plans for the creation of a curriculum to empower families to speak to healthcare provides and childcare providers about integrative healthcare practices will also be included. Learning Objectives - Understand the current literature on integrative healthcare practices used by families; - Examine how families in Oneida Country currently use integrative healthcare practices and if/how families share that information with their childcare providers and primary care physicians; - Introduce the proposed curriculum the presenters will use with families and childcare providers to educate based on the data collected. Dr. Scienza is an early childhood educator and is an Assistant Professor of Psychology Child Life at Utica University; Dr. Klepinger is a cultural anthropologist and is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Utica University. Session 3B Dancing with the Dimensions of Wellness Presenter: Gwendolyn Murphy, M.S., A.T.C., C.E.S. This presentation will discuss a basic history of dance, highlighting the importance of non-Eurocentric dance styles. Additionally, the biases and constraints that make dance seem inaccessible to the general population will be discussed. Focus will also be placed on the health benefits of dance and their alignment with the dimensions of wellness. Dance as a life-time activity, a means to facilitate physical literacy, and ways to make dance more accessible to the population will round-out the presentation.

Ms. Murphy is a formally-trained dancer with experience as an athletic trainer; she is currently an adjunct instructor of Physical Education, Exercise, and Wellness Studies at Utica University. Session 3C Mind-Body Interventions to Increase Stress Resiliency of Adult Trauma Survivors Presenter: Trista Richardson, M.S., OTR/L There is a high incidence of trauma present within the adult population and the multifaceted effects that trauma places on the body demonstrate the need to look for treatment approaches other than psychotherapy. Trauma can affect an individual physically, emotionally, mentally, socially, and spiritually. Cognitive behavioral therapy, psychiatric medications, and psychodynamic psychotherapy alone have difficulty integrating successful therapeutic practice with individuals experiencing trauma, as there is not a focus on introspection to assist in addressing awareness of internal sensations and physical activity patterns. The use of yoga as an intervention can assist with the regulation of emotional and physiological stress, bringing a somatic component to the deficit that cognitive behavior therapy alone has not been able to address. This presentation will focus on the positive implications of the mind-body interventions of yoga, therapeutic breathing, and guided meditation to assist in treating the symptoms of trauma. Learning Objectives - Explain the role that occupational therapy can have in addressing trauma; - Explore how mind-body interventions positively impact those with a history of trauma. Ms. Richardson is an occupational therapist and a certified yoga instructor; she is pursuing doctoral study at Utica University. Session 3D Panel Discussion--Data Drives Community Health and Healing: Healthcare Leaders Discuss HealthData4Action at the Community Level Moderators: Patrice Hallock, Ph.D. and John Milligan, F.A.C.H.E., F.H.F.M.A., C.P.A., CEO of Upstate Health Center - Anne Gadomski, M.D., M.P.H., Attending Pediatrician and Director, Bassett Research Institute - Heidi Bond, Public Health Director, Otsego County - Jeff Becker, M.B.A., Vice President, Portfolio Marketing at FinThrive - Anthony J. Picente, Jr., Oneida County Executive Showcase and listen to local health thought-leaders discuss three themes: the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 at the community level; the value to social determinants of health data in population health planning; and how data is key to designing next generation pubic health programs that support health and healing at the community level.

Concurrent Session 4 Session 4A Technology That Heals: The Influence of Neurofeedback in Behavioral Health Presenter: Christine Tyrrell Baker, Ph.D. Traditional approaches to mental health and addiction treatment rely primarily on verbal approaches to treatment, as well as medications. Neurofeedback is an innovative treatment that is complementary to more traditional approaches. Neurofeedback facilitates neuroplasticity through participating in a learning task to change default brain patterns that influence how people respond to their emotions and their self-awareness. Neurofeedback creates new patterns of activation in the prefrontal cortex. As such, individuals experience greater emotional resilience, better executive functioning, stronger self- agency, and greater openness to new information. This presentation will focus on the use of Neurofeedback in the treatment of mental health and addiction disorders. Learning Objectives - Understand what Neurofeedback is and how it is relevant to the treatment of mental health and addictive disorders; - Understand how people change with Neurofeedback and how it can facilitate the process of treatment; - Understand the status of scientific evidence for Neurofeedback and how practitioners can collect relevant clinical data to describe and validate their findings. Dr. Baker is a licensed clinical psychologist; she is associated with WellBeing CNY, Fayetteville, NY. Session 4B Better Health with Reiki and Forest Bathing Activities Presenter: Rebecca Austill-Clausen, M.S., OTR/L, FOTA Reiki, a biofield energy complementary health modality, is used by millions. Learn how Reiki can activate your own healing energy, and discover how Reiki training and treatment can be included in community healthcare programs, facilities, and self-care. Forest Bathing, called Shinrin-Yoku in Japan, brings peace, comfort, and decreased stress. Discover how to incorporate forest bathing techniques in your neighborhood and your communities' nature lands. Develop a unique plan of self-healing while bringing meaning and purpose into your life.

Ms. Austill-Clausen is an occupational therapist, Reiki Master, and accomplished Reiki instructor; she is the author of Change Maker, How My Brother's Death Woke Up My Life. Session 4C American Indian Traditional Ceremonial Practices as an Integrative Approach to Physical, Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual Healing Presenter: D'Shane Barnett, Ph.D. American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities grapple with the effects of historical trauma, including observed high rates of disease burden, mental illness, and problem substance use. Traditionally, AIAN communities held ecological knowledge that supported holistic wellness through a variety of medicines and ceremonies. Many of these practices were outlawed around 1883; however, with the passage of the American Indian Freedom of Religion Act in 1978, AIAN communities are finding ways to revitalize traditional ceremonial practices (TCPs). The holistic nature of TCPs allows for broad incorporation into medical, dental, and behavioral health services. However, healthcare administrators struggle to fund these interventions. This presentation will address how AIAN communities are integrating TCPs into healthcare. Learning Objectives - Describe in plain language the concept of American Indian historical and intergenerational trauma; - Describe in plain language the concept of American Indian traditional ceremonial practices (TCP); - Understand the integrative application of a least one TCP aimed at improving health in an American Indian population. Dr. Barnett (Mandan/Arikara) is the Director and Health Officer for the Missoula City-County Health Department, Missoula, Montana. Session 4D Immune Resilience, Mitigating Risk for Present/Future Viral and Microbial Challenges Presenter: Georgia Austin, B.S., M.S.A.C.N., C.N.S., C.C.N. We are exposed daily to millions of potential pathogens through contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Environmental factors, human factors, and man-made factors all influence their production. Immune resilience is the ability to mount an effective, innate, and adaptive response without causing excessive inflammation and undue harm to the body. Underlying conditions compromise the immune function and lead to a variety of conditions and diseases. Additionally, chronic stress suppresses or dysregulates immunity. A healthy lifestyle, including diet, serve as a mitigation strategy to support immune function and may help offset risk factors. This presentation will focus on strategies to boost the immune system through nutrition and lifestyle. Learning Objectives - Review the immune response to bacterial and viral challenges; - Identify the environmental and health stressors leading to impaired immune response, impaired immune resilience, and the connection to inflammasome activation; - Learn how to boost immune defense with targeted nutrition and lifestyle. Ms. Austin is a dual board-certified Clinical Nutritionist and is the owner of New Leaf Functional Nutrition, Manilus, NY.

Thank You Poster 1 Workplace Challenges Among Public Health Workers* Presenters: Emily Lasher, B.S.; Anne Ph.D. In September 2021, researchers from the Intermountain COVID-19 Impact Consortium and New York State Association of County Health Officials surveyed local public health workers in NYS to measure the level and identify the causes of psychological distress as they responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were asked about their experiences, including questions relating to harassment from the public, workload, work/life balance, etc. Understanding public health workers' challenges during the pandemic is critical to inform the actions we must take--stronger state laws protecting against harassment, workforce incentives, and commensurate funding\u2014to reinforce and revitalize our frontline public health workforce. This poster presentation will explore the significance of these findings for person-centered public health in the future. Learning Objectives - Identify challenges facing NYS public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic; - Describe mechanisms for improving the mental health of public health practitioners; - Reflect upon the significance of integrated public health practice in the future. Poster 2 Stress and Distress Among Child Care Workers in Eastern New York*** Presenters: Kristen Kemmerer, Ph.D.; Nicole Scienza, Ph.D.; and Alexander Ph.D. Researchers from the Intermountain COVID-19 Impact Consortium (ICIC) and the Mohawk Valley Economic Development District (MVEDD) administered a modified version of the Knowledge, Attitudes, Beliefs, and Behaviors (KABB) survey to understand the experiences of child care providers and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the survey indicated high levels of distress on both child care providers and families with children in care. This poster presentation explores the significance of these findings for person-centered public health in the future. Learning Objectives - Present challenges child care providers faced during the COVID-19 pandemic; - Present challenges families with children faced during the COVID-19 pandemic; - Discuss the significance for integrated health services in child care centers in the future. Poster 3 The Impact of Lighting on Healthcare Professionals: A Scoping Review*** Presenters: and Audrey Cross, M.S. The built environment of health care facilities is increasingly considered in regards to the health of those working within them. A holistic approach to health requires considering the influence of the work environment upon health and well-being. The WELL v2 Building Standard is an evidence-based strategy for designing built environments that foster human health and well-being. Light is one of the ten concepts covered in WELL building design. The goal of this WELL concept is to minimize the impact of light on circadian rhythm, and to improve energy, mood, productivity, visual health, and mental well-being. The researchers are currently conducting a scoping review that examines the impact of light upon healthcare personnel. This poster presentation will focus on this research and current findings. Learning Objectives - Describe the impact of light on healthcare professionals; - Summarize the current state of evidence regarding WELL v2 Building Standard lighting features in healthcare settings; - Justify the importance of the WELL v2 Building Standard regarding lighting and healthcare workers. Poster 4 Interprofessional Collaboration in Integrative Health Research: Errico, and Audrey Cross, M.S. Currently, there is a collaborative effort in healthcare to promote integration of interprofessional skills into health professions curricula. Likewise, there has been increased attention to faculty development in this area and a demand for interprofessional healthcare research. Much of the interprofessional research to date has consisted primarily of traditional healthcare professions. However, there is a call to include integrative healthcare professionals such as chiropractors and non-healthcare professionals, such as architects, librarians, environmental scientists, and lawyers in interprofessional research teams. The need to collaborate with such a diverse group has been identified to help deliver the highest quality of care. This case report describes the formation of a unique interprofessional research team composed of physical therapy and construction management faculty who are exploring an integrative health concept through their research, including the IPEC Core Competencies. This poster presentation will address strategies for working on interprofessional research teams and the need for additional interprofessional research on integrative health topics. Learning Objectives - Describe the four IPED Core Competencies; - Identify strategies for interprofessional research collaboration; - Justify the importance on interprofessional research on integrative health topics. Poster 5 The Association Between Nut Consumption and Risk of Gastrointestinal Cancers: A Systematic Review*** Presenter: Katie Hertline, student at Utica University, Nutrition and Dietetics major Increasing research studying the association between nut consumption and its effects on cancer has been seen in the scientific community. This study was designed to put together the results of previous studies on the association between nut consumption and gastrointestinal cancer. The systematic review included some 41 previous studies. This poster presentation will focus on the systematic review methods, as well as conclusions regarding association between nut consumption and gastrointestinal cancer. Learning Objective - Evaluation the associations between nut consumption and the risk of gastrointestinal cancer. Poster 6 Tracing Fecal Contamination and Antimicrobial Resistance in Rivers to Link Environmental Science, Community Health, and Public Policy*** Presenter: Julian Damashek, Ph.D. Antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health crisis. Resistant infections lead to increased rates of mortality and are costly to treat. The environment, including \"surface waters\" (such as streams, rivers, and lakes), play an important role in the evolution and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). When studied in tandem, spikes in resistant clinical infections are often preceded by increased ARG abundance in nearby environments. Aquatic ARBs come from both \"urban\" and \"rural\" sources, including sewage and agricultural runoff. This study focused on the abundance of a variety of ARGs and to trace markers of fecal contamination from numerous species in San Francisco Bay. This poster presentation will address the question of whether surface water fecal contamination is linked to clinical resistance in cities with aging sewer and water treatment infrastructure, such as most municipalities in the Mohawk and Hudson River valleys. Implications for public health will also be addressed. Learning Objectives - Trace sources of fecal contamination to surface waters; - Quantify sources of antimicrobial resistance genes to the environment; - Relate environmental pollution to infrastructure needs and public health. Poster 7 Research Design: Can a Bio-Electric Charge be Measured at Acupuncture Points Explaining the De Qi Sensation?** Presenter: Mackay Rippey, L.Ac., M.Ac. The acupuncture De Qi sensation is the sensation felt by patients when the Qi Energy \"arrives\" during needling. Many practitioners consider De Qi a sign of successful acupuncture needling. The nature of the sensation is distinct from the acupuncture needle penetrating skin and can be described as \"distended,\" \"sore,\" or \"numb.\" Researchers attempting to identify the source of De Qi have investigated bio-mechanical, bio-electrical, and neurological mechanisms. Acupuncture points have less electrical resistance than surrounding skin; however, there is little research investigating if there is an electrical potential associated with the points. This poster presentation will explore the release of an electric charge by the acupuncture needle and how it might explain the De Qi sensation felt by patients during an acupuncture treatment. Learning Objectives - Introduce the acupuncture concept of De Qi; - Inspire curiosity about acupuncture; - Contribute possible avenues of investigation about the physiological mechanisms of acupuncture. *These poster presentations will be presented virtually. **These poster presentations will be presented in-person at the conference. ***These poster presentations will be presented virtually and in-person at the conference.
