Whether you're a self-proclaimed gym-rat, a casual runner, a professional body-builder, or anything in between, you already know \u2014 most muscle-builders come with a lot of bad news. A recent survey by the Council of Responsible Nutrition revealed that [one in every five](https://www.crnusa.org/resources/2017-crn-consumer-survey-dietary-supplements) Americans takes sports nutrition supplements, many of which are designed to increase muscle mass. Unfortunately, nearly all of the accepted muscle-building substances currently on the market come with many unwanted side effects, such as mood swings and hormonal imbalances. Men need natural supplements for muscle growth that are safe and natural. Deer antler velvet has emerged as one of the most popular options to help encourage natural muscle growth. Here's why it's gaining popularity as a natural supplement for muscle growth. The Benefits of Gaining Muscle Naturally Gaining muscle mass naturally is the best route, every time. While the quick-fix promises of pharmaceuticals and illegal sound great, a natural supplement for muscle growth provides the same benefits, but with none of the risks. Some benefits of natural muscle growth include: Physical Appearance A lot of men are conscious of their appearance and their health. Building muscle is a way to tone the body, improve their appearance, and increase confidence. Unlike steroids and other drugs, natural supplements for muscle growth, like deer antler velvet, will tone your muscles naturally. This offers an increase in tone and size, without any exaggerated bulging. You'll look more natural and be far more healthy. Improved Physical Performance Bigger, leaner muscles result in improved athleticism. This translates to better performance on the field, gym or court. It's no wonder athletes are always working on building muscle, then, right? Natural muscle growth allows your body to develop its innate capabilities, improving agility, reflexes, and other physiological skills. Avoid Dangerous Side-Effects Perhaps the best part about natural muscle growth is that you'll avoid the negative side effects that come hand-in-hand with synthetic muscle growth drugs. From genital shrinkage to psychosis and even addiction problems, drugs such as anabolic steroids will do far more harm than good. Building your muscles through a balanced diet, regular exercise, and natural supplements can deliver great results without putting you at risk. It's More Than the Supplement, Though! Finding the best natural bodybuilding supplements may take time, but it's definitely the healthier alternative. Besides a balanced combination of nutrients, muscle growth also requires regular exercise and a wholesome diet. What is Deer Antler Velvet? Deer and other cervine animals are best known for their beautiful antlers. But what you probably didn't know is that if harvested at the right time, cervine horns can be used to produce a versatile supplement known as deer antler velvet. While deer antler velvet is new to the Western culture, it has been a critical ingredient in [Eastern medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874112008306) for more than two centuries. Antler velvet can be harvested from deer, caribou, moose, or elk. To be effective, the antlers need to be in the pre-calcified stage of growth. In other words, they should be covered in a fuzzy layer that gives the supplement its name. The velvet offers trace elements, minerals, lipids, hormones, growth-stimulating protein, and other nutrients that promote natural muscle growth. Note: It's worth noting that the FDA recognized deer antler velvet as a safe dietary supplement in the late 1990s. The FDA has not endorsed its use as a muscle-building supplement or to treat any kind of condition. Can You Use Deer Antler Velvet to Stimulate Muscle Growth? Deer antler velvet is full of essential nutrients that may encourage muscular development.For example, deer antler velvet can increase testosterone levels. [Testosterone](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686330/#__sec19title) is one of the most important chemicals in your body and it plays a vital role in the development of larger muscles. Research also shows that antler velvet supplements contain high levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 or IGF-1. This compound signals the body and tells it to produce lean muscle, so it [literally encourages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4955189/#sec1-5title) your body to get stronger through its natural processes. Muscle Mass Besides testosterone, high levels of IGF-1 also tell your body to produce growth hormone (GH) which [increases muscle density](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jappl.1998.84.5.1716?cookieSet=1) and the production rate of muscle cells. At a molecular level, it's believed that GH promotes protein synthesis by creating a network of satellite cells, which eventually develop into skeletal muscle. This has proven to be so successful that, even if it has not been established as an official muscle-building supplement, antler spray is already banned by the major sports leagues in the US. Aches and Pains Traditional Chinese medicine texts list deer antler velvet as a powerful analgesic and anti-inflammatory. The compound is available in pills, tinctures, powder, sprays, and more. The ability to reduce pain and swelling has made it particularly helpful for support following heavy workouts. Energy and Healing According to many users, deer antler velvet supplements also offers a long-lasting energy boost. Instead of providing short bursts of \"superficial\" energy like caffeine, antler spray steadily increases overall energy. This is believed to have a gradual \"healing\" effect on the body. Joint Strength and Flexibility Joint pains are inevitable with old age, especially if you have spent much of your life working out regularly, whether on the job or in the gym. Deer antler velvet is made of protein-rich cartilage that may potentially rejuvenate joints. For many, the extract helps to support and restore their natural strength and flexibility.
