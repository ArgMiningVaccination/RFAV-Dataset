The session was attended by representatives of the following Members of the Executive Committee elected by the Directing Counc il: Bolivia, Canada, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Honduras, Peru, Jamaica, and Uruguay. El Salvador, the ninth Member of the Committee, was not represented. Also present in an observer capacity were representatives of the following other Memb er States and Associate Member: Cuba, Panama, Puerto Rico, and United States of America. Dr. Carlos Dotres Mart\u00ednez (Cuba, Pres ident of the Executive Committee at its 127 th and 128th Sessions) opened the session and welcomed the participants, extending a special welcome to the new members of the Committee just elected by the 43rd Directing Council: Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Peru.

O. Alleyne, Director of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (PASB), served as Secretary ex officio, and Dr. Da vid Brandling-Bennett, Deputy Director of PASB, served as Technical Secretary. Adoption of the Agenda (Document CE129/1) Pursuant to Rule 9 of its Rules of Procedure, the Committee adopted the provisional agenda prepared by the Secretariat (Decision CE129(D1)). CE129/FR (Eng.) Page 5 Committee Matters Election of One Member State to the Subcommittee on Planning and Programming Honduras was elected to serve on the Subcommittee on Planning and Programming on the expiration of the peri od of office of Cuba on the Executive Committee (Decision CE129(D2)). Election of One Member State to the Standing Committee on Nongovernmental Organizations Peru was elected to serve on th e Standing Committee on Nongovernmental Organizations on the expiration of the peri od of office of Nicaragua on the Executive Committee (Decision CE129(D3)). Governing Body Matters Dates and Proposed Topics for the 36th Session of the Subcommittee on Planning and Programming The Committee decided that the 36th Session of the Subcommittee on Planning and Programming (SPP) would be held on 25-27 March 2002. The Director proposed that the following topics be examined at that session: Evaluation of the strategic and programmatic orientations (SPOs) for the Organization for the period 1999-2002, progress report on the st rategic plan for PAHO for the period 2003-2007, integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), social protection in health, national health accounts, and maternal mortality and morbidity. Members of the Committee proposed severa l additional topics for consideration during the 36th Session of the SPP, namely: community health workers, the public health response to chronic diseases, health of indi genous peoples, health and aging, and health in the Americas in the next century, focusi ng especially on the health challenges facing the Region in the next two decades. In conn ection with the evalua tion of the SPOs for 1999-2002, it was suggested that the Subcommitt ee should undertake a critical analysis of the Pan American Centers, including their role in the Organization, their administration and financing, and how they mi ght function more effectively. It was also pointed out that the 43rd Directing Council had approved the recommendation of the Subcommittee on Women, Health, and Developmen t to include the subject of \"gender, women, health, and development\" on the agendas of the Governing Bodies in 2002. Accordingly, the Committee recommended that that topic be placed on the Subcommittee's agenda. CE129/FR (Eng.) Page 6 In the documents to be prepared on all agenda items, the Secretariat was asked to include information regarding the impact of the subject area on marginalized populations (particularly children, women, and indi genous groups) and budget considerations (specifically, the budget allocation for the subject area in question). In relation to the matter of vaccines a nd immunization, to be discussed at the Executive Committee's 130 th Session in June 2002, the Dele gate of Canada suggested that the document should examine the issue of preparedness for the next influenza pandemic and said that his Government w ould be pleased to collaborate in providing information for the document. The Director said that every effort would be made to incorporate all of the agenda items proposed by Members into the Subcomm ittee's agenda, though some might have to be deferred to the next session. The Secr etariat would seek to involve Member Governments in drawing up some of the docum ents, as had been done quite successfully in the past, and would ensure that the documen ts were distributed well in advance of the session. The Committee agreed that the Secretar iat would draw up the agenda for the 36 th Session of the SPP, bearing in mind the topics proposed by Members. The Committee adopted Decision CE129(D4) on this item. Dates of the 130 th Session of the Executive Committee The Committee decided to hold its 130th Session on 24-28 June 2002 (Decision CE129(D5)). Dates of the 26 th Pan American Sanitary Conference, 54th Session of the Regional Committee of WHO for the Americas The Committee decided that the 26th Pan American Sanitary Conference would be held on 23-27 September 2002 (Decision CE129(D6)). Other Matters In light of the 43 rd Directing Council's recent discussion of the process for electing the Director of PASB, the Committ ee discussed the possibility of creating a forum in which candidates to the director ship could present their vision for the CE129/FR (Eng.) Page 7 Organization. It was suggested that a forum for that purpose might be held as a part of the Committee's next regular session in June 2002. It was also proposed that, for the benefit of countries that might not be able to send a representative to the session, written questions could be solicited in advance and videotapes of the proceedings could be provided. One Member of the Executive Committ ee, as well as some observers, spoke in favor of having the candidates make pres entations during the Executive Committee's 130 th session. However, other Members pointed out that the Directing Council had not formally endorsed the proposal of having a fo rum to allow candidates to present their platforms, and they expressed strong opposition to any change in the current electoral process. Those Members maintained that it would be inappropriate to utilize the resources of the Organization and the time of the Governing Bodies for discussion of electoral platforms; rather, it should be th e responsibility of individual candidates\u2014with the support of the countries that had propos ed their candidacy\u2014to make their positions known through such means as distribution of written materials and visits to countries throughout the Region. The Director said that he had intended to make a proposal to the Subcommittee on Planning and Programming as to how it mi ght be possible to create a forum for presentations by candidates within the norma l framework of the Executive Committee; however, in light of the discussion, he woul d not wish to do so now, unless there was clear consensus within the Committee that such a forum should exist. To bring some finality to the matter, the President proposed that the Committee vote on a motion put forward by Jamaica, namely, that the electoral process, as described in Article 21 of the PAHO Constitution and Ru le 56 of the Rules of Procedure of the Conference, should remain unchanged and th at candidates should not make a formal presentation of their programs to any sessi on of the Governing Bodies prior to the election. By a vote of seven votes in favor to one against, the Committee approved the motion (Decision CE129(D7)). Closing of the Session The President thanked the delegates for their participation and declared the 129 th Session closed. CE129/FR (Eng.)

Noting that the agenda was a rather full one, the Executive Committee made two suggestions that might lighten the workload: fi rst, that delegations might circulate written reports on the progress and achievements of th eir countries in the various program areas, rather than speaking about them, and, second, that subregional groupings such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) or the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) might consider developi ng regional positions and choosing one spokesperson to make a statement on be half of all their member countries. In response to a suggestion that an item dealing with the Centennial events and celebrations be added, the Direct or said that he would ensure that his own report included thorough information on the subject. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 8 The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R18, approving the provisional agenda, as revised. Committee and Subcommittee Matters Report of the Subcommittee on Planning and Programming (Document CE130/5) The report on the 36 th Session of the Subcommittee on Planning and Programming (SPP) was presented by Dr. Fran cisco L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n, in representation of the Government of El Salvador, which was el ected President of the Subcommittee at the 36th Session. That session was held at PAHO Headquarters on 25 and 26 March 2002. The Subcommittee discussed the following items which were also on the agenda of the Executive Committee at the 130th Session: Evaluation of the Strategic and Programmatic Orientations, 1999-2002; Stra tegic Plan for the Pan Am erican Sanitary Bureau, 2003-2007; Integrated Management of Childhood Illness; Extension of Social Protection in Health: Joint Initiative of the Pan Ameri can Health Organization and the International Labour Organization; Health and Aging; Regi onal Strategy for Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Reduction; Women, Health, and Deve lopment; and Public Health Response to Chronic Diseases. The Subcommittee's comments and recommendations on those items were taken into account in revising the documents for the Executive Committee and are reflected in the presentations and discussion of the respective agenda items in the present report. The Subcommittee also discussed an ite m concerning the Pan American Centers; however, rather than forward that item to the Executive Committee, the Subcommittee recommended that the Committee focus on th e evaluation of a single center\u2014the Pan American Center for Sanitary Engineeri ng and Environmental Sciences (CEPIS). Summaries of the presentations and di scussions on all the above-mentioned items may be found in the final report of the Subcommittee's 36 th Session (Document SPP36/FR). In the discussion that followed Dr. L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n's report, the need to clarify the role of the Pan American centers vis-\u00e0-vi s the countries\u2014especially in the area of research\u2014was highlighted. It was emphasized that the regional centers should not duplicate the efforts of national research centers but should complement and help enhance their research capacity. The Director thanked Dr. L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n for his service as President of the SPP and expressed his appreciation to the Members of the Subcommittee for their CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 9 contributions, which had been very useful to the Secretariat in preparing the documents for the Executive Committee. The Committee took note of the report a nd thanked the Subcommittee for its work (Decision CE130(D3)). Report of the Award Committee of the PAHO Award for Administration, 2002 (Documents CE130/6 and CE130/6, Add. I) Dr. Manuel Sandoval Lupiae (Honduras) report ed that representatives of Canada, Honduras, and Uruguay, the Members of the Award Committee of the PAHO Award for Administration, 2002, had met on Wednesday, 26 June 2002. After examining the documentation on the candidates nominated by the Member States, the Committee had decided to confer the award on Dr. Hugo Mendoza, of the Dominican Republic, for his pioneering efforts in public health resear ch and his valuable contribution to the improvement of maternal and child health in his country through the introduction of the public health approach in pe diatric care and teaching. The Delegate of the Dominican Republic expressed his countr y's appreciation for the award to Dr. Mendoza, a great professi onal who had dedicated his life to health services and a distinguished university professo r with many published wo rks to his credit. The Committee adopte d Resolution CE130.R16. Report of the Standing Committee on Nong overnmental Organizations in Official Relations with PAHO (Documen ts CE130/7 C\u00e1rdenas (Peru) pres ented the report of the Standing Committee on Nongovernmental Organizations. The St anding Committee, composed of the representatives of Bolivia, Jamaica, and Peru, had met on Tuesday, 25 June 2002, to consider a background paper prepared by the PAHO Secretariat containing the application of the InterAmerican Heart Foundati on (IAHF) for entry into official relations with PAHO, including a profile of the app licant and a history of its collaborative activities with PAHO. Afte r carefully reviewing the background documentation, the Standing Committee recommended to the Execu tive Committee that it admit the IAHF into official relations with PAHO. At the same meeting, the Standing Co mmittee had considered applications for continued official relations from four nongovernmental organizations: International Organization of Consumers Un ions (CI-ROLAC); Latin Am erican Confederation of Clinical Biochemistry (COLABIOCLI); Latin American Union Against Sexually Transmitted Diseases (ULACETS); and Natio nal Coalition of Hispanic Health and CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 10 Human Services Organizations (renamed the National Alliance for Hispanic Health). After a brief presentation by the resp ective NGOs and comments from the PAHO Secretariat, and in light of the written in formation provided on collaborative activities between each of the following NGOs and P AHO, the Standing Committee recommended to the Executive Committee that it authorize continuation of official relations with the Latin American Confederation of Clini cal Biochemistry (COLABIOCLI) and the National Alliance for Hispanic Health for a period of four years. Concerning the Interna tional Organization of Cons umers Unions (CI-ROLAC) and the Latin American Union Against Sexua lly Transmitted Diseases (ULACETS), the Standing Committee recommended to the Execu tive Committee that it review the status of official relations betw een PAHO and CI-ROLAC and ULACETS again the following year in order to give them the opportunity to implement the collabora tive work plans and clearly identify the technical areas that w ould best benefit from a collaborative effort. The Representative of the Latin American Confederation of Clinical Biochemistry (COLABIOCLI) expressed her appreciation for the continuation of official relations, describing it as a vote of confidence by the Executive Committee in her organization's commitment and professionalism. She also ex pressed appreciation for the support offered to COLABIOCLI by PAHO, both at Headqua rters and in the Dominican Republic. The Committee adopted Reso lution CE130.R17 on this item. Program Policy Matters Provisional Draft of the Program Budget of the World Health Organization for the Region of the Americas for the Fi nancial Period 2004-2005 (Document CE130/8) Mr. Rom\u00e1n Sotela (Chief of Budget, PA HO) presented the provi sional draft of the program budget. He explained that the present year, the first year of the biennium, was the time when the Executive Committee was asked to consider the WHO portion of the PAHO regular budget. The planning alloca tions for the 2004-2005 biennium had been given by the Director-General in March/April 2002, and at the present time the different Regions were requested to info rm WHO Headquarters as to how they planned to allocate the funds. The provisional draft of the program budge t was thus a partia l funding picture, representing only 29% of the PAHO/WHO regul ar budget. Consequently, the figures in document CE130/8 were not necessarily indicat ive of PAHO's level of commitment in any given technical area. The whole picture would become evident only when the PAHO CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 11 portion of the budget was added, and when the b udget as a whole was co nsidered in June 2003. The planning allocation issued by the Director-General to PAHO for 2004-2005 was US$72,491,000, representing a reduction of $2,191,000, or 2.9%, relative to the 2002-2003 allocation of $74,682,000. The reduction had been applied evenly in the two main portions of the budget, the Regiona l Office and Intercountry Programs and the Country Programs, in accordance with the instructions from WHO. The 2004-2005 period was the third consecutive biennium in which the Region of the Americas had seen a reduction in its planning allocation from WHO. Cumulatively, the reduction amounted to $10,195,000. The pr ogressive reductions arose from Resolution WHA51.31 approved by the Worl d Health Assembly in May 1998. An evaluation of the effects of the reductions was scheduled for the Fifty-seventh World Health Assembly in May 2004. Annex 1 of document CE130/8 show ed how the amount of $72,491,000 was divided up over the program cl assifications of WHO. The distribution complied with WHO instructions to make an overall shift equivalent to 2% to 3% of the budget to the WHO priority areas of work for 2004-2005. In the discussion that followed, delega tes raised a number of questions, in particular as to the criteria by which the funds were allocated to th e various areas. It was pointed out that the doc ument did not seem to show a shif t of 2% to 3% for all eleven priority areas of work id entified by WHO for the peri od 2004-2005. Noting that the draft program budget showed reductions in some pr ograms and increases in others and that perhaps the changes were not always consistent with the priorities for the Region (e.g., an increase to 11.5% in \"Evidence and informa tion for policy,\" or a decrease to 8.5% in \"Communicable diseases\"), several delegates asked the Secretariat to comment on that distribution. It was suggested that there was a need to analyze how the reductions relative to the previous biennium's budget had been dist ributed, and also how the deficit resulting from the reductions would be resolved. So me delegates felt that it would not be appropriate to approve an increase in country quotas to cover that deficit. One delegate proposed that PAHO might app eal to WHO, emphasizing that the regional allocation was not sufficient to enable it to carry out its programs. The Delegate of the United States of Am erica said that her country had supported the WHO regional reallocation and noted that the Americas had been the only one of the Note: Unless otherwise indicated, all currency figures in this report are expressed in United States dollars. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 12 four regions with decreased allocations that had been ab le to soften the blow by increasing its own budget. As PAHO began the process of making decisions for the next budget cycle, she trusted that th e collective concerns of all its Member States would be taken into consideration. The policy of the United States had not changed; it continued to advocate zero nominal growth in the budget. Her delegation theref ore hoped that PAHO would make the necessary adjustments, continue to seek increased efficiencies, and give active consideration to the availabili ty of extrabudgetary resources. In reply, Mr. Sotela stressed that it was misleading to look only at a part of the picture and try to deduce from it the priori ties of PAHO. The provisional draft of the program budget, representing only 29% of PAHO's total budget, could not be used to conclude that any particular item was more or less of a priority for PAHO. Soon, PAHO would start planning for the whole peri od 2004-2005, and by December it would have received all of the proposals prepared by th e PAHO representatives in the coun tries in consultation with the governments. At that tim e, the priorities of the Organization and its Member States would become evident. Regarding the distribution of funds to the priority areas of wor k, he explained that the 2%-3% shift would not ne cessarily be seen in ever y individual category. The instructions from WHO were that a shift of 2%-3% in aggregate was to be made. PAHO had done its best to implement the shift and to cover as many areas as possible, but the WHO priority areas would not necess arily all go up by the same amount. The Director reiterated that the prov isional draft program budget showed only a part of the picture. PAHO made its best effort to follow the instructions from WHO as to where the shifts were to take place. Howe ver, as the Director-General herself often pointed out, it was not possible to do that in a simple, mechanical way. For example, the problem of malaria was graver in Africa than in the Americas, and consequently the shift in that area would no doubt be greater in that Region. Once the whole picture was put together, then the extent to which PAHO had tried to follow the WHO priorities\u2014most of which had been accepted by PAHO's Governi ng Bodies as being relevant to PAHO as well\u2014would become evident. The reduced allocations were a reality with which PAHO had to come to terms, as nothing could be done to change them for the present. What was important was for PAHO to be very vigilant when the whole question of the distribut ion of resources was reexamined in 2004 and to ensure that the resu lt of those deliberati ons was equitable in terms of the world as a whole. He acknowledged that the Region of the Am ericas had so far been very fortunate in mobilizing extrabudgetary resources. If the representatives of the Member States CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 13 continued knocking on the appropriate doors, it was to be hoped that ultimately there would be a budget sufficient to carry out the programs of the Organization. The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R2 on this item. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AID S) in the Americas (Documents CE130/9 and CE130/9, Add. I) Dr. Fernando Zacar\u00edas (Coordinator, Program on Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/Sexually Transmitted Infections, PAHO) summarized the current figures on HIV/AIDS in the Americas and elsewhere. The epidemic was now present in all countries on all continents. Worldwide, an estimated 40 million adults and children were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2001. In th e Americas, the figure was 2.8 million. The situation was especially serious in the Cari bbean, where in some countries and population groups the prevalence of HIV infection was as high as 8%. The number of reported AIDS cases in the Region stood at 1.2 million. In addition, an estimated 40 million cases of other sexually transmitted infecti ons (STIs) occurred each year. Document CE130/9 presented a brief overv iew of the progress to date in the Region with regard to promotion of sexual health, communication, blood safety, interventions targeting injection drug users, reduction of mother-to-child transmission, and application of the Orga nization's \"Building Blocks\" model of comprehensive care for people living with HIV/AIDS and their families and caregivers. Accelerating Access to Antiretroviral (ARV) Drugs, a recently la unched initiative of WHO/PAHO and the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS (UNAID S), sought to increase the availability of ARV drugs at affordable prices. To date, 26 countries in the Americas had indicated a desire to participate in the initiative. El even evaluation and planning missions had been organized, and negotiations for the reduction of drug prices had been finalized or were under way in seven countries. Additionally, th e possibility of a subregional pricing agreement for the CARICOM countries was being discussed. Several recent events had afforded the opportunity to step up the response to the epidemic. One was the United Nations Gene ral Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS, held in June 2001, which had been discussed by the Committee at its 128th Session. Others events were the establishment of the new Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which had alr eady approved funding proposals from a number of countries in the Region, and the signing of the Shared Agenda for Health, an agreement between PAHO, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the World Bank for collaboration on a range of health issues, including HIV/ AIDS. Countries were also joining forces in subregional partnerships. At the internati onal level, in addition to the Accelerating Access to ARV initiative, W HO had developed a global health-sector strategy for addressing HIV/ AIDS and other STIs. The 14 th International AIDS CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 14 Conference, which would take place in July 2002 in Barcelona, w ould provide further opportunities for confronting the myriad challenges created by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Dr. Zacar\u00edas concluded by emphasizing that the experience of the past had shown what worked and what needed to be done to halt the spread of HIV. Sufficient knowledge existed to dramatically improve the HIV/AI DS situation by 2010. The action taken by the countries of the world over th e next few years would dete rmine whether or not that occurred. The Executive Committee applauded P AHO's comprehensive regional response to HIV/AIDS and endorsed the \"Building Bloc ks\" approach, which highlighted the need to strengthen health systems and viewed prev ention and care not as competing priorities, but as part of the health care continuum. Delegates underscored the need to improve the accessibility and affordability of antiretroviral drugs, since it was essential to provide treatment to the millions of people in the Region who were already infected with the virus. Support was voiced for the public he alth approach to antiretroviral therapy advocated by WHO. In additi on, it was felt that assuring treatment and care for HIV- infected persons would help reduce the stig ma and discrimination to which they were often subjected. Moreover, treatment and car e could be key strategies for preventing transmission. In that connection, Dr. Zacar \u00edas was asked to update the Committee on PAHO's efforts to negotiate price agreements and facilita te access to ARV drugs through the Revolving Fund for Strategic Public Health Supplies. The Committee also commended PAHO on its efforts to promote and implement the UNGASS declaration and stressed the need for ongoing monitoring and reporting on the achievement of the goals established by the countries at the special session. With regard to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tube rculosis, and Malaria, delegates expressed the hope that the secretariat being created to manage the Fund would be kept as small as possible so that the funds mobilized would not be eaten up by administrative costs. The Committee acknowledged the need for a coor dinated international response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic because, as the docum ent rightly pointed out, it was a global problem with far-reaching effects. Various Member States described cooperative initiatives between their governments and othe r countries in the Region to combat the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. One delegate observed that the problem of HIV/AIDS had a \"silver lining\" in the sense that it had given rise to unprecedented levels of international and intersectoral collaboration, which would translate into gains in other areas, such as poverty alleviation and improvement in overall health conditions. Several possible improvements to the doc ument were proposed. It was suggested that the section on comprehensive care might be enhanced if it placed greater emphasis on the role that communities and community-bas ed organizations coul d play in reducing CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 15 the spread of HIV and providing support for in fected individuals a nd their families. It was also pointed out that comprehensive ca re should include voluntary and confidential testing and counseling, so that people would know their HIV status and could deal with it appropriately, together with psycho-social support for inf ected individuals and their families and communities. Various delegates noted that the document did not address the role of research and its importance in provi ding the basis for development of policies and interventions. Delegates also underscored the need fo r health promotion and education that focused on cultural attitudes and practices that were at the r oot of individual behaviors. While the document correctly stressed the ne ed for behavioral change, interventions aimed at individuals had had mixed success t hus far. It was therefore necessary to broaden health promotion efforts and end eavor to change cultural patterns that encouraged or discouraged certain behaviors. The Delegate of Uruguay called attention to an error in the document, which stated that intravenous drug use was the principal mode of HIV transmission in his country; in f act, the largest proportion of HIV-positive individuals in Uruguay had become infected through sexual relations. The representative of ULACETS welcom ed the document's recognition of the importance of sexually transmitted infections other than HIV/AIDS. She announced that the World Congress on Sexually Transmitted Inf ections and AIDS would take place in Uruguay in 2003\u2014the first time that event had ev er been held in th e hemisphere. A main topic of discussion at the Congress would be interventions on HIV/AIDS and other STIs that could be applied in resource-poor settings. Dr. Zacar\u00edas agreed with the delegates' comments on the importance of research, noting that the PAHO Program on HIV/AI DS had initially had a strong research orientation, and it continued to promote research. Another ingr edient that was crucial in the fight against HIV/AIDS\u2014in addition to th e commitment of financial resources\u2014was leadership. Governments in a number of count ries were showing how effective political leadership could foster the kind of intersec toral action needed to address the many facets of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Regarding the comments on the importance of involving the community in the response to HIV/AIDS, he emphasized that the comprehensive approach advocated under th e \"Building Blocks\" model s ought to go beyond the health services system and work with the entire community. It was true that changing behaviors and their underlying cultural roots was a long- term undertaking. Still, changes in attitude were occurring, as evidenced, for example, by the increase in condom use in some countri es. To bring about la sting change, it was essential to focus health education and communication efforts on young people. For that reason, the HIV/AIDS program was working with the adolescent health program to CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 16 identify effective behavior change interventions. The program was also conducting a study to assess the impact of health education campaigns in 13 countries. As for the Organization's negotiations on ARV drug pricin g, he reported that the results had been mixed thus far. The pha rmaceutical companies continued to impose conditions that limited countries' ability to obtain ARV drugs at reduced prices. However, the PAHO/WHO Repres entatives and health offici als in some countries had succeeded in negotiating satisfactory price ag reements. PAHO would continue to support Member States' efforts to negotiate affordable prices. The Director thanked the Member Stat es that were assisting PAHO and their sister countries in the Region in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the Americas, especially the Caribbean. He concurred fully with thos e delegates who had pointed out that the resources of the Global Fund should not be expended unnecessarily on administrative costs, which would defeat the Fund's pur pose. PAHO was committed to working with UNAIDS to facilitate access to the Fund without creati ng additional layers of bureaucracy. He also agreed with the Comm ittee's observations on the importance of health education that targeted the roots of in dividual behaviors. To date, most behavioral change initiatives had been directed at indi viduals. Rather than that approach, which tended to blame the victim, there must be gr eater emphasis on creating environments that allowed and encouraged individuals to ch ange their behaviors. PAHO's technical cooperation in this area wa s now directed largely towa rds fostering such change. The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R6 on this item. Vaccines and Immunization (Document CE130/10) Dr. Ciro de Quadros (Director, Divi sion of Vaccines and Immunization, PAHO) reported that DTP3 vaccination coverage among children (i.e., three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) had remained at around 80% for the Americas as a whole in recent years. Coverage in a larg e number of districts continued to fall below the regional goal of 95%, however, and there were sizable disparities in coverage between countries and between regions within countries. Hence, much remained to be done to achieve full equity with regard to immunization. Substantial progress had been made toward s the goal of eradicating measles in the Americas. A recent outbreak in Venezuela, which had spread to Colombia, was expected to be under control by the time the Pan American Sanitary Conference convened in September, and it was anticipated that indigenous transmission would have been interrupted throughout the Region by the e nd of 2002. As for poliomyelitis, the only cases reported in the Region in the past de cade had been vaccine-derived cases on the island of Hispaniola, the last of which had o ccurred in Haiti in July 2001. At present, the CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 17 disease was completely under control. Neonatal tetanus remained a pr oblem in less than 1% of districts in the Americas. With concer ted effort, it could be eliminated very soon. Rubella, too, could be elimin ated through accelerated contro l strategies that emphasized vaccination of susceptible adults as well as routine immunization of children. Yellow fever had shown a sharp downward trend since 1998 as a result of vaccination campaigns. The vaccine shortages of the previ ous year had been largely overcome, so it would now be possible to intensif y vaccination in high-risk areas. Evaluations conducted in various c ountries between 1996 and 2001 had shown that to ensure the sustainability of nati onal immunization programs and maintain the progress achieved thus far, attention to three problems was needed: (1) weakened regulatory and control capacity of central government instituti ons as a result of health sector reform and decentraliza tion, (2) lack of clearly define d financial responsibility for immunization programs, and (3) lack of account ability for specific immunization goals. Action was also needed to cl ose the equity gap between i ndustrialized and developing countries with respect to the introduction of new and combination vaccines, although that gap was relatively small in the Americas compared to other regions, thanks to the countries' strong commitme nt to immunization. An important component of PAHO's t echnical cooperation was the development of tools and strategies to ge nerate information that woul d enable decision-makers to prioritize the introduction of newly developed vaccines and measure their impact. The Organization was also working to develop an d enhance vaccine production capacity in the countries as a means of ensuring the availability of hi gh-quality vaccines and alleviating the vaccine shortage s that had affected all coun tries in the Region in recent years. Finally, in regard to the threat of a reemergence of smallpox as a result of bioterrorism, Dr. de Quadros said that two technical meetings convened by the Director had examined the issue and assessed the po ssibilities for smallpox vaccine production in the Region. The principal conclusion of the meetings was that PAHO should continue collaborating with the countri es to strengthen epidemiol ogical surveillan ce systems and improve the infrastructure for identifying cases, including the regional network of laboratories for diagnosis of febrile rash illne sses. Meeting participants had also stressed that an attack of smallpox on one country should be viewed as an attack on all the countries of the Region and that, in the spir it of Pan Americanism, countries that had stocks of vaccine should make them availa ble to the affected country to prevent the disease from spreading. The Executive Committee commende d PAHO for its continued work in strengthening capacity for surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing immunization coverage, and facilitating countries' acces s to vaccines through the CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 18 Revolving Fund for Vaccine Procurement. Th e Committee also expressed support for the Organization's efforts to increase vaccine pr oduction throughout the region, as increased supply would help reduce vaccine prices, even in non-producing countries. Maintaining national immunization programs\u2014with guara nteed funding for those programs\u2014was considered a priority responsibility of govern ments. The Delegate of Peru reported that his country had enacted legislation to pr otect the budget for immunization activities. Those funds could not be used for any othe r purpose, irrespective of any financial exigencies that might arise. As a result, Pe ru had been able to introduce the rubella vaccine, despite its adverse economic situation. Delegates expressed concern that the ec onomic problems currently afflicting most countries in the Region might ma ke it difficult to maintain the successes of the past and attain regional goals, such as the eradication of measles. One delegate proposed the idea of creating an alternative mechanism, such as an emergency or compensation fund, to assist countries when financial constraint s prevented them from purchasing vaccines through the PAHO Revolving Fund. The vaccine s hortages of recent years were also seen as a threat to the Region's achievements in the control of vaccine-preventable diseases. Dr. de Quadros was asked to expound on the r easons for the shortages and whether they were likely to reach crisis proportions. The representatives of the Inter-Am erican Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank assured the Committee of their re spective institutions' willingness to work with the countries to overcome the problems cr eated by decentralization and health sector reform and maintain strong national immu nization programs. Both representatives emphasized the need to make ministers of finance and other economic authorities aware of the cost-effectiveness of immunization an d involve them in di scussions regarding financing for vaccination programs. The repr esentative of the IDB felt that there was merit in the idea of a compensation fund or other mechanism to enable the countries to continue purchasing vaccines during difficu lt economic times. The representative of the World Bank suggested that, as a means of promoting discussion of vaccine financing issues among national authorities, the Secretar iat might include in the revised version of the document a section addressing some of the concerns raised by the Executive Committee, in particular the idea of a fina ncing mechanism to complement the Revolving Fund; the financial and logistic challenges f acing immunization programs, given the need to introduce new vaccines while maintaining and increasing the coverage of existing ones; and the protection of national immunization budgets. In light of the interest expressed by th e representatives of the World Bank and the IDB, the Executive Committee requested the Di rector to explore with the Banks and other partners the possibility of establishing a financing mechanism to complement the PAHO Revolving Fund that would enable countries to assure an uninterrupted supply of vaccines for their national immunization programs. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 19 Dr. de Quadros welcomed the comments of the IDB and World Bank representatives, which augured well for increased collaborati on in the area of vaccines and immunization under the PAHO/IDB/Worl d Bank Shared Agenda. The World Bank representative's suggestions regarding the document were excellent, and he would see that they were incorporated into the re vised version. He emphasized the need for countries to prioritize the issue of financ ing for vaccines and immunization in their negotiations with the Banks. Ministries of health had a key role to play in that regard by ensuring that immunization had a prominent place on national agendas. Regarding the question of whether lack of funding and vaccine shortages might hinder the achievement of goals such as erad ication of measles, he pointed out that financing was often not the main problem. In the case of measles, non-implementation of vaccination and control strategi es and lack of clarity about which strategies to employ had been the largest impediments to eradication of the disease. As for the vaccine shortage, the main causes were the introduc tion of more stringent quality requirements and limited capacity for vaccine lyophilizat ion. Concern over vaccine safety had prompted regulatory authorities to impose in creasingly strict quality control procedures, which slowed the production process. Anothe r issue was use of installed capacity. The major vaccine manufacturers had made a comme rcial decision to utilize their production facilities mainly to make the newer, more expensive vaccines, leading to a temporary shortage of the less costly ones. However, the problem wa s expected to be resolved within the next 18 to 24 months. In the Americas, PAHO was working to meet vaccine needs by helping countries boost their nationa l production capacity and obtain certification as vaccine suppliers for th e United Nations system. For example, laboratories in Brazil and Cuba were now certified as supplie rs of yellow fever vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine, respectively. The Director said he would be pleased to explore with the IDB and World Bank the feasibility of creating a financing mechanism to facilitate vaccine procurement. He pointed out that the Banks c ould be eloquent allies with PAHO in making the case with governments for assuring sufficient funding fo r vaccination programs, since, apart from the obvious health reasons, there were for ceful economic arguments for investing in vaccines. Vaccination should be seen as an essential public good and, by definition, public goods should be financed by governments. Peru had set an excellent example by enacting legislation to protect the budget for vaccines, and he hoped that other countries might draw on its experience to put in place similar protections. The Banks might also help in discu ssions with drug companies by arguing for stabilization of prices for vaccines and other essential pharmaceuticals. Vaccine pricing was one of the few areas in which the Organization had succeeded in negotiating common pricing with producers. In the case of other drugs, notably ARVs, they had CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 20 insisted on applying different prices to diffe rent categories of countries. In his opinion, there was no valid argument for that practice. The health workers of the Region dese rved great praise for their success in bringing vaccine-preventable di seases under control. To get an idea of the magnitude of their efforts and accomplishments, it sufficed to recall that in the Americas only 537 cases of measles had been confirmed in 2001, whereas worldwide th ere had been 800,000 deaths from the disease and many more cases. Thanks to the hard work and commitment of the many health workers across the Americas, there was every reason to believe that by the end of the year, the Re gion could add elimination of indigenous transmission of measles to its list of accomplishments. The Committee adopted Resolution CE 130.R7 on vaccines and immunization. Evaluation of the Strategic and Programmatic Orientations, 1999-2002 (Documents CE130/11 and CE130/INF/1) Dr. Germ\u00e1n Perdomo (Senior Policy Advi sor, Office of Analysis and Strategic Planning, PAHO) summarized the results of the evaluation of the Strategic and Programmatic Orientations (SPOs), 1999-2002, which was presented to the Executive Committee pursuant to a resolution of the 25 th Pan American Sanitary Conference in 1998. The SPOs had guided the programming of technical cooperation by PAHO's Secretariat, the Pan American Sanitary Bur eau, with the countries during the period in question. When the Conference had approve d the SPOs in 1998, it had also urged the countries to take them into account when fo rmulating their national health policies, and the 36th Session of the Subcommittee on Planni ng and Programming had specifically requested that the Secretariat examine the extent to which that had occurred. Hence, the evaluation had looked both at the progress made in achieving the regional goals and applying the programmatic orientations and at whether the SPOs had been reflected in national health plans and policies for 1999-2002. Information from 32 countries indicated th at 5 countries had dr aft policies and 27 had already adopted national policies or plans. The Bureau had been involved in national policy-making processes in 22 of those countries. The SPOs had been used as frame of reference for policy development in 15 of the 22 countries. Regarding the Bureau's implementation of the SPOs, a survey of professional staff had shown that 87% were familiar with the SPOs, and all those staff were applying them not only in the programming of technica l cooperation but in other activities, such as negotiating cooperation projects and briefing national officials. Only staff who had recently joined the Bureau and those not di rectly involved in technical cooperation (e.g., administrative staff) were unfamiliar with the SPOs. In the last two biennia, the vast CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 21 majority (around 90%) of technical coope ration projects programmed had been specifically related to the programmatic orient ations. Those that had not were projects related to managerial development or project s that addressed specific national needs that fell outside the framework of the SPOs. Evaluation of the impact of the tec hnical cooperation pr ovided under the SPOs had been hindered by several methodological di fficulties, notably the fact that PAHO was not the only organization provi ding technical cooperation in the countries, which made it difficult to pinpoint the precise effects of its act ivities. In additi on, the necessary information and indicators had not always be en available. Of the 29 regional goals adopted under the SPOs, the evaluation had f ound that 5 were fully achieved and 13 were partially achieved. Little or no progress had been made in the case of 2 goals, and for the remaining 9 goals, the informati on available was insufficient, unavailable, out of date, or not comparable across countries. Docume nt CD130/INF/1 contained a detailed description of the cooperation pr ovided and the outcomes achieved. The evaluation had yielded a number of lessons, which had been extremely useful in the development of the Strategic Plan for 2003-2007. In particular, it had pointed up the need for broad internal and external part icipation in the strategic planning process, greater clarity and precision in the description of expected results and how to achieve them, a manageable number of goals and objectives for technical cooperation and organizational development, goals and objectiv es that represented a challenge but were achievable, clear definition of goals and objec tives so as to facilitate monitoring and evaluation, continued effort to enhance nationa l information systems in order to produce the data necessary for monitoring and evaluati on, and wide dissemination of the Strategic Plan, both internally and externally. The Executive Committee acknowledge d the difficulty of undertaking an evaluation of such large magnitude and co mmended the Secretariat for its efforts to measure the impact of the SPOs. Several dele gates suggested that th e evaluation could be strengthened through greater anal ysis of the goals that were not met and the reasons for the lack of progress in those areas. Such an an alysis would be helpful in setting goals and planning how to achieve them in the peri od 2003-2007. Delegates also cautioned against setting too many goals for the next period, as the large num ber of goals may have added to the difficulty of evaluating the SPOs for 1999-2002. The Committee felt that the evaluation's greatest value was perhaps the lessons learned, which would help improve planning fo r the next period and avoid some of the problems that had hindered monitori ng and evaluation in 1999-2002. One of those problems was overly broad goals and objectives . In order to assess progress, it was necessary to state the goals in precise a nd specific terms. Another problem that had complicated evaluation of the SPOs was lack of baseline information to provide a point CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 22 of reference from which to measure change in indicators. Several delegates observed that the goals established for individual coun tries or groups of countries would vary, depending on the baseline. In the case of ma ternal mortality, for example, in countries that already had low rates, it would be diffi cult to achieve large a dditional reductions, so the goal must be set lower than in the case of countries with relatively high rates. In addition, in formulating goals and objectives , it was necessary to allow for unforeseen circumstances, both external and internal, th at might affect their achievement and to recognize that the attainment of many health goals required the participation of other sectors. It was also necessary to improve national information systems and standardize the data being produced in order to permit comparisons and remedy the information deficits mentioned in the evaluation report. The Committee was pleased that the reco mmendations of the SPP had been taken into account in ca rrying out the final eval uation, in particular the assessment of the countries' incorporation of the SPOs into their national planning and policy-making. The findings were indicative of the extent to whic h regional strategic pla nning had influenced the planning and work of the health sector in the countries. At the same time, however, the Organization's planning should be informed by national strategic planning in order to ensure that its technical cooperation responded to the priorities and needs identified by the countries. In that regard, delegates commen ded the Secretariat for its efforts to make the planning and evaluation processes as pa rticipatory as possible and, especially, for seeking to involve Member States from the outset in strategic planning for the next period. The Representative of the Inter-Am erican Development Bank (IDB) called attention to the need to take account of global and regional development goals in the Organization's strategic planni ng. He agreed that measuri ng the impact of technical cooperation was extremely difficult. To do so, it was essential to put in place a methodology for evaluation from the start of th e strategic planning pr ocess. It was also necessary to allocate resources (human and financial) specifically for evaluation. The IDB would be pleased to collaborate with PAHO in carrying out joint technical cooperation evaluations with a view to overcoming some of the difficulties encountered in the evaluation of the SPOs. Dr. Perdomo thanked the delegates for their suggestions, which would help the Secretariat improve the evaluation report to be presented to the Pan American Sanitary Conference. He pointed out that another issue that complicated the planning and evaluation process was that of accountabil ity for the goals esta blished. On various occasions in recent years the Governing Bodi es had discussed whether the SPOs were the exclusive responsibility of the Secretaria t or whether the c ountries also had a responsibility for achieving some of the goals . For many of the objectives established by the Organization and then incorporated into the Secretariat's strategic planning and CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 23 programming, governments had an undeniable re sponsibility, as they were responsible for health at the national level. Analyzing the health situation at the country level and assessing the effects of technical cooperation required a comprehens ive evaluation model, supported by reliable information systems. Another challenge, as the Committee had noted, was finding methodologies that would enable the Secretaria t to explain the results and identify the factors that had impeded or facilitated achie vement of objectives, including both external factors and structural and institutional fact ors within the Organi zation. The Secretariat would continue working to address those chal lenges and improve the evaluation process. The Director was pleased that the delegates had considered the evaluation process worthwhile. Despite its shortcomings, he believed the exercise had been useful, especially because it had pointed up the pitfal ls that the Secretariat should take care to avoid in the next planning cycle. Moreover, he believed it was healt hy for an organization to look at whether it had accomplished the objectives it had set for itself. As the Committee had pointed out, one of challenges with evaluation was to ensure that the process was evaluable from the beginning. It was also necessary to have good information to determine whether goals had been realized or not. PAHO had been working to improve information production in the Region, and the countries had made tremendous strides in strengthening their information systems and increasing the availability of data. They ha d also made progress in disagg regating information so as to reveal inequalities between geographic areas and population groups. As a result, much better information would be avai lable for future evaluations. He agreed that, to ensure evaluability, it was essential to state goals as precisely as possible. Nevertheless, some goals were inhere ntly more difficult to measure than others. Process goals, for example, were especially difficult to measure. He also agreed that differences between and within countries must be taken into account in setting goals. It was important to avoid the \"tyranny of sta tistical means,\" which did not reflect such differences. If it was accepted that part of the Organization's mission was to enhance equity, then goals must be cast as equity goa ls. That meant setting goals not only in terms of specific percentages or le vels, but also in terms of reducing the gaps between and within countries. The Committee took note of the report on the evaluation, but did not consider it necessary to adopt a resolution on this item (Decision CE130(D4)). CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 24 Strategic Plan for the Pan American Sa nitary Bureau for the Period 2003-2007 (Document CE130/12) Dr. Karen Sealey (Chief, Office of An alysis and Strategic Planning, PAHO) presented the Strategic Plan for the peri od 2003-2007. She began by pointing out that, as the Organization celebrated its centennial, it was appropriate that it should begin to prepare for the next 100 year s of health in the Region. The Strategic Plan for 2003-2007 would mark the first step in that directi on. She then outlined the key features of the planning process, emphasizing that the plan 's formulation had been guided by the principles of equity and Pan Americanism, ideals to which PAHO had been committed throughout its 100-year history. The planning process had sought to define the technical cooperation priorities the Bureau would focu s on to support the health development needs of the countries and determine how it could enhance its own performance in order to better meet those needs. The process had differed from the previ ous planning process in several important ways. For the first time, the Strategic Plan woul d span five years, not four, as in the case of previous planning framewor ks. In addition, the mission of the Secretariat had been redefined and its values and vision had been clarified, and those definitions had been used to drive the process of strategic planni ng. The planning process had been guided not only by the traditional analysis of the exte rnal environment, but by an internal assessment, which sought to identify the Secretariat's strengths and weaknesses and establish a baseline for monitoring its performance. In developing the plan, the Secretariat had also been very mindful of the lessons learned from the evaluation of the SPOs. The process had identified not only te chnical areas for action but organization- wide critical issues. For each of those areas and issues, the Secretariat had developed objectives and strategies, which would be implemented through technical cooperation projects and organizational development initiatives. Finally, monitoring and evaluation had been built into the planning process. The values that would guide the Bureau's work were equity, excellence, solidarity, respect, and integrity. Its vision was to be the major catalyst for ensuring that all the peoples of the Americas enjoyed optimal health and contributed to the well-being of their families and communities. Its mission was to lead strategic collaborative efforts among Member States and other partners to prom ote equity in health, to combat disease, and to improve the quality of and lengthen th e lives of the peoples of the Americas. The plan set out in Document CE130/12 represented the Bureau 's response to the situation revealed by the internal and exte rnal analyses, the findings of which were summarized in the document. The plan identi fied three major priorities for technical cooperation: special populat ion groups (low-income or poor populations; ethnic and racial groups, especially i ndigenous populations; and women and children); key countries CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 25 (highly indebted poor countries (HIPC) and/or countries which had an intolerable state of health, in particular Haiti, Bolivia, Hondur as, Guyana, and Nicaragua); and priority technical areas. The plan included eight such areas: (1) prevention, control, and reduction of communicable diseases; (2) prevention, co ntrol, and reduction of noncommunicable diseases; (3) promotion of h ealthy lifestyles and social e nvironments; (4) healthy growth and development; (5) promotion of safe physical environments; (6) disaster preparedness, management, and response; (7) ensuring univers al access to integrated, equitable, and sustainable health systems; and (8) promoti on of effective health input into social, economic, cultural, and development policies. In each area, the key issues and challenges were described, as were the objectives fo r the Bureau's techni cal cooperation and its strengths and weaknesses a nd opportunities for action. The plan also identified six critical organizational issues for enhancing the Bureau's effectiveness and efficiency: (1 ) bridging the information and communication gap and maximizing information and commu nication technology; (2) better foresight; (3) harnessing science and technol ogy to address the problems of inequity in the Region; (4) positioning the Bureau to influence transn ational and global issu es; (5) attracting and retaining a creative, competent, and committe d workforce; and (6) making the Bureau a high-performance organization. The Secretariat recognized that the plan needed further refining and that, once it was approved, a communication strategy would be needed to keep the staff informed and provide feedback on its implementation. In addition, monitoring and evaluation must be an integral part of the process. Recognizing th at it was working in an arena in which there were many other actors, the Secretariat had e ndeavored to formulate objectives that were as specific as possible so as to facilitate the evaluation of its contribution to health development in the Region and avoid the pr oblems that had hindered evaluation of the impact of technical cooperat ion in the previous period. The Executive Committee congratulated Dr. Sealey and her team for having produced a clear and comprehensive document, which represented a great improvement over previous planning documents and a goo d start to strategic planning for the new millennium. Delegates commented that the plan presented a vision for the work of the Organization in the long term as well as a framework for the technical cooperation of the Secretariat in the next five years. Delegate s also commended the Secretariat for its efforts to seek maximum input from Member States and other stakeholders in the process of formulating the plan. The Committee welcomed the changes made since the SPP had considered the Strategic Plan in March 2002, in particular the addition of specific mentions of indigenous groups and children am ong the special groups to be targeted. However, it was pointed out that some of the recommendatio ns made during the SPP session had not been CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 26 incorporated, notably those c oncerning the section on globali zation and the vision of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau. In relation to the former, the Secretariat was asked to try to present a more balanced view, acknowledging some of the potential opportunities that globalization might afford for he alth development as well as its adverse effects. As for the vision statement, the Secretariat was again asked to consider changing the wording to \"PASB will be a major catalyst for ensuring that all peoples of the Americas enjoy optimal health,\" recognizing that numerous other agencies and organizations were working to improve health in the Americas. In that connection, it was suggested that there should be greater recognition of the role of other multilateral agencies, especially the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and NGOs working in the area of h ealth. It was also pointed out that the document did not mention PAHO's collaborati on with the IDB and the World Bank in the framework of the Shared Agenda for Health. Some concern was expre ssed as to whether the document correctly portrayed PAHO's role vis-\u00e0-vis the countries. One delega te felt that some of the language in the document needed to be adjusted to make it clear that PAHO was not a supranational organization, but an organizati on that reflected the interests of its Member States and collaborated with them to foster health de velopment in the Americas. Other delegates pointed out that the document was intended to guide the te chnical cooperation of the Secretariat with the countries an d that it clearly st ated that PASB helped the countries to help themselves and that it carried out it s functions in collaboration with the Member States. Moreover, the priorities for 2003-2007 ha d been identified in consultation with the countries and reflected the priorities they had established for impr oving the health of their populations. However, one delegate sugge sted that a clearer statement of how the Secretariat would help the countries achieve their goals was needed. The same delegate pointed out that meeting certain goals was often a condition for obt aining financing and other forms of international cooperation, and th at PASB, as the countries' primary partner in the area of health, should make a measurable commitment to work with the countries to achieve those goals. Delegates felt that the eight priority t echnical areas accurately reflected the major regional priorities for health development in the Region; however, some cautioned that the plan might identify too many priorities. The Representative of the IDB pointed out that priorities, by definition, should be few in number and suggested that the Secretariat might wish to clarify which of the priorities would be the focus of work in the period 2003-2007 and which represented longer-term strategic objectives. Some delegates thought that the objectives define d under each priority should be stated in more precise and measurable terms in order to facilitat e monitoring and evaluation. One objective, for example, was to \"reduce morbidity due to TB , malaria, and dengue,\" but it did not set any specific goal, which would make it difficult to measure progress. The need to clearly link CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 27 the regional priorities with global priorities established by WHO and with international goals and mandates was also emphasized. One delegate noted that the classificati on of the countries of the Region according to their stage of demographic transition diffe red from the classification systems used by other agencies and pointed out such classifi cations could have pot entially detrimental consequences. For example, a country's classi fication in a certain income category might affect its eligibility for credit and techni cal cooperation. The Repres entative of the IDB commented that the plan's focus on a very limited number of countries might raise questions of fairness and equity, especia lly since other countri es in the Region had conditions and problems similar to those of the key countries. Delegates made a number of other suggestions for further refining the document, and some also submitted additional proposed changes in writing. One delegate thought that the document would be st rengthened if there were a di scussion of the assumptions on which the Strategic Plan was based, the risk s that might affect its implementation, and strategies for dealing with thos e risks. The same delegate called attention to the need to ensure sufficient financial and human resource s to carry out the plan. Another delegate suggested that referen ces in the document to \"reproductive health services \" be changed to \"reproductive health care,\" as that term was more inclusive and more closely aligned with the terminology currently in use in other inte rnational forums. It was pointed that the document set no objective with regard to cardiovascular disease, and it was suggested that a goal for reduction of hypertension be incl uded. In relation to the section on disaster management, it was emphasized that addressing the threat of bioterrorism should be a priority for every country and for the Organization, which had long been a leader in the hemisphere in emergency preparedness and mitigation. Dr. Sealey thanked the de legates for their constructi ve suggestions, which would help the Secretariat to con tinue improving the plan. She wi shed to allay any concerns about the Bureau's functions: the Bureau existed to serve and cooperate with the countries, and the plan was intended to gui de it in carrying out those functions. The Bureau was well aware that it did not operate in a vacuum and that it must take account of both the other actors worki ng in the health sector and the priorities, mandates, and commitments from the various international summits and other sources. In fact, in drawing up the plan, the Secretariat had cr eated a whole matrix that showed the relationship between PAHO's priorities and th e priorities of WHO, the United Nations millennium development goals, and the goals an d objectives arising from the Summits of the Americas and other forums. The next ve rsion of the document would show those linkages more clearly. In light of the Committee's comments, it might be advisable to rethink the classification of the countries and the identific ation of key countries, bearing in mind that CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 28 it might become necessary to shift the focus to other countries. Howe ver, it was clear that the Governing Bodies had agreed that identifying key countries, key groups, and priorities for technical cooperation was desira ble. Many of the other concerns raised by the Committee would be addressed as the Secr etariat began to implement the plan. The allocation of resources, for example, would be examined when the Governing Bodies reviewed the Organization's budget policy, as recommended by the SPP in 2000. As for testing of assumptions and risk assessment, that would occur when the biennial program budget was formulated. She concluded by em phasizing the importance of two-way planning that reconciled national health priorities with the regional objectives to which the countries had agreed. The Director said that, in his 21 years with the Orga nization, he had never seen a planning process that had been so participatory and iterative. The Secretariat had taken to heart the lessons learned from the previous pl anning cycle, one of which had been that it needed to involve a broad range of stakeholders in planning for 2003-2007. The Strategic Plan represented a sea change in several respects. Earlier planning documents had established joint responsibilities for the Bureau and the countries. Later, they had reflected what the Bureau would do in collaboration with the countries. Never before had a strategic planning document identified organiza tional issues that need ed to be addressed in order to achieve the objectives establis hed. The Secretariat was committing itself to make the internal modifications needed to collaborate effectively with the member countries in the eight priority areas described in the plan. He emphasized that those eight areas had not been chosen with the current structure of the Secretariat in mind. He believed that structure must follow function, not vice versa. After the plan was approved, the structure of the Secretariat would be adjusted as needed. As Dr. Sealey had said, the Secretariat was at the service of the countries. He assured the Committee that PAHO would neve r attempt to adopt any supranational posture. In regard to the vision statement, he urged the delegates to allow the Secretariat to retain the wording that appeared in the document. PASB truly di d aspire to be the major catalyst for health development in th e Region. It did not wa nt to be one among many; it wanted to be the best. With respect to the identification of prio rity countries, he hoped it was clear that that approach was reflective of the values th at guided PAHO, especially equity and Pan Americanism. If the Organization really beli eved in those values, it should collectively assume some responsibility for improving the situation of countries that were at a disadvantage with respect to other countries. That was why individual countries had been selected as a point of focus. He agreed that other criteria might be applied to identify those countries, and if it became clear that it was necessary to shift the focus, the Secretariat would do so. But he believed that, at least initia lly, it was appropriate to give special consideration to the four HIPC countries plus Haiti. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 29 Regarding the lack of precision and measur able objectives, he pointed out that the objectives set forth in the document were st rategic objectives for technical cooperation, not specific goals with established timeframes for achievement. Specific goals and expected results would be defined in the bi ennial program budget, as would indicators for monitoring progress. Concerning monitoring and evaluation, by the time the SPP met in March 2003, the Secretariat should be in a pos ition to provide more specific information on the methodology that would be used for that purpose. Achievement of the objectives se t under the plan w ould depend on the Secretariat's capacity for execution, whic h was somewhat limited. Nevertheless, the Secretariat would make the be st possible use of the human and financial resources which the Member States had generously put at its di sposal in order to fully execute the plan. The Executive Committee adopted Reso lution CE130.R1, endorsing the Strategic Plan. Integrated Management of Child hood Illness (Document CE130/13) Dr. Yehuda Benguigui (Regional Advi sor on Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, PAHO) reviewed the b ackground and content of the strategy for integrated management of childhood illness (IM CI) and the progress ac hieved as a result of its application. He also described th e challenges to expa nding the strategy. In the Region of the Americas, approximately half a million children continued to die from preventable causes and, of t hose deaths, close to 200,000 could be easily avoided with existing technologies. WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) had developed IMCI in the early 1990s as a strategy for preventing deaths, reducing illness, and improving health conditi ons and care for children in the first five years of life. The defining characteristic of the IMCI strategy was that it focused on the health and well-being of the whole child, not on specific disease processes. It incorporated prevention and health prom otion as part of care, avoiding missed opportunities for early detection and treatment of diseases, prevention of illness, and health promotion for the child and the enti re family. Moreover, IMCI was a tool for promoting equity in health b ecause it could be made availa ble to the population through health services at the first level of care. PAHO had officially introduced th e strategy in 1996. In 1999, the Directing Council of PAHO had adopted Resolution CD 41.R5, urging the Member States to adopt and expand implementation of the IMCI strategy and requesting the Director to actively support the process. Healthy Children: Goal 2002, an initiative launc hed by the Director that same year, aimed to prevent 100,000 d eaths of under-5 children during the period 1999-2002 and ensure access to the IMCI strategy, especially for the most vulnerable CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 30 groups. By late 2001, 17 of the Region's count ries had adopted the strategy and all had embraced the Healthy Children initiative. The results had been highly positive. During the first year of Healthy Children, for exampl e, more than 33,000 child deaths had been averted. Evaluations revealed significant improve ments, as well, in various indicators of quality of care, such as misu se of antibiotics and other dr ugs to treat acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. Nevertheless, a number of challenges re mained. To extend the strategy's benefits, it was necessary to ensure its effective use by all health workers, including community health workers; pr ioritize vulnerable popul ation groups; and incorporate IMCI into training and mandatory social service programs for health professionals. It was also necessary to tailor the strategy to the epid emiological profiles of the countries by adapting it to address asthma, violence and ch ild abuse, diabetes, and overweight, and other child health problems prevalent in the Region. Other challenges included encouraging the use of the 16 key family practices identified by WHO and UNICEF for ensuring healthy growth and development of children and mobilizing resources for expanding the application of IMCI. The Executive Committee expressed firm support for the IMCI approach. Along with immunization, the strategy was seen as a pillar for improving child health and reducing health inequalities between popul ation groups. The Committee also endorsed expansion of the strategy to include other components, especially activities to address perinatal causes of death, which would also help reduce maternal mortality. However, it was emphasized that funds invested in expa nding the strategy should include resources for surveillance and evaluation to track the st rategy's progress and impact. One delegate suggested that the document should incl ude a specific section on evaluation and monitoring of the IMCI strategy and the ac tions required of the countries and the Organization to improve IMCI coverage and effectiveness. It was also considered necessary to rigorously evaluate the 16 key practices to ensure that future interventions remained relevant and were based on sound evidence and experience. Members voiced concern that the human resources needed to expand IMCI were insufficient. The strategy should focus on hea lth workers that had maximum contact with vulnerable families and communities, which meant that more nursing and auxiliary personnel were required, especial ly at the primary care level. The Region currently had a doctor-nurse ratio of 6:1, which represente d a significant obstacl e to the strategy's expansion. It was therefore recommended th at the resolution on this item call for strengthening of the number and diversity of human resources to deal effectively with ill children and the causes of illness. Dr. Benguigui agreed that develo pment of human resources and ongoing monitoring and evaluation were crucial to su ccessful implementation of the strategy. In CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 31 regard to the former, PAHO was working with schools that trained pe diatricians, nurses, nutritionists, and other health professionals, with a view to introducing more instruction on primary health care and application of th e IMCI strategy to complement the current training programs, which remained focused largely on hospital-based care for complex syndromes. The Organization was concentrati ng, in particular, on the thousands of medical school graduates in the Region who we re required to perform social service for 10 to 12 months in remote areas, as thos e young professionals offered an excellent opportunity for extending the strategy's benefits to underserved populations. With regard to monitoring and evalua tion, countries in the Region of the Americas had been chosen to take part in a multi-country evaluation of the effectiveness, cost, and impact of the IMCI strategy, c oordinated by WHO Hea dquarters in Geneva. The evaluation was designed to assess the st rategy's cost effectiveness and determine whether it had a significant impact on im proving child health, mortality, nutritional status, and family behaviors. In additi on, WHO had developed guidelines for follow-up after training as a means of re inforcing health workers' skills in the application of IMCI and gathering information on their performan ce in order to improve implementation of the strategy. As for evaluation of the 16 ke y family practices, protocols were being developed to measure their impact. The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R8 on this item. Extension of Social Protection in Health: Joint Initiative of the Pan American health Organization and the Inte rnational Labour Organization (Document CE130/14) Dr. Daniel L\u00f3pez Acu\u00f1a (Director, Di vision of Health Systems and Services Development, PAHO) gave an update on a joint initiative being undertaken by PAHO and the International Labour Organization (ILO) to promot e equitable access to health services in Latin America and the Caribbean, in particular for persons working in the informal segment of the economy and others wh o currently lacked ad equate health care coverage. The fundamental challenge faced by the health systems of countries in the Region was that of ascertaining how to gua rantee all citizens a ba sic level of social protection in health that would contribute to the elimination of disparities in access to quality basic services and also provide excluded social groups the opportunity to obtain essential health care services that met their n eeds and demands, regard less of their ability to pay. The rationale for the initiative incl uded the persistence of economic, ethnic and cultural exclusion; the inadequacy of exis ting mechanisms of social protection for responding to new problems; and the dictate th at reforms should lead to societies that were inclusive of all citizens and not to gr eater exclusion, marginalization, and lack of social protection. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 32 \"Social protection in health\" was define d not as the actual provision of heath services, physical construction of health f acilities, etc., but as society's guarantee, through the different public auth orities, that indivi duals or groups of i ndividuals would be able to meet their health needs through adeq uate access to health services, whether by way of a national health system or some othe r system, regardless of ability to pay. Three conditions had to be met to guarantee social protection in health : access to health services, financial security of the family, a nd dignity in the provision of care. Document CE130/14 identified factors that led to excl usion in health\u2014notably poverty\u2014and the main obstacles to extending soci al protection. It also discus sed the scale of exclusion in health and explained the difficu lty of measuring it. It iden tified several strategies for extending social protection in health, based on inte rventions that had proven effective in the past in Latin American and Caribbean countries. These included establishment of special social security regimes without be neficiary contribution requirements; voluntary, government-subsidized insurance schemes; limite d expansion of the pply of services; systems of social protec tion; and gradual deve lopment of unified health systems, combining public and private subsystems. The document proposed four lines of acti on relating to the steering role, financing of social protection, health in surance, and service delivery. As relevant stakeholders frequently belonged to sectors other than heal th\u2014such as finance, social policy, labor and employment, education, industry, etc.\u2014it wa s important to develop a participatory process at the national level, involving all su ch key stakeholders. Th at process would lead to the formulation of a national strategy and a national plan of action for extending social protection in health. At th e regional level, PAHO and the ILO would support the countries through a variety of activities, including promo tion and publicizing of the initiative, identification of the causes and magni tude of exclusion and ways to combat it, establishment of a clearinghouse of inform ation on best practices and knowledge, and mobilization of resources. The Executive Committee welcomed the update on the joint initiative, which was described as a valuable tool in support of the efforts of many countries to improve access to health services for all members of th eir populations, particularly the poor, the marginalized, and the vulnerable. Delegates applauded the multisectoral approach laid out in the document and its r ecognition that the issue of soci al protection related not only to health but also to housing, education, the environmen t, and many other factors. The Committee was pleased, too, to see the emph asis placed on cultural sensitivity and dignity in medical care. Delegates made a number of suggesti ons for enhancing the document. One was the incorporation of case studi es of programs and initiatives that had been successful in improving delivery of health services to unprotected population groups, both within and outside the Region. One delegate asked for cl arification of the methodologies used to CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 33 reach the figures cited on exclusion from so cial protection and cau tioned against the use of indicators that attempted to measure ex clusion only in terms of demand for health services, since the latter was influenced by multiple factors, including cultural perceptions about health and illness and economic and soci al issues. Clarification of the respective roles and contributi ons of PAHO and the ILO in the initiative was also requested. The Committee sought more detailed in formation on how certain insurance systems described had worked, and in which countries they had been successful. There was a call for further discussion on the precis e actions by countries and the Organization that were being recommended, as well as on the counterpart contribution expected from the countries. The document was thought to be unclear on whether extension of social protection was being portrayed as a goal of th e health system or as a means of achieving better health outcomes. Further clarificati on was also sought on whether and how the social protection approach related to WHO's work in terms of health systems performance and the development of indicators of financial fairness and responsiveness. Some delegates felt that the document di d not clearly articulate the relationship between current reforms in the health sector \u2014which many countries in the Americas had undertaken as a way of extending coverage \u2014and the concept and the components of social protection. Further conceptual work wa s needed to define, measure, and evaluate the current status of social protection and exclusion in the Region. A series of pilot initiatives might be advisable before a full-scale initiative was launched based on predetermined mechanisms. A further sugges tion was to add some discussion of the implications of the various models presented on the labor market, and on competitiveness in particular, in the context of globalization and international competition. There was also a call for a discussion on the sustainability of the various models, in particular in relation to any potential conflict with other components of social security, such as pensions. One delegate felt that the statement \"service delivery is where the population's health needs are met\" might not be comple tely accurate, as a popul ation's health needs could be met through a variety of approach es, including community-based approaches, safe water, and sanitation, other public health programs, and improved individual behaviors or healthier habits. Additionally, th e document's assertion that social protection was to be understood as a guara ntee by the State of a right th at its citizens could exercise might not necessarily apply in all cases. Wh ile many countries' c onstitutions enshrined the right of citizens to health and the responsibility of the gov ernment to ensure that right, access to health services was not viewed as a fundamental right by all legal systems. While the cooperation between PAHO and th e ILO might be useful in undertaking actions of technical cooperation for the countries , in carrying out studies or research, or in making recommendations, the fact remained that every country had its own situation, its CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 34 own rules and its own philosophy, and had to s eek its own solutions to the issues of access to, or exclusion from, heath care. It was pointed out that migration of health care professionals was having a devastating effect on some countries' ability to provide care. Since the problem related directly to both access to heal th care and labor, it might be a ppropriate to address it in the framework of the joint PAHO/I LO initiative. It was also suggested that the Governing Bodies might wish to examine the issue of health workforce migration as a separate agenda item at some future time. Several delegates described initiatives that were being pursued in their own countries in the broad area of th e extension of social protecti on in health. Most laid stress on the need for close cooperation between minist ries of health and of labor, with some also mentioning the need for involvement by the ministry of the environment. Several delegates also described related conferences, meetings, and seminars on the topic that had taken place in their countries. Dr. L\u00f3pez Acu\u00f1a expressed his thanks for the suggested enrichments to the document. He explained that extension of social protection in health was both a part of a target\u2014namely the improvement of universal access to health care\u2014and a very important instrument for achieving improved results, by facilitating access to care and enhancing its effectiveness and appropriateness. In response to the calls for case studies and greater detail, he noted that PAHO a nd the ILO were working on a background paper that would be much more detailed than Document CE130/14. He agreed with the suggestion that the methodology to study exclusi on could not be designed using just one indicator, as exclusion was influenced by ge ographic, cultural, li nguistic, and many other factors. With regard to the questions on the role s of the two organizations, he explained that PAHO worked with the ILO in many ar eas, such as occupational health and the management and planning of human resources. The joint work on extension of social protection in health was one more such area. Both PAHO and the ILO had been allocating resources for three years from th eir respective regular budgets. In addition, resources had been donated by Belgium, Fr ance, Sweden, and the European Union. He reported that outside funding, notably from Sweden, had b een used to conduct pilot studies with a view to characterizing excl usion from the point of view of various indicators. That work would continue, along with some initial steps towards social dialogue to identify strategies to cover populations with in adequate access to health services, particularly those in the informal economy. There had also been a very thorough analysis, taking more than a year, of co mparative assessments of micro-insurance schemes, comparative analysis of prem iums, and the behavior of out-of-pocket expenditure. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 35 He stressed that convergence had b een sought with hea lth sector reform initiatives. It was to be h oped that, with the paradigm of synergy that PAHO and the ILO sought to promote, resources could be mob ilized and added to the relatively modest levels utilized so far. The Director said that PAHO was ve ry sensitive to th e need for basing requirements on demand. Much of the discu ssion with the ILO had been on that very point. Studies had shown clearly that any metr ic of demand was really a bottomless pit, and that it would never be possible fully to satisfy the demands of the population for health services. The comments from delegate s had pointed out very clearly that one should look at some measure of need, which ra ised a very difficult question, namely, how to estimate need in terms of the persons w ho were socially excluded. However difficult, it would be essential to find methodologies to do that. In regard to the issue of whether or not social protection was a right, he noted that the right to health had long been recognized in the Region. In the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, all the countries of the Americas had affirmed that every person had the right to those sanitary and social measures necessary to preserve health. At the same time, PAHO certainly recognized that there were fundamentally different systems in different countries a nd that allowance had to be made for the particular flavor of the local social and economic reality. The Secretariat would try to make the document clearer in that regard. He wished to reassure the Committee th at there was no contradiction between the work of PAHO as described in the documen t and what was happening at WHO. There might possibly be some conceptual differenc es in relation to health systems, but fundamentally it was agreed that the essent ial purpose of health systems was to improve health outcomes. PAHO could collaborate with the ILO in three basic ways: it could provide an analysis of the s ituation; it could facilitate technical cooperation and the sharing of experiences among countries; and it could undertake aggressive advocacy for consideration of the topi c of social exclusion. One of the key problems in the issue of social exclus ion was economic instability. Three basic reasons had led to economic inst ability and increased the degree of social exclusion in the countries of the Region: the slump of the 1980s, which had gravely affected the middle class and seriously di minished the State's capacity to gather contributions towards social security; the countries' high macro-economic volatility; and the inadequate response by social and political institutions. On the question of migration of health care professionals, PAHO was aware of what the Commonwealth Secretariat was doing and also of the activities of the CARICOM countries, which had agreed to launch a process of managing migration. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 36 There was a growing feeling in some circles th at it was time to look at the migration of health personnel in a different light, recognizing that it could have positive returns. In Jamaica, for example, remittances from Jamaicans who had left their homeland accounted for 8%-9% of GDP. One way of a ddressing the personnel shortages created by migration might be to expand the scale of medi cal training so that it was sufficient both to meet the country's own needs and also to provide for the \"export\" of trained medical personnel. In any case, it was no longer hereti cal to think of a pos itive return from migration. The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R9 on this item. Health and Aging (Document CE130/15) Dr. Martha Pel\u00e1ez (Regional Advisor on Aging and Health, PAHO) presented an analysis of priorities to advance health a nd well-being into old age and proposals for the implementation of necessary actions to ensure equity in health for older persons, as outlined in Document CE130/15. The document al so discussed the demographic situation of the Americas, in which all countries were experiencing populati on aging. By the year 2025, it was estimated that the population aged 60 and over woul d number around 200 million, and that about half of that population would reside in Latin America and the Caribbean. The growth in the number of olde r adults threatened to result in economic insecurity and health inequities. There wa s a danger that family and social supports would prove inadequate to th e situation, entailing risks of age discrimination and other violations of basic human rights. However, su ch a crisis could be averted by taking action now and investing in the hea lth of older persons to prom ote active and healthy aging. PAHO's technical cooperation in the area of aging and he alth was aimed at enabling countries to prepare and res pond to the challenges and opport unities created by an aging population and at supporting thei r efforts to implement the In ternational Plan of Action on Aging which had been adopted by the S econd World Assembly on Aging, held in Madrid earlier in the year. The International Plan of Action established three priority areas for action: encouraging participatio n of older persons in developmen t, enhancing their health and well-being, and ensuring enabling and suppor tive environments for them. Document CE130/15 proposed a comprehensive and coordi nated system of care, laid down six principles that should underlie such a system, and set out several strategies for creating it, including the establishment of health promotion targets for older persons; the reorienting of primary care for the prevention and mana gement of aging-dependent diseases and conditions; integrating social and health care services to promote a continuum of support for older persons in danger of losing au tonomy; and developing partnerships for information sharing, technical collaboration, and support. It al so considered the financial resources needed, and put forward some ke y issues for deliberation. The Committee was CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 37 asked to discuss ways in which the policy a nd action framework of the regional strategy for technical collaboration on aging and heal th could be enhanced, and examine future approaches to health promotion and aging; discuss and endorse necessary strategies for closing the equity gap in aging and health; and provide support for mobilizing international resources that would allow fo r appropriate implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging. The Executive Committee considered the document a good framework for addressing the health needs of a rapidly ag ing population in the Region. Conceptually, it embraced a model of health and aging that was comprehensive and coordinated, both within the health sect or and across other sectors that c ontributed to good he alth status and sustainable health services. The Second Wo rld Assembly on Aging had provided an opportunity for countries to reexamine aging at the national and international levels and to reaffirm their commitment to improving the lives of older persons, and the Committee was pleased to see that PAHO was working on applying the outcome of that Assembly to the Region. Some delegates cautioned, how ever, against drafting a further lengthy document on the topic. Instead, PAHO should work with countries towards the development of a list of common priorities fo r the Region and specific measurable steps that could be taken to improve the health and well-being of th e older population. The Delegate of Canada welcomed the extent to which the document had drawn upon \"A Guide for the Development of a Comp rehensive System of Support to Promote Active Ageing,\" which had been produced jointly by Mexico and Canada. It was suggested that the section in the document on \"Access to Appropriate Health and Long Term Care Services\" should give greater attention to the development of community-based supportive housing or assisted indepe ndent living options, which had been found in some countries to be a co st-effective alternative to institutionalization. It was also suggested that injury preven tion and control should be included among the health promotion targets in the section on strategies, as research indicated that unintentional injuries, es pecially falls, were the single mo st important preventable cause of hospitalization and long-term di sability among older adults. Under section 3.3.1 \"Establish Health Pr omotion Targets for Older Persons,\" it was suggested that anxiety and depression should be considered as mental health outcomes rather than as risk factors. Among the major ri sk factors for anxiety and depression were social isola tion, poverty and disabling physi cal conditions. It was felt that dementia should not be included under the heading of \"What can be done,\" since dementia was not amenable to prevention or treatment in the same way as anxiety and depression. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 38 Several delegates stressed the importance of taking a broad view of the direct impact that an improvement or deterioration in the health status of a particular population might have upon the health outcomes of anot her population. The linkages between health and aging and issues such as chronic dis eases and health care reform were also highlighted. A number of delegates describe d the work that was being done in their countries on the topic of heath and aging. It was pointed out that the impact of th e issues of health and aging varied across the Region, since the various countries ha d different rates of mortality and life expectancies, different proportions of older people in the po pulation as a w hole, and so on. At the same time, the topic was not just a question of reducing mortality or increasing life expectancy, it was also, and essentially, a question of the quality of life that could be offered to the populations of older adults. The issue had two major aspects: on the one hand, that relating to health pr omotion and specific types of health protection for older people, and, on the other hand, that relating to monitoring and regul ating residential and other facilities for them. Without such regul ation and supervision, there was a risk of serious violations of older persons' human right s, particularly where such persons did not have the support of a family environment. Th ere was a need for an overall, integrated approach, but at the same time, countries needed to be able to select those features which were appropriate to their indi vidual demographic situation. Monitoring and evaluating research was seen as an important role for PAHO. Ministries of health in the countries needed to have adequate evid ence of the impacts of national health promotion in itiatives, programs, and policies, and PAHO's technical cooperation could help them collect the nece ssary data to determine those impacts. Dr. Pel\u00e1ez thanked the delegates fo r their comments and for their vote of confidence in the program. She was particularly grateful for the specific suggestions of particular areas in which the content of th e document could be improved, notably in the areas of mental health and community care. Noting that current development of initia tives on aging was la rgely in the hands of the private sector, she referred to the n eed to determine the form that collaboration between the public and the privat e sectors would take. That was relevant in particular to the issues of monitoring and regu lation of facilities for older people. She agreed that there was a need for close coor dination on the ground between the programs on aging and those on chronic diseases, as well as between health and aging and health care reform, and that the overall issue was not only incr eased longevity but also the human rights of older people. Recalling that research into the issues had taken the form of the four-year multicenter Study on Aging, Well-being, and Health (SABE) of older adu lts, she said that CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 39 the results from SABE had enabled PAHO to focus its technical cooperation more effectively. PAHO was fully prepared to provi de those results to the various countries, continuing to provide support to them as they carried out their own research. The Committee adopted Reso lution CE130.R19 on this item. Regional Strategy for Maternal Mo rtality and Morbidity Reduction (Document CE130/16) Dr. Virginia Camacho (Regional A dvisor, Maternal Mortality Reduction Initiative, PAHO) presented an overview of PAHO's approach for reducing maternal mortality and morbidity. Maternal mortality cont inued to be an area of public health in which little progress was being achieved, a lthough there was ample knowledge of the causes of maternal death and appropriate, ev idence-based interventions for resource-poor settings existed. It was known, fo r example, that vast majority of maternal deaths were due to direct obstetric causes, even in countri es with low maternal mortality rates; 80% of all post-partum deaths occurred in the first week after childbirth; 15% of birthing women had a serious complication; and 1%-2% of birthing women needed a major obstetrical intervention to survive. Other lessons learne d were that a long-term political commitment was essential to reduce maternal mortality; th at every pregnancy faced risk and therefore every pregnancy required skilled attendance at delivery; that the quality and coverage of care had to be improved; that contraceptive options had to be increased, ensuring their availability and use; and that it was a dvantageous to delay the first birth. History had shown that the key to reduci ng maternal mortality lay not solely in general social and economic development, but also in making effective treatment available and accessible. A WHO study, for example, had demonstrated a strong correlation between low maternal mortality rates and skilled attendance at birth. Therefore, PAHO was currently promoting a more focused approach, concentrating on such cost-effective interventions as essentia l obstetric care (EOC) and improved access to quality maternal health care services. The regional strategy for maternal mortality and morbidity reduction was designed to translate the lessons learned into action. The strategy sought to promote effective public policies and gui delines at the national and m unicipal levels; promote best practices and evidence-based interventions, not ably essential obstetric care and skilled attendance at birth; increase community interventions and participation; build partnerships and coalitions; strengthen maternal mortality and morbidity surveillance systems; finance maternal and perinatal health services within heal th sector reform; and increase investment in maternal and pe rinatal health promotion interventions. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 40 The interventions advocated under the st rategy had already been shown to work. In one district in Ecuador, for example, sk illed attendance at birt h had increased 80% in three years, and in Honduras had succeeded in reducing its maternal mortality rate 40% in the past seven years. With concerted effort , it would surely be possible to achieve the goal of reducing maternal death rates to below 100 per 100,000 live births in all countries of the Region and close the maternal mortal ity gap between and within countries. The Executive Committee applauded the document and welcomed the changes made following the SPP's discussion of an earli er draft. The document now focused more on deciding interventions on an individual basis, taking into consideration past evidence and best practices, as well as risk assessment specific to each individual pregnancy. The disproportionately high ma ternal death rates among poor and underprivileged women were considered one of the most egregious manifestations of inequity in health, especially since the vast ma jority of such deaths were preventable. The Committee stressed that improving the situation should be a major publ ic health priority of all governments. It was pointed out that the maternal mort ality rate was not only a health indicator, but also an important development indicato r. The problems that contributed to high maternal death rates had to be tackled by the community as a whole. One delegate reported that a community-based initiative designed to identify pregnant women and ensure that they received adequate prenat al care had proved extremely effective in reducing maternal mortality in his country. Another argument for community involvement was that a signi ficant proportion of pregnant women were without the support of their male partners during or after pregnancy. Male partners should also be the targets of education and health promotion cam paigns aimed at fostering safe motherhood. Various delegates highlighted the need for training, adequate interinstitutional cooperation, and, above all, a multisectoral ap proach. Such an approach should address socioeconomic factors, employment, and the ed ucational challenges that women faced in addition to their health and nutritional needs. It was emphasized that poverty reduction and education were crucial strategies, as the majority of maternal deaths occurred among the poorest women with the leas t schooling. Attention to the h ealth and nutritional status of girls well before they re ached childbearing age was also critical for reducing risks and improving pregnancy outcomes. Improving the quality of care was also cons idered critical in order to eliminate inequalities, such as those that often exis ted between urban centers and remote rural areas, which tended to show higher rates of mo rtality. In regard to quality of care and access to services, delegates noted that those most at risk for complications were often from the disadvantaged socioeconomic strata . Consequently, even where services were ultimately reimbursed, many women would be less likely to access them because they CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 41 were unable to afford the initial out-of-poc ket expenses. The issue of financing posed perhaps the greatest challenge to the provision of universal a ccess to health care for the poor and marginalized women in the Americas . There should be a continuing focus on developing innovative strategies for sust ainable financing and improved access. Several suggestions were made fo r improving the document. Concern was expressed about the phrase \"every pregnanc y faced risk,\" which was perhaps overly broad and might exaggerate the degree of risk. It was suggest ed that Section 2.1, \"Current Situation of Maternal Morbidity and Mortal ity,\" should focus more on other causes of maternal death, as only adolescent pregnancy was discussed in depth. It would be useful to have a similarly detailed discussion of the other fact ors and how they could be prevented. Several delegates s ought clarification on some of the figures presented in the document and offered to supply more recent data and methodological information on surveillance of maternal mortality. One delegate expressed the view that the phrase \"reproductive health services\" in the international context now had the connota tion of abortion servi ces and recommended that it should be changed to \"reproductive heal th care,\" so as not to give the impression that the document was in any way promoting abortion in the Region. As the document pointed out that unsafe abortions were contributors to matern al mortality in a number of countries, it should also reflect an empha sis on preventing abortion, especially by reducing unplanned pregnancies. Other de legates felt that the document focused excessively on EOC to the exclusion of othe r strategies such as prevention, education, and antenatal care, particularly addressing sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and recourse to unsafe abortion. It was pointed out that much of the doc ument referred only to maternal mortality, with little attention to morbidity. Women's high burden of illness and disability due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth or un safe abortions needed to be an explicit part of all maternal heal th programs and policies. Dr. Camacho expressed her appreciati on for the Committee's useful comments and suggestions, which would be reflected in the revised version of the document. She welcomed the delegates' expressions of co mmitment to the issue and thanked those who had offered to provide more up-to-date or detailed data. The Director said that the high levels of maternal mortality in the Region were one of his greatest concerns. When one looke d at the advances made in reducing child mortality, one had to ask why similar progre ss had not been made on maternal mortality, especially since many of the i ssues that needed to be addr essed were the same: poverty, development, education. Perhaps part of the problem was a reluctance in the countries of CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 42 the Region to acknowledge that the problem really existed. If so, it had to be brought out into the open. As the document made clear, the nece ssary technologies were available; the question was how to galvanize the countries into applying them. He clarified that the emphasis on EOC did not mean that other activities were not equally important. A multifactorial approach was essential. In th e countries where maternal mortality rates were highest, specific interventions should be applied, while rec ognizing that in the countries with lower rates a wi der spectrum of activ ities would be requi red to bring about an improvement. The Committee adopted Reso lution CE130.R10 on this item. Public Health Response to Chronic Diseases (Document CE130/17) Dr. Sylvia Robles (Coordinator, Progr am on Noncommunicable Diseases, PAHO) described the public health approach deve loped by PAHO to addres s the growing burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the Region. That approach combined population-based risk management to prev ent NCDs with primary care models for responding to both acute and chronic health needs. Although they continued to be perceived as diseases of affluence, ch ronic noncommunicable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases, were now leading cause s of premature death a nd disability in all countries of the Americas. They also exacted a tremendous social and economic toll, as they tended to affect adults during their most productive year s, thereby depriving families of their principal wage-earne rs. Their impact on the poor in developing countries was especially severe. Moreover, chronic diseases themselves could lead to poverty, as the cost of treatment was often exorbitant. It wa s therefore imperative to find sustainable, cost-effective strategies for preventing these diseases. A key component of the regional appro ach was Actions for the Multifactorial Reduction of Noncommunicable Diseases, a network of community-based programs, known by its Spanish-language acronym, CARMEN . A related initiativ e in the Caribbean was the Caribbean Lifestyle Intervention Pr ogram (CARLI). CARMEN was based on the concept of integrated action aimed at reducing a set of risk factors common to many noncommunicable diseases. CARMEN and CARL I shared three elements common to all successful programs for NCD disease preventi on and control: (1) policy-building to address macro-level determinants of NC Ds, (2) community-based action; and (3) responsive health services. CA RMEN was one of the six regional networks operating in each of the WHO regions. Those networks offered opportunities for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, exchanging experiences between countries, and training. Other components of the PAHO strategy were surveillance of NCDs and risk factors, innovative models for delivering care for chronic conditions, and advocacy for policy CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 43 change. The document provided information on the activities envisaged in each of those areas. The Executive Committee was aske d to comment on how PAHO might strengthen its public health approach to chronic NCDs, especially through the CARMEN initiative, and assist Member States in grappling with the double burden of communicable diseases and noncommunicable diseases. The Committee endorsed the public health approach presented in the document and applauded PAHO's efforts to help the c ountries deal with chronic noncommunicable diseases, which were an increasingly bur densome problem for both developed and developing countries in the Re gion. The Committee stressed the need for prevention to reduce the occurrence of chronic NCDs and thus also reduce their staggering economic and social costs. To prevent these diseases it was essential to address the risk factors that contributed to their occurrence. To do that , however, it was necessary to determine what the risk factors were, which pointed up the need for research and increased investment in research. Studies should look at the whole range of behavi oral, environmental, dietary, and other factors that might play a role in the development of chronic NCDs. Health promotion and education were also crucia l in order to convince people to change potentially harmful behaviors and equip them with the knowledge they needed to take greater responsibility for their own health. Rese arch was also needed in the area of health promotion and education to identify the most effective interventions. The Committee saw such research as a key technica l cooperation ro le for PAHO. CARMEN was considered a highly effective vehicle for preventing disease and promoting health, as it offered an integrated approach for addressing chronic NCDs and their common risk factors. Another a dvantage of CARMEN was its emphasis on community participation and multisectoral action, which were essential components of any successful program to prevent chronic NCDs. It was suggested that the document should provide more detailed information on the CARMEN initiativ e and on strategies for reducing common risk factors. The Committee pointed out that, as in th e case of HIV/AIDS and other diseases linked to risk, health promotion efforts must target not only individuals but also their families and society as a whole, so as to bring about a cultural change and foster environments that discouraged unhealthy and risky behaviors. The Representative of the Inter-American Development Bank reported th at a joint initiative of PAHO and the IDB had borne out the need to heighten public aw areness of the risk factors for chronic NCDs and create a culture of prevention in which people accepted the need to take certain measures to prevent chronic noncommunicable di seases, just as they accepted the need to get immunized to protect themselves from vaccine-preventable diseases. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 44 Several delegates again noted the linkag e between chronic NCDs and the subject of health and aging and felt that it should be highlighted more prominently in the documents on both items. One delegate pointed out that this item was also linked to the item on IMCI, since action taken to prevent health problems in childhood woul d also help prevent health problems later in life. Th rough health education, children must be prevented from taking up smoking and other unh ealthy habits that could lead to chronic NCDs and they must be encouraged to exercise and adopt healthy lifestyles. Noting that the document did not men tion the global strategy currently being formulated by WHO on diet, phys ical activity, and health fo r the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases, one delegate ur ged PAHO to become actively involved in the strategy's development. PAHO had provided a valuab le forum for discussion and input by Member States on other major globa l strategic initiatives, such as those on health system performance and infant and young child feeding. It was important for the Organization to play that role again in the case of the global strategy on NCDs. The delegate also urged Member States to subm it their comments on the draft report of the expert consultation organized by WHO a nd the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations on diet, nutrition, and prevention of chronic diseases, as the recommendations contained in that report woul d form the basis for the global strategy. Dr. Robles emphasized that PAHO's stra tegy employed an in tegrated approach that took account of both the chronic noncommunicable diseases and their associated risk factors. As the delegates had observed, CA RMEN offered the opportunity to integrate actions and ensure the sustainability of NC D prevention and control initiatives. It also provided a framework for international colla boration and for evalua ting the effectiveness and impact of interventions. She agreed on the importance of risk prevention that targeted the family and the community because risk factors had a component that was socially constructed. Moreover, families could fac ilitate prevention starting in childhood and throughout the life cycle. For that reason, family and community action were a key component of PAHO's public health appro ach, along with public policy-building and responsive health services. The Director agreed on the need to address NCDs throughout lifecycle. Disease prevention and health promotion should star t in childhood and even before birth, since there was strong evidence that intrauterine conditions influenced a person's proclivity towards chronic diseases later in life. Hen ce, promoting maternal health could be a preventive measure for reducing the prevalence of chronic diseases. He also agreed that health promotion st rategies should target society as a whole. However, while population-based interventi ons were imperative in some cases, interventions directed towa rds individuals were also necessary. He hoped that the document made it clear that the two approach es were in no way antagonistic. In some CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 45 instances, the state must take action to reduce or eliminate factors that posed a risk for the population\u2014e.g., measures to reduce the risk of tobacco use. But it was also important to focus on changing individual behaviors. Regarding the draft report of the WHO/ FAO expert consultation, he had not had the opportunity to read the doc ument in depth. After he had done so, he would be in a position to confer with the Member States as to whether a consultation at the regional level would be appropriate and useful to help further work in regard to development of the global strategy on noncommunicable diseases. He was pleased that the Committee had brought up the subject of research, which was an important aspect of PAHO's approach to NCDs. At present, the Organization was sponsoring a multicenter research project aimed at determining how groups and individuals could best be pers uaded to change their behavior and at what stage they would be most receptive to health promo tion messages. Information on the project had not been included in Document CE130/17 b ecause the working documents submitted to the Governing Bodies were intentionally kept brief. However, in revising the document for the Conference, the Secretariat would tr y to incorporate more information about research and about CARMEN, an initiative of which the Organization was very proud. The Committee adopte d Resolution CE130.R13. Women, Health, Dr. Marijke (Coord inator, Women, Health, and Development, PAHO) described her program's work to bridge the health and gender gap in the Americas. In keeping with PAHO's defi nition of inequity, ge nder inequities were defined as those inequalities between men and women that were unnecessary, preventable, and unjust. Gender equity in health did not necessarily mean that men and women would have the same mortality and morbid ity rates, but it did mean that they had equal opportunity to enjoy health and to avoid becoming ill or disabled or dying prematurely from preventable causes. It also meant that health resources were allocated according to the differential needs of men and women, irrespective of their ability to pay, and that men and women contributed to health care financing according to their economic capacity, not their health and reproductive health risks. There was increasing evidence that gender in equities affected health status, access to health services, and the quality of care r eceived. The impact of gender inequities on women's health status was evident, for example, in the Region's unacceptably high maternal mortality rates and in the gender-based violence that affected more than 1 in 3 women. Gender inequities also interacted with and were exacerbated by poverty, education, and ethnicity. Excess female mort ality was much highe r among poor women. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 46 Throughout their lifetime, women tended to use health services more than men as a result of their reproductive role and longer life span. However, poor women used services less than men and spent more out-of-pocket for hea lth care. Gender inequities also affected the provision of health care. While women ma de up 80% of the health care workforce, they worked mainly in low-income, low-pres tige jobs. Furthermore, much of women's contribution to health in their fam ilies and communities was unremunerated. PAHO's Program on Women, Health, and Development had been established to assist Member States in achie ving gender equity in health. Based on that mandate and the needs of Member States, the Program had id entified five strategic areas for action: (1) including a gender perspective in health situation analysis to target policies and programs more effectively; (2) monitoring th e effect of health policies and reform processes related to gender equity in hea lth; (3) developing a nd implementing models that addressed gender inequities in health in an integrated manner; (4) supporting outreach activities with information, edu cation, and communication strategies and materials for advocacy and trai ning; and (5) mainstreaming the gender perspective in the policies and programs of PAHO and Member States. The document outlined the principal activities of the Program in each of those areas and presented a series of actions which the Program recommended Member States take to bridge the gender gap. Those recommendations were based on the commitments assumed by the countries under the various gl obal and regional c onventions on women's rights and women's health, as well as the recommendations of PAHO's Subcommittee on Women, Health, and Development. In the discussion that followed Dr. Velzeboer's presentation, Members of the Committee welcomed the revisions made to the document since the SPP's consideration of an earlier version, especially those that clarified the meaning of \"gender equity\" and related terminology. It was suggested, however , that the statement that \"payment for health services is made according to ec onomic ability\" somewhat contradicted the assertion that gender equity meant that men and women received health services according to their differential needs and irresp ective of their ability to pay. It was also suggested that the document should focus mo re on the Program's concrete achievements to date, its ongoing work, and its future priori ties. The document's attention to the mental health needs of women was applauded, but it was felt that the issue should not be mentioned only in the context of violence against women. The Delegate of Canada offered her count ry's expertise to a ssist the Program in compiling and analyzing sex-disaggregated data. Dr. Velzeboer-Salcedo thanked the Canadian Delegate for her offer. She reported that, since the last session of the Subcom mittee on Women, Health, and Development, CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 47 the Program had recruited a staff member w ith expertise in gender analysis, which had enhanced its capacity to collaborate with the countries in that area. Regarding the suggestions on the document, she said it been intended to provide a broad picture of what the Program had achieved and where it planne d to go in the future, emphasizing how the Program could assist the countries. It had therefore not included much detail about concrete achievements, but th e Program would try to includ e more concrete information in the next version. As for future priorities, the strategic areas identified in the document represented the priority areas in which the Pr ogram would be concentr ating its efforts in the coming years. In response to the comments concerning me ntal health, she expl ained that it was mentioned explicitly in the section on ge nder-based violence because sometimes the Program's work in that area was incorporated into the mental health department of the health ministries in the ten countries in which the model for addressing gender-based violence had been implemented. The aim wa s to utilize the community-based networks established under the model to also address me ntal health and other primary health care needs of women. In El Salvador, for exampl e, several community-based networks were already working on mental health problems in addition to their work with regard to gender-based violence. The Committee adopted Reso lution CE130.R14 on this item. Evaluation of the Pan American Center fo r Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences (CEPIS) (Document CE130/19) Mr. Roberto Rivero (Office of Analysis and Strategic Pla nning, PAHO) reported that the Director of the Pan American San itary Bureau had requested PAHO's Office of Analysis and Strategic Planning, to conduct a broad-based evaluation of the relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Pan Am erican Center for Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences (CEPIS). It was hoped that in the process, an evaluation model would be developed that could be applied to other Centers of the Organization. The Director had asked the evaluation team to addr ess four main issues: whether the original rationale for PAHO's operating the Center was still valid; the nature of the working relations among CEPIS and PAHO's country offi ces, and whether those relations resulted in actual synergies; the medium and l ong-term financial outlook for CEPIS and suggestions on how it could be improved; and whether the merger of resources from the former Pan American Center for Human Ecol ogy and Health (ECO) into CEPIS had been effective. The key issues identified by the Dir ector coalesced around three evaluation questions: whether CEPIS was delivering effective, releva nt, useful, high-quality, technical cooperation which contributed to improving environmental health in the CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 48 Americas; whether CEPIS was well managed; a nd whether the merger of some resources from the former ECO with CEPIS had create d the intended synergies. Those questions had been addressed through a detail ed analysis of material and Center data; an analysis of a sample of CEPIS project files, and intervie ws with CEPIS staff, key stakeholders in Peru, PAHO Headquarters staff and othe r Regional experts, and surveys. The evaluation had produced four ma in conclusions. Firstly, CEPIS was perceived as a valuable source of technica l cooperation. However, it should adapt its present role and functions so as to be more proactive and work more through networks of institutions, which would have a multiplier e ffect on its technical cooperation. Secondly, CEPIS should seek to transform itself in to a catalyst organization, as had been recommended by the 1998 Special Advisory Group. This would mean that the CEPIS planning, programming, and budgeting process would have to find a better way to distribute available regular budget resources. Thirdly, CEPIS should develop an appropriate resource mobilization strategy, as well as a permanent internal capacity for resource mobilization. That would require ad ditional funding, to be achieved either by a redirection of CEPIS resources or by add itional funding approved by the Director of PAHO. Fourthly, the merger of two differe nt technological cu ltures\u2014CEPIS and the former ECO\u2014as well as the construction of a \"new\" CEPIS was still a work in progress which deserved the support of an external advisory body. In addition, the evaluation had produced 19 recommendations in the areas of effectiveness and the CEPIS-ECO merger. The Executive Committee commended the Secretariat on the quality of both the summary document and the full evaluation report. The Committee felt that the information contained in the report was very valuable in making the Member States more cognizant of the important role played by the Ce nters. It also consid ered the involvement of the external auditor to have been highly beneficial. It was suggested that one or two such evaluations per year should be carried out and their results communicated to the Governing Bodies. It was pointed out that the fundamental ques tion to be addressed in an evaluation of such a center was whether and to what extent it was contributing to the achievement of the plans and programs of the Organization and its Member States. Any recommendations for changes should be seen in the same light. Delegates cautioned that as the report its elf pointed out, the report was subject to some internal bias due to the heavy reli ance on stakeholder surveys and interviews. Additionally, the evaluation methodology could have been improved by the addition of quantitative measures. Nevertheless, the result s were useful as a tool to enhance the accountability and responsiveness of the Center, and full implementation of the evaluation team's recommendations would bri ng improvements in the Center's capacity. Support was expressed, in particular, for th e recommendation that CEPIS should play a more proactive and forecasting role and should guide Member States in the utilization of environmental health assessments. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 49 While the degree of dislocation that ha d occurred following the merger with ECO was relatively normal and would probably be resolved in due course, it had to be asked whether it was realistic to expect CEPIS to accommodate all the needs of all the countries of the Region. Perhaps there should be al liances with, for example, the Caribbean Environmental Health Institute in Saint Lu cia, thus permitting greater involvement by countries located far away from CEPIS. The Delegate of Jamaica reported that CARICOM, with the assistance of PAHO, wa s currently undertaki ng a review of the regional institutions operating within the CARICOM area, including the Caribbean Environmental Health Institute. He would not ru le out some form of merger of functions or alliance with CEPIS, but that that was a ma tter to be considered when the evaluations were completed. It was suggested that, since the report did acknowledge some significant weaknesses in the Center, before the topic wa s presented to the Pan American Sanitary Conference, an addendum to the repor t might be produced to address the recommendations made, thus giving the full pict ure not only of the evaluation but also of how the Secretariat viewed the recommendati ons. Delegates identified five areas in which such additional information might be us eful: the merger with ECO and its failure to bring the desired synergies; the current lack of a financia l plan; the lack of a senior management team; the lack of a medium-ter m strategic plan; and the need for greater outreach to the English-speaking countries of the Region. Mr. Rivero thanked the Executive Committee for its comments. He pointed out that this was essentially an internal eval uation that had been designed on the basis of questions defined by the Director. The me thodology developed could probably also be used for evaluating other centers in the futu re, but he cautioned th at no two Centers are alike, and that if different questions we re posed, then the evaluation methodology might have to be changed accordingly. He agreed that it did appear that CEPIS' current structure and resource allocation needed to be reorganized. Given the current financing and internal resource allocation, the Center had almost reached its maximum potential for performance, and to advance and develop that potential it would be necessa ry to implement at l east some of the major recommendations. He also concurred with the suggestion of alliances with other centers such that, in the future, CEPIS functioned more as a hub of collaborating centers and institutions. The Director said that the results of an evaluation depended on the questions asked, as well as on the suitability of the ins titution for evaluation, plus the capacity of the available data to answer those particul ar questions. But with that caveat, then a general methodology could be developed, fo r use in future such evaluations. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 50 It should be remembered that while CE PIS had been evaluated as an individual center, in program terms it was a part of th e environmental health program as a whole, which also consisted of persons at Headquart ers and of environmenta l health specialists in the countries. When the possibilities for delivering technical cooperation in environmental health were considered, it was not right to expect th at CEPIS alone would perform that function. The reason for the merger of ECO and CEPIS had been to eliminate a divide between identification of risks in one place and determination of the response to those risks in a nother. In large m easure, CEPIS had been successful in combining those two functions, which wa s what he understood by a \"new\" CEPIS. However, once the responses to the risks were defined, the technical cooperation necessary to supply the answers at the count ry level did not devolve on CEPIS alone, but on the environmental health program as a whole. CEPIS' main responsibility was to fulf ill a regional mandate. It would never be able to respond to all of the individual requests for technical cooperation that might come from individual countries. Doing so was in pa rt the responsibility of the environmental health specialists in those countries. While it had been suggested in the re port that CEPIS should place more emphasis on mobilizing external resources, he noted th at at present half of the Center's funds already came from external resources. He did no t think it a good idea for a center to be so dependent on external resources that those resources dictated what the center was doing. The correct approach was for the center to ascertain what the Governing Bodies had declared should be done and then seek the resources to do it. The deadlines for preparation of docum ents meant that a detailed addendum responding to the recommendations could not be created, but he coul d certainly indicate how the Secretariat would respond to some of the managerial issues raised. For example, he would be setting up an Advisory Comm ittee as suggested to provide guidance on technical and policy aspects. He cautioned, however, that it was not possible to structure a financial plan or a medium-term strategic pl an for CEPIS that woul d be separate from those of the Division of Health and Envir onment. CEPIS was not an independent entity; it was a part of the environmenta l health program as a whole. He noted the suggestion that CEPIS needed to reach out to the Caribbean. That would occur when risks in environmental he alth pertaining to the Caribbean needed identification from CEPIS and when the solution to those risks fell within the competence of CEPIS. When that was not the case, th en response to environmental needs in the Caribbean had to be the responsibility of the Organization as a whole, including the Division of Health and Environment. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 51 The evaluation had been a useful exerci se and one that would contribute to strengthening environmental health in th e Region as a whole. However, before undertaking other such evaluations, it was necessa ry to be sure that the benefits to be gained would justify th e resources utilized. The Committee adopted Reso lution CE130.R15 on this item. Report on the Meeting of the Health and Environment Ministers of the Americas (HEMA) (Document CE 130/20) Dr. Mauricio Pard\u00f3n (Director, Division of Health and Environment) reported that the Meeting of the Health and Environment Mi nisters of the Americas (HEMA) had been held in Ottawa, Canada, on 4 and 5 March 2002. He explained that the meeting, which had grown out of the Quebec Summit in April 2001, and before that out of the Pan Amer ican Charter and Plan of Action signed at the Pan American Conference on Health and Environment in Sustainable Human Development in Washington in October 1995, ha d been organized by the Government of Canada in collaboration with PAHO and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). The technical documents for the meeti ng had been drafted after a review of the existing knowledge and a broad-based cons ultation with countri es and institutions, including the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the Organization of American States, and the European Cent er for Environment and Health/WHO. The meeting had been attended by representativ es of 31 countries, w hose delegations had included 14 ministers of health and 15 minister s of environment. Its objectives had been to build bridges between the health and environment sectors, reach agreement on cooperative activities an d contribute to the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg to be held in August 2002. He gave two examples of the benefits of holding such hemispheric meetings. Firstly, drinking water coverage in the Regi on had improved from 33%, or 69 million people, in the early 1960s, to 85%, or 420 m illion, at the present time. Secondly, the use of lead in gasoline had dropped from 27,000 t ons in 1990 to an estimated 5,000 tons in 2000, 15 countries in the Region had eliminated lead in gasoline, a nd the remainder had plans to phase it out. In both cases, the improvements had come about as a result of hemispheric meetings such as HEMA. The HEMA meeting had noted that diarrheal diseases and respiratory ailments continued to represent the prin cipal burden of disease linked with the environment. While recognizing that there were differences am ong countries, it had identified the common priority environmental health issues in the Region: first, water po llution, sanitation, and hygiene; second, indoor and outdoor air pollution ; and third, the chronic and acute effects CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 52 of exposure to chemical substances, pesticides in particular. There was agreement at the meeting, moreover, to consider ways of working towards meeting the Millennium Summit's goals with respect to water and sanitation and the reduction of water pollution, as outlined in the Declaration of Montreal 2001; solid waste management and the phasing out of lead in gasoline; implementing the St ockholm Convention; control of exposure to chemical substances; and reducing vulnerability to natural disasters. The participating countries had agreed on the need to m ove forward in the national arena with a broad-based strate gic partnership between the health and environment sectors and on the importance of capacity-building in the areas of surveillance, the use of indicators, inform ation exchange, institutional strengthening, and public information and education. Renewe d emphasis was placed on the Pan American Charter on Health and Environment in Sustai nable Human Development, recognizing the preeminence of action in each country. The Ministerial Communiqu\u00e9 that emerged from the meeting affirmed the ministers' agreement to meet periodically prior to the Summits of the Americas. It also called for the crea tion of a follow-up mechanism that would not duplicate but, rather, take a dvantage of existing regional and subregional capacities. Canada, PAHO, and UNEP would convene a Task Force to design that follow-up mechanism. It would work in the period 2002-2003 to define the type of actions that were required to implement the recommendations and conclusions of the HEMA meeting. It was suggested that the membership should comprise ten senior officials from the ministries of health and environment of perh aps five countries, regionally distributed. There would be two Co-Chairs, one from each ministry. The role of PAHO would be to work closely with the Co-Chairs to develop strategic materials and papers. Canada had generously offered to fund the firs t year of the Task Force's work. The Delegate of Canada thanked the Secr etariat for an excellent summary of the meeting, including the analysis of the outcomes and the resulting proposals for action. He expressed Canada's gratitude to PAHO for th e technical advice and support in planning for the meeting. He also thanked the minister s and officials who ha d contributed to its success. The meeting had made progress in fo rging strategic partnerships between the health and environmental sectors. It had su cceeded in identifying pr iorities and initial goals to consider. The follow-up process needed to be developed in order to maintain momentum. Canada looked forward to cont inued collaboration with PAHO in the formation and the work of the Task Force and in facilitating consultations internationally once the Task Force had fulfilled its mandate and the action phase had begun. Canada endorsed the proposal that the Governing Bodi es of PAHO should be informed annually about progress made toward compliance wi th the commitments made at the HEMA meeting. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 53 The Director thanked Canada for hosting the meeting, which had been useful and productive. It had been encouraging to see th at the ministers of health and environment had focused on such primary problems as wa ter and sanitation. PAHO looked forward to playing a part in the next phase. The Committee adopted Reso lution CE130.R20 on this item. Centennial of the Pan American He alth Organization (Document CE130/21) Mrs. Bryna Brennan, (Chief, Office of Public Information, PAHO) reported on the activities to mark the Centennial of PAHO. She described some of the events that had already taken place, and gave an overview of those still to come. She explained that after several years of planning and input from the entire Organization, the commemorative events were being held not just to celebrat e past achievements and future promise, but also to foster existing relationships, create new partnerships, and promote the work and mission of the Organization. The celebrati ons were reaching a wide variety of audiences\u2014the health sector, the scientific and academic communitie s, PAHO staff and the general public\u2014with the message of PAHO achievements and contributions to the health of the peoples of the Americas. The focus was on the work that the Organization had done with the countries of the Americas . Centennial material s and events were highlighting PAHO's work and mission and were designed to stir the spirit of PAHO staff to recommit to the Or ganization's goals and mission. Events were taking place at the organizat ional, national and regional levels, in an extremely wide variety of forms: fairs and exhibitions, symposia, postage stamps, contests and awards, media items, sporting events, creation of quilts, and so on. PAHO itself had created a special Centennial Web pa ge, and had produced videos, public service announcements, celebratory merchandise, and more. A number of delegates reported on what their countries were doing to mark the Centennial. The Delegate of Canada offered his c ongratulations on the success of the events so far and his best wishes for those sti ll to come. Canada ha d had a tree-planting ceremony to mark the Centennial. Alongside the tree was a commemorative granite plaque in the four languages of the Region. In gratitude for the Direct or's service to the Organization and in recognition of his interest in gardening, Canada wished to present him with the special shovel made for the occasion. The Director expressed his appreciation for the gift, re marking that it would be very useful in his retirement years. No ting that Organization was halfway through the CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 54 celebratory year, he thanked everyone who had contributed to the success of the Centennial, which was a celeb ration of all that the Member States had achieved. The Executive Committee took note of the presentation and the subsequent discussion, but did not consider it necessary to adopt a resolution on this item (Decision CE130(D6)). Administrative and Financial Matters Report on the Collection of Quota Co ntributions (Documents CE130/22 and CE130/22, Add. I) Mr. Mark Mathews (Chief , Department of Budget and Finance, PAHO) reported that, as of 31 December 2001, collection of quota assessments had totaled $92.9 million, of which $54.5 million represented paym ent of 2001 assessments and $38.4 million pertained to prior years. De tailed information on receipts of quota payments by Member States and payment dates was included in A nnex A of the document. On 1 January 2002, total arrears for years prior to 2002 stood at $49.2 million. Payments received between 1 January and 17 June 2002 had amounted to $18.6 million, or 38% of that total, reducing those arrears to $30.6 million, as compared to $22.2 million and $22 million in arrears at the corresponding times in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The collection of contributions for 2002 assessments amounted to $29.7 million as of 17 June 2002. Ten Member States had pa id their 2002 assessme nts in full, 5 had made partial payments, and 24 had not made any payments. The collections represented 33% of the current year's assessments; the corresponding figures were 32% in 2001, 27% in 2000, and 25% in 1999. Together, the colle ction of arrears and current year's assessments during 2002 totaled $48.3 million, as compared to $61.5 million in 2001, $47 million in 2000 and $45 million in 1999. Detaile d information on payments received and the application of those payments coul d be found in Annex B of the document. Article 6.B of the PAHO Constitution provided for the suspension of voting privileges if a country was in arrears by an amount in excess of two full years' quota payments. The 43 rd Directing Council, in Resolu tion CD43.R2, had requested the Director to continue to monitor the implem entation of special payment arrangements by Member States in arrears with prior years' quota assessments; to advise the Executive Committee of Member States' compliance with their quota payment commitments; and to report to the 26th Pan American Sanitary Conference on the status of the collection of quota contributions for 2002 and prior years. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 55 The Member States subject to Article 6.B at the present time were Argentina, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador. Argentina owed a to tal of $21.8 million, of which $9.7 million related to the years 1997 through 1999. It had submitted a deferred payment plan that had been accepted by the 42 nd Directing Council in 2000; by the opening of the 42nd Directing Council it had not made sufficient payments to be considered in compliance with the plan, but in resolution CD43.R2 the Directing Council had maintained Argentina's right to vote, noting, however, that no further extensions would be granted. Argentina was required to make payments totaling $7,725,967 prior to the opening of the 26 th Pan American Sanitary Conf erence. To date, it had made payments totaling $178,655. Cuba owed $2.0 million, of which approximately $197,000 related to 1999. It was in compliance with its deferred payment plan, which had been accepted by the Directing Council in 1996. The Dominican Republic owed approximately $550,000, of which about $103,000 was attributable to 1999. It had subm itted a deferred payment plan which had been approved in 2001, under which it needed to pay an additional amount of $188,060 prior to the end of 2002. Ecuador owed approximately $529,000, of which about $82,000 related to 1999. It was in compliance with the deferred payment plan approved by the Directing Council, and needed to ma ke payments totaling $220,000 during 2002. Peru was not currently subject to Ar ticle 6.B but under its 1999 deferred payment plan was required to pay $200,000 for 2001 and $652,980 for 2002, by the end of 2002. The Delegate of Canada noted that the issue of quota contribu tions continued to cause financial problems to the Organiza tion. The deferred payment process helped counties to catch up their arrears, wit hout placing them under undue stress. Every Member State had to do its part, and Canada urged Member States to pay their quota contributions on time and in full. The Delegate of Argentin a recalled that his country had been a very active participant in and contributor to the activ ities of PAHO since its foundation. Currently, his country was passing through a critical economic situation which was impacting all aspects of national life, including health. Argentina was determined to meet its commitment to PAHO and was remaining in close contact with the relevant departments in order to resolve the situation. The Director congratulated those countri es that were adhering to their deferred payment plans. The fact that countries kept up their payments, though doing so represented a major sacrifice in many cases , indicated the value they placed on the Organization. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 56 The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R3 on this item. PAHO Financial Regulations (Document CE130/23) This item was also introduced by Mr . Mathews, who expl ained that PAHO's current Financial Regulations, which had not been changed since 1991, were in need of revision since they were no longer consistent with WHO Regulations and did not fully reflect current accounting repor ting standards and modern business practices. During the past few month a comprehensive review of the existing regulations had been completed. Changes made by WHO had been analyzed, and the PAHO Regulations redrafted based on that review and analysis. Annex 1 of document CE130/23 compared and summarized each of the changes proposed and Annex 2 contained the proposed Financial Regulations. The proposed revisions to the regulations conformed, to the extent practical and possible, to those adopte d by WHO during May 2000 and re flected PAHO's compliance with the United Nations System Accounting St andards. In addition, the proposed changes included reorganization of materi al to reflect the financial cy cle, reclassification of some regulations as rules, correc tion of erroneous materials, and substantial editing which included elimination of extraneous and duplicat ed materials along with appropriate use of gender-neutral terms. While drawing attention to the explanati ons for all of the changes, set forth in Annex 1, he highlighted certain specific cha nges which were indicative of the types of revision being proposed. PAHO believed that the proposed re gulations represented a considerable improvement over the existing ones, in that th ey were presented in a clear and orderly manner and reflected currently accepted fina ncial practices and c ontrols. Although the proposed changes were rather extensive, the basic requirements of the existing regulations had not been substantially change d, and to the extent possible they had been made consistent with the WHO Financial Regulations. The Committee adopted Resolution CE 130.R4, endorsing the proposed revisions. Financial Report of the Director and Re port of the External Auditor for 2000-2001 (Official Document 305) and Report on the Working Capital Fund (Document CE130/24) Financial Report of the Director and Re port of the External Auditor for 2000-2001 Mr. Mathews summarized Official Document 305 , which contained the Director's report on the financial operat ions of PAHO for the peri od 1 January 2000-31 December CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 57 2001, the financial position of the Organiza tion as of 31 December 2001 and financial statements for the Caribbean Epidemiology Center (CAREC), the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute (CFNI), and the Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP). As was customary for a biennial report, the document was accompanied by an opinion from the External Auditor. The Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Reserves and Fund Balances as of 31 December 2001 and 31 December 1999 reflected the prudent management of the Organization's financial assets during the biennium. A substantial increase in the collecti on of current biennium assessments had resulted in an excess of income over expe nditures of $4.9 million in the Regular Budget for the biennium, prior to transfers. Receipt s of current biennium quota assessments had reached $132.1 million, an increase of $7.6 million over the preceding biennium. Receipts of quota payments for prior bie nnia amounted to $36.1 million, or 77% of the outstanding balance as of 1 January 2000. Four Member States were potentially subject to Article 6.B on 1 January 2002, as compared to seven Member States on 1 January 2000. Of the $4.9 million excess of income, $2.8 mi llion had been transferred to the Capital Equipment Fund, and $2.1 million to the Building Fund. The Working Capital Fund was fully capitalized at $15 million, of which the unencumbered portion amounted to $12.1 million. The three centers (CAREC, CF NI, and INCAP) had experienced a combined excess of income over expenditures of $2.4 million for the biennium. Miscellaneous income earned during the biennium plus savings on, or cancellation of, prior periods' obligations amounted to $18 million, which was an increase of $1 million over the previous biennium, and $3.9 million greater than the budgeted amount. Total 2000-2001 expenditures of $683 million reflected an increase of $50 million over the 1998-1999 biennium. That increase was at tributable to an increase of $9 million in the Organization's Regular Budget expendi tures; an increase of $28 million in the Revolving Fund for the Expanded Program on I mmunization, and an in crease of $9 in the Building Fund. The major expenditures for WHO were $77 million for the Regular Budget, $8 million for the Voluntary Fund for Health Promotion, $3 million for the Real Estate fund and $8 million for other projects. The Statement of Regular Budget Appr opriations for the Financial Period 2000-2001 showed that the Organization had had an approved and appropriated budget of $195 million, less staff assessments of $18 m illion, for an Effective Working Budget of $177 million. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 58 The Emergency Procurement Revolving Fund ended 2001 fully funded at $125,000. The Revolving Fund for the Expanded Program on Immunization had ended the year with a positive cash balance of $13 million, after expenditures totaling approximately $214 million during the bi ennium. For the Trust Fund projects, $106 million had been received during the biennium. Projects funded by donated trust funds and implemented during the biennium amounted to $104 million. CAREC's Regular Budget income had exceeded expenditures by $1 million, as a result of a $1.6 million increase in the collectio n of assessed contributions. At the end of the biennium, CAREC's prior accumulated deficit of $257,000 had changed to an accumulated Working Capital Fund balance of $737,000. Expenditures by CAREC against all funds had totaled over $9.1 milli on. The Statement of Quota Contributions from members showed balances due as of 31 December 2001 of $4.2 million, as compared to $5.2 million at the end of 1999. The Statement of Trust Funds for CAREC reflected an increase of $1.2 million in receipts and an increase of $675,000 in expenditures. Amounts due from donors to taled $279,000, advanced funds totaled $794,000, and there was thus a cash balance of $515,000 in the Trust Fund. CFNI had had an excess of income over expenditures of $48,000. The $310,000 increase in the collection of assessed quota contributions ha d resulted in an improvement of $297,000 in CFNI's biennial performance, as compared to the 1998-1999 biennial deficit of $249,000. CFNI's Regular Budget and Working Capital Fund's accumulated deficit had decreased to $344,000 as of 31 December 2001. The Statement of Quota Contributions showed that a rrears had decreased to $723,000, and the Statement of Trust Funds reflected expenditures of $204,000, which was an increase of $170,000 over the preceding biennium. INCAP had received income of $1.2 milli on for its Regular Budget, similar to the amount received in the preceding biennium. Due to careful oversight of expenditures, the Center had experienced a net excess of inco me over expenditure of $35,000. Because the Working Capital Fund was fully funded at $1 million, which excess had been transferred to the Provision for Fixed Assets Replacem ents Fund. The INCAP Endowment Fund had earned $9,000 in interest dur ing the biennium, contribut ing to the Fund's $348,000 balance. The statement of INCAP Trust Funds showed project income reaching $2.1 million with expenditures totaling $1.6 million in the biennium. The Trust Fund balances had increased from $250,000 on 1 January 2000 to $800,000 on 31 December 2001. The Report of the External Auditor wa s presented by Mr. Graham Miller on behalf of Sir John Bourn (External Audito r, National Audit Office of the United Kingdom). Mr. Miller said that the audit had revealed no w eaknesses or errors which the auditors had considered materially to impact the validity of the financial statements as a CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 59 whole. The external auditors were pleased to place an unqualified audit opinion on the statements for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001. The external audit was an informed and independent scrutiny, conducted according to rigorous standards and best practices. It might be said that in light of recent events the objectivity and integrity of the audit process was now of greater importan ce than ever before, particularly in organizations responsible for stewardshi p of public or Member State funds. As part of the work of auditing, the auditors had visited PAHO Headquarters and had also made audit visits to 10 field offi ces. Management letters reporting on those visits had been sent to PAHO management. For PAHO, the 2000-2001 audit report conf irmed a net excess of income over expenditure amounting to $4.9 million. The financ ial results for the biennium showed the Organization to be in a rela tively strong position, although there had been some reduction in collection of prior year s' assessed contributions. The financial position of CAREC had impr oved, in particular with the improved payments into its Trust Fund. However, arrear s of assessments were continuing to affect the Center's financial position. The external auditors encouraged Member States to adhere to the due times for the payment of their contributions. A number of observations had been made in management letters con cerning potential improvements in financial management and controls. At CFNI, the rate of collection of contributions was lower overall than at PAHO, despite the Institute's efforts to enco urage Member States to pay their assessments, and this was having a detrim ental effect on CFNI's financial viability. The audit report noted that the auditors had previous ly carried out a high-level review of PAHO's strategic planning, mon itoring and evaluation framework, which had been presented to the Executive Committ ee in June 2000. Following the auditors' recommendation of a system of cyclical reviews, at the request of the Director of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau an evaluation of the Pan American Center for Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences (CEPIS) had been undertaken in 2000-2001 with external audit partic ipation. The work had addres sed four main objectives concerning the effectiveness and management of the Center and also aimed to test a model which could be used for evaluating th e other centers genera lly. A report on the evaluation had been submitted to the Director. There was a separate aud it report on INCAP, which not ed the small net excess of income over expenditure. There had been a fu rther increase in th e proportion of quota contributions collected, and the systems of financial control remained sound and effective. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 60 The Delegate of Jamaica noted that CARICOM had some years previously requested an evaluation of the role of the various institutions such as CFNI, CAREC and so on, with a view to dete rmining whether their work could be carried out more effectively. It appeared that the non-perform ance of such an evaluation was coloring the attitudes of governments to the contribution process, and it wa s essential to ensure that the evaluation should be completed as early as possible. The Delegate of Canada expressed his pl easure at the favorable audit opinion and the overall conclusion that th e Organization was on a good fi nancial basis. Noting the pressure that was placed on an organization wh en dues were not paid in full and on time, he called on all Member States to make a serious attempt to do so. He asked whether excess income over expenditure could be used in the future to lower Member States' quota contributions. The Director said that few things were more important to the standing of an organization than the report on how its finan ces were conducted. If a public organization were to be detected in malfeasance or fra ud, it could be very seriously damaged. PAHO's resources came from the countries that were its members, which went to extreme lengths and underwent great hardship to pay thei r contributions. An unqualified audit opinion was not something that was i ssued lightly, and it represente d a clear seal of approval on the way the Organization's finances were ma naged. PAHO, he said, was fanatical in its sense of responsibility for the appropriate expenditure of public funds. Additionally, when PAHO received a management letter from the auditors, the Organization took it very seriously as something to be worked upon immediately. He hoped that the Executive Committee shared in his satisfaction at the positive report of the auditors on the way that the Organization's funds were being spent. It was a source of satisfaction that at least the deficit in the Working Capital Funds of CAREC and CFNI had been eliminat ed. At the recommendation of the auditors, certain funds which had been inactive for some years would be closed. He expressed concern at the non-payment by some Member States of their quotas. Knowing that non-payment was usually a matte r of inability rather than unwillingness, PAHO was sympathetic to their difficulty, but it also had difficulties of its own. Noting that fewer countries than in previous biennia were potentially subject to Article 6.B of the Constitution, he looked forward to the time when the figure would be zero. The possibility of using excess income to reduce quota contributions was perhaps something that could be studied, but he had found in his years as Director that the spirit in the Member States was not one of seeking to have lower contributi ons. Countries wished to be sure that their cont ributions were being appropria tely managed, and producing the desired outcomes, but did not seem con cerned to pare down their contributions. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 61 The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R5 on this item. Working Capital Fund Mr. Mark Mathews (Chief, Department of Budget and Finance, PAHO) drew the attention of the meeting to Document CE130/ 24, on the status of the Working Capital Fund. The Working Capital Fund had been esta blished pursuant to Resolution II of the third Meeting of the Directing Council, to be funded from surplus funds as of 31 December 1949. The primary purpose of the Working Capital Fund was to provide funds as required to finance the Regular B udget pending receipt of assessed contributions from Member States. Furthermore the Fund was also available to m eet the requirements of the Organization's Cent ers pending receipt of th eir assessed contributions. In 1979, the Inter-American Developmen t Bank had agreed to loan the Pan American Heath and Education Foundation (PAHEF) $5.0 million for the Textbook and Instructional Materials Program. PAHO had agr eed to guarantee the loan and maintain as a reserve a portion of the unencumbered ba lance of the Working Capital Fund. The reserve, which represented the outstanding balance of the loan, was $2.9 million as of 31 December 2001. In 1993, the 37 th Directing Council had authorized the Director to increase the Working Capital Fund from $11.0 million to $15.0 m illion, to reflect the increase in the biennial budget. Since that time, the Orga nization's activities had continued to expand and the budget had increased by 17%. Tota l PAHO expenditure, including procurement and other extrabudgetary activities, was exp ected to reach $600 million in the current biennium, representing an increase of over 80%. During the past three biennia, PAHO ha d drawn on the resour ces of the Working Capital Fund to fund Regular Budget deficits , extraordinary expenses arising from the renovation of the Headquarters building, unf oreseen requirements of the Revolving Fund for the Expanded Program on Immu nization, as well as temporar y deficits in two of the Centers administered by the Organization. During the 1994-1995 biennium, the Working Capital Fund had been fully depleted as the result of an unfavorable judgment by the ILO Tribunal. The biennial budget was funded bot h by assessed contributions and by miscellaneous income. Miscellaneous income , including investment income, had been projected to contribute $16.5 million to the 2002-2003 biennial budget. However, interest rates had fallen dramatically since those proj ections had been made and continued to be at a 40-year low in the United States. Ther efore, current estimates for miscellaneous income projected a shortfall of the budgeted amount by as much as $6.0 million. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 62 Although the Working Capital Fund was fully funded at $15 million, the unencumbered balance was $12.1 million, or less than two months' expenditure, after taking into account the reserve for the PAHEF lo an. Given the financial risks inherent in the current economic and political environm ent, an increase of $8.0 million in the maximum capitalization of the Working Ca pital Fund was requested. At $23.0 million, the Working Capital Fund would equal about three months' current expenditure. The increase could be funded from the collection of arrears of contributions during the current and future biennia. The Delegate of Canada asked whethe r prompt payment of quota contributions would lessen the requirement for an increase in the Working Capital Fund. The Delegate of the United States requested more inform ation on the balance of the Working Capital Fund over the years since 1994-1995. She pointed out that PAHO had other specialized funds to deal with unf oreseen or extraordinar y expenditures, such as the Building Fund. It was the position of the United States that international organizations' working capital funds should be no more than 8.3% of thei r annual budgets, equivalent to one month's operating expenditures. The 8.3% target had been endorsed by the United Nations Joint Inspection Unit for United Nations system agencies. As PAHO's Working Capital Fund was already close to twice that level, the United States could not support the proposal to increase it. She suggested that the issue might be reexamined in one year's time, as it seemed that no really large expenditures were anticipated within the coming year. Mr. Mathews responded that prompt paym ent of quota contributions would lessen the requirement for an increase in Working Capital Fund, but would not eliminate it. As of June 2002, arrears to the Organization tota led $91 million. He recalled that the balance of the Working Capital Fund had been $156,000 at the end of the 1994-1995 biennium, $6.8 million at the end of 1996-1997, and $15 million at the end both of 1998-1999 and of 2000-2001. The target of one month's operati ng expenditures as a level for a working capital fund had been proposed by one inspector in a Joint Inspecti on Unit report dated 1989. That report had also stated that evaluation of the de sirable levels of a working capital fund should take account of several f actors, including the objective of the fund, other types of reserves such as special funds for currency fluctuations, and authority to borrow. PAHO had no such other reserves, nor did it have the capacity for internal borrowing. A Working Capital Fund of $23 million would represent 12% of the PAHO Regular Budget but only 8% of the combin ed PAHO/WHO budget. Other United Nations organizations had working capital levels of 9% to 13% of their budgets. Dr. Alleyne recalled that in the 1994-1995 biennium, when he had become Director, the unfavorable judgment by the IL O Tribunal, coupled w ith other unforeseen expenditures, had forced PAHO to cut sta ff and programs. The Organization had just squeaked by, almost emptying the Working Ca pital Fund. He had vowed to the Executive Committee that such a situation would never occur again. Thanks to careful management CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 63 over the years, the Working Capital Fund ha d been restored, but a larger buffer was needed. While it was true that some other or ganizations had sma ller working capital funds, those organizations diffe red from PAHO in that they ha d the capacity for internal borrowing, which he did not consider a good ma nagement practice. A fund equivalent to three months' operating expenses was not a huge amount; it was a reasonable cushion against uncertainty. Having an adequate Working Capital Fund was a matter of prudence, since no one could predict the fu ture in terms of financial stability. In the past year, for example, interest rates had plummeted, havi ng a devastating effect on the Organization's projected income. By the tim e the Executive Committee met in June 2003, the reasons for having a larger buffer would no dou bt be even more cogent. In the interim, the Secretariat would provide Member States with more information on what had happened when the Organization had been close to the financial brink. The Executive Committee decided to reexamine the issue of the Working Capital Fund at its 132 nd Session in 2003 (Decision CE130(D5)). PAHO Buildings and Facilities (Document CE130/25, Rev. 1) Dr. Richard Marks (Chief, Department of General Serv ices, PAHO) reported that the PAHO Headquarters building renovation proj ect had been completed essentially on schedule and slightly under the allotted budget of $13 million. The building had been thoroughly modernized, virtually all asbestos-containi ng materials had been removed, and a number of modifications had been made to bring the building into compliance with United States laws on access for persons with disabilities. New ergonomically designed work stations and amenities, such as coffee-break areas and conference rooms, had improved working conditions for staff. With the project's completi on, the Building Fund ceiling would return to its normal level of $500,000. The Secretariat was now requesting the Committee's approval for a new project to be financed from the Building Fund. That proj ect would repair and re place sections of the concrete floors in the basement and sub-ba sement, which had been damaged by water and were showing signs of severe wear and t ear. The amount requested for the project was $220,000. The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R 11, approving the pr oposed project. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 64 Personnel Matters Amendments to the PASB St aff Rules (Document CE130/26) Mr. Philip MacMillan (Chief, Department of Personnel, PAHO) summarized the amendments that had been made to the Sta ff Rules and Regulations of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau since the Committee's 128 th Session in 2001. Those amendments were consistent with the revisions already a dopted by the WHO Executive Board at its 108th and 109th sessions. Resolution CE59.R19, adopted by the Executive Committee at its 59th Session in 1968, reque sted the Director to introduce any necessary changes to maintain close similarity between the St aff Rules of PASB and those of WHO. Staff Rule 330.2 amended the salary scale for staff in the professional and higher- graded categories, on a no-gain, no-loss ba sis, in accordance with the adjustments approved by the United Nations General Assembly. As a result of that change, the salaries of the Assistant Director, Deputy Dire ctor, and Director also had to be modified. The Executive Committee was asked to approve the resulting salary changes for the posts of Assistant Director and Deput y Director and to recommend that the 26th Pan American Sanitary Conference approve the applicab le revision to the Director's salary. Staff Rule 110.7 clarified the requirements regarding staff disclosure of interests that might conflict with t hose of the Organization. St aff Rules 350.1 and 350.2.2 related to boarding costs for eligible children of in ternationally recruited staff who were entitled to an education grant. Staff Rule 530 dea lt with staff supervision and performance evaluation and had been amended to reflect the introduction of PAHO's new performance appraisal system. The remaining amendments to the Staff Rules and Regulations were related to changes in contractual arrangements approve d by the WHO Executive Board in January 2002. Those changes could be divided into three general categories. One category pertained to the discontinuation of career se rvice appointments and the establishment of three types of contracts: temporary appointments (11 m onths or less), fixed-term appointments (1-5 years), and service appointments (no fixed time limit, but the appointment would continue onl y as long as the functions we re required and the staff member's performance was satisfactory). A second category included changes in the duration of temporary appointments and bene fits for staff hired under a term-limited appointment. The third category had to do w ith separation procedures for staff whose posts were abolished. Document CE130/26 contained the text of the amendments to the Staff Rules and Regulations, together with a more detailed explanation of each change. The Executive Committee was asked to confirm those amendments. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 65 The Delegate of the United States of America noted that, while some of the changes were constructive because they placed higher priority on merit and performance, some would have cost implications. Her dele gation was aware that it was PAHO's policy to amend its Staff Rules to bring them in to conformity with changes approved by the WHO Executive Board; however, at the Dir ector's discretion, PAHO might opt not to implement some of the changes. In any case, the United States hoped that the Secretariat would apply the amendments very carefully to ensure that they did not add a significant new financial burden. Mr. MacMillan assured the Committee that the Secretariat would see that the Staff Rules were interpreted and applied pr operly, taking care to avoid any major cost increases. Overall, he believed that the cha nges were positive, preci sely because they did place more emphasis on performance and on assu ring that staff perf ormed at the high level expected by the Organization's Member States. The Committee adopted Resolution CE130.R 12, confirming the amendments to the Staff Rules and Regulations , establishing the salaries of the Assistant Director and Deputy Director, and recommending that the 26 th Pan American Sanitary Conference confirm the change in the Director's salary. Statement by the Representative of the PA SB Staff Association (Document CE130/27) Mrs. Brenda Simons Gilliam (President , PASB Staff Associ ation) thanked the Committee for allowing the Staff Associatio n the opportunity to present some of its concerns in relation to the changes in the St aff Rules and other matters affecting working conditions for the Organization' s personnel. Some of the St aff Rules changes were good. The extension of health care coverage to te mporary staff, in particular was welcome. Indeed, there could be no justification for a health organization not to provide health insurance for all its employees. However, the Staff Association object ed strenuously to other changes. For example, the change in the procedure for abolishment of posts and reduction in force (RIF) would greatly diminish staff job securi ty. To protect the acqui red rights of current staff, the Association felt that the procedure should not be changed or, if the amendments approved by WHO were adopted, the new procedure should appl y only to staff hired after the effective date of the change. In additi on, the Association was concerned that tasks performed by staff whose posts were abolishe d might be reassigned to current staff who were already overburdened. It wished to empha size that posts should be abolished only if the functions associated with that post were no longer necessary. The Staff Association was also troubled by the impact that th e changes in Staff Rule 530 might have on PAHO's performa nce appraisal system, which had been CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 66 designed with staff input and was tailored sp ecifically to the requirements of PAHO. The Association urged the Secretar iat to adopt only those aspe cts of the WHO performance evaluation system that responded to th e needs of PAHO and its staff. The Staff Association continued to ma intain that any human resource reforms introduced within WHO and PAHO should be the product of a collective bargaining process that provided for good faith ne gotiation by staff and management. The Association therefore proposed that a joint staff-management committee be designated within PAHO to study the issue and formulat e a proposal to be submitted at the next meeting of the WHO Global Staff-Management Council. Additionally, the Staff Association was concerned about the problem of harassment, which existed at PAHO to varying degrees. A policy like the one implemented at WHO was needed, as wa s training for both supervisory and non- supervisory staff on what cons tituted harassment and how to deal with it. Security for field staff was another matter requiring attent ion. The Staff Association felt that, when field offices were moved, sta ff safety should be a paramount consideration, since human resources were the Organization's most im portant resource. The Association also requested the development of a s ecurity plan to protect nation ally recruited staff and their families in the event of natural disaster s, political upheaval, or other dangerous conditions. Other issues of concern included career development opportunities for staff and the erosion of pensions for general services staff due to currency devaluation. The Staff Association enjoyed an amicable and courte ous relationship with the Administration and looked forward to continued dialogue to ad dress those and other issues raised in Document CE130/27. In the discussion that ensued, various delegates pointed out that, ideally, the Committee would have heard the statement by the Staff Association representative before it was asked to consider the amendments to the Staff Rules. As the resolution confirming those amendments had already been adopted, there was little the Committee could do with respect to the issues broached in the presentation. The Committee also pointed out that some of the problems cited by Ms. Si mons Gilliam\u2014notably that of harassment\u2014 had not been discussed in the document a nd suggested that future documents should include all the matters which the Staff Asso ciation wished the Committee to consider. The Delegate of Jamaica noted that her country had been mentioned as one of the countries in which the PAHO field office ha d been relocated. The office now occupied the same building as the Ministry of Hea lth. Since the building had 24-hour security services and access was tightly controlled, she felt certain that the PAHO staff were being adequately protected. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 67 In response, Ms. Simons Gilliam said that it was customary to have the Staff Association representative address the Comm ittee after the Chief of Personnel. She had been unaware, however, that the Committee w ould have already adopted a resolution on the Staff Rules prior to her presentation. As for the issue of harassm ent, it had not been included in Document CE130/27 because the St aff Association had requested that she mention it in her statement after th e document had gone to press. The Director said that it simply had not occurred to him to reverse the traditional order of the items on the Committee's agenda and have the Staff Association representative precede the Chief of Personnel. However, even if she had spoken first, it would have been impossible to accede to some the Association's requests. The changes to the Staff Rules had already been approved by the WHO Executive Board, and PAHO had no choice but to implement them, since some PAHO posts were funded by WHO. It was just not managerially feasib le to apply different rules to staff in PAHO-funded posts. With respect to the Staff Association's concer ns about abolishment of posts, he pledged that posts would be eliminated only if th e functions were no longer necessary. Post abolishment would never be used as a me ans of dealing with unsatisfactory staff performance, which was a separate issue entirely. As concerned the evaluation of staff pe rformance, PAHO would not automatically adopt all aspects of the WHO system. In many respects, PAHO's performance appraisal system was more advanced, and, in fact, WH O had copied many of the good points of the PAHO system. That system was based on agre ement between supervisors and those they supervised on the tasks to be carried out. The evaluation was not judgmental, nor was it intended to be a mechanism for castigating staff. Rather, it was designed to reveal whether a person had performed as agreed. With regard to staff security, he assured the Committee that PAHO was very attentive to the safety of its field staff, a nd almost every move to new premises had been made precisely to enhance secu rity and working conditions for staff. As for the security of national staff, PAHO was obliged to follow the United Nations field security handbook. Nevertheless, because the Organization was deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of all its staff, in some cases it had put in place procedures that went beyond the United Nations regulations, such as transportation for nationally recruited staff. He truly did not believe that national staff were at any disadvantage with respect to other staff in terms of security protection. As for the issue of harassment, he woul d not want the Committee to be left with the impression that harassment was a major problem at PAHO. Still, a policy on the subject was under discussion with the Sta ff Association, and a policy on sexual harassment had already been adopted seve ral years earlier. In regard to career development, while PAHO did not have a \"car eer ladder,\" per se, it had provided career CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 68 development opportunities that had enabled a nu mber of staff members to advance within the Organization. He was a strong proponent of PAHO's staff development program, even though some staff who benefited fr om the program might later leave the Organization because the possi bilities for career advancemen t were necessarily limited. Because of the conditions of service in the United Nations system, PAHO could not consider adopting the kind of collective bargaining system normal utilized in the private sector. However, he would be happy to set up a committee to look at the ILO's experience with collective bargaining and a ssess whether it would be advantageous for PAHO to develop a similar system. He had long said that he would always defend the staff's right to free association and their ri ght to express their views, as long as the relationship between himself and the Staff Association was characterized by mutual respect and understanding. He wa s pleased that that had been the case for all eight years of his directorship. The Executive Committee thanked the sta ff of the Organization for their hard work and dedication and expressed the convic tion that the good will that existed on both sides would enable the Staff Association and th e Administration to arrive at a satisfactory resolution of the issues raised in the presen tation. The Committee took note of the report, but did not consider it necessa ry to adopt a resolution on this item (Decision CE130(D7)). General Information Matters Resolutions and other Actions of the Fifty-fi fth World Health Assemb ly of Interest to the PAHO Executive Committee (Document CE130/28) The Deputy Director summarized key as pects of 19 resoluti ons adopted by the Fifty-fifth World Health Assembly (May 2002) that the Secretariat co nsidered to be of particular relevance to th e Region of the Americas. The first resolution adopted by the Assembly congratulated PAHO on its centennial. Dr. Brandling-Bennett drew the Co mmittee's attention to the resolutions that dealt with mental health (responding to th e call for action); hea lth and sustainable development; the contribution of WHO to th e follow-up of the United Nations General Assembly special session on HIV/AIDS; pr otection of medical missions during armed conflict; ensuring access to essential medici nes; smallpox eradication (destruction of Variola virus stocks); global publi c health response to natura l occurrence, accidental release, or deliberate use of biological and ch emical agents or radi onuclear rrhagic fever control; quality of care (patient safety); WHO' s contribution to the achievement of the development goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration; diet, physical activit y, and health; infant CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 69 and young child nutrition; financial repor t on the accounts of WHO for 2000-2001; members in arrears to an extent whic h would justify invoking Article 7 of the Constitution; arrears in payment of contributions (Dominican Republic); salaries of staff in ungraded posts and of the Director-Genera l; amendments to the Staff Regulations; and the need for increased represen tation of developing countries in the Secret ariat and in Expert Panels and Advisory Committees. In addition, he reported that Chile's Nati onal Program of Integrated Dental Care for Poor Working Women had been awarded the Sasakawa Health Prize. He extended PAHO's congratulations to that program. Th e United States of America had been elected to designate a member to the Executive Board, which had held its 110th Session immediately after the Assembly. Dr. Clarice Modeste-Curwen, Minister of Health of Grenada, had been elected Vice-President of the Executive Board. The Committee took note of the report but did not consider it necessary to adopt a resolution on this item (Decision CD130(D8)). Other Matters The Delegate of El Salvador called atte ntion to the growing seriousness of the dengue situation in his country. Some 7,400 cas es had been diagnosed and 7 children had died from the disease. He requested c ontinued support from PAHO and urged the countries of the Central American subregion to join forces in combating the disease, in keeping with Resolution CD43.R4, adopted th e previous year by the Directing Council, which called for a coordinated response. The Director said that PAHO would do everything possible to encourage a regional approach to dengue, which was unqu estionably a problem that transcended national borders. The Organization advocated an intersectoral approach that emphasized health promotion, health education and communication, and community participation aimed at controlling the vector, Aedes aegypti , in order to prevent epidemics from occurring, rather than reacting to them after they occurred. To that end, the Secretariat had recently added a staff memb er with expertise in comm unications and, following the Directing Council in 2001, he had written to th e ministers of health of all the Member States, encouraging them to ma ke common cause with minister s of education in the fight against dengue. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 70 Award Presentation by the World Veterinary Epidemiology Society The President introduced Dr. James H. Steele, who presented an award to Dr. George Alleyne on behalf of the World Veterinary Epid emiology Society. Dr. Steele was a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine who also held a Master of Public Health degree. He had enjoyed a long and distinguished career in veterinary public health. Among his many accomplishments, he had established the Veterinary Public Health Division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States and been instrumental in launching veterinary public health activities within WHO and FAO. Dr. Steele continued to serve as a consultant to numerous nationa l and international agencies, including PAHO and WHO. At present, he was professor emer itus at the University of Texas School of Public Health and served as a consultant to the Institute of Food Science and Engineering at Texas A & M University, where his work focused on food industry hygiene and control of foodborne diseases. Dr. Steele recalled that his first intro duction to PAHO had come in 1945, when he had been asked to evaluate some veterinary public health problems in the Caribbean. At that time, he had recommended that the Organi zation establish a veterinary public health program, and it was indeed gratifying to see th at, almost 50 years later, that program was thriving. Carrying on the tradition begun by Dr. Fred Soper, Sir George Alleyne had helped make PAHO's program a model for th e world in international collaboration between agriculture and public health and be tween veterinary and human medicine. The World Veterinary Epidemiology Societ y had honored him by creating the James H. Steele Award, and he was immensely please d to present the award to Dr. Alleyne for his distinguished service and c ontribution to the progress of veterinary public health. The Director was deeply honored to receiv e the award personally from Dr. Steele, who was an icon of public health and a true legend in his time and for all time. He accepted the award not only in his own name but on behalf of all those dedicated professionals at PAHO and elsewhere in the Region who had labored l ong and hard in the field of veterinary public health. Dr. Steele represented the very soul of intersectoral work. If those who followed in his footsteps accomplished a fraction of what he had done to ensure the indivisibility of veterinary and human medicine , they could feel very proud indeed. On behalf of the entire Pan Ameri can Health Organization, he wished to thank Dr. Steele for the invaluable contribution he had made to the peoples of the Americas through his devotion to vete rinary public health. Closing of the Session The Director expressed hi s appreciation to the Member s and Observers for their active participation and keen at tention to the work of the Committee. He also thanked the President for the skillful manner in which he had conducted the session. CE130/FR (Eng.) Page 71 Dr. Ramsammy's efficiency had enabled th e Committee to accomplish a great deal in only a few days. The Committee could feel pro ud of the resolutions it had crafted. Its attention to detail and the consensus achieved in regard to the conten t of those resolutions would greatly facilitate the work of the Pan American Sanitary Conference in September. The President said that Guyana had been honored an d privileged to serve as President of the Executive Committee. He felt the session had been very productive, and he thanked the participants for their constructive contributions to the Committee's deliberations.
