N.L. Bell Editor's CommentsThis is the first issue for 2001, our third volume. NAJP was issuedtwice a year for the first two years, but this year we are doing three thisone, which you are probably getting in late March or early April, asummer issue, followed by one in the late Fall.Thanks again to all the reviewers, all of whom did a marvelous job ofcritiquing papers promptly and with great insight. Without our reviewers,this journal would simply not have the quality it has today.As some of you already know, we are now abstracted inPsychological Abstracts. You probably do not need to be reminded howmuch that means in terms of widespread circulation of the articles wepublish. I received a call recently from a person representing a universitylibrary. He wanted an article that had appeared in our last issue - foundout about it through the online version of Psych. Abstracts. This meansthat all of our previous issues are or will be abstracted soon.With this issue, James Jones, one of the most respected individuals inthe area of social psychology, joins our advisory editorial board. We are privileged to have him with us. Congratulations to Phil Zimbardo,another board member, for the national honor which he won.Special thanks to Mike Shaughnessy, who has a knack for conductinggreat interviews on behalf of NAJP. This issue features an interview withRobert Sternberg, in which he discusses his research and his views onlearning disabilities.Lynn E. McCutcheon, editor iii Sense of Humor in Black and WhiteJames A. ThorsonF. C. PowellUniversity of Nebraska at OmahaV. T. SamuelGrambling State UniversityThere are many articles in the literature comparing examples of black andwhite humor, but there is surprisingly little information providing datagiving comparisons of black and white samples in terms of sense of humor.This article compares scale and item scores of 116 Black and 357 Whiteuniversity students on the Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale. Overallscores were not significantly different, and there were only a few significantdifferences in individual item scores.\"Humor is a way to keep from killing yourself...it removes anxiety. Otherkids threw rocks. I make jokes.\" -- Abe Burrows, as cited in Dorinson &Boskin, 1988. .Ways to describe cultures are found in ethnic humor. Especially withregard to coping humor, some cultures exhibit characteristically self-deprecating humor. This may in fact be a display of strength, toparadoxically poke fun at one's own weakness. Freud (1916) would haveargued that this is the highest form of coping. Valliant (1977) calls humorthe most elegant of the defenses. Lefcourt and Martin (1986) havedemonstrated that humor is used as a potent coping mechanism.Sense of humor itself has been shown in a number of studies to berelated to several beneficial constructs, including creativity (Humke &Schaefer, 1996); coping with stress (Kuiper, McKenzie, & Belanger, 1995);a higher discomfort threshold (Hudak, Dale, & Hudak, & Ruch, 1996); and & Goldstein, 1989; Squire, 1995; vanWormer& Boes, 1997). It may contribute to longevity (Yoder & Haude, 1995) andit is related to both age and gender (Thorson, Powell, Sarmany- Schuller, &Hampes, 1997). It also correlates significantly with the personality traits ofexhibition and dominance (Thorson & Powell. 1993b).Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: James A.

An exception is a study by Smeltzer and Leap(1988), who asked 118 White and 47 Black employees to rate theappropriateness of neutral, sexist, and racist jokes in the workplace.Surprisingly, Whites rated racist jokes as more inappropriate than didBlacks, although differences were slight. This research, however, did nottest for overall sense of humor, just for opinions on the appropriateness ofparticular types of jokes. More usual is the type of article written by Aznam(1989), which points out that humor is a social lubricant that allows peopleof different races to get along better by laughing at themselves, but withoutany data presentation or analysis.One would be hard-pressed to say that there is a characteristically\"black\" coping humor; one might argue that the African Americanpopulation is so culturally diverse as to be difficult to compare it to smaller,more socially cohesive groups in this regard. That is, while many Blacks nodoubt use coping humor on a daily basis, it would be as improper to drawthis as a racial or cultural stereotype for African Americans as it would beto do so for Americans of European heritage. Rather, one might argue that\"black jokes\" are currently more likely to be told by racist Whites than theyare by Blacks. On the other hand, \"Jewish jokes,\" by comparison, are aslikely to be told by Jews as by anyone else, and it is a mark of culturalacceptance and assimilation that they often are seen in a less sensitive lightthan are jokes that are at the expense of African Americans.An illustration might be the story of the priest and the rabbi who areneighbors. When he gets a new car, the priest blesses it with holy water.Seeing this, the rabbi is at a loss as to what to do when he gets his new car.Thinking that he must do something, he goes out and cuts an inch off the tailpipe. This is the kind of joke that can be (and is) told by Jew and non-Jewalike, with no hard feelings.Ziv (1984) gives the example of three Jews who have been placed infront of the firing squad. The officer asks the first if he wants a blindfold.\"Yes,\" says the first one; the officer asks the second one if he wants ablindfold, and he says yes. Asked if he wants a blindfold, the third one turnsit down, at which point the second Jew leans over and whispers: \"Moishe,stop making trouble\" (p. 60). This is a classic example of humor in whichthe participants are coping.More sensitive would be the joke about the African American whomoves into a white neighborhood. Seen cutting the grass, a white neighborasks him what he charges tomow a lawn. The reply: \"I get to sleep with thelady of the house.\" While it is healthy to laugh at our prejudices, some Thorson, Powell, & Samuel Humor in Black and White 3 Blacks and Whites alike might take exception to such a jest; racialsensitivity is such in both cultures as to make joking less acceptable.At any rate, we would argue that social norms have changed in recentdecades to such a degree that racial humor has lost the easy acceptance itmight have found in, say, the 1970s, just as in contemporary society oneseldom hears the kind of racist humor that might have been acceptable in the1950s. So, we might advance the idea that while some cultures can bedescribed by their humor, one would be hard-pressed to say that this is trueamong African Americans, and that cultural norms about humor vary alongwith other social changes.The beauty of humor, however, is in its complexity. Jokes have differentmeanings to different ears. Take, for example, the story told in the 1960s ofthe white boater who was seen in Louisiana pulling a black water skier. Anobserver allowed that it was wonderful to see such unexpected harmonybetween the races. A good old boy sitting on the dock corrected him: \"Naw,Jake's just trolling for gators.\" Who is the butt of the joke here? It is jokingat the expense of the racist White, but it might equally be interpreted asracist humor at the expense of the hapless Black on the water skis. Again,we would argue that this is the kind of anecdote that has lost its socialacceptability. It may have been a refreshing way to laugh at racism when thejoke was current circa 1968; few - White or Black - would now be caughttelling such a story in polite society. Cultural norms change like the seasons,and propriety changes as well. Still, we cannot conclude that there is atypically self-deprecating vein that is characteristic in African Americanhumor similar to, say, Jewish humor.Apte (1987) observed that ethnic humor has become controversial,particularly when groups are made the butt of humor initiated by anyone butthemselves. As a result there is a growing ambivalence toward its use,particularly in the public domain. He went on to observe that a sense ofhumor is a core cultural value in American society. He argued that societalconsensus in America is that a person with a sense of humor is moresociable, easier to get along with and to work with, innovative, and capableof overcoming adversities. Thus sense of humor is usually regarded as avirtuous personality trait (1987). Apte then noted, however, the increasingemphasis on cultural and ethnic pluralism, and wondered if assimilation intoone dominant culture now has the importance that it once did. \"During themelting pot era of emphasis on assimilation, the numbers of ethnic minoritygroups had to grin and bear the humor of which they were the butt. In asense they conformed, at least outwardly, to the dominant value of havinga sense of humor since they learned to tolerate and, on occasion, to forcelaughter at the disparaging humor initiated by the outsiders at their expense\"(1987, p. 33). Racial jokes have subsequently lost their social sanction. 4NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Early in the 1970s it was observed that no one laughed at racist humor anymore. Thus, according to Apte, cultural norms have evolved, and thequestion has arisen: do groups differ in basic sense of humor, which seemsunlikely, or only in what is culturally acceptable as topical humor? \"It isinteresting that the practice of telling self-disparaging jokes has beencommon among some ethnic groups such as Jews and Blacks. It appears thatsuch jokes, when told by members of the ethnic groups themselves, areacceptable. Only when outsiders tell them does the joke become public andnot tolerated\" (1987, p. 38).Apte concludes that uses of ethnic humor in contemporary society havecome under severe constraints, and that members of various ethnic groupsno longer are forced to display their sense of humor by laughing at jokes ofwhich they are the target. This says nothing, however, about which groupsare higher or lower in basic sense of humor, or in what ways various groupsmight construe humor differently. Apte presents no data or experimentalinvestigation to bolster his arguments.Similarly, Jaret (1999) has written about attitudes toward ethnic humor.He did a data-based study, surveying 727 Blacks and Whites on theirfeelings toward the uses of ethnic humor. There were a few inter-racialdifferences, but the overall conclusion was that Black and White attitudesare not polarized. Jaret, however, did not probe for any racial differences insense of humor or constructions of humor.Brabant and Mooney (1999) took the innovative approach of comparingthe comic strip Curtis, the protagonist and author of which are AfricanAmerican, with similar comics about little boys who happen to be white,Dennis the Menace and Calvin and Hobbes. While maintaining that Sundaycomics reflect cultural values, Brabant and Mooney in fact demonstratedfew differences in cultural values. Neither did they attempt any analysis ofhumor or sense of humor reflected in the respective comic strips.Davies (1990) argues that ethnic put-down humor is universalthroughout the world, and that it would be impossible to find a type ofhumor that is totally unique to any nationality. Bowles (1994), on the otherhand, maintains that there is a distinctly \"black\" humor that is used as adefense mechanism in response to perceptions of a racist majority culture.This coping humor releases repressed feelings and promotes groupcohesiveness. That is, we make fun of that which threatens us.Brake pointed out in 1975 that what was then referred to as \"Negrohumor\" had started to change from self-effacing, survival humor to a moreaggressive anti-racism style of humor. Perhaps, like Jewish humor, there hasbeen less of a need with black humor to \"shuffle\" in recent years; as socialnorms between the races have changed in the past several decades, we mighthypothesize that types of humor used by both Black and White persons have Thorson, Powell, & Samuel Humor in Black and White 5 become more homogeneous. By extension, we might advance for thehypothesis of the present study that there are few actual sense of humordifferences between whites and blacks.METHODParticipantsSamples of 357 White and 116 Black university students completed theMultidimensional Sense of Humor Scale (MSHS). Respondents in the Blacksample were students at Grambling State University; they ranged in agefrom 18 to 51 years (M = 21.9 years, SD = 4.7). The Whites were studentsat the University of Nebraska at Omaha. They ranged in age from 17 to 62(M = 24.3 years, SD = 8.0). In both instances the university students werevolunteers. Asking them to complete the MSHS had previously beenapproved by the respective Institutional Review Boards.Instrument and ProcedureThe MSHS (Thorson & Powell, 1993a) contains 24 self-descriptiveLikert items testing for humor creativity (\"Sometimes I think up jokes andfunny stories\"), coping (\"Uses of humor help to put me at ease\"), attitudestoward humorous people (\"I appreciate those who generate humor\"),attitudes toward humor itself (\"I like a good joke\"), and facility at socialuses of humor (\"I can ease a tense situation by saying something funny\").Respondents are asked to indicate choices on each item on a five-pointscale ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" Scoring is from0 to 4 on each item, with blanks scored as 2. There are 18 positively-phraseditems; the scale's six negatively-phrased items are reversed in scoring. Inevery instance a higher numerical score indicates higher sense of humor.Scores on the MSHS have been shown (Thorson & Powell, 1993a) to varyby gender, males generally scoring higher in humor creativity and femaleshaving higher coping humor scores, so comparisons are reported separatelyfor females and males. All participants were given the MSHS at theirrespective universities, for which they received extra credit in anundergraduate course.RESULTSCronbach alphas for the two groups were .89 for the Black respondentsand .91 for White respondents. The .01 level of significance was usedbecause of the large number of comparisons. The total MSHS score forBlack women was slightly higher than that for White women, but thedifference was not statistically significant. Black women, however, scoredsignificantly higher on two of the 24 scale items: 6NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Sometimes I think up jokes and funny stories.I'm confident that I can make other people laugh.The White female respondents scored significantly higher on just twoitems:I appreciate those who generate humor.Uses of humor help to put me at ease.The Black and White male respondents also did not differ significantlyin total MSHS scores; there were significant differences between the twogroups on only one of the items. Black respondents were higher on:Uses of humor help to put me at ease.There were no statistically significant differences in total MSHS scorebetween Black women (M = 68.2, SD = 12.5) and Black men (M = 65.3, SD= 10.6) t = 1.02. Similarly, the total scale scores for White males (M = 67.7,SD = 14.3) and White females (M = 67.2, SD = 12.5), did not differsignificantly (t = 0.35).DISCUSSIONThe sense of humor scores for both groups were surprisingly similar,particularly in view of the fact that the Black sample's data was gathered inLouisiana and the White sample's in Nebraska. One might have anticipatedat least a few cultural differences based on geography, if not upon race. Themale groups in particular were so similar as to merit little further analysis.The total MSHS scores for the White and the Black males were notsignificantly different, and there was only one of the 24 item scores thatdisplayed statistical difference. Perhaps greater differences might haveemerged with larger samples, particularly of African American males.Nevertheless, the item scores indicate no clear pattern of difference.Sometimes total scale scores that are similar emerge that way because of onegroup being higher in a particular element of humor and the other groupbeing higher in another, the differences balancing each other out. This is notthe case with the male respondents in the present study. African Americanswere higher on one coping humor item. There is no clear pattern ofdifference, and we can conclude that, at least within this sample, there is nopronounced sense of humor difference between White and Black males.Geography made no difference, perhaps because all of these respondentshave been exposed to national electronic entertainment media virtually all of their lives. Theremay be subtle uses of humor that are race or place Thorson, Powell, & Samuel Humor in Black and White 7 specific, but in terms of the elements of sense of humor as measured by theMultidimensional Sense of Humor Scale, there are no real differences for allpractical purposes. Conclusions more pronounced than that should, ofcourse, be based on multiple studies with large, diverse samples.A more interesting pattern of difference emerges among the women.The White female respondents indicated higher scores on just one of thecoping humor items; the Black women had higher scores on none of thecoping humor items. They were not significantly different on the remainingitems that tested for coping humor, so perhaps we could call it almost evenbetween the two groups in terms of uses of humor for adaptation or coping.The White women were higher on one other scale item, the appreciationof humorous people. This is not a clear pattern, but there is some slightevidence here to suggest that white women in this sample place a somewhathigher value on humor appreciation.The interesting pattern that emerges, however, is with the AfricanAmerican women's higher scores on humor generativity. These respondentssay that they think up jokes and funny stories, and are confident that theycan make others laugh. Both of these differences were statisticallysignificant.One of the things that we can say with some certainty about people whogenerate humor is that they try harder. That is, it takes some effort andmotivation to create humor out of everyday situations, and it takes a certainuninhibited boldness to venture to share it with others. Other research hasfound a relationship between humor creativity and the personality trait ofexhibition (Thorson & Powell, 1993b). The same study found a relationshipbetween humor creativity and dominance, thus the group control item. Thehumor creator takes the initiative in the group interaction; she may entertain,certainly, but she also seeks to be in charge and set the agenda.It might be said that all human interaction is cultural to a certain degree,and uses of humor certainly could be said to be culturally influenced. In thisstudy we have presented some data to indicate that African Americanwomen describe themselves as higher in the creativity element of sense ofhumor, at least in comparison to the sample of white women tested.This may be something of a hypothesis-building finding. It should bereplicated, certainly, but additional research might be in order to determineif younger Black women are less inhibited in uses of humor, if there arecultural patterns that demand greater humor creation efforts on their part, orif there is a kind of humor of oppression in play here that necessitates humorgeneration as a group survival technique. 8NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY REFERENCESApte, M.

BrinkerSouthwest Missouri State UniversityAdult female clients lost highly significant amounts of weight andreduced Body Mass Index (BMI) scores. Treatment I participants whodieted with hypnosis only lost weight and reduced BMI, but lostsignificantly less weight and BMI than participants treated with overtaversion followed by diet and hypnosis (II). The total sample, I, and IIfindings strongly replicated earlier studies. Participants were offered I, II,and a third (III) program of overt aversion, then hypnosis, diet, nutritionalanalyses, and vitamin/mineral supplements. Participants in II and III lostsignificantly more weight and reduced BMI more than participants in I.Nonsmokers in II and III lost significantly more weight and reduced BMImore than nonsmokers in I. Nonsmokers selected II more often, lostweight and reduced BMI more than smokers in II. Smokers selected Imore often than II and III, but lost more weight on average thannonsmokers in III. Obese participants lost more weight and reduced BMIsignificantly more than overweight participants in the total sample, II,and III.This field study investigated the respective merits of three, multi-component, weight loss treatment programs. First, the study proposed toreplicate the clinical studies, weight-loss, and Body Mass Index (BMI)findings reported earlier (Johnson, 1997; Johnson & Karkut, 1996). Willclients in a multi-component (diet, aversive imagery, hypnosis, be-havioral management, counseling, and audiocassette support) weight lossprogram with an emphasis on overt aversion, then diet and hypnosis, losemore weight and reduce BMI scores more than clients in a multi-component program focused on maintaining a low-calorie diet withhypnosis?

Will clients who useovert aversion, hypnosis, a customized diet and supplements lose weightand reduce BMI scores more than participants in two treatment programs without supplements? In a comparative study (Johnson, 1997) ofsmoking and nonsmoking participants, adult females in a hypnosis-onlytreatment achieved highly significant pre- to post-weight losses andreductions in BMI. No statistically significant differences were foundbetween smokers and nonsmokers. Because of the research and programdevelopmentinterestsinhealth,tobacco cessation,andnutritionsurrounding smoking and body fat, we looked at possible differences intwo subgroups. We compared the use and relative effectiveness of threetreatment programs on samples of smokers and BMI classified(overweight and obese) clients. Will overweight and obese nonsmokerslose more weight than overweight and obese smokers? Will obeseparticipants lose weight and reduce BMI scores more than overweightparticipants by the end of each program?METHODParticipantsOver 400 adult female participants were solicited by newspaper advertisements for weight-control services and scheduled for con-sultations at a private community mental health clinic. After consultation,a total of 388 participants currently not involved in any weight-control,medication, or vitamin/mineral supplement program were scheduled fortreatment. Each client selected and paid a clinic fee to participate in oneweight-control program. Participants started in either a hypnosis only(n=140), an overt aversion and hypnosis (n=140) or a overtaversion, hypnosis, and nutritional supplement program (n=108). Thetotal sample's mean age was 40.3 yr., the mean height was 64.8 in. (1.7m) and mean starting weight was 169.7 lb. (77.0 kg). The starting meanBMI, computed by taking body weight in kilograms divided by height inmeters squared, yielded a total sample mean of 28.4 or approximately28% overweight (Rowland, 1989).MeasureParticipantscompletedquestionnairesdetailingweighthistory,current height and weight, problem foods and drinks, diet, smoking andhealth information. Only participants in the Overt Aversion and Hypnosis(OAH) and Combined Overt Aversion, Hypnosis, and Supplements(COAHS) treatments provided examples of tastes, smells, textures,colors, and animals they viewed as disgusting. Participants were weighedwithout shoes on thesame scale on the first day of treatment and weeklythereafter before treatment and at a closing review session. Johnson & BrinkerWEIGHT LOSS15 ProcedureThe clinician discussed a low-fat, 1200-1500 calories a day dietapproved by the client and client's physician with the participants in theHypnosis Only (HO) treatment on the second hypnosis session during thefirst week of the program. The diet was discussed with participants in theOAH treatment program at the first hypnosis session during the secondweek of the program. The clinician reviewed the nutritional analysis anddiet prior to the first hypnosis session after a series of four overt aversionsessions had been completed in the first week of COAHS treatment.All participants were administered hypnosis treatments in a quietclinic room while resting in a comfortable recliner. All participantsreceived the same hypnosis content and format used in the threetreatment programs. All participants received a self-hypnosis routinebefore the second hypnosis treatment. Each participant received a copy ofthe routine to practice outside the clinic before meals and when thinkingabout or in the presence of foods and drinks. All hypnosis and aversiontreatments were administered by the same clinician. All clinic par-ticipants received the same 90-minute audiocassette of inductions,visualization routines, suggestions, and weight management segmentscovered in the program. Participants were instructed to listen to the tapeand practice the cognitive routines learned in each program before theirscheduled review session. The procedures, diet and treatments used wereidentical to those reported earlier (c.f., Johnson & Karkut, 1996) with theexception of the COAHS treatment's nutritional component.Treatment Program IHypnosis Only. Participants were hypnotizedindividually using a standard relaxation induction (e.g., Johnson &Karkut, 1994). During each hypnosis treatment participants were givensuggestions referencing the negative consequences of eating high-fat orproblematic foods (e.g., candy, desserts, french fries, pork ribs) not onthe diet or excess quantities of acceptable foods and drinks. Suggestionswere given to support personal attractiveness, health, physical exercise,self-esteem,confidence and commitment to self-regulation,stressreduction,and cognitive-behavioral management of weight goals.Participants in this treatment were scheduled to receive two hypnosissessions thefirst week. The diet and self-hypnosis routines werediscussed before and suggested during the second hypnosis session.Weekly hypnosis sessions (M= 30 min.) were scheduled for the following three weeks with the audiocassette given after the fifthtreatment. An exit session with a hypnosis option was scheduledapproximately 10 days after the fifth treatment for review of progress,trouble-shooting, use of the audiocassette, and support. The meanduration of treatment from pre- to post-measures was 31.8 days. 16NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Treatment Program IIOvert Aversion and Hypnosis. Participants inthis treatment were instructed to bring to the clinic the day before eachscheduled aversion session during the first week at least five categoriesof highly desirable, problem foods (e.g., hot dogs, ice cream, chocolatecake, jellies, syrups, doughnuts) and drinks (e.g., soda, beer, milkshakes). Participants were asked to provide at least five or more cups ofeach problem category so the clinician could prepare the samples for thenext day's scheduled aversion treatment. Participants were told the foodand drink samples would be prepared, presented, tasted, and smelled, butnot eaten, in an aversive procedure using an electric shock device.For each aversion session the participant sat in a chair facing a tableon which was placed a paper plate, containers of sample foods anddrinks, a plastic spoon, and an electric shock device. All samples used intreatment had been prepared by coating them with a mixture of whitevinegar and mouthwash to mask the item's taste and smell and to enhancethe overt aversiveness of the treatment.Participants were instructed to stare at the plate while the cliniciandescribed the use and safety of a small electric shock device with anadjustable control and two metal electrodes embedded in a Velcro cuff.Electrode gel was applied to the participant's dominant eating hand at thewrist. The cuff was attached securely. Starting at a milliamp reading of0.0, a level was established within the range of .3 to .9 when a painless,but annoying, involuntary hand movement was elicited by the clinician.Participants were told to place a spoonful of food or drink on the tongue,then close their mouth and eyes. While moving and tasting, but notswallowing the sample, participants were encouraged to shout mentally,'Make it horrible. Make it disgusting. See it turn into fat.' Each categoryof food and drink presented for treatment was used for at least three trialsduring each session. Each participant was shocked from 7 to 11 times atrandom during each trial.Each category of food and drink was pairedwith disgusting imagery (e.g., roaches, rat droppings, snakes, spiders)and sickening experiences (e.g., gagging, vomiting) provided by theparticipant from their aversion questionnaire. These aversive imageswere used as part of the treatment. Participants were directed to verbalizeanger, frustration, and disgust at starchy, greasy, sugary, and artificiallycolored foods and drinks before purging them in a garbage pail settingnext to the table. The mean duration of treatment was 30.1 days.Treatment Program IIICombined Overt Aversion, Hypnosis, andSupplements.Each participant in this treatment permitted the clinicianto take a sample of hair equivalent to one tablespoon along with currentdietary information at the initial interview. Participants received the sameovert aversion treatment as OAH participants during the first week of theprogram and weeklyhypnosissessionsthereafter.The COAHS Johnson & BrinkerWEIGHT LOSS17 participant'ssampleanddietaryinformationwereanalyzedin-dependently by a laboratory and a certified nutritionist who prepared awrittenreportforeachclient.Theclinicianreviewedthere-commendations in the report with the client prior to the first hypnosissession after the scheduled series of overt aversion sessions had beencompleted. Each individualized report focused on dietary areas withpotentialhealthrisksand deficiencies(e.g.,insufficientcalcium,magnesium, iron, zinc, chromium; too much sodium; more vitamins B,C, E ). A list of foods and drinks to avoid and specific others to includein the diet were part of the report. Recommendations for vitamin/mineralenriched foods, drinks, and supplements to support nutritional health andstable eating patterns were offered. Participants reported on the weeklyuse of supplements during the program. At the review session they wereencouraged to follow their diet guidelines with periodic medical andnutritional reassessments. The mean duration of treatment was 31.8 days.RESULTSA summary of the data used for statistical analyses including t ratiosfor correlated samples on pre- and post-weights and pre- and post-BMIscores for the total sample and by treatment are provided in Table 1. Analpha of .01 was used for all statistical tests. The total sample's pre- toTABLE 1 Summary of Means and t Ratios for Weight (lb) and BMIScores for Total Sample samples**p < .001post-weight mean difference of 10.7 lb.(4.9 kg) was highly significant(t387 = 40.1, p< .001). Each treatment program's pre- to post-weightscores: Treatment Group I mean difference of 9.4 lb. (4.3 kg); Treatment 18NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Group II mean difference of 11.3 lb. (5.1 kg); Treatment Group III meandifference of 11.5 lb. (5.2 kg) were all highly significant (p< .001). Allbut six of the 388 participants lost weight, ranging from 1 (.5 kg) to 32pounds (14.5 kg.), during the course (M = 31.4 days) of treatment. Afterweight-loss treatment, the entire sample scored a consistent, average dropin BMI (M = 1.8). The decline in BMI was highly significant statistically(p< .001) across all three treatments and paralleled the pre- to post-weight findings.TABLE 2 ANOVA of Number of Pounds Lost by H - 1.9*.62& Treatment III 2.1*.66Treatment II & Treatment III -.2.66Bonferroni used for all multiple comparisons in this study.*p < .01A one-way analysis of variance was used to test for differences in theindependent variables of age, height, starting weight, starting BMI,number of treatment sessions, and number of days in a weight-lossprogram. There were no significant baseline differences among the threetreatment groups on age, height, starting weight, number of treatmentsessions, or days in a weight loss program. The mean differencesbetween starting BMI scores were significant (F2385 = 4.3, p < .01).Treatment groups I (M = 27.4) and II (M = 29.2) yielded the greatestdifference in starting BMI.The dependent variables of total number of pounds lost and reductionin BMI scores were calculated by subtracting respectively the post-weight from the pre-weight scores and the post-BMI from the pre-BMIscores.The ANOVA results, displayed in Table 2, for the three Johnson & BrinkerWEIGHT LOSS19 treatment groups on the dependent variable number of pounds lost werestatistically significant (F2,385= 6.5, p< .01). The Treatment I mean of9.4 lb. (4.3 kg) was significantly different (p< .01) from the Treatment IImean (11.3 lb./5.1 kg) and Treatment III mean (11.5 lb./5.2 kg). TheTreatment II and III mean difference was not significant. TABLE 3 ANOVA of Reduction in BMI by Treatments NMean BMISDStd. Treatment II .323*.11& Treatment III - .346* .11Treatment II & Treatment III - .023 .11**p < .01 Because of the significant differences between treatment groups onstarting BMI, analyses of covariance were performed on each dependentvariable, that is, on pounds lost and on ending BMI, to statisticallycontrol for possible effects of this initial participant variable on treatmentoutcomes. The covariate and dependent variables analyzed met theassumptions of ANCOVA regarding reliability of covariates, linearity,homogeneity, normality, sample size, and outliers (Tabachnick & Fidell,1989). The analysis of covariance of pounds lost by treatment withstarting BMI as covariate was statistically insignificant. The results forthe adjusted mean differences among the treatment groups on pounds lostfollowed the same pattern of results reported for the ANOVA (Table 2).The analysis of covariance on the reduction of BMI scores by treatmentwith starting BMI as covariate was statistically insignificant. The ad-justed mean differences among the treatment groups followed the samepattern of results for BMI reported in Table 3. 20NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Table 4 summarizes the results for t-test comparisons betweensmokers and nonsmokers in the total sample and for each treatment onthe dependent variables pounds lost and reduction in BMI scores over thecourse of treatment. Nonsmoking participants (n = 251) lost an averageof .6lb.(.3 kg) more than a smaller group (n=137) of smokingparticipants. The difference was not statistically significant. There wasan insignificant difference in mean pounds (2.0 lb./.9 kg) lost betweensmokers and nonsmokers in Treatment II favoring nonsmokers. Thisfinding suggests that some of the mean difference in the total sample mayhave been due to Treatment II's greater impact on nonsmoking subjects'weight loss than smokers in this treatment. Examination of the dif-ferences between smokers and nonsmokers in pounds lost by treatmentscompared to the total sample results by treatments (TABLE 2.) yielded apattern similar for nonsmokers, but not for smokers. Smokers presenteda small mean difference between Treatments I and II, but a largerdifference between Treatments II and III. Participants who smoked lost agreater mean number of pounds in Treatment III than did nonsmokingparticipants. TABLE 4Summary of Means and t Ratios for Pounds Lost and BMIfor Total Sample, Smoking Status, and TreatmentsTotal SampleGroup IN=388n nsnsnsnstb = t ratio for independent samples The results for the mean reduction in BMI across the three treatmentgroups yielded a pattern for nonsmokers similar to the original ANOVA(Table 3), but not for smokers. The mean difference (.3) in reduction in Johnson & BrinkerWEIGHT LOSS21 BMI between smokers and nonsmokers in Treatment II was insignificant.Smokers did not, on average, reduce their BMI as much as nonsmokersin Treatment II by program's end.When participants'treatmentchoiceswerecross-tabulatedbysmoking status, a highly significant (X2 = 13.4, df = 2, p < .001)distribution of choices resulted. Nonsmokers chose Treatment I (29.5%), Treatment II (39.8 %), Treatment III (30.7 %), but smokers choseTreatment I (48.2 %), Treatment II (29.2%), Treatment III (22.6%).Clearly a higher percentage of smokers chose Treatment IoverTreatments II and III. Treatment II was the choice preferred bynonsmokers.Analysis of variance of pounds lost by treatment program fornonsmokers (Table 5) was similar to the pattern of results reported in forthe total sample. Nonsmokers who participated in Treatment II hadsignificantly (p < .01) higher mean weight losses (11.9 lb./5.5 kg) thannonsmokers in Treatment I (9.1 lb./4.1 kg). Nonsmokers in Treatment IIIhad higher mean weight losses (11.3 lb./5.1 kg) than nonsmokers inTreatment I, but the mean difference was not statistically significant.Therewerenosignificantdifferencesfornonsmokers betweenTreatments II and III. TABLE 5 ANOVA of Total Number of Pounds Lost II & III2.01.25.6.78*p < .01Analysis of variance of pounds lost by treatment program for smokersdisplayed some differences from nonsmokers. Comparing the sample 22NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY mean differences for smokers among the treatment groups (Table 5)yielded variations, but no statistically significant findings. Smokersdisplayed a slightly larger mean difference in pounds lost (2.2 lb./1 kg)between Treatments I and III than between Treatments II and III (2 lb./.9kg).The smokers' slender mean difference of .1 lb. (.1 kg) betweenTreatments I and II did not match the nonsmokers' statistically significant(p< .01) mean difference of 2.8 lb.(1.3 kg) between Treatments I and II.Smokers achieved a larger mean difference between Treatments I and III.The greatest difference between smokers and nonsmokers occurred inTreatment II. For nonsmokers, as well as the total sample, the differencein total pounds lost between Treatments I and II was greater than thedifference between Treatments II and III. TABLE 6 Summary of Means and t Ratios for Pounds Lost and BMIfor Total Sample, BMI Status, and ratio for independent samples*p < .01**p < .001We used the published clinical guidelines on the identification ofoverweight and obese individuals (NIH, 1998) to look for differencesbetween our overweight and obese clients. In order to investigatepossible treatment effectsamong the three programs, we split the sampleinto two subgroups using the National Institute of Health and WorldHealth Organizations' (1998) recommended BMI cut-off point of 30.Participants with initial BMI less than 30 (low to high overweight) were Johnson & BrinkerWEIGHT LOSS23 separated from a comparison group of participants with initial BMI equalto or greater than 30 (low to higher levels of obesity).Table 6 summarizes the t-test results for the overweight and obeseparticipants. For the total sample and each treatment group, obeseparticipants lost more pounds and had higher reductions in BMI scoresthan overweight participants. For the total sample a highly significant(t3865.5, p < .001) number of pounds lost favored obese participantsby a mean difference of 2.9 lb. (1.3 kg). The mean difference in poundslost between overweight and obese participants 1.9 lb. (.8 kg) and thereduction in BMI, mean difference .3, in Treatment I were the onlycomparisons not statistically significant. The mean difference of 2.8 lb.(1.3 kg) in Treatment II was similar to the total sample and highlysignificant (p < .001). Mean differences in BMI reduction for the totalsample and Treatments II and III were significant. A similar pattern ofresults favored obese rather than overweight participants in the reductionof BMI at program's end.An ANOVA of the number of pounds lost by overweight and obeseparticipants by treatments was statistically insignificant. The smallnumber (n = 136) and uneven distribution of obese participants limitedinterpretation except toreport a patternsimilar to Table 6.Foroverweight subjects, the mean differences between treatments wererelatively small and statistically insignificant.DISCUSSIONThe total sample of adult female participants displayed strong,consistent, and highly significant (p < .001) losses from starting toending weights and BMIs. Irrespective of treatments, smoking status, andBMI classification, the total sample averaged 10.7 lb. (4.9 kg) lost and amean BMI reduction of 1.8 points at program's end. Participants hadmean weight losses between 7.6 lb. (3.5 kg) for overweight smokers inTreatment II to 14.8 lb. (6.7 kg) for nonsmokers in Treatment III. Allsubgroups by treatments had statistically significant (p < .01) decreasesfrom pre-weight to post-weight using paired t-tests. This study replicatedthe procedures, treatments, and supported findings reported earlier(Johnson & Karkut, 1996; Johnson, 1997) with two multi-component,weight-loss treatment programs. One treatment program focused onintroducing a low-calorie diet in the first week of the program with onlyhypnosis as the main cognitive-behavioral treatment used. The secondtreatment program focused first on working with problem foods anddrinks in a series of four, intense, aversive treatments followed in thesecond week with an introduction to a low-calorie, reduced-fat diet andweekly hypnosis sessions. The total sample lost 2.4 lb. (1.1 kg) a week,which compares favorably with earlier studies and other short-term, 24NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY weight loss reports. The total sample's average weight-loss exceeded thesuggested standard of 1.2 lb. (.5 kg) a week suggested by Brownell &Wadden (1986) and others.Hypnosis only participants lost significant amounts of weight and hadBMI reductions from start to finish. Even though Treatment I participantsstarted diets on the second session of the first week, 7-10 days earlierthan Treatment II and III participants, the reduction in mean weight andBMI scores were less than Treatment II and III participants.Generally, the data suggest that Treatment II and III consistentlyoutperformed Treatment I participants because they shared the corecomponents of overt aversion followed by hypnosis. In an earlier study(Johnson & Karkut, 1994) of smoking cessation, overt aversion followedby hypnosis treatment was used effectively on the same treatment day.The reverse order, that is, hypnosis first followed by overt aversion, or anovert aversion treatment option only, has not been studied by theinvestigators. However, these versatile treatment components have beenadapted to different clinical, research, and self-instructional purposes (c.f.Johnson & Johnson, 2000).Treatment III,in additionto the overt aversion and hypnosiscomponents, introduced participants to dietetic consultation, laboratoryanalysis, and specific nutritional targets in order to look beyond dailycalorie counting and a singular focus on weight loss. The perspective wasonweightlossandunderlyinghealth,nutrition,exercise,andmanagement issues in support of weight maintenance. A nutritionally-sounddietandindividualizedgoalswereaddressedwithre- commendations to use specific foods, drinks, and vitamin/mineralsupplements. Treatment III yielded a slight, insignificant edge in poundslost and concurrent reduction in BMI over Treatment II participants. TheTreatment III statistical results did not suggest strong, independentvariable effects on the dependent measures in the short term.Obese participants lost more pounds and reduced BMI scores morethan nonobese participants in all treatments. Obese participants lost morepounds and reduced BMI scores more in Treatments II and III than inTreatment I.But, obese participants lost more weight on average (M =10.7 lb./4.9 kg) than nonobese participants in Treatment I. The meanreduction in BMI favored obese over non-obese participants in TreatmentIII and respectively smaller differences in BMI appeared to favor obeseover nonobese participants in Treatments II and I. For overweightparticipants, there were no statistically significant treatment differences.A review of the total sample's distribution of participants bytreatment, smoking status, and BMI classification, yielded a largernumber (n = 252) of overweight than obese participants in all treatments and a smaller number (n= 136) and uneven distribution of obese 0)1..' Johnson & BrinkerWEIGHT LOSS25 participants by treatments. A greater number (n = 25) and percentage(52.8 %) of obese clients who smoked participated in Treatment I. Amuch larger number (n = 72) and percentage (81.8%) of obese non-smokers preferred Treatments II and III which limited comparisons ofoverweight and obese participants by smoking status.The study replicates and provides empirical support for the consistentclinical weight-loss results by treatment and initial BMI classification.Our prediction would be the greater the starting weight, the moreparticipants will lose in pounds and BMI. Obese participants will losemore than overweight participants across treatments. The findingssuggest that the more cognitive-behavioral management and nutritionalcomponents available in an effective weight-loss program, the moreappeal to a broader range of overweight participants. If it can be shownthat these components enhance weight loss, that is, add to the number ofpounds lost, reduce BMI scores, and improve nutrition, then theseeffective components placed in the most workable order for treatmentshould result in a greater probability of high participant motivation,participation, and rate of weight loss. The more participants perceiveprogram components as connected to their weight-loss issues andrelevant to their weight goals, the greater the motivation and participationfrom individuals at overweight and early to medium obesity levels ofstarting weight. But what about smokers?Comparisons between smokers and nonsmokers on pounds lost andreduction in BMI yielded the following. The total sample (n = 251) ofnonsmoking participants lost on average (M = .6 lb./.3 kg) more poundsand had a reduced difference in BMI scores (M = .1) greater thanparticipants who smoked (n = 137). In Treatment II nonsmokers lostmore pounds (mean difference = 2.0 lb./1 kg) and reduced BMI scores(M = .3) more than smokers. Smokers tended to lose pounds and reduceBMI more than nonsmokers in Treatments I and III. Nonsmokers lost onaverage more pounds in Treatments II and III than Treatment I. Smokerslost more pounds on average in Treatment III, but participated more inTreatment I over II and III. The relatively equal performance in weightloss and reduction in BMI in the Hypnosis Only treatment replicated anearlier study's (Johnson, 1997) findings for smokers and nonsmokers.We were unable to find studies of female smokers participating inweight-loss programs for comparative purposes. In this study smokerslost weight with each treatment program, but the unequal distribution ofobese smoking participants across treatments precluded any generalstatement.Why the relatively higher rate of weight loss and uneven participationof smokers in Treatments I and III compared to Treatment II participantsand nonsmokers? Female participants who smoke may perceive smoking31 26NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY as more important to the management of moods, thoughts (Waters, 2000)appetite, energy, body weight, or self-image than the elimination ofproblem foods/drinks and their management with aversion, informedfood/drink choices, and supplements. From this study we would predicta lower percentage of female smokers would choose a weight lossprogram which emphasized only the latter components. If participantswho smoke viewed the overt aversion treatment component to be toointense, given the already stress-inducing or aversive properties (Parrott,1999) of smoking, they may have opted first for the stress-reducing,hypnotic, relaxation, and potential sleep benefits in Treatment I. TheTreatment I option was presented with less explicit emphasis on aversionand the identification of problem foods/drinks.Since many smokers eat high-caloric meat, fat consumables, lessfruits and vegetables with antioxidants, beta-carotene, vitamins C and E(Ma, 2000) without gaining weight (Perkins, 1992), smokers who beginto gain weight may have been sufficiently concerned to seek treatment.Upon entering treatment, they may have not realized the smoking and fatconnections with food, drink, and behavior management (Mikhailidis,1998). They may have wanted to hold on to the smoking habit, hoping\"it\" would continue to provide a metabolic lift via release of serotonin(Wurtman & Wurtman, 1995) to manage stress along with fatteningfoods and drinks(e.g.,alcohol, caffeinated beverages) devoid ofnutritional value. Many of the participants who smoked may have optedfor Treatment I rather than use the overt aversion component.The overt aversion sessions used in Treatments II and III wereacknowledged verbally as disgusting by participants during each session.Participants were sickened by responses to problem foods and drinks aswell as when aversive responses were repeated. Also, clients werereinforced by the clinician who paired aversive responses with foods anddrinks provided and targeted by participants. Aversive responses were repeated with the aid of each participant's list of problem foods,disgusting items, and sickening experiences. Regardless of smokingstatus, no participant in the overt aversion sessions asked for moresessions; nor, did any participant request an extra overt aversion sessionat review.Afterparticipantscompletedastressful,aversioncomponent,participants who smoked in Treatment III may have perceived less threatand reduction in stress. They may have gained confidence, then acceptedsupplements as rewards for their participation, health, nutrition, andpsychological well being.All participants in Treatment III may haveshared in these perceived benefits, but smokers coping with weight andsmoking issues may have received an extra boost in the short-term fromthesequalitativebenefits.Since regularsmokingdepletes many3 9(A, Johnson & and exhausts daily vitamin requirements, smokingparticipants typically had more mineral and vitamin deficiencies. Theybenefited from supplements like antioxidant vitamins B, C, E and theamelioration of some toxic effects of daily smoking. Vitamins C and Ehave been reported (Miller, 1997; Gamble, 2000) to have positive effectson the cardiovascular, respiratory, and circulatory systems of individualswho smoke, even while smoking. A complete B-complex may havehelped stressed out participants who smoked relax, stabilize mood, andimprovereceptivityforsubsequenthypnosisandself-hypnosiscomponents. Supplements may have positively affected participants'weight loss in Treatment III by reducing mineral imbalances. Correctedmineral imbalances for overweight smokers included: (1) An improvedratio of sodium to potassium which allowed a natural release of retainedwater and reduction of sodium. More potassium would support thecoordination and efficient use of large muscles in daily activities andexercise with less cramping and fatigue. (2) More chromium may havehelpedstabilizeparticipantswithfluctuatingblood sugarlevels,hypoglycemia, mood (see \"tired arousal\" in Gold, et al., 1995), appetiteswings, and other precursors of Type II diabetes mellitus (NationalInstitutes of Health, 1998).In the short run, Treatment III benefits may have helped smokerscope with nutritional, fitness, and health issues associated with smoking,lower rates of weight lost, and BMI reduction. Smokers who choseTreatment I did not receive the overt aversive component, supplements,and prospective treatment benefits. Overweight and obese smokers inTreatment III lost on average 2-3 lb. more than overweight and obesesmokers in Treatment I.When we focus on weight-loss participants who regularly smoke, theresults by treatment and initial BMI classification are not consistentlysupported and remain generally untested. Nonsmokers lost on averagemore weight and had greater reductions in BMI when compared withparticipants who smoked in all treatments for obesity and especially inTreatment II. A slight reversal of results occurred in favor of overweight(BMI < 30.0) smokers losing slightly more weight on average thanoverweight nonsmoking participants in Treatments I and III. Questionson how tocontrolfor self-reported smoking rates and smokers'participation in weight loss and BMI studies have not been resolved (c.f.,Calle, 1999). We believe the unexpected weight losses by smokerswarrant further systematic study. How the complexities of metabolism,weight gains and losses interface with the daily exigencies of personscaught up in a smoking cycle who want to lose weight before, or insteadof, smoking cessation deserve further systematic study and innovativeprogram applications. 28NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The overweight BMI classification itself might have accounted forsome participation by smokers in treatment, for it is the class in whichsymptoms first appear in association with health risks, co-morbid, andlipid-relatedconditions.Depression,glucoseintolerance,diabetesmellitus II,hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and other cardiovascularindicators can often be associated with the overweight classification. Westrongly recommend that clinicians and health-care providers shareinformation on BMI, health risks, and associated co-morbid conditionsthat emerge with unwanted weight gains and associated tobaccosmoking. We want to encourage and support tobacco cessation beforeanyone starts a weight loss program. In the absence of tobacco cessation,we hope clinicians and prospective clients would consider effectiveweight-loss treatments modeled on one or more of the three effectivetreatmentsoutlinedherein. We have some optimism that clinicalresearch, modest weight loss, BMI reductions, nutritional support, andweight-loss maintenance can work towards clients' tobacco cessation,enhanced health, fitness, and positive lifestyle changes.Obese participants in the study may have experienced many chronicmetabolic signs including more past problems with specific foods anddrinks which,inpart, may have strengthened and focused theirmotivation for treatment, especially Treatments II and III. If overweightparticipants and overweight smokers in the study became acutely awareof multiple risk factors, it may have accounted for stronger motivation toenter and complete weight-loss treatment. Participants in our study werenot randomly assigned to treatment so more systematic, controlledstudies are needed to test these hypotheses. The literature stronglysuggests that the underlying health and fitness of weight-loss participantsincluding smokers at every BMI level, plus lifestyle conditions outsidethe clinic walls, must fill in significant pieces to the weight-loss puzzle.The twin, major preventable epidemics of obesity and tobacco addictioncontinue to thrive in our expanding sedentary lifestyle, population, andglobal environment.

Isaksen and Kenneth J. LauerCreative Problem Solving Group Buffalo The purpose of this study was to continue examining the validity of theSituational Outlook Questionnaire (SOQTM). The relationship betweenmean ratings of the nine dimensions that make up the Situational OutlookQuestionnaire and the self-perception of the organizational climate asconducive (or not conducive) to creativity was tested with a sample of1,830 individuals from a variety of organizations. Participants werecategorized on their level of perceived support for creativity. The resultsindicated that the means of all nine dimensions of the Situational OutlookQuestionnaire were different for each level of perceived support forcreativity in the work environment. The difference was statisticallysignificant for each level. The results of this study indicated that theSituational Outlook Questionnaire may be able to discriminate effectivelyamong differentlevels of perceived support for creativity intheimmediate work environment.The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between anindividual's perceptions of the degree of support for their personalcreativity and the climate for creativity and change where they work. ThestudyutilizedamodifiedversionoftheSituationalOutlookQuestionnaire (SOQTM) to conduct the inquiry. The SOQ is a paper andpencil instrument intended for use as a diagnostic tool to improveawareness and understanding of the organization's ability to supportcreativity and change. It is conceptually grounded in previous empiricaland theoretical work on creativity and innovation (Drucker, 1985;Ekvall, 1996; Lauer, 1994).The basic theoretical model underlying the SOQ proposes thatcreative productivity, in any context, is dependent upon numerousindividual, group, and organizational variables. These variables combineto influence the patterns of behavior in any work environment. Theserecurring patterns, as well as their underlying attitudes and feelings,characterize the atmosphere or \"quality of life\" within an organizationand do CreativeProblem Solving Group-Buffalo; 1325 No. Forest Rd., Suite 340, Williamsville,NY 14221. cpsb@cpsb.comNorth American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 31-40.NAJP 32NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Ekvall (1991) asserted that climate acts as an intervening variable inan organization. Climate influences, and is subsequently influenced by,the outcome of organizational operations. Climate affects outcomes byinfluencing organizational processes such as problem solving, decisionmaking, communicating and coordinating, the individual processes oflearning and creating, and levels of motivation and commitment. These inturn influence the ways in which the organization uses its resources, suchas people, buildings, intellectual property and funds. These effectssubsequently become apparent in the quality of the products or servicesproduced, whether these are radically new products, minor improvementsof old ones, job satisfaction, productivity, profit, or emotional andphysical well-being. These factors, in turn, affect both the availability ofresources and the climate itself (See Figure 1).

The climate within organ-izations that stimulates creative productivity has been the subject ofincreasing attention and research (Amabile & Gryskiewicz, 1989). Isaksen, Lauer, & Winsemius VALIDITY OF SOQ33 This study was designed to examine the nature of the relationshipbetween individuals' perceptions of support for their personal creativityand their results on the nine dimension scores of the SOQ. Our specificresearch interest was in determining whether a significant relationshipexisted between the individual's perception of the supportiveness of theirown immediate work environment for creativity and each of the ninedimensions of the SOQ.METHODParticipantsThe study used data from 1,830 individuals; of these 1,469 weremembers of organizations that contracted for training courses in CreativeProblem Solving (CPS) with the Creative Problem-Solving GroupBuffalo (CPS-B), while 361 were participants in educational and or-ganizational research samples.Regarding sex, 54.8% were male, 45.2% were female. The mean ageof those respondents (n = 977) who reported their age was 35.3 years with a range of 17 to 64 years. The educational level of the sample,reported by 762 subjects, was spread over the following groups:completed high school (n=21), some college education (n = 134),bachelor's degree (n = 249), some graduate education (n=22), master'sdegree (n = 177), and doctorate (n = 159).Participants came from a wide range of organizational levels andfunctions. The majority of participants included in this study came from six organizations (n = 1,469), while the remaining subjects wereundergraduate students who had previously attended courses on creativity(n = 195), attended educational conferences (n = 122), or attended five-day creative problem-solving courses (n = 44). Participants represented avariety organizations, namely: 74%' from Business/Goods Industries(n = 1354), 3% from Education (n = 55), .6% from the Government orService sector (n = 9), 10.7% were college students (n = 196), and 11.8%did not specify their type of organization (n = 216).The majority of the participants in the Business/Goods Industrycategory came from two large international organizations. Severalcourses were conducted at a petroleum company, accounting for a total of755 respondents, or 41.3% of the total sample. Programs conducted for aconsumer products manufacturer provided another 528 subjects, or 28.9% designed to assess nine aspects of organizational climatethat either foster or hinder creative behavior and organizational change. 34NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The initial translation of the questionnaire from Swedish to English beganin 1986. Two independent Swedish translators then used a process knownas back translation with decentering to adjust the initial translation(Bontempo, 1993). The English translation was then reviewed for facevalidity using a Q-sort by the initial translation team, and six creativityresearchers, one from India, two from Norway, and three from the USA.The questionnaire that resulted from this translation process wassimilar to Ekvall's CCQ in that it contained five items for each of the 10theoretical dimensions. The senior author then used this as a researchinstrument. Data collected from 419 individuals who completed this first50-item version of the SOQ were analyzed by Lauer (1994). Anexploratory principal component analysis (Varimax rotation) revealed 10factors with an eigenvalue equal to or greater than 1.0 and accounted for62.1% of the total variance. Examination of the delineation of items inthe Varimax rotation did show some inconsistency with the theoreticalloading patterns. The coefficient alphas for the sample ranged from .72 to.87 for the 10 theoretically based factors. A study by Isaksen andKaufmann (1990) reported similar coefficient alphas for a sample of 634individuals.Following this initial translation and analysis process, the SOQ wastested and refined on four different versions of the measure. This processis described in more detail in the technical manual (Isaksen, Lauer,Murdock, Dorval, & Puccio, 1995) and Cabra's thesis (1996). The intentof this refinement process was to improve the factor structure andcoefficient alphas. Exploratory factor analysis supported a nine-factorprincipal axis (oblique rotation) factor structure rather than the 10 factorprincipal component (varimax rotation) structure reported by Ekvall,Arvonen, and Waldenstrom-Lindblad (1983). This nine factor structure isreported by Isaksen, Lauer, & Ekvall (1999) in a study of 1,111individuals who used the fourth version of the SOQ. Coefficient alphasfor the nine factors ranged from .62 to .89. Further studies of the SOQ'sreliability and validity have been conducted (Britz, is intended for adult respondents. Flesch Reading Easescores for the questionnaire instructions and the items were 54.4 and 59.3respectively. This converts to a USA grade-school reading level of 8.3for the instructions and 7.6 for the items.In 1996 the SOQ was made available for use with groups andorganizations. However, because of the multidimensional nature andintended use of the questionnaire, it must be administered and debriefedby individuals whoare qualified and trained to use the theory andmeasure for effective interventions. Isaksen, Lauer, & Winsemius VALIDITY OF SOQ35 The SOQ version used in this study consisted of positive dimensions(Challenge,Freedom,IdeaSupport,Playfulness/Humor,Debate,Trust/Openness, Risk-taking, and Idea Time) which tend to foster a morecreative climate. The Conflict dimension, as defined, is considered to bedetrimental to creativity in the workplace. It is important to distinguishConflict from Debate. Conflict focuses on negative emotional andpersonal tensions, whereas Debate centers upon differences of ideas,viewpoints, and individually unique experiences and knowledge. Bothdimensions incorporate tension; debate pertains to idea tension, whileconflict entails personal tension.The version used in this study contained five items for each of thenine SOQ dimensions and the omnibus question cited later in this section.Of the 46 items, 22 items are reverse scored to control for response bias.The items are framed in such a manner that they ask the respondent to bean objective observer of the environment in which he/she is working.Respondents answer the items on a 4-point scale in which 0 = Not at allapplicable, 1 = Applicable to some extent, 2 = Fairly applicable, 3 =Applicable to a high degree. The overall scores for each dimension arecalculated by taking the mean of the participant's response for eachdimension and multiplying this by 100. All dimensions therefore, have atheoretical range from 0 to 300. This procedure allows for ease ofcomparison across dimensions. The coefficient alphas for and Idea Time, .81.Studies of validity have used demographic grouping and/or self-reportresponses as a means of classifying respondents into meaningfulgroupings (Litwin & Stringer, 1968; Sackett & Larson, 1990; Taylor &Gryskiewicz, 1993). In this study an omnibus question was used toclassify respondents into meaningful groups. The question was phrased:\"I feel the immediate work environment is supportive of my personalcreativity.\" The respondents were divided into four groups depending ontheir responses to this question. The group of participants who had scoredtheir environment as \"not supportive\" was labeled Not Supportive (n201). Those in the second group found their immediate work environmentconducive to their creativity \"to some extent\" and are labeled To SomeExtent (n = 609). The third group consisted of respondents who hadanswered the omnibus question with \"fairly applicable\" and are labeledFairly Supportive (n = 702). Finally, those in fourth group said that thedescription was \"applicable to a high degree\" to their work environmentand are labeled Highly Supportive (n = 318). 36NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY ProcedureAll participants completed the questionnaire individually focusingtheirresponses ontheirperception of theirimmediate workingenvironment. The SOQ was distributed through the various organizationsmail systems along with a memorandum describing the purpose of themeasure. The participants from educational and organizational researchstudies were given the questionnaire by the senior author in classroomsettingsandthequestionnaireswerecollectedimmediately uponcompletion. Completed instruments were then returned to the CPS-B forscoring and analysis. Steps were taken to ensure voluntary participationand confidentiality. TABLE 1 SOQ Means and SDs Sorted by Support of the ImmediateWork Environment to Personal Creativity With p values < .001 RESULTSThe means and standard deviations of the four groups on eachdimension, as presented in Table 1, indicate that the scores on all theSOQ dimensions increased as the individuals perceived their immediatework environment as more supportive to their personal creativity (exceptfor the Conflict dimension, which decreased). To determine if differences Isaksen, Lauer, & Winsemius VALIDITY OF SOQ37 were statistically significant between the four groups, we conducted aone-way multivariateanalysisof variance (MANOVA). This wasfollowed by variance (ANOVA' s) for the ninedimensions to determine the strength and statistical significance of thedifferences among all four categories on each dimension. The MANOVAresults were statistically significant [Wilks's A = .46, F(3,1826) = 53.54,p < .001]. The subsequent one-way ANOVA's (See Table 1) showed thatthis effect was statistically significant for all dimensions. The F-value foreach dimension was statistically significant at p < .001. The magnitude ofthe effect sizes as measured via R- were all greater than .26 and may beconsidered large (Cohen, 1977).DISCUSSIONThe preceding results provide evidence that a statistically significantdifference does exist between the respondents' reports of perceivedsupport for creativity and the scores for the SOQ dimensions. The resultsshow that individuals who perceive their immediate work environment asmore supportive of their creativity report higher mean scores on thosedimensions of the SOQ that are positively related to the creative climate.Lower mean scores were observed for the Conflict dimension for thosewho report more support for their personal creativity. This suggests thatthereisa meaningful relationship between the manner in whichindividuals perceive their work environment and how they view theenvironment'sabilitytosupporttheirpersonalcreativityintheorganizational settings included in this study.There are, however, several limitations to this study. First, only asingle item was used to categorize the subject groups. Additionalomnibus items may be added to obtain an improved sense of how therespondents perceive the overall creative climate in their immediate workenvironment. It may also be useful to examine further how the SOQdimensions relate to other measures such as job satisfaction and othermeasures of organizational climate, creative climate, and culture. Forexample, Turnipseed (1994) found that several job satisfaction factorsand social environmental variables are related to the SOQ dimensions.The coefficient alpha of two dimensions is below .70, which iscommonly used as an acceptable baseline for a research instrument(Freedom, .69, and Risk-Taking, .52). The SOQ version used in thisstudy was the third revision. Subsequent revisions of the questionnairehave addressed this issue and improvements have been reported in theliterature (Isaksen, et al., 1999). Future research will continue exploringmeans to improve the questionnaire's reliability.Another limitation to this study is that the ratings of the overallenvironmental support for creativity were measured by self-reports.Additional research using outside observers and a variety of alternative 38NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY measures are needed to further validate the dimensions of creative climateassessed by the SOQ. Further utility can be realized from a study of thisnature if a large random sample were acquired and analyzed, since thefindings and insights could be transferred to other organizational settingswith higher levels of confidence. Finally, since climate is conceived as anattribute of the organization, future validation studies should also focuson organizational performance measures.An additional limitation is that both the criterion measure (omnibusquestion) and the SOQ were combined and completed by respondents atthe same time. Shared method variance may result and this may be anissue in a study of this nature. Further research should take this intoaccount.Despite these limitations this study has many merits. The large samplesize and the wide variety of organizations itcontains provides acomparative base for other studies on the topic to build upon. The samplesize also allows further studies to be conducted that may address howperceived level of support for creativity relates to the type of industry, theintensity of the technology used, and the rate of change of technology inthat industry. These and other questions may also be studied in relation tothe departments within an organization or the functions individualsperform in the organization.In summary, the results of this study coupled with the psychometricfindings of other studies (Isaksen & Lauer, 1999; Isaksen, et al., 1999;Isaksen, et al, 1995) support the continued investigation into the SOQ andhow it can be used to further our understanding of creativity and changein organizational settings.

Alcohol Consumption and Consequences in aSample of University Undergraduates:Patterns and Relations to Internalized Distressand Religious AffiliationJ. M. OliverCynthia K. S. ReedBruce W. SmithSt. Louis UniversityThis study examined self-reports of alcohol use and other psychologicalproblems common in undergraduates in 248 students at a midsize Jesuituniversity using the \"Core Survey,\" designed specifically for un-dergraduates. Drinking and Its Problems emerged as a factor independentof both internalized distress and eating dysfunctions. Drinking and ItsProblems was decomposed into six factors: Heavy Drinking; High-RiskBehaviors; General Role Impairment; Sexual Victimization Due toAlcohol; Aggression Due to Alcohol; and Failing at Quitting. Catholicreligious affiliation, male gender, and on-campus residence significantlypredicted Drinking and Its Problems. Results suggest student drinking isattended by problems and related to Catholic religious affiliation and thatcampus personnel need to know of these relationships.Although rates of consumption among undergraduate students takenas a group are currently stable (Presley, Meilman, & Lyerla, 1993, 1995),investigation of alcohol use in college students remains important.Evidence regarding many fundamental issues regarding student alcoholuse remains inconclusive. Such issues include; whether student drinking,although heavy, is uncomplicated by problems; whether some studentdrinking may resemble alcohol dependence; and whether Catholicreligious affiliationis a risk factor for heavy consumption and/orproblems related to drinking.One of the reasons why evidence about these significant issuesremains inconclusive is that investigators of student drinking have tendedto develop their own instruments for assessing it, making comparisonsacross studies difficult. A second reason is that investigators have beenslow to apply multivariate techniques to the analysis of responses of what is likely the best instrument available for assessing alcohol use instudents, the Core Drug and Alcohol Survey (\"Core Survey\"; Presley etAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: J. M. Oliver, Department ofPsychology, St. Louis University, 208 Shannon Hall, 3544 Laclede Blvd., St.Louis, MO 63103. E- mail to oliverjm@primary.net.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 41-60.NAJP4 7 42NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY al., 1993, 1995). A third reason is that investigators have shown somereluctance to examine the relation between religious affiliation andalcohol use.Patterns of use incollege studentsarestilllittleunderstood.According to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fourth Edition(DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), the characteristicswhich differentiate alcohol use (a normal phenomenon) from alcoholabuse (a mental disorder associated with impairment) are a pattern ofheavy consumption and recurring problems due to heavy consumption.Following DSM-IV, four general classes of problems differentiatebetween heavy consumption unaccompanied by problems and alcoholabuse: failure to fulfill obligations; exposing oneself to a physical hazard(high-risk behaviors); incurring legal problems; and incurring social orinterpersonal problems.The distinction betweenheavy consumption, or \"heavy drinking,\"and problems due to heavy consumption, or alcohol abuse, is important inundergraduates as well as in non-student adolescents and young adults.Although student status is a well-known risk factor for high rates ofconsumption, drinking in college students, or at least one variant of it,may be limited to \"heavy drinking.\" Students may drink heavily duringtheir undergraduate years for experimental and recreational purposeswithout incurring problems related to heavy consumption, then decreasetheir consumption and their risk of developing attendant problems whenthey leave the campus and the student role. By contrast, drinking incollege students, or at least one variant of it, may be associated withproblems just as problems are associated with non-student adolescentsand young adults who drink heavily.The handful of studies which have examined patterns of drinking incollege students (Brennan, Walfish, & AuBuchon, 1986a, 1986b; Brown,1985; Park, 1967) have found from two to 25 patterns or factors of use,of which at least one was generally a heavy-drinking pattern un-complicated by attendant problems. Evidence regarding \"heavy drinking\"in students uncomplicated by problems has been summarized have also found that heavy drinking instudents is not necessarily associated with problems.By contrast,however,the majority of evidence suggeststhatundergraduate drinking is accompanied by 1991;Anderson et al., 1995; Wechsler et al., 1994). A problem of particularconcern ensuing consumption assault (Abbey, 1991; Finley & Corty, 1993).Patterns of alcohol use in undergraduates may include not onlyalcohol use associated with problems but alcohol dependence. Accordingto DSM-IV, the characteristics that differentiate alcohol abuse fromalcohol dependence consist of physiologicaltolerance,withdrawalsymptoms associated with efforts to decrease consumption, and variousmanifestations of compulsive use. Park (1967), who studied patterns ofalcohol use, identified a problem-drinking pattern that might predictfuture alcohol dependence.Some demographicvariablesmay make goodpredictorsofmaladaptive alcohol use and allow students at risk to be identified early.Demographic correlates of alcohol use in undergraduates have beenexamined frequently. The single demographic variable most stronglyassociated with alcohol consumption and with problems associated withalcohol use in college students is gender. A very large body of evidenceindicates that college males drink in larger amounts, with greaterfrequency, and experience problems associated with alcohol use ingreater numbers and with higher severity; for a recent summary of thisevidence, see Engs et al. (1996).Religious affiliation is another demographic variable that is related toalcohol consumption and to associated problems. In general, ack-nowledgment of some religious affiliation irrespective of sect has beenfound to be negatively associated with alcohol consumption (Cherry,1987; Cronin, 1995; Engs et al., 1996). However, data regarding Catholicreligious affiliation as a risk factor for alcohol use are beginning to bepublished (Engs,etal.,1996; Hanson,1977). Catholicreligiousaffiliation has been found to predict both higher levels of consumptionand a higher incidence of problems related to drinking (Engs et al., 1996)and has also been found to be associated with earlier age of initialdrinking (Hanson, 1977). One unpublished study found significantlyhigher rates of consumption among undergraduates at Jesuit institutionsthan among those at non-Jesuit ones (Wernig, 1989).Thus far, studies have examined the association between Catholicreligious affiliation and alcohol consumption in one of two ways: eitherthey have investigated the relation between religious affiliation andalcohol consumption among students at a variety of types of university, 44NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY both sectarian and non-sectarian; or they have compared rates betweenJesuit and non-Jesuit institutions. A third way in which the relationbetween Catholic religiousaffiliation and consumption may be in-vestigated is within a Catholic university where a substantial proportionof non-Catholic students are enrolled.It remains unclear whether alcohol consumption in undergraduatesresults from other behavioral and psychological problems, such asanxiety, depression, and eating problems (Lundholm, 1989; MacDonald,Fleming, Pullen, 1994; Ross & Tisdall, 1994). Drinkingmight be secondary to and might mask other primary problems that wouldneed to be identified early in order to reduce secondary drinking or \"self-medication.\" Conversely, drinking might be a prelude to and culminate inpsychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and/or eatingproblems. In the latter case, alcohol consumption would be a primary problem and would need to be identified early in order to preventsecondary problems from accruing. Some investigators, however, havefoundlittleor no relation between adjustment and consumption(Fondacara & Heller, 1983; Kashubeck & Mintz, 1996; Kim, Lamier,Walker, & Marlatt, 1997).An instrument developed specifically for the study of undergraduatesubstance use is the Core Survey. The Core Survey was developed under the auspices of the Fund for the Improvement of PostsecondaryEducation (FIPSE)togather baseline and trend data incollegepopulations regarding a broad range of facets of substance use and abusein undergraduate students and to allow historical trends to be examined(Presley et al., 1993, 1995). The Core Survey thus examines both alcoholconsumption and consequences of alcohol use.Although the Core Survey has been used to track alcohol consumptionand consequences of alcohol use in college students, including throughtime (Presley et al., 1995), responses to the survey have apparently notyet been examined from a multivariate perspective. The Core Survey thusprovides a unique opportunity to examine the association betweenconsumption and consequences; patterns of use; and the possiblepresence of patterns consistent with alcohol abuse and dependence.Further, responses to the Core Survey have not yet been examined inrelation to religious affiliation; indeed the Core Survey has no iteminquiring about religious affiliation. Thus a striking opportunity toascertain the association between religious affiliation and alcohol use incollege students has so far been neglected.An important feature of the Core Survey is that each questionregarding a potential consequence of alcohol use asks specificallywhether the consequence was experienced as a direct result of alcohol Oliver, Reed, & SmithALCOHOL USE45 use.The Core Survey therefore allows the investigator to discriminatebetween problems that might occur for other reasons and problemsspecific to alcohol use. Another important feature of the Core Survey isthat to some degree it covers all four types of problems that the DSM-IVincludes as problems criticalto alcohol abuse. Although only twoquestions are directedtorole impairment, the areas of high-riskbehaviors, legal problems, and social problems are each covered by aminimum of three questions each. An additional six questions areaddressed to other types of consequences that are not specificallycatalogued in DSM-IV. Another important feature of the Core Survey isthat two items inquire about problems that might pertain to alcoholdependence as distinct from alcohol abuse; for example, one questionasks whether the respondent has already tried unsuccessfully to stop usingalcohol.Our institution, a midsize, private, Catholic, Jesuit university in theMidwest, affords a good setting in which to examine these issues. Weexamined levels of alcohol consumption, consequences of alcoholconsumption,anxiety,depression,physicalsymptoms, andeatingproblems in the same population. This allowed us to investigate thedegree to which these psychological problems common in undergraduatepopulations are risk factors for (as distinct from independent of) alcoholconsumption and consequences of alcohol use. About 70% of ourundergraduates are Catholic, providing an excellent population in whichto study the potential relation between religious affiliation and alcoholuse.METHODParticipantsParticipants were 248 undergraduate volunteers who were recruited ina variety of ways, from phone calls to their residence to solicitation bytheir resident advisor. Although a portion of the sample was randomlyselected, the majority of the sample was not. The participation rate wasapproximately 33%. The type of recruitment of participants and methodof administration (whether group or individual, in a standard lecture-hallor individual residence setting) was recorded.Table 1 displays demographic characteristics of participants. Thetypical participant was female, Caucasian, Catholic, and a full-timestudent. Year levels were almost equally represented.Participants were compared to population statistics for undergraduatesat this university. These comparisons indicated that the sample wasrepresentative of the undergraduate population at this institution in mostways, but that males were proportionally underrepresented. Because we wanted our findings to be as generalizable as possible, we applied a 46NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY TABLE 1 Demographic Characteristics of statistically for under-representation ofmale gender in all subsequent data analyses conducted across gender.This weighting factor provided a final sample which was 44% male and56% female, characteristic of our own and likely many other institutions.Comparisons were also made among participants recruited and tested in5 0 Oliver, Reed, & SmithALCOHOL USE47 various ways. Despite rather large differences in methods of recruitmentand administration, no differences were found among the different groupsof participants.MeasuresCore Alcohol and Drug Survey (\"Core Survey\"): Facets of substanceuse assessed by the Core Survey (Presley et al., 1993, 1995) include thenature of substances used and abused; the amount of substances andfrequency with which they are consumed; and negative consequences ofstudents' substance use. The Core Survey was developed to provideinformation regarding specific behaviors and beliefs; data are reported byindividual question, and subscales are not available.The Core Survey is a comprehensive self-report instrument thatincludes but is not limited to a survey of five aspects of consumption of12 substances. Items pertaining to substance consumption and con-sequences of consumption have responses in a Likert format with varyingnumbers of levels depending on the type of item. Correlations betweenitems pertaining to alcohol use and items pertaining to consequences ofalcohol consumption ranging from .08 to .65 and test-retest correlationsover an unspecified time interval ranging from .59 to 1.00 have beenreported.Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI): The BAI (Beck, Epstein, Brown, &Steer, 1988) was developed specifically to measure the severity ofanxietyandtodiscriminateanxietyfrom depressionreliablyinpsychiatric populations. The BAI is a self-report inventory that assesses21 common symptoms of anxiety using a four-point Likert scale; scoresrange from 0 to 63. It has excellent internal reliability, as measured bycoefficient alpha, and high test-retest reliability. Excellent convergentvalidity and discriminant validity have been reported in psychiatricpopulations (Beck et al., 1988; Fydrich, Dowdall, & Chambless, 1992).High internal consistency reliability and comparable factor structureshave been demonstrated in both clinical and student samples (Borden,Peterson, & Jackson, 1991).Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): The BDI (Beck, Ward, Men-delson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961) was designed to assess severity ofaffective, cognitive, motivational, and physiological aspects of depressivesymptoms in psychiatric populations. The BDI is a 21-item self-reportmeasure whose response alternatives have a Likert format in a four-pointcontinuum; scores range from 0 to 63. The BDI has been validated foruse with a university population (Bumberry, Oliver, & McClure, 1978).Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ): The Personal-Emotional Adjustment subscale was selected from the SACQ (Baker & V..... 9t,lf 48NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Siryk, 1989) for use in this study because of its capacity to assess positiveadjustment as the potential opposite pole of dysphoria. The SACQ wasdeveloped for two purposes: to identify students experiencing adjustmentdifficulties who might benefit from remedial intervention; and to providea source of dependent variables in investigations of students' adjustmentto college as functions of personality and of environmental variables.The SACQ is a 67-item self-report measure whose responses are provided on a9-pointLikertscale.ForthePersonal-EmotionalAdjustment subscale, in 25 independent samples of freshpersons at 10institutions, the mean internal consistency reliability as measured byCronbach's alpha was .82. Regarding concurrent validity, the Personal-Emotional Adjustment subscale has been found to correlate substantiallywith other indices of positive adjustment; most particularly, it has beenfound to correlate .80 with the Mental Health Inventory (Baker & Siryk,1989).The Stress Audit: The Stress Audit (Miller, Smith, & Mehler, 1983) isa comprehensive measure of three aspects of stress: 1) external stressors;2) subjective stress; and 3) relative vulnerability to stress operationalizedprimarily as health-related behaviors and lifestyle. Five stress scales wereselectedto measure physical symptoms because they comprise acomprehensive and systematic review of symptoms that may occur ineach of five bodily systems. A sixth scale, Emotional Stress, was selectedto measure dysphoria that included anxiety and depression. Respondentsrated the amount of stress caused by each physical symptom, during thelast six months on a five-point Likert scale. In a large sample of patientsreferred to a stress management clinic, internal consistency reliabilitycoefficients for subscales ranged from .76 to .98. Cronbach's alpha forcomposite scores ranged from .87 to .93; test-retest reliability coefficientsfor intervals from one to six weeks ranged from .48 to .92, and concurrentvalidity ranged from .46 to .70 (Miller, Smith, & Mehler, 1983).Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI): The EDI (Garner, Olmstead, &Polivy, 1983) was designed to measure behaviors, attitudes, and psy-chological traits common in anorexia nervosa and bulimia. The EDI wasoriginally designed to assess two related but discriminable aspects ofeating dysfunctions, which it measures on two types of subscales:subscales pertaining to behaviors and attitudes; and subscales pertainingto personality traits that characterize people with anorexia nervosa andbulimia. Behavioral andattitudinalsubscalesconsist of Drive forThinness; Bulimia; and Body Dissatisfaction. Scores on Drive forThinness, Bulimia, and Body Dissatisfaction were combined into a singlecomposite score (\"Eating Awareness; and Fear of Maturity. Scores on Ineffectiveness, Per-fectionism, Interpersonal Distrust, Interoceptive Awareness, and Fear ofMaturity were combined into a single composite score of personalitytraits associated with eating problems (\"Eating Traits\").The EDI is a 64-item self-report measure on which responses areindicated on a six-point Likert scale. Internal consistency reliability ofsubscales as measured by Cronbach's alpha > .80 and convergent validityranging from .43 to .68 ( p <.001) have been reported (Garner, Olm-stead, & Polivy, 1983). In non-clinical populations in general and incollege populations in particular, it has been found to have high internalconsistency and to be a multidimensional instrument with a relativelystable factor structure (Crowther, Lilly, Crawford, & Shepherd, 1992;Klemchuk, Hutchinson, & Frank, 1990; Raciti & Norcross, 1987).Cooperative Institutional Research Program's Student The CIRP was used to on the CIRP includedgender; age; class standing; parental income; and residence. Religiousaffiliation was surveyed in a question designed specifically for thispopulation.ProcedureMeasures and their respective instructions were combined into asingle questionnaire. Participants recorded their responses on an answersheet that could be scanned optically. Participants were asked whetherthey would be willing to participate in a follow-up study. Those whodeclined to participate in follow-up were promised complete anonymity;those who agreed to participate in follow-up were promised completeconfidentiality.RESULTSTable 2lists means and standard deviations on measures ofpsychological problems by gender, together with results of tests of thesignificance of differences between genders, and for the sample as awhole.In order to ascertain the relation between alcohol consumption andconsequences of alcohol use, we factor analyzed participants' responsesto all measures. We selected principal components analysis with Obliminrotation because thereis no previous evidence about the possiblestructure of psychological problems or possible relations between alcoholconsumption,consequencesof alcoholconsumption,internalizingproblems, and eating problems. Factor analysis was conducted within and 50NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY across genders because of the possibility that psychological problemsmight cohere in different patterns as a function of gender.TABLE 2 Means and Standard Deviations on Measures of Psych-ological Variables by Gender and Results of Tests ofDifferences p < .001Factors extracted within males, within females, and across genderswere very similar; we therefore report results across genders as shown inTable 3.In the total sample, two factors were extracted which togetheraccounted for two-thirds of the variance. Factor I, which accounted forabout half of the variance, was characterized by high loadings ofPersonal-Emotional Adjustment (loading negatively), the BDI, and theBAI; by high moderate loadings of Eating Traits, Emotional Stress, andPhysical Symptoms; and by a considerable loading of Eating Problems.Factor I appeared to be characterized best as \"Internalized Distress\".Factor II, which accounted for an additional 18% of the variance, was defined by highloadings of Alcohol Consumption and AlcoholConsequences and seemed best termed \"Alcohol Use and Its Problems\".53 Oliver, Reed, & SmithALCOHOL USE51 Alcohol Use and Its Problems was only minimally correlated withInternalized Distress (r =.1O, n.s.).Alcohol consumption and con-sequences of alcohol use thus cohered together into a single integratedfactor appropriately construed as Alcohol Use and Its Problems, whichwas almost completely independent of symptoms of anxiety anddepression, physical symptoms, and eating-disordered behaviors andattitudes. Eating Problems were not definitively represented by the factorsextracted.TABLE 3 Factor Loadings of Psychological Problems on FactorsExtracted from Indices by Gender and for Alcohol Use and Its Problems (as well as onInternalized Distress) by gender, together with results of the test ofsignificance of the difference between the genders, and for the totalsample are displayed in Table 2. Males scored significantly higher thandid females on Alcohol Use and Its Problems.We next examined alcohol use in its dual aspects of consumption andconsequences at a finer level of analysis. To permit this level of analysis,we decomposed the composite index of consumption into the four itemsthat contributed to the consumption index and decomposed the compositet'5 7 52NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY index of consequences into the19 itemsthat contributed totheconsequences index. DSM-IV's criteria for Alcohol Abuse embed\"recurrent\" or \"continued use\" of alcohol despite the occurrence ofnegative consequences in each of the four positive or \"rule-in\" criteria.This precedent provided a rationale for including the four indices offrequency and amount of alcohol consumption in the analysis with the 19consequences of consumption.TABLE 4 Factor Loadings of Indices of Alcohol Consumption andConsequences on Factors Extracted From Total SampleIndex of Alcohol Use Fact. 1Fact. 2Fact. 3Fact. 4Fact. 5Fact. in Past .94Episodes of Binge Drinking/ Past .7930 DaysNo. of Drinks/ Past -.65Had Hangover .55Got Nauseated/ Vomited -.32Drove While Intoxicated .57Had Memory Loss -.42-.34Seriously Thought of Suicide -.72Serious Tried to Commit Suicide .79-.33Was Hurt or Police/Authority .39Damaged DWI/DUI or Fight -.80Was Criticized by Someone -.74Was Taken Advantage of -.82SexuallyTook Advantage of Another .84SexuallyThought Might Have Drinking -.72 ProblemDid Something Regretted Later -.62Tried Unsuccessfully to Stop -.89Eigenvalue 7.602.422.141.361.261.09 % of Variance Accounted For 33.1010.549.305.905.504.80We simplified and organized data from the 23 discrete indicators ofalcohol use by means of factor analysis. We again selected principlecomponents analysis with Oblimin rotation as an exploratory, non-hypothesis-testing method of factor analysis that could be compared withresults obtained by grouping consequences according to the scheme usedin DSM-IV. Results of the factor analysis are displayed in Table 4.As shown in Table 4, six factors emerged from the analysis. Takentogether, the six factors accounted for nearly 70% of the variance.Oblique rotation failed to produce simple structure; only the first twofactors were defined b3E,.itsms with positive loadings. However, the Oliver, Reed, & SmithALCOHOL USE53 factors were psychologically meaningful, so results of oblique rotationwere preferred to those of a Varimax rotation.Factor I was clearly the strongest factor, accounting for one-third ofthe variance. Factor I was defined by the four indices of frequency andamount of consumption, all of which loaded very highly on the factor. Inaddition,the(short-term,physiological) consequence of having ahangover loaded moderately highly on Factor I, as did another short-termbut potentially very serious consequence of driving while intoxicated.Factor I therefore seemed to be described appropriately as \"heavydrinking\"; it is debatable whether Factor I can appropriately be construedas \"heavy drinking without major problems\" because driving whileintoxicated is a high-risk behavior. Factors II and III were only aboutone-third as strong as Factor I, each accounting for about an additional10% of the variance.Factor II was characterized by high loadings ofbeing arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and by making aserious suicidal attempt and by moderate loadings of getting in troublewith the police or with campus authorities. Factor II might best becaptured by the phrase, \"High-Risk Behaviors\". Factors III though VIwere all characterized by negative loadings. Factor III was defined byvery high loadings of having performed badly on a test or other importantproject due to alcohol use and of arguing or fighting due to use; by highmoderate loadings of having been criticized by others for one's behaviorwhile under the influence and having missed a class due to alcohol use;and by moderate loadings of regretting one's behavior and having beenhurt or injured due to alcohol use. Factor III appeared to representimpairment in academic and social roles due to externalizing behaviors,some of them active, such as getting into arguments and fights, some ofthem passive, such as performing poorly or missing classes. Factor IIIseemed to be appropriately construed as \"General Role Impairment\".Factors IV, V, and VI were likewise equal in strength, each accountingfor about half as much variance as either Factor II or Factor III, or about5% of the variance. Factor IV, which was also characterized by negativeloadings, was defined by high loadings of having been taken advantage ofsexually and suicidal ideation due to alcohol use and by a moderateloading of memory loss. Factor IV therefore seemed clearly to represent\"Sexual Victimization Due to Alcohol\". Factor V was defined by highloadings of having taken advantage of another sexually and damagingproperty, and by a moderate loading of experiencing injury due to alcoholuse.Factor V appeared to be the mirror image of Factor IV and to becaptured by the term \"Aggression Due to Alcohol\". Factor VI wasdefined by high loadings of having tried unsuccessfully to stop using 54NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY alcohol and thinking that one might have an alcohol problem. Factor VIseemed therefore to represent \"Failing at Quitting.\"TABLE 5 Summary of Stepwise Multiple Regression Analyses forVariables Predicting Alcohol Abuse Across and WithinGendersVariable SE BBetaTotal Sample (N = 288)Catholic = 172)Catholic Religion5.3491.872.214** ..<000000.1<0200*.100 Notes: for Total Sample, R2 = .09 for Step 1; change in R2 = .03 for Step 2;change in R2 = .02 for Step 3.For Males, R2 = .16. For Females, R = .05.* p < .05** p < .01**** p < .0001We sought correlates of Alcohol Use and Its Problems as a dimensionof psychological problems because we wanted to learn whether Catholicreligious affiliation might help to identify students at risk. We selectedfour other demographic variables as ones that would compete withCatholic religious affiliation to help reveal the strength of religiousaffiliation as a. predictor. We selected gender because virtually allprevious research has found male gender to be associated with greaterconsumption and more serious consequences of use in undergraduates(Engs et al., 1996); ethnicity, because African-American ethnicity hasbeen found to be associated with less alcohol use in college students(Presley et al., 1993, 1995); residence, because on-campus residence hasbeen associated with higher rates of alcohol use; and parental incomebecause, in our sample, zero-order bivariate correlations showed that itwas significantly related to Alcohol Use and Its Problems.In order to make religious affiliation and ethnicity, the two non-ordinal variables with more than two levels, appropriate for use in Oliver, Reed, & SmithALCOHOL USE55 multiple regression analyses, we dummy-coded them, folding into an\"other\" category those categories with very few participants. Morespecifically, we dummy-coded religious affiliation into three levels:Catholic, Protestant, and other. Ethnicity was dummy-coded into intowhite, African-American, Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and other.We calculated participants' factor scale scores on Alcohol Use andAlcohol Consequences and summed participants' scores across bothmeasures.Multiple regression analyses were then conducted across and withingenders using Alcohol Use and Its Problems as the criterion and the set ofdemographic variables as predictors. Results of multiple regressionanalysis are shown in Table 5. Alcohol Use and Its Problems wassignificantly predicted by Catholic religion, which predicted about 10%of the variance; gender, which predicted an additional 3% of the variance,and on-campus residence, which predicted an additional 2% of thevariance. These three variables taken together explained about 15% ofthe variance in Alcohol Use and Its Problems in the total sample.Alcohol Use and Its Problems was significantly predicted by a solepredictor, Catholic religious affiliation, within both males and females.In males, Catholic religious affiliation accounted for about 16% of thevariance; in females, about 5% of the variance.We also sought to establish correlates of the six factors of alcohol useby means of multiple regression. We used as predictors the samevariables used to predict the composite dimension of Alcohol Use and ItsProblems as described above, using each of the six factors of alcohol useas criteria in turn. Results of these multiple regression analyses wereremarkably similar to those obtained in seeking correlates of the factorAlcohol Use and Its Problems; religious affiliation and gender repeatedlyemerged as predictors.DISCUSSIONIn this sample of undergraduate students, Alcohol Use and ItsProblems emerged as a single coherent pattern of psychological andbehavioral problems, which was statistically independent of internalizeddistress.Levels of Alcohol Use and Its Problems were higher in malesthan in females.Items contributing to Alcohol Use and Its Problems could bedecomposed into six psychologically meaningful patterns of drinking. Ofthese, the first and strongest was \"heavy drinking\", consisting of heavyconsumption complicated by short-term problems such as having ahangover and driving while intoxicated. It is debatable whether this factorcan be considered as relatively uncomplicated heavy drinking, given thatdriving while intoxicated can have potentially extreme consequences. 56NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The next four factors extracted were all associated with problemsattributable to alcohol use, problems that included high-risk behaviors,general role impairment, sexual victimization due to alcohol con-sumption, and aggression due to alcohol consumption.The final factor extracted from items contributing to Drinking and ItsProblems consisted of inability to stop drinking. The presence of thisfactor suggests that alcohol use may be difficult to stop for someundergraduates and may progress to alcohol dependence.Among demographic risk factors for alcohol abuse, the strongest inour sample at a Jesuit institution was Catholic religious affiliation.Catholic religious affiliation exceeded male gender, a previously wellestablished demographic predictor of alcohol consumption and problemsassociated with alcohol use, as a predictor of Alcohol Use and ItsConsequences. On-campus residence also significantly predicted AlcoholUse and Its Consequences.The present data fail to provide support for either the hypothesis thatthose who drink heavily are doing so to self-medicate for problems suchas anxiety and depression, or the observation that drinking continued overa sufficient period of time results in subjective distress, particularlyanxiety and depression.The emergence of Catholic religious affiliation as a significantpredictor of Alcohol Use and Its Problems joins three other reports ofCatholic religious affiliation as a risk factor for alcohol consumption andfor problems associated with alcohol use (Engs et al., 1996; Hanson,1974; Wernig, 1989). These four investigations have now examined therelation between Catholic religious affiliation and alcohol use in studentsenrolled at various types of institutions, both non-sectarian and sectarian;compared consumption rates in students enrolled at Jesuit and non-Jesuitinstitutions; and ascertained levels of alcohol use and consequences ofalcohol use among students of varying religious affiliations enrolled at asingle Jesuit institution.All three types of study have found Catholicreligious affiliation to be a significant correlate of alcohol consumptionand/or problems related to alcohol use. It might be noted as well thatCatholic religious affiliation predicted alcohol abuse within both men andwomen and predicted specific patterns of Alcohol Use and Its Problemsranging from heavy drinking through failing at quitting.No study has yet separated Catholic religious affiliation from eth-nicity, which is frequently correlated with Catholic religious affiliation.A study currently underway within the same Jesuit institution willseparate Catholic religious affiliation from ethnicity. Likewise, noinvestigation has so far been reported which tests the strength of theinteraction between Catholic religious affiliation and gender as a Oliver, Reed, & SmithALCOHOL USE57 predictor of alcohol consumption and/or problems associated withalcohol use. Certainly the differential magnitude of the associationbetween Catholic religious affiliation and Alcohol Use, and Its Problemsfound within gender in our sample, suggests that the interaction betweenreligious affiliation and gender islikely to be significant inthispopulation.This study isthe firstto our knowledge to apply multivariatetechniques to responses to the very carefully designed Core Survey. It islikewise the first to our knowledge to examine alcohol consumption andconsequences of alcohol use in the context of other psychologicalproblems common in undergraduate students. Finally, it is the first to ourknowledge to relate religious affiliation to alcohol consumption andconsequences of use as assessed by the Core Survey.Limitations of this study include the reliance on self-report measuresof alcohol consumption and consequences of alcohol use and therelatively small sample of males. Although the self-report measure ofalcohol use selected for this investigation has been used extensively andwas carefully selected, further investigations of alcohol use in un-dergraduates might make use of collateral informants such as roommatesand friends. We compensated statistically for the relatively small numberof males who participated in this study, but it would be desirable toobtain a larger absolute number of male participants.Findings from this investigation imply that because of the virtuallycomplete independence of internalized distress and Alcohol Abuse andIts Problems, students who are drinking to excess and/or experiencingproblems related to drinking are unlikely to be motivated to presentthemselves for treatment, whether at a counseling center sponsored by theinstitution or elsewhere. Rather, patterns of alcohol use and alcohol-related problems identified in this investigation suggest that students whoare consuming alcohol heavily are likely to have academic, social,disciplinary, and legal problems, problems that will come to the attentionof faculty, resident advisors, and administrators. Although residentadvisors and administrators may already be aware of associationsbetween these problems and heavy alcohol consumption, faculty may beless aware of them. It may be helpful to educate faculty about suchconnections, about ways of addressing such issues with students whohave problems, and about appropriate referrals when the statisticalassociation between academic problems and maladaptive alcohol useseems likely to apply in the case of a particular student. Additionally,because of the growing evidence that Catholic religious affiliationpredicts alcohol consumption and problems associated with alcohol use ata variety of different types of educational institutions, it may be both63 58NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY feasible and necessary to develop psycho-educational programs regardingrisks of drinking behavior targeted specifically for Catholic students.REFERENCESAbbey, A.(1991).

Psychology and Religion: Indicators ofIntegrationAmber HaqueInternational Islamic University MalaysiaAlthoughpsychologyandreligionhaveexperiencedanuneasyrelationship in the past, there is now a reversal of that trend seen from anincreasing positive relationship between the two disciplines. In thispaper, reasons for resurgence of psychology--religion dialogue arediscussed in brief and a variety of indicators showing integration areexamined. A list of relevant Web Pages and e-mail discussion groups isalso presented. Given the findings, it is concluded that the psychology-religion relationship will become stronger in the future and is perhapsgearing towards becoming an independent social scientific discipline initself.Despite attempts to integrate psychology and religion between the 19thCentury and the mid 20th Century (Shafranske, 1996; Wulff, 1997), thetwo have been generally seen as mutually exclusive and the relationshipbetween them viewed as one of paradox and impossibility. Based on ananalysis of 50 psychological textbooks in the 1940s, Allport (1948)reported that in most psychological texts, \"there is nothing to reportexcept that they contain no treatment of the religious sentiment or closelyrelated mental functions\" (p.83). Several researches have also shownpsychologist's antipathy toward religion to the extent that it became ataboo topic within psychology (Campbell, 1971; Kirkpatrick and Stone,1935; Leuba, 1934). However, there now seems to be a reversal of thesituation (Grace and Poelstra, 1995; Hefner, 1997; Miller and Martin,1988; Shafranske, 1996; Watts and Williams, 1988) and a the rise (Caplan,1995; Haque, 1999;Loewenthal, 2000; Neelman and Persaud, 1995). There is even publicinterest in integrating the fields of psychology and religion (Peck, 1978;1983). What is contributing to the resurgence of psychology--religiondialogue and what are the objective indicators of their integration? Thispaper briefly examines the possible reasons for resurgence and reviewsthe indicators of integration evident through an increase in professionalorganizations, university and institutional programs, academic journals,books and magazines, and even a fast developing Internet resource.Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Amber Haque, ofPsychology, International Islamic U., Jalan Gombak, 53100 Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 61-76.NAJP'67 62NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY REASONS FOR RESURGENCEThere are situational as well as theoretical reasons contributing to theupsurge of the psychology--religion dialogue. Survey research indicatesover 90% of the population in North America identifies itself with areligion and that religious beliefs have continuously grown since theAmerican Revolution (Gallup and Jones, 1989; Shafranske, 1996). Anincrease of religious interest among the people would obviously leadpsychologists to study religious phenomena whether or not psychologistsprofess to be religious themselves. Second, there is a great amount ofresearch underway in the area of religion and mental health. Manypsychologists now argue that religion is a potential positive factor instabilizing the person's life (Bhugra, 1996; 1987; Zainand Varma, 1996). Third, the media also has portrayed religion as acontroversial factor in the present day world, leading human scienceresearchers to examine the influence of religion on human behavior (seefor example, Pipes, 1990; Shaheen, 1999). Conflicts in the Middle East,Europe, and some other Asian countries in the name of religion attest tothis fact. Fourth, perhaps the growth of a diversified psychology amidst aweakening influence of behaviorism on the American psychologicalscene has also given rise to alternative views of looking at humanbehavior. Fifth, a tremendous increase in the multicultural population inthe North America with varying sets of belief systems has obligatedhelping professionals to consider a client's cultural and religious valuesin the evaluation and treatment process. This factor is tied to the growthofthescientist-practitionermodelemphasizingpractice-orientedapproach where religion cannot be ignored as a personality variable.There is a related concern over the increased number of professionalswho deal with \"human\" issues using a strictly \"scientific\" approach(Newman, 1989). Sixth, an impressive growth in the scientific inquiry ofreligion as a variable in human behavior has triggered further research inthe field. Seventh, a more sophisticated yet less distinct psychology ofreligionin Europe and Asian countries where the tiltistowardphenomenological and transpersonal psychologies presents a challengefor similar development in North America (Wulff, 1997).Within the theoretical reasons, first, there are psychologists who havechallenged the limited domain of psychological research and argue thatthe metaphysical concepts, including soul, consciousness, transpersonalexperience, and spirituality be studied in depth (Al 1996). Second, besidesthe views of the personality theorists, certain theoretical propositions of68 HaguePSYCHOLOGY & RELIGION 63 more recent origin regarding the influence of religion on humans are alsoresponsible for this trend. For examples, consider the attributional theoryof Spilka,Shaver and Kirkpatrick(1985);attachment theoryofKirkpatrick (1995) andtheright-wingauthoritarianismtheoryofAltemeyer and Hunsberger (1992). Third, a scientific undertaking ofpsychology and religion as a discipline needs a conceptual framework.The emphasis on measurement alone cannot fill the void of an adequatetheory (Hood, Spilka, Hunsberger, and Gorsuch, 1996, p.23). Fourth, thepost-modernism movement has also served as an impetus in reassessingpsychology's evaluation of religion. Post-modernistic views emphasizethat theories are merely constructs and theoretical truths are relative topersonal and cultural contexts. Philosopher Paul Roth (1987) advisessocial scientists to consider a pluralistic view of human inquiry in whichmultiple methods can exist. Paloutzian (1996) elaborates this pointfurther in explaining recent developments in the philosophy of scienceand psychological research methodology.INDICATORS OF INTEGRATIONProfessional OrganizationsThe earliest professional organizations that were established toemphasize integratedresearchinclude The American Society forPsychical Research (established 1885) and the Association for ClinicalPastoral Education (1925). Psychology and religion research in the mid20th Century has resulted in the formation of the following organizations:American Catholic Psychological Association (1947)American Foundation of Religion and Psychiatry (1958)American Nouthetic Psychological AssociationAssociation for the Advancement of Psychosynthesis psychological movement toward self-realization.Association for Holotropic Breathwork InternationalAssociation for Religion and Intellectual LifeAssociation for the Scientific Study of ConsciousnessAssociation for Transpersonal Psychology (1972)Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology (1975)Christian Association for Psychological Studies (1953)Forum on Religion, Spirituality and Aging (1990)Hartford Institute for Religion ResearchAssociation for Humanistic Psychology (1962)International Transcendental AssociationInternational Enneagram Association teachings as a psycho-spiritual tool forpersonal development)International Federation for the Psychology of Religion, with its 64NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY secretariat in BelgiumInternational Muslim Psychological Association (1997)--based inMalaysiaPsychological Studies Institute (1971)Religious Research AssociationThe National Academy of Religion and Mental Health (1954)Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (1949)Sufi Psychological Association (1996--transcends cultural boundariesand emphasizes the importance of soul and spiritIn 1976, a professional group called Psychologists Interested in Re-ligious Issues (PIRI) achieved a division status with the AmericanPsychological Association (APA) and later changed its name to the\"Psychology of Religion,\" in 1993. According to this division, thepsychology of religion \"promotes the application of psychological re-search methods and interpretive frameworks to diverse forms of religionand spirituality; encourages the incorporation of the results of such workinto clinical and other applied settings; and fosters constructive dialogueand interchange between psychological study and practice on the onehand and between religious perspectives and institutions on the other.\"This APA Division (36) publishes its own newsletter. APA even added\"spirituality\" to the index terms listed in the PsycLit computer databaseand currently has over 1000 items of readings on spirituality itself.The APA now encourages its members to view religion as asignificant aspect of human life. The 1992 APA Code of Conduct alsospecifies that in the absence of such a service from the psychologist,appropriate referrals for the clients should be made to ensure proper andcomplete treatment of the patients. Considering the importance ofreligion, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual published by the AmericanPsychiatric Association, included in its 4th edition (1994) a classificationon \"religious problems\" which further indicates a growing recognitionamong the scientific community of religion as a factor in mental health.Integrated ProgramsIn the West, the first integrated and APA accredited doctoral programin psychology was offered at the Fuller Theological Seminary in 1988.Biola University (Rosemead Graduate School of Psychology) opened itsdoors for students in 1970. Emory University offers a Ph.D. in Religionand Personality, and Columbia University offers a joint master's degreein Religion and Social work. Doctoral programs are also offered atBaylor University(Texas), George Fox University (Oregon), andWheaton College (Illinois). The University of Tennessee at Martin alsooffersanintegrated programintheDepartment of Psychology, HaguePSYCHOLOGY & RELIGION 65 Philosophy, and Religious Studies. There are even online psychology andreligion courses offered as part of the Bachelor's of Theology Program atCanyon College (Idaho). The University of Wales at Bangor (UK) offersadvanced psychology of religion courses at its Center for MinisterialStudies. Integrated graduate programs are also offered at the John F.Kennedy Graduate School for Holistic Studies, Greenwich University(Hawaii), Naropa University (Colorado), and Trinity Western University(Canada).Apart from the traditional religious programs, transpersonal psy-chology is offered in more than 130 institutions that include fullyaccredited and non-accredited programs (Vande Kemp, 1996, p. 81). ThePsychology Department of the State University of West Georgiapublishes a Directory of Graduate Programs in Humanistic-TranspersonalPsychologyinNorthAmericaandisavailableonlineathttp://www.sonoma.edu/projects/os2/grad/os2gradschool.htm. Other reli-gion relatedintegrationincludesthe Consciousness Research andTraining Project, Psychosynthesis Project, and Spiritual Direction andFormation, alllisted in the Common Boundary Graduate EducationGuide (Demetrios, Simpkinson, and Bennet, 1991). The Haden Institutein Charlotte (North Carolina) offers courses dealing with psychology andreligion and the ISIS Institute in El Sobrante (California) focuses onTranspersonalPsychology. The Woodfish InstitutebasedinSanFrancisco (California), advocates integration of ancient healing methodsand modern psychology based on the practices of Eco-psychology andShamanism (the oldest form of mind-body healing method practicedthrough altered states of consciousness). In the 1970's, a new researcharea called \"Quality of Life,\" which encompasses psychology andreligion, also 1978; Paloutzian and Ellison, 1983).Paloutzian (1996) suggests that a more discreet way to judge whetherreligion is getting the deserved status within psychology is to see ifreligion is taught within the Introduction to Psychology course, as theauthors would include most important topics in their field at the time oftheir writing. In their research, Lehr and Spilka (1989) found that therewas substantial progress in the 1980's compared to the 1970's in usingreligious contents in introductory textbooks of psychology. An earlierstudy by Spilka, Comp, and Goldsmith (1981) also compared referencesto religion in introductory textbooks of psychology between 1950s and1970s. Although slightlyless percentage of citations in the 1970scompared to the 1950s were found, the report indicated that beginning inthe 1970s, religion was covered in a more \"objective\" manner andempirical research started to increase. 66NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY In a comparison of the editions of Psychology and Life, the oldesttextbook in general psychology, Paloutzian (1996, p.51) reported anupsurge of religious content in the 9th and 10th editions (1937-1979), butthe sections on religious content were missing in the 11th through the 13theditions. Loewenthal (2000) pointed out that in the first half of the 1990sthere was a 400% increase in mean references to religion per book inundergraduate social psychology and psychology of personality textbooks(p. 10). Also the annual number of publications in religion and mentalhealth went up by 400%-500% in the 1990s compared to the 1980s (Deinand Loewenthal, 1998).A review of the existing literature suggests that Christian graduatetrainingprograms and professional societiesinpsychology havedeveloped more rapidly compared to integrated training programs forother religions of the world. The reason for more integrated programs inChristian countries may be attributed to the availability of funds, hardwork, and organized efforts, as well as greater marketability of thoseprograms. Another reason for the growth of such programs could be theabsorption of graduates into Christian counseling centers, hospitals andother religiously oriented human service agencies. Yet another reason forapparent rapid growth of integrated programs in the West and largelyChristian world is a lack of research available from other communitiesand the Eastern world.Several places that offer integrated postgraduate programs in the Eastare Brokenshire College in Davo City, Philippines, where programs in thearea of psychology and religion are based on the Christian faith;International Islamic University of Malaysia, where integrated programswere established inthe mid 1990s initsvarious human sciencesdisciplines including psychology, and The International Institute ofIslamic Thought and Civilization, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, developedsimilar programs in the early 1990s. Other programs available in Asia aremostly in local languages and are not publicized well. The integration ofreligion and psychology has also taken place in Jewish (Meier, 1988),other Muslim (Rizvi, 1988), and Buddhist (De Silva, 1996) communities,but their numbers are very few (Tan, 1996).Academic JournalsTwo journals that integrated psychology and religion were establishedat the beginning of the 20th century, i.e. The American Journal ofPsychology and Education (1904) and the Journal of American Societyfor Psychical Research (1907). A majority of the integrated psychologyjournals emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century, especially inthe 1980s and 1990s, for example, The Journal of Psychology and72 HaquePSYCHOLOGY & RELIGION 67 Theology establishedin1973,The Journalof Psychology andChristianity establishedin1982, The Journal of Psychology andJudaism, and The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion,established in 1990. The International Journal for the Psychology ofReligion is a platform for international psychologists interested in thisarea and presents a wide array of articles, essays and reviews fromAustralia (O'Connor, 1996; 1998), Brazil (Carvalho and Sato, 1997),Canada (Hunsberger, Alisat, Pancer, and Pratt, 1996; Ross, England (Argyle 1996), Iceland(HaroldssonandHoutkooper,1996),Italy(Aletti,1992),TheNetherlands 1993), Granqvistand Hagekull, 2000), and Turkey (Kose, 1996).Other integrated journals include, Journal of Religion and Healthestablished in 1961, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion (1961),The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology (1968), Journal of HumanisticPsychology, Review of Religious Research (1969), Journal of ReligiousGerontology (1989), Research in the Social Scientific Study of Religion,Pastoral Psychology, The International Journal of Transpersonal Studies(1993--previously known as The Australian Journal of TranspersonalPsychology established in 1981), The Mind's Eye Journal (1996), and theSufi Psychology Association Journal (1996).The Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness publishestwo official journals, i.e. 1) Consciousness & Cognition (1994) and 2)Psyche (1994). Cross Current is another psychological journal focusingon integration of the soul and the mind. The Association of MuslimSocial Scientists in the USA started an integrated journal called theAmerican Journal of Islamic Social Sciences (AJISS), in 1973. AJISSpublished a special \"Psychology Issue\" in 1998, where several areas ofgeneral psychology were addressed from an Islamic religious perspective.The Intellectual Discourse (1992) published from the InternationalIslamic University of Malaysia is another journal of integrated nature aswell as the Journal of Islamic Studies published from UK and HamdardIslamicus (1982) published from Pakistan.Books and MagazinesA few books that appeared at the start of the 20th Century are EdwardAmes' Psychology of Religious Experience (1910), George Stratton'sPsychology of Religious Life (1911) followed by James Pratt's TheReligious Consciousness (1920). A few more books appeared in Europe, 68NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY e.g. An Introduction to the Psychology of Religion by Robert Thouless(1923) and the Psychology of Religious Mysticism, by James Leuba(1925). Then again, numerous books started to appear on the subject inthe 1980s and 1990s. Authors of these works include Batson and Ventis,1982; Belzen, special edition of The Journal of Psychology and Theology (Grace andPoelstra, 1995) deserves mention here as well, as it relates to exploringthe integration of psychology and religion in undergraduate psychologycourses. Most of these books are written by Christian psychologists andpublished in the West.Books written on psychology and religion from Asian perspectivesare also available, and the number is growing (for details, see Kao &Sinha, 1997; Kuppuswamy, 1993; Singh, 1979; Wallace, Orme-Johnson,and Dillbeck, 1993). Some references integrating Islam and Psychologyare also available in a book by Yasien Mohamad (1998) and in an earliertreatise on A History of Muslim Philosophy by M.M. Sharif (1963). ZafarA. Ansari (1992) also compiled papers on integrating psychology andreligion presented in an Islamic conference held in Islamabad, Pakistan.Many books are available on the general subject of psychology andreligion but in local languages; for example, a significant amount ofresearch has been conducted in Arabic-speaking countries, but theEnglish translation of such works is not currently available (Hague,1999).Monographs, chapters, and articles on psychology and religion havealso appeared in many places, i.e., The Annual Review of Psychology(Gorsuch, 1988), American Psychologist (Bergin, 1991; Jones, 1994;Weiner, Lykken, and Tellegen, well that relate to the psychology--religioninterface, e.g. Alphaomega, published from Sweden, addresses psy-chology and spirituality issues.

Substantial growthstarted to take place in the 1970s and significant increase started in the1980s and 1990s. This change, although more apparent in NorthAmerica, is also noted in other countries through indicators such asburgeoning professional organizations and institutes, university programs,academic journals, books and magazines, and the growing number ofInternet sites. This review is by no means inclusive, and further researchin collaboration with psychologists from other parts of the world wouldbe highly beneficial in measuring the international growth and trends ofthe psychology--religion interface. The present review suggests that the7 6 HaguePSYCHOLOGY & RELIGION 71 integration of psychology and religion as a discipline is well on its waytoward becoming an independent area of social science research.REFERENCESAl Attas, S.M.N.

Descriptions of Religious Experience among U.S.Christians and Malaysian MuslimsMichael E. NielsenGeorgia Southern UniversityRick StevensUniversity of Louisiana at MonroeCross-cultural descriptions of religious experiences were investigated intwo studies using adjectives derived from the five-factor model ofpersonality. In study 1, 93 U.S. Christians indicated that adjectivesreflecting low levels of neuroticism, and high levels of agreeableness andconscientiousness reflected how they felt during religious experiences.Adjectives reflecting positive affect also were rated to be descriptive ofreligious experiences. Study 1 also found that participants do not havereligious experiences as frequently as they would like. In study 2, 62Malaysian Muslims were asked to describe either their most importantreligious or spiritual experience. These descriptions followed a similarpattern as was found in Study 1, with participants describing themselvesas being more emotionally stable, open and extraverted during religiousthan during spiritual experiences. Results are discussed in terms of the utility of adjective ratings for describing experiences across diverse religious traditions.A fascinating area in psychological studies of religion concerns people's descriptions of religious experiences. In studies of religious experience, as in studies of many psychological phenomena, researchers rely on self-reports because the phenomenon cannot be independentlyand objectively confirmed. Researchers therefore must determine themethod most suitable for obtaining self-reports. Most often, the methodhas been to devise a scale of statements based on the writings of religious figures or mystics for describing the experiences (e.g., Hood, 1975; Spilka, Brown & Cassidy, 1992).Such an approach has the advantage of strong face validity. Themystic or religious leader, who ostensibly is quite familiar with the phenomena, may be better suited than most people to articulate thecharacteristics of an experience characterized by its very ineffability. At the same time, the approach may possess certain disadvantages. The applicability of these descriptions to the average person's religiousAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Michael Nielsen, Department ofPsychology, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA 30460-8041, email mnielsen@gasou.edu.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001,'Vol. 3, No. 1, 77-90.NAJP83 78NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY experience may be questioned. Religious leaders and mystics differ fromtheir followers and non-mystics in many ways, and the experiences thateach group has are conceivably quite different in nature, intensity, and/orfrequency. For example, although 84% of people in the U.S. state thatreligion is important (Gallup & Jones, 1989), research also indicatesrelatively low rates of mystical experience by people, and that simplesurveys may actually overestimate the rate at which mystical experiencesoccur (Thomas & Cooper, 1978, 1980). An additional disadvantage is theextent to which such scales may be limited to a single religious tradition.As an examination of Hill and Hood's (1999) compendium of scalesreveals, the majority of scales include content specific to one religion,usually Christianity. The culture-bound content of scales reduces theirutility across religious or spiritual traditions.Several alternatives exist to studying religious or mystical experiencevia surveys. One is to examine experiences in terms that are morebroadly applied to the description of people or events in general. Such anapproach will inform us of broad ways that religious experiences mightbe characterized, and perhaps distinguish religious experiences fromother kinds of experiences. This is the approach taken in the presentstudies, which explore how general adjectives might be used to describereligious experiences. The logic underlying this lexical approach is basedon Allport and Odbert's (1936) classic study, which assumed that theterms found in everyday language are assumed to be useful in describingpeople and their experiences. Research in this vein has focused onpersonality, and, to a lesser extent, affect.Many lexical studies of personality have revealed five factors ordimensions: neuroticism (emotional stability), extraversion, openness,agreeableness, and conscientiousness (McCrae & Costa, 1985, 1987).McCrae and Costa's (1985, 1987) work on the five factor model isinteresting in that it demonstrated substantial correlations between simpleadjective pairs intended to measure the five factors (the lexical tradition)and more elaborate scales developed for that purpose. Their research,involving more than 1,000 participants, also demonstrated a highcorrelation between self- and other-ratings on the five factors. Thissuggests that people's perceptions of themselves are consistent withothers' perceptions. To the extent that self-ratings may be valid, then, theuse of adjectives represents one alternative to researchers seeking tounderstand how people view religious experiences.Researchers have begun to investigate the connections betweenreligious experience and the five-factor model of personality. MacDonald(2000)investigatedseveraldimensionsof spirituality,andtheircorrelation with the five-factor model of personality. Spirituality wasassessed in five dimensions: cognitive, experiential, existential well-84 Nielsen & StevensCHRISTIAN-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS 79 being, paranormal beliefs, and religiousness. Analyses revealed thatneuroticism correlatednegativelywithexistentialwell-being.Ex-traversion correlated positively with all spirituality correlated positively with cognitive, existential well-being,and religiousness. A second recent study using this approach askedparticipants to use adjectives representing the five-factor model ofpersonality to describe how participants felt during religious experiences(Nielsen, 2000). Similar to the results found by MacDonald (2000),people described their feelings during religious experiences as being highin agreeableness and low in neuroticism.The following two brief studies seek to extend this research in severalways. In the first study, we examine the utility of affect adjectives fordescribing how participants feel during a religious experience. That studyalso assesses the extent to which participants' religious experiencesmatch ideal or model religious experiences. In Study 2, we consider thedescriptions of religious experiences among Malaysian Muslims, and theextent to which spiritual experiences are distinct from religious ones.STUDY 1Notable for its absence in research regarding religion is Russell's(1980, 1983) two-dimensional taxonomy of affect. The first dimension,positive vs. negative affect',is characterized by adjectives such aspleased and miserable. The second dimension, intensity, is characterizedby adjectives such as aroused and sleepy. Crossing these two dimensionsyields four combinations of arousal (bored).There would appear to be many possibilities to apply this model ofaffect to religious experience. The present study begins by examining theperceived relevance of these dimensions to religiousness. Specifically,how well do adjectives corresponding to these dimensions reflectreligious experience? Because most Americans consider religion to be\"very important\" (Gallup & Jones, 1989), and based on the assumptionthat people generally seek pleasure and avoid pain, it was hypothesizedthat adjectives containing a positive valence would be considered more descriptive of religious experience than would negatively-valencedadjectives. No prediction was made regarding the intensity dimension.2Study 1, then, represents an attempt to replicate and extend thefindings of Nielsen (2000). Participants rated words, derived frompersonality and affect taxonomies, in terms of how well each worddescribed how they felt during their religious experiences. Among the 80NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY personality adjectives, words representing low neuroticism (emotionalstability) and high agreeableness were expected to receive the highestratings. Among affect adjectives, words representing positive valencewere expected to receive higher ratings than negatively valenced words.The congruence between a word's importance in describing religiousexperiences, and how often the word actually is experienced, also wasinvestigated. In a sense, this is similar to Rogers' notion of \"Real\" vs.\"Ideal\" self-concepts (Rogers, 1976). Participants were asked to indicateboth how important an adjective is for describing religious experiences,and how often they actually experience that adjective in their religiouslives. This was done in order to explore possible discrepancies betweenhow people would like their religious experiences to be, and how theexperiences actually are.MethodParticipants. The snowball method of sampling (Henry, 1990) wasused for Study 1. Participants were 93 Illinois adults not enrolled inschool. Mean age of participants was 39 (S.D. = 13.1, range 16 to 87).3Participants tended to be female (52%), reported attending churchservices an average of 2.9 times during the previous month (S.D. = 3.7,range 0 to 25), and reported praying an average of 7.9 times during theprevious week (S.D. = 8.2, range 0 to 45). The most common de-nominational affiliations were Catholic (N = 26), Lutheran (9), Mormon(8), Presbyterian (6), and Methodist (5). Additional denominations listedby fewer than five participants included Christian, Episcopal, FederatedChristian, Jehovah's Witness, Pentecostal, Southern Baptist, Unitarian,and United Church of Christ. Four participants listed \"None\" as theirdenomination, and 20 left this item blank.Measures and Procedure. Dimensions of affect were represented byfiveadjectives,andpersonalitytraitswere represented by fouradjectives4, listed in Appendix A. Approximately one half of the par-ticipants completed the adjective ratings in alphabetical order, and theother half completed the task in reverse-alphabetical order. Participantsfirst were asked to describe an important religious experience that theyhave had. Then, in the context of that experience, participants rated howwell each adjective described their feelings during that experience, andhow important the word is for describing religious experiences.Results and DiscussionAdjectives representing each affect or personality dimension wereaveraged, yielding scores with theoretical limits of 1 (Does not-) and 7(Does describe my feelings during the religious experience). Forquestions regarding how frequently participants experience the word in`86 Nielsen & StevensCHRISTIAN-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS 81 their religious experiences, responses were anchored by Never andAlways. Separate analyses were conducted for affect and personality traitterms.Affect. A 2 (Intensity: High vs. Low) X 2 (Valence: Positive vs.Negative) X 2 (Congruency: Importance vs. Frequency) within-subjectsANOVA was conducted on participants' ratings of the affect terms.Results revealed several significant effects, including main effects forIntensity, F(1, 92) = 4.17, p < .05, MSE = 0.60, partial 0)2 = .02, andfor Valence, F(1, 92) = 212.09, p < .001 MSE = 3.66, partial 0)2 = .53.These main effects were qualified by a significant Intensity X Valenceinteraction, F(1, 92) = 37.41, p < .001, MSE = .45, partial 0)2 = .19, anda Congruency X Valence interaction, F(1, 92) = 24.83, p < .001 MSE =.59, partial w2 = .20. Finally, these effects were moderated by a sig-nificant interaction involving all three factors, F(1, 92) = 5.14, p < .05MSE = .18, partial e? = .02.In order to understand the nature of the interaction, two separate 2(Intensity) X 2 (Congruence) ANOVAs were conducted, one for positiveaffect, and one for negative affect. For positive affect, there was asignificant main effect for Congruence, F(1, 92) = 29.69, p < .001, MSE= .51, partial 0)2 = .13, with participants rating these adjectives as beinggreater in importance (M = 4.4) than they were experienced (M = 4.0). Asecond main effect also was found for Intensity, F(1, 92) = 23.11, p <.001 MSE = .70, partial 0)2 = .11. Low intensity affect (M = 4.0) wasrated as being less relevant to describing religious experiences than washigh intensity affect (M = 4.4).For negative affect, only a significant effect for Intensity was found,F(1, 92) = 9.27, p < .01 MSE = .35, partial 0.)2 = .04. Although it mightbe expected that at least one of the two-way ANOVAs would show asignificant effect, this is not necessarily true when, as occurred in thisdata set,the pattern of means are different in the two two-wayinteractions (Keppel, 1982). Adjectives reflecting high intensity negativeaffect (M = 2.2) were considered more relevant to describing religiousexperience than were low intensity negative affect adjectives (M = 2.0).Of course, these results should be interpreted in the context of a largeeffect for valence, in which positive valence was more descriptive ofreligious experience than was negative valence.Personality Adjectives. There were two main questions of interestregarding the personality adjectives. First, did the general pattern foundin Nielsen (2000) hold true in this sample? If so, do differences exist inthe ratings of how important the adjectives are, and how frequently theadjectives actually are experienced? If the pattern of results found inearlier research holds true,it would be expected that the adjectivesrepresenting low neuroticism, high agreeableness, and high con- 82NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY scientiousness would receive the highest ratings. In order to confirm thispattern of results, data first were analyzed using a 5 (Trait: Neuroticismvs. Openness vs. Extraversion vs. Agreeableness vs. Conscientiousness)X 2 (Pole: High vs. Low) repeated measures ANOVA. The Trait X Poleinteraction, F(4, 368) = 103.36, p < .001, MSE = 2.52, partial o? = .52,is quite similar to that found in Nielsen (2000). Adjectives correspondingto the low pole of neuroticism (M = 4.4), and the high poles ofagreeableness (M = 4.5) and conscientiousness (M = 3.7), received thehighest endorsement by participants.

Higher ratings reflect greater endorsement of the adjectives for describingreligious experiences. To protect against inflated family-wise error, a modifiedBonferroni procedure (Keppel, 1982) was used, yielding alpha = .02.df= (1, 92).*p < .02**p < .001 The second question of interest concerned the extent to whichparticipants indicated that they experienced each of these traits. This wastested with a set of planned comparisons. For each pole of each trait, theImportance and Frequency ratings for the adjectives were compared. Thiswas done in order to investigate possible discrepancies between theadjectives that people believe are important in describing religiousexperiences, but which are not actually achieved or felt. The meanscorresponding to these contrasts appear in Table 1, along with the resultsof the planned comparisons. Ratings of Importance and Frequency wereincongruent on the High Pole of all traits except for neuroticism. For Nielsen & StevensCHRISTIAN-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS 83 neuroticism, importance and frequency ratings are incongruent only onthe low pole.5The overall pattern described in Nielsen (2000) was replicated in thissample, with participants describing religious experiences in positiveterms. Furthermore, the positive nature of religious experiences isreinforced by the lack of congruence between the ideal and the actualexperience, as ideal experiences receive more desirable ratings than dothe actual experiences. The large effect for valence, noted earlier, isconsistent with this conclusion. Finally, participants indicated that high-intensity affect is more characteristic of religious experiences than is lowintensity affect, whether positively- or negatively-valenced.STUDY 2The research described in MacDonald (2000), Nielsen (2000), andStudy1allutilized samples made up largely of North AmericanChristians. In order to assess the generalizability of the basic findings ofthose studies, Study 2 uses a sample of Malaysian Muslims. Relativelylittle research has been conducted comparing Muslims with members ofother religions. Of that which has been done, perhaps the most commontheme is the difference between the two religions in terms of deferenceand independence. Islamic emphasis on religious expertise has beenoffered to explain high degrees of deference and order needs foundamong Muslims. This pattern has been observed, for example, incomparisons of Muslims with Hindus living in India (Ojha & Jha, 1991),and Muslims and Christians living in Nigeria (Asonibare, 1986).In a related vein, Burns and Brady (1992) found that U.S. studentsscored higher on need for uniqueness than did Malaysian students. It isconceivable that at least part of this effect is attributable to Malaysia'sadoption of an official program of Islamization, intended by officials toimprove the country (Muzzafer, 1986).Similar patterns can be found in epidemiological research, whichdemonstrates that Islamic injunctions against suicide apparently areborne out in suicide rates. Kok (1988) compared Singapore Confucian,Hindu, and Muslim women's suicide rates, and found a pattern consistentwith religious beliefs; Muslims were less likely to have committedsuicide than were Confucians, while Hindus had the highest suicide rate.Despite these differences between religious groups, research gives ussome reason to expect a degree of similarity in some religious or moralperspectives in people from different religions and cultures. Wolfe andMourribi (1985) found that Lebanese Christians and Muslims exhibitedrelatively similar patterns on the Rokeach Value Survey, with honesty,responsibility, freedom and peace rated highly by both groups. At abroader level of analysis, Moon (1986) demonstrated that the basic factor 84NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY structure and psychometric properties of the Defining Issues Test wasconsistent in 20 cross-cultural studies, although there is some evidencethat the rates of moral development may vary across cultures.Given that there appears to be several important cross-culturalsimilaritiesin general religious values held among Christians andMuslims (Richards & Bergin, 2000; Wolfe & Mourribi, 1985), weexpected to find that U.S. Christians and Malaysian Muslims woulddescribe religious experiences using essentially the same kinds of terms.That is, we expected relatively low levels of neuroticism and high levelsof agreeableness and conscientiousness to characterize religious ex-periences.A second facet of this study concerns the possible distinction betweenreligiosity and spirituality. Some students of religion recommend thatscientists focus on spirituality because it may connote less of aninstitutional affiliation than does religiosity. Alternatively, opponents ofthis view cite the long use of \"religion\" to denote many different typesof experiences, and not merely institutional ones (Pargament, 1997). Inorder to address this possible distinction, in Study 2 we asked someparticipants to describe an important religious experience, while othersdescribed an important spiritual experience. Given that other people arepart of the religious setting, we expected higher levels of extraversion tocharacterize those experiences than in the spiritual condition, which doesnot necessarily involve institutional involvement or support for theexperience.MethodParticipants were 62 Muslim students (33 female, 29 male; M age =20.5) living in Malaysia. The participants were enrolled in an English-language program after having demonstrated proficiency in English bysuccessful completion of the TOEFL. After providing demographic data(sex, age, religious affiliation) half of them were asked to \"take a fewmoments to think of the most important religious experience you haveever had,\" and then they gave a written description of that experience.The other half of the sample was asked to describe their most importantspiritual experience. Following the written description, participantsdescribed how they felt at the time of the experience by using the 80 7-point semantic differentials listed in McCrae and Costa's (1985, 1987)five-factor taxonomy of personality. One half of the semantic dif-ferentials for each trait were reversed in order to control for possibleresponse biases. Nielsen & StevensCHRISTIAN-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS 85 Results and DiscussionDescriptions of the experiences first were examined for the extent towhich they focused on institutional religious events, such as prayer orRamadan. Descriptions were rated independently by two assistants,achieving an intraclass correlation coefficient of .92, p < .05; dis-crepancies were resolved by discussion. Five participants omitted thewritten description, and were excluded from this analysis. Resultsrevealed no difference in participants' use of institutional religious eventsbetween the two religious/spiritual conditions, x2 (1, N= 57) < 1.0, n.s.Ratings of the person's feelings during the experiences were analyzednext. The semantic differential ratings of adjectives that comprise therespective traits were averaged so that a higher score corresponded to thehigh pole of that trait. Results were analyzed with a 2 (Experience:Religious vs. Spiritual) X 5 (Trait: Neuroticism vs. Extraversion vs.Opennessvs.Agreeablenessvs.Conscientiousness)mixed-modelANOVA, with trait serving as a within-subjects factor. Results showed asignificant effect for Trait, F (4, 240) = 52.30, p < .001, MSE .70,partial w2 = .45, and a significant Experience X Trait interaction, F(4,240) = 4.17, p < .01, MSE.70, partial ei = .17. Planned comparisonsrevealed significant differences in descriptions of religious and spiritualexperiences on the neuroticism, extraversion, and openness dimensions,all Fs (1, 60) > 4.29, all ps < .05, all MSEs > .27, all partial (o2s > .05.Neuroticism was rated lower in the religious (M = 3.0) than in thespiritual (M = 3.6) condition. Openness was greater in the religious (M =4.7) than in the spiritual (M = 4.4) condition. Extraversion also was ratedhigher in the religious (M = 4.8) than in the spiritual (M = 4.4) condition.Ratings of agreeableness approached significance, F (1, 60) = 3.13, p =.08, with means of 5.5 and 5.1 for the religious and spiritualconditions, respectively.Taken as a whole these results indicate a general similarity inparticipants'descriptionsinthe two studies. Following a patternconsistent with earlier research (Spilka, Ladd, McIntosh & Milmoe,1996), participants emphasized the positive elements of their religiousexperiences. Nevertheless, the participants inthisstudy describedreligious experiences more positively than they described spiritualexperiences. People described feeling less neurotic, and more extravertedand open, in the context of religious experiences than in spiritualexperiences.GENERAL DISCUSSIONA problem in the study of religious experiences isthat thoseexperiencesareineffable,defyingdescription.Forthisreason,participants in these studies were asked to use a standard set of adjectives 86NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY to describe how they felt during the experience, rather than to describethe experience itself. Adjectives reflecting high levels of emotionalstability and agreeableness were most consistently associated withreligious experience. To a lesser extent, adjectives reflecting higherlevelsof conscientiousness and extraversion also were usefulincharacterizing how participants felt during religious experiences. Asimilar pattern described spiritual experiences. Adjectives associatedwith positive affect also described participants' religious experiences.Participants' ratings in these studies indicate the positive nature ofreligious experiences in this sample. This might be expected in the U.S.sample, which by virtue of its being a snowball sample might be biasedin favor of religious experiences. The positive nature of religiousexperiences, however, also was evident in the Malaysian sample, whichconsisted of all students in two university classes. The results of thisresearch suggest that people who have had religious experiences ratethem very favorably and, as demonstrated in Study 1, they would like tohave those experiences more frequently than they actually occur.It would be desirable in future research to ascertain the distinction, ifany, that people make between \"religious\" and \"spiritual\" experiences. Inthis study, participants described religious and spiritual experiencessimilarly, although religious experiences were described in somewhatmore positive terms than were spiritual experiences. This was truedespite the fact that the descriptions of those experiences did not differ intheir inclusion of institutional events. The generalizability of this findingshould be tested, so that we can understand the extent to which thepatternis replicated in other cultures. Perhaps the Malaysian gov-ernment's official promotion of Islam may have influenced this pattern ofresults.Future research also should seek to replicate these results in samplesof other religions. In particular, research concerning religious experiencein non-monotheistic traditions is particularly lacking; this method mightbe profitably applied to such religions. Because of the difficulty ofcreating questionnaire scales that apply equally well to diverse religioustraditions, adjectives such as those used in these studies might enableresearchers to begin to compare people's experiences in spite of the vastdoctrinal differences that exist.REFERENCESAllport, G.

TurnipseedIndiana-Purdue UniversityGeorge M. KasperVirginia Commonwealth University _This paper develops an interactive model depicting the role of decisionconfidence in outcome success by integrating relevant knowledge fromdecision making, psychology, strategic management, and organizationalbehavior literatures. Analyzing the hypothesized relationships using linearstructural modeling produced results indicating that decision confidence hasa positive impact on implementation effort, and implementation effortdirectly effects outcome success. These findings elucidate the importance ofconfidence, which may be as important as quality in determining thesuccess of a plan.Research has consistently shown that explicit and relatively challenginggoals produce higher levels of performance than generalized and easy goals(e.g., Locke & Latham, 1990; Locke, Shaw, Saari, & Latham, 1981).However, goals may not produce sustainedeffort in absence of performanceknowledge or feedback (Bandura & Cervone, 1983). The literature indicatesthat goals are more likely to motivate toward higher performance whenindividuals are committed to them. Research in strategic planning suggeststhat these task-goals attributes are consistent for organizations as well asindividuals (Boal & Bryson, 1987).Dean and Sharfman (1996) provided evidence that decision makingprocesses are related to outcome success. Outcome success is a measure ofeffort, but decision quality is a measure of process. In the strategicmanagement literature, decision quality is often used synonymously withthe quality of a plan or, as stated by Koontz (1958),\"Planning isdeciding...\" (p. 48).Thus decision confidence may be equated withconfidence in a plan. -Plans are often more expansive then decisions, andinclude specified means-ends relationships as well as ends to be achieved.In either case, a good plan is high in decision quality and a poor plan is lowin decision quality.Plans influence outcomes, but good plans do notAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: David Turnipseed, Business &Mgmt. Sciences, Indiana-Purdue University, Fort Wayne, IN 46805-1499.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 91-108.NAJP.96 92NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY necessarily produce good outcomes, and poor plans do not always lead topoor results. Outcome success is only a partial measure of the quality of adecision. It is the connection between the decision making process and itsoutcome which is addressed in this study.We propose that decision confidence, or belief in the quality of adecision, is an indispensable link between planning and attaining optimalresults. Vroom and Yetton (1973) argued that when subordinates arerequired to use their initiative in implementing a decision, acceptance and,by implication, commitment to the decision is crucial. Decision confidenceis distinct from self-confidence, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, trust ina decision aid, or other types of confidence. Decision confidence affectsimplementation effort, outcome success (Russo & Schoemaker, 1992), andthe amount of implementation effort devoted to a course of action in pursuitof an outcome (Stevick, Martin, & Showalter, 1991). Confidencealso playsa key role in the selection stage of decision making, as an individualchooses among viable alternative decisions (Kasper, 1996).The role of decision confidence in outcome success \"... is critical whenit comes to implementation...\" ( McIntyre, 1982, p. 17), as confidenceprovides the drive to implement decisions. An individual's confidence in adecision influences determination and the persistence to pursue a givencourse of action (Neale & Bazerman, 1985). High confidence in a poordecision or low confidence in a good decision may both be undesirable.Confidence greater than warranted by the quality of the decision can resultin a wasteful over- commitment of resources as well as failure to recognizethe inherent situational risks and to take risk-commensurate precautions.Overconfidence can also lead to an escalation of commitment and per-sistence in implementing a decision despite clear evidence of its ultimatefailure (Staw, 1976; 1981). Conversely, decision confidence less thanwarranted by the quality of a decision can mean that too few resources andefforts are devoted to implementation. Other possibilities include foregoneopportunities, premature abandonment of a good decision, or im-plementation efforts that fail to realize the full potential of the decision.The motivational benefits of decision confidence are linked tosuccessful implementation (Hogarth, 1980; Russo & Schoemaker, 1992;Trull, 1966). Hogarth (1980) contended that for creatures needing to mastertheir environment to survive, decision confidence characterized by overreaction is far less costly than confidence characterized by inaction. AsWeick (1990) stated, when one is lost in the desert, any map is better thanno map. In business, for example, it is evident that planning for the future ismore successful than simply reacting to the actions of others. Unfortunately,the same confidence that motivates in the case of good decisions can bedisastrous with bad decisions, as any manager who has 'thrown good Bingi, Turnipseed, & Kasper BEST LAID PLANS93 money after bad' will attest (Conlon & Wolf, 1980; Fox & Staw, 1979;Staw, 1973;1981).Goal assigners are likely to be authority figures, and thus goals may fallinto the zone of indifference (Barnard, 1938) which one accepts as part ofthe psychological contract with the organization (Rousseau, 1996).Individuals with the authority to assign goals are typically viewed as havingthe right, if not the expertise, to determine those goals. The act ofassignment directly implies that the subordinates can attain the goal. Webelieve that confidence in a goal is a significant determinant of individuals'acceptance and commitment to the goal, which subsequently influences theprobability of a successful outcome.Sniezek (1992) and McIntyre (1982) proposed that decision confidencemediates efforts devoted to pursuing a course of action, and those effortsaffect the outcome success. Confidence appears to be critical in determiningcommitment, implementation effort, and ultimately, outcome success.Consequently good decisions alone may be insufficient to produce desiredoutcomes. Prior research has focused on realism in decision confidence,largely ignoring its motivational benefits and its potential impact onimplementation effort. Studies have concentrated on decision quality,neglecting decision confidence and its role in outcome success. No singlestudy has considered the relationship between decision confidence,implementation effort and outcome success. Only anecdotal evidence existsregarding the influence of decision confidence on implementation effortsand outcome success. We believe, consistent with Sniezek & Henry (1989),that confidence in the plan may be as important as quality to outcomesuccess.The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of decisionconfidence on outcome success. A decision confidence model is developedbased on decision making, strategic management,motivationalpsychology,and organizational behavior literatures, and critical aspects ofthe model areempirically assessed with structural equation analysis.Integrating the fmdings reported in the literatureregarding relationshipsbetween decision confidence, implementation effort, and outcome success,produced the model proposed in Figure 1. For simplicity, the modelassumes decision making and implementation by an individual; however,the model can easily be extended to include group situations. The researchissues are divided into primary and secondary hypotheses. Hypotheses 1-3are the primary hypotheses; the other 7 hypotheses are secondary. Eachhypothesis is designated by a number on the paths of the model in Figure 1.Figure 1 proposes that outcome success is directly affected by decisionquality and implementation effort. Through implementationeffort, outcome 94NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY success is indirectly affected by decision confidence, goal commitment,self-efficacy, goal-setting behavior, and feedback. A decision-maker's rolein the generation of computer output is also believed to affect outcomesuccess through decision confidence. According to this model, self-efficacyinfluences both goal-setting behavior (\"self-set\" goal in Figure 1) and goalcommitment, thereby indirectly affecting outcome success. Self-Efficacy H5VSelf-Set numbercorresponding to thehypothesis Figure 1.The Research Model with Hypotheses Marked on the Paths Outcome success is dependent upon decision quality, but they areequivalent in the absence ofexogenous variables. Because the real worldcontains numerous uncontrollable variables, decision quality is rarely, ifever, equivalent to outcome success. Conventional wisdom and the limitedevidence indicates a relationship between decision quality and outcomesuccess (e.g., Beyth-Marom, Dekel, Gombo, & Shaked, 1985), and link 1 ofFigure 1 proposes a positive relationship between decision quality andoutcome success. Thus the following hypothesis:HI: Decision quality has a positive impact on outcome success.Link 2 considers the effect of implementation effort on outcomesuccess. The strategic management literature firmly establishesthat withoutproper implementation, decisions are ineffective (e.g., Cravens, 1991;Digman, 1990; Thompson & Strickland, 1999), which suggests thefollowing hypothesis:H2: Implementation effort has a positive effect on outcome success. 99 Bingi, Turnipseed, & Kasper BEST LAID PLANS95 Decision confidence has been argued to influence implementationeffortas illustrated by link 3 (McIntyre, 1982). We hypothesize that the level ofimplementation effort depends upon the degree of decision confidence:H3: Decision confidence has a positive effect on implementation effort.A relationship between decision confidence and decision quality is notshown in Figure 1 because both decision confidence and decision qualityare treated as independent variables. Hence the model does not include alink between the decision quality and confidence constructs.The secondary hypotheses involve implementation effort, self-efficacy,goal-setting behavior, and feedback. Decision-making involves goal setting(Beach, 1985), and according to goal-setting theory, goals have somedegree of motivational value and they influence implementation efforts(Locke & Latham, 1990). Goals direct and energize actions as indicated bylink 4, and thus the hypothesis:H4: Goal setting is positively related to implementation effort.The personal conviction that the plans required to achieve a desiredoutcome can be successfully implemented is also important to outcomesuccess. This self-efficacy regulates one's effort and persistence in goaldirected activities (Bandura, 1977), and influences goal commitment,implementation effort, and outcome success (Frayne & Latham, 1987;Katzel & Thompson, 1990; Locke, Frederick, Lee, & Bobko,1984; Locke &Latham, 1990). Goal-setting and self-efficacy theories predict that self-efficacy affects goal setting (link 5), goal commitment (link 6) (Locke &Latham, 1990), and implementation effort (link 7) (Bandura, 1977). Theseself-efficacy relationships suggest the following hypotheses:H5: Self-efficacy has a positive effect on goal setting.H6: Self-efficacy has a positive effect on goal commitment.H7: Self-efficacy has a positive effect on implementation effort.Goal commitment is linked to outcome success (Locke & Latham,1990). Transferring a decision into implementation effort requires anappropriate level of commitment (Wernham, 1987; Milliken & Volirath,1991).There is a relationship between goal commitment and thewillingness to exert effort: all other variables being constant, outcomesuccess depends upon goal commitment and effort (Guth & MacMillan,1986), thus Hypothesis 8:H8: Goal commitment has a positive effect on implementation effort.Prior research has shown that goals combined with feedback influenceoutcome success (Locke & Latham, 1990). Feedback provides a cognitivecomparison between goals and the individual's progress, thus regulating viathe self-efficacy mechanism, the Earley, Northcraft, Lee & Lituchy, 1990). 96NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Goals have been observed to produce sustained performance effort whencombined with feedback of progress (Bandura & Cervone, 1983). Hence wehypothesize:H9: Feedback has a positive effect on implementation effort.Considering the impact of computer-generated plans on decisionconfidence and outcome success is particularly relevant as decisions areincreasingly made based on computer-generated information. The limitedresearch suggests that computer-generated material influences decisionconfidence (Freeman, 1984; Huff, 1986). Likewise, self-generated output,with or without the help of a computer-based system, has been shown toaffect confidence in the output (Northcraft, & Earley, 1989). Whether andhow changes in decision confidence resulting from the use of computer-generated plans influence outcome success is unknown. The sparse researchsuggests that self-generated computer output may have more influence ondecision confidence than output generated by others, providing thehypothesis:H10: Self-generated computer produced plans will have a greater effecton decision confidence than other-generated output.METHODTo test the hypotheses, decision confidence, decision quality, computeroutput, and feedback were manipulated. Decision confidence and qualitywere manipulated to produce high and low levels. Self-generatedcomputer-based plans were compared with other-generated plans, and subsets of theparticipants were provided with periodic feedback on their performanceprogress. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the manipulationgroups or to a non-manipulated control group.To capture the desired goal attainment data, decision confidence andquality were manipulated and the variance in implementation effort andoutcome success was measured. We selected an experimental \"decision\"that was neither extremely easy nor inordinately difficult for theparticipants, and one that would motivate students to participate in thestudy. Other criteria included the relevancy of the study to students as wellas an easily understandable protocol. Consistent with these requirements,participants were given the task of improving their reading skills.Participants were given an individualized plan developed by a readingspecialist, designed to help them reach a desired reading skill over the five-week study period, which is typical of traditional methods used to improvereading.The primary dependent variable of interest was outcome success. Otherendogenous variables were implementation effort, goal commitment, andgoal-setting behavior. Consistent with Bonoma and Clark's (1988) Bingi, Turnipseed, & Kasper BEST LAID PLANS97 recommendation, both objective and subjectivemeasures of implementationeffort and outcome success variables were recorded. The objective measuresof outcome success and goal-setting behavior were based on the Nelson-Denny Reading Test (NDRT) (1981). The NDRT score, which is a linearcombination of vocabulary and comprehension scores, is a well known andpopular measure of reading skill (Brown, Bennett & Hanna, 1981).Goal setting behavior was assessed at the beginning of the experiment.The NDRT was administered, scored, and returned to the participants.Based on the NDRT total scores, five possible goals were identified, andfollowing Locke and Latham (1990), the goals were defined so that 10%,25%, 50%, 75% and 90% of the participants could reach the goal. Thisresulted in goals of 150, 130, 115, 95 and 75 as NDRT total scores,respectively. Each participant chose one of these as his/her goal. At theend of the study, the NDRT was re-administered. The objective measure ofoutcome success was calculated as the ratio of final performance (postNDRT total score) to the target performance (goal). The subjectivemeasureof success was the participants' satisfaction with their reading skill scores atthe end of the study period.Implementation effort was also measured with both objective andsubjective measures. Objective measures included the amount of time theparticipants spent in formal practice lessons conducted by the readingspecialists,formal trainingsessions, and volunteer help sessions.Participants were not aware that these values were being recorded. Thesemeasures were averaged to obtain objective measures of implementationeffort.The subjective measure of implementation effort was the instrumentdeveloped by Earley, Wojnaroski and Prest (1987). Using the Likert scaleinstrument, each subject estimated the amount of time he/she spent outsideof the formal settings completing each lesson. Earley, Wojnaroskiand Prest(1987) reported an alpha of .73 for this questionnaire. Goal commitmentwas assessed using the instrument developed by Hollenbeck, William andKlein (1989), which measures commitment on a five-point Likert scale,and formed one factor with an alpha of .88.The independent variables were: (1) decision quality, which was thequality of the plan given to the subject to achieve his/her goal; (2) decisionconfidence, the subject's belief in the quality of the plan; (3) self- or other-generated computer output (plans); and (4) the presence or absence offeedback. Self-efficacy was a measured but not manipulated independentvariable.Individuals in real-world situations are typically given a decision in theform of a plan that someone else has developed, and they accept that 98NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY decision with varying degrees of confidence in its quality. In this study, aprofessional reading specialist developed a high decision quality (effective)or a low decision quality (ineffective) reading plan for each subject atrandom, based the subject's performance on the NDRT, the goals set, andstudy habits reported. The study habits had been collected from abiographical questionnaire administered at the beginning of the experiment.These plans were double-blind rated by two other independent professionalreading specialists employed for the study. Using a standard instrument,thethree reading specialists reported an inter-rater reliability of .94 (only 14observations out of 253 were in disagreement) for the decision quality ofthe reading plans given to the participants.Decision confidence was manipulated by the reading improvementplans. Participants were told that their reading plans would be generated byan \"expert system\" based on their demographic information, NDRT score,and stated goals. High and low confidence reading plans were generated.The high decision confidence plan described the expert system used togenerate the plan as extensively tested and highly reliable and accurate, with95% the plans generated by the system being effective. The low confidenceplan described the expert system as developmental, not extensively tested,and although the reliability and accuracy of the generated plans wereunknown, only 5% of the plans generated by the system so far had beeneffective. To assess the effectiveness of this manipulation, participantscompleted a Decision Confidence in the Quality of the Plan instrument.Feedback was also manipulated between subject groups with one groupreceiving feedback in the form of the answer key to practice lessons whichprovided instantaneous assessment of their goal-performance discrepancy.Participants in the no-feedback group did not have an opportunity to assesstheir interim performance. Precautions were taken to prevent or reduce thefeedback group from contaminating the no-feedback group. For example,feedback participants were given the answer key for the current practicelesson they were completing and only for the material related to theirreading plan. Therefore, even if the answer key became available to thosein the no-feedback group, itwas highly unlikely that it would be useful tothose participants on their practice lessons.Self-efficacy was .conceptualized in terms of magnitude and strength,consistent with Bandura (1977). These were measured based on Locke andLatham's (1990) recommendation: magnitude was measured by asking theparticipants to indicate which of the five goals (i.e., improving their NDRT by 150, 130, 115, 95,or 75 total points over the course of the study) theyfelt that they could achieve. Strength was assessed by asking theparticipants to indicate ona scale of 1 to 10 (1 = no confidence, 10 = Bingi, Turnipseed, & Kasper BEST LAID PLANS99 highest confidence) how confident they were in their ability to achieve eachof the five goals.ParticipantsStudents enrolled in a junior-level, required business course weresolicited to participate in the study. Participation was voluntary, andstudents who participated earned class credit. Students choosing not toparticipate were given other projects to earn the same amount of credit.Data from 279 participants was used in the analysis. Approximately40% ofthese par- ticipants were female, and about 50% were juniors between theages of 18-22. Fifteen of the participants were used as a control group, anddata from the remaining 253 participants was used to investigate thehypotheses.ProcedurePrior to the experiment, a biographic questionnaire was administered todetermine the participants' major area of study, GPA, and, reading habits.Participants were randomly assigned to one of the test groups defined bythe manipulations. The NDRT was administered and scored, and the results(vocabulary, comprehension, and total scores) provided to the participants.Participants completed the self-efficiency instrumentby indicatingwhich ofthe five goals (i.e., improving their NDRT by 150, 130, 115, 95, or 75 totalpoints over the course of the study) they felt they could achieve (yes or no)over the during the five-week period, and how confident they were in theirability to achieve each of the five goals (1 = no confidence, 10 = highestconfidence). Participants selected one of the five goals as their reading scoreimprovement goal. Often, this was not the goal to which the subjectassigned the highest confidence, which is entirely consistent with normalhuman behavior, as many individuals are not high achievers in variousendeavors although they may have confidence that better performance ispossible. Finally, goal commitment was measured using the instrumentdeveloped by Hollenbeck, William, & Klein (1989).Participants were provided their reading plan by either the \"chauffeur\"or the self-generated treatment as dictated by the experimental design.Participants in the \"chauffeur\" treatment were told that their plan had beengenerated using the same computer program that the other (self-generated)group was using. Accompanying each plan was information about theperformance of the fictitious \"expert system\" used to produce the plan,which was used to manipulate the subject's decision confidence in the plan.In reality, high and low quality reading plans had previously beendeveloped by the reading specialist, and based on the participant's 100NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY experimental group, either the high or low quality plan was provided by thesystem. Participants in the \"chauffeur \" - generated group were given theirreading plans by the researchers and told that the reading plan wasgenerated for them using the same \"expert system\" that the self-generatedgroup was using. Each reading plan consisted of a regime of trainingsessions to be attended, due dates for practice lessons, details for helpsessions, and grading policies. Participants were required to attend each ofthe training sessions (set out in their reading plans) which were conductedby a reading specialist. At the end of each training session, practiceassignments were given and participants were required to turn in thecompleted assignments along with an approximate amount of time theyspent on the practice lesson. Help sessions were provided by the readingspecialist to all participants, and the time spent in the help sessions wasrecorded and included as one measure of implementation effort. Finally,thequestionnaire assessing the efficacy of this manipulation, the DecisionConfidence in the Quality of the Plan questionnaire, was administered.During the course of the experiment, participants in the feedback groupwere given the answers to their practice lessons. Participants in this groupwere told that the program needed to be completed by the end of the five-week period, and because the instructor could not grade all the practicelessons in a timely manner, they had been requested to help by grading alltheir own practice lessons. Both overt and covert inquiries throughout theexperiment indicated that there was little or no contamination between thefeedback and no-feedback groups.At the end of the five-week experiment period, the NDRT was re-administered to measure the change in the participants' reading scores.After the NDRT answer sheets were scored and returned, each subject thenindicated his or her satisfaction with the performance by completing theOutcome Success Satisfaction instrument.RESULTSThe efficacy of the manipulations was verified using ANOVA.Structural equation analysis was chosen to investigate the hypothesesbecause it allows testing of simultaneous equations and whole models, isuseful when there are several constructs underlying dependent variables,provides a way tocorrect measurement error, and violations ofhomogeneity can be treated (Bagozzi & Yi, 1989).ANOVA of the pre-and post-treatment NDRT showed that theparticipants exposed to the manipulations and reading regimes performedsignificantly better than those in the control group (F = 6.71; p <.01) whoreceived neither manipulations nor reading regimes. To verify the decisionconfidence manipulation, a t-test was calculated, which indicated that the03 Bingi, Turnipseed, & Kasper BEST LAID PLANS101 decision confidence of participants in the high confidence group was greaterthan that of participants in the low confidence group (p < .05).Factor analysis of the measures of outcome success, implementationeffort, and goal commitment were unidimensional for each construct. Itemswhich constructed each of these measures cleanly loaded on threeappropriate dimensions, providing support for the validity of the scales. Themeasures of outcome success combined the objective (the ratio of thesubject's actual reading skill score to his or her goal reading skill score) andthe subjective assessment of outcome success (the participant's satisfactionwith his or her reading skill score at the end of the study period). Themeasure of implementation effort combined the average of the amount oftime the subject spent in formal practice lessons, formal training sessions,and voluntary help sessions, and the subjective measure of implementationeffort. The goal commitment instrument was also reduced to a singlemeasure. Reliability estimates (Cronbach's alpha) for each of thesemeasures was greater than .78. Structural Analysis neetteee.or-fit: 0,2 'n 274 02 cd.r.- 219. p 0.05 (onegaitret test) Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the reduced, factor-analyzed scales.

The resulting goodness of fit statistics were: .045; root mean square BEST COPY AVAILABLE 102NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY of approximation (RMSEA) = .03; fit index (NNFI) = .98; and fit index (CFI) = .98. Ofall the pairwise correlations between measurement items, only 4.1% (11)had normalized residuals greater than 2.0, which is less than the 5%expected by chance. Collectively, these measures suggest that the data areconsistent with the model in Figure 1.A structural model was estimated using maximum-likelihood in LISRELVIII (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1993). The correlation matrix of the sample datawas used to test the overall adequacy of the theorized model as well as thesignificance of the hypothesized relationships. Analysis by the proceduresrecommended by Anderson and Gerbing (1988) confirmee the discriminantand convergent validity of the instruments, with none of the confidenceintervals containing 1.0. The strongest correlation for outcome success wasimplementation effort(r =.43). For implementation effort, the next strongestcorrelation was decision confidence (r=.28). Other robust correlationsinclude self-efficacy behavior (r =.76), andgoal and goal commitment and setting behavior(r =.25).The hypothesized relationships (paths), structural coefficients, t-values,and overall goodness of fit indices are provided in Figure 2. Traditionalindices (X2(215) = 274.02 p <.01, GFI = .92, .89, NFI = .91, NNFI= .97 and RMSEA = .033), the incremental fit index (IFI = .98), and thecomparative fit index (CFI = .98), indicate that our model fits the data.Additionally, the point estimate of RMSEA is well below the .05 levelrecommended by Browne and Cudeck (1993), confirming the good fit. TheExpected Cross Validation Index (ECVI) for the model (1.57) is less thanthe ECVI for the saturated model (2.19), further supporting our model.The structural model was also compared to the measurement model(Figure 1) using the sequential chi-square difference test (SCDT) asrecommended by Anderson and Gerbing The chi-square for themeasurement model (X2m (198)) was 248.93, and for the structural model(X2s(215)), 274.02. Differences between these chi-squares was not significantx2s x2m=2dX= 25.02, 17 df), indicating that the restrictions placed on themeasurement model are reasonable.Figure 2 also presents the coefficients and t-values for each of the pathsin the structural model. The hypothesis, dependent and independentvariables, the test result, and summaries of the implications are presented inTable 1.

DISCUSSIONThe analysis provided support for two of the three primary hypothesesof interest. H2 was supported, suggesting that implementation effort has apositive effect on outcome success. Likewise, H3 was supported, sustainingour assertion that decision confidence has a positive effect on theimplementation effort. Taken together, the results suggest that decisionconfidence affects implementation effort, which affects outcome success.Participants with high implementation effort were more likely to achievetheir self-set goal and be satisfied with their performance than participantswhich had expended little implementation effort. Decisior. quality was alsoexpected to affect outcome success, and although participants with highquality plans performed marginally better than those with low quality plans,the difference was not significant, and H1 was not supported.The support of the secondary hypotheses H5 and H6 indicate that goalcommitment directly affects implementation effort, and self-efficacy directlyaffects both goal-setting behavior and goal commitment: additionally self- EST COPY AVAILABLE108 104NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY efficacy indirectly affects implementation effort. Hypothesis Hg wassupported, indicating that goal commitment has a positive impact onimplementation effort.H4 was rejected: our data showed that goal setting behavior had noeffect on implementation effort. H7 was also rejected, with self-efficacyhaving a negative rather than the hypothesized direct effect onimplementation effort. H9 was not supported, indicating that feedback doesnot affect implementation effort. Finally, as the data show no evidence thatself-generated computer output affected decision confidence more thanchauffeur-generated computer output, H10 was rejectedOur results support the basic proposition that decision confidence affectsimplementation effort. Participants in the high decision confidence groupexpended greater effort implementing their reading plans than participantsin the low confidence group. Because decision confidence has been shownto affect implementation effort, researchers should devote increasedattention to decision confidence and its antecedents. Practitioners should beaware of the effects of decision confidence on implementation effort, andrealize that good planning alone is not sufficient for good outcomes.Outcome success requires high implementation effort, and highimplementation effort requires confidence in the decision. Among thesecondary findings, self-efficiency emerged as an important contributor tooutcome success. Self-efficacy was positively related to the level of the goalset by the subject as well as his/her level of commitment to that goal. Thisimplies that individuals with high self-efficacy tend to choose harder goalsand have increased commitment to those goals. However, self-efficiencyhad a negative impact on implementation effort. Perhaps participants withlittle self-efficacy overcompensate by exerting high implementation effortto achieve their goals. Participants with high self-efficiency may feelconfident in their ability to achieve a goal and consequently fail to applythemselves and exert the implementation effort needed to execute the plan.Consistent with Locke, Shaw, Saari, and Latham (1981), participantswith high goal commitment also exerted high implementation effort. Goal-setting behavior had no affect on implementation effort, however thisunexpected result has been observed previously by Locke and Latham(1990), who referred to several studies which showed no effect of goal-setting behavior on implementation effort. They attributed these results to,among other things, lack of training, or the mismatch between performancecriteria and goals or feedback. These shortcomings and inconsistencies mayalso be responsible for the results in the present study.Feedback had no influence on implementation effort, which may havebeen due to the type of feedback employed. Research has shown thatincreased motivation is possible only when the feedback matches the Bingi, Turnipseed, & Kasper BEST LAID PLANS105 performance criteria (Earley, Wojnaroski, & Prest, 1990). The feedbackprovided to our participants was answers to practice lessons; however themeasure of performance was the total score on the NDRT. Administeringseveral versions of the NDRT periodically throughout the experiment so thatfeedback would have been consistent with the goal might have been moreappropriate.When individuals commit to a goal, perceived negative discrepanciesbetween goals and performance may serve as an additional motivator.However, at some point the negative discrepancy can become of sufficientmagnitude to reduce performance motivation (Bandura & Cerone, 1983).The negative discrepancy (i.e., the scores on the practice exams) was notmeasured in this study, and could be a contributing factor to the non-significant linkage between feedback and implementation effort. Also theself evaluation manner in which the feedback was received may haveresulted in a different motivational inducement than feedback provided byothers. The self evaluation may have been perceived as a learningexperience rather than performance feedback and thus the lack of a feedback- effort linkage.Decision confidence was not affected by how the subject receivedhis/her reading plan. Self-generated computer output was expected to affectdecision confidence more than the chauffeur-generated computer output, butthe data did not support this contention. Perhaps the level of interaction inthe self-generated treatment was not sufficiently high to engage theparticipants. Another reason for this result may be that these participantssaw no difference between generating the computer output themselves orhaving another (the \"chauffeur\") generate it for them.Decision confidence is a critical component of effective decision makingand for critical decisions, confidence is no less important than quality inoutcome success. Despite this, there has been no integrated study of therelationships between decision confidence, implementation effort, andoutcome success. The present study provides empirical evidence thatwithout confidence in the decision, the best laid plans of mice and men maygo awry. Confidence influences implementation effort, which in turn affectsoutcome success. Our results highlight the importance of decision con-fidence to implementation effort and outcome success. Prior findings thatself-efficacy influences goal-setting behavior and goal commitment wereconfirmed. We additionally demonstrated that goal commitment had apositive impact on implementation effort.These results have important implications forresearchers andpractitioners. The importance of decision confidence is apparent as is theneed to further investigate its role in implementation efforts and decisionoutcomes. Individuals in decision-making and decision-implementing 106NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY positions should be aware of the influence of decision confidence onimplementation effort and successful outcomes. This study also elucidatesthe importance of future study to understanding its role in decision makingand outcome success.REFERENCESAnderson, J., & Gerbing, D. W. (1988).

ShelladyCentral Michigan UniversityA preliminary study was conducted examining attitudes toward some ofthe requisite dispositions involved in critical thinking. The AttitudeToward Critical Thinking Scale (CTS) was used to assess dispositions relatedtocriticalthinkinginasampleof universitystudents.Elementary, secondary, and special education majors, as well as majorsclassified as Liberal Arts & Sciences, Traditional Social Sciences, andApplied Social and Health Sciences were compared. Results suggestedthat students sampled from Arts & Sciences and Traditional SocialScience are more favorably predisposed to critical thinking principlesthan are Education and Applied Social and Health Science students.Results are addressed within the context of pedagogical needs of theinformation age.Critical thinking skills have received much attention over the past twodecades. Most authors who address this subject agree that the ability tothink critically and autonomously is the cornerstone of democracy and theantidotetoauthoritarianism and closed-mindedness (Ennis,1992;Mc Peck, 1990; Paul, 1984; Siegel, 1988). It is further suggested thataccelerated discovery and information flow necessitate the developmentof thinking skills that will be adaptive to the new information en-vironment. The method of critical thinking, which finds its typicalexpression in philosophical analysis, requires a non-didactic, forum-styleclassroom environment conducive to dialog and Socratic questioning.This kind of teaching and learning is aimed at understanding theAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Martin Eigenberger, Collegeof Arts & Sciences, U. of Wisconsin-Parkside, 600 Wood Rd., Kenosha, WI53141North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 109-118.\u00a9NAJP114 110NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY underlying assumptions and logical structure of subject areas as opposedto a strict delivery of factual content (Paul, 1993). By instilling themethods and habits of critical inquiry, students will be less dependent on`the facts'- which are constantly changing. Students so educated are morelikely to become autonomous thinkers, able to extract reliable informationfrom a wide variety of sources, and able to make more incisiveinferences. However, philosophical ways of thinking, much like a secondlanguage, are best practiced early and often. Thus critical thinking shouldbe infused across the curriculum beginning in the early elementaryclassroom (Lippman, 1991).The attitude of future teachers regardingtheir readiness to implement critical thinking may be regarded as animportant and integral consideration of teacher education programs(Presseisen, 1986).Critical thinking is defined both as a psychological attitude and anintellectualskill.Itisan attitude of reflectiveskepticism and awillingness andabilitytosuspend judgement pending a criticalexamination of evidence (Mc Peck, 1981). Critical thinking is a refusal toaccept information without good reasons for belief (Siegel, 1988), andthis attitude not only attempts to examine information in analytic bits butalso pulls within its scope worldviews and personal perspectives (Paul,1984).Criticalthinkingisalso askillthat uses informal logic,philosophy, and subject-specific facts to sort out what are adequate,acceptable, or good reasons for belief.Both the attitude and skill of critical thought are as important today asin the past. Historically, critical thinkers such as Descartes systematizedan approach to knowledge acquisition and revolutionized philosophy andempirical science. Scientific methodologies initiated during the En-lightenment period have produced a seeming over-abundance of in-formation. According to Paul (1993) routinized learning, stable worldviews, and formulaic teaching are fast becoming handicapping conditionsfor individuals and societies. Accelerating change, Paul suggests, is uponus, as half the content of subject areas becomes obsolete or invalid everysix years. We are increasingly being asked to sort through a maze of newor reorganized information. Toff ler (1970) notes that from 1776 to 1960the stores of knowledge doubled. From 1960 to 1965 knowledge againdoubled. It is predicted that as we enter the year 2002, factual knowledgewill double every 73 days (Toff ler, 1990). Additional examples of theenormous amounts of information available include the 1000 new bookspublished every day and the fact that there is more information in a singleedition of the New York Times than there was in the lifetime of anindividual living in 1776 (Toffler, 1990).The use of critical thinking skills, or content-independent reason, isthe only practical way to sort out which information may be valid. As inthe past, critical thinking is necessary to guide social changes as well as Eigenberger, Sealander, Jacobs, & Shellady CRITICAL THINKING 111 those changes proposed and presented by today's educational reformmovement. If critical thought is not employed, then the field of educationmay be more likely to be driven by political agendas and market forcesrather than real cognitive and informational needs that are relavent to theadaptability of individuals and institutions. Hiring practices of cor-porations like Motorola and Honeywell are beginning to address the needfor critical thinkers. Companies like these emphasize the requirement forpotential employees to be able to independently process and use newinformation as well as work with others to creatively use the information.Given the information explosion, the notion that knowledge is power,and the needs of employers regarding the individuals they hire, criticalthinking isfast becoming a necessary survival skill. Although theacquisition of adaptive skills may be related to intelligence, the learningof critical thinking as an adaptive behavior requires practice on the partof the learner. Even if there are \"naturals\" or native critical thinkers asthere are natural artists, guided practice of critical thinking skills is stillessential.It is logical then, that critical thinking be encouraged in theclassroom.This encouragement may take the form of emphasizing theneed for good reasons rather than just correct answers, and insisting onevidence rather than opinion. The questioning of motives and as-sumptions, and the exploration of implications must be practiced. Thepractice of critical thinking also requires the acceptance and respect ofdivergent perspectives (Marzano, 1992; Slavin, 1994). Attention there-fore, to the nature and intellectual ecology of the classroom is essential,as it might well enhance or impede the development of critical thinking.To adequately deal with critical questions, the learning outcomessought by both the teacher and the student must be extended beyondmerely finding test-relevant answers, to one of exploration and reflection.To achieve these outcomes it is essential for both the teacher and studentsto tolerate the ambiguity and periodic confusion that often accompaniesthe process of discovery via critical thinking. The classroom would seemto be the ideal arena in which to nurture, practice, and implement thinkingskills (Hester, 1994).Student use of critical thinking in the classroom, although ped-agogically sound and seemingly widely accepted, can be a double-edgedsword. On the one side, the students are using skills which more fullyengage the mind in the assimilation and understanding of subjects andsubject matter. On the other side, there is the attitude of skepticism andquestioning, which may have the appearance of challenging authority,often including the teacher's authority (Bornstein, et al, 1977). Hence, forsome teachers critical thinking may be controversial. The teacher with anauthoritarian turn of mind, who works for conformity and regularity in hisor her classroom, may have something less than a full appreciation forstudents who are asking critical questions. 112NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Indeed, that teacher may view the student as threatening, non-compliant, and rude (Drabman & Patterson, 1981). It would seem that theteacher's assumptions about the nature of authority and skepticism, andthe value of justified beliefs, may affect the quantity and quality ofcritical thinking that actually takes place in the classroom.The central question of this study was: Do future educators value thecritical thinking process and the behavioral attributes of the criticalthinker, or are they more likely to ignore, limit or extinguish suchbehaviors?In an attempt to begin addressing this question, studentsenrolled in institutions of higher education volunteered to complete theAttitude Toward Critical Thinking Scale (Eigenberger, Sealander, &Seckinger,1996). The purpose of this preliminary investigation was toassess the degree to which critical thinking attitudes are present in futureeducators as compared to other university students.METHODParticipants and ProcedureParticipants in this study were 486 students enrolled in undergraduateand graduate courses in the College of Education and three other areas ofacademic discipline. Other areas were classified as, a) Traditional LiberalArts and Sciences (A&S), consisting mainly of history, philosophy,English, fine arts, and natural science majors, b) Traditional SocialScience (TSS), which was primarily made up of psychology, sociology,and political science majors, and c) Applied Social and Health Sciences(ASHS), composed of majors from fields such as criminal justice, socialwork, nursing, speech pathology, occupational therapy, and nutritionscience. The survey procedure netted participants from other disciplinaryareas such as Engineering and Business, but total numbers in thesecategories were trivial and were dropped from the analysis. A total of 22participants declared themselves as Undecided, and were included as agroup in the analysis.Participants were volunteers drawn from courses at three universitiesin the Western and Mid-western states. The largest sample of participantswas drawn from Colleges of Education and consisted of 240 students. Allof the participating institutions offered four-year, undergraduate degrees,as well as post-graduate degrees in Education. Of the Education students,114 participants (96 women, 18 men) were elementary education majors,69 (32 women, 37 men) were secondary education majors, and 58 (48women, 10 men) were special education majors. These categories withinEducation were examined to test the hypothesis that the critical thinkingdisposition of secondary education majors would differ significantly fromother majors within Education. The total Education sample contained 176women and 64 men. Mean age of the participants was 23.4 years.Ninety-five participants were A&S majors, consisting of 36 women and1 V7 Eigenberger, Sealander, Jacobs, & Shellady CRITICAL THINKING 113 59 men. Traditional Social Science consisted of 83 participants, of which45 were women and 38 were men. Applied Social & Health Sciences wasmade up of 46 participants28 women and 18 men. Of the students in theUndecided category, there were 13 women and 9 men.The CTS was administered along with a demographics page, byseveral professors who were teaching courses in a variety of disciplines.Participants were offered extra credit for completing the scale and weregiven class time for this purpose.InstrumentationItems for the CTS were developed by the authors, and were deriveddeductively from conditions assumed necessary for effectively engagingin critical and reflective thought (e.g., Dewey, 1933; Paul, 1993; Russell,1912). These necessary conditions were operationalized as statements or`sentiments' reflecting traits such as intellectual openness, faith in reason,curiosity, respect for science, willingness to suspend judgement, andindependent thinking. The CTS was designed to sample an attitudespectrum incorporating'pro'and'con'dispositionstowardcriticalthinking. It was developed as an alternative to commercially availablescales such as the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory(Facione & Facione, 1992), which is a comprehensive, reliable, but ratherlengthy, multidimensional instrument. The CTS is a relatively short scale,intended for use in omnibus survey packets, or, for example, as anexpedient indicator of the strength of the critical thinking disposition inan individual classroom. The CTS contains 15 items scaled on a 7-pointdisagree-agree Likert-type format. The scale is \"balanced,\" with 7 itemsworded in the pro direction, capturing a positive attitude toward theprinciples of critical thinking, and 8 items worded in the con direction,indexing negative attitudes toward the requisite conditions of criticalthinking. Items typical of the CTS are \"One good way to find what is true,is to doubt everything until there are good logical or scientific reasons tobelieve it\"; \"Cooperation and respect for tradition are more importantvirtues than being a critical thinker\"; and, \"In the quest for what is reallytrue, one should be prepared to doubt and perhaps discard any currentbeliefs about oneself, God, and the world.\" The CTS has a possible rawscore range from 15 to 105 points. The fifteen items comprising the CTSare listed in the Appendix.Evidence of construct validity for the CTS was collected in a separatepilot study (Eigenberger, Sealander, & Seckinger ,1996) and used CTS correlated with the following: Troldahl and Powell's(1972) of the Dogmatism Scale (r = -.54), Altemeyer's (1988)Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale (r Open-mindedness, and Inquisitiveness & Facione's (1992) California Critical Thinking Disposition 114NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Inventory (r = .68). A Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of .83 was established for the CTS in both the pilot and the present study.Factor AnalysisA principal components factor analysis was conducted followed byvarimax rotation. An initial solution produced 3 factors, the first of whichhad an eigenvalue of 4.78 and accounted for 31.9% of the variance. Thesecond factor had an eigenvalue of 1.67 and accounted for 10.6% of thevariance. A third factor had an eigenvalue of 1.12 and accounted for7.5% of the variance. Examination of the scree plot however, indicatedthe presence of two interpretable factors. A two-factor solution in factprovided the most parsimonious account of scale structure. Items loadingonto Factor 1 seemed to relate to teaching or promoting critical thinkingversus respect for tradition and practicality. Items loading on Factor 2related to a more general skepticism versus varied categories of belief.Abbreviated scale items and factor loadings are displayed in Appendix B.RESULTSTwo one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. TheANOVAs CTS scores between the academic areas, Education,A&S, TSS, ASHS, along with students classified as Undecided. Theanalysis of academic areas suggested that the groups differed significantlyon CTS scores [F (4, 480) = 17.9, p< .001]. Post hoc comparisons usingthe Tukey HSD procedure further indicated that A&S students and TSSstudents scored significantly higher than Education majors, ASHSmajors, and Undecided students.TABLE 1Summaries of CTS scores of three sub-groupswithin the College of Education and the other four non-education9 Eigenberger, Sealander, Jacobs, & Shellady CRITICAL THINKING 115 academic groups. Within the College of Education, three levels ofspecialization were selected: 1) elementary, 2) secondary, and 3) specialeducation. Results suggested significant differences in mean CTS scoresbetween the groups. [F (6, 479) = 13.3, p< .001). A follow-up TukeyHSD test revealed secondary education majors had significantly higherCTS scores than elementary education majors, but did not differsignificantly from either special education majors, ASHS majors, orUndecided students. Secondary education students scored significantlylower than both A&S and TSS majors. Means and standard deviations ofall groups are presented in Table 1.A small but statistically significant difference between males andfemales was observed in mean CTS scores as measured by a t-test. Themale respondents (M = 71.3, SD = 16.4) scored higher than femalerespondents (M = 66.5, SD = 13.0), t (482) = -3.55, p < .01.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study, are best viewed as exploratory, withlimitations on generalizability. Nevertheless, within these limitations, theresultsindicatedsignificant differences existed incriticalthinkingdispositions among severalidentifiable academic groups within auniversity population. The most salient observation was the significantdifferencesin CTS scores between Education students and bothtraditional liberal arts students and traditional social science students.Regarding critical thinking dispositions, students enrolled in Education,with the exception of secondary education majors, more closelyresembled students preparing to enter occupations such as law en-forcement, probation and parole, social work, physical therapy and so on.These occupations, while necessary and valuable, are not generallyidentified with the promotion of critical thinking-related dispositions suchas intellectual openness, wide-ranging curiosity, autonomy, and wil-lingness to suspend judgement.This study also suggested a difference in critical thinking attitudebetween majors within the College of Education. It was observed thatsecondary education majors scored significantly higher on the CTS thantheir elementary education counterparts. They also scored higher, albeitnot significantly higher, than special education and ASHS students. Thisobserved differential within Education may be due in part to thesecondary education major's tendency to be content specialists, perhapswith a deeper relationship to their subject areas. Secondary educationmajors may also enter their specialties because they have a preference forworking with students who are generally functioning at more abstractcognitive levels, where the ability to perform conceptual analysis ispossible. 116NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY While a gender differential relative to CTS scores was observed, itshould be noted that this difference may be an artifact of the sample, andexplained by the large ratio of female to male students sampled in theCollege of Educationstudents who tend to have lower CTS scores. Atany rate, the disproportionate representation of female students in thesample should not produce a great deal of confidence in the stability ofthe t-ratio.Given the exploratory nature of the study, alternative explanations forthe observed results could also be considered. For instance, the subjectssampled from the College of Arts & Sciences may not have beenrepresentative. As noted, majors from traditional humanities courses weresampled, i.e., philosophy and history. Students majoring in these areascan be expected to have a strong critical thinking orientation, since theircourse work and assessment procedures center on analytic abilities andwide general interests. The effect of sampling these majors in highproportions may be to bias CTS means for the College of Arts & Sciencesas a whole. However, this concern is muted by similar CTS scores ofstudents who were classified as Traditional Social Science majors.If the observed differences in critical thinking disposition scoresbetween Education students and other academic areas is stable, thenobvious questions in this regard arise: \"Is this difference between majorsa source of concern?\" If some Education majors value critical thinkingdispositions less than Arts & Sciences or Traditional Social Sciencestudents, then are primary and secondary American schools employingteachers who are not as prepared as they should be regarding thoseintellectual dispositions necessary for critical thinking? What effect mightthis intellectual disposition have in the way children are taught in theclassrooms? Will those teachers who are not predisposed to value andthereforeimplementcriticalthinking, regard the questioning andskeptical student as problematic? Would teachers so disposed, view theexploratory critical process as a distraction from content coverage? Onthe other hand, if teachers value the critical thinking attitude, will they bemore tolerant of student questions and open to using the logic of subjectareas as an instructional strategy(e.g.Paul,1993)? Would theintroduction of critical thinking attitudes and behaviors such as reflectiveskepticism and Socratic questioning into a classroom result in a moreproductive and ecologically stable classroom?Given the potential importance of pre-service teacher attitudes oneducating students for engaging in critical discourse and democraticliving, it is evident that such attitudes should be further examined relativeto their possible interaction with reform-oriented pedagogical changes.Should further studies confirm future educators' relative disinterest with critical thinking-related dispositions, then more attention Eigenberger, Sealander, Jacobs, & Shellady CRITICAL THINKING 117 to 'thinking skills' acquisition may be needed in certain of our teacherpreparation programs.REFERENCESAltemeyer, B.

We hypothesized thatpersons in age-dissimilar relationships would score higher on measures oftrust and unselfish love and lower on measures of jealousy than those inage-similar relationships. Results confirmed predictions.One clear indicator of healthy relationship functioning is similarity(Byrne, 1971). Persons of similar age, race and attitudes are more likelyto become attracted to one another and eventually marry than dissimilarothers (Doosje, Rojahn and Fischer, 1999; Waris, 1997). Indeed, age-discrepant often considered \"taboo\" and doomed to fail(Shehan, Berardo, Vera and Carley, 1991). With public reaction to May-December romances (such as those uniting Catherine Zeta-Jones withMichael Douglas and Anna Nicole Smith with J. Howard Marshall)largely negative,itis almost surprising that age-dissimilar partnersattract. Once the relationship is established, however, differences in agemay enhance relationship quality.Gutfield (1995), for example, cited national divorce rates that dropsignificantly among age-dissimilar spouses. He claimedthatage-discrepant intimates are better at anticipating difficulties and resolvingissues regardinglove,sex,family and finances.Consistent withsociobiological theory, it was also expected that men would enter intorelationships with younger, more fertile women and women would seekolder, more financially secure men to ensure the survival of theiroffspring (Hayes,1994). Thus, we believe that age-dissimilar re-lationships may be successful. In particular, we predicted that persons inage-dissimilar relationships would report more trust and unselfish loveand less jealousy than those in age-similar relationships.

Reported age differences between participants and theircurrent partners ranged from 0 to 20 years (M = 3). Intimates completedthe Trust Scale (Rempel, Holmes & Zanna, 1985), the Agape (unselfishlove) subscale of the Love Attitudes Scale (Hendrick & Hendrick, 1986)and the Jealousy Scale (Strzysewski and Comstock, 1991) and were thendebriefed.RESULTS AND INTERPRETATIONA median-split was performed on age differences between par-ticipants and current partners, with 0-3 years classified as age-similar and4 or more years as age-dissimilar. The median age discrepancy in theage-dissimilar group was 5.4 years, as compared to 1.3 years in the age-similar group. One-way analyses of variance were then conducted withtotal trust, agape and jealousy scores as dependent variables and agedifferences as the independent variable. As expected, partners in age-dissimilar relationships reported more trust, F (1, 322) = 4.3, p< .05,more agape (unselfish love), F (1,322) = 9.2, p< .001, and less jealousy,F (1, 322) = 11.4, than partners in age similar relationships (see Table 1).

If age is liked to maturity, and maturityis linked to relationship quality, then age-dissimilar relationships might Zak, Armer, Edmunds, Fleury, Sarris, Shatynski AGE-DISCREPANT121 work partly because at least one member of each age-discrepant couple islikely to be older than the average age for couples involved in seriousrelationships.In the future researchers may find it fruitful to examine whetherpersons in such \"taboo\" relationships have anticipated relationshipconflict and resolved key issues.

The Cognitive Style Index and the LegalProfessionin Nova Scotia: Factor-analytic D. YoungMount Saint Vincent UniversityA factor analysis of scores on the Cognitive Style Index (CSI) for asample of 615 lawyers in eastern Canada was completed. The findings ofthe present study are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a singledimension underlying cognitive style as measured by the CSI.Cognitive styles generally refer to the stable and habitual manner inwhich people process information. Messick (1976) suggested that in-dividuals have preferences for organizing information and experienceand, consistent individual differences in these ways of organizing andprocessing information and experience have come to be called cognitivestyles. They are conceptualized as stable attitudes, preferences, or habit-ualstrategies determining a person's typical modes of perceiving,remembering, thinking, and problem solving (p. 5).Further, Messick (1976) suggested that cognitive styles are consistentin manner, develop slowly and experientially and are not readily modifiedby training. They are stable and pervasive across behavioral situationsand form a part of an individual's personality. They differ from ability inthat ability focuses on the \"what\" of cognition whereas cognitive stylesfocus on the \"how.\" In general, cognitive styles are considered bi-polar,with individuals falling somewhere between the extremes. Each of theextremes has different implications for cognition and each extreme hasvalue depending on the situation.The cognitive styles of various pre-professional groups have beenexplored,forexample,informationmanagement students(Casey,Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Jeffrey D. Young, Mt. SaintVincent U., Halifax, Nova Scotia B3M 2J6.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, yok3rplo. 1, 123-130.NAJP 124NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Murphy, & Young, 1996), dental students (Chaytor, Murphy, Boyd, &LaFleche, 1991), and law students (Doucette, Kelleher, Murphy, &Young, 1998b; Townsend & Ede, 1985). Others have examined cognitivestyle among professional groups,for example,financialanalysts(Mykytyn, 1989), organizational executives (Nutt, 1993), and practisinglawyers (Doucette, Kelleher, Murphy, Reid, & Young, 1999).Some of the more widely used measures of cognitive style have beencriticized on several grounds. For example, Taylor (1989) and Payne(1987) are critical of Kirton's (1976) measure of adaptation-innovationand Atkinson (1988) has questioned the psychometric soundness of theLearning Style Inventory (Kolb, 1974). The Group Embedded FiguresTest (Witkin, et al., 1971) has been criticized because it measures ana-lytical ability not cognitive style (Widiger, Knudson, & Porter, 1980).Also, the utility of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (Myers, 1976) forlarge-scale organizational studies has been questioned because of thelarge number of items used and the time required to complete it (Allinson& Hayes, 1996).In an attempt to overcome some of the perceived difficulties with theabove measures of cognitive style, Allinson and Hayes (1996) developedthe Cognitive Style Index (CSI). The CSI was specifically designed as aneasily-administered and easily-scored instrument for use in large-scaleorganizational studies (Allinson and Hayes, 1996). Similar to the work ofMiller (1987) and Nickerson, Perkins, and Smith (1985), Allinson andHayes (1996) conceptualize cognitive style as a single dimension with anintuitive style at one end and an analytical style at the other end. Intuition\"refers to immediate judgement based on feeling and the adoption of aglobal perspective\" and analysis \"refers to judgement based on mentalreasoning and a focus on detail\" (Allinson & Hayes, 1996, p. 122).People tend to favour one cognitive style over another and their style mayfall along a continuum between the two end points of intuition andanalysis.A preliminary factor analysis of the Cognitive Style Index wascompleted to examine the assertion of Allinson and Hayes (1996) thatcognitive style is unidimensional. Members of the legal profession wereselected because they represent a large and important professional group.Further, this group isquite different in terms of its training andprofessional practise from the groups of management students andorganizational managers used by Allinson and Hayes (1996). Thisaddresses the request of Allinson and Hayes (1996) for \"Application ofthe CSI across a range of organizations and nations ...\" (p.131). Murphy, Doucette, Kelleher, Reid, & Young COGNITIVE STYLE125 METHODParticipantsA total of 615 members of the Bar Society of Nova Scotia completedthe CSI. There were 387 (63%) men who ranged in age from 25 to 85years with a mean age of 43.8 years (SD=9.9). There were 228 (37%)women ranging in age from 25 to 76 years, with a mean of 37.2 years(SD=7 .8).InstrumentThe CSI consists of 38 items, for example,\"Ifinddetailed,methodical work satisfying,\" to which subjects respond True (T), False(F), or Uncertain -(?). Depending on the statement, a score for eachstatement can be \"0,\" \"1,\" or \"2,\" consequently total individual scores canrange from 0 - 76. A low score is indicative of a more intuitive style anda high score is indicative of a more analytical style. Although the in-strument is relatively new there is support for its psychometric soundness.For example, Allinson and Hayes (1996) reported a coefficient ofstability for test-retest of the CSI of .90, with four weeks between tests,for a group of management students. Doucette et al. (1998a) reportedinternal consistency coefficients ranging from .84 to .87 for a sample oflaw school students. Doucette, et al.(1998b) reported internal consistencycoefficients ranging from .75 to .88 and a coefficient of stability for test-retest of the CSI of .89, with three weeks between tests, for a sample ofbusiness undergraduates.Allinson & Hayes (1996) suggested that the CSI has concurrentvalidity because it was capable of discriminating between groups thatwere presumed to differ in cognitive style. Research on gender dif-ferences in cognitive style has been mixed. For example, Agor (1986)suggested that women tended to be more intuitive than men, whereasKirton (1989) reported that men might be more intuitive than women.The results of Allinson and Hayes (1996) showed that women scoredhigher on the CSI (i.e., had a more analytical style) than did men, in fourout of five samples. Further, women scored significantly higher on theCSI than did men in a study of law students (Doucette, et al., 1998a) andin a study of business administration undergraduates (Doucette et al.,1998b). However, MacGillivary, Murphy, Reid, and Young (1999) foundCSI scores for women co-op undergraduates did not differ significantlyfrom those of men co-op undergraduates.Based on selective recruitment and socialization Allinson & Hayes(1996) suggested that cognitive styles might differ not only betweenorganizations but also between functions within organizations. Thesignificant differences in CSI scores among several functional groups 126NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY within a broader group of practising managers was offered as evidence ofthe concurrent validity of the scores produced by the CSI. Further,Townsend and Ede (1985) reported that law students who preferredprosecution as a field of practise were more analytical in style than thosewho preferred defence as a field of practise. Using the CSI, Doucette, etal. (1998b) examined the cognitive styles of Canadian law students andfound that those who preferred the field of litigation scored significantlyhigher than those who preferred the field of corporate/commercial law.This finding is also supportive of the concurrent validity of CSI scores.ProcedureThe CSI was included with a cover letter and a self-addressed,stamped envelope in a regular monthly information package distributedby the Nova Scotia Bar Society to its 2200 members. Without any followup 615 responses were received, a response rate of 28%.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTable 1 presents means and standard deviations by item for the Index.TABLE 1 Means and standard deviations by item for Hayes (1996), parcels of inter-correlating items were 'created by means of a Principal Components130 Murphy, Doucette, Kelleher, Reid, & Young COGNITIVE STYLE127 Analysis performed on the correlation matrix of the 38 items in the CSI(this matrix is not reported here but is available upon request). This isdone in order to overcome the tendencies of inter-item correlations to below (Kline, 1993) and for individual items to be unstable as singlevariables (Nunnally, 1978). This parcelling process creates objective andhomogeneous parcels (Cattell, 1973) which brings \"factors by the moreexact rotation then possible to greater conceptual precision.\" (Cattell,1974, p.103).The scree plot indicated that approximately five, six or seven-parcelsolutions were appropriate, however upon analysis of the respectivesolutions six was considered a more efficient and interpretable solution.The six parcels account for 39.7% of the total variance in the original 38items. We note that a Principal Factor Analysis yielded similar in-terpretations, as expected, since the number of variables exceeded 30(Gorsuch, 1983).Table 2 presents the inter-correlations among the six parcels. Anexploratory factor analysis was completed on this matrix and the results,without rotation,identified one dominant underlying factor whichaccounted for 49.1% of the variance in the parcels. Table 3 presents thefactor loadings in the one-factor solution and the associated eigenvalue,and the eigenvalues and cumulative explained variance for the factoranalysis of the six parcels.TABLE 33Note: Decimal points removed from all coefficients The findings of the present study are consistent with the hypothesisthat there is a single dimension underlying cognitive style as measured bythe CSI. 128NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY TABLE 3Loadings on 1st Factor, Associated Eigenvalues and Cumula-tive Explained Variance for the Factor Analysis 4 Factor 5 Factor 6Eigenvalue2.940.810.700.560.520.47Cumulative.49.63.74.84.921.00 REFERENCESAgor, W.

ShaughnessyEastern New Mexico UniversityNAJP: You recently authored a book called Our Labeled Children andedited a book on learning disabilities. What prompted you to venture intothis realm ?RS: Our research generally is on the topic of abilities, and of course, thiscategory includes \"disabilities\" as well. In all cases, we are interested inunderstanding the nature of abilities and disabilities, how to identifythem, and how to help all people capitalize on their strengths andcompensate for or correct their weaknesses. In our book, Our LabeledChildren (Sternberg & Grigorenko, Perseus Books, 1999), we argue that,at some level, everyone has one or more disabilities. No one is good ateverything. What differs is whether the particular disability or disabilitiesthey have are labeled by society as such. In other words, upon birth,everyone is entered into a lottery. The lottery is whether the society theyare in values their abilities, and whether it recognizes their particularweakness(es) as fitting into the category of \"disabilities.\"NAJP: What are the difficulties in identifying children and adolescentswith learning disabilities ?RS: For reasons we describe in Our Labeled Children, difference scoresbetween IQ and reading or other achievement scores are worse thanworthlessthey are positively misleading. As a society, we are lockedinto a system that is psychologically and educationally invalid and thatdisgraces professionals who use it. Either they know better and use itbecause they have to, or they don't know better, in which case thesituation is even worse. In brief, the problems with difference scorespertain to several factors. First, it has been known for many years thatdifference scores are psychometrically unreliable. Second, IQ tests areAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Michael Shaughnessy,Psychology Dept., Eastern New Mexico U., Portales, NM 88130.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 131-138.NAJP 1 3 132NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY inadequate as comprehensive measures of intelligence. Even psychol-ogists who believe in the value of such tests recognize that they are onlypartial measures of intelligence. Third, there has been an utter failure todemonstrate that people with large differences between measuredintelligence and achievement should be treated any differently fromchildren with low achievement, regardless of IQ. In other words, thedifference score is gratuitous. Fourth, the IQ tests often contain verbalmaterial, so that some of the same variation that is in the IQ score is alsoin the achievement score, rendering the difference score silly because themeasures are not psychologically independent. Fifth, using nonverbal IQtests does not help, because they are even more limited in what theymeasure than are broader IQ tests. Sixth, difference scores lead toregression artifacts. Seventh, differences between IQ and achievementmean different things at different points along the continuum of abilitiesand achievement. A child could actually be labeled as having a readingdisability even if his or her reading is above average, if the IQ is highenough. Finally, the populations on which IQ tests and achievement testsare normed are often different, so that the scores being subtracted are noteven standardized scores relative to the same population. For these andother reasons, societal practices in the United States are inadequate.Learning disabilities should be identified on the basis of low achievementwithout taking into account IQ.NAJP: What are the biological bases of reading disabilities?RS: Thereisno singlebiologicalbasisfor readingdisabilities.Differences in the planum temporale between children with and withoutreading disabilities have been identified. But the important thing torealize is that we cannot, at this point, state that these are actually\"bases,\" that is, causal. We have established only correlations, and theydo not apply to all forms of reading disabilities.NAJP: What are the genetic bases of reading disabilities ?RS:Many kinds of reading disabilities run in families. Differencesbetween children with and without reading disabilities have beenidentified on chromosomes 1, 6, and 15. But these effects appear to bediffuse. It is unlikely that there is any one gene for reading disabilities.We live in a time when many people want to find a gene for everything.This mentality will not help us understand the complex interactionsbetween genes and environment in the production of reading disabilities.A given genotype does not guarantee that a person will or will not have a1;3:6 Sternberg & ShaughnessyINTERVIEW133 reading disability. Genes always have their effects in interaction with theenvironment.NAJP: What are the cognitive concerns and bases of reading disabilities?RS: Most childrenwithreadingdisabilitieshavedifficultiesinphonological processing of lexical information. But as we discuss in OurLabeled Children (and also in Offirack, a book by Louise Spear-Swerlingand myself published in 1996), there can be multiple cognitive signs ofreading disabilities. For example, phonological deficits can lead to laterproblems in verbal comprehension, so that what starts off as a problem ofone kind later becomes a problem of another kind. Moreover, somechildren have a particular problem with automatization, so that they endup processing in a controlled and often halting manner information thatother children can process automatically.NAJP: You focus in your book, Our Labeled Children, on readingproblems. What can you add about kids with spelling learning disabilitiesand math disabilities?RS: Less is known about spelling and math disabilities than aboutreading disabilities. Math disabilities, like reading disabilities, appear tohave complex causes. There is no one \"math disability.\" Some childrenhave problems with computation, others with problem solving, and stillothers with numerical comparisons. It is important to realize as well thatindividuals may be falsely labeled as having a mathematical disabilitywhen in fact their problem is fear of mathematics.NAJP: How can parents ensure that their children receive the help,accommodations and modifications that they need and deserve in theschools?RS: If parents believe that their children are receiving inadequateservices in school, they have several options. First, they can go to apsychologist to have their child assessed. This assessment may be usefulif parents suspect a disability that the child's school is unwilling toacknowledge. Second, they can discuss with the school further ac-commodation or modification of curriculum or expectations. Third, theycan work with their children at home. Fourth, they can find anotherschool that is more willing to work with their child. Finally, in extremecases, they can appeal to the district if they believe the school is nothandling their child in an adequate way. Some parents sue, but such suits3'7 134NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY are messy, expensive, slow to conclusion, and often of little help to thechildren.NAJP: What still needs to be done in terms of learning disabilities ?RS: The main things that need to be done are the creation of bettermeans of identification and the formulation of better curricula for helpingchildren with learning disabilities. We are in favor of accommodations ifthe accommodations help children remediate their deficits. Otherwise, webelieve that, in the long run, the accommodations are not always helpful.All children need to find ways of capitalizing on strengths and ofcompensating for or correcting weaknesses.NAJP: Is there a best test, or I.Q. test or achievement test for identifyingkids with learning disabilities?RS: I do not think there is any one test that is an all-purpose test. Forone thing, IQ tests should not even be used. A number of tests exist foridentifying reading problems. It is not appropriate here, really, to pro-mote certain tests over others.NAJP: Do some children outgrow or grow out of learning disabilities?RS: No, children do not outgrow learning disabilities. Children who havereading disabilities have these same disabilities as adults. What maychange, individual's successin dealing with thedisabilities.Often, children remediate compensatory strategies. Even if the symptoms go away,however, the underlying problems do not. It is especially important tofind a life path that enables us to make the most of what we do well. Forexample, many children with disabilities have to develop their creativeand practical skills in order to learn how to adjust to their disabilities.They may be able to find a career that enables them to capitalize on theseskills.Many highlysuccessfuladultswereidentifiedashavingdisabilities as children, or had and continue to have such disabilities,whether or not the disabilities were identified.NAJP: What about medication? Is it helpful?RS: Medication has been found to be helpful in some cases of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder. The decision to use medication has to bemade by a physician. The long-term side effects of medications are notwell understood.138 Sternberg & ShaughnessyINTERVIEW135 NAJP: What are the current concerns in terms of learning disabilities?Where is the field going? Or are we still mired in a quagmire of the past?RS: In education, the field continues to be mired in a political quagmirethat pits tremendous vested interests on all sides against the best interestsof children. When any system is adopted, certain groups of people benefitfrom the system and want to leave it in place. This has happened withLD, as it has happened with any other system in society. In psychology,research moves ahead at a rapid pace. Very exciting research is beingdone at the biological and cognitive levels. For example, psychologistsare interested in pinpointing the various cognitive signs of various LDs,and biologically oriented researchers are linking various LDs to bothgenetic and brain functioning.NAJP: Who is currently contributing to the field?RS: Oh, there are many people. We tried to include some of the mostdistinguished contributors in our edited book, Perspectives on LearningDisabilities (Sternberg & Grigorenko, 1999, Westview Books).NAJP: How much can tests tell us about learning disabled kids, howthey learn and why they are having difficulty?RS: Tests can give us diagnostic information, which can then be used inan advisory manner. Tests should be a beginning in the diagnostic andremediation processes, not an end. Skilled professional judgment alwayshas to be brought to bear in interpreting the results of tests.NAJP: Are there neglected learning disabilities? For example, writtenexpression, speaking, listening, and the like?RS: Different societies have different skills that are of particular value,and may choose to label people who are somewhat deficient in thoseskills as having a disability. This becomes clear if one considers the factthat in preliterate societies the concept of reading disability makes nosense. The biological or cognitive pre-dispositions may be there, butthese pre-dispositions do not manifest themselves in the environment. Iam weak in spatial abilities, but our society does not choose to recognizespatial skills, or the lack thereof, as a basis for a disability. However, in ahunting-gathering society, lack of spatial ability may be very com-promising to adequate adaptation. Those who cannot hunt successfullyliterally may die.139 136NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY NAJP: What roles do auditory memory, visual memory and the likeplay in learning disabilities?RS:Poor memory is not generally included in the list of disabilitiesrecognized in the United States, but as I said above, any list of dis-abilities is somewhat arbitrary. Poor memory is likely to lead to lowerscores on conventional tests of intelligence, because such tests relyheavily on memory (e.g., of vocabulary words, or how to solve particularkinds of arithmetic problems, or of general information). Poor memorycan also affect scores on tests of reading or mathematics because one hasto remember specific words or arithmetic skills. This is another casewhere the subtraction of an achievement score from an intelligence scoredoes not make sense: Both are dependent on memory, so that the twoscores are not independent, even though they would have to be for thesubtraction to make sense.NAJP: What are the two types of approaches to understanding L.D.Why are they important?RS: Two major approaches are sometimes referred to as intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic view is that learning disabilities are largelybiological and inborn. The extrinsic view is that learning disabilities arelargely environmentally cause and acquired. Both view are incomplete.Learning disabilities result from interactions between biology andenvironment. Simplistic answers to psychological problems areat-tractive, but often wrong!NAJP: Whataretheprosand consof accommodations and modifications? What are the pros and cons of using technology(calculators, cassette players, spell check, and the like) for learningdisabled students?RS:Accommodations are useful to help students remediate deficits.The problem is that it has not been shown that any of the currently usedaccommodations benefit only students with learning disabilities. On thecontrary, every accommodation currently used also benefits other stu-dents. For example, almost any student will benefit from extra time ontests. Similarly, almost any student will benefit from being able to take atest in quiet room free from distraction. So what our society has done isto create a system that gives an advantage to certain students, who maywell be deserving of the advantage, without having a clear rationale forwhy other students are not given this advantage. This system encouragesparents to go shopping fbr an LD diagnosis and to keep shopping until140 Sternberg & ShaughnessyINTERVIEW137 they find someone willing to give it. The system as it exists is inequitableand needs to be revised. Our goal should be to provide the best possibleeducation for all students. The current system is not there yet.NAJP:What are your main recommendations stemming from OurLabeled Children and your other edited book on Learning Disabilities?RS:First, we need to make decisions about separate services forchildren with learning disabilities on the basis of matched educationaland social agendas. For example, if we are going to make ac-commodations in the schools, then we need to make them in theworkplace. Otherwise, we are preparing students for careers they may notbe able adequately tofulfill.Jobs should reflect the educationalopportunities that lead to them. Second, we must stop using discrepancyscores right away. Third, we should, identify children for learningdisabilities on the basis of achievement alone. Fourth, we should try toprevent the development of full-blown disabilities as early as possible,rather than waiting for them to be remediated once they have fullymanifested themselves.Finally, we need to help all students capitalizeon strengths and to remediate or compensate for weaknesses.NAJP: What questions have I neglected to ask?RS: The main thing we need at thispointisan integration ofpsychological knowledge with educational practice. Current educationalpractices of children with learning disabilities often reflect the state ofpsychological knowledge ten or even twenty years ago. Psychologistshave to find a way of communicating with educators, and educators haveto be ready and willing to listen. 138NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY REFERENCESSpear-Swerling, L., & Sternberg, R.

Interdisciplinarity and the Cross-Training ofClinical Psychologists: CareersDaniel HollandUniversity of Arkansas at Little Rock\"I feel more contented when I remember that I have two professions, and notone. Medicine is my lawful wife and literature my mistress. When I am boredwith one I spend the night with the other. Though this is irregular, it is notmonotonous, and besides neither really loses anything through my infidelity.\"Anton Chekov, 1888The practice of clinical psychology in traditional settings may providelesscareer satisfaction and opportunities than in thepast. Manypsychology graduates have pursued specialization and sub-specializationin reaction to an unfavorable supply/demand ratio of clinical andcounseling psychologists in the job market, attempting to compete withother psychologists by achieving highly focused expertise. An alternativesolution is to expose psychology graduate students to interdisciplinaryeducation and cross-training that allows them to pursue hybrid careers.Six tracks are outlined for interdisciplinary preparation and the potentialdevelopment of hybrid health. descriptionof each of the fields identified for interdisciplinary education and cross-training is presented. Each description is followed by the potentialadvantages to psychologists of cross-training in that field, and commonprerequisites for advanced study in the field are listed. The need forsignificant changes in graduate education and promotion of diverseleadership in clinical psychology is discussed.There is a growing realization that the practice of clinical psychologyin traditional settings may hold less professional promise than in the past.The rapid development of managed care in medical and mental healthsettings has resulted in diminished rewards and liberty for many clinicalpsychologists. As predicted over a decade ago, economic, social, po-litical, and internal forces have contributed to decline in the earningpotential of solo private practice (Cummings & Duhl, 1987, p. 85).Furthermore, the traditional practice of psychology in medical settingsAuthor's Info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Daniel Holland, Dept. ofPsychology, U. of Arkansas at Little Rock, 2801 S. University Ave., Little Rock,AR 72204. dcholland@mail.valr.eduNorth American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 139-170.NAJP4.43 140NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY has been beset with difficulties due, in part, to the turbulence of healthcare in general, as well as the implicit perception of psychologists as\"guests\" in a domain dominated by physicians who, themselves, areexperiencing significant upheaval.Despitetheconstriction and downsizing that isoccurringintraditional clinical settings, however, clinical psychologists retain anenormous advantage over many other disciplines. First, a distinctionmust be made between the profession of psychology, some areas ofwhich are suffering, and the discipline of psychology, which continues toprovide the potential for significant advantages to those educated in it.More than many other applied disciplines,educationinclinicalpsychology, in addition to technical abilities,involves very broadconcepts andskillsthat lend themselvestoversatileapplication.Knowledge of such domains as behavioral health, group processes, andprinciples of motivation has a vast range of utility beyond the traditionalmental healthclinicorinpatient medicalsetting(Hayes,1996).Likewise, the ability to conduct and analyze research, accomplish teamgoals despitedifferingindividual perspectives, and recognize en-vironmental as well as infra- personal contributions to behavior is asignificant advantage in virtually any work setting (Hayes, 1996). Thisknowledge and these skills, stemming from education in the discipline,can be applied in innovative ways that extend professional opportunitiesand enhance career trajectories for clinical psychologists. In order tocapitalize upon the potential versatility of the clinical psychologydiscipline, however, career tracks must be significantly diversified andnew work settings must be entered. One way to achieve greaterdiversificationofpsychologists'professionalrolesandcareeropportunities is to increase interdisciplinary education and cross-trainingof clinical psychologists at the graduate and post-graduate levels.The Need for Alternatives to Psychological Sub-SpecializationThe profession of psychology has been undergoing two paths ofdevelopment.On the one hand, the \"sphere of legitimacy\" for theapplication of psychology, in terms of what is studied, where it ispracticed, and how it is delivered has expanded significantly in recentdecades (Kohout, 1993; Schneider, 1981). This trend towards pro-fessional breadth and diversification isparticularly evident inin-dustrial/organizational (I/0) psychology, which has gained influence inmanagement, education, research, and policy (Keita & Jones, 1990;Offerman & Gowing, 1990). On the other hand, another path ofdevelopment, one most closely associated with clinical psychology,could be conceived as emphasizing specialties and subspecialties(Matarazzo, 1983; Mattis, 1999). This path has involved apportioning44 HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 141 intellectualterritory,distinguishingbetween\"types\"ofclinicalknowledge, and emphasizing partially separate identities within theprofession. These separate identities, commonly identified assub-specialties within the field of clinical psychology, are built upon ameritocracyof appropriatelyidentifiedpost-doctoraltraining andsubspecialty board diplomas. This professional development has par-ticularly been advocated for clinical and counseling psychologists inmedical settings (e.g. Roberts, 1998; Wiens, 1993).There has been a continuing debate regarding how to accuratelydefine specialties and subspecialties within psychology (Belar,1995;Krauss, Ratner, & Sales,1997; Zilberg & Carmody, 1996). Onedefinition set forth by the Division of Clinical Psychology (Division 12)of the APA and the Council of University Directors of ClinicalPsychology (CUDCP) identified clinicalpsychology asa\"field\"(Resnick, 1991) that provides the foundation for specialties such ashealth psychology or neuropsychology (Wiens, 1993). These specialties,inturn, presumably, provide the foundation for newly developingsubspecialties such as pediatric neuropsychology (Mattis, 1999).It remains unclear from an empirical standpoint whether the emphasison developing highly specialized areas of clinical psychology hasresulted in improved clinical services (e.g. Faust, Guilmette, Hart, Arkes,et al, 1988) or whether this emphasis, by itself, realistically preparesstudents for the actual professional landscape (Prieto & Avila, 1994). Itmust be acknowledged, however, that some clinical specialties andsubspecialties have allowed for crucial development of the field (Belar,1997), particularly in terms of identifying how psychological principlescan be applied in new and previously underserved health care settings.Furthermore, knowledge within the discipline of psychology has becomevast enough that few people can master all of it, particularly for clinicalapplication. On an intuitive level, if not an empirical one, specializedclinical knowledge and skills seem necessary for the increasinglysophisticated clinical settings in which psychologists find themselves(Belar, 1997). The question arises, then, as to how clinical psychologistswill be able to pursue sophisticated specialties and sub-specialties in thefield, continuing this intuitively valuable development in psychology,while remaining versatile and adaptable professionals. The answer may lie with a new model of graduate education that allows for thedevelopment of hybrid careers, so that one is able to adopt clinicalspecialization without sacrificing career versatility.Re-incorporating All of Psychology's Educational LevelsIn addition to an alternative to subspecialization, a new model ofeducation is needed to address the needs of terminal masters degree 142NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY graduates in clinical psychology. George Miller (1969) noted thirty yearsago that \"We are not physicians; the secrets of our trade need not bereserved for highly trained specialists. Psychological facts should bepassed out freely to all who need and can use them\" (p. 1070). His pointwas that it is the discipline's potential to contribute to diverse areas andinterests that makes it most valuable, not its ability to cordon-off an areaof practice which, as evidenced by the increasing presence of otherprofessions in traditional psychological practice areas, is not reallycordoned-off atall.Despite such admonitions,the profession ofpsychology has increasingly tried to protect clinical practice throughgatekeeping: attempting to reserve the practice of clinical service fordoctoral level clinicians by eliminating or restricting licensure at themasters level in many states (Kohout, 1993; Sleek, 1996). However,unlike medicine, which has historically succeeded in establishing sharpboundaries around its professional activities (Starr, 1982, p.225), clinicalactivities engaged in by psychologists are highly permeable, and otherindependently licensed professionals, such as social workers, nurses, orrehabilitation counselors, have successfully assumed clinical respon-sibilities while some of psychology's own practitioners, such as masterslevel clinicians, have been denied professional access (Kohout, 1993;Sleek, 1996).The restriction and denial of professional access for masters levelpsychology clinicians has occurred despite there being no definitiveempirical evidence suggesting masters level clinicians are less effectivethan doctoral level psychologists in many clinical activities (Faust et al,1988; Goldberg, 1968; Le li & Filskov, 1981, 1984). Furthermore, thisdevelopment within psychology of denying state licensure to masterslevel practitioners, despite the lack of empirical support for suchdifferentiation, could be considered inconsistent with other initiatives inthefield:itisoccurringatthe same time many doctoral levelpsychologists are trying to obtain prescription privileges, arguing there isclinical and empirical evidence that doctoral level psychologists are aseffective in prescription skills as medically trained psychiatrists (Resnick,DeLeon, & VandenBos, 1997). What is needed at this time is a neweducational model in clinical psychology, one that: 1) does not disruptthe existing scientist-practitioner model of clinical psychology education;2) allows continued pursuit of specialties and sub-specialties withoutsacrificing employability; and 3) allows both masters and doctoral levelgraduates to benefit from education in the discipline. These threeobjectives can be accomplished by developing a new model of graduateeducation that uses the discipline of clinical psychology as one half of aprofessional hybrid, incorporating the knowledge and skills from other HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 143 fields in order to create a truly adaptive collection of professionalabilities.Interdisciplinarity and Cross-Training: Specializing in BreadthA recurring theme in humanities education is interdisciplinarity(Boyer, 1990, p. 21; Klein, 1990, p. 5;Kockelmans, 1979, p. 26), and inhealth care settings there is a growing emphasis on cross-training(Brauzer, & refers to the educationof individuals across broad domains of knowledge, similar to the goals ofa liberal arts education. Interdisciplinarity involves unifying domains ofknowledge to address larger questions (Mourad, 1997), not discouragingthe pursuit of specialized knowledge, but expanding the context of anyspecialization. This can be accomplished by fostering education in morethan one field, preparing students of psychology to become educated inother disciplines at an advanced level. With an interdisciplinary approachto education and training, there is an emphasis upon joining togethertypically separate or isolated areas of knowledge for the purpose of cross-fertilization of ideas, research, and application:Today, interdisciplinary and integrative studies, long on the edges ofacademic life, are moving toward the center, responding both to newintellectual questions and to pressing human problems. As the boundariesof human knowledge are being dramatically reshaped, the academysurely must give increased attention to the scholarship of integration(Boyer, 1990, p. 21).Interdisciplinarity also incorporates empirical efforts as well asclinical knowledge. In fact, interdisciplinary inquiry is increasinglyperceived as complementary to highly specialized and focused clinicalresearch:New knowledge, represented in the category of original research, is oflimited usefulness if it is not integrated into a larger body of concepts andfacts.For this reason, the integration or synthesis of knowledge is asvaluable and as difficult as the generation of original data. A qualitysynthesis will reveal new patterns of meaning and can advance the fieldby creating new knowledge based on the integrative framework.(Halpern, Smothergill, Baker, Baum, et al, 1998).Associated withinterdisciplinarity,\"cross-training\" has a moretechnical connotation and refers to the acquisition of specific skillsgarnered from separate disciplines, such as learning both nursing skillsand psychotherapy skills,or psychological consultation skills andpersonnel management, rather than specializing in just one of these areas.The emphasis on interdisciplinarity and cross-training is not necessarilycounter to the emphasis on specialization, since it does not precludespecialization as one component of a broad, interdisciplinary education: 144NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY specialized knowledge can still be sought, but it can be sought inconjunction with education and training in other disciplines and skills.The Task Force of the Society for the Teaching of Psychologyrecently proposed changes to the very manner in which scholarship inpsychology is conceived and judged, calling for a broader view of whatconstitute scholarly activities, consistent with Boyer's (1990) proposals in his seminal book, Scholarship Reconsidered (Halpern et al, 1998).Interdisciplinary innovations within the larger academic community are already occurring.For example, an arrangement at Tulane Universitycalled the Interdisciplinary Scholars Network focuses on creating aninterdisciplinary network of graduate and professional students who caninteract and share knowledge through organized meetings and a lectureseries.Students participating in this network do not sacrifice their areasof specialized interest, but have the opportunity to reframe these interestsin an interdisciplinary context among students from related and distantdisciplines.Within thediscipline of psychology, thepsychology department ofSeattleCentral Community College developedaCoordinated Studies Program based on a collaborative-learning modelthat links the discipline of psychology to multiple other disciplines in order to promote breadth of knowledge (Finley, 1995). Similarly,Industrial/Organizational (I/O) psychology in general has been successfulin achieving an interdisciplinary educational mission while preserving itsown identity as a field within the broader discipline of psychology(Arthur & Benjamin, 1999, p. 100). These innovative and adaptive ap- proaches to education herald a new era in preparing students for theworld of work. In a time of rapid change in health and mental healthsettings (Broskowski, Marks, & Budman, 1994,p.1; Wheatley, interdisciplinarity and cross-training may represent oneof the most adaptive and constructive approaches to the education ofclinical psychologists in graduate programs.A Proposal for Hybrid Careers in PsychologyThere has been a growing and persistent call for clinical psy- chologists to become more familiar with other disciplines in order tobecome more versatile and extend the influence of the profession morebroadly (i.e. Bray, accounts, however, of actual interdisciplinary or cross-trainingmodels linking psychology to other disciplines at the graduate level.Notable examples of graduate interdisciplinary education in psychologyare the psychology and law programs, such as those at the University ofNebraska's interdisciplinary graduate program in which students can gain a Ph.D. or masters in psychology as well as a law degree, or the HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 145 interdisciplinary programs in law and psychology at Simon FraserUniversity in British Columbia (Ogloff, 1999). Despite the greaterversitility of psychology as a discipline, medical education has actuallymore aggressively pursued interdisciplinary educational options: manymedical schools have offered interdisciplinary and dual degree programsfor many years (e.g. Raymond, 1999). Some innovative proposals andpublished anecdotal examples of interdisciplinarity and cross training inpsychology include: interdisciplinary study of psychology and gov-ernment policy(Walley,1995);uniting psychology with nursing(Thomas, 1996); psychologists learning to conduct physical examinations(Folen,Kellar,James,Porter, & Peterson,1998);andtrainingpsychologists in psychopharmacology for the purpose of prescriptionprivileges (i.e. Brentar & McNamara, 1991).Rather than pursuit of highly specialized clinical post-doctoraltrainingas the only form of post-graduate professional educationencouragedinclinicalpsychology,itisproposedherethatinterdisciplinarityandcross-traininginotherfields,inlieuofsubspecialtypost-doctoralresidenciesforsomeindividuals,canpotentially serve the profession of clinical psychology, its graduates, andthe public very effectively. The cross-trained psychologist would be ableto enter more than one professional arena, bringing with her theknowledge and professionaltitle of a clinical psychologist as sheinfluences and shapes other fields that are usually beyond the directinfluence of most psychologists. Equally important, her own careeroptions would be enhanced during a time of increasing constraint inmany clinical psychology roles.If clinical psychology graduate students were exposed to coordinatedinterdisciplinarity as part of their graduate curriculum, they couldsubsequently pursue cross-training in another field upon completion oftheir degree program in psychology, thereby receiving what wouldfunctionally be post-graduate training in another independent professionand achieving a hybrid education. The psychologist-public healthspecialist, psychologist-nurse practitioner, psychologist-massage ther-apist, or psychologist-business manager would be in a position to pursuea greater diversity of professional opportunities and avoid temporaryrecessions in any one field. Furthermore, like the psychologist-attorneyeducated in one of theM.A./ J.D. or Ph.D./J.D. programs, theseadditional hybrid professionals would bring a synergistic knowledge toboth fields and to the public.In order to be prepared to enter advanced education in another fieldupon completion of masters or doctoral education in clinical psychology,graduate programs facilitating this cross-training model would need toincorporatetheotherdiscipline'sprerequisitesintothegraduate 146NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY psychology curriculum. For example, a graduate psychology studentmight be taking coursesin computer programming, managementinformation systems, and engineering, in addition to psychology corecourses, in order to qualify, upon graduation, for advanced post-doctoralstudy of a technological field like Information Technology.What follows are brief outlines of six broad hybrid paths forinterdisciplinary learning and cross-training, linking hybrid has not been included here,since that particular model has been covered extensively elsewhere (e.g.Bersoff, Goodman-Delahunty, Grisso, et al, 1997). Likewise, the cross-training necessary for psychologists to obtain prescription privileges isnot included here, as that model has been given extensive considerationpreviously (e.g. DeLeon, 1993; Resnick, DeLeon, & VandenBos, 1997)and, until laws are changed, does not presently constitute a career optionfor psychologists.The emphasis of each of the six outlines is on: 1) a brief description ofthe field proposed for cross-training; 2) the advantages to psychologistsof pursuing cross-training in that specific field; and 3) the prerequisites orrecommended course work that would have to be incorporated into thegraduate psychology curriculum in order to facilitate post-graduate cross-training in the outside field. Such prerequisites or recommended coursework (beginning accounting, for example, for those students wishing toprepare for both psychology and business; or anatomy and physiology forthose wishing to pursue both psychology and nursing) would likely notbe gained within the psychology department, but would be fulfilled bystudents engaging in interdisciplinary education by taking such coursesin other departments of the university. The model, therefore, is one ofinterdisciplinarity at the graduate psychology level, with advanced cross-training and education in another field following completion of thegraduate psychology degree. At the completion of such an interdis-ciplinary and cross-training program, many graduates would hold dualdegrees, such as a masters or Ph.D. in psychology and a nursing degreeor masters in business administration. All graduates, though, with orwithout dual degrees, would have achieved an extensive interdisciplinarygraduate education, with hybrid skills and advanced knowledge of morethan one field. HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 147 SIX HYBRID PATHS FOR THE EDUCATION OF CLINICALPSYCHOLOGISTSPsychology and Nursing/Allied Health ProfessionsAllied health professions have traditionally been all of those in whichthe clinicians assist, facilitate, or complement the work of physicians. Inthe past, such professions typically included nursing, physical therapy,occupational therapy, speech language pathology, audiology, physiciansassistants, and others. The focus here is on nursing, occupational therapy(OT), and physical therapy (PT), though conceivably many of thedisciplines comprising allied health could provide opportunities forinterdisciplinary education and cross-training of clinical psychologists.The current growing independence of many of these allied healthprofessions from physician dominance is now resulting in a need toreconsider the term \"allied health\" entirely. Advanced practice nurses(APNs), for example, are gaining independent prescription privileges onpar with medical personnel (Segal-Isaacson, 1998), and OTs and PTs areactively ad- dressing how to monitor and manage their own clinicaltreatment hierarchies over which they have significant control (Holland,1998). The former College of Health Related Professions at theUniversity of Florida in Gainesville changed its designation to theCollege of Health Professions in 1995 to more accurately reflect the roleof disciplines such as OT, PT, and SLP (\"Changing Name\", 1995). Whatfollows are specific definitions and descriptions of the three healthprofessions proposed here for cross-training psychologists: nursing, OT,and PT.NursingThere are multiple levels of nurses. The Registered Nurse (RN) is therecognized standard of practice and the RN constitutes the most commoneducationallevelfor nursing. There are generally four routes tobecoming an RN: 1) a diploma program offered directly through ahospital (approximately two to three years following high school); 2) anassociates degree through a junior college ( a two year associates degreefollowing high school); 3) a baccalaureate nursing degree through a fouryear college or university program which frequently results in either abachelors degree in nursing (BN) or both a non-nursing bachelors degreeaccompanied with a nursing diploma; and 4) a pre-nursing backgroundwithin a baccalaureate program followed by a post-baccalaureate diplo-ma program or two year RN program.Education beyond the RN or BN degree, usually a masters degree,frequently results in one of four types of advanced practice nurse (APN):nurse practitioner (NP), clinical nurse specialist (CNS), nurse midwife(NM),and nurse anesthetist (NA; Pearson, 1999). While the four types 148NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY of advanced practice nurses frequently differ with regard to practicespecialties, practice settings, and emphases, what they share, in additionto a foundation in the nursing philosophy, is rapid advancement andgrowing influence in the contemporary health care environment despitethe reticence and objections of organized physicians' groups (Cooper,Laud, & Dietrick, 1998).Occupational TherapyOccupational therapists work to restore the highest possible level ofindependence of those individuals limited by physical injury, illness,cognitive impairment, psychosocial function,or developmental orlearning disability (Neistadt & Crepeau, 1998, p. 897). Occupationaltherapy does not focus exclusively on physical function or rehabilitation,but ratherthe development of whole activitiesof dailyliving.Occupational therapists, therefore, address the physical and cognitiveaspects of recovery or adjustment.Occupational therapists are educated at either the bachelors or masterslevel. Occupational therapy is recognized as a crucial discipline withinmedical and rehabilitation settings, though it is often not well understoodby the public. Occupational therapy is rapidly moving into areas ofclinical treatment and program administration that significantly impactand overlap with clinical psychology in medical and mental healthsettings.Physical TherapyPhysical therapists (PTs) evaluate and treat the physical capacitiesand limitations of individuals with illness or injury (Neistadt & Crepeau,1998, p. 793). Physical therapists are often primarily focused on patients'ability to increase strength, balance, and mobility (APTA, 1995). UnlikeOT, PT tends to focus more on physical functioning and recovery ratherthan broad activities of daily living.The Benefits to Psychologists of Cross-Training in Nursing/AlliedHealth ProfessionsThe mutually beneficial alliance between the fields of psychology andnursing has been emphasized in the past (DeLeon, Kjervik, et al, 1985),and the advantages of being cross-trained in clinical health psychologyand nursing have been outlined (Thomas, 1996). Increasingly, greaterresponsibility for patient care is being given to RNs and APNs in hospitaland clinic settings in order to reduce health care costs (Brink, 1999). Theresult is higher profiles and greater potential clout for the nursing fieldwithin managed care settings. HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 149 Median starting salaries for some APNs now frequently exceed thatfor clinical psychologists in many markets (Fisher 1997, p. 481). NPshave been particularly successful in lobbying for prescription privilegesin a large number of states (Sharp, 1999). Clinical psychologists educatedin and holding a license as an NP would likely be in an optimal positionto assume highly sophisticated and dynamic positions in a wide varietyof clinical settings. Additionally, the National Institute for NursingResearch (NINR), within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), isalready conducting some areas of research focusing on psychologicalvariables (Sheridan, 1999). Cross-trained clinical psychologist-nurseswould be well positioned to contribute to and lead such empirical effortsin a wide variety of health care and research settings.While the health professions of occupational therapy and physicaltherapy have recently suffered constricting job markets and slowedemploymentandfinancialgrowthduetoreformedMedicarereimbursement associated with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997(Schaffer, 1998), future projections for these fields are very positive(U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1998, p. 194).The United States demographic composition is a harbinger of heightenedneed for such rehabilitation and geriatric care professionals in the future(VandenBos & DeLeon, 1998, p. 19). Clinical psychologists cross-trained in one of these other health care fields would be particularly wellsuited for clinical-administrative roles and team leadership in inter-disciplinary rehabilitation settings. Clinical psychologists possessinghybrid skills and dual licenses would also have the advantage ofexpanded employment opportunities and versatility in a volatile healthcare job market.The fields of clinical psychology must begin to consider that currentneeds in health care might best be served by advanced, cross-trainedprofessionals with multiple clinical capabilities. Psychologists, in orderto continue developing influence in health care settings, will need toincorporate a much broader repertoire of clinical skills and functions(Holland, 1998; Troy & Shueman, 1996,p.67).Ideally,clinicalpsychologists in medical settings will begin receiving education in theclinical knowledge and skills of other successful health care disciplines,achieving a more holistic function as providers. The psychologist-nursepractitioner, psychologist-OT, or psychologist-PT, for example, would bein a posi- tion to 1) address both physical and psychological needs in anintegrated manner; 2) take advantage of career opportunities in eitherprofession; and 3) conduct particularly sophisticated interdisciplinaryresearch.Clinical psychology need not wait only for legislation that will allowfor prescription privileges for psychologists in order to expand their 150NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY health care role. Multiple opportunities for expansion of clinical healthcare abilities are currently available for those psychologists willing andable to pursue post-graduate education in one of the closely related, butindependent, health professions. Furthermore, as noted above, somehealth professions, like nurse practitioners, have already gained pre-scription privileges.Interdisciplinary education that allows students tosubsequently pursue post-graduate training in one of the allied healthfields may facilitate psychologists gaining prescription privileges throughthe legislative progress made by the other profession.Frequent Prerequisites for Nursing/ Allied Health ProfessionsProgramsEach of the health fields reviewed above has its own set ofprerequisites or recommended courses prior to advanced study. Some ofthe health professions, such as Advanced Practice Nursing, have pre-requisites that would necessitate a great deal of navigation in order tointegrate them into a graduate clinical psychology curriculum. In the caseof any of the Advanced Practice Nursing specialties, for example, onemust already possess an RN degree in order to pursue a masters degree.The interdisciplinary preparation in a graduate psychology programwould ideally involve course work and clinical rotations that would resultin an RN degree as well as a masters or Ph.D. in clinical psychology.Graduates of such an interdisciplinary psychology-nursing programcould subsequently go on to pursue advanced study in nursing resultingin Advanced Practice Nursing status and the contemporary liberties thatcome with it.Fulfilling the prerequisites for advanced study of OT or PT wouldlikely be less strategically challenging than for nursing, since thetraditional graduate curriculum in clinical psychology often significantlyoverlaps with common prerequisites for advanced study of OT and PT.For OT, many graduate programs require both social science and naturalscience didactic background. Common social science prerequisites in-clude Abnormal Psychology, Developmental Psychology, and Sociology.Natural Science prerequisites include Physiology, General Anatomy,Physics, Chemistry, Introductory Statistics, and computer literacy.Common PT prerequisites include those listed above for OT, but withfrequent additional prerequisites of microbiology and exercise phys-iology. Many PT programs do not emphasize a substantial social sciencebackground that most OT programs prefer.Psychology and Complementary and Alternative HealthComplementary and alternative health (CAH) refers to a range of healingand wellness methods that complement conventional biomedicine and HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 151 broaden health care options (Berger, Hawley, & Pincus, 1992). ManyCAH practices have been drawn from traditional Eastern systems ofhealth (such asIndian Ayurvedic approaches tohealth,Chinesemedicine, and Tibetan medicine) and native Western approaches tohealth (such as Native American healing practices). CAH tends to havethree broad areas of focus: biophysical modalities (e.g. acupuncture,Alexander Technique, massage, subtle energy, yoga, meditation, qiqong)biochemical modalities(e.g.herbs, nutrition, and some aspects ofacupuncture) (Wu, Bandilla, Ciccone, Yang, Cheng, Carner, Wu, &Shen, 1999), and spiritual practices (e.g. meditation, yoga, prayer,pilgrimage). The emphasis of most complementary and alternative healthis holistic, so there is a great deal of intentional integration and overlapamong these three broad modality domains.The Benefits to Psychologists of Cross-Training in Complementaryand Alternative (CAH) Nor lock,Calkins, & Delbanco,1993;Rosellini, 1999).The Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) of theNational Institutes of Health (NIH) was recently elevated to a free-standing center within the NIH (Muscat, 1999). Now called the NationalCenter for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), thecenter is now able to fund its own research grants independent of otherNIH institutes or centers (Muscat, 1999). Over the past five years, newempirical peer-reviewed journals, such as Alternative Therapies in HealthandMedicine,focusingexclusivelyon CAH,haveemerged.International, interdisciplinary conferences in topics like traditionalEastern medicine have also begun to take place.CAH may represent one of the most promising interdisciplinary andcross-training opportunities for contemporary clinical psychologists,thoughlittlehas been proposed regarding how psychology mightinterface with CAH in terms of educational preparation or practice. CAHis projected to continue to grow rapidly (Boucher & Lenz, 1998) andcertain practices within CAH like massage therapy (Thomas, 1999),acupuncture, and naturopathic medicine (Cassileth, 1998, p. 52) areincreasingly being incorporated intomainstream Western medicalpractice. A number of medical schools have begun to incorporate CAHinto the curriculum (Rosellini, 1999). While clinical psychology andother non-physician health care professionals have experienced resistancefrom the American medical establishment with regards to prescriptionprivileges and other avenues for growth (Klusman, 1998; Starr, 1982, p.27), such resistance does not exist in areas of complementary and 152NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY alternative health.In fact, a number of CAH leaders have called forincreased collaborationwith and inclusion of clinical psychology(Horrigan, 1998; Menkin, 1999). It is also worth noting that, at a timewhen psychologyisexperiencing increaseddifficultywith reim-bursement for clinical services, CAH is slowly beginning to experienceincreased coverage and inclusion (Goleman & Gurin, 1993, p. 17;Cassileth, 1998, p.52). Since many principles and practices beingattributed to CAH are, in fact, traditional psychological concepts andmethods (relaxation training, meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, etc.), theopportunity for clinical psychologists to contribute to and benefit frominvolvement in the fields comprising CAH is already evident. SomeCAH practices have been criticized on the grounds that they lackempirical support (McCutcheon, 1994; 1995) or have not yet beensubjected to randomized clinical trials (Angell & Kassirer, 1998).Clinical psychologists cross-trained in CAH could bring research skillsand a demanding empirical perspective to CAH that could helpstrengthen the field. As health care professionals, it could be said thatpsychologistsareobligatedto become more involvedin CAH,particularly given the public's growing pursuit of services subsumedunder this designation, and the need for empirical influence. It is notablethat the public has been very vocal in its pursuit of CAH and hasadvocated for the inclusion of CAH in health maintenance organizations(HMOs) and insurance coverage (Moore, 1997). The field of clinicalpsychology, by becoming more closely involved with CAH, may be ableto better identify and incorporate those qualities possessed by CAH andits practitioners that have resulted in such strong public appeal.Frequent Prerequisites For Complementary and Alternative HealthProgramsThe array of complementary and alternative health practices is sobroad that identifying prerequisites for entry into educational or trainingprogramsissomewhat arbitrary,particularlysince some trainingopportunities in modalities like meditation or yoga are not academic anddo not have prerequisites. There are a number of formal educationalopportunities in complementary and alternative medicine, however, thatdo have specific course requirements. A large number of free standinginstitutes of acupuncture and oriental medicine offer degree or certificateprograms in oriental medicine or acupuncture. Many such programs havea small number of prerequisites highly relevant to graduate education inCAH. Even when training programs do not impose specific academicprerequisites, knowledge of human biology, anatomy, and physiologywould clearly provide useful foundation knowledge before entering anyrigorous training program in holistic health, particularly since such HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 153 training programs are not likely to be remedial and may assume suchbackground knowledge. Therefore, clinical psychologists pursuing CAHcross-training opportunities that do not have prerequisite academiccourses couldstillclearlybenefit from interdisciplinary graduatepsychology education that incorporates the courses listed below. Thesecourses are drawn from some of the most common prerequisites orsuggested courses for programs in Oriental Medicine and complementaryhealth(AmericanAssociationofOrientalMedicine,1998)andNaturopathicMedicine:Anatomy Spirituality; and Public HealthPublic health is a social institution, a discipline, and a practice(Millbank Memorial Fund Commission as cited in Last, 1995, p. 134).Public health involves community-centered endeavors, the goals ofwhich are to protect the community against threats to itshealth(Fairbanks & Wiese, 1998, p. 5). The discipline of public health, like theconcept of health itself, has evolved towards a \"process\" definition(Fairbanks & Wiese, 1998, p. 4), involving efforts across health care,science, and socialsciencedisciplines, government agencies, andnationalboundaries. The most common setting for publichealthprofessionals is still in government agencies, though the need for publichealth knowledge in managed health systems and community preventionprograms is well known (Fairbanks & Wiese, 1998, p. 28).The Benefits to Psychologists of Cross-Training in Public HealthA decade ago, it was noted that there were few clinical psychologistsworking on macro-level public health issues (Winett, King, & Altman,1989, p. 5). The rapid growth of clinical health psychology (Belar, 1997;Sheridan, 1999), however, has resulted in a great deal of overlap betweenpublichealthandthedisciplineof psychology.Clinicalhealthpsychology is often closely allied to the field of public health in itsmission (Koop,1983), and thescientific knowledge base deemedimportant to clinical health psychology overlaps much of what is centralto the field of public health (Sarafino, 1998, p. 19).A number of proponents forthespecialtyof clinicalhealthpsychology have advocated for interdisciplinary education in bothpsychology and public health (Winett, King, & Altman, 1989, p. 26).Given the current clinical and financial incentives for prevention in thecontemporary managed health care environment, an interdisciplinarybackground in these two areas would fill a growing need (Lasker & TheCommittee on Medicine and Public Health, 1997, p. 44). There are a 154NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY number of dual degree MA/MPH or Ph.D./MPH programs available,uniting psychology and public health; the potential to join the twodisciplines, however, has yet to be fully realized.There is a growing call for the expansion of public health knowledgeand application worldwide (World Bank, 1993, chap. 7). This knowledgeand these skills are likely attainable by clinical psychologists withoutadditional formal public health didactics or an additional degree program,though formalized education such as that in an MPH degree programwould likely provide the greatest professional validity and recognitionfor those psychologists who wish to pursue public health endeavors.Furthermore, as a health profession, clinical psychology has not pursuedinternational service the way the fields of medicine, nursing, and,particularly, public health have. The clinical psychologist-public healthprofessional could more readily enter into causes like international healththat might not be as accessible to a traditionally educated clinicalpsychologist.Professional success will be achieved by those who possess valuableknowledge and combinations of skills that are in greater demand thansupply. Those who unite knowledge of both clinical psychology andpublic health, similar to physicians who have sought public healthknowledge, will likely represent valued and unique professionals able toaddress health concerns, policy, and prevention efforts in ways otherscannot (Lasker & The Committee on Medicine and Public Health, 1997,p. 36).Frequent Prerequisites for Graduate Study in Public HealthMany graduate programs in public health prefer that applicants havea background in both natural sciences and social sciences, consistent withthe discipline's focus upon both the biological and social factorsunderlying health risks. Natural science courses including biology,physiology, and microbiology; and social science courses includingsociology, anthropology, and economics, in addition to psychology, arefrequently identified as providing important background knowledge forthe graduate study of public health.Psychology and Administration/ManagementPeter Drucker (1990) claims the job of a good leader is not simply tocapitalize on charisma, but to formulate problems and organize others inthe pursuit of a mission, and to rally and lead others in the pursuit of welldefined goals (p. 3). The most important skills needed for administrationor management are often debated, but there are some core skills andfundamental areas of knowledge that consensus suggests do, in fact,inform administrative functions. These areas of knowledge and skill HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 155 frequentlyinvolveunderstandingpersonnelissues,organizationalbehavior,finance,operations,organizationalstrategy,accounting,quantitative analysis, and marketing (Silbiger, 1993,p. 5). Some of theseskills are closely associated with those learned in clinical programs(personnel issues, for example), while others are further afield (e.g.accounting).Itis, however, such partially overlapping professionaldomains that may offer some of the most promising hybrid careeropportunities and are the focus here.The Benefits to Psychologists of Cross-Training in Administrative/Management SkillsAdministrative and management skills are not currently a corecomponent of the graduate psychology curriculum in most clinicalprograms (Cox, 1997; Maddi, 1997), though a number of authors in anumber of health care fields have emphasized that clinicians couldbenefit significantly from greater exposure to such skills, preparing forpositions as clinician-managers in a variety of settings (Cordes, Rea, Rea,& Vuturo, 1996; Holland, 1998). A survey of psychiatrists found thatthose in health care administrative positions reported performing agreater variety of tasks and experiencing greater job satisfaction thanstaff psychiatrists (Ranz & Stueve, 1998). Learning such administrativeand management skills can be accomplished in a number of differentways and through a number of different disciplines. Exposure to I/Opsychology at the graduate level is one of the most efficient and readilyachieved means of gaining such skills for most clinical psychologystudents in departments that also offer an I/O specialty. Business school,public administration programs, and health management programs withinschools of public health also offer opportunities for the graduate or post-graduate clinical psychologist looking to cross-train in administrativeskills. The hybrid clinical psychologist-manager would conceivably havetwo career paths from which to choose: one would constitute enteringtraditional health or mental health settings as an administrator who alsopossessesfirst hand knowledge of clinical service provision;thealternative would be to pursue a career outside traditional clinical settingsentirely, in an area such as corporate management or consulting, where aclinical background and knowledge of psychology would broadly informone's work activities, but not determine one's primary professionalidentity.Theprofessionaleducatedinbothclinicalpsychologyand management would be in a position to manage both the financialchallenges of an organization and personnel challenges in a highlysophisticatedmanner.GiventheprofessionalsuccessofI/Opsychologists (Erffmeyer & Mendel, 1990; Schippman, Hawthorne, 156NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Schmitt, 1992) clinical psychology could likely gain significantly byintegrating management skills into the graduate curriculum and preparingsome students for post-graduate pursuit of management degrees.Frequent Prerequisites for Administrative/Management ProgramsThere are a number of different genres of graduate administration andmanagement education, each with its own emphasis and, as a result, itsown set of common prerequisites or suggested background knowledge.Many administration and management programs do not have specificcourse prerequisitesforadmission,but clearly some backgroundknowledge would be advisable, if for no other reason than to orient thestudenttothekind of management program she might prefer.Administrative skills gained through a masters of public health (MPH),for example, arelikelyto be those needed forhealthservicesmanagement, relief organizations, or Federal healthagencies, andwarrant background in the biological and quantitative sciences that arelikely already fulfilled through the curriculum of most traditional clinicalprograms. Administrative skills gained through a masters of businessadministration (MBA) program, on the other hand, are likely to have acorporate emphasis, a greater focus on finance and e-commerce, andrequire competencies in areas like accounting and budgeting that are notcommon contentinmost clinicalprograms. For those pursuingadministrative and management skills through post-graduate study inmasters of public administration (MPA) programs, which are primarilyconcerned with leadership in the non-profit sector (McCormick, 1994, p.1), background coursework in accounting, finance, government policy,and legislativeprocess might prove helpful. Below are commonprerequisites for graduate programs in business administration and publicadministration.Although many schools of public health also provideprograms in health management, prerequisites for entry into public healthprograms have been covered above.There are an enormous number of MBA programs and no universalset of academic prerequisites. Some programs, however, do either requireor strongly favor applicants with two to three years of work experience.Some of the additional common academic prerequisites or suggestedcompetencies include: College Algebra, Integral and Dif- ferentialCalculus,and Basic Accounting.Since MBA programs tend toemphasize economics, finance, accounting, and marketing (in addition tostatistics and organizational behavior which most psychology graduatestudents would know well), students possessing familiarity with some orallof these areas would make a ready transition into a businesscurriculum. Furthermore, some business schools offer accelerated degreeprograms for incoming students possessing significant backgroundT.6 0 HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 157 coursework in business.Graduate clinical psychology programs couldreadily integrate business school prep courses intothetraditionalcurriculum, and some programs could likely achieve a dual degreeprogram in clinical psychology and business that would significantlyenhance the career options of graduates.MPA programs offer education for the management and ad-ministration of public and non-profit programs (McCormick, 1994, p. 1).They therefore tend to emphasize knowledge of the social sciences, muchof which a graduate program in psychology islikelytosatisfy.Suggested, though frequently not required, background courses foradmissiontograduatepublicadministrationprogramsinclude:Economics, Anthropology, Political Science, and Statistics.Psychology and Information TechnologyInformation technology is a term that refers to a broad spectrum offunctions and applications, ranging from record-keeping activities to theinteraction of human factors with computers. In the most practical sense,information technologyreferstocomputer applications aimed atcapturing, transmitting, and recording information for use by an entireorganization (Griffith, 1995, p. 418). Information systems are oftennetworked in complex ways, and this complexity requires specializedknowledge and skills in order to engineer, organize, and integrate thesesystems within organizations. For example, an integrated system ofinformation in a health care setting might involve combining patientaccounting and medical records (Griffith, 1995, p. 419), two distinctfunctional units that must continuously share information. Those whoengineer andconstructtheseintegratednetworksof informationconstitute critical resources within an organization dependent upon suchcoordinated processes.The interaction of human factors with computer science is alsosubsumed under information technology and incorporates a great deal ofpsychological and cognitive principles along with those of informationtechnology.Similar to the way in which ergonomics addresses thephysical relationships between people and machines (Barlow, 1990, p.59; Quick, 1999), parallel concerns now focus on the interaction betweenhuman cognitive factors and computer technology. This domain ofinformationtechnologyisinterdisciplinaryinnature,frequentlyconcerned with identifying the most productive and \"user friendly\"applications of technology, and offers promising opportunities forstudents with advanced knowledge of clinical psychology. 158NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The Benefits to Psychologists of Cross-Training in InformationTechnologyThere is an increasing need for clinical psychologists to become moreengaged with technology and computer science (Berry, 1996). Whileother specialties within psychology have sought further collaborationwith technological fields and computer science, giving rise to new andinnovative hybrid disciplines, clinical psychology has remained lesstechnologically invested. The area of artificial intelligence, for example,is a discipline entrenched in both cognitive psychology and technology(Wagman, 1998, p.12), though the contribution of applied clinicalknowledge to this area has yet to receive full attention. Nevertheless, theinvolvement and productivity of other fields of psychology in technologyand computer science suggests promising opportunities for clinicalpsychologists as well.The School of Information at the University ofMichigan,for example, has aspecializationin Human-ComputerInteraction which specifically emphasizes organization theory andbehavioral science along with computer science, and a number of facultyin this specialization have backgrounds in cognitive psychology. Anumber of other universities have programs in information technologyand computer science that are highly accessible for interdisciplinaryeducation. The University of Arkansas at Little Rock is in the process ofdeveloping a new College of InformationScience and SystemsEngineering that, in addition to an academic major, will offer anacademic minor in information systems and will encourage students witha variety of career interests to adopt this minor.Clearly, the potential for psychology in general to contribute to thefield of information technology has begun to be realized. The opportunityfor clinical psychology specifically to become involved also seems verypromising. For example, graduates with a knowledge of both behavioralhealth and information technology would be well positioned to helpdesign or maintain management information systems (MIS) in managedcareorhealthinsurancesettings.Unified knowledge of clinicalpsychology and information technology would also result in hybridprofessionals capable of designing distance learning methods andcomputer software that educates the public, students, or professionals inmatters related to behavioral health. Psychologists at the MissouriInstitute of Mental Health, for example, designed an educational softwareprogram that introduces the lay public to mental health and behavioralhealth concepts in a very accessible and user-friendly format (Epstein,Sage, & Wedding, 1995).Furthermore, clinical psychology graduateswho are crossed-trained ininformation technology might be bestpositioned to help design and influence the production of computer-basedapproachestopsychologicalassessment andtreatment,including HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 159 telehealth reports.Frequent PrerequisitesforGraduate or Advanced Study ofInformation SystemsPrograms of study in information technology are frequently free ofuniform prerequisites, though background experience or course work insome areas is advised. For example, the graduate degree program in theSchool of Information at the University of Michigan does not have strictprerequisites, but reviews applicants on a case-by-case basis for fit withthe goals and demands of the program. A clinical psychology studentapplying to the program would be considered most competitive if he had:1) a psychology background that included cognitive courses; 2) afoundation in technology, preferably with some programming ex-perience; and 3) an interdisciplinary background that might includeanthropology, economics, library or information science, architecture,sociology,engineering,and/ormathematics(G.Furnas,personalcommunication, March 30, 1999). Furthermore, a formal degree programin Information Technology may not be necessary for many psychologygraduate students wishing to unite clinical psychology with InformationTechnology skills, though a very strong foundation of knowledge intechnology, however acquired, is critical.Psychology and Public PolicyPublic policy is ultimately that for which the government exists.(Davidson & Oleszek, 1998, p. 349). It is what the government says anddoes about perceived problems (Ripley & Franklin, 1991, p. 12). Publicpolicies may be explicit, authoritative statements of what the governmentis doing about a specific issue, written down in the form of laws or rules(e.g. financing social security or naming a federal building); or they maybe far less formal (e.g. a stated mission in the President's State of theUnion Address) (Davidson & Oleszek, 1998, p. 350). Policies mayemphasize substance (e.g. building the defense system or highwayinfrastructure) or procedure (e.g.mandating program managementstandards) (Davidson & Oleszek, 1998, p. 350). Policies emerge througha Darwinian-like process of selection, determined by a host of factors andinputs. Understanding the complex process of policy formation can bedifficult, but such an understanding is imperative for professionalpsychologists, if they are to successfully contribute to the shaping ofmajor policy decisions. X63 -14 160NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The Benefits to Psychologists of Cross-Training in Public PolicyProfessional psychology has a long history of interest in social issuesand public policy. Social psychology and community psychology arefields that clearly represent this investment. In 1969 the theme of theAPA Annual Convention was \"Psychology and the Problems of Society\"(Korten, Cook, & Lacey, 1970, p. xi). Despite this consistent interest,however, few clinical psychologists have been actively involved inpolicy making (DeLeon, 1988). It has been stated with increasingurgency that psychologists must begin to realize the role they can have inthe process of making public policy if they are to influence legislationand political actions (DeLeon, 1988; Lee, DeLeon, Wedding, & Nordal,1994).One way to foster greater involvement of clinical psychologists in thepublic policy sphere is to encourage interdisciplinary education at thegraduate or post-graduate level that specifically emphasizes publicpolicy, government, and the legislative process. Graduate programs inclinical psychology have not typically encouraged development of highlevel public service professionals (DeLeon, 1988). Partially correctingfor this situation, since 1974 the APA has promoted and financed acongressional fellowship program in order to facilitate the involvementof psychologists in the legislative and policy-making process (Lee et al,1994), which provides an opportunity for psychologists to interface withthe political world. This APA fellowship program is small, however, andonly a handful of applicants are chosen for the opportunity each year. Atthis critical point in the development of the profession, when policymakers are directly influencing the day-to-day functions and livelihoodsof clinical psychologists through decisions affecting health care finance,mental health access, patients' rights, children's health, and healthresearch funding, the time has clearly arrived for education in clinicalpsychology to promote advanced knowledge of the legislative processand public policy on a larger scale.A number of options exist for clinical psychologists to learn a greatdeal about the legislative process and public policy. One option wouldbe the equivalent of \"executive education\" in legislative and policystudies. Such options are available through programs like that offered bythe Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, whereindividuals can earn a certificate in legislative studies by attendingintermittent weekend and week long intensives on Capitol Hill. Otheroptions include continuing education through local universities or stategovernment agencies, where courses and seminars on government policyand the legislative process are frequently open to those who areinterested. HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 161 The most intensive option would involve interdisciplinary and/orpost-graduate study of public policy, possibly resulting in dual degrees inpsychology and a masters in public policy (MPP), but more importantlyresulting in a thorough understanding of the workings and functions ofgovernment and legislation. Regardless of the specific means of gainingeducation in public policy, however, what currently remains essential isfor graduate education in clinical psychology to foster accessibility topublic policy knowledge, since without such knowledge the field as awhole will have a diminished voice on the national scale.Frequent Prerequisites for Graduate Study in Public PolicyGraduate programs in public policy, like the development of publicpolicyitself,draw from a diversecollectionof educational andprofessional backgrounds. Many masters of public policy (MPP) pro-grams prefer a history of employment or volunteer work that involvedsome aspect of policy or legislative knowledge. Most programs assumean understanding of the structure of American government and thelegislative process. Specific didactics that are frequently required orpreferred for the advanced study of public policy include micro- andmacro-economics, American history and political science, and collegealgebra or statistics.DiscussionThe proposal to begin developing hybrid career tracks for clinicalpsychologists through interdisciplinary graduate education and post-graduate cross-training is likely to generate controversy. Such a modelof graduate education necessarily requires a certain relaxation ofprofessional identity, a willingness to advocate for collections of skills,rather than membership in a profession per se, as a new approach to acareer for some graduates. This represents a radical departure from thehistorical emphasis of clinical psychology, which adopted and per-petuated a guild approach to professional identity (Kies ler, 1987, p. 57),emphasizing adherence to the specific and traditional roles of a clinician-researcher in order to maintain professional salience. Any controversyraised by the proposal to educate graduates for hybrid careers, however,would be productive at this time, since the need for dramatic change ingraduate psychology education has clearly arrived, and dialogue isneeded.If graduate study in clinical psychology continues to result only in jobchoices among traditional clinician-researcher roles, clinical psychologyprograms will lose talented students to other graduate disciplines andprofessional programs that promise graduates clear career trajectories.The jobmarketfortraditionallyeducatedandtrainedclinical 162NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY psychologists is no longer a selling point for the discipline. Whatgraduate education in clinical psychology must now do is redesigngraduate programs so that students can continue to gain the knowledgeand skills of the discipline, but have career opportunities than transcendthe traditional professional boundaries.While debate and argument are healthy for any large profession, thereis at this time a significant amount of divisiveness within clinicalpsychology.This divisiveness is largely a result of an oversupply oftraditionally educatedclinical psychologistsina limitedscientist-practitioner job market. The oversupply of clinical psychologists resultsin a reduction of professional and personal rewards due to competitionfor shrinking resources (Robiner, 1991; Wiggins, 1994). As a result ofthis unfavorable supply/demand ratio, members of the profession areengaging in turf battles over traditional practice areas, attempting toclaim certain clinical activities or clinical populations for subspecialtiesdesignated by board certification (e.g. Malec, 1992). Subspecializationwill not provide an antidote to diminishing professional resources.Factionalism is a frequent response within an organization or professionwhen the environment within which the organization functions suddenlychanges (Balser, 1997). It is a response that must be met with increasedleadership, communication among the splintering groups, and a re-focusing upon a unified mission.In order for new models of education, practice, and theory in clinicalpsychology to develop and thrive, new leaders in the field will need to beactively fostered. The profession of psychology tends to recycle itsleadership, with a small number of individuals repeatedly garnering thedecision-making and policy-making positions (Cummings, 1996, p. 7).New leadership is not visibly fostered. This may be due to the lack of acareer ladder in psychology (Sheridan, 1999). Political advancementwithin the bureaucracy of the profession is one of the few clearlyoutlined means of professional advancement, a situation that couldcontribute to a recycling of leaders and bottlenecking of new ideas. Theprofession's leadership must begin to actively promote and developupcoming generations of innovators if new ideas are to be heard andtried. Without such encouragement of a larger number of new leaders, thepace of change within the profession will continue to stagnate. Oneadvantage of developing hybrid professionals is that they can bring backto psychology successful ideas and professional strategies learned fromother professional affiliations, possibly resulting in a very diversified andbroad leadership.The interdisciplinary and cross-training model of developing clinicalpsychology graduates capable of hybrid careers may be particularly wellsuited for terminal masters programs in psychology. The masters level HollandINTERDISCIPLINARITY 163 clinical psychologist has been virtually disowned by most national andmany state psychological associations (Kohout, 1993). Masters levelpsychology graduates have little to gain from exclusive adherence to, andidentification with, traditional clinical roles within the profession. Themasters level psychology graduate who is well prepared to pursue othercareerpaths,however,willbeabletobenefitfrom advancedpsychological knowledge and skills, free from the constraints of aprofession in which he has little control. In fact, terminal masters levelprograms in psychology, because they have less regulated curriculumrequirements, may be able to adapt their curricula more rapidly tofacilitate interdisciplinary programs.The robust achievements of the discipline of clinical psychology mustbe preserved. One way to do this is to allow the discipline to be appliedin innovative ways and in new professional settings. By creating hybridprofessionals with expanded career opportunities, graduate education inclinical psychology will achieve a new model of professional preparationthat is consistent with the needs of the contemporary job market. It is theultimate act of \"giving psychology away\" (Miller, 1969). By creatingemployable graduates, psychology will be able to retain its claim as ahelping profession, since adaptation will have been made for the benefitof those students who entrust a significant portion of their time andresources to study the discipline. By educating students to addressdiverse problems, rather than adhere to a profession or \"guild\" (Kies ler,1987, p. 47), professional clinical psychology will actually prevail, sinceeducation in psychology will have conquered the limits imposed byacademic disciplines and professional borders in order to serve thebroader community.REFERENCESAmerican Association of Oriental Medicine (1998).

Book Review: Guiding Your Child through GriefRoss RobakPace UniversityAsschoolpsychologists,we'reoccasionallyconfrontedwithchildren's reactions to a death in the family. Sometimes these losses areunrecognized. Our broad American culture disenfranchises grief re-sponses of many kinds. One commonly unrecognized grief reaction isfollowing the death of a family member such as a grandparent, or anaunt/uncle. At other times, as with the death of a parent or sibling, theloss is more clearly impacting. But even in such cases, many of us find itvery difficult to know how to respond, what to suggest, or what to do tohelp the child and the family in grief. This is particularly significant inlight of the well-documented fact that most young adults reportretrospectively that their first significant loss was a death in the family.Books in the death and grieving field tend to fall into one of twocategories: They are either written to a professional audience and areoften removed from everyday experiences or they are first personaccounts of survivors. In the first case, these books are often theoreticaland abstract. In the second, they are idiosyncratic and leave onewondering whether the writing wasn't simply the author's catharsis.Mary Ann and James Emswiler have combined these two genres withclear down-to-earth explanations of theory and numerous case studies,including their own personal experiences.Guiding Your Child through Grief (Bantam, ISBN 0553380257) is avery useful book. It is written mainly for the parents of children whohave lost someone to death. But, the book is also helpful to teachers,school psychologists,and counselorsworking with children.Forexample, the authors have managed (in chapter 2) to highlight theimportant literature on cognitive development and children's grieving.This includes:Before age two, lacking the requisite language skills, the child maynot conceptualize a loss. However, he or she experiences a vague senseof \"gone-ness\" based on his or her earliest recognition of parents by theirsmells, by the sounds of their voices, by the rhythms of interactions witheach parent.Between ages two and six, preschoolers' thoughts about a death tendto be marked by magical thinking (believing they have powers to havecaused the death or to reverse it through wishing or praying). In addition,Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Rostyslaw W. Robak, Psych.Dept., Pace University, 861 Bedford Rd., Pleasantville, NY 10570.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol._ 3, No. 1, 171-172.NAJP 1 'lb 172NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY they usually struggle with three concepts: non-functionality of the body,finality (irreversibility) of the death, and universality (everybody dies).Six- to nine-year-olds tend to have a better understanding of death,but it is still far from complete. They often understand that death is finalbut they may not recognize its universality (that they will die someday,too). They are often fascinated by the biological details of death, but theymay, for example, think that death is contagious.Between ten and thirteen, most children understand what \"dead\"means. However, during this period they begin to struggle with whydeath happens.Adolescents can be said to think about death, in many respects, theway that adults do. What adults need to keep in mind is that adolescentsstruggle with some of the ultimate questions: \"Why must I die?\" \"Whydo bad things happen?\" \"What is the meaning of life and of death?\"Another set of questions for the school psychology professional isrelated to the nature of the grieving process itself. Parents and teachersoften intuitively recognize that grief is a confusing experience. They arelikely to have experienced a death in their own lives, perhaps even intheir own childhood. The Emswilers have outlined five \"challenges\" thatgrieving children face. Adults can guide themselves by these challengesas they help a child through his or her grief. These challenges are:Feeling safe in the world again. For parents and teachers, this means:increasing predictability in the child's life; keeping one's own anxietiesseparate from the child's and talking with him or her about their health(and safety) concerns; helping them experience a sense of mastery inwhatever areas they can; and being present (attentive and available).Understanding the death. Parents and others can: give accurate infor-mation in a concrete manner appropriate to the child's developmentallevel; read books together; and not trying to wipe out the loss.Mourning the death. This means, essentially, talking about feelings andfacilitating other expressions of emotions (e.g., drawing, keeping adiary).Staying connected with the person who died. The often-cited ChildBereavement Study reported that 80% of bereaved children say that theyfeel as if the deceased person is watching them. It seems that childrenneed to maintain their connections with the deceased. Keeping pictures,continuing projects that had been done with the dead person, and writingabout them can serve to help children maintain their connections.Resuming childhood again. It's important to not let the grieving childlose his or her childhood. While children are facing all of the previouschallenges, they are also children and thus need to play, have friends, andbe allowed to fool around.Guiding Your Child through Grief is filled with such insights. It is anexceptionally good bibliotherapy resource. Any adult involved in the lifeof a grieving child is bound to take many lessons from it. Validity Comparison of the General AbilityMeasurefor Adults with the Wonderlic Personnel TestiJ. Patrick LeverettT. Darin MatthewsKerry S. LassiterNancy L. BellThe CitadelFuture trends with regard to workplace demographics and the predictedmulticultural expansion of the labor force are briefly reviewed, with afocus on the importance of cultural fairness in utilizing assessment incareer counseling.The present study investigated the validity of theGeneral Ability Measure for Adults (GAMA) and the WonderlicPersonnel Test (WPT) for a sample of 112college students. Resultsindicated GAMA IQ scores correlated significantly with WPT scores(r =.61, p < 0.001). Results suggest that the GAMA may provide utility inthe assessment of individuals within career counseling settings who havelimited command of English, have language difficulties (e.g., language-based learning disorders), or who possess handicaps which may limittheir ability to effectively process linguistic stimuli (i.e., deafness).Implications for clinicalpractice,as well as future research, arediscussed.A number of issues relevant to the use of psychological assessment incareer counseling should be considered by psychologists engaged in suchactivities. Intelligence exists as just one of the many issues pertinent tooccupational choice, and admittedly might not ultimately prove asimportant as motivation, discipline, or other personality variables (i.e.,ability to work and communicate with others, attitudes toward work,etc.). However, intellectual factors are generally assumed to be importantin making broad decisions and choices within the process of careercounseling. As such, assessment of the intellectual ability of clients(typicallyusedtopredict a client'spotentialfor educational oroccupationallevel)isan importantaspectof careercounseling(Lindeman & Matarazzo, 1990).With an expanding multicultural population comprised of increasingnumbers of persons with varying levels of English language proficiency,Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: J. Patrick Leverett, ofPsychology, The Citadel, 171 Moultrie St., Charleston SC 29409North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 173-182.NAJP 174NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY it is imperative that users of psychological tests consider the potentialeffects of language deficits in the testing process. In addition, the use ofinstruments that rely heavily on verbal content with persons who havelanguage-based learning disorders may adversely impact assessmentresults. This study will investigate the validity of a relatively culture-fairinstrument that makes use of minimal linguistic stimuli, specifically theGeneral Abilities Measure for Adults (GAMA; Naglieri & Bardos, 1997).The GAMA will be compared to an instrument widely used in careercounseling and occupationally-related decision making, the WonderlicPersonnel Test (WPT; Wonderlic Personnel Test, 1992).Significant changes are expected to occur in the workplace over the next fifty years as a result of changing United States populationdemographics (Futurework, 1999). Predicted trends suggest that theNorth American workforce will continue to expand and to grow morediverse (Futurework, 1999; Latham & Sue-Chan, 1997), leading to anumber of increasingly important areas of concern for psychologists andother counseling professionals who utilize psychological testing incareer-related or occupational counseling. In 1995, White Americansconstituted 73.6% of the US population. By 2050, White Americans areprojected to comprise only 52.8% of America's populace, with Black andNative American segments of the U.S. population projected to showmodest proportional population increases over this same period of time (12.0% to 13.6%, 0.7% to 0.9%, respectively). The most dramaticprojected proportional increases in population levels involve groupsspecified as \"Hispanic origin\" and \"Asian and Pacific Islander.\" origin comprised 10.2% of America's population in 1995.By 2050, Hispanic Americans are projected to constitute 24.5% of theU.S. population. The Asian and Pacific Islander group is expected to grow in that same time period from a group comprising 3.3% ofAmericans to 8.2% of the U.S. population. Nearly two-thirds of thepersons responsible for this population growth will be immigrants(Futurework, 1999).Latham and Sue-Chan (1997) suggest that a number of aspects,including validity, reliability and freedom from bias, will be emphasizedin selecting employees for the 20 century North American workplace.Among the most important of these issues are the potential dis-criminatory effects of language-based instrumentation with persons whomay be entirely suitable for certain occupational settings, but who scorepoorly on tests due to their relative inefficiency of language usage. Theissue of potential discrimination in assessing those for whom English is anon-preferred language must be addressed and adequately resolved. Thisisparticularlyimportantwhensuchapplicantsareconsidering Leverett, Matthews, Lassiter, & Bell GAMA/WONDERLIC175 occupations for which English language proficiency is not an essentialaspect of job performance.In addition to issues related to the acquisition of English language,other factors also have significant impact with regard to the appropriateuse of psychological assessment in career counseling. Individuals whohave language-based learning disorders may perform less efficiently ontests which rely heavily on linguistic stimuli. Similarly, individuals whoare deaf or who have significant hearing impairment may have limitedcommand of written language due to their use of an alternative form oflanguage (i.e., American Sign Language). These individuals may beentirely well-suited for a number of jobs, but may demonstrate poorperformance on intelligence tests that are comprised of verbal contentand that rely heavily on language skills.These points emphasize a number of issues pertinent to psychologicalassessment of clients involved in career counseling. Standards forappropriate use of psychological tests stress that psychologists considerthe cultural backgrounds and prior experiences of ethnicity, age, genderand cultural groups (Standards for Educational and PsychologicalTesting,1985).Indeed,linguistic and experiential differencesareessential elements of possible bias when traditionally American in-struments are used to assess culturally different individuals.In an attempt to address this issue, several psychological instrumentshave been translated into alternative-language formats. Simple translationis not in itself sufficient, since virtually all languages have differingexpression of concepts and phrases, unfamiliar idiomatic usage, etc.Even when reliable and valid alternative language versions of in-struments exist, it is a dilemma to understand exactly what mechanismsmay predicate the differential observed performance of majority versusminority cultures (especially those for whom English is a preferredlanguage and those for whom it is not). For example, -Helms (1992)described the inherent \"Eurocentricism\" in cognitive ability testing,pointing out how culture may influence test responses in a variety ofways. Perez-Arce (1999) described the \"cultural boundness\" of cog-nition,pointingout that language and socioeconomic factors areespecially influential in the way that an individual responds on cognitiveability testing. Making matters even more complex, the equivalence ofpsychometric properties including item content, reliability, validity, andlevel of difficulty cannot be assumed when instruments are translatedfrom onelanguagetoanother(StandardsforEducationalandPsychological Testing, 1985).The Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT) is perhaps the most widelyused instrument to assess intellectual ability in career and occupationally-related counseling and assessment settings. In addition to the original179 176NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY English language version, the WPT has been translated into 12 differentlanguages. With the exception of the Spanish language version, the otheralternative language versions of the WPT are currently considereddevelopmental due to insufficient reliability and validation research(Wonderlic, 1992). The WPT is purported to be a good measure ofgeneral intelligence, or \"g\" (Wonder lic, 1992) and has been shown innumerous studies to be correlated with the Wechsler Adult Tsuang, 1990).In addition to issues related to the appropriate use of psychologicaltests in career counseling, this study was conducted to contribute to thegrowing amount of validation research concerning the GAMA. Naglieriand Bardos (1997) have reported results from a number of studiesexamining the validity of the GAMA. These include reported significantand strong positive relationships between the GAMA IQ score and theWAIS-R (Wechsler, 1981), the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT; Kaufman & Kaufman, 1990), and the WPT (Wonderlic, 1992).Review of these studies suggests that the GAMA provides a goodestimate of general intellectual ability (Naglieri & Bardos, 1997). Inexamining the relationship between the GAMA, the WPT, and theShipley Institute of Living Scale (Shipley, 1967), Naglieri and Bardos(1997) administered these instruments to a sample of 80 individualsranging in age from 25 to 45 (M = 34.2, SD = 6.2). They found that theGAMA IQ score correlated positively with the WPT (r = .70, p<.001);significant positive correlations were also found between the GAMA andthe Shipley Vocabulary (.56), Shipley Abstraction (.73), and ShipleyTotal Scores (.72).A small number of additional validation studies have been conductedinvestigating the validity of the GAMA. Lassiter, Leverett, and Safa(2000) found that the GAMA measures nonverbal intelligence to agreater degree than it does general intelligence. They reported that thestatistically significant positive correlation between the GAMA andWAIS-R Performance IQ was itself significantly greater than thesignificant positive correlations observed between the GAMA andWAIS-R Verbal and Full Scale IQ scores. Their findings suggest thatwhile the GAMA does measure verbal aspects of intelligence and can beviewed as a measure of general intelligence, it is more clearly associatedwith nonverbal, perceptual-organizational skills.Clearly, additional research is needed to provide evidence of theGAMA's validity, both in general terms as well as its validity for specificuses (i.e., career counseling). In this study, the concurrent validity of theGAMA was investigated, using the WPT as the criterion measure. Leverett, Matthews, Lassiter, & Bell GAMA/WONDERLIC177 METHODParticipants and ProcedureStudy participants were 112 adult college students attending a smallsoutheastern college. Fifty-five women and 57 men participated Caucasian, African-American, Participants' ages rangedfrom 18to 55 years (M = 26.9, SD = 8.60). Participants wereadministered the GAMA and WPT according to the procedures describedin the respective test manuals. The WPT score was converted to a metricwith a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 by subtracting thenormative mean of 21.06 and dividing the normative standard deviationof 7.12 from each individual's score to obtain the standard score.(Wonder lic, 1992). The GAMA and WPT were part of a larger battery ofintelligence measures administered to participants.InstrumentsThe General Abilities Measure for Adults (GAMA; Naglieri &Bardos, 1997) is a paper and pencil intelligence test which measuresreasoning ability through the use of abstract geometric designs. TheGAMA takes 25 minutes to complete and is comprised of four subscales:Matching, Analogies, Sequences, and Construction. Examinees mustchoose the best response from among six alternatives. For example, onthe Matching subscale, the examinee must choose from the alternativeresponses the abstract geometric design which best matches the stimulusitem. The response chosen must match the stimulus item according tocolor, shape, and configuration.The Analogies sub-scale involves presentation of an abstract designpair which is followed by another design pair in which the last design ismissing. Examinees must study one stimulus design pair and choose themissing component which will complete the second stimulus design pairfrom a number of response alternatives. The examinee must recognizethe relationship between the design in the first design pair and then selectthe design that best perpetuates this conceptual relationship in com-pleting the second design pair.The Sequences subscale consists of geometric designs presented insequential frames. Design shapes, colors, and locations within each framechange in a logical sequence from left to right, with one frame within thesequence left blank. The examinee must recognize the pattern and choosethe design which best completes the pattern sequence.The Construction subscale requires that the examinee mentallyconfigure several disconnected shapes of differing colors in order toproduce a design. The task requires that the examinee analyze and 178NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY mentally consolidate the spatial aspects of the colored shapes in order toconstruct a design to match one of the response alternatives.The Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT; Wonderlic Personnel Test,1992) is a paper and pencil short form test of general cognitive ability.The WPT consists of 50 questions which incorporate a variety of types ofproblems. WPT questions include word comparisons, disarranged sen-tences, sentence parallelism, following directions, number comparisons,number series, geometric figure analysis, and mathematics and logicalstory problems. Items begin at a modest difficulty level, and graduallyincrease in difficulty. The WPT can be administered in groups, withexaminees given 12 minutes to see how many items they can correctlyanswer.RESULTSMeans, standarddeviations,and Pearson product-moment cor-relations for the GAMA IQ score and subscales (Matching, Analogies,Sequences, and Construction) and the WPT are presented in Table 1.TABLE 1 Means, Standard Deviations, and Correlations for = 112. aWonderlic Personnel Test Score is converted toa metric with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 by subtracting thenormative mean of 21.06 and dividing the normative standard deviation of 7.12from each individual's score to obtain the standard score. (Normative informationobtained from the Wonderlic Personnel Test and Scholastic Level Exam User'sManual, 1992).bGAMA IQ Score is expressed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.`GAMA subscale scores are expressed with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3.dCorrelation corrected for range restriction.< 0.01**R < 0.001The mean WPT Total Score and GAMA IQ score were slightly higherthan 100; this is not unexpected given that participants were all collegestudents. Pearson correlation coefficients presented in Table 1 show thatthe GAMA IQ score was significantly positively correlated with theWPT totalscore.Furthermore,the GAMA Matching, Analogies,Sequences, & Bell GAMA/WONDERLIC179 correlated for restriction ofrange (Guilford & Fruchter, 1978; see Table 1 for corrected correlations),yet demonstrated this same pattern of performance.To further investigate the validity of the GAMA, we examined thedegree to which GAMA IQ scores predict individual performance on theWPT. In most clinical settings, it is this degree of predictive capacity that is essential. We calculated the percent of absolute difference scoresbetween the GAMA and WPT. Absolute difference scores presented in Table 2 demonstrate that 41% of participant's GAMA scores were within 5 points of their WPT scores and 75% were within 10 points.Ninety percent of GAMA scores were within 15 points of participant's WPTscores. It is noteworthy that 25% of participant's GAMA scores deviated by more than 10 points from their WPT score, suggesting that GAMA IQscores may provide conflicting information when evaluated on a case-by-case basis against the WPT IQ scores.

GAMA = General Abilities Measure for Adults; WPT = Wonderlic Personnel Test.Horizontal lines reflect 5, 10, and 15 point discrepancies, respectively. DISCUSSIONOur findings suggest that the GAMA and WPT are significantlypositively correlated, and our conclusion is that the GAMA provides agood brief measure of general intellectual ability. The GAMA IQ Scoreand each of the GAMA subscales were significantly positively correlatedwith the WPT. It was noted that GAMA Sequences, Construction, andAnalogies subscales were more strongly positively correlated with theWPT than was the Matching subscale. This may suggest that while the8 3 180NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY GAMA and WPT may assess some common abilities(generalintelligence; spatial and sequential reasoning; analysis, synthesis androtation of spatial designs, and the analysis of specific figural-spatialdetails), the WPT may not assess abilities underlying the recognition ofsimilar conceptual figural relationships as strongly as the GAMA.As our nation becomes more culturally pluralistic, and as we developgreater sensitivity regarding the rights of those who may possesslinguistically-handicapping conditions to be fairly assessed and con-sidered for employment, the use of non-discriminatory assessmentprocedures becomes increasingly important. Although the WPT isperhaps the most widely used brief intelligence scale currently utilizedfor career counseling and occupationally-related decision making, a highdegree of language-based items are contained in the format of the test.Indeed, all WPT items require reading ability in order for the examinee tounderstand the instructions for completing the item, even the primarily\"figural\" items (i.e., those items requiring cognitive analysis of geometricdesigns, etc.) In addition, the majority of the WPT figural items (items 7,38, 42, 49) occur late in the format of this 50-item timed test. As such,examinees with inefficient or impaired reading ability for any of anumber of reasons may not reach many of these items within the WPT 12minute testing period. Thus, the GAMA may provide utility in the briefassessment of general intellectual ability for individuals for whomassessment with instruments utilizing primarily language-based stimulusitems would be inappropriate or undesirable.We believe that the GAMA, given in conjunction with the WPT, canprovide a valuable source of additional understanding with regard to apotential employee's intellectual ability. With regard to clients who havereduced language proficiency for any of a number of reasons alreadydiscussed, information provided by the GAMA may provide careercounselors an enhanced perspective for viewing the intellectual ability ofsuch applicants. This conclusion is supported by recent research byLassiter, Hutchinson, Bell and Matthews (1999). These researchersexamined the concurrent validity of the GAMA and the ScaleThird GAMA and WAIS-III Verbal IQ andFull Scale IQ scores. The strongest correlation in their study, similar tothe findings of Lassiter, Leverett, and Safa (2000), was between theGAMA and the Perceptual Organization Index score. A contrastingviewpoint was also noted by Matthews, Lassiter, and Habedank (1998),who explored the concurrent validity of the GAMA by comparing it tothe Shipley.They suggested that, in contrast to Naglieri and Bardo's(1997) conclusion that the GAMA is a measure of general intellectualability, that the GAMA may best assess verbal, rather than abstraction,1S4 Leverett, Matthews, Lassiter, & Bell GAMA/WONDERLIC181 skills. Perhaps more research within actual career counseling populationscan help to clarify these issues.Certain limitations of this study must be noted. This study was based upon the performance of a college student sample. While the mean GAMA IQ score and the WPT Total score of the sample were onlyslightly higher than would be expected in the normal population, futurestudies might explore the relationship of the GAMA and WPT using asample of individuals with less education. It must also be emphasizedthat suggestions regarding the potentially beneficial use of the GAMA as a measure of general intelligence with persons who have reducedlanguage proficiency are speculative; future research exploring the utility of the GAMA within such populations should be conducted. It shouldalso be noted that, ironically, given our discussion of multicultural issues,our sample was largely Caucasian (i.e., 77.7%). Future research shouldbe conducted using a more racially heterogeneous sample. REFERENCESDodrill, C. B. (1981). An economical method for the evaluation of generalintelligence in adults.

McCutcheon, editor Males' Impressions of Female Fans and Nonfans:There Really is \"Something about Mary\"Daniel L. Wann, Jennifer Schinner, Brian L. KeenanMurray State UniversityThis experiment examined male sport fans' and nonfans' impressions offemale fans. Participants with a high or low interest in sport fandom reada description of a target female presented as having a high or low interestin sport and a high or low interest in a local team. Participants thenreported their impressions of the target. As expected, males with a stronginterest in sport gave particularly positive ratings to the target describedas possessing a similarly high interest. Participants with little interest insport gave particularly high ratings to the target described as possessingboth a high interest in sport and a high interest in a local team. Theseparticipants reported less favorable impressions when the target wasdescribed as having a high interest in sport but little interest in a localteam.Historically, sport fandom has been a male dominated domain, withmany investigations finding that men are more likely to be highlyinvolved sport fans than women (for a review, see Wann, Melnick,Russell, & Pease, 2001). However, recent investigations indicate that thenumber of women sport fans and spectators is on the increase. Forinstance, the National Football League and National Hockey Leagueestimate that women now constitute roughly 45 percent of their fans(Meyers, 1997; Mihoces, 1998), while women comprise approximatelyhalf of major league soccer fans (Hofacre, 1994).With the recent increase in the number of women entering the maledominated area of sport fandom, researchers have become interested ingender differences in sport fandom as well as differential perceptions ofmale and female fans. In their work on sport fan motivation, Wann andhis colleagues have found several consistent differences in motivesexpressed by male and female fans (Wann, 1995; Wann, Schrader, &Wilson, 1999). Their research indicates that males are more likely to bemotivated by eustress (i.e., positive stress), self-esteem needs, and theaesthetic features of athletic contests. Females are more likely toparticipate in sport fandom because it provides an opportunity to spendtime with their family. Dietz-Uhler, Harrick, End, and Jacquemotte Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Daniel L. Wann, Department ofPsychology, Murray State University, Murray, KY 42071 or todanwann@msumusik.mursuky.edu via Internet.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 183-192.NAJP194 184NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY (2000) also found that female fans were more likely than males to viewthe activity as an opportunity to be with one's family.With respect to research on perceptions of male and female fans, Dietz-Uhler, End, Jacquemotte, Bentley, and Hurlbut (2000) asked undergraduates to complete a questionnaire packet assessing their level of identification with their favorite team, level of sexism, and theirperceptions of male and female fans. The results revealed that male and female fans were perceived quite differently. For instance, when asked to consider the behaviors ofa hypothetical male and female fan, theparticipants estimated that the male fan engaged in significantly more fan behaviors (e.g., watching sport on television, discussing sport, etc.) than did the female fan. Participants with a high level of team identificationand those with a high level of sexism were particularly likely to perceivedifferences in male and female fans.While the Dietz-Uhler, End, et al. (2000) work was an important step in understanding perceptions of female sport fans, these authors were simply interested in differential perceptions of fan behaviors as a function of gender. As a result, they did not examine the valence (i.e.,positivity or negativity) of males' impressions of female fans. If, as many have suggested, sport is often viewed as a male dominated activity(Blinde, Greendorfer, & Sankner, Allison, & McGeorge, 1998), what are the perceptions males possess of female fans, persons who were formerly outsiders for this activity? This questionwas the focus of the current experiment.Specifically, the current study attempted to determine if males formpredominately positive or negative impressions of females who express a high level of interest in sport. Interestingly, using both research and theory, it appears that one could build a fairly sound argument for eitherimpression. On the one hand, in light of the fact that sport has historically been a male dominated institution, it seems reasonable that male fansmay reject female fans, viewing them as interfering with their \"malebonding\" time and violating a well-established societal norm (see Wenner, 1996). This was suggested by Dietz-Uhler, End, et al. (2000, p. 95) who note that males may be threatened by female fans and that theymay respond to this threat by distancing themselves from female fans(see also Wann, in press). On the other hand, it is also plausible that male fans hold female fans in high esteem because they share an interest in their choice of pastimes. Research in social psychology reveals that attitude similarity is a powerful determinant of interpersonal attraction (Byrne, Clore, & Smeaton, 1986; Caspi, Herbener, & Ozer, 1992). Further, research investigating the relationship satisfaction of male and female fans supports the important impact of attitude similarity. For instance, Roloff and Solomon (1989) found strong positive correlations Wann, Schirmer, & Keenan FEMALE SPORT FANS 185 betweensimilarityof sportviewing preferences and relationshipsatisfaction among persons involved in romantic relationships.The purpose of the current experiment was to test the two competingpredictions. Because the research on attitude similarity was so robust(and included empirical support among fans) while the notion that malefans reject female fans was merely speculation, we hypothesized thatmales with a high interest in sport fandom would give more positiveevaluations of women described as having a similar interest than womendescribed as being less than interested in sport. Thus, a two-wayinteraction involving the participants' level of fandom (high or low) andthe female target's level of fandom (high or low) was predicted.A final variable, the female target's expressed interest in a local sportteam, was also investigated. It also seemed that, in addition to her interestin sport in general, a female's interest in a local sport team (or lack thereof) may also impact male fans' impressions of her. For instance, anindividual who was a fan in general but rejected the home team may beviewed negatively. Unfortunately, as there had yet to be any research inthis area with respect to sport fandom, the formulation of direct hy-potheses was not possible. Thus, the impact of the female target's interestin a local team was examined as a research question stating \"Does afemale's level of interest in a local sport team impact male's impressionsof her?\"METHODParticipants and designParticipants were 120 male college students participating in exchangefor extra credit in their psychology course (mean age = 22.01 years, SD =4.56). The design was a 2 (Participants' Level of Fandom: high or low) x2 (Target's Interest in Sport: high or low) x 2 (Target's Interest in theLocal Team: high or low) between-subjects factorial. Participants wererandomly assigned to the Target's Interest in Sport and Target's Interestin the Local Team conditions.Procedure and materialsUpon entering the testing session and providing their consent, therespondents were handed a questionnaire packet containing five sections.The respondents were asked to complete the first two sections and then towait for further instructions. The first section contained demographicitems requesting age and gender. The second section contained the SportFandom Questionnaire (SFQ). The SFQ contains five Likert-scale formatitems and is a reliable and valid assessment of one's identification withthe role of sport fan (Wann, in press). Response options to the questionsranged from 1 (low fandom) to 8 (high fandom). 186NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY After they had completed the first two sections, the participants weretold to read the third section but not to turn to the next page (i.e., thefourth and fifth sections). The third section contained a description of a \"fellow college student.\" The participants were instructed to read thedescription \"slowly and carefully, paying attention to each trait\" and to \"Use the description to form an impression of this person.\" Thedescription of the target person contained a list of 18 traits, such as \"Sheonce lived in Canada\" and \"She is a marketing major.\" Each trait beganwith \"She\" or \"Her\" to explicitly indicate that the target was female. There were four versions of the target description. The first 16 traitdescriptors were generic (e.g., \"a junior\", \"is blonde\", etc.) and identicalfor each of the four versions. The 17th trait manipulated the target'sinterest in sport. Subjects read either \"She has a great deal of interest insports, knows a great deal about the rules, teams, players, and stats, andwatches a great deal of sports on TV and in person\" or \"She has verylittle interest in sports, knows very few rules, teams, players, or stats, andrarely watches sports on TV or in person.\" The 18th trait manipulated thetarget's interest in their university's men's basketball team. Subjects readeither \"She has a great deal of interest in Murray State Men's Basketball,loves to support the team, wears the team's colors, and loves to watchMurray State Men's Basketball on TV and in person\" or \"She has very little interest in Murray State Men's Basketball and rarely watchesMurray State Men's Basketball on TV and in person.\" At the bottom ofthe page, the subjects read \"Do not turn to the next page until instructedto do so!\"Once all subjects had carefully read the target's description, they wereasked to turn to the last page of the questionnaire packet which containedthe final two sections. The participants were explicitly told not to turnback to previous pages while completing this page (i.e., not to refer backto the target's description). The fourth section contained four recall itemson the target'S traits, two of which were filler items and two of whichwere manipulation checks. The filler items asked the participants toindicate the target's religious affiliation and the type of vehicle she drove.The manipulation check items asked the participants to indicate whether the target had \"very little\" or \"a great deal of interest in sports and(separately) Murray State Men's Basketball (subjects were asked to circlethe correct response to the manipulation check items). The fifth section of the packet contained 6 items assessing impressions of the target.Participants indicated how friendly, nice, interesting, fun, attractive, andintelligent the target sounded from the description. Responses to theLikert-scale impression items ranged from 1 (negative impression, e.g.,not at all friendly) to 8 (positive impression, e.g., very friendly). Once thesubjects had completed the impression items, the researcher collected the Wann, Schinner, & Keenan FEMALE SPORT FANS 187 questionnaire packets. Participants were then debriefed and excused fromthe testing session. The entire procedure lasted about 20 minutes.RESULTSAll participants correctly stated the target's level of interest in sportand the local team. Consequently, all subjects were included in thefollowing analyses. The five items comprising the SFQ were combinedto form a single index of sport fandom (Cronbach's alpha = .92). Amedian split was performed on the participants' SFQ scores, resulting intwo groups: participants with a low level of fandom (n = 57, SFQ range =5 to 27) and participants with a high level of fandom (n = 63, SFQ range= 28 to 40). The six impression items were combined to form a singleindex of overall impression of the target (alpha = .84). Scores on thisindex were then divided by six to acquire scores that were consistent withthe original parameters of each impression item (i.e., scores on theimpression index could range from 1.00 to 8.00).TABLE 1 Means and SDs for Evaluations of the Female Target as aFunction of the Participant's Level of Fandom, Target's Levelof Fandom, and Target's Interest in the Local Team.

The target'sinterest in sport main effect was significant, F(1, 112) = 5.22, p < .05.The target with a high interest in sport (M = 6.34, SD = 1.15) was ratedmore positively than the target with little interest in sport (M = 5.93, SD= 0.85). The target's interest in the local team main effect was alsosignificant, F(1, 112) = 8.58, p < .01. The target with a high interest inthe local team (M = 6.39, SD = 0.79) was rated more positively than thetarget with little interest in the local team (M = 5.89, SD = 1.18). Theparticipants' level of fandom main effect was not significant.The hypothesized Participants' Level of Fandom by Target's Interestin Sport two-way interaction was significant, F(1, 112) = 7.31, p < .01.As predicted, the most positive impressions of the target person were198 188NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY reported by participants with a high interest in sport who read that the target had a similarly high interest in sport (M = 6.68, SD = 0.66). Respondents with a high degree of interest in sport gave less positiveratings to the target with little interest in sport (M = 5.83, SD = 0.93). Respondents with a low level of fandom also gave less positive evaluations of the target, both when she was described as possessing a high interest in sport (M= 5.90, SD = 1.48) and when she was presentedas having little interest in sport (M = 6.03, SD = 0.78). Post hoc tests(Newman-Keuls) indicated that the evaluations of the target with a high interest in sport reported by participants with a similarly high interestwere significantly more positive than each of the other three conditions,which did not differ from one another. The other two-way interactions were not significant.The three-way interaction was also significant, F(1, 112) = 9.82, p < .01. As seen in Table 1, participants with a low level of fandom reporteda particularly positive impression of the target with both a high interest in sport and a high interest in the local team. These persons gave par-ticularly negative evaluations to the target with a high interest in sport but little interest in the local team. Moderate evaluations were given totargets with little interest in sport. With respect to participants with a high level of fandom, positive evaluations were given to the target with ahigh level of interest in sport, regardless of whether she professed an interest in the local team. Fairly positive evaluations were also given tothe target reporting little interest in sport but a high interest in the local team. Participants with a high level of fandom gave more negativeevaluations to the target described as having little interest in both sport ingeneral and the local team.DISCUSSIONThe hypothesis that males with a high interest in sport would reportparticularly positive evaluations of a female target with a similarly highinterest was supported. Less positive evaluations were expressed by males with a high interest in sport who evaluated a female with little interest in sport as well as participants with little interest in sport (regardless of the target's interest). Thus, contrary to the suggestionsoffered elsewhere (Dietz-Uhler, End, et al., 2000), it appears that ratherthan rejecting them, male fans view female fans in a positive light. Wehave chosen to refer to this phenomenon as the \"Something About Mary\" effect, based on the popular movie released in 1998. In this film, the producer and director developed the main character, Mary, to be the \"perfect\" female. While there were many characteristics to her allure tomen (e.g., physical attractiveness, wealth, fun-loving nature), a maincomponent of her personality was her high level of interest in sport. She9 9 Wann, Schirmer, & Keenan FEMALE SPORT FANS 189 was shown actively participating in sport numerous times and explicitlyexpressed her interest in watching and following sport even morefrequently. Indeed, at one point in the film she asked a male companion,\"Hey, do you want to go upstairs and watch Sportscenter?\" The film-makers certainly knew what they were doing by portraying the \"perfect\"woman as possessing an interest in sport, at least with respect to malefans (and recall that most men are fans). The data presented aboveclearly support the \"Something About Mary\" effect as male fans in oursample formed particularly positive impressions of our \"Mary\", i.e., thefemale target described as possessing a strong interest in sport.It is important to note that although the current data contradict thesuggestions offered by Dietz-Uhler, End and their colleagues (2000), thedata described above is still compatible with those presented by thesepast researchers. For instance, recall that Dietz-Uhler, End, et al., did notassess the valence of their subjects' impressions and perceptions offemale fans.Rather, they examined whether or not the impressions ofmale and female fans differed in some way (e.g., were male fans thoughtto engage in more intense spectatorship behaviors such as sport viewing).The Dietz-Uhler, End, et al. data indicate that male and female fans areviewed differently. This finding can be integrated with the data describedabove. Specifically, it may be that male fans do view male and femalefans differently with respect to their fanship and spectatorship behaviors.However, different does not necessarily mean negative. Rather, whatappears to be occurring is that although female fans are perceiveddifferently, they still are viewed in a positive fashion.With respect to the research question on the target's interest in a localsport team, the results revealed that her interest did have an impact but,perhaps surprisingly, more so on persons with little interest in sport thanon those with a great deal of interest. With respect to those with a highlevel of interest in sport, higher evaluations were reported for the targetwith a similarly high interest in sport, regardless of her interest in thelocal team (the aforementioned \"Something About Mary\" effect). Al-though subjects with a high interest in sport also formed somewhat highimpressions of the target with little interest in sport but strong interest inthe local team, post hoc tests revealed that this effect was not significant.Thus, simply expressing an interest in a local team is not sufficient forfostering the \"Something About Mary\" effect and the correspondingpositive evaluations. Rather, the female must profess an overall interestin sport, not simply an interest in one team (i.e., a fan in general ratherthan a highly identified fan of just one team).With respect to the female's interest in a local team on impressionsformed by those with little interest in sport, two findings warrantdiscussion.First,participantswithlittleinterestinsport formed 190NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY significantly less positive impressions of the female target when she wasdescribed as having a strong interest in sport but little interest in the localteam. The rather negative evaluations of this person may have been due to this target being perceived as a \"traitor\". That is, although the participants in question had little interest in sport, many of them likely had strong emotional ties to their university. When the target was described as possessing an interest in sport yet rejected their school (i.e.,did not support the university's men's basketball team), participants with little interest in sport may have questioned the target's overall loyalty to their alma mater. This line of reasoning does have support both from research on the black sheep effect in social psychology (Marques, Yzerbyt, Leyens, 1988) and work on sport fans in general, who clearlyview \"traitors\" to a local team in a negative fashion (Branscombe, Wann,Noel, & Coleman, 1993).A second interesting finding on the target's interest in a local team on participants with little interest in sport concerns the particularly positiveevaluations these persons reported when the target was presented aspossessing both a strong interest in sport and a strong interest in a local team. Based on the previously described importance of similarity in fostering interpersonal attraction, it may have been more logical for thesepersons to have rejected the target with strong interests in sport and thelocal team because this target was dissimilar to them on this trait. Onemay be tempted to use complementarity (Winch, 1958) to explain thisphenomenon, suggesting that the males with little interest in fandomwere simply attracted to those with the complementary trait of possessinginterest in sport. However, such an explanation is inconsistent with thepreviously discussed finding that those with a high interest in sport but little interest in a local team received the least positive evaluations. An explanation based on complementarity would have required that these evaluations also be positive because this target should also have beenperceived as a compliment to the participants with low levels of fandom. Thus, we are left wondering about the underlying cause of this finding. Two possibilities present themselves. First, perhaps males with little interest in sport are attracted to women with a high interest in sport and a local team because these persons have the potential for enhancingthe male's social integration. For instance, these men may perceive some utility in dating women withan interest in sport and a local team becausethe women may be able to introduce them to social groups that they might not otherwise encounter. The fact that males with little interest insport fandom reported positive evaluations of the female only when shewas described as having a high general interest in sport and a local team is consistent with the social integration hypothesis. That is, it would certainly beeasiertoincreasesocialconnectionsthroughone's Wann, Schirmer, & Keenan FEMALE SPORT FANS 191 association with a target person if the target were interested in a locallyimportant phenomenon, in this instance, a local sport team. A female fanwho did not support the local team would provide much less of anopportunity for integration (e.g., she would not be likely to attend homegames, team rallies, etc.).Secondly, in light of the fact that most males are sport fans (Wann,Melnick, et al., 2000), male nonfans may view female fans as possessingthe ability to enhance their acceptance among male peers who are fans.The logic here is that males with little interest in sport may feeluncomfortable in some social situations, such as social gatheringspopulated by male fans. By connecting and associating with a female fan,they may be able to strategically manage their impression and, insituations where it is warranted, present themselves as a fan through theirrelationship with a female fan. Self-presentation strategies such as thisare quite common conclusion, because the current investigation was the initialexamination of the positivity and negativity of males' perceptions offemale sport fans, much remains unknown. Consequently, based on thecurrent data, a number of logical and important suggestions for futureresearch can be offered. For instance, the current study focused on thefemale target's involvement with a men's sport team. It is unclear whetherthe current data would generalize to impressions of women who identifywith women's team. Also, the current investigation focused solely onmales' impression of female fans, leaving uncertain how women viewthese targets. And finally, the current study targeted involvement with acollegiate team. Certainly, it would be important to replicate the currentfindings with fans' and targets' involvement with national and pro-fessional teams. REFERENCESBlinde, E. M., Greendorfer, S. L., & Sankner, R.

LopezUniversity of MichiganAnn ArborJ. L. Bonenberger,H. G. SchneiderAppalachian State University The association between parental discipline styles experienced duringchildhood and levels of empathy and moral reasoning during earlyadulthood was examined. One hundred and nine undergraduate collegestudents completed two self-report measures of parental discipline stylesexperienced during childhood. These measures included the BehavioralTransgression Scale (BTS) and a modified version of the Conflict TacticsScale (CTSPC). Empathy levels were measured using the QuestionnaireMeasure of Emotional Empathy (QMEE) and moral reasoning wasassessed using the Defining Issues Test (DIT). Multiple regressionanalyses were performed using discipline styles as the predictor variablesand the overall measures of moral development and empathy as thecriterions. Results indicated that gender, use of corporal punishment, andinduction were significant predictors of different levels of empathy.Females reported higher levels of emotional empathy than males.Parental use of corporal punishment and low use of induction wereassociated with low levels of empathy. Minor use of corporal punishmentwas the only significant predictor of moral reasoning. Young adults whoexperienced high levels of aggressive punishment during childhooddisplayed low levels of moral development as measured by the DIT.Parental disciplinary styles have been moderately associated with thedevelopment of empathy and moral thought in children and adolescents(Eisikovits Sagi, 1982; Pike, 1996; Larzelere, Schneider, Larson, &Pike, 1998). Most of these studies suggest that children of parents whouse inductive discipline styles (such as explaining the effect the child'smisbehavior has on others) also display high levels of norm in-ternalization and moral development. However, the relationship betweenparental use of power assertive techniques and the development ofAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. H. G. Schneider, PsychologyDept., Appalachian State U., Boone, NC 28608North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 1, 193-204.NAJP1 194NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY empathy or moral judgment is less consistent. While some researchers have been unable to find an association between power assertion and moral reasoning (Eisikovits & Sagi, 1982; Holstein, 1972), otherssuggest that power assertion strengthens the efficacy of parental use of induction in increasing norm compliance among toddlers (Larzelere,Sather, Schneider, Larson, & Pike, 1996; Larzelere, Schneider, Larson, & Pike, 1998). This suggests that power assertion may facilitate moraldevelopment. The present study attempted to explain these inconsistentfindings by refining the assessment and conceptualization of powerassertion and differentiating between aggressive and non-aggressivepower assertive techniques.Parental Disciplinary StylesMost studies divide parental disciplinary interventions into twocategories: power assertion and induction (Eisikovits & Sagi, 1982;Hoffman & Saltzstein, 1967; Rich, 1993). Power assertion is a dis-ciplinary method by which parents use their power differential with thechild to compel him/her to change his/her behavior (Hoffman, 1975).These interventions include spanking, scolding, withdrawal of privileges,and time outs. In contrast, induction refers to techniques by which theparent ensures that the child understands the consequences of his/heractions on self and others (Hoffman, 1979). These interventions includeexplaining the consequences of the behavior to the child and explainingthe rationale behind the rule. Inductive interventions may contain apower assertive component, but this component is subtle, and designed toobtain the child's attention while not eliciting a strong affective reactionfrom the child (Hoffman, 1994).Hoffman (1977) provided a theoretical basis for the role of parentaldiscipline techniques in the development of moral reasoning andempathy. He suggested that the development of moral reasoning is contingent upon the development of norm internalization, which is theability to suppress inappropriate needs and replace them with sociallyaccepted behaviors without regard for external sanctions. Childrendevelop this ability as they begin to socialize with others, and are alsoinfluenced by their disciplinary interactions with their parents. Hoffman(1994) argued that norm internalization is enhanced with the use of discipline styles that elicit an optimal level of arousal to capture thechild's attention, but provide the child with minimal external justificationfor behavior change. When complying with norms, the child is unable toattribute his/her behavior to fear of external sanctions and thus attributesitto an internalattitude change. Children who externalize normcompliance may, as adults, make decisions concerning right and wrongbased on fear of punishment or need for reward. According to Kohlberg Lopez, Bonenberger, & 'Schneider PARENTAL DISCIPLINE 195 (1976), this exemplifies lower stages of moral development. Likewise,people who do not externalize norm compliance during childhood maybe more likely to make decisions about right and wrong based oninternalized views of justice and equity, and thus have higher levels ofmoral thought.Several studies have provided evidence for this theory, suggestingthat children of parents who use mostly inductive techniques have higherinternalization of norms, more guilt over antisocial behavior, and higherlevels of empathy, altruism, and moral reasoning (Eisikovits & Sagi,1982; Hoffman, 1969, 1975a, 1975b, 1979; Hoffman & 1967;Krevans & Gibbs, 1996). However, the relationship between induction,moral thought and norm internalization appears to be more complex.Some studies indicate that the child's temperament and the child'sacceptance or rejection of the discipline technique moderate the effect ofinduction and power assertion on the development of moral thought(Grusec & Goodnow, 1994; Kochanska, 1997). Others also suggest thatthe use of induction alone is not effective, and that it is associated with avariety of negative consequences (Larzelere et al., 1996, 1998).Larzelere et al. (1998) studied the effectiveness of parental reasoningin delaying toddler misbehavior. Reasoning was most effective whencombined with punishment when the children were 2-3 years old andduring a 20-month follow- up assessment. Most importantly, childrenwhose mothers reported using reasoning without punishment had thelargest increase in disruptive behavior from 2 to 4 years of age. Larzelereet al. (1996) also found that reasoning combined with mild punishmentwas the most effective intervention in delaying toddler misbehavior whencompared with using punishment or reasoning alone. However, thecombination of non-aggressive punishment and induction was moreconsistently associated with a delay in toddler misbehavior than thecombination of aggressive punishment and induction. Although thesestudies only addressed norm compliance, it can be argued that toddlermisbehavior is related to norm internalization, and thus reasoning alonemay not be an effective method of facilitating the development of norminternalization.The findings of Larzelere et al. (1996, 1998) are consistent withHoffman's (1994) theory. Hoffman argues that parental interventionsmust produce some physiological arousal in order to gain the child'sattention, but he also indicates that parental interventions that elicit highlevels of anxiety, fear, and anger interfere with the development ofempathy, guilt and moral reasoning. Elevated levels of anxiety and fearre-direct the child's attention towards external sanctions, and mayprevent the child from understanding the impact of his/her behavior on 196NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY others. Likewise, too little arousal may result in the child ignoring theparent and disregarding the parent's inductive message. Although the level of aggression within power assertive interventionsmay play an important role in determining the influence of induction onthe development of moral reasoning and empathy, most studies have notconsidered this factor (Eisikovits & Sagi, 1982; Holstein, 1972). The purpose of this study was to analyze the possible role of parentalinduction and power assertion on the development of empathy and moralreasoning while distinguishing between aggressive and non-aggressive types of power assertion. Children's emotional reaction to highlyaggressive discipline may interfere with norm internalization even whenthese interventions are accompanied by inductive interactions. Thus, we hypothesizedthat young adults who experienced high levels ofaggressive discipline styles during childhood would have lower levels of empathy and moral development when compared to young adults who did not experience aggressive discipline interventions during childhood.It was also expected that inductive discipline, while controlling for powerassertion, would be associated with high levels of moral development and empathy.METHODDesign and ParticipantsOne hundred and two undergraduate students from a liberal arts university in the southeastern part of the United States volunteered for the study. Each of the volunteers completed a testing package consisting of four measures presented to them in a random order. Participantscompleted a consent form and were tested in small groups. The sampleconsisted of 63 females and 39 males (mean age = 19.67 years, SD = 2.01). Ninety five percent of the subjects were Caucasian (n=97). Two multiple regression analyseswere used with disciplinary styles anddemographic information as predictor variables, and empathy and moral development as the criterion variables.MeasuresMoral Development. Levels of moral judgment were measured using the Defining Issues Test (DIT; Rest, 1986). The DIT assesses the cognitive processes used during the analysis of social-moral problems.Participants are presented with a series of moral dilemmas and are asked to reach a decision concerning the most appropriate solution to eachsituation. Participants are then asked to rate a series of factors that couldhave influenced their decision. The \"P\" Index of this scale was used tomeasure Principled Morality. High scores on this index indicate a tendency to make moral decisions based on consideration of rational Lopez, Bonenberger, & Schneider PARENTAL DISCIPLINE 197 thought concerning laws and norms, such as whether these norms reflectthe general will of society and guarantee basic rights (freedom, life,happiness) toall members of society, and whether such rules arecongruent with the principles of justice and equity (Rest, 1979). The DIThas high internal consistency, with Cronbach's alphas for most sub-scalesin the high .70s (Davidson and Robbins, 1978), and moderate test-retestreliability (r = .77).Parental Discipline Styles. In order to adequately assess a broadrange of disciplinary interventions, scales were selected from twodifferent instruments measuring parental disciplinary choices. Three ofthe sub-scales from Conflict Tactics Scale (CTSPC; Straus, 1997), one ofthe most reliable tools for the assessment of domestic violence, wereused to assess levels of aggressive parental discipline. This scale is a 35-item questionnaire designed to assess the disciplinary methods offamilies and the level of aggression present within families. Thefollowingscalesfrom the CTSPC wereincluded:PsychologicalAggression (threats of violence, shouts, screams, insults, etc), MinorAssault (corporal punishment: spanking, hitting, slapping, etc.), andSevere Assault (hitting the child with objects, hitting or punching thechild on his/her face, kicking the child, etc). The CTSPC has adequatetest-retest reliability (r = .80), but has lower internal consistency becauseof the heterogeneity of the items and scales (Amato, 1991). The validityof the CTSPC has been assessed by correlating the scale with factorsassociated with corporal punishment such as age of parent, age of child,race, and gender of parent.To assess non-physicalinterventions,the Induction and Non-aggressive Power Assertion sub-scales from the Behavior TransgressionScale were used (BTS; Lopez, Dula, & Schneider, 1999). The BTSconsists of 20 hypothetical situations representing 4 types of pre-adolescent and adolescent age behavioral transgressions (aggressive andnon-aggressive safety violations, and aggressive and non-aggressivesocial violations). The items contain excellent inter-rater reliability with r> .90 (Lopez, Dula & Schneider, 1999). Examples of these transgressionsinclude \"pointing a gun at someone\" (aggressive safety violation),\"Using profanity towards a teacher\" (aggressive social violation), \"tryingto get something out of the oven without gloves\" (non-aggressive safetyviolation), and \"Leaving the refrigerator's door open\" (non-aggressivesocial violation). Subjects were presented with these items and asked tostate how likely their parents were to use different interventions whenaddressing each transgression when they were between 8 and 13 yearsold. The BTS provides scores for overall use of Induction (explaining theconsequences of his/her actions on self or others), Aggressive PowerAssertion (spanking, verbal aggression), and Non-Aggressive Power208 198NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Assertion (withdrawal of privileges, time out). The aggressive power assertion subscale was not used because it presented a significantcorrelation with the CTSPC minor assault subscale (r = .72). The CTSPwas selected over the BTS Aggressive Power Assertion Scale because ofthe CTSP's established psychometric proprieties, and tofacilitate comparisons with previous studies of parental discipline. Furthermore, including both subscales in the regression models could result in an overestimation of these variables' regression coefficients and an increase of the standard error of the estimate.Empathy. The Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy (QMEE; Mehrabian & Epstein, 1972) was used to measure levels ofempathy. This 33-item questionnaire has good internal consistency (split- half reliability of .84). Participants are asked to rate on a 9-point Likert scale their level of agreement with a number of statements, such as \"It makes me sad to see a lonely stranger in a group\" and \"I get really angry when Isee someone being ill-treated.\" The QMEE is negativelycorrelatedwithmeasures of aggressivebehavior,andpositively correlated with measures of helping behavior. The QMEE also shows good discriminant validity, and itisnot contaminated by social desirability.RESULTSThe first multiple regression was performed to determine whichvariables predict empathyas measured by the QMEE. The predictorvariables consisted of a series of demographic factors (gender, age, andperson in charge of discipline), and parental use of induction (BTS), non- aggressive power assertion (BTS), major and minor physical discipline (CTSPC), and psychological aggression (CTSPC). Gender was coded into the regression as a dichotomous nominal variable (female = 0; male = 1). The person in charge of discipline was coded as a polychotomous nominal variable. Participants were asked to indicate who was in chargeof enforcing discipline during their childhood. Possible answers included mother, father, both, or other. The option \"other\" was not selected by anyone and was not used. This regression model used \"both\" as the omitted, reference variable.The regression modelwas significant F (9,92) = 4.27, p<.01. Themultiple correlation coefficient was .54, which accounted for 29% of the variance (adjusted R2 was .23). Table 1 contains the summary of this regression model. Three variables were significantly related to empathy. Gender was significantly related to empathy (b = -18.72, p= .01), with females averaging 18.72 points higher than males on the QMEE. Parental use of inductionwas also a significant predictor of empathylevels (b = .27, p < .05).

The regression model was significant, F(9,92) = 2.54, p<.01. The multiple correlation coefficient was .47, whichindicated that approximately 22% of the variance was accounted for bythe model (adjusted R2 was .13). Table 2 contains the summary of theregression model. Two variables were significant predictors of moraljudgment. Minor use of physical discipline was significantly related toPrincipled Morality (b = -.27, p <.01). Empathy was also a significantpredictor of moral judgment (b = .10, p < .05). While empathy andinduction were significantly related, induction was not significantlycorrelated with moral judgment.DISCUSSIONThe purpose of this study was to determine if disciplinary stylespredictlevelsof moral reasoning and emotional empathy. Bothregression models were significant, indicating that parental disciplinestyles were related to levels of empathy and moral reasoning. Minor useof corporal punishment, independent of use of induction and a variety ofother variables, were significant predictors of low levels of emotionalempathy. These results are consistent with Hoffman's (1994) theory,which predicts that the use of harsh discipline prevents the child fromfocusing his attention on the consequences of his/her actions on others.By only focusing on personal consequences, the child may be unable toexperience feelings of empathy and guilt, and thus may create a systemof values that limit him/her from experiencing and expressing empathy.Parental use of induction was also positively related to high levels ofempathy. This is consistent with Krevans & Gibbs' (1996) findings,which indicate that parents who use high levels of induction also havechildren who experience higher levels of empathy and pro-socialbehavior.Empathy was also significantly related to gender, with femalesendorsing higher levels of empathy than males; other studies have foundsimilar results (Sinclair & Bourne, 1998; Trobst, Collins, & Embree,1994). However, the nature of the relationship between gender andempathy appears to be related to the type of measurement used during thestudy. Eisenberg and Lennon (1983; 1987) performed extensive meta-analyses of the literature of gender and empathy and concluded that whilefemales report higher levels of empathy than males during self-reporttests, these gender differences are not significant when empathy isassessed using physiological measures and/or unobtrusive observations.Whilenon-aggressiveinterventionswereunrelatedtomoralreasoning, aggressive power assertion was a moderate but significantpredictor of low levels of principled morality. Parents who use ag- Lopez, Bonenberger, & Schneider PARENTAL DISCIPLINE 201 gressive power assertive techniques may preclude the development of aninternalized set of values, which can result in an over-reliance on externalsanctions when making decisions about moral issues. The use ofaggressive discipline styles may also elicit high levels of emotionalarousal that may prevent the processing of the inductive message presentwithin the discipline encounter. However, the small size of the cor-relation between aggressive power assertion and moral reasoning foundinthis study suggests that many other factors may moderate therelationship between these variables.An alternative explanation of these results postulates an interactionbetween a child's characteristics and parental disciplinary choice.Children with lower internalization of norms may misbehave more,which may elicit higher levels of aggressive discipline. Although thisexplanation seems logical, Lopez, Dula, & Schneider (1999) studied theeffects of different levels of behavioral transgressions on parentaldisciplinary responses, and found that parents increase the use of allforms of discipline interventions (not only corporal punishment) whenconfronted with more severe violations. If children with low moraldevelopment simply require higher levels of discipline, a relationshipbetween high levels of all types of discipline interventions and moralreasoning would be expected. This was not supported, since only minoruse of corporal punishment was significantly related to moral reasoning.Although the findings of Lopez et al. (1999) appear to rule out thisalternative interpretation, more controlled studies are needed to test thishypothesis.Surprisingly, severe corporal punishment was not a predictor of eitherempathy or moral development, primarily because of the very low levelsof severe punishment endorsed by the participants, which significantlyreduced the variance of this variable (67% of the sample received a zeroon the severe punishment subscale). Severe physical punishment mayhave been under-reported, but it is more likely that the sample actuallyexperienced low levels of this type of punishment during childhood. Thecurrent sample contained parents that were highly educated and lesslikely to use severe corporal punishment.The appropriateness and usefulness of non-abusive physical dis-cipline are still being debated. This study suggests that aggressiveparental interventions are related to some negative outcomes. Thefoundation of our interpretation is that the use of aggressive punishmentmay create a state of hyper-arousal that prevents the child from attendingto the inductive message from the parent. However, several studiesindicate that the effect of physical discipline varies by culture (Deater-Deckard & Dodge, 1997). It is possible, that the experience of high levelsof arousal may not be related to the type of discipline used but to the 202NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY child's temperament, perception of the disciplinary intervention, orhis/her culture. Aggressive parental interventions may not elicit strongemotional reactions among children living in specific environmentalcontexts or cultures. It is also possible that children with specific tem-peraments may require different parenting styles in order to facilitatemoral development. Kochanska (1997) found that gentle discipline was associatedwithmoral developmentamong toddlerswithfearfultemperament but not among toddlers with fearless temperament.Future studies should continue to assess the role of temperament andother parental variables in mediating the relationship between aggressivepower assertion and the development of empathy and moral reasoning.Also, it is important to perform longitudinal studies that analyze theeffects that children with low levels of empathy and moral development have on their parent's choice of disciplinary techniques. Finally, longitudinal studies should directly assess the efficacy of combining induction with different types of power assertive techniques in thedevelopment of norm internalization, moral reasoning, and empathy.

An Interview with Russell EisenmanRussell EisenmanUniversity of Texas - Pan American(interviewed on behalf of NAJP by)Michael F. ShaughnessyEastern New Mexico UniversityNAJP: What are you currently working on/researching/writing ?RE: I am doing various things in crime and creativity. I am looking atpersonality characteristics of prisoners, to see if personality traitsassociatedwithcreativitysuchasopenness,fluency, etc.areassociated with reduced recidivism. There is some reason to think thatmore creative thinking in prisoners should lead to reduced recidivism.The typical prisoner is the opposite of the creative person. The prisoners Ihave worked with tend to be rigid, inflexible, not very fluent, unable toproduce many alternatives, etc. They think and behave rigidly withsimple, anti-social rules that govern their behavior. For example, manythink if you show disrespect to them they should respond with violence,perhaps even murder.They do not have flexible ways for dealing with what they identify asdisrespect. They do not even have flexible ways of seeing that what theycall \"disrespect\" might really be something else, like an accidental be-havior on the other person's part. I have done two studies that show thatmost prisoners are low in creativity, relative to the general population.This goes against the romanticized view of the creative criminalsmashing out against the rigid restrictions of society. I think theromanticized view is nonsense. There are a few creative prisoners, and Ihave identified them in one study I did. They are the minority of theprison population. These creative prisoners, like other prisoners whoshow some small amount of creativity, mainly use their creativity in thearea of crime. You could say that is their specialization, their lifestyle.So, from a societal standpoint, what we want are people who will usetheir creativity to go away from anti-social criminal activities andbecome more pro-social. A tough task indeed, to achieve. But, perhaps itcan be done and we have to try. The benefits of doing it are great, and Ithink some prisoners can be reformed. Perhaps most cannot, but many doAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Michael Shaughnessy,Psychology Dept., Eastern New Mexico U., Portales, NM 88130.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 205-216.NAJP 206NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY not want to be criminals, but they have no idea how one does that. So,with training/therapy and help in society, such as job training, drug and alcohol treatment, etc., quitea few could be turned into productive citizens.Of course, an interesting question is this: Could it be that I find littlecreativity because I am dealing with the ones who got caught? Perhaps the creative criminals avoidcaptureat least most of the timeso theydo not get studied. This isa good point. I do not think it is mainly true,although it probably hassome truth to it. There may be a few who fit thatdescription of a creative criminal who avoids capture. Many of the prisoners I worked with had not been caught for long periods of time, but they keep committing crimes, eventually get caught, get out and commit more crimes, are not caught for awhile, then finally get caught again, and so on. But, unlesswe could find creative criminals outside of prison and study them,we cannot really answer the question of whetheror not the ones in prison are there because they were not creative enough to evade capture.A different area I am studying has to do with my interests inmulticulturalism. I am looking at African-American and White School children in the first four grades, and how they are referred by theirteachers for special education and for physical disability services. By physical disability I do notmean the things that people usually think of,such as being unable to walk, but rather anything that is a physical problem, such as poor eyesight or poor hearing. My findings indicate thatthe African-American childrenare much more likely to be seen asneeding services for academic and for physical deficiencies. The big question is \"What does this mean?\" It could mean only that teachersperceive the African American children as needing these services, even if they do not. But, I suspecta lot of it is due to African American childrenneeding services in the twoareas: academic and physical. Perhaps manyof the prenatal problems of African American women cause theirchildren to have various handicaps. If we can identify these handicaps atan early age we can make tremendous improvements, and help AfricanAmerican children have a fair chance in our society.NAJP: What do yousee as the main issues currently facing clinicalpsychology?RE: There are several changes in clinical psychology from the time I was trained. One of the biggest is the recent realization of the importance ofgenetics. Professions seem to go in cycles. When I was trained I learnedthat there used to be na\u00efve genetic assumptions, but that behavior seems largely learned. Now, learning is taking something of a back seat to all Eisenman & ShaughnessyINTERVIEW207 the genetic findings. Much of what we do seems to have a strong geneticcomponent. Of course, genetics and the environment go hand in hand.We often make artificial attempts to separate them. But genetics is muchstronger than many realized. Along the same continuum, there is the fieldof evolutionary psychology, also known as sociobiology. When I firstread a little about how social events could be explained biologically andevolutionarily, I thought it was mostly nonsense. The field seemed to relyon wild speculation. But, as I hear about and read more in the field, a lotof it makes sense. Many of the findings and predictions made byevolutionary psychology make sense to me. Men value youth, beauty andhealth in choosing a female partner, but women value more the powerand status of the male partner; as men get older they are attracted toyounger women; and other findingsthatare explainable on anevolutionary basis, with the main desire being to transmit one's genesinto the future. Clinical psychology needs to take into account the newfindings in genetics and in evolutionary psychology and sociobiology.From an applied standpoint clinical psychology needs to deal withmanaged care. Managed care has taken the power away from thetherapist and put it in the hands of someone who is more concerned withmaking money than with providing proper treatment. There are manyhorror stories. Clinicians that I know tell me that managed care hasreduced their caseloads. They cannot make money like they used tobecause managed care attracts people who formerly would have come tothe clinicians. This is an important issue, having practical and ethicalproblems.NAJP: How can we best train clinical psychologists?RE: We need to train clinical psychologists to know about issues such asgenetics, evolutionary psychology, multiculturalism, and other emer-ging areas, as well as the standard fare. All of education should be moreinterdisciplinary than it is. I have tried to learn much about areas such associology, anthropology, political science, philosophy and other areasthat relate to understanding people. Clinical psychology focuses toomuch on pathology and not enough on normality and creativity. If youthink of a continuum with pathology at one end and creativity at the otherend, clinical psychology has always focused too much on the pathologyend. Creativity is seldom seen as being part of clinical psychology or ofsocial psychology. Yet, itfits importantly into both areas of under-standing. A sad fact is that there are more and more Ph.D.s turned outeach year, yet there are fewer and fewer academic jobs. Training shouldprepare students for other areas in addition to being an academic. To takeonly one possible example,as we have more and more people 208NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY incarcerated, there is increasing need for psychologists to work in theforensic area. Not just in prisons, but working with courts, judges, districtattorneys and the like. By the way, it is not totally bad that we put moreand more people in prison. We lead the world, but perhaps we should,given all the crime we have. Perhaps we need a more creative look atcrime and ask why we have so much in this nation, and what can be doneabout it. In the mean time, lots of bad people need to be locked up. One exception to thisis the War on Drugs, which has partially beenresponsible for incarcerating so many. All too often it is the not the bigtime drug dealer who goes to prison - often for a long time, often wherethe law mandates a long sentence and gives the judge no discretionbutlower level dealers and user. This is crazy and inhumane. The mainreason that the incarceration rate for women has increased so much is theimprisonment of so many women for drug crimes. I used to think that aswomen worked more that they had more opportunities to commit crime,and that is why so many more were going to prison. But, that is not themain reason. The main reason has been the strict enforcement of druglaws. Both men and women are being put into prison at remarkable ratesdue to our War on Drugs, which does not seem to work. It is like the\"Just Say No\" program. Research so far shows that, for the most part, itdoes not work. But, it sounds good. Cops like it. People who don't knowany better like it. It looks good on the six o'clock news show to havefriendly cops with nice looking elementary school kids, and the kidsscreaming \"Just say no to drugs.\" But if it does not work, it is a waste ofresources.NAJP: You have written about the relationship between crime andcreativity. Why does this relationship exist and is it just a spurious one?RE: This question is probably dealing with more than one issue. For onething, there is a negative relationship between prisoners and creativity inmy research. That is, prisoners tend to be low in creativity. Why?Because they come from horrible family backgrounds where theysuffered physical, psychological or sexual abuse. They grow up hatingauthority. They tend to have low intelligence, as measured by various IQtests. They have little toleration of sitting still in school and learning.They end up as having no real job skills and no desire to work for anyoneelse and conform to job demands. Perhaps many of them have AttentionDeficit Disorder with Hyperactivity. They certainly act as if they do. Or,perhapstheyareanti-socialpersonalitiesand conduct disorders(psychopaths in the making), and will not tolerate anything that does notprovide immediate gratification. Anyway, none of this makes for the kindof person who will get the education to learn about ideas and things, and219 Eisenman & ShaughnessyINTERVIEW209 to later come up with creative, innovative ways. Instead, it leads to anangry, authority-hating person who cannot do much in life except work atlow-level, low-paying jobs, or go into crime and make more money. Forsex offenders, many of their problems also seem traceable to horriblefamily rearing experiences, often being sexually abused early in life.They go on to do to others what was done to them. Being abused doesnot usually result in empathy, but instead, in wanting to hurt others asone was hurt.NAJP: Do crime and creativity sometimes go together?RE: Yes! Sometimes there are creative criminals, people who use theircreativity to further their criminal goals. Many psychopaths throughouthistory have been successful in life because they used their creativethinking for anti-social purposes. Others may not be psychopaths, butthey do psychopathictype things and profit via creative thinking.Take Clifford Irving, who fakes a Howard Hughes biography. Hismanuscript took in McGraw Hill, who paid him a six-figure advance.Had not Howard Hughes reversed his stance of not commenting publiclyon anything, and denounced the book as a fraud, Irving would havegotten away with it. As it was, he served a short prison sentence, andcame out and wrote a book about his fraud, which became a best seller. Ithink many public figures, and also people we never hear about, differ ona continuum from having no psychopathic tendency to being your full-blown psychopath (the anti-social personality disorder). Their psy-chopathic tendencies, especially if supplemented with creative thinkingand behaving, help them succeed in life.Long ago, I concluded that Bill Clinton was way above average on thepsychopathic continuum. So I was not surprised at all by the scandalsthat emerged. I am not saying he is a psychopath, only that he is more sothan average. He got caught, but he also got to be President of the UnitedStatesnot a bad achievement. Perhaps he used psychopathic andcreative tendencies to further his goals.NAJP: Is there true rehabilitation for certain criminals?RE: Ithink so. Working with prisoners in the California YouthAuthority, I am impressed with how many seem to be beyond help, evenif they are only 16 years old. They have had a lifetime of crime, so far,and they do not seem motivated to change. All they know, or care toknow, it seems, is how to be the kind of criminal they are: drug dealer,burglar, sex offender, or whatever. However, I would estimate that about15 % can be helped with intensive psychotherapy, job training, drug and 210NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY alcohol treatment. Ideally they should continue to get help after theyleave the prison.This last one is typically neglected, but since so many go back to thesame environment, there is a great need for post-confinement services.Some might think, why waste your time if 85% will not change? Theanswer is that there is a great social advantage to turning around 15 % (orwhatever it is; I confess my ignorance of the true number who can behelped). If 15% are now no longer robbing, murdering, or raping people,that is a great benefit to society. The problem is that we cannot tell whichones belong to the small number who can be helped and which belong tothe probably larger number who cannot be helped. We can sometimestell, as when a prisoner continues to be very anti-social, even in prison,but we cannot really tell most of the time. So we have to have a broad-based attempt to help as many as possible, so that we reach the ones whotruly can be changed.NAJP: As we enter the year 2001 and the new millennium, what are thechallenges facing psychology?RE: The challenges facing psychology are many. The ones I would emphasize are: how do we deal with such areas as violence, drugs(including alcohol, which is a powerful drug), gangs, different racial andethnic groups in the country, the lack of achievement motivation in manyyouth, the lack of parenting by many parents, the increasing reality of thesingle parent home, and probably many things that I have left out.Another question is what kind of research do we do and support.Philip Zimbardo, for example, once described himself as a generalist andchampioned that viewpoint, yet said that the kinds of people who getfaculty jobs at universities are the specialists. Perhaps psychology should reconsider the value of knowing more and more about less and less.Another challenge for psychology, totally unrecognized by most, is agediscrimination. I have faced this in recent years as I have tried to obtainmore suitable academic positions. It is an issue for the entire country, asolder people are often laid off from high level as well as low level jobs,to be replaced by younger, cheaper people. In China, age is thought tolead to wisdom, and elders are given much respect. Here in the U.S., there is prejudice against older people, even by psychologists, whoshould know better. It is pervasive throughout the entire culture. In ourmovies and television shows, we are constantly bombarded with youth, and this is what most people have come to prefer. They show that samepreference when they are in position of authority and can hire someone. Other prejudices as well racial, ethnic, gender make our society alesser place than what it could be. Eisenman & ShaughnessyINTERVIEW211 NAJP: We are increasingly confronted with HMO's and their insistenceon medication as opposed to therapy. What will this perspective do topsychology and managed health care?RE: This will have a horrible effect on psychology and will lead tomanaged care giving medication too often and psychotherapy too little.HMO's are great in one sense, in that they provide services inexpensivelyand thus help many who otherwise might not be helped. But, they also doterrible things sometimes, with an emphasis on the bottom line, dollars.Treatment cannot be based on which method will be the least expensive.We have the best and worst kind of capitalism here.NAJP: Depression remains problematic in spite of Prozac and otherdrugs. To what do you attribute this dilemma?RE: It would seem to me that the drugs do not take care of all of theaspects of depression. Perhaps depression is a multi-dimensional concept,rather than one thing. It could also be that psychotherapy is needed alongwith the drug treatment. People need others to talk to, to get a betterunderstanding of their current situation. Even if one were bio-chemicallyinclined toward depression, and that was reduced or cured by a drug,there mightstillbe a need tosortthingsoutviacounseling,psychotherapy or other \"talking cures.\"NAJP: Stress in modern life is epidemic. How can psychology help?RE: Psychology can be of great help here. Much of stress is self induced,or at least made worse by what people think, as Albert Ellis would say.What people tell themselves often makes things worse for them, or is thebasic cause of their problems.My dentist once complimented me on how well I responded to thevarious dental treatments, and asked if I was using something frompsychology. The basic answer was yes, stress reduction. I try not to focuson what the dentist is doing, I tried to focus on something else, such asstaring at an object in the room. I try to think of pleasant things and Iwork on my fears when they occur by telling myself (thinking) thatthings are not as bad as I am perceiving them, and they will soon be over.All this is basic stress reduction. Psychology provides many insights intohow people think, and how we can make things better or worse forourselves. I constantly talk to people who are non-psychologists, whocreate stress for themselves by what they think about, or who fail to getout of stress when they could. This is not to say that we shouldrationalize away true problems. But we should face them rationally, and222 212NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY that often leads to less stress. Other things, such as taking time out fromour busy world to relax, or engage in sports or exercise can reduce stress.Another stress reducing method is to figure out what would reduce thestress.For example if you are nervous about a presentation, you can rehearseit until you have it down well. Also, you can practice the presentation infront of others, to reduce the stress you will feel when the real daycomes, and you have to present. Psychologists know a lot, and how todeal with stress is one of the things we are good at.NAJP: What are your most important writings ?RE: I write on lots of different topics so there are many different onesthat have been influential, or which I am proud of. I will hit some of thehighlights here, neglecting others that might be equally valuable. In twostudies ( Eisenman, 1992a, 1999 ) I showed that low increativity. In one study ( Eisenman, 1999a) I found that psychotic pris-oners were lower in creativity than conduct disordered prisoners. Thesestudies go against the popular ideas that criminals are creative, or thatcreativity is enhanced by psychosis. Much of my work has shown thatcommonly held ideas are incorrect. Several years ago, there was thepopular notion among researchers that psychopaths do not learn. Thiswould seem to explain why they are they way they are.But, Bernard and Eisenman (1967) showed that not only dopsychopaths learn better than the control group, but also contrary toestablished beliefs among researchers, the psychopaths learned better forsocial praise than they did for money. Perhaps this study and others likeit helped reduce the misconceptions about psychopaths. It is possible thatthey have some learning deficits in certain areas, but to say that overall,psychopaths cannot learn is incorrect.Many researchers think that you cannot change sexual behavior. Youcan change sexual attitudes, but they think that behavior is another story.I showed this to be wrong. When I found that either of two methodscould cause an increase in sexual behavior 1) reducing authoritarianism,and thus enhancing creativity or 2. exposing subjects to a good sexualfantasy ( Eisenman, 1982). This work builds on Grossman and Eisenman(1971), where we showed that reducing authoritarianism increasedcreativity, and increasing author- itarianism reduced creativity.I found that a conservative, somewhat religiously based abstinenceprogram could change school student's sexual attitudes in the direction ofthinking they had more control of their sexual behavior than theypreviously believed, and should abstain ( Eisenman, 1994) .But I did notknow if only attitudes were changed, and not behavior. Only in Eisenman223 Eisenman & ShaughnessyINTERVIEW213 (1982)wasitshownthatsexualbehaviorcouldbechanged.One of my most important findings is that while first borns are morecreative among males, the opposite is true among females. Later bornfemales are more creative than first born females ( eg. Boling, Boling &Eisenman, 1993). Many have realized that first borns are more likely tobe creative than later-borns, but if you look at the findings, these usuallyonly concern males.Among females, the first born gets perhaps too much socialization,and that is harmful for producing a questioning somewhat rebelliousperson, who can come up with creative thoughts and productions. Toooften, sex differences are not considered when research is conducted orreported.The War on Drugs has been going on for some time. Years ago, wefound that high schoolers who used marijuana tended to be more creativethan nonusers (Victor, Grossman & Eisenman, 1973). So the putting ofpeople in prison for using drugs may be putting a disproportionatenumber of creative people behind bars.From working in a prison, I have some idea of what really happens,as opposed to what they want you to think goes on. I have written somearticles critical of the prison organization ( eg. Eisenman, 1991b, 1993a,1995). I have also written about sex offenders and other types ofcriminals that I have encountered ( Eisenman, 1994b, in press) I haveshown that sex offenders can be divided into those who primarily useviolence to get their way versus those who use what I call seduction(although there is violence implicit in what they do), and that the twogroups speak differently in psychotherapy about victims, with the violentsex offenders more likely to denigrate victims ( Eisenman,1993, 1997) .We need to pay more attention to the victim. In courts, the districtattorney represents the state and the defendant has attorneys. No one, forthe most part, represents the victim, and the focus of empathy is on thedefendant. The victim has become forgotten. This is wrong.I am interested in multicultural issues. My dad was a civil rightsactivist in Savannah, Georgia in the 1950's and 1960's working for therights of African Americans. He was a self- appointed activist; he workedalone, organizing groups, meeting with ministers and politicians to getthings done. As a result, I have been strongly concerned about equalrights for all. I described some of my dad's work and the effectsnot allgoodon our family (Eisenman, 1997). I developed a brief coachingmethod that helped African Americans improve their college exam scores( Eisenman, 1991c). I have been fascinated with how people accept theideas of David Duke, a former head of the Ku Klux Klan, who nowdresses in suits instead of Klan robes and says his earlier actions wereyouthful indiscretions. He seems like the same old racist to me, but often 214NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY not 1993c, Eisenman, Girdner, Burroughs& Routman, 1993). Part of his appeal may be that he is one of the fewpeople who consistently and publicly speak out against affirmative action and for the rights of whites, which many whites would like to do, but areafraid to do because of the likely negative consequences.I have developed the concept of deviance, which is usually employedonly by sociologists and generally meant only negative things. However, a few of us believe that deviance can refer to something positive, e.g. creativity. I wrote about this in my creativity/crime/ deviance book(Eisenman, 1991a).Sometimes society tolerates too much deviance of the negative kind, and as a result, society is aworse place to live. However, sometimesdeviance is created when little or nothing wrong has been done, as in the witch hunts. A modern day witch hunt often occurs when someone is charged with sexual harassment.The term is so vague that anything can be said to be sexualharassment and the charged person is often almost as good as convicted,once accused. I presented three case histories of university facultycharged with sexual harassment (Eisenman, 1999). As far, as I know, Iam the only person to interview, in detail, people charged with sexualharassment and to show the psychological harm to them, in terms of theirexperiencing anxiety and depression, to the possible point of considering suicide. They also face employment harm, as the sexual harassmentcharge often causes one to lose employment, and to be non-employable,as others react negatively to the stigma they now have. Yet the chargesare often based on very flimsy evidence or involve things that many would not see as harmful at allMy research is often motivated by attempting to solve a mystery, orbeing angry about how something is presented, when I think it should beseen in an entirely different light. There is nothing wrong with an angerthat results in more meaningful information being gathered, as opposedto an anger that cripples you from work or that leads to attacks on others.

Six sets of basic facial expressions were obtained fromEkman & Friesen's (1976) Pictures of facial affect. We divided eachexpression process into ten temporal segments. Facial images weremorphed by a computer, each consisting of a series of faces differing by aconstant physical amount, as they change from the neutral expression tothe maximal. Participants rated those facial images by a 6-point Liked-type scale. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis revealed thatvarious emotion categories fell into the same cluster at various steps fromthe segment 1to 4, and that positions of emotion categories formed acircumplex at the segment 5, and that the circumplex pattern was fixedfrom the segment 6 to 10. It was suggested that there was a critical pointof the change of emotion space between segment 4 and 5.Facialexpressions seem toofferthe most readilyavailableinformation about social interactions in our daily life. So far, manyresearchers have attempted to clarify various aspects about facialexpressions. For example, Esteves and Ohman (1993) focused on therecognition (see Kirouac & McAndrew, 1986). Using the backwardly masked faces byneutral facial displays, they showed that confident recognitions of facialexpressions required about 100-250 msec., with shorter time for happythan for angry expressions. Hess and Kleck (1994) mentioned on thediscrimination between posed and spontaneous expressions (see also;Zuckerman, Hall, DeFrank, & Rosenthal, 1976). They discussed that ameasure of the level of perceived honest demeanor of the stimuluspersons based on their neutral expressions was found to relate toperceivers'accuracyindiscriminatingposedar.dspontaneousexpressions. Ekman (1992,1994) argued that emotions might beconsidered discrete in a sense and also emphasized the categoricalperception of \"basic emotions\". Other researchers have arrived addition, Ekman(1980) discussed the idea that there were some facial expressions ofAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: University, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8530, Japan.takehara@psychology.doshisha.ac. jp.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 217-228.NAJP2 7 218NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY emotion which were universal and Buck (1988) argued that facialexpressions were correctly recognized in widely different cultures.Furthermore, Russell and Bullock (1985, 1986) tried to representdimensional structure of the face recognition from preschoolers to adults,and Takehara and Suzuki (1997) also showed the dimensionality of theface recognition using morphed facial expressions as stimuli. Takeharaand Suzuki (1997) asked participants to rate the morphed facial imageon a Likert-type scale, then they derived a two-dimensional solution.Similar to Russell and Bullock (1985, 1986), two axes of Pleasure-Displeasure and intensity of arousal were found. However, their resultshowed that participants tended to confuse fear expression with surpriseexpression. About confusion of emotions, Ekman, et al. (1982) alsoargued that fearful and surprised expressions were easily confused.Although there have been many studies about facial expressions asdescribed above, comparatively little attention has been directed to thequestion of whether other types of information might be communicatedby facial expressions of emotions (Edwards, 1998). One of the importantpieces of information that should not be ignored is the \"time series\" asEkman (1984) mentioned that emotion had an onset, a peak, and anoffset, suggesting the importance of the time series'. In this study, wedefine the temporal change from the neutral to the prototype as the time series. Edwards (1998) also argued importance of temporal cues embedded in facial displays. It is, however, true that many studiesexploring emotion recognition or perception typically tend to addressonly to the final states of the expressive process or near the maximalexpression and do not pay attention to the subtle and ambiguous changeof facial information over time. Edwards (1998) noted the importance oftemporal changes (i.e., time series) or cues of facial expressions andtested the hypothesis that individuals could detect extremely subtledynamic cues that convey the temporal status of facial expressions ofemotions. Edwards found the following interesting facts: (1) individual scould detect extremely subtle dynamic cues in a facial expression; (2)individuals were most sensitive to the temporal characteristics of theearly stages of an expression. It is interesting to note that individuals are sensitive to the temporal characteristics of the early stages of anexpression while the expressions at the early stage have less amount ofemotional information.As for the circumplex model of affect, it is considered that all sixbasic emotion categories might not have clear boundaries between them,even for the maximal (i.e., prototype) expressions (Takehara & Suzuki,2000). This suggests that each emotion may have the other emotionalcomponents rather than only one. For example, the expression betweenHappiness and Surprise on the perimeter of a circumplex may have both22 Takehara 8i, SuzukiDIFFERENTIAL PROCESS 219 emotional components of Happiness and Surprise (e.g., Takehara &Suzuki, 1997, 2000). The less emotional information a face has, the morelikely the face would have other emotional components. As suggested byTakehara and Suzuki (1998) and Suzuki and Takehara (2000), researchon the structure of emotion recognition (i.e., emotion space) over time(i.e., from an onset to a peak) may indicate that emotion boundaries at thebeginning of expressions might be less distinguishable than at the peak.In other words, emotion space might have an ambiguous prototype at thebeginning, and as time elapses, it may be differentiated into particularstructural patterns.Several studies have used spontaneous facial expressions as stimuli,and there seem to be a few fundamental problems associated with theprocedure. First, it is difficult to standardize the duration of each emotionbecause each has different duration from an onset to the peak. Forexample, an expression of surprise has a shorter duration than that ofsadness. Second, since each spontaneous expression seldom has the sameorientation of such attributes as intensity, distinctness and temporalphase, it is difficult to prepare stimuli which are comparable on theseattributes. This problem is more important than one may acknowledgebecause the stimuli need to be standardized and controlled for thecomparability of outcomes. To mitigate this problem, we used the Ekmanand Friesen (1976) face set and generated interpolated facial images froma neutral expression to its peak, using a morphing technique.We hypothesize that if each emotion had several other emotioncomponents, the emotion space would be complex and ambiguous at thebeginning of the expression, and that it would be differentiated into aparticular spatial pattern over time. Thus, the goal of this study is toinvestigate whether the emotion space will be differentiated from theambiguous recognition structure to a more typical one over time.Regarding the task, we asked participants to rate the morphed facialimages by a Likert-type scale. Then, based on the dissimilarities, therelationships of faces at each temporal segment were represented in thetwo-dimensionalpsychologicalspace by multidimensional scaling(MDS) and cluster analysis.METHODStimuliIn order to generate standardized facial stimuli, we used the Ekmanand Friesen (1976) series (Face JJ) because all facial stimuli haveconsistent quality, angle, and orientation, with standardized pose andcontrolled lightning. In the case of selecting emotior. categories, wechose six basic emotions of Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust,and Surprise, and one Neutral which were considered to cover a universal229 220NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY range of emotion2. To introduce time sequence, we used morphing,which can generate interpolated images between two parent images. Wedivided each expression process into ten temporal segments, and choseten corresponding facial images from the beginning to the end (i.e.,maximum) as stimuli. Relationships between four of the ten temporalsegments and the corresponding morphed facial image are shown inFigure 1. All the resulting facial images, running from the neutral ex- Segment 1Segment 4Segment 7Segment 10(Beginning) (Maximal) FIGURE 1Facial images corresponding to four of the 10 temporalsegments. This example shows the Happiness continuum.pression to the maximal prototype expression, provided continuity andthe same photographic quality. In total, 60 facial images (6 basic emotioncategories x 10 segments) were generated and all were used in this study.In addition, one geographic pattern image, which had no emotionalinformation, but consisting of a triangle, a circle, and a square, wasgenerated.ParticipantsThe participants were 43 undergraduate students (13 males and 30females ranging in age from 18 to 21 years with the mean of 18.8 years).They volunteered to be subjects in order to get a credit for a psychologycourse. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.ProcedureSixty generated facial images were displayed one at a time in arandom order on a 14.1-inch LCD with 240x320 pixels. Note that anemotionless geographic pattern image was presented before each facial0MST COIPY AVAELABLE Takehara & SuzukiDIFFERENTIAL PROCESS 221 image in order to minimize any influence of the previous facial image onthe current image. The distance between a participant and a monitor wasabout 50 cm. Data were collected by a Compaq personal computer(DESKPRO; Pentium II Processor 350 MHz) with a two-button mouseand by a rating software made by an Inprise C++ compiler (Borland C+--Builder Version 4). Participants were asked to rate each facial image onthe 6-point Likert-type scale (from \"not at all\" to \"so very much\") abouteach item of the six basic emotions of Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Fear,Disgust, and Surprise by clicking the mouse. By single-clicking of the\"Next Image\" button on the window, an emotionless geographic patternimage was presented for two seconds, followed by a next facial image.No feedback was given. Before the rating, two practice trials were giveneach subject.RESULTSMDS refers to a set of procedures used to depict proximities spatiallybetween phenomena and detects hidden structure underlying complexcognitive constructs (Kruskal & Wish, 1978). This procedure provides avisual representation of the relations among the stimuli by placing themin a geometric space of specified dimensionality. One possible area ofapplication for MDS is facial expressions of emotion and a number ofstimulus sets have been studies using a wide range of procedures tocollect the data and a variety of MDS techniques (Bimler & Kirkland,1997). MDS has been frequently applied to studies on the structure ofemotion (e.g., Abelson & Sermat, 1962 ; 1985, 1986; Takehara & Suzuki,1997). In the current study, rating data were used to calculate a matrix ofdissimilarities among six emotion categories for each temporal segment,and MDS was carried out to find coordinates of the six emotioncategories in the Euclidean space at each of ten temporal segments,respectively. The ALSCAL procedure from the Statistical Package forthe Social Science (SPSS) was used, and extracted two solutions. Figure2 shows its two-dimensional representation of the six emotion categoriesat the maximal expression. Greater dissimilarity between two facialimages is represented by their greater distance. For the two-dimensionalconfiguration, each stress and R-square values are shown in Table 1.Kruskal and Wish (1978) and Coxon (1982) recommended the use ofcluster analysis to aid the interpretation of the MDS solutions and weexpected distinct patterns of relationships among the six emotioncategories. Therefore, we employed hierarchical cluster analysis fromSPSS, using the average linkage of squared distances between groups.We incorporated six variables in cluster analysis: Happiness, Sadness,Anger, Fear,Disgust, and Surprise.In each successive stage of/ 222NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY hierarchical clustering, the distance between clusters was calculated andthe closest clusters were combined. Thus, clusters combined at the firststage were closer to one another than those combined at the second stage.An example of a resultant cluster is presented in Figure 2. The circles,including deformed circles, depicted in Figure 2 represent the clusteringschedule obtained from cluster analysis. The smaller inner circlesrepresent the successive clustering in the hierarchical clustering scheme.Then, in order to see the detailed relations of emotions and changes ofemotion space over time, let us look at each temporal segment. 1.5 1.0 0.5cOE 0.0Ea-0.5 -1.0Happiness -2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51 01.5Dimension 22.02.510 FIGURE 2. An example of a two dimensional solution at each of tentemporal segments. Clusters are presented at the same time. The number depicted on the upper-right of this graph represents the segmentcorresponding to Figure 1. At Segment 1(i.e., beginning of the expression), two-dimensionalsolutions and clusters were not distinguishable. \"Sadness\" and \"Surprise''are combined first. Next, \"Happiness,\" positive emotion, was combinedwith\"Sadness-Surprise\"cluster,and\"Disgust\"and \"Fear\"were combined into a single cluster. Finally, \"Anger\" was combined with\"Sadness-Surprise-Happiness\" cluster. Interpretation of both axes isdifficult because they are mixed with negative and positive emotions.At Segment 2, \"Disgust\" and \"Surprise\", and \"Anger\" and \"Fear.'were combined respectively. Then, \"Sadness\" was added to the \"Disgust-Surprise\" cluster, and finally emotions, except \"Happiness,\" formed asingle cluster. It is still difficult to interpret the axes.At Segment 3, \"Disgust\" and \"Surprise\" were combined first. Next,\"Fear\" was added to the \"Disgust-Surprise\" cluster, and \"Sadness\" was232 Takehara & SuzukiDIFFERENTIAL PROCESS 223 added to the \"Disgust-Surprise-Fear\" cluster, and finaly, \"Happiness\"was added to the \"Disgust-Surprise-Fear-Sadness\" cluster. Again, it isstill difficult to interpret the axes. TABLE 1Stress and R-Square Values at were first combined. Next,\"Sadness\" was added to the \"Disgust-Fear\" cluster. Then, \"Surprise\" and\"Happiness\" were combined, and finally, \"Anger\" was combined with the\"Disgust-Fear-Sadness\" cluster. For this time segment, the horizontalaxis may be considered to be the dimension of pleasure and displeasure,and the vertical axis intensity of arousal. Names of the axes, however,leave some uncertainty, because \"Happiness\" which i.s an absolutelypositive emotion, for example, is combined with \"Surprise\" which maynot contain any ingredients of positive emotion.At Segment 5, \"Disgust\" and \"Anger\" were first combined, and then\"Fear\" and \"Surprise\" were combined. \"Sadness\" was added to the \"Fear-Surprise\" cluster, and finally, all emotions except \"Happiness\" fell intothe single cluster. At this time segment of time, the two-dimensionalsolution shows approximately a circular order of emotions as Russell(1980) suggested. Moreover, only \"Happiness\" makes its own cluster.The results show that the horizontal axis can be considered the dimensionof pleasure and displeasure, and that the vertical axis the intensity ofarousal in terms of relationships of clusters and relative positions ofemotion categories.From Segment 6 to Segment 10 (i.e., the maximal expression), therewere no changes to the circular order and clustering steps. In a nutshell,relative positions of emotion categories were similar to those of Russell's(1980)3, and \"Anger\"was combined with \"Disgust\" in the first step,\"Fear\" was combined with \"Surprise\", \"Sadness\" was added to the 224NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY \"Anger-Disgust\" cluster, then all emotions except \"Happiness\" fell into asingle cluster. As for the interpretation of both axes, the horizontal axis isconsidered the dimension of pleasure and displeasure, and the verticalaxis the intensity of arousal, identical to those at Segmen: 5.DISCUSSIONAs Edwards (1998) pointed out, the notion that the temporalinformation might be an important factor of emotion recognition hasnever been examined systematically. As did Edwards, we considered\"time\" to be an important factor, and investigated how individuals'emotion space would change over time. For our experiment, wegenerated morphed facial images of each of six basic emotions runningfrom the neutral expression to the maximal one, and we then divided theexpressionprocessintotentemporalsegments,andchosetencorresponding facial images from the beginning (neutral) to the end(maximal). We only selected face JJ, because we wanted to eliminate theeffect of or influence by other faces. This is not a major problem becauseface JJ is used in many studies (e.g., Takehara & Suzuki, 1997; Young,Rowland, Calder, Etcoff, Seth, & Perrett, 1997).Let us discuss external validity of our artificial technology calledmorphing. Among all facial images, only the neutral and six prototypeswere real images, meaning that most images used were artificiallygenerated. Although those images do not exist in nature, the advantage ofusing morphed images is that it is easy to generate any interpolatedimages, making it possible to control the amount of physical changes.The best of all is that morphing provides us with a means of generatingobjective images. Recently, a number of researchers have used theprocedure of morphing (e.g., Beale & Keil, 1995; Takehara & Suzuki,1997, 2000; Tanaka et al., 1998; Young et al., 1997). While morphingtechnology may degrade the quality of the images, thus making emotionsless discernable than actual images, this is clearly not a major problem, for the current findings show that emotion space became stable atSegment 5, indicating easy recognition of \"generated\" faces.As for the handling of the time variable, the current study has shownsuccessful grasp of the time as an important factor for the study ofemotion. It would be true that the randomization of facial images canenhance control. However, its combination with the temporal factor canhardly be justified. Genuine temporal recognition of facial expressionsappears to be context driven, making the preceding image vitallyimportant for the following facial image. If face recognition was influenced by the context so much, however, the configuration ofemotion space over time may never reach a distinctly stable stage. Thecurrent study did not use any context for emotion. But, the study 2.334 Takehara & SuzukiDIFFERENTIAL PROCESS 225 successfully identified a stable configuration of emotion space, shortlyafter Segment 4 and definitely at Segment 5, which lasted until the lastSegment. It is interesting to note that man can recogn::ze the temporalchanges of the face without any context information.To reiterate, distance relationships among the six emotion categorieswere transformed to two-dimensional emotion space for each timesegment by MDS and cluster analysis was then applied to theconfiguration to examine the differential processes of emotion space.This visual examination of the temporal processes has proven to be veryuseful.It revealed that various emotion categories fell into various clustersfrom Segment 1 to Segment 4, that the positions of the six basic emotioncategories formed a circumplex at Segment 5, and that this circumplexpattern continued stable from Segment 6 to Segment 10. The currentfindings agree with those of Takehara and Suzuki (1998) who reported achange of each emotion category from an ambiguous prototype at thebeginning of the temporal process into a particular emotion category atthe end. The fact that emotion space is completely differentiated betweenSegment 4 and Segment 5 (i.e., differentiated by the midpoint throughthe expression process) suggests that individuals are able to identify theother's facial expressions, which are at a comparatively early stages ofthe expression process. This might be consistent with Edwards (1998)who discussed that sensitivity to the temporal properties of an emotionalexpression may be greatest for the early stages of the expression.With respect to the interpretation of axes in two-dimensional space,neither distance relationships among emotion categories by MDS norclassificationrelationships by clusteranalysis can offer anythingdefensible before Segment 5. For example, because a positive emotionHappiness and a non positive emotion Surprise fell into the same clusterat Segment 4, we could not interpret the axes in any meaningful way. Itmight be reasonable to say that both axes could not be ipterpreted for theearly stages of the expression because each emotion category started withseveralotheremotional components before they were graduallydifferentiated. In contrast, after Segment 5, the horizontal axis was con-sidered the dimension of pleasure and displeasure, and the vertical axisthe intensity of arousal.Studies which focused only on the maximal expressions would neverfind that emotion categories get differentiated with other variousemotional components as time elapses at the early stages of theexpression. The current study demonstrated not only the importance ofthe research paradigm over time, but also the possible existence of acritical time point of emotion space between Segment 4 and Segment 5.The findings might be useful to study about micro-expressions of faces.za, 226NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Although we divided the expression process into ten temporal segments,more segments may be needed to investigate the differertial processes of emotion space over time if we were to use micro-expressions of faces.

Healthy Perfectionism and Positive ExpectationsAbout CounselingJ. M. OliverBrett A. HartMichael J. RossBarry M. Katz1Saint Louis UniversityThis study examined the relation between perfectionism as measured bythe Multi-Dimensional Perfectionism Scale and expectations aboutcounseling (EAC's) as measured by the Expectations About Counseling-Brief Form in 200 undergraduates. Preliminary analyses indicated thatSelf-Oriented, Other-Oriented, and Socially-Prescribed Perfectionismwere linearly related to all 17 facets of EAC's and that subscales of theEAC were the appropriate unit of analysis. Canonical correlationdemonstrated a significant relation between dimensions of perfectionismand EAC's such that adaptive perfectionism appeared to be associatedwith positive EAC's for the client, the counselor, and counselingoutcome and process. Results provide further support for a healthy typeof perfectionism and suggest that it may indicate a good candidate forcounseling.The purpose of this study was to examine the relation betweenperfectionism and expectations about counseling in a large group ofunselected undergraduate students. Several recent reports have suggestedthe existence of an adaptive as distinct from a 1998), and previous research suggests thatpositive expectations about counseling may be associated with bettertherapy process and outcome it remained to be discovered whether adaptive perfectionismcould be detected in another undergraduate sample and, if so, whethersuch perfectionism might be related to expectations about counseling.Current investigators seem to construe adaptive perfectionists as asubgroup of perfectionists (LoCicero perfectionism refines previousstudy ofperfectionism, which had established that overall, perfectionism is a riskfactor for maladjustment and psychopathology of many types.

Adaptive perfectionists appear to set higherstandards for academic performance and to have with higher levels ofperceived self-efficacy, both general self-efficacy and social self-efficacy; however, they appear to be less concerned than others about dis-crepancies between their standards and their performance (LoCicero &Ashby, 2000). Adaptive perfectionists acknowledge higher levels ofconscientiousness, but they also describe themselves in generally positiveterms, such as agreeable and extraverted (Parker, 1997).Perfectionism generally has been found to be associated with a widerange of maladjustment and psychopathology, including depression (Flettet & Flett,1990); and alcoholism, anorexia nervosa, bulimia,personality disorders, chronic pain, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Hewitt & Flett, 1991a). Maladaptive perfectionists have among typical college (LoCicero & Ashby, 2000);college undergraduates with learning disabilities (Saddler & Buck land,1995); medical and dental students (Ey, Henning, & Shaw, 2000); andgifted pre-secondary students (Parker, 1997). Maladaptive perfectionistsappear to experience significant others as setting high standards for them,having high expectations of them, and being critical of them. They also tend to be concerned about discrepancies between standards and theirperformance (LoCicero & Ashby, 2000); to have decreased self-esteem (Rice, 1998); to have lower perceived self-efficacy (LoCicero &Ashby, 2000); to procrastinate more and to be depressed (Saddler &Buck land, 1995; Saddler & Sacks, 1993); and not to seek formal sourcesof help despite high levels of distress and to have more negative attitudesabout mental health services (Ey, et al., 2000).Hewitt and Flett (1991) have identified three specific and independentcomponents of perfectionism that may be characterized by their origin(the self or others) and their target (the self or others). Self-orientedperfectionism is perfectionism that originates in the self and is directedtoward the self; it entails setting high standards for the self, striving to meet these standards, and stringent self-evaluations of one's own Oliver, Hart, Ross, KatzPERFECTIONISM & EXPECTATIONS 231 performance. Other-oriented perfectionism originates in the self but isdirected toward others; it entails setting unrealistically high standards forsignificant others, placing importance on these others' being perfect, andstringently evaluating others' performance.Socially-prescribed per-fectionism is perceived as originating in significant others and beingdirected toward the self; it entails perceptions that significant others setunrealistically high standards for oneself, pressure one to be perfect, andevaluate one's own performance stringently. As indicated above, recentinvestigators have found adaptive perfectionists to be characterized byself-oriented perfectionism, in contrast to maladaptive perfectionists, whoare characterized by socially-prescribed perfectionism.Expectations of counseling constitute one indicator of potentialclients' willingness to seek help and of their likely success in therapy.Individuals who harbor more positive expectations of counseling aremore willing to seek help and, once in therapy, are more likely to get offto a good start. Recent research suggests that favorable expectationsabout counseling have a positive impact on the course and outcome oftherapy. For example, clients with higher expectations are more involvedin the first interview (Tinsley et al., 1994) and have a stronger workingalliance (Al- Darmaki & Kivlighan, 1993; Tokar et al., 1996).Many measures have been developed to measure expectations abouttherapy and counseling (Hayes & Tinsley, 1989). The ExpectationsAbout Counseling-Brief Form (EAC-B; Tinsley, 1982) is the measurethat simultaneously is the most widely-used and whose psychometricproperties are best known. Tinsley and his colleagues (Tinsley, Work-man, & Kass,1980) designed the parent instrument, the longerExpectations About Counseling-Full Form, rationally torepresentexpectations about counseling in three distinct realms: 1) client attributes;2) counselor attributes; and 3) counseling process and outcome. Tinsleyand others (Hortman, 1984; Tinsley et al., 1980) factor analyzed the EACto discern the empirical structure as distinct from the theoretical structureof the scale and extracted four dimensions: 1) Personal Commitment(investment of the client in the counseling process and outcome); 2)Facilitative Conditions (aspects of the counseling relationship andprocess that foster progress); 3) Counselor Expertise (attitudes andbehaviors of the counselor that foster progress); and 4) Nurturance(characteristics of the counselor that are experienced as supportive by theclient). The brief form of the instrument retained the factor structure andpsychometric properties of the original form while decreasing participanttime The EAC-B has lent itself to application in empirical researchconcerned with counseling initiation, process, and outcome.241 232NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY It seems plausible that individuals who harbor adaptive perfectionismmay have a sense of personal control over initiating therapy and over its course and outcome; have positive, high standards for course and outcome; and have a sense of self-efficacy in bringing about a positive course and outcome,leadingtooverallpositiveexpectations of counseling. It likewise seems plausible that individuals who harbormaladaptive perfectionism may lack a lack of a sense of control overinitiating therapy; may sense that significant others or the therapist willset exacting standards for the course and outcome of therapy; and lack asense of self-confidence in bringing about a positive course and outcome,culminatinginoverall negative expectations of counseling. Sinceundergraduate students as agroup are selected for psychological healthand high achievement strivings, we predicted that we would identify atype of adaptive, healthy perfectionism, and that it would be associated with positive expectations about counseling.METHODParticipantsThe investigation was conducted in 200 undergraduate students at a mid-size private Catholic university in the Midwest. Generally, par- ticipants were about 70% female; between the ages of 18 and 21; about 80% Caucasian with substantial minorities of African-American and Asian students but little representation of other ethnic minorities; about 60% Catholic; 94% native-English-speaking; about 50% first yearstudents with the remainder about equally divided among the other yearlevels. They represented a broad range of majors and family social classbackgrounds as indicated by parental income.MeasuresMulti-Dimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS): The MPS (Hewitt & Flett, 1989) is a 45-item self-report measure. Hewitt and Flett (1989)constructedthe MPS as relatively independent self- orientedperfectionism;other-orientedperfectionism;andsocially- prescribed perfectionism. Self-oriented perfectionism pertains to stan-dards for the self; is postulated to constitute vulnerability to self-criticism, self-blame, and anxiety; and is assessed by items asking whether the respondent strives to be the best at everything he or she does.Other- oriented perfectionism pertains to standards for others; is postulated topredispose toward criticism and blame of others and feelings of anger; and is assessed by items asking whether the respondent cannot stand to see people close to him or her make mistakes. Socially-prescribed2 ,42 Oliver, Hart, Ross, KatzPERFECTIONISM & EXPECTATIONS 233 perfectionism pertains to the perception that others, typically significantothers, have high and unreasonable standards for the self. It is postulatedto predispose one toward a sense of constant pressure and anxiety; and isassessed by items asking whether the respondent perceives others asexpecting more of him or her than the individual is capable of giving.Each sub-scale comprises 15 items.Participants indicate their responses to each item on a 7-point Likertscale whose anchors are \"strongly disagree\" and \"strongly agree.\" Scoreson both the sub-scales and the total scale are expressed as the total of theitems included, resulting in a range of 15-105 for each sub-scale and 45-315 for the total score.Coefficient a's of .88, .74, and .81 have been reported for the self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially-prescribed reliabilities across athree-month interval of .88, .85, and .75 have been reported for the self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially-prescribed perfectionism sub-scales,respectively (Hewitt & Flett, 1991a), indicating that perfectionism isquite a stable dimension of personality.Construct validity of the MPS has been supported by principal-components factor analysis, which yielded three factors corresponding tothe three dimensions of perfectionism proposed on a theoretical basis(Hewitt & Flett, 1991a). Convergent and discriminant validity of theMPS have been demonstrated in differential associations between thethree dimensions of perfectionism and measures pertaining to standardsfor the self, for others, and for social situations, respectively.Expectations About Counseling Scale-Brief Form (EAC-B): TheEAC-B (Tinsley, 1982) was developed as a brief version of the original,147-item self-report instrument. Correspondence between the brief andparentinstrumentsishighasindicated by correlationsbetweencorresponding sub-scales and factors which range from .81 to .95. Thebrief form contains 66 items making up 17 sub-scales that contribute tofactors and one experimental subscale. Of the 17 sub-scales of the EAC-B, three measure expectations about client attributes(Motivation,Openness, and Responsibility); 11 measure expectations about counselorattributes (Acceptance, Confrontation, Empathy, Gen-uineness, Nurturance, Self-Disclosure, Attractiveness, Expertise, Tol-erance, and Trustworthiness); and three measure expectations aboutprocess and outcome (Concreteness, Immediacy, and Outcome).Participants respond to each item on a Likert scale whoseanchors are \"not true\" and \"very true\". Scores are reported as averagesof the items making up each subscale and each factor of the instrument,yielding a range for both subscales and factor scores ranging from 0 to 7. 234NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Coefficients a's for the 17 scales have been reported to range from .69 to .82 with a median value of .76 (Tinsley, 1982). Test-retest reliabilities of the sub-scales across a two-month interval have beenreported to range from .47 to .87 with a median value of .71 (Tinsley,1982).Construct validity of the EAC-B has been supported in an invest-igation using a thought-listing technique to tap participants' spontaneouscognitionselicitedbyeachitem(Tinsley & Westcot,1990).Discriminantvalidityhas been demonstratedinafactor-analyticinvestigation of seven instruments comprising 33 subscales and 23dimensions of counseling, from which two sets of factors were extracted:three factors pertaining to expectations about counseling and three factorspertaining to perceptions of counseling (Hayes & Tinsley, 1989).Further, the EAC-B has been reported to diverge from measures ofstudent developmental task, psychological problems, and counselingreadiness (Tinsley, Hinson, Holt, & Tinsley, 1990, GPA.ProcedureParticipants were recruited through undergraduate college courses.Participants were promised complete anonymity and completion of thecomposite questionnaire was taken toindicate informed consent.Participants were offered extra credit in their course as an incentive fortheir participation.RESULTSMeans, standard deviations, and coefficient a's of psychologicalvariables are displayed in Table 1. Means and standard deviations on theMPS were similar to those reported for a community sample of 100 malesand 99 females (Hewitt, Flett, Turnbull-Donovan, & Mikail, 1991);means and standard deviations on the subscales of the EAC-B closelyresembled those reported in 40 undergraduates reared in the United States(Yuen & Tinsley, 1981). Coefficient cc's generally indicate high internalconsistency of each sub-scale. Oliver, Hart, Ross, KatzPERFECTIONISM & EXPECTATIONS 235 TABLE 1Means, Standard Deviations, and Coefficient Alphas ofPsychological Variables Psychological Variable Multi- were conducted to ascertain whether relationsbetween perfectionism and expectations about counseling were linear orcurvilinear.It could be argued that perfectionism would be curvilinearlyrelated to expectations about counseling and that the people who aremoderately perfectionistic would have the highest expectations forcounseling, whereas those who were least perfectionistic and mostperfectionistic would have relatively lower expectations for counseling.The shape of relations between dimensions of perfectionism andcomponents of the EAC-B was examined by means of one-way analysesof variance. Each dimension of perfectionism was taken in turn as theindependent variable after trichotomizing the dimension using cut-pointsone standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the mean;sub-scales and summarizing components of the EAC and maladjustmentwere analyzed as dependent variables. In each case in which the relation245 236NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY between a dimension of perfectionism and a facet of the EAC wassignificant, the relation as linear: higher levels of perfectionism wereassociated with higher expectations on the EAC. TABLE 2 Summary of Canonical Correlation Analysis of Dimensions ofPerfectionism and Subscales -.43 Factor analysis was used to determine the most appropriate way ofsummarizing and combining the 17 subscales of the EAC. Maximum-likelihood factor analysis specifying four factors and followed by bothVarimax and Oblimin rotations was conducted to try to recover the fourfactors previously extracted by Tinsley and others (Hortman, 1984; Tinsley et al., 1980). Although a four-factor solution seemed indicatedby both eigenvalues and a scree plot, the four factors taken togetheraccounted for only about 57% of the variance, so the solution did notsummarize the instrument particularly well. Of particular concern was the fact that the four factors did not correspond well to Personal Com-mitment, Facilitative Conditions, Counselor Expertise, and Nurturance,respectively: according to Harmon's coefficient of congruence; cor-respondences were .56, .36, .51, and .36 for the four pairs of factors,respectively. Further, the factors we extracted seemed to representamalgams of client attributes, counselor attributes, and process andoutcome; the factors seemed to lack psychological coherence. Oliver, Hart, Ross, KatzPERFECTIONISM & EXPECTATIONS 237 For this reason, we turned to the 17 subscales of Expectations AboutCounseling as the appropriate unit of analysis. Coefficient a's of thesubscales were generally high; M = .76, range = .68-.83.Zero-order correlations with one-tailed tests of significance werecalculated between the three dimensions of perfectionism and the 17subscales of Expectations About Counseling. Of the 51 correlations, 12were significant at or beyond the .05 level. Self-Oriented Perfectionismwas significantly correlated with one client attribute (Responsibility [r =.16, p = .013]; five counselor attributes (Acceptance [r = .26, p = .000];Confrontation [rp = .005]; Expertise [r = .12, p = .044]; Tolerance[r = .24 p = .000]; and Trustworthiness [r = .21, p = .001]; and twocharacteristics of process/outcome (Immediacy [r = .16, p .014]; andOutcome [r .14, p = .024]). Other-Oriented Perfectionism was sig-nificantly correlated with two counselor attributes: Acceptance (r = .16,p = .011) and Tolerance (r = .14, p = .027). Socially-Prescribed Per-fectionism was also significantly correlated with two counselor attributes:Directiveness (r = .12, p = .044) and Genuineness (r = -.13, p = .033).Df s ranged from 193-196.Canonical correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationsamong all dimensions of perfectionism and the 10 subscales of the EAC-B that were significantly associated with at least one dimension ofperfectionism.Results indicated that one of three possible canonicalvariates was significant at or beyond the .05 level of significance; WilksX= .76, df = 30, p = .008; however, according to the Stuart-Love Re-dundancy Index, this canonical variate explained only 3.5% of thevariance in the dependent variables. F tests indicated that Self-Orientedand Socially-Prescribed Perfectionism were significantly related tosubscales of the EAC-B and that of the 10 subscales of the EAC-B, allwere significantly related to dimensions of perfectionism except Di-rectiveness.Structure coefficients of the canonical variate relating dimensions ofperfectionism to facets of EAC's are displayed in Table 2. As shown inTable 2, Trustworthiness (an expectation about counselors) was moststrongly and highly related to the canonical variate; Acceptance (anexpectation about counselors), Immediacy and Outcome (characteristicsexpected of process and outcome) and Responsibility (an expectationabout participants as clients) were also moderately related to thecanonical variate. Genuineness, Expertise, Tolerance, and Confrontation(all expectations about counselors) were significantly related to thecanonical variate, but to a lesser degree. Because this configuration ofsubscales of Expectations About Counseling spanned all three rationally-based components of expectations (client attributes, counselor attributes,2 4 238NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY and process and outcome), it seemed reasonable to term it simply PositiveExpectations for Counseling. As shown in Table 2, Self-OrientedPerfectionism (describing standards set by and for the self) was positivelyand moderately related to the variate. Socially-Prescribed Perfectionism(describing feelings of pressure from demands placed on one bysignificant others) was moderately but negatively related to the variate;and Other-Oriented Perfectionism (describing expectations that othersshould be perfect) was unrelated to the variate. Because this configurationof dimensions so closely reflected previous characteristics of adaptiveperfectionism,itlikewise seemed reasonable to simply term theconfiguration Healthy Perfectionism. To summarize, canonical cor- relation analysis found asignificant relation between participants'Healthy Perfectionism and Positive Expectations for Counseling.DISCUSSIONIn summary, in this college student sample, the four-factor structurethatcharacterizedexpectations about counselingin two separateinvestigations did not emerge; although four factors could be extracted,they lacked psychological coherence. The fact that the four-factorstructure could not be replicated together with generally high internalconsistency of the individual sub-scales implied that individual sub-scaleswere the best units of analysis in this sample. Canonical correlationanalysis demonstrated that dimensions of perfectionism were significantlyrelated to facets of expectations. Perfectionism and expectations aboutcounseling cohered in a pattern that suggest that adaptive perfectionism,or healthy positive striving,is significantly associated with positiveexpectations for all facets of counseling, including expectations of theclient, the counselor, and the process and outcome of counseling.To some extent our results might be seen as the \"mirror image\" ofthose of Ey et al. (2000), who found that distressed medical and dentalstudents who failed to seek treatment had higher levels of socially-prescribed perfectionism and more negative attitudes toward mentalhealth services. By contrast, we found that healthy perfectionism,characterized by a large component of self-oriented perfectionism and anabsence of socially-prescribed perfectionism, was associated with pos-itive expectations about counseling. By extension, our results suggestthat the inverse of healthy perfectionism, characterized by a largecomponent of socially-prescribed perfectionism and an absence of self-oriented perfectionism, might be associated with negative expectationsabout counseling and that these negative expectations might, in turn,discourage students from seeking counseling. Oliver, Hart, Ross, KatzPERFECTIONISM & EXPECTATIONS 239 Our findings need to be qualified by the possibility that we may nothave sampled students with extremely high or extremely low levels ofperfectionism. Curvilinear associations between perfectionism and ex-pectations about counseling may occur in samples with more extremescores on either dimensions of perfectionism or facets of expectations ofcounseling.For example, it may be that some individuals who areextraordinarily perfectionistic have lower expectations of counseling; asample of clients actually beginning counseling may include individualswho are more perfectionistic and harbor lower expectations.It would be important to extend this investigation to samples of clientscurrently beginning counseling and/or on waiting lists at treatmentcenters. Such research might extend the range of perfectionism sampledand might help to clarify the nature of the relations among perfectionismand expectations about counseling at the upper ends of the ranges ofperfectionism and at both ends of expectations about counseling. Further,as suggested by Ey et al. (2000), help-seeking may in itself be related toeither of these variables.Our results obtained ina college sample suggest that amonguniversity undergraduates, who constitute a group generally selected forpsychological health and high motivation to achieve, there exists aconstructive, adaptive type of perfectionism, and that this healthyperfectionism is associated with positive expectations for counseling.Our results join other recent reports of students who harbor adaptiveperfectionism that has positive personality correlates. These resultssuggest that further research on perfectionism may find it productive todifferentiate between adaptive or healthy perfectionism and maladaptiveor neurotic perfectionism. They likewise suggest, following Ey et al.(2000), that it may be important for college personnel to understand thatcollege students who harbor maladaptive or neurotic perfectionism mayneed the encouragement of psycho-education. They may also requirepositive role modeling, and/or normalizing of treatment to overcome theirresistance to entering treatment if they become distressed. 240NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY REFERENCESAdler, A.

Attitudes Toward Perpetration of Sexual AbuseAgainst Children:A Study of Legal and Social Service OrientedStudentsScott A. Hubbartt and Sangeeta SinggAngelo State UniversityPrevious research has found attitudinal differences between legal and socialservice professionals regarding perpetration of sexual abuse againstchildren. The question explored in this study is \"Do these differencesdevelop before or after a person enters a profession?\" A sample of 192college men and women, between 18 and 21 years of age, completed theProfessional Attitudes Regarding Sexual Abuse of Children (PARSAC)Scale, which measured three factors: severity and seriousness of the issue,treatment versus punishment priority, and perpetrator identity. Based on a 2(legal and social service interests) x 2 (men and women) factorial analysisof variance, it was concluded that certain biases exist before individualsenter their careers dealing with perpetrators of child sexual abuse. Womenand men differed in their attitudes on all three factors, regardless of theirprofessional orientation. The legal and social service oriented studentsdiffered mainly intheirattitudes regarding the \"treatment versuspunishment\" issue about 1988; Trute, Adkins,& MacDonald, 1992; Wilk & McCarthy, 1986) have revealed thatattitudinal differences exist between legal and social service professionalstoward those who perpetrate sexual abuse against children, no study to datehas asked if these differences exist before individuals enter their professions.The major difference between the two types of professionals involves the\"retribution versus rehabilitation\" issue, legal service professionals viewingpunishment as more effective and social service professionals opting fortreatment ( (Craft alsoextends to sex differences (Attias & Goodwin, 1985; Deb linger, & Finkel, Owens, & Dewey, 1987; Wagner,Aucoin, & Johnson, 1993; Wellman, 1993). In general, female professionalstend to be pro-treatment, while male professionals tend to be pro-punishment.Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Sangeeta Singg, Departmentof Psychology and Sociology, Angelo State University, P. 0.

(1992) designed the Professional Attitudes Regarding theSexual Abuse of Children (PARSAC) Scale and compared three of the keyprofessional groups (police, child welfare, and community mental healthworkers) involved in the investigation and treatment of perpetrators of childsexual abuse. The PARSAC Scale measures three orthogonal factors.(1) Severity and seriousness of the issue refers to the belief that childsexual abuse is widespread and psychologically affects the victims. (2)Treatment versus punishment priority taps into the philosophical position onpunishment or treatment as the preferred intervention. (3) Perpetratoridentity involves the belief that anyone can abuse a child and thatperpetrators are not necessarily from deviant groups in society. Trute et al.(1992) found sex differences and differences between service sectors on allthree factors. They found that men (compared to women) and police officers(compared to human service professionals) were less inclined to regard thesexual abuse as a widespread or serious problem, were more pro-punishment, and were more likely to see perpetrators as socially deviantindividuals.The question raised here is \"Do the above attitudinal differences betweentwo types of professionals develop before or after a person enters a careerinvolving investigation/treatment of perpetrators of child sexual abuse?\" Inorder to examine any pre-professional attitudinal differences, we comparedyoung college men and women with future career interests in legal or socialservices. We also used the PARSAC Scale to measure three factors.Classification and age were controlled by using freshmen and sophomoresbetween 18 and 21 years, because they were considered naive regarding theprofessional biases of their future careers.In accordance with the study by Trute et al. (1992), we predicted that thesocial service orientation (SSO) group and women would have significantlyhigher mean scores (more lenient attitudes) than the legal service orientation(LSO) group and men on the three factors of the PARSAC Scale.Interactions between professional orientation and sex on the three factorswere also of interest.METHODParticipantsA sample of 192 freshmen and sophomores (men = 96, women = 96; Mage = 19.2, SD = .99) was obtained from a pool of 310 undergraduatesenrolled in 15 classes at a regional southwestern university. On the basis oftheir future career interests (social service/legal service) and sex, they weredivided into four groups: 49 SSO men, 54 LSO men, 47 SSO women, and42 LSO women. The subject pool was 59% women, 71% Euro-American,93% single, and 85% from middle class (self-reported). Hubbartt & SinggDEVELOPMENT OF ATTITUDES 245 InstrumentsThe PARSAC Scale contains 14 items that are answered on a four-pointLikert scale and measures professional attitudes regarding child sexual abuse(Trute et al., 1992). The three attitudinal domains measured by the PARSACare as follows. (1) Beliefs in regard to the extensiveness and seriousness ofthe issue has six items (alpha = .71). A representative item from thissubscale is \"The media has blown sexual abuse out of proportion.\" Thisfactor measures the tendency to see child sexual abuse as widespread andhaving important psychological impact on victims. (2) Treatment versuspunishment priority has five items (alpha = .72). A sample item from thissubscale is \"The most effective intervention for child sex offenders ispsychotherapy or counseling rather than jail.\" This factor measures thebeliefs regarding the most effective professional intervention to deal withperpetrators. (3) View regarding identity of those who perpetrate childsexual abuse has three items (alpha = .61). A representative item from thissubscale is \"Women rarely sexually molest children.\" This factor measuresthe recognition that anyone can perpetrate sexual abuse against a child.According to Trute et al. (1992), the PARSAC Scale addresses severalerroneous public beliefs such as child sexual abuse rarely occurs, onlysocially deviant individuals molest children, and the belief that professionalsare sensitive to the seriousness of child sexual abuse. This scale also tapsinto the current controversy concerning the most effective intervention toreduce sexually deviant acts of child molesters. A General InformationQuestionnaire (GIQ) containing demographic questions and questions aboutfuture career interest and college major was also used.ProcedureThestudentsfromthe15classesinthedepartmentsofpsychology/sociology, history, and government were contacted and theirvoluntary participation was solicited. They were briefed about the surveyand the careers under two orientations (e.g., legal service = police officers,lawyers, and probation officers; social service = counselors, child protectiveservice workers, and social workers). Those who were majoring in thesubjects they considered would lead to two types of careers were asked tocomplete the GIQ and PARSAC Scale. The goal was to obtain equal numberof men and women who met the classification and age criteria.RESULTSTables 1 and 2 present the results of the present study. As expected, theANOVA results showed a significant main effect of professional orientationon Factor 2 (treatment versus punishment), with SSO group showing a 246NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY significantly greater mean score (pro-treatment) than the LSO group.However, the main effects of professional orientation on Factor 1 (severityand seriousness) and Factor 3 (perpetrator identity) were not significant. Themain effects of sex were significant on all three factors, women showinghigher mean scores than men. No significant interaction between pro-fessional orientation and sex was found with regard to students' mean scoreson any of the three factors.TABLE 1 Mean Scores (Standard Deviations in italics) for Three PARSACScale Factors FactorOrientationSSOLSOTotalSeverity and SeriousnessMen19.9019.8919.902.902.202.56Women20.8220.9820.902.512.082.32Total20.3620.43Treatment and PunishmentMen11.169.9310.542.662.252.52Women11.7011.2411.472.202.392.29Total11.4310.582.432.40Perpetrator IdentityMen14.6514.5714.612.911.852.45Women15.3515.1715.261.752.201.96Total15.0014.872.392.03 DISCUSSIONBecause we wanted to compare the results of the present study ofstudents preparing for their careers with a methodologically similar study ofthe professionals by Trute et al. (1992), we discussed our findings inreference to findings of their study. They compared professionals who wereworking with perpetrators of child sex abuse. Also, the use of PARSACScale and samples coming from large rural areas in both studies make theresults more comparable.256 Hubbartt & SinggDEVELOPMENT OF ATTITUDES 247 Our findings differed from those of Trute et al. (1992) with regard to nosignificant differences between legal and social service oriented groups onfactors 1 and 3 (severity and seriousness of the issue and perpetratoridentity). However, we did find a significant difference between social andlegal service orientation groups on Factor 2 (treatment versus punishment),which is in line with the results by Trute et al. (1992). Interestingly, the sexdifferences were found on all three factors in both studies. TABLE 2 Analysis of Variance Results for Three PARSAC Scale FactorsVariable SSSeverity and .29.05Sex(B)47.597.86**A .14.03<.05; **p <.01 While Trute et al. (1992) found a significant difference between policeofficers and social service workers on Factor 1 (severity and seriousness).Their study included two groups of unequal size containing either mostlymen or mostly women. When they controlled for sex on Factor 1, theprofessional groups lost their statistically significant difference. Therefore, itmay be that both professionals and students are well aware of thewidespread nature of child sexual abuse in our society and of the importantpsychological impact it can have on victims.The present study and the study by Trute et al. (1992) coincided in theirfindings on Factor 2 (treatment versus punishment). One explanation why asignificant difference existed between professional orientation groups ofstudents on Factor 2 in the present study stems from Holland's (1997)vocational theory. Holland demonstrated that occupational personality typesexist and persons with certain social biases are attracted to certain careerpaths. They are products of their environments, which influence their 248NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY personal orientations and eventual career choices. Thus, persons bringcertain biases to their professions.Results for Factor 3 (perpetrator identity) in the present study imply thatboth the legal and social service orientation groups held similar views aboutthe family backgrounds and identity of child molesters. In other words, theyrecognized that anyone could perpetrate sexual abuse against a child andoffenders are not necessarily from a deviant group. This was not the case inthe study of professionals by Trute et al. (1992). Their study showed thatpolice officers identified perpetrators as coming from deviant sectors ofsociety. A logical explanation for our finding could be that the participantsin the present study were not closely involved with victims or perpetrators ofchild sexual abuse as were the police and social service workers in the Truteet al. (1992) study.Similar to the study by Trute et al. (1992), women in the present studyscored significantly higher than men on all three factors. This is consistentwith the findings of another recent study of students by Wellman (1993).The results for factor 1 (severity and seriousness) indicate that collegewomen consider child sexual abuse to be a more serious and prevalent issuethan do college men. This perception of college women concerning theserious nature of child sexual abuse may exist because when sexual abuseoccurs, the victims are mostly female (Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis, & Smith,1990). Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that during their youth, femalesmay be exposed to sexual abuse experiences more than males.Another reason could be that mens' views toward sex might bediminished by society's seeming approval of teenage boys who engage insexual intercourse with older women. When Broussard, Wagner, andKazelskis (1991) studied the impact of perpetrator's sex and victim's sex,the undergraduate college students viewed sexual intercourse of a femaleperpetrator (age 35) with a 15-year old male victim as less indicative ofchild sexual abuse.Briere and Runtz (1989) presented another possible explanation for whymen have less serious attitudes toward child sexual abuse. They collecteddata from a sample of 193 male undergraduate college students. Theirfindings suggested that sexual response to children may be more common inour society among men than we realize. Twenty-one percent admitted beingsexually attracted to some small children (the age range of small childrenwas not specified). Nine-percent reported fantasizing about having sex witha child and 5% admitted to masturbating at least once to such fantasies.Seven-percent of the students indicated some likelihood of engaging in sexwith a child if they could avoid detection or punishment. Findings of thisnature are very alarming, and such studies need to be replicated.253 Hubbartt & SinggDEVELOPMENT OF ATTITUDES 249 In line with the study by Trute et al. (1992), the results of the presentstudy showed that college women tend to have less punitive attitudes towardsex offenders than men (Factor 2, treatment versus punishment). Thisattitude may reflect the female nurturing and caretaking role in our society.Again, in keeping with Trute et al. (1992), men seemed to accept themyth that child sexual abuse occurs infrequently and is initiated by sociallyabnormal individuals (Factor 3, perpetrator identity). This belief may existas a form of denial on the part of men, because the majority of sex offendersare male (Finkelhor et al., 1990). Furthermore, Finkelhor et al. and otherresearchers (Bolen, 2000; Cupoli & Sewell, 1988) have shown that a maleperpetrator is usually a member of the family or someone known to the childand is rarely a stranger (the traditional stereotype). If a man was to acceptthat perpetrators are from the normal population, this may in part be apersonal attack on his dignity, indicating that he is also capable of beingconnected to this ominous subgroup.Some limitations of the present study are worth noting. Some possibleintervening variables were not controlled, such as exposure to informationabout child sexual abuse, possible child sexual abuse history of theparticipants, and ethnicity. Also, career interests of students could be subjectto change as they progress in college. There was no measure of how stronglya student was interested in the social or legal service type of profession.The findings of the present study suggest that young men and womendiffer in their attitudes toward perpetration of sexual abuse against children,regardless of their professional orientation. Thus, the sex difference mightbe a function of various belief systems that also influence people intochoosing different career paths. This difference develops before individualsenter their careers. Therefore, it may be fair to include a balance of male andfemale jurors when there is a decision to be made as to what should be donewith a perpetrator of child sexual abuse.The only difference between the professional orientation groups in thepresent study has to do with the issue of \"retribution versus rehabilitation.\"The implication is that this difference does not develop after one joins eitherof the two professional groups described here; rather it may pre-exist,indicating certain personal characteristics of people that group them intodifferent pre-occupational types. For more objectivity and later cohesiveeffort of communication among professionals, maybe these differencesshould be addressed during the training programs in college. What to dowith the perpetrators of child sexual abuse is just as serious an issue as theabuse itself. It deserves attention from all relevant professional sectors sothat the most effective measures can be taken to treat the source of theproblem, the perpetrator. If the leaders and professionals of our society do 250NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY not seriously focus on this aspect of the problem, the cause of the problemwill never be targeted. Abel and Rouleau (1995, p. 150) clearly expressedthis point of view when they concluded that \"the path to no victims is to treatthe perpetrators.\" REFERENCESAbel, G. G. & Rouleau, J. L. (1995).

Self-protective Pessimism: Optimistic Bias inReverseJohn ChapinPenn State University - BeaverOver 100 published studies in the past 20 years confirm the presence ofunrealistic optimism in a variety of contexts, particularly health riskperception. This study used optimistic bias measures to consider theeffect of pessimism on health risk perception and risk-taking behaviors.The findings of a survey of a suburban community sample indicate thatstudy participants exhibited pessimistic bias regarding the likelihood ofreaching theirlifegoals, and thatthis pessimism was linked toage/experience. Younger participants tended to exhibit a pessimistic viewof the future, which in turn appears to encourage certain risk-takingbehaviors, including alcohol abuse, vehicular speeding, unprotectedsexual activity, and cigarette smoking.Weinstein (1980) coined the phrase \"optimistic bias\" to describe thecommon misperception that \"bad things happen to other people, but notto me.\" Weinstein argued that individuals make comparative riskassessments in an egocentric manner, paying little attention to the riskstatus of others when asked to determine their own relative risk. In layterms, individuals believe they are less vulnerable to risks than others.Optimistic bias is a robust finding and has been replicated in a varietyof contexts, including HIV/AIDS risk (Ellen, Boyer, Tschann & Shafer,1996; Harris, 1996), sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk (Kaplan &Shayne, 1993; Turner, 1993), pregnancy risk (Eldridge, Lawrence, Little,Shelby & Brasfield, 1995; Smith, Gerrard, & Gibbons, cancer Febaughty, West, Johnson, & Luckett, 1995; Fontaine & (Strecher, substance abuserisk (Hansen, Raynor, & Wolkenstein, 1991; Miller, (Glanz & Yang, 1996; Hoorens, 1996).While the concept of optimistic bias has generated a great deal ofresearch, only one study (Sultan & Bureau, 1999) considered anotherpossibility... pessimistic bias. What effect does a pessimistic viewpointhave on risk-perception and attitudes? Do those who believe they areespecially pronetonegative outcomes take more self-protectiveprecautions or passively accept their fate? The purpose of the currentstudy is to apply knowledge gained through the optimistic bias literatureAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. John Chapin, Penn State U.,110 Michael Baker Bldg., Monaca, PA 15061.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 253-262.NAJP 254NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY to a pessimistic sample, thereby gaining insight on health risk-perceptionand risk-taking behaviors.Over 100 studies published since 1980 confirm the presence ofoptimistic bias and explore the impact of such misperceptions onindividuals (see Weinstein 1987, 1989 for reviews). The over-reliance oncollege student samples in optimistic bias research has been critiquedfrequently (Weinstein, 1987, p. 483):College students are a biased sample of the population in other respects.They are likely to be healthier, to become better educated, and to comefrom wealthier homes than the average person their age. Thus, they maybe correct when they claim that their chances of experiencing harm areless than average (p. 483).Weinstein (1987) sought to control for this bias by conducting aphone survey of residents of a community in New Jersey. He still foundoptimistic bias regarding a variety of health risks, including drugaddiction,attemptedsuicide,senility,diabetes, and gum disease.Unfortunately, this \"community sample\" excluded anyone under the ageof 18. Chapin's (2000) study of New Jersey youth found adolescents tobe equally (if not more) optimistic by comparison with previous samples,especially regarding sexual risks. The critique of the over-reliance oncollege students is valid. If adolescents tend to be more optimistic thancollege students regarding health risks, then age may be positivelycorrelated with pessimism.Weinstein (1982,1987) concedes that experience has great influenceon optimistic bias. Individuals use past experiences to predict their futurevulnerability, mistakenly believing that if it hasn't happened yet, it won'thappen:Such a belief may arise when people believe the problem has ahereditary basis and will appear early in life if it is going to appear atall (e.g. juvenile diabetes and asthma). In other cases (e.g., tooth decay)people believe that vulnerability is a constitutional matter, so if theproblem has not appeared, their bodies must be resistant. Furthermore,some problems may seem to be caused by one's behavior or personality(e.g., obesity and drug addiction), and people may conclude that theabsence of a problem at their age means they do not have the weaknessof character that allows it to develop (Weinstein, 1987, p. 484).Numerous studies confirm a link between experience and optimisticbias (McCoy, Gibbons, Gerrard, & Suftka, 1992; Moore & Rosenthal,1991). Age alone, then, may fail to predict optimistic bias, depending onthe outcome of experiences. If an individual speeds frequently, but failsto get a ticket, that individual is likely to be optimistic that he/she has a2 6 3 ChapinSELF-PROTECTIVE PESSIMISM 255 special ability to avoid police, and will continue to speed. On the otherhand, if a person speeds frequently and receives numerous tickets, wouldhe or she become pessimistic, now believing that he/she is some sort of\"police magnet?\"While the influence of unrealistic optimism on health outcomes andrisk-behaviors has been broadly investigated, less is known about thoseprone to pessimism. Norem (1986) argued that anxiety is used as apersonal motivator. Results of Norem's experiment indicated that pes-simism (in the form of low expectations) coupled with high anxietynegativelyimpactindividualperceptions when faced withriskysituations. Likewise, Donegal (1999) found pessimism to be predictiveof performance deterioration and accuracy in experimental tasks. Othersconfirm a link between pessimism and failure (Mikolajczyk, 1999) andimpaired judgment (Keltner, 1993).The first study to use Weinstein's (1980) optimistic bias instrument toexamine pessimism found \"unrealistic optimism\" to be a correlate ofdispositional optimism (Sultan & Bureau, 1999). A respondent's place ona continuum between optimism and pessimism was found to predictvulnerability appraisals regarding sexual risk-taking situations. Highlyoptimistic students believed they were less vulnerable to sexual risks,while highly pessimistic students believed they were more prone tosexual risks. Sultan and Bureau sought to link the pessimism literature tothe optimistic bias literature; however, their findings suggest a littlepessimism may be a healthy thing. The current study sought to extendthese findings by avoiding the biases inherent in the overuse of collegestudent samples and through the use of multiple risk-behaviors.Based on the literature I hypothesized that the persons in the presentsample would be less likely than other people their age in the U.S. tobelieve they would reach their life goals (pessimistic bias). Furthermore,pessimistic bias will increase as age increases, and as pessimistic biasincreases, the number of risks taken will decrease. Finally, as pessimisticbias increases, the frequency of risks will decrease.METHODParticipantsParticipants were randomly selected from several communities inAllegheny County, Pennsylvania. Allegheny County suffers one of thehighest poverty rates in Pennsylvania (21%), with an average per capitaincome of $15,115 (Bureau of the Census, 1994). Pittsburgh is one ofonly four American cities that experienced population loss in the 1990s.The largely Euro-American (87%) population (African-Americans = 11%) reside in urban (96%) or suburban environments in or nearPittsburgh (Pennsylvania State Data Center, 1999). The Pittsburgh area 256NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY provides an ideal location for this study. One hundred sixty two residentsanonymously completed the survey instrument for a nominal payment.The sample was somewhat skewed, over-representing females (61%) andEuro-Americans (99%) ranging in age from 14 to 78 (M = 34.9, SD =16.1).ProcedureHouseholds were randomly selected from local telephone directories.People who received calls were informed about the survey and asked ifthey and/or other members of the household (ages 14 and up) wouldparticipate. Calls continued until 200 individuals agreed to have surveysmailed to their home (23% success rate). Of the individuals who agreedto participate by phone, 81% (162) completed consent forms and surveysand returned them by mail.MeasuresOptimistic bias regarding health risks was measured with a standardinstrument designed by Weinstein (1980). The procedure asked par-ticipants to compare their relative risk of four target variables (vehicleaccident, AIDS, STD, cancer), with \"other people my age in the U.S.\"Comparative risk assessment was measured on a 7-point scale (-3 =\"much less\" than other students in the USA, +3 = \"much greater\" thanother students in the USA). Optimistic bias was indicated by a groupmean significantly less than zero, and pessimistic bias by a group meansignificantly greater than zero. A mean of zero indicated no bias. On Table One these four were combined to yield one score called\"pessimism: health risks.\"Pessimistic bias regarding life goals was measured with a similarinstrument, which replaced the target risk with a positive statement:\"Compared to other people my age in the U.S., my chances of reachingmy life goals are...\" The same response scale was used; however, thescale was reversed for consistency across the optimism and pessimismmeasures. In Table One this is called \"pessimism: life goals.\"Consistent with previous reviews (Weinstein, 1987), the optimisticbias instrument is highly reliable (a = .88); however, two threats tovalidity have been suggested. Because young people are more likelythan older people to believe the future will be better than the present, theoveruse of college student samples is problematic. The second threat tovalidity is the failure to measure \"actual risk.\" The current studyaddressed the first concern by utilizing a community-based sample. Allattempts at measuring one individual's \"actual risk\" of a particular risk(i.e. contracting a STD from unprotected sex) ultimately fail, becausethey must rely on percentages and estimates. Couching discussion of ChapinSELF-PROTECTIVE PESSIMISM 257 optimism/pessimism at the group level minimizes, but doesn't eliminate,the threat to validity.In addition to demographic information (age, gender, geographiclocation), individuals self-reported the age of initiation of sexual activity.Several domains of risk behavior were measured using an instrumentadapted from Arnett (1996). Participants indicated past risk by reportingwhether they had ever done any of the following: smoked cigarettes, hadunprotected sex (without a condom), had protected sex (with a condom),driven 10-miles over the speed limit. Present risk was measured byasking participants to estimate the number of days they had engaged ineach of the four risk-behaviors in the past 30 days. Five responsecategories were provided: none, 1-2 days, 3-10 days, 11-20 days, almostevery day.RESULTSHypothesis 1 predicted pessimistic bias among the respondents. Thepositive mean (M = .69, SD = 1.4) indicated that study participantsexhibited the tendency to believe they were less likely than other peopletheir age in the U.S. to achieve their life goals. A single-sample-t-test wasused to test the hypothesis that the mean of pessimism was significantlygreater than zero. As predicted in H1, participants exhibited pessimisticbias, t (161) = 6.2, p< .001.Table 1 Zero-Order Correlations Pessimistic Bias and StudyVariables 2341.

Aspredicted in H2, pessimistic bias was related to age, at least for life goals;however, the relationship was in the opposite direction. Pessimismappears to decrease with age. Weinstein (1989) argues that optimistic 258NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY bias decreases with direct experience with a target variable; i.e. if onedrinks and drives and experiences a negative consequence (an accident),one becomes less optimistic about avoiding accidents while under theinfluence. Perhaps in this case, participants in Allegheny County beganwith low expectations regarding the future and became more optimisticwith age as they experienced positive outcomes (success).Hypotheses 3 and 4 explored the effect of pessimism on current andpast risk behaviors. As predicted in H3, an inverse relationship appearedbetween life goals pessimistic bias and the number of health risks taken(alcohol consumption, speeding, unprotected sex, and cigarette smoking).People who are pessimistic about achieving their life goals take fewertypes of risks than optimistic people. TABLE 2 Summary of Linear Regression Analysis for VariablesPredicting Pessimistic Bias PredictorPessimistic bias **p< .01. Standard multiple regression was used to identify the best predictorsof pessimistic bias. The results are displayed in Table 2. Analysis ofresidual plots indicates that assumptions regarding normality, linearity,and homoscedasticity were met. Both age and experience (number ofrisks experienced) remained in the model. Age was the best predictor ofpessimistic bias, with pessimistic bias decreasing with age. While theresultsSuggest changes incurrently held assumptions about op-timistic/pessimistic bias, the results of this analysis should be interpretedwith caution due to the low adjusted r-square.DISCUSSIONContrary to H4, no relationship was found between pessimistic bias and the frequency of the four risk behaviors during the past 30-dayperiod. It is interesting to note, however, that frequency of risks was?67 ChapinSELF-PROTECTIVE PESSIMISM 259 significantly related to the number of life goal risks. This suggests theneed for further exploration of the relationship between pessimistic biasand risk behaviors, and also lends support to Jessor and Jessor's (1977)argument that \"problem behaviors\" should be studied in groups, becauseindividuals tend to engage in multiple risk behaviors simultaneously.The intercorrelations on Table 1 among the four risk behaviors alsosupport this conclusion.Optimistic bias is a robust finding. Over 100 published studies in 20years confirm the presence of unrealistic optimism in a variety ofcontexts, particularly health risk perception. This study is only the secondto use optimistic bias measures to consider the effect of pessimism onhealthrisk perception and risk-taking behaviors. The study alsocontributes to the literature by avoiding the over-reliance on collegestudent samples by focusing on an urban community ranging in age from14 to 78.The findings indicate that study participants exhibited pessimisticbias regarding the likelihood of reaching their life goals, and that thispessimism was linked to age/experience. Younger participants tended toexhibit a fatalistic view of the future, which in turn appears to discouragecertainrisk-takingbehaviors,includingalcoholabuse,vehicularspeeding, unprotected sexual activity, and cigarette smoking. Thesebehaviors in particular have been associated with adolescents who exhibithigh degrees of optimistic bias (Chapin, 2000). This finding seems tosuggest that a little self-protective pessimism may promote healthychoices and behaviors. As individuals experience success, the degree ofpessimistic bias tends to decline, yielding a more optimistic outlook (insome cases unrealistically so), and the adoption of more risky habits.Such findings are hopeful in that they suggest a strategy for healthcampaigns that emphasize personal risk over high-risk groups andnational statistics.People who believe they are prone to negativeoutcomes can and do take precautions. Building on the existing literature,the results of this study indicate that people who take health risks tend totake multiple risks and take them more frequently.The optimism/pessimism continuum presents a promising frameworkfor understanding how people process health risk information, whichpeople are prone to risk-taking behaviors, and how to encourage peopleto adopt self-protective behaviors. The use of a single measureencompassing the continuum would clarify relationships suggested in thecurrent study, and may be more applicable to specific risk behaviors.Futureresearchcouldalsoemphasizetheformationofopti-mistic/pessimistic bias and explore methods of priming either responsethrough health promotion campaigns. 260NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY While the results of the current study are based on a random sample, itintentionallyover-representsurbanitesandsuburbanitesinaneconomically depressed geographic area. It also over-represents Euro-Americans. Most optimistic bias studies, which included items about lifegoals, found people to be unrealistically optimistic about the future. Thismay be due to the over-reliance on college student samples of previousstudies; however, one study does not provide a basis for drawingconclusions about the source of optimism or pessimism regarding thefuture.

STEPHEN BRIDGESC. BENNETT WILLIAMSONPAUL C. THOMPSONMARGARET A. WINDSORThe University of West FloridaOf 840 letters \"lost\" in the Florida Panhandle, 467 (55.6%) were returnedinthemail by thefinders(thealtruisticresponse).Addressees'affiliations were associated with significantly different rates of return;fewer emotive Advocates for Battered and Abused Lesbians (ABAL)addressees were returned than controls. Hierarchical loglinear modelswere utilized to uncover the complex relationships between geographiclocation (Ohio and Florid/Alabama), community size (city and town),addressee affiliation (controls and emotive homosexual affiliate) andreturned response(returned and notreturned). The resultsweresignificant and suggest that letters were more likely to be returned if theywere: lost in Ohio than in Florida/Alabama; lost in a city rather than in asmall town; addressed to control affiliates than emotive lesbian ones; orwere addressed to a person than an organization. These findings appear tosupport the basic premise of Milgram's lost letter technique, namely, thatthe probability of lost letters being returned depends on the social andpolitical attributes of the addressees' affiliations.Persons asked to complete surveys or participate in interviews oftenrecognize that their responses will be studied. Participants may haveconcern about how they are evaluated which can in turn have a strongeffect on what they say, especially regarding socially and politicallysensitive subjects. Researchers recognized this problem and developedanother way of measuring community attitudes, the lost letter technique.They reported this technique to be useful as a research tool for measuringpublic sentiment toward political organizations, including deviant ones(Milgram, Mann, and Harter, 1965). These researchers addressedstamped letters to fictitious persons and groups and dispersed a largenumber of them in public places. It was assumed that a passerby wouldeither ignore the letter, respond to it, but not take it, or pick it up and takeAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: F.

Presumably, the attitude ofthe finder toward the particular addressee (person or group) might affect this decision. Thus, the dependent variable was the number of \"lost\"letters returned in the mail. Milgram (1970) hypothesized that in cities people help others less often than in small towns. Other researchers tested this hypothesis and addressed letters to fictitious persons whodiffered in evident conformity to conventional social norms (Hansson & Slade, 1977; Whitehead & Metzger, 1981). Neither study found adifference in the urban rate of return of lost letters regardless of whether the addressee was deviant, whereas from small towns fewer lost letterswere returned if the addressee was deviant.The willingness of Americans to extend civil liberties to any number of unpopular groups has interested social scientists for many years. Hunter (1987) wrote about the ever-increasing cultural polarization ofAmerican society since the mid-1970s. For about fifty years, the research has shown Southerners to be more reluctant than non-southerners toextend civil liberties to various unpopular groups 1987; Wilson, 1986). Low levels of tolerance (i.e., the lack of willingness to extend civil liberties todeviant groups) continue to persist in the south due in part to protestant fundamentalism (Borg, 1997; Ellison & Musick, 1993). In Nunn,Crockett, and Williams's (1978) study (as cited in Ellison & Musick, 1993) the south, as a regional subculture, was unfavorably characterizedas follows: \"Localism, defined as a marked preference for and identitywith the locale of one's birth, is joined in the South with an insularity of mind that is slow to change, actively belligerent toward the new, andopenly intolerant toward a diversity of viewpoints.\" (p. 380). Surveys ofpublic opinion in the 1980s showed widespread fear of AIDS, with muchinaccurate information about how the disease is spread, and a public willingness to support Draconian policies that would restrict civil liberties for the purpose of battling the disease (Herek, 1999). Herek (1999) defined AIDS-related stigma as \"prejudice, discounting, dis-crediting, and discrimination directed at people perceived to have AIDSor HIV, and the individuals, groups, and communities with which theyare associated\" (p.1103). Historically in America, symbolic AIDSstigma has focused primarily on male homosexuality, and manyAmericans continue to equate AIDS with this sexual orientation (Herek, 1999; Herek & Capitanio, 1999).\"Person-positivity\" bias is the general tendency to evaluate any individual social objects, not just self, more positively than groups orcollections of individuals (aggregates) (Sears, 1983). It is based on Sears' (1983) three assumptions about the uniqueness of persons as objects Bridges, Williamson, Thompson, & Windsor BATTERING 265 evoking attitudes (e.g., animate objects such as people ranging toinanimate ones, like rocks or a desert) and why they attract relativelymore positive response from other persons. First, all objects evokingattitudes could be conceptualized as representing different points on a\"personhood\" dimension, with specific individuals at one end, collectionsof individuals(aggregates)in the middle, and group stereotypessomewhere between aggregates and inanimate objects at the otherimpersonal end. In fact, even animals and other beings can vary a lot onthis \"personhood\" dimension, i.e., machines and animal characters inchildren's stories were evaluated more positively when given humannames than when identified in the usual nonhuman manner. Thus, thecharacterization of the dimension as \"personhood\" stresses the concept ofsimilarity between any given object and a human person (Sears, 1983).Secondly, Sears (1983) assumed that the more an object resembles aperson, the more evaluators will perceive its similarity to themselves, andthe more favorably it would be evaluated. But he noted that even groupsor aggregates can vary a lot on the \"personhood\" dimension: forexample, group objects that bring to mind ordinary persons, to whom anevaluator might feel more similar, would be evaluated more positivelythan group objects that characterize an abstract type. Kaplan (1976) hadnoted the universal existence of a preference for a \"positivity\" bias for\"people in general,\" but he also indicated that marked individualdifferences exist. Sears' (1983) third assumption is that generalizedattitudes toward different objects on the \"personhood\" dimension tend tobe compartmentalized, even when they seemed to be closely related toeach other.In sum, the general tendency to evaluate persons morepositively than groups is because similarity enhances liking (Berscheid &Walster, 1978; Byrne, 1971). Sears (1983) and his colleagues (Sears,Brown, & Ditto,1982; Sears & Whitney, 1973) used this well-documented relationship between similarity and liking to explain whyevaluations of social groups (e.g., politicians in general) are often lesspositive than evaluations of specific individual members of those groups(e.g., specific US Senators).Some researchers (Milgram, et al., 1965; Simmons & Zumpf, 1983;Wicker, 1969) have reported a higher rate of return for personal lettersthan for those letters addressed to political groups and other institutions.In addition, higher rates of return were reported for lost letters addressedto: 1) a person rather than letters addressed to a person(s) \"in care of agroup(s) (Bridges & Coady, Hansson & Slade, 1977;Whitehead & Metzger, 1981), 2) a person than to a group's namefollowed underneath by \"Attention to: person's name\" (Weiner, 1975), 3)a person than those letters addressed to a person \"in care of a political7 3 266NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY group. These in turn had a higher rate of return than those lettersaddressed to political groups (Jacoby & Aranoff, 1971). Simmons and Zumpf (1983) offered Sears' hypotheses as a reasonable explanation fortheir higher return rate across conditions (kinds of addressees) for lost letters addressed to individual persons rather than to groups (e.g.,committees) and for their high overall rates of return of letters.Sears (1983) explained that the reason why machines and animal characters with human names were evaluated more positively was because the application of names changed their positions on the\"personhood\" dimension. We applied this concept by adding a person'sname to addresses for lost letter return, so as to influence the position ofthe groups' stereotypes on the \"personhood\" dimension, thereby allowingthem to be evaluated more favorably. Drawing from the work of Sears (1983) and Jacoby and Aranoff (1971) the present experiment sought touse a person-positivity effect, i.e., more letters are returned when they are addressed to a 'person in care of a group' than to a just a 'group', to improve upon the lost letter technique as a method for assessingcommunity responses about a somewhat political issue. We predicted,after considering Kaplan's work and his modification of Sears' similarityhypothesis, that any \"person-positivity\" effect should produce both ahigher return rate across kinds of addressees for lost letters addressed toa 'person in care of a group' than to a 'group' alone and a higher overallrate of return of letters.The purposes of this study were to: (1) determine if there is a sig-nificant relationship among return response (letter returned/not returned),geographic location, community size, and addressee affiliation forresidents of cities and small towns in Ohio, Florida, and Alabama, (2) to determine to what extent the variables (addressee affiliation or geo- graphic location or community size) influence return rate, and (3) to determine if\"person-positivity\" would influence return rates of lostletters.METHODLost LettersThe present study modified previous designs of others (Bridges, 1996; Bridges, Anzalone, & Anzalone, unpublished) by adding new affiliations for addressees and by adding other conditions such ascommunity size, person-positivity effect, and geographic location. The affiliates for two of the addressees were designed to represent groups thatin the South do not arouse very high levels of emotional involvement. Incontrast, the affiliate for the third addressee was designed to represent anunpopular and often stigmatized homosexual group. Thus, the affiliationswere renamed either Advocates for Battered and Abused Women Bridges, Williamson, Thompson, & Windsor BATTERING 267 (ABAW), Advocates for Battered and Abused Men (AB AM), andAdvocates for Battered and Abused Lesbians (AB AL). The geographiclocation allowed comparison of the lost letter technique at two culturallyand geographically different test sites. The city of Pensacola in Floridaand surrounding small towns in adjacent Alabama are culturallydissimilar to the city of Lima and the nearby small towns of Ada andKenton which are located far away in the northwestern corner of Ohio.The culturaldifferences between these geographic locations, i.e.,Southern versus Northern, might influence response to addressees'affiliations and return of lost letters. Thus, the geographic locationcondition referred to whether a lost letter was dropped in the South in thecity of Pensacola, Florida and surrounding small towns in adjacentAlabama or in the North in the city of Lima, Ohio and in nearby smalltowns of Ada and Kenton. The \"person-positivity\" condition referred towhether a lost letter was addressed to a \"person in care of a group\" or justa \"group.\"ProcedureTwo field experiments used 840 \"lost letters.\" In the first experiment,a total of 540 lost letters, i.e., either 50 letters (only 40 for small towns)for each of three affiliations for addressees in two sizes of communityand for two conditions that manipulated \"person-positivity,\" weredistributed in public places in Florida and Alabama: 300 in the city ofPensacola (population = 60,600) and 240 in 22 small towns, boroughs,and communities based on the US Postal Service mail delivery inBaldwin County, Alabama (M populations = 6,713). In the secondexperiment, a total of 300 lost letters, i.e., either 25 letters for each ofthree affiliations for addressees in two sizes of community and for twoconditions that manipulated \"person-positivity,\" were distributed inpublic places in Ohio: 150 letters within the city limits of Lima(population = 45,550) and 150 within the city limits of Ada and Kenton(M populations = 6,713). Public places included in the aisles of stores,on frequently used sidewalks next to major thoroughfares, in and aroundphone booths and automatic (bank) teller machines. The content of theletters in both studies indicated that a $250 contribution was available ifsomeone from one of the respective committees would drop by and pickit up. The name Francis S. Bridges and a residential Pensacola, Floridaaddress was used for the portion of the study conducted in Florida andAlabama and the name Margaret A. Windsor and a Post Office Boxaddress in Lima, Ohio was used for the portion of the study conducted inOhio. The names of addresses could not be the same in the two fieldexperiments because a valid driver's license is checked by name as arequirement to rent a Post Office Box, and experience has shown that75 268NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY using a name other than the one used to rent the Box may cause deliveryproblems. Thus, half of the envelopes were addressed to either Francis S.Bridges or Margaret A. Windsor in care of (the) Advocates for Batteredand Abused Women (ABAW), Francis S. Bridges or Margaret A.Windsor in care of Advocates for Battered and Abused Men (ABAM),and Francis S. Bridges or Margaret A. Windsor in care of Advocates forBattered and Abused Lesbians (ABAL); the rest of the envelopes simplyaddressed to these groups. \"Francis S. Bridges or Margaret A. Windsor\" were used as the name portion of the `person(s) in care of a group'condition and the Advocates for Battered and Abused Women (ABAW),Advocates for Battered and Abused Men (ABAM), and Advocates for Battered and Abused Lesbians (ABAL) affiliates were used as the`groups' in both types of addresses.Research Design and Statistical AnalysisThe research design used a hierarchical log linear model (Kinnear &Gray, 2001) to examine both (1) the complex relationships betweenaddresseeaffiliation(emotive/control),communitysize(city/smalltowns), geographic location (Ohio/Florida and Alabama), and return response (returned/not returned), and (2) the structure present in acontingency table. Chi-squared goodness:of-fit testing confirmed theimprovements in the fit of the hierarchical log linear model after addingcombinations of interactions. Follow-up chi-squared analyses were used to examine (1) the interactions among the variables of addresseeaffiliation and geographic location on return response to a lost letter.Yates' corrected chi-squared was computed for all 2 x 2 tables.Statistical power for the chi-square analysis used in this study wascalculated using The Program, by Glantz (1997). All differences were significant at p < .05 or beyond.RESULTSThere was significant interaction for geographic location by returnresponse [X2 (N = 840) = 38.32, p < .001, effect size = .21] indicating thatthe overall returned responses of lost letters differed across geographiclocation and return response categories regardless of condition. Residentsof Ohio (70.0%) had a higher percentage of letters returned than residentsof Florida and Alabama (47.6%). The rates in each condition are depicted in Tables 1 and 2. 276 Bridges, Williamson, Thompson, & Windsor BATTERING 269 TABLE 1Number & Percent of Letters Returned in Ohio as aFunction of Affiliation of Addressee, Battered and Abused LesbianstABAW = Advocates for Battered and Abused WomentABAM = Advocates for Battered and Abused Men There was significant interaction for community size by returnresponse [X2 (N = 840) = 21.53, p < .001, effect size = .16] indicating thatthe overall returned responses of lost letters differed across communitysize and return response categories regardless of condition. City residents(63.1%) had a higher percentage of letters returned than residents ofsmall towns (46.9%).There was a significant interaction for addressee affiliation by returnresponse [X2 (N = 840) = 23.42, p < .001, effect size = .17] indicating thatreturned responses of lost letters differed between addressee affiliationsand return response categories. Letters addressed to Advocates forBattered and Abused Women (ABAW) (62.5%) were returned moreoften than those letters addressed to Advocates for Battered and AbusedMen (ABAM)(60.4%) or Advocates for Battered and Abused Lesbians(ABAL) (43.9%). Since there was significant variation across kinds of 270NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY TABLE 2 Number & Percent of Letters Returned in Florida & Alabamaas a Function of Affiliation of for Battered and Abused LesbianstABAW = Advocates for Battered and Abused WomentABAM = Advocates for Battered and Abused Men addressees' affiliations in the overall rates of return, a contingency tablewas subdivided to compare Advocates for Battered and Abused Women(ABAW) and Advocates for Battered and Abused Men (ABAM)affiliates [X2 (N = 560) = .19, ns, effect size = .02]. The returns for theseaffiliates were pooled and compared to those returns of the Advocates forBattered and Abused Lesbian (ABAL) affiliate. Consequently, ad-dressees' affiliation was significantly associated with overall rates ofreturn [X2 (N = 840) = 22.45, p < .001, effect size = .16], with the rates ofreturn being the lowest (61.4% vs. 43.9%) for the homosexual affiliate.The manipulation of the \"person-positivity\" condition was signif-icantly associated with different rates of return [X2 (N = 840) = 12.09, p<.001, effect size = .12]. There was a significantly larger percentage of lost letters (61.9% vs. 49.8%) associated with returns addressed to `person in care of a group' (i.e., Francis S. Bridges and Margaret A. Windsor in care of a group) than those addressed to `group(s)' (i.e.,ABAW, ABAM, ABAL).2 8 Bridges, Williamson, Thompson, & Windsor BATTERING 271 DISCUSSIONTrying to come up with two fictitious control conditions withdifferentgoals,i.e.,Advocates for Battered and Abused Women(ABAW) and Advocates for Battered and Abused Men (ABAM), afterselectingasuitableexperimental condition was adifficulttask.Therefore, the addressee affiliation by return response analyses werefollowed with simple comparisons (initially pooling the ABAW andABAM conditions) because we could not be sure that public attitudeswere not evoked through the use of either one of these affiliates, say forexample, in persons angry with their local Shelter for Battered Women.The log linear results suggest that geographic location, communitysize, addressee affiliation, and response rate were not independent, andthus, independence does not adequately explain the structure that isinherent in the contingency table. The two-way interaction model(addresseeaffiliation-returnresponse,geographiclocation-returnresponse, community size-return response, and geographic location-community size) was adequate to represent the data. Examination of thetwo-way interaction term of geographic location-community size was theonly effect that was found to be non-significant. The finding of asignificant difference in response rate for these four variables suggeststhat the impact of addressee affiliation, geographic location, \"person-positivity\" and community size appears to account for most of thesedifferences.The finding of a significant difference associated with return responsefor the three addressee affiliations appear to support in part, the basicpremise of Milgr, am's (1970) lost letter technique: namely, that theprobability of lost letters being returned depends on the social andpolitical attributes of letters' affiliations, i.e., addressees' affiliations.Milgram (1969) concluded \"The lost letter technique is not very good forsubtle issues, or in connection with issues that do not arouse very strongfeelings.It only works for issues in where there is clear-cut polarization,and which arouse a high level of emotional involvement\" (p. 264). As tothe limitations of the lost letter technique being less likely to make finedistinctions (in our Southern and Northern cities), it seems that ouranalysis, like that of Waugh's et al. (2000) gay marriage analysis, wasnot too subtle a distinction for the technique. Our findings from mid-sizecities, not towns, are consistent with some studies of public attitudestoward homosexuals and other issues of sexual orientation, but notconsistent with others. One of these studies (Bridges & Rodriguez, 2000)showed no difference in the rate of returned lost letters within a city,whereas five others (Bridges, 1996, Bridges, Welsh, Graves, & Sonn,1997; Bridges, Anzalone, & ,Plake, & Rienzi, 2000) reported fewer 272NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY lost letters returned froma city for any addressee that was clearlyassociated with a homosexual group or represented other issues of sexual orientation.The finding of a significant difference associated with return response for residents of the cities and small towns suggests that community sizehad an impact on returnresponses. It was expected that as the size of thecommunities' populations decreased, there would be an increase in the returned responses; however, returned responses from the cities was higher than that of the small towns. The present finding does not agreewith Milgram's (1970) hypothesis that people in small towns help others more often than those in cities. However, unlike previous lost letterstudies, recent studies tested Milgram's (1970) hypothesis of rural-urbandifferences by statistically analyzing returns from the different sizes of community. They found that urban communities had higher rates of helping (e.g., returned significantly more lost letters) than did less populated beach and rural communities (Bridges & Rodriguez 2000; Bridges, Thompson, & Willers, 2000). Thus, our findings suggest thepossibility that there may besome community bias in the willingness ofpeople to help some strangers. That is, regardless of the address on a lost letter, a stranger in need ismore likely to have a letter returned fromcities than from small towns.The reason(s) why residents of the North were more helpful in returning lostletters than residents of the South is unclear. One possibilityisthat the researchers who \"lost\" lettersin the Southunintentionally made them more difficult to find than the researcher who \"lost\" them in the North. Even when the emotive ABAL affiliation was removed from the contingency table, there were larger numbers andpercentages of lost letters associated with the geographic North than withthe Southern locations (p < .05).The \"person-positivity\" condition was significantly associated with returned responses for the three addressees' affiliations. These findingsare consistent with (Simmons & Zumpf (1983), as our letter return rateswere significantly higher across all three conditions for letters addressedto \"person(s) in care of a group\" (i.e., Francis S. Bridges or Margaret A. Windsor in care of a group) rather than to the \"group(s)\" alone. Perhaps one reason for these findings isbecause our \"person-positivity\"conditions were varied enough on the \"personhood\" dimension toproduce a measurable \"positivity\" bonus in the form of more returnedletters for one condition than the other. Another reason might be that ourperson-positivity conditions both brought to mind a type of emotive ornon-ordinary person, of whom evaluators, e.g., letter finders, felt lesssimilar to. This may have resulted in evaluations, i.e., returned responses,being more positive for control conditions than the emotive one.'280 Bridges, Williamson, Thompson, & Windsor BATTERING 273 As expected, returned responses from the small towns were lower forthe emotive lesbian addressee; however, even the Advocates for Batteredand Abused Lesbian (AB AL) affiliation garnered a return rate of 43.9%.As such, our attitudinal data have, in fact, supported the basic premise ofMilgram et al.'s lost letter technique: namely that the probability of lostletters being returned depends on the social and political attributes of theaddressees' affiliations. The data suggest that further studies are neededfor comparisons of responses to lost letters in different community sizesettings, especially using new or untested social issues (e.g., Advocatesfor Battered and Abused Gay Men) known to elicit non-normaldistributions of public sentiment.Conclusions from these results should be viewed cautiously becauseof the following limitations. First, Francis Bridges, the addressee used inthe Florida and Alabama portion of the study, may have been perceivedby letter finders as a name for a man or a woman because of differentspellings (i.e., \"i\" for males and \"e\" for females). So it is possible that thehigher rate of return in Ohio may be have been due to a gender-specificeffect and less of a person-positive one since a lost letter may have beenmore likely to have been returned if it was addressed to a female (OH)than a male (FL/AL). Despite the potential for confounding the nameFrancis may have still been a better choice than the name Stephen whichis clearly the name of a male and the gender opposite of Margaret.Interestingly, only in Florida and Alabama and not Ohio was there asignificant association with returned responses for the individual andgroup names, with more letters returned with an individual name (146)than without (111) [X2 (N = 540) = 8.58, p<.003, effect size = .13].Further testing of gender-specific names as male and female addresseesin the same geographic location is warranted. Second, any effect on thedifferential return rates in Ohio and Florida and Alabama towns mayostensibly seem to be because of differences in the population, i.e., alower pedestrian density in public places in Florida and Alabama mayreduce the likelihood of a letter being found than in Ohio. Empirically,we have found that just because there were fewer public places in the 22small Florida and Alabama towns for people to go, doesn't mean thereare fewer people in those places (they are the only public places theyhave to go). Also, finding a lost letter and helping by carrying it awaymay be two different things. In an unpublished study, we found that thecorrelation between the immediate pedestrian density and the number ofnon-helpful passersby produced a moderately strong positive association.Thus, the greater the number of subjects passing by a lost letter, the lesslikely anyone one of them would respond to it. 274NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY REFERENCESAbrahamson, M., & Carter, V.

Filicide-suicide: In Search of MeaningPerry Tech UniversityKaylene BrownTexas Tech UniversityEach year a few parents murder their children and then commit suicide.A review of the literature suggests two primary motives for a parent tocommit such acts. The first motive involves actively attempting to harmthe child or children, which includes both accidental death as a result ofphysical abuse or actual murder as the primary intent. In this murdermotive, the parent may then commit suicide after feeling a deep sense ofdespair and hopelessness following an appraisal of their behavior towardstheir children. The second motive, or suicide motive, involves the parentpremeditating suicide and choosing to take the lives of their offspring aswell. In this \"mercy killing\" manner the intent is to relieve the current orfuture suffering or pain of their offspring. This article explores variousfactors in parental filicide-suicide and suggests what counselors shoulddo to prevent such tragedies.What do Mark Heath, Barbara Wyrzykowski and Ronald Jonker allhave in common? To most readers, these are just names. However, theseAustralians have recently come to the attention of the world in that theyall committed suicide and took their children with them. Heath gassedhimself and his four children, Wyrzykowski took her own life and thelives of her five children, and Jonker gassed himself and his threechildren on the northern outskirts of Perth. Australian newspapers placedthe pictures of these innocent children on the front pages.These occurrences have caused untold turmoil to the survivors of thefamilies and have left social workers, psychologists, and therapistspuzzled and concerned. While homicide-suicides have not received muchresearch attention, this is not a new phenomenon. Homicide-suicides dateat least as far back as the Ming dynasty (Rin, 1975) and even earlierAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Michael Shaughnessy,Psychology Dept, Eastern New Mexico University, Porta les, NM 88130.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 277-292.\u00a9 NAJP284 278NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY mentions can be found in Greek mythology. Sorenson and Peterson(1994) found that over the past several decades homicide was one of theleading causes of death in children in the United States. Furthermore,their research indicates that the rate of child homicide continues to be onthe rise. In Finland, 2% of all deaths of children under the age of 15 yearsresulted from homicide in 1995, and in 70%-80% of child homicides inrecent years, the perpetrator has been a family member (StatisticsFinland, 1996). While the intent of this article is not to explore childhomicide, it is important to note that oftentimes one or both parents ofthese children are the ones responsible for their homicide. Some of theseparents choose to take their own lives following the act of filicide. Thepurpose of this article is to explore the phenomenon of filicide-suicideand to consider ways in which counselors might help to address thisproblem. The topic of filicide-suicide within the broader context ofmurder-suicide will be discussed in terms of its prevalence worldwide,current research findings, the various methods of murder in murder-suicides, different motives for committing murder-suicide, and commonfactors of the murdering parent as well as the child victim. This articlewill conclude with a discussion of implications and considerations forcounselors.Murder-suicides occur worldwideIn an existential crisis, to take one's own life is, of course, a reflectionof the lack of meaning in one's own life. To take the lives of one's ownchildren is usually a senseless act. Certainly, these incidents do not takeplace in Australia alone; they can and do occur in other countries. A briefarticle in Maclean's on September 6th, 1999 read as follows:A 41-year-old Toronto man jumped to his death in front of a speeding subway train, dragging his three-year-old son with him. JeyabalanBalasingam, who immigrated to Canada from Sri Lanka in 1993, hadbeen treated for depression for several years, not uncommon for newimmigrants who leave family networks behind (p. 21).A more recent article in Maclean's on July 17, 2000 described asimilar event:One of the worst mass domestic killings in Canadian history occurred inKitchener, Ont. Four small children were murdered by their father, BillLuft, 42, who also stabbed his wife to death and shot himself fatally.Authorities said Luft had recently sought help for psychiatric problems(p. 23). 285 Collins, Shaughnessy, Bradley, & Brown FILICIDE279 While the two incidents described above occurred in Canada, filicide-suicides take place in the United States as well. The following Maclean' sexcerpt dated March 31, 1997 read:Huge debts led a self-made millionaire from Canada to kill his wife,eight-year-old son and then himself in West Palm Beach, Fla. FormerToronto developer Robert McIntosh, 72, shot his family with a .22-calibre handgun. A five-page suicide note said the parents did not want toburden anyone with raising their son and they felt he would be scarred bytheir deaths.It also said they attempted murder-suicide by carbonmonoxide poisoning in January, but the child talked them out of itmidway through (p. 41).Somander and Rammer (1991) studied infra- familial and extrafamilial child homicide in Sweden for the years 1971-1980. They citedresearch conducted by Grunfeld and Steen (1984) which indicated that\"attempted or successful suicide is a relatively common aftermath ofchild homicide.\" (p. 45). Somander and Rammer (1991) defined hom-icide-suicide as the killing of a child within the context of the suicide orsuicide attempt of the perpetrator.Iga (1996) wrote of the cultural aspects of Japanese oyako shinju(parent-child suicide) that occurred in the United States. Iga (1996) foundthat traditionally oyako shinju seemed to occur due to actual or expectedfinancial difficulty, which often occurred after divorce. According toBerman (1979), infanticide-suicide (which is a form of filicide-suicidethat involves victims under the age of one) appears markedly less often inthe United States than in cultures such as Japan. Haapasalo and Petaja(1999) studied mothers in Finland who killed or attempted to kill theirchildren and related it to the mothers' life circumstances and childhoodabuse. Furthermore, Buteau, Lesage, and Kiely (1993) investigatedhomicide followed by suicide in Quebec, Canada. While their studyconsidered all murder-suicides and not just those involving parents andtheir children, they do acknowledge that homicide-suicide \"often occursin a family context and may involve children as victims.\" (p. 552).Research on murder-suicidesMurder followed by suicide is relatively rare. In the United States, therate is about 2.2 per million population (Palmer & Humphrey, 1980), andmany of these are not parental filicide-suicide. Some may not involvefamily members at all while others may include a perpetrator who killstheir spouse or partner and then commits suicide. West (1967) found ahigher incidence of prior suicide attempts among those adults involved inmurder-suicides when compared to a matched suicide only group. In astudy of murder-suicides conducted in the United States, Berman (1979) 280NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY found that most of the perpetrators of murder-suicide used a firearm andshot their victim in the head before later killing themselves. Forty percentof the perpetrators in his study were under the influence of alcohol andfifty percent had prior arrests for criminal behavior. When comparing hisstudy with similar studies conducted by Selkin (1976) and Wolfgang(1968), he found that an overwhelming majority of cases involved onlyone other victim and used a violent method for carrying out the act.Most of the offenders in these three studies were male with a mean ageranging from 38 to 43 years old. The ethnicity of the offenders in thesestudies (which were conducted in the United States) tended to beCaucasian.West (1967) and Dorpat (1966) both argued that a majority ofperpetrators of murder-suicide are psychotic. While there is little follow-up research to substantiate these claims, Berman (1979) believes thatmany of these offenders had an unhealthy relationship with theindividuals who later became the victims of the murder-suicide act. Hefurther stated that these relationships were formed and sustained in amanner in which the two \"depended on and abused each other foraffection, displaying chronic love-hate patterns, omnipotent expectations,narcissistic demands, and definitions of love rigidly posed.\" (p. 21).Berman's study did not focus exclusively on filicide-suicide.However, some of the same factors may be relevant. Selkin (1971)reported that the fantasy of rescue, which involves freeing survivors fromthe pathology of the family system, may be a dominant motive in manymurder-suicides.Berman (1979) posited an intriguing motivation for why murder-suicide occurs. He argued that a dominant theme in murder-suicides isthat of dependent-protective. He concluded that, \"rather than with am-bivalence and rage, the homicide victim is viewed as dependent upon andneeding of the care-taking functions of the perpetrator.\" (p. 22). He alsoindicated that when this protective, supportive role is threatened throughloss of money, health, etc., feelings of hopelessness and frustration mightlead to this dependent-protective motivation for the murder-suicide. Even though in many cases of murder-suicide the primary motivation is murder, it does appear that suicide can also be a primary motivation.When this occurs, the homicide has been viewed as a \"merciful extensionof the fused ego state\" between the perpetrator and the victim (Cavan,1965, p. 22). According to Leonard (1967), the dominant theme whensuicide is the primary motive is the inadequacy of differentiation betweenself and object. In other words, according to neo-analytic thought,differentiation is the process by which an individual learns to chart his orher own direction in life. A parent may have some unresolved childhoodattachment issues with their mother and may seek to resolve such issues2 8 7 Collins, Shaughnessy, Bradley, & Brown FILICIDE281 by becoming so enmeshed with their own child that it creates a state offusion. Thus, the child becomes merely an extension of the parent's self.Regardless of the reasons proposed, the fact remains that theoccurrences of filicide-suicide should serve to alert mental healthprofessionals. Counselors should understand that there is somethingwrong with some individual value systems, and that people in the helpingprofessions have not always successfully assisted others in findingmeaning in their lives.Method of murder in filicideAccording to Haapasalo and Petaja (1999), mothers who killed orattempted to kill their child or children used a variety of methods, in-cluding drowning, drugging, strangulation, suffocation, neglect, physicalabuse, and stabbing.In their examination of 56 cases, they also foundother means of murder. These included the following: throwing theirchild in front of a moving vehicle, putting pet shampoo into an infant'sbottle for the purpose of poisoning the baby, striking a child with a bluntobject (a rock), and throwing a child into a wall. Haapasalo and Petaja(1999) even found two cases in which mothers used multiple methods oflethalitysimultaneously.In one instancea mother poisoned andsuffocated her child and in another case a mother stabbed and strangledher child. In younger children, drowning in a bathtub has been one of themost common methods (Haapasalo & Petaja, 1999). Cooper and Eaves(1996) investigated a case in which a mother killed her daughter andherself by carbon monoxide poisoning. Buteau, Lesage, and Kiely (1993)reported that firearms were used in 56% of the homicide-suicides thatthey investigated. According to an article in Maclean' s dated January 22,1996, James Huang, a 40-year-old Taiwanese real estate developer, killedfour members of his family and then committed suicide using two riflesand a shotgun.Handguns and other types of firearms have also beenreported as methods of murder-suicide (Morton, Runyan, Moracco, &Butts, 1998).From a review of the literature, it does appear that drowning such asin the bathtub seems to be a more common method of murder in youngerchildren although many other means have been used as mentioned above.Furthermore, like suicide, men seem to use more violent and lethal meansthan women when acting as perpetrator's in these murder-suicides. Theyoften use rifles, shotguns, handguns or other types of firearms as well asknives in carrying out these acts. While women have been known toshoot or stab their victim during a murder-suicide, they more often willresort to less violent measures like poisoning, drowning, and neglect. 282NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Motives for murder-suicidesFrom a review of the literature, there appears to be two primarymotives in a majority of these murder-suicides that involve one or bothparents and one or more children. We refer to these two motives as themurder motive and the suicide motive.Murder motive. In the first motive, the primary intent of the parent isto inflict harm on their child. In many cases of child abuse that result indeath, there are no premeditated thoughts of actually killing their son ordaughter but the child may \"accidentally\" die during the course of thephysical abuse. In other cases that involve the murder motive, the parentactually intended to commit murder. According to Resnick (1969), thiscan occur because of acute psychosis, acts related to an unwanted child,and spouse revenge. Scott (1973) found similar reasons for parentalfilicide. When exclusively considering mothers who kill their children,d'Orban (1979) found six different types which include the following:batteringmothers,mentallyillmothers,neo-naticides,retaliating mothers, women who killed unwanted children, and mercy killing.According to Haapasalo and Petaja (1999), revenge is a rare motive forchild killing. Crimmins, Langley, Brownstein, and Spunt (1997) referredto the \"Medea syndrome,\" after the Greektragedy of Medea, a jealous, vengeful wife who took her revenge on herhusband by murdering their two children.When the child dies either of accidental death secondary to physicalabuse or when murder is the primary intent, the parent who committedthe act may feel devastated and overcome with guilt. The parent thenmay subsequently make an attempt on their own life as a means of escapefrom the tremendous pressure created by their actions. There may beincidents reported where an infant dies of SIDS and the mother latercommits suicide following such a traumatic event. However, according toEmery (1993), maternal filicide may occasionally remain undetected.Emery (1993) found that up to 20% of all SIDS deaths might beattributed to something other than natural causes. Child death due to factitious disorder by proxy may be difficult to assess as well. Withfactitious disorder by proxy there is a deliberate production of feigning ofphysical or psychological signs or symptoms in another person who isunder the individual's care. Typically the victim is a young child and the perpetrator is the child's mother. The motivation for the mother'sbehavior seems to be a psychological need to assume the sick role byproxy. These mothers seem to find it very rewarding to nurture and takecare of their \"sick\" children. Unfortunately there may be times when amother with factitious disorder by proxy may do things to actually hurtthe child or make the child sick in an effort to take the role of caregiver.On these occasions there is always a risk of accidentally killing the child Collins, Shaughnessy, Bradley, & Brown FILICIDE283 in the process. Up to 85% of factitious disorder by proxy (also referred toas Munchhausen syndrome by proxy) involves the mother as theperpetrator (McClure, Davis, Meadow, & Sibert, 1996).When parents actually murder their children, they may do so for avariety of reasons. Some individuals who murder their children, then planon turning the gun on themselves, may at the last minute change theirminds, or be overcome with grief, remorse or be overwhelmed with whatthey have done and begin to re-evaluate and reassess their actions. Theymay then be immobilized with the reality of what they have done and feelthat they deserve punishment. There may also be outside intervention onthe part of police or neighbors.Parents may killtheirchildren due to paranoid delusions orhallucinations of auditory control. In this scenario the active phase ofschizophrenia, schizotypal personality disorder, delusional disorder, briefpsychotic disorder, or shared psychotic disorder may account for theiractions. Haapasalo and Petaja (1999) argue that a theoretical model of thepsychological processes underlying parental homicidal acts against achild is lacking in the literature. They posit that, from a psychologicalviewpoint, \"there appears to be no compelling reason to treat them[parental homicidal behaviors] as separate phenomena [from homicidesthat do not involve a parent].\" (p. 220).Suicide motive. In many cases of murder-suicide involving parentsand children, murder is not the primary motivation. In these instances,the primary motivation for the murder-suicide is the suicide of the parent.Some parents feel so depressed and hopeless that suicide becomesperceived as their only option. The parent may then worry about thewelfare of his or her children and may believe that taking the child's lifeas well will save the child from current or future suffering. Men continueto have higher rates of suicide than women (Stack, 2000) and this mayexplain why more fathers than mothers engage in filicide-suicide.In 41 of 42 nations surveyed (Kuwait being the exception), men hadhigher rates of suicide than women (Travis, 1990). Stack (2000)described many reasons for men having higher rates of suicide whichinclude the following: 1) males abuse alcohol more frequently, which canreduce their inhibitions (Canetto, 1992); 2) women are more religious,which reduces the likelihood that suicide will be considered as a viableoption in the facing of mounting stress (Stack, 1983); 3) women havestronger negative attitudes towards suicide attempts (Canetto, 1992); 4)women have more flexible coping skills which provide them with optionsto consider other than suicide (Girard, 1993); 5) women are more likelyto recognize and less likely to deny the warning signs of suicide, such asdepression, which may prompt them to seek professional help (Canetto,1992); 6) women are more likely to seek professional help, which can290 284NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY lower their risk of suicide (Canetto, 1992); 7) women have more extensive social support systems than men (Pescosolido & Wright,1990); 8) men may be more impulsive even when not under the influenceof drugs or alcohol (Stillion, 1984); 9) men have more access to lethalmeans of successfully committing suicide, such as firearms (Kushner,1985); and 10) failure in the primary adult male role (economic success)is more visible and obvious than failure in the primary adult female role(success in relationships) (Girard, 1993). This can lead to greater feelingsof desperation on the part of men compared to women.Resnick (1969) studied 88 cases of maternal filicide and classifiedthem according to their apparent motives. He found that in most cases thefilicide was altruistic. The mother either committed suicide and took herchild with her or the filicide was committed to relieve real or imaginedsuffering by the child. When suicide is the primary motivation for the murder-suicide, many of the same psychosocial factors that lead tosuicidal behavior in non-homicidal parents are also relevant in explainingthe suicidal behavior of parents who commit filicide-suicide (Cooper & Eaves, 1996; Fishbain, Rao, & Aldrich, 1985). For instance, a parent'spoor health may be a factor in their consideration of committing suicide.Another factor may be depression or other forms of mental illness.Cooper and Eaves (1996)studied two femalefilicide-suicide perpetrators. They described the first case as a \"psychotic break\" inwhich the female murdered her husband and two sons due to mental illness. In the second case, in which a woman killed herself and herdaughter by carbon monoxide poisoning, Cooper and Eaves (1996)mentioned that the woman had been consulting a psychiatrist for depression. This woman had left suicide notes that indicated extreme sensitivity to perceived slights from members of her family. Theperpetrator indicated that her motive was revenge against her mother andex-boyfriend. Thus, both of these cases seem to fit Daly and Wilson's(1988) \"insanity\" explanation of murder-suicide.Common variables that lead parents to murder-filicideFrom the literature examined, there is no model that definitivelyexplains both murder-suicide which did not involve family members andfilicide-suicide. However, several common variables were revealed in themurder-suiciding parent. These commonalties ranged from the influence of the parent's own childhood abuse (Haapasalo & Petaja, 1999) toaltruistic reasons citing the \"well-being of the child as a primary concern\"(Somander & Rammer, 1991, p. 49) to an intense love for the childrenwhich prompted a \"mercy killing\" (Iga, 1996). While men tend to kill their children more often than women, mothers are more frequentlyperpetrators than fathers during the child's first year of life which is Collins, Shaughnessy, Bradley, & Brown FILICIDE285 referred to as parental neo-naticide (Fornes, Druilhe, & Lecomte, 1995).This may result from the fact that mothers tend to spend significantlymore time with their infant children than fathers. Increased exposure mayexacerbate the stress experienced by the mother in caring for her infant.Mothers are also more likely to treat their children as extensions ofthemselves as compared to fathers, who are less likely to treat children asinseparable parts of themselves. This may increase the mother's risk formurdering her child and then taking her own life (Myers, 1970).Crittenden and Craig (1990) studied 171 cases of children under 13 yearskilled in one county from 1956 to 1986 and found that mothers wereperpetrators in 86% of neonatal deaths and in 39% of infant deaths.According to McKee and Shea (1998), a majority of mothers who killtheir children have been found to be single, young, and living in difficultcircumstances. These mothers appear to be immature in many respectsand their homicidal acts may be related to severe psychological stress intheir daily lives (Haapasalo & Petaja, 1999). This immaturity \"may bemanifested in their inability to meet socially and emotionally therequirements and responsibilities of adult life and the role of a mother.\"(p. 220).Another at-risk group, according to Haapasalo and Petaja (1999), areolder, married mothers who are experiencing marital difficulties. Homi-cidal behavior in these cases is usually precipitated by the child'sbehavior. The mother responds with aggression. For this at-risk group thechild often becomes a vicarious object of aggression felt toward ahusband or some other person (Silverman & Kennedy, 1988).With regard to ethnicity as a variable in filicide-suicide, the motivefor the filicide-suicide becomes a factor. If the primary motive is suicide,then the perpetrating parent is most likely to be a Caucasian. There isevidence in the literature that the suicide rate in the United States amongCaucasians is double the suicide rate of African Americans (Lester,1990).If, however, the primary motive in the filicide-suicide is murder,then African American parents may be at an increased risk of engaging infilicide-suicide.When confronted with frustration, African Americans are more apt toblame society or others and to externalize aggression in such forms ashomicide. In contrast, Caucasians are less likely to attribute their varioussocialand economicfailurestodiscrimination.As such, whenCaucasians are confronted with frustration, they are more apt thanAfrican Americans to attribute the frustration to their own inadequacies.Aggression, then, is more likely to be turned against oneself in suchforms as suicide (Stack, 2000, p. 147).As mentioned earlier, depression and other psychiatric disorders mayaccountfor some of the murder-suicide behavior. According to 286NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Haapasalo and Petaja (1999), \"exposure to acute stressors and traumaticevents with the subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms might accountfor some of the mental disorders observed in homicidal mothers.\" (p. 220). Murray and Carothers (1990) found postpartum depression issuesin approximately 10% of women, and this might account for some of thehomicidal behavior described above. Finally, a parent's own history ofchild abuse, or traumatization may play a role in filicide-suicide behavior(Haapasalo & Petaja, 1999).Crimmins et al. (1997) found that most women convicted of killing their child reported having experienced or witnessed physical and/orsexual abuse in childhood. And while not all abused parents continue thecycle of violence (Kaufman & Zig ler, 1993), many women who hadkilledtheirchild reported childhood experiences of \"severe andcontinuous verbal abuse, parental alcoholism, parental mental health problems, and the absence of the mother due to illness or death.\" (p.222). It should be noted, however, that these women who participated inthe study conducted by Crimmins et al. (1997) had not committed suicidefollowing the murder of their child. Therefore, it is uncertain as to whatextent these variables apply to mothers engaged in murder-suicide acts. Stress can play a significant role in murder-suicide behavior byparents. Fathers may be frustrated due to financial difficulties, fatigue,conflicts with family members, poor housing conditions, work-relatedstress, and child-related misbehaviors. Mothers may experience some of the frustrations that the fathers experience as well. However, mothersmay also struggle with issues such as the physiological changes andemotional lability of pregnancy, their partner's alcohol abuse, the stress involved in miscarriage, a lack of social relationships, their partner'sabsence from the home for extended periods, and the stress involved incarrying out various care-giving tasks (Haapasalo & Petaja, 1999).There is little in the current body of literature that suggests a causalrole for the media in filicide-suicide. However, there is evidence that, given the high rate of marital disruption in many countries, storiesconcerning suicides or murder-suicides of the divorced or people withmarital trouble might serve as a point of mass identification for copycatsuicides or murder-suicides. Stack (2000) found that stories about suicide victims with marital trouble were five times more closely linked tocopycat suicides than all other publicized stories.Finally, just as the influence of culturally important temporal factors and ceremonial occasions can affect suicide, these same factors may also play a role in filicide-suicide. According to Stack (1995), holidays,weekends, and springtime tend to be associated with rising expectations for fulfillment. \"If these expectations are not met, it seems plausible thatsuicidal behavior might increase.\" (p. 153). Gabennesch (1988) argues2b3 Collins, Shaughnessy, Bradley, & Brown FILICIDE287 that holidays may be filled with \"broken promises\" for some familymembers.Holidays raise expectations for individual fulfillment. When theseexpectations are not fulfilled by the holiday, suicide risk increases.Furthermore, frustrations involving such broken promises might alsoexplain any rise in suicidal behavior after a weekend (\"blue Monday\")and in the freshness of springtime (p. 129).Chew and McCleary (1995) found evidence that the degree ofseasonality in suicide in their study of 28 nations was related tomodernization. The greaterthe percentage of the labor force inagriculture, the greater the seasonality of suicide. This finding isconsistent with a classic Durkheimian perspective on seasonality insuicide in that it is a consequence of seasonality in social activity (e.g.,farming). While this evidence speaks more to suicidal behavior ratherthan filicide-suicide, seasonality may influence filicide-suicide behavior.Iffactorsofsuicideareassociatedwithfilicide-suicide,thensocioeconomic status and unemployment may play a role as well.Common features of the child victimStudies suggest a bi-modal distribution. In other words, children aremost often killed by their parents either during the first years of life or inadolescence (Fornes, Druilhe, & Lecomte, 1995; Marks & Kumar, 1996).Many of these children have had a history of prolonged child abuse andneglect (Crittenden & Craig, 1990). Many of them were unplanned orunwanted as well (Resnick, 1969). Although the child victims tend to bein good health (Haapasalo & Petaja, 1999), there are instances where thechild has medical problems or cognitive disabilities and a parent con-siders a \"mercy killing\" to protect their child from prolonged suffering orperceived future struggles.ConclusionThere no doubt have been talk show hosts discussing not onlyfilicide-suicide but also similarly unexplainable events involving murder-suicide such as those that occurred in Littleton, Colorado. There will bequestions such as \"Could this have been prevented?\" While at presentthere seem to be no definitive answers, these events may have beenprevented if appropriate identification and intervention had occurred.Identification and intervention must have as their foundation a clearunderstanding of the problem. There are still many unknowns in thestudy of filicide-suicide, and it is hoped that the present article willgenerate more interest and research on the topic. 288NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY What should counselors and therapists do?From the perspective of an existentialist counselor or therapist asignificant aspect of our work is to help restore meaning in the lives ofthose whom we serve. Many counselees struggle with existential crises intheir daily lives. Part of our role may not just be to polish our ability toidentify and intervene with people in these situations but also to make thepublic more aware of things that can be done to minimize such occur-rences. Does simply posting the pictures of child victims on the frontpage of the newspapers help in addressing this problem? It may serve thepurpose of awareness, but as the media move on to other significantevents in the world, the problem remains. In Frankl's book entitledMan's Search for Meaning, which was revised and updated in 1984, hecites a study conducted in France in which 89% of people polledadmitted that \"man needs something for which to live\" (p. 121-122). Byhaving something to live for, people may re-evaluate their thoughts ofharming themselves or others.Counselors and therapists (who work specifically towards helpingcounselees find a sense of meaning in love as well as pain and suffering)should help people to find significance in their existence and shouldassist them in finding meaning in their family (including their children).Frankl (1984) wrote that \"existential frustration can result in neurosis\" (p.123). As mentioned earlier, one of the factors that may play a role infilicide-suicide is mental illness.Helping others in reducing or coming to terms with their \"existentialfrustration\" may reduce their urges to resort to drastic measures such asmurder or suicide. Finding meaning in life can reduce this frustration. Inthe words of Nietzsche, \"He who has a why to live for can bear almostany how.\"Frankl (1984) alludes to a possible explanation for holidays andweekends being a time of higher incidence of suicide, and possiblyfilicide-suicide. He refers to \"Sunday neurosis\" as a \"kind of depressionwhich afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in theirlives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void withinthemselves becomes manifest.\" (p. 129). When others come to un- derstand themselves and find purpose in daily life, this existentialvacuum becomes less of a factor to them. A categorical imperative oflogotherapy which should be imparted to counselees is as follows: \"Liveas if you were living already for the second time and as if you had actedthe first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!\" (Frankl, 1984, p.131-132).Frankl believed that people can discover meaning in their lives: 1) bycreating work or doing things for others, 2) by experiencing something or encountering someone, and 3) by theattitudethey take toward235 Collins, Shaughnessy, Bradley, & Brown FILICIDE289 unavoidable suffering (p. 133). Counselors and therapists can apply theseprinciples by encouraging clients to look for ways to love and serveothers and to appreciate the beauty in their surroundings.Counselors must also help people find meaning in the parenting oftheir children. This can be done in a variety of ways, including startingparenting classes and forming parent support groups. Therapists mustcautiously take a longer, more critical, clinical look at the potential forviolence that their clients may possess. School personnel and schoolboard members must rethink their beliefs that \"it can't or won't happen here in our schools.\"While there have not been documented cases offilicide-suicide in school, mental health counselors should be preparedfor this eventuality. With the amount of stress in the field of teaching it isnot inconceivable that this event could occur.This invincibility fallacy which is commonly observed in theegocentrism of adolescents has no place in the school system. Astherapists, we recommend taking a proactive stance and working to helppeople find meaning in their lives. If other counselors and therapists are willing to do this the tragedy of filicide-suicide will occur less fre-quently. REFERENCESBerman, A. L. (1979). Dyadic Murder-suicide.

Like a spider web, it ties together one's beliefs about one's self, maladaptive behavior patterns, preoccupations, emotional issues, one's worldview -- in short, everyaspect of one's existence into an identity which depends upon smoking tomaintain its equilibrium. The task of freeing an individual from nicotinedependence is therefore a complex one.David and Carole Johnson's book \"Stop Smoking and ChewingTobacco for Life Changes\" tackles the problem from many angles. Itaddresses not only the task of achieving cessation from nicotine use butalso provides tools for preventing relapses. Its language is colorful, itstechniques imaginative. Yet, unlike other smoking-cessation books which I have read, this book's wide array of interventions are presented in awriting style so casual and a tone so warm and often comical that as one reads it, the book quickly becomes a warm, supportive friend to theindividual who struggles, with nerves frayed, to put out that last cigaretteor spit out that last chew. The collection of nicotine-cessation techniquespresented in the book is truly awesome and includes over 120 exercises incognitive-behavioralstrategies,affirmations, hypnosis, aversion, re- laxation techniques, and a host of other strategies targeted to assist the reader in becoming and staying nicotine-free. The homework exercises are not without pain. The aversion procedures, for example, are truly aversive even to read (as they should be). But then, if they were not, howcan they be called aversion procedures. The authors' own experience with nicotine cessation shows up in various comforting ways. For example, from time to time, thereare proverbs, wise old sayings, and just plaingood advice about how to \"hang in there\" when the going gets tough. The book includes a wealth of resources, e.g. Internet sites, nationalorganizations, readings and other useful materials to assist in thecessation and maintenance process. Techniques for relapse prevention are welcome part of this book. Iam all too well acquainted with a number ofprograms that have not addressed the issue of relapse adequately.

SelfJean BodonUniversity of Alabama at BirminghamThis study examined the relationship between religious activity andresponses to the Y2K crisis. A telephone survey of 497 Alabama residentsmeasured their frequency of church attendance and questioned them about(1) their knowledge of the term \"Y2K,\" (2) their perception of theseriousness of the problem, (3) how much information about Y2K that theynoticed in the media, (4) how many interpersonal discussions they had onthe topic, and (5) whether they made preparations in readiness for Y2K. Theresults indicated that religious activity was associated with perceptions ofthe amount of media coverage of Y2K, frequency of interpersonaldiscussion on the topic, and level of preparations for the possible crisis.Frequent church-goers were more likely to have taken preparations against aY2K problem, reported seeing more information about Y2K in the media,and engaged in more interpersonal discussions on the topic than did non-churchgoers. No significant difference was identified for either knowledgelevel or perception of the salience of the issues.A number of previous research studies have examined how informationabout critical events is perceived (Gantz, 1983; Greenberg, 1964; Kraus,Davis, 1973; Weaver-Lariscy, Sweeney &Steinfatt, 1984). More recently, researchers have looked at public responsesto the Y2K macro-crisis (Hickson, Powell, & Bodon, 2001), i.e., concernsover the possibility of computer disruptions after the end of the year 1999.The Y2K \"bug\" was perceived by some as a \"millennial panic\" that wasapocalyptic in nature (Lynch, 1999). Further, a definite date could be pin-pointed as the danger point- January 1, 2000a date which provided a\"time bomb\" for a number of apocalyptic predictions (Yourdon & Yourdon,1998).Some religious groups, though, saw the Y2K problem as a symptom of abroader, religious-based apocalyptic event, with some proclaiming that theAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Larry Powell, CommunicationStudies Department, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 901 South15th Street, Birmingham, AL 35294-2060.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, NO. 2, 295-302.NAJP 296NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Y2K bug would signal the end of the world (Larue, 1999). As one religiousadherent said, \"The fingerprints of God are on this coming storm\" (Farrar,1999, p. 14). The approaching date became a frequent topic for Sundaysermons (Feldstein, 1999), leading the American Banking Association toprovide a \"model\" Y2K sermon to churches that offered reassurance(\"Bankers turn to religion...., 1999).Such attitudes should not be surprising, given the important role thatreligion can have in attitude formation. Religious values are a particularlypotent basis of value expressive attitudes because religious beliefs are oftenrelated to both self-perception and group identification (with a church orreligious organization). Group identification is a known factor in framingperceptions. Penning (1988) and Katz (1960, p. 174) argued that ident-ification with a religious organization could influence an individual tointernalize the values of the organization. That concept was supported byWald (1987) who found that integration into religious groups influencedboth the political attitudes and political behavior of those groups' members.Religious values fall within Katz's (1960) value-expression function ofattitudes in which \"the individual derives satisfactions from expressingattitudes appropriate to his personal values and to his concept of himself\" (p.170). In essence, value-expressive attitudes reflect individuals' self-perception of who they are and their role within an external world. Theyallow the individual to give \"...positive expression to his central values andto the type of person he conceives himself to be\" (p. 173).Research has frequently supported the contention that religion caninfluence secular attitudes on such topics as divorce, abortion, schoolcurricula, feminism, and sexual liberation (Hammond, Shibley & Solow,1994). Jalen (1998) demonstrated that religious affiliations and beliefsaffect a wide variety of political attitudes and activities. Similarly, Leegeand Kellstedt (1993) found that religion influenced the political behavior oflarge groups of voters, and Lopatto (1985) argued that theology based onreligious affiliation served as a sieve through which voters filtered andevaluated their political world. That phenomenon was a major factor duringthe 1980s with the participation of the Moral Majority (Wald, 1987) andcontinued during the 1990s (Manza & Brooks, 1997) through groups likethe Christian Coalition.The Y2K crisis had the potential to trigger responses based on religiousvalues. The apocalyptic nature of the predicted problem was tailor-made forapocalyptic religions, while the machine-based source of the problem couldtrigger questions about human reliance on the \"god\" of technology. Suchpossibilities create a number of potential responses on the part of activechurch-goers that could (1) affect their knowledge of Y2K, (2) affect theirperception of the seriousness of the problem, (3) make them more sensitive Powell, Hickson, III, Self, & Bodon Religion & Y2K297 to information in the media about Y2K, (4) generate more interpersonaldiscussions about Y2K (Swanson, 1976), and (5) lead them to make morepreparations in readiness for Y2K. Thus five research hypotheses wereinvestigated.HI: Frequent church-goers will be more likely than non-church goers toknow the meaning of the term \"Y2K.\"H2:Frequent church-goers will perceive the Y2K crisis to be moreserious than non-church goers.H3: Frequent church-goers will report seeing more information aboutY2K in the media than will non-churchgoers.H4:Frequent church-goers will have more interpersonal discussionabout Y2K than will non-churchgoers.H5: Frequent church-goers will make more preparations for Y2K thanwill non-churchgoers.METHODParticipantsThe participants were 497 residents of Alabama (209 men, 288 women;median age, 49.2), who were interviewed in a stratified random sample inNovember of 1999 (margin of error, + 4. percent). The racial make-up ofthe sample (82.3% white, was operationalized with the following question: \"Somepeople have mentioned a potential problem when the year changes,something they call the `Y-2-K bug.' Off hand, would you happen to knowwhat \"Y-2-K\" stands for?\" If the participant identified Y-2-K as \"Year2000,\" they were given credit for a positive response to this question. Otherresponses were coded as incorrect.Perceived seriousness of the problem was measured by asking thefollowing question: \"Overall, would you say that the potential for computersto crash and cause major problems when the year 2000 arrives is (1) a veryserious problem, (2) something to be concerned about, but not a majorproblem, or (3) not much of a problem at all? (4) unsure.\" Those who chose\"unsure\" were excluded from the analysis.Perception of information in the media was measured with the followingquestion: \"How much have you heard about the Y-2-K problem in themedia, (1) a lot, (2) some, (3) not very much, or (4) not at all.\"Level of interpersonal discussions about Y2K was measured with thefollowing question: \"How much have you discussed the Y-2-K problem with 298NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY your friends and neighbors, (1) a lot, (2) some, (3) not very much, or (4) notat all?\"Preparation for the crisis was measured with the following question:\"The biggest concern for most people about the changing of the new year isthat computers may shut down, causing problems for banks, powercompanies and transportation. Have you or your family made any plans tohandle that in case it happens? (1) yes (2) no (3) unsure.\" Those who chose\"unsure\" were excluded from the analysis.Church attendance was measured by asking\" Do you usually attendchurch once a week or more, a few times a month, or a few times a year orless?\" Those who said they attended church once a week or more weredefined as \"frequent churchgoers.\" Those who said they attended \"a fewtimes a month\" were defined as \"occasional churchgoers.\" Those who saidthey attended church a few times a year or less were defined as \"non-churchgoers.\"ProcedureParticipants were selected using the following procedure. First, asampling formula was developed by dividing the state into six geographicalregions, and percentages were assigned to each area based upon voterparticipation in the 1996 presidential election. Second, 8,000 namesmatched with telephone numbers were randomly selected in clusters oftwenty names, and these were apportioned into the six geographical areas.Third, names were randomly selected from that list, contacted by telephone,and asked if they would participate in the survey. If they refused, a secondnumber was called (alternately the one immediately above or below theoriginal number selected). Participants were monitored to maintain genderbalance in each region. A total of 586 respondents were contacted by phone,of which 497 agreed to participate in the survey (response rate, 85%).Hypothesis 1 was tested with a 3 x 2 (church attendance by knowledge)chi-square analysis. Hypothesis 2 was tested with a 3 x 3 (church attendanceby seriousness rating) chi-square analysis. Hypothesis 3 was tested with a 3x 4 (church attendance by media information) chi-square analysis.Hypothesis 4 was tested with a 3 x 4 (church attendance by interpersonaldiscussion) chi-square analysis. Hypothesis 5 was tested with a 3 x 2 (churchattendance by preparations) chi-square analysis.RESULTSHypothesis 1 was not accepted. There was no significant relationship(X22 = 3.41) between knowing the meaning of Y2K and church attendance.Hypothesis 2 was not accepted. Perceived seriousness of the Y2K issuedid not vary (X24 = 8.51) by church attendance. Powell, Hickson, III, Self, & Bodon Religion & Y2K299 Hypothesis 3 was not accepted, but an unanticipated result wasidentified. Church attendance was associated with perceptions of the amountof information about Y2K in the media (X2 6 = 29.37, p < .001), but not inthe predicted manner. Occasional church-goers were more likely to reportthat the media had \"a lot\" of than didfrequent (62%) non-church-goers (67%).Hypothesis 4 was accepted. Frequency of interpersonal discussionsvaried by church attendance (X2 6 = 21.19, p < .001). Frequent church-goershad more interpersonal discussions about Y2K (50%) than did non-church-goers (35%).Hypothesis 5 was accepted. Those who had taken preparations against aY2K problem varied in terms of church attendance (X22 = 12.59, p < .001),with frequent church-goers making more preparations (30%) than non-church-goers (24%).DISCUSSIONFirst, it should be noted that one of our significant differences (a 6 %difference in hypothesis 5) is rather small and is partly due to large samplesize. The others are not especially large, so we recommend a cautiousinterpretation of the results.Religious activity was associated with perceptions of the amount ofmedia coverage of Y2K, frequency of interpersonal discussion on the topic,and level of preparations for the possible crisis. Frequent church-goers weremore likely to have taken preparations against a Y2K problem and engagedin more interpersonal discussions on the topic than did non-churchgoers,while occasional church-goers reported seeing more information about Y2Kin the media.No significant relationships were identified for either knowledge of theterm \"Y2K\" or perception of the salience of the issues. Thus, althoughchurch-goers saw more information in the media and were more likely tohave discussed the Y2K problem with others, they were no moreknowledgeable about it than were there non-church-going counterparts, nordid they see the problem as being more serious than non-church-goers.The lack of variation in the knowledge factor may be due to thesimplistic test used in this survey. All that was required to pass this test wasan awareness that Y2K was an abbreviation for \"Year 2000,\" and that levelof knowledge could have been achieved with a minimal level of exposure tothe information. Indeed, 60% of our participants knew the meaning of theterm \"Y2K.\" Thus, this finding may be an artifact of the measuringtechnique, since it does not provide a means of interpreting multiple levelsof knowledge. 300NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Of more interest is the finding that church-goers were more likely tohave taken preparations for Y2K, even though they did not see the problemas being any more serious than did non-church-goers. Two factors maycontribute to this result, one that is topic-specific in nature and one thatmight be a generalized trait for those who are active church-goers. First, ona topic-specific level, it may be a by-product of the perceived link betweenthe apocalyptic nature of the perceived crisis and the apocalyptic theology ofsome Christian religions. Such a perceived link could have increased themotivation for active church-goers to engage in behavior related to theirattitudes on this topic. Second, on a generalizable trait level, it may indicatethat church-goers are more likely to act on the basis of their attitudes thannon-church-goers. One theological element in many American religiousorganizations is the belief that religious values should be manifested inbehaviors (Weber, 1958). If an individual has such a religious mentality, thetendency to act on the basis of one's beliefs may extend to non-religiousattitudes.Regardless, the results indicate that religious activity is associated withbehavioral and perceptual elements related to the perceived Y2K crisis.Future studies should be conducted to extend knowledge on the relationshipbetween attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors of those who are active in thereligious community.

SterkBishop's UniversityOne-hundred-and-thirty-one undergraduate university students partici-pated in a study of the relationship between level and (in)stability of self-esteem and depression. Results of correlational and stepwise multiple re-gression analyses showed that depression was significantly related to lowas well as to unstable self-esteem. Furthermore, for individuals with highself-esteem, variation in self-esteem stability did not have a significantmoderating influence, whereas for those with low self-esteem, stable self-esteem appeared to be a protective factor.Within diverse theoretical orientations, self-esteem plays an importantrole in the etiology and maintenance of depression. Abraham (1911) andFreud (1917) suggested that anger turned inward upon the self generateslow self-esteem and depression. Fenichel (1945) described depressives asindividuals who try to compensate for their depleted self-worth byseeking comfort and reassurance from others. Bibring (1953) claimed thatdepression results when the ego feels helpless at achieving its goals andexperiences a loss of self-esteem. Beck (1967) suggested that negativeself-evaluations as part of a negative cognitive triad play an importantrole in depressive episodes. Seligman (1975) and Abrahamson, Metals lcy,and Alloy's (1989) respectively indicated that learned helplessness andhopelessness may result in a decline in self-esteem, and depression.Hence, there seems to be agreement that self-esteem is an importantcorrelate of depression, which is reflected in the fact that the DSM IV(American Psychiatric Association, 1994) lists negative self-esteem asone of the diagnostic criteria for depression.Many studies have shown a strong negative relationship between self-esteem and depression (e.g., Brockner & Guare, 1983; Mayol, 1985;Tennen Herzberger, 1987). However, most of these investigations haveAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: A. F. de Man, Department of .Psychology, Bishop's University, Lennoxville, Quebec, Canada J1M 1Z7 (e-mail:ademan@ubishops.ca).North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 303-308.NAJP309 304NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY not taken into consideration Rosenberg's (1986) suggestion that one maydistinguish between level of self-esteem (i.e., the amount of enduringglobal sense of worth and well-being a person has) and stability of self-esteem (i.e., the magnitude of short-term fluctuations in self-esteemlevel). Most have focused almost exclusively on level of self-esteem asthe element that is associated with depression, and have disregarded thepossible effect of variation in stability.Kernis, Grannemann and Mathis (1991) investigated the relationshipbetween level of self-esteem and depression in individuals with stable andunstable self-esteem. Consistent with previous research, they found aninverse relationship between overall level of self-esteem and depression.Further analysis showed that instability was related to higher levels ofdepression for individuals with high self-esteem and to lower levels ofdepression for those with low self-esteem. Roberts and Monroe (1992),on the other hand, found evidence for labile self-esteem as a vulnerabilityfactor for depressive symptoms, with unstable self-esteem predictingincreases in depressive symptoms in high as well as in low self-esteemindividuals.In light of the discrepancy between the findings of Kernis et al.(1991) and Roberts and Monroe (1992), the present study aimed toclarify the relationship between level of self-esteem, (in)stability of self-esteem, and depression.METHODParticipantsParticipants were an availability sample of 131 undergraduate univer-sity students (estimated age range: 18 24). This non-clinical group in-cluded 108 women and 23 men; five were non-Caucasian.Instruments and ProceduresSelf-esteem level and self-esteem (in)stability were assessed by Ro-senberg's (1965) a well-validated measureof global self-regard (Demo, 1985; Wylie, 1974), consists of 10 itemsrated on 4-point scales ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.Scores may vary from 10 (low self-esteem) to 40 (high self-esteem).Respondents completed the Self-Esteem Scale during regular classperiods on five different occasions (approximately equal intervals) over afive-week period. Each time, they were instructed to circle the responseoptions that best reflected how they felt at that particular moment. Levelof self-esteem of the individual participants was obtained by calculatingthe mean of the individual's total scores across the five assessments. Self-esteem (in)stability was computed as the standard deviation of the310 De Man, Gutierrez, & Sterk SELF-ESTEEM305 respondent's total scores across the repeated measurements (Kernis et al.,1991), with higher scores reflecting greater instability.Depression was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck,Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbauch, 1961) which has been shown to bea valid measure of depressive symptoms among college students (Bum-berry, Oliver, & McClure, 1978). The 21 items of this scale representdifferent manifestations of depressive states. Each item consists of 4 or 5statements reflecting various levels of the depressed feeling in question.Numerical values for each item may range from 0 (neutral) to 3 (maxi-mum intensity); total scores may range from 0 (low depression) to 63 (high depression). The depression scale was administered in the fifthweek following completion of the last self-esteem questionnaire.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONLevel of self-esteem scores varied from 20.20 to 40 (M = 30.87; SD =4.45), and (in)stability scores (i.e., standard deviations) ranged from 0 to 7.19 (M = 2.00; SD= 1.20). Depression scores varied from 0 to 30 (M =7.49; SD = 6.18).Skewed distributions were found for some of the variables. Transfor-mations were performed and bivariate correlations for the original as wellas the transformed data were calculated. The transformed data behavedno better than the original ones. Therefore, subsequent analyses werelimited to the original scores. Furthermore, correlation analyses showedno significant relations between gender and the variables under consid-eration. Accordingly, gender was omitted from subsequent analyses.Kernis et al. (1991) and Roberts and Monroe (1992) reported a sig-nificant negative relationship between level and (in)stability of self- esteem (with level of self-esteem respectively measured as self-esteemaverage or aggregated self-esteem), suggesting greater instability at thelow self-esteem level. In the present study, these two elements of self-esteem were not significantly related (r = -.12, p < .17), indicating thatvarying levels of self-esteem were randomly associated with varyinglevels of stability and instability.Correlation analyses further showed that low self-esteem (r = -.54, p < .0001) and unstable (r= .25, p < .003) self-esteem each were significantlyrelated to depression. Similar findings were reported by Kernis et al.(1991) and Roberts and Monroe (1992).A stepwise multiple regression analysis with depression as the de- pendent variable and level of self-esteem, self-esteem (in)stability, and the interaction between the latter two variables as predictors, identified level of self-esteem as best predictor, accounting for 29.4% (F 1,129 = 53.74, p < .0001) of the variance in depression. This percentage could be 306NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY significantly increased to 33.0% (F 2,128 = 31.55, p < .0001) and 35.4% p < .0001) respectively, by including self-esteem (in)-stability, and Level by (in)stability interaction in the predictive equation.Consistent with prior research, the significant main effect of level ofself-esteem indicated that respondents with low self-esteem generally re-ported greater depressive tendencies. The significant main effect of self-esteem (in)stability showed that participants with unstable self-esteemtended to report similar depressive inclinations. More important, theinteraction between self-esteem level and self-esteem (in)stability wassignificant. To interpret this interaction, mean depression scores werecalculated for four groups of participants created by taking the upper 30%and lower 30% of the respective scores for level and (in)stability of self-esteem (see Table 1). TABLE 1 Mean Scores and Standard Deviations for Depression inRelation to Level and Stability of Self-esteemStability of Self-esteemUnstableStableMSDMSD Low Self-esteem Level 15.886.699.336.00High Self-esteem Level 4.875.483.413.10 A survey of these mean scores showed that the group of respondentswith low, unstable self-esteem had the highest mean depression score,whereas the lowest mean depression score was found among participantswith stable, high self-esteem. A distribution such as this would not becongruent with the findings reported by Kernis et al. (1991), but wouldbe consistent with the observations made by Roberts and Monroe (1992).T-tests revealed a significant difference between the stable and unsta-ble low self-esteem groups (t = 2.86, p < .008), but not between the stableand unstable high self-esteem ones (t = .94, p < .35). Further differenceswere found between the stable low and high self-esteem groups (t = 3.57,p < .001), and between the unstable low and high self-esteem ones (t =4.99, p <.0001), with the difference between the two unstable groupsi312 De Man, Gutierrez, & Sterk SELF-ESTEEM307 being significantly greater than the difference between the two stableones.These findings present a virtual mirror image of the results reportedby Kernis et al. (1991). The latter found a substantial difference indepression between low and high self-esteem scorers, but only forindividuals with stable self-esteem, whereas the present study foundsignificant differences in depression between the two levels of self-esteem both for respondents with stable self-esteem and those withunstable self-esteem, but with a significantly larger difference amongindividuals with unstable self-esteem. Furthermore, Kernis et al. reporteda substantial difference in depression between respondents with stableand unstable high self-esteem, and a minimal difference betweenindividuals with stable and unstable low self-esteem, whereas in thepresent study a significant difference in depression was found betweenparticipants with stable and unstable low self-esteem, but not betweenrespondents with stable and unstable high self-esteem. Hence, thefindings of the present study are not congruent with those reported byKernis et al.The study by Roberts and Monroe (1992) demonstrated the viabilityof unstable self-esteem increasing depressive symptoms. The findings ofthe present study seem to agree with this. However, the cumulativeinteraction between level and (in)stability of self-esteem is only apparentat the low self-esteem level. For individuals with high self-esteem,variation in self-esteem stability does not appear to have a significantmoderating influence, whereas for those with low self-esteem, stabilitymay serve a protective function. Stated in other words, for individualswith low self-esteem, instability of self-esteem should be a good predictorof greater depression. REFERENCESAbraham, K. (1911).

Legal Attitudes Scale: A Factor Analytic StudyJames V. Couch and Donna L. SundreJames Madison UniversityA factor analysis of responses to the Legal Attitudes Scale identifiedthree independent factors. Preliminary construct and content validityresults are reported for these three factors. Results are discussed in terms of the continued development of a scale to measure attitudes inprospective jurors.The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the important contributionpsychology can provide in assessing jury beliefs. Singer (1995) providedjury selection guidance for practicing attorneys when he stated that ajuror's beliefs are \"the only consistent predictors of jury verdict\" (p. 18).Despite this sage advice, the literature is replete with conflicting adviceon how best to undertake the important task of jury selection.When a person is a criminal defendant or two parties are involved in a civil suit, a trial by an impartial jury is a right guaranteed by the U. S.Constitution. In exercising this right, counsel for both sides try to select a jury that meets the condition of impartiality. A variety of sources and diverse methods have been identified and accessed to aid counsel inundertaking this important task. Numerous trial advocacy texts giveguidance on jury selection (Jeans, 1993; Vinson, 1993). Trial folkloresuggests that individuals of certain occupations are more favorable to thedefense or prosecution. Fahringer (1993) counsels attorneys that attentionto a prospective juror's way of dress, facial expressions, body language,and the way the juror uses their eyes are important clues that will help theattorney \"achieve our objectives efficiently and effectively\" (p. 204).Presumably this means selecting a jury which is predisposed to the attorney's position. Fulero & Penrod (1990) provide an entertaining review of myths that have abounded within the legal community as todemographic variables that have been suggested as appropriate variables to use in selecting jurors. As these authors point out there are manyconflicting suggestions arising from these myths. Schutte (1996) comesto a similar conclusion, namely that the use of demographic variables in the selection of jurors is fraught with error.Psychologists can provide contributions based upon science to assistlegal counsel in fulfilling these critical duties. First, and foremost, the field of psychology has defined and developed methods by which stableAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Donna L. Sundre, Center forAssessment and Research James Virginia 22807; e-mail: sundredl@jmu.edu.North American Journal of Psychology: 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 309-320.NAJP3 1 r 310NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY personality traits can be assessed. Many of these assessment methodshave been scrutinized psychometrically and researched over time toprovide reliable and valid measures of personality constructs thought tobe associated with consistent juror beliefs and verdicts.Personality factors have been the focus of attention as counselorshave tried to select a jury that will be impartial but favorably predisposedto their side of the litigated issue. One of the personality factors whichhas been investigated is that of the authoritarian personality. Narby,Cutler, & Moran (1993) reported the results of a meta-analysis thatsuggests that authoritarianism is a reliable predictor of juror behavior.Boehm (1968) developed an instrument called the Legal AttitudesQuestionnaire (LAQ), which purports to measure authoritarian, anti-authoritarian, and equalitarian tendencies. The original LAQ consisted of30 items that were arranged in triads of one authoritarian, one anti-authoritarian, and one equalitarian item. Boehm defined the three LAQpersonality tendencies as follows:Authoritarian items expressed right wing philosophy, endorsed in-discriminately the acts of constituted authority, or were essentiallypunitiveinnature.Anti-authoritarianitemsexpressedleftwingsentiments, implied that the blame for all antisocial acts rested with thestructure of society, or indiscriminately rejected the acts of constitutedauthority. Equalitarian items endorsed traditional, liberal, nonextremepositions on legal questions or were couched in a form that indicated thequestions reasonably could have two answers (p. 740).To evaluate the LAQ in a mock jury format, Boehm (1968) presentedparticipants with one of two cases. One case was written such that the\"correct\" verdict was acquittal (Not Guilty scenario) while the secondcase called for a verdict of either manslaughter or second-degree murder(Guilty scenario). Participants were classified into age groups with\"younger\" participants being those less than 21 years old and \"older\"ones being those 21 years of age or older. Results indicated that both agegroup participants judged to be high on the authoritarianism dimensionwere more likely to convict a person described in the Not Guiltyscenario.Olderparticipantsjudgedtobehighontheanti-authoritarianism dimension were more likely to vote for acquittal of theperson described in the Guilty scenario. The results for younger anti-authoritarian participants given the Not Guilty scenario were in-conclusive. It should be noted that Boehm's classification of items on theLAQ was arbitrary and not governed by any statistical criterion such asfactor analysis.Other studies (Cowan, Thompson, & Ellsworth, 1984; Moran &Comfort, 1982) have demonstrated results similar to Boehm (1968), with Couch & SundreLEGAL ATTITUDES SCALE 311 participants scoring high on the authoritarian dimension being likely toreturn a verdict of guilty. In the Moran & Comfort study it should benoted that only 24 of the original 30 LAQ items were employed, andrequesting participants to rate levels of agreement with the items replacedthe forced-choice format. They also scored each item as legal author-itarian versus antiauthoritarian.Kravitz,Cutler, & Brock (1993)examined thepsychometricproperties of Boehm's LAQ. Kravitz, et al. believed that the forcedchoice nature of the items of the original LAQ led to a number ofpsychometric problems. To this end, they changed the forced choiceoption to a 6-point Likert-format response scale. In addition, Kravitz, etal. reduced the original 30-item scale to a 23-item scale (RLAQ23). Theyprovided some construct validity evidence through moderately high cor-relations with measures of death penalty attitudes and a revised versionof the F-scale authoritarianism scale. A low correlation with a socialdesirability scale was also reported. In two different studies, one withcollege students as participants and the second with jury-eligibleindividuals, Kravitz, et al. demonstrated the superiority of the RLAQ23as well as the usefulness of using the Likert-format response scale.Kravitz, et al. reported performing a \"confirmatory factor analysis ...(which) revealed that RLAQ23 was not unidimensional\" (p.672).Further they reported that \"... exploratory factor analyses varying inmethods of factor extraction and rotation failed to reveal factors that wereclearly interpretable and reliable\" (p. 672). Even though Kravitz, et al.reported performing these factor analytic investigations of the RLAQ23,they failed to report the results of such investigations and relied uponBoehm's original classification of items when developing scores for theauthoritarian, anti-authoritarian, and equalitarian scales.The present investigation seeks to extend the work of Kravitz, et al.by reporting a rotated factor structure for the RLAQ23. Factor scores forthe resulting factors can be obtained by averaging the subject's responseto each item comprising the factor (as was done in Kravitz, et al.), bytotaling responses to each item comprising the factor, or by using thefactor loadings to develop a weighted factor score. Further, by examiningthe factor structure of the RLAQ23 it is possible to determine whetherthis scale measures just the three dimensions as suggested by Boehm(1968) or whether the RLAQ23 items are measuring other aspects of thesubject's underlying belief system.METHODParticipantsA total of 225 students from the University subject pool volunteeredto participate in the study for course credit. Forty-four male and 181 312NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY female participants completed the survey instruments. The vast majorityof the students (88%) were eighteen or nineteen years of age. A variety of majors were represented, specificallyArts and Letters (24%), Education and Psychology (33%), Business (23%), ScienceandMathematics (11%), and Integrated Science and Technology (9%).TABLE 1 Demographic Questions and Response Options aQuestion Response OptionsHow would you classify yourpolitical orientation in termsof the two major politicalparties?How do you think ofyourself?Do you favor or oppose thedeath penalty for murder?Do you favor or oppose therequirement that parents haveto be notified before anabortion can Democratto5Strong Republican 1Extremely liberalto5Extremely conservative1Favor2 - Oppose1Favor2 Oppose a Several other demographic questions were asked but were not a part of thecurrent data analysis.MaterialsUpon arriving for the study, participants were read a set ofstandardized instructions.

Administration of theOccupational Survey was for another investigation and those results willnot be reported as part of the present investigation.The demographic sheet contained questions concerning the par-ticipant's age, gender, and college in which they were majoring. Inaddition, four questions were included to be used in construct validationof the RLAQ23 (see Table 1).The RLAQ23 consisted of the 23-item revision of Boehm's (1968)LAQ that was recommended for use by Kravitz, et al. (1993). Par-ticipants used a 6-point scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) toStrongly Agree (6). Fourteen of the RLAQ23 items were reversed scoredas directed by Kravitz, et al. prior to forming scores.318 Couch & SundreLEGAL ATTITUDES SCALE 313 TABLE 2 Factor Structure for the RLAQ23 a QuestionFactor 1Factor 2Factor 3LoadingLoadingLoading(Liber-(Authori(Police)tarian)-tarian)Unfair treatment of underprivileged groups and classes .61is the chief cause of crime.Too often, minority group members don't get fair trials. .60In the long run, liberty is more important than order. .59In determining a person's guilt or innocence, existence .52of a prior arrest record should not be considered.When there is a \"hung\" jury in a criminal case, the .47defendant should always be freed and the indictmentdismissed.No one should be convicted of a crime on the basis of .42circumstantial evidence, no matter how strong suchevidence.Wiretapping by anyone and for any reason should be .41completely illegal.Search warrants should clearly specify the person or .36things to be seized.A society with true freedom and equality for all would .36have very little crime.There is no need in a criminal case for the accused to .35prove his/her innocence beyond a reasonable doubt.It is moral and ethical for a lawyer to represent a .31defendant in a criminal case even when he/she believesthe client is guilty.Defendants in a criminal case should be required to .73take the witness stand.The accused should be made to take lie detector tests. .62Evidence illegally obtained should be admissible in .52court if such evidence is the only way of obtaining aconviction.The law coddles criminals to the detriment of society. .51Too many obviously guilty persons escape punishment .49because of legal technicalities.Citizens need to be protected against excess power as .63well as against criminals.Police should be allowed to arrest and question .60suspicious looking persons.The freedom of society is endangered as much by .52overzealous law enforcement as by the acts ofindividual criminals.Upstanding citizens have nothing to fear from police. .47a Three questions did not meet the .30 loading criterion.

Participantswho identified with the Republican Party were more likely to favor thedeath penalty for murder than participants who identified with theDemocratic Party, X2(2, n = 223) = 10.49, p < .005. Most participantstended to favor the notification of parents in the case of a minor seekingan abortion however fewer \"conservatives\" than would be expected bychance opposed such notification, x2(2, n = 224) = 9.02, p = .011. Insummary, these findings parallel those of Kravitz, et al. (1993), in whichparticipants reporting conservative political identification were morelikely to favor the death penalty. These relationships were used in theconstruct validation of the RLAQ23.Psychometric Characteristics of the RLAQ23Across the total set of 23 items the potential range for the total scalewas 23 to 138 with higher scores indicating greater authoritarian or rightwing views. The mean score was 85.63 with a standard deviation of10.31. The internal consistency coefficient, estimated using Cronbach'salpha, was .63. This is similar to the reliability reported by Kravitz, et al.320 Couch & SundreLEGAL ATTITUDES SCALE 315 (1993) intheir study using undergraduate college students. Itis interesting to note that when the scale was administered to a sample ofjury-eligible adults the reliability increased dramatically, even though thesample size consisted of only about 100 participants. We believe thisreliability increase is due to the increase in variability within the jury- eligible sample. The Kravitz, et al. (1993) paper did not report thedescriptive statistics for the total scale.The hypothesized unidimensional structure of the RLAQ23 was tested using Amos Version 3.51 (Arbuckle, 1995). This structuralequation modeling (SEM) confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) resultparalleled the result earlier obtained by Kravitz, et al. (1993). The uni-dimensional structure was not well supported by the current study sample data, x2 (230, n = 211)= 483.72, p < .001. In other words, thediscrepancy between the hypothesized structure and the observedcovariance matrix was quite large. However, the chi-square statistic hasbeen shown to be quite sensitive to sample size (Loehlin, 1992), such thatrelatively meager discrepancies lead to rejection with large samples andmajor discrepancies test non-significant with small samples. Two otherfit indices are presented below that also refute the unidimensional model. It should be noted that the Tucker-Lewis (1973) index has been shown through real and simulated data to be relatively independent of samplesize in confirmatory factor analysis studies (Marsh, Balla, & McDonald, 1988). Both the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) .370 and the Bentler's(1990) Comparative Fit Index (CFI). .427 provide strong evidence that the sample data do not support the hypothesized single factor structure.These indices follow a 0 to 1 scale with values greater than .9 consideredindicators of good fit. These indices further corroborate the earlier resultssuggesting lack of fit. At this stage of analysis, an exploratory factoranalysis (EFA) was conducted. While SEM is considered a priori, methods termed 'exploratory' are often employed totest a priorihypotheses. Alternative a priori models are often identified and tested. For the current study, the unidimensional model was specified, thentested in comparison to an alternative dimensional model. Alternativemodel generation can be specified but only when theory and statisticalcorrespondence provide appropriate guidance (Joreskog, 1993; Kline,1998).The inter-item correlation matrix was scrutinized to determine if itwas suitable for exploratory factor analysis. Bartlett's test of sphericityresulted in a significant chi-square ,x2 (253,n = 211) = 667.98 p < .001;thus, the hypothesis that the correlation matrix was an identity matrixwas rejected. However, when the matrix was subjected to the KMOmeasure of sampling adequacy, the results were not as heartening (KMO= .614). This value is considered mediocre for factor analysis (Kaiser,2 316NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY 1974). Review of the eigenvalues and the scree test suggested aparsimonious three-factor solution might be possible. Therefore, threefactors were extracted and orthogonally rotated using Varimax. The threefactors accounted for 28.9% of the total variation of the 23 variablessubmitted to principal components analysis. The tentative names andloadings on the three factors retained for study are presented in Table 2.All listed variables loaded principally on the factor for which they are reported; in other words, no variable listed in Table 2 had a factorloading with an absolute value above .30 on any other factor. The simplestructure of the factor solution was evident from the final rotation, sinceno variable loaded on more than one factor.The first factor extracted consisted of 11 statements primarily relatedto libertarian views.Six of the items had been classified originally asantiauthoritarian and five items as equalitarian. The internal consistencyof the items comprising the factor was alpha =.63. This is interesting,because despite the fact that 12 items were removed from the originalscale, the homogeneity of the items was not diminished. While thecontent of items contributing to this factor seem to emphasize libertarianattitudes, there is another characteristic of these items that bears mention;all of these items were stated in the same direction. In other words, all ofthe items that loaded on the first factor, regardless of their originalclassification by Boehm (1968) as antiauthoritarian or equalitarian were stated in a positive direction such that agreement was indicative oflibertarian attitudes and beliefs. Responses to these items were thenreverse coded following the Kravitz et al. (1993) scoring guidelines toform an indication of legal authoritarian beliefs. Thus, high scores on thelibertarian scale were reversed coded to indicate more legal authoritarianattitudes. The fact that none of the items loading on this scale requiredrespondents to indicate disagreement to conform to libertarian viewspresents a potential measurement flaw (Crocker & Algina, 1986; Dawes,1972; Haladyna, 1994).The second factor consisted of 5 items. Individuals scoring high onthis factor would endorse authoritarian views. The internal consistency ofthe factor was .57, which is fairly impressive given the small number ofitems contributing to it. All items loading on this factor originated fromthe original Boehm (1968) authoritarian scale. Parallel to the first factor items, all of these items were stated such that agreement with thestatement would be associated with authoritarian or right wing views.Thisresponseconsistencycharacteristicrepresentsthesamemeasurement threat described above.The third factor, which consisted of only 4 items, seemed to solicit respondents' perceptions of police. This factor had an internal con-sistency coefficient of .51, and was comprised of two items originally Couch & SundreLEGAL ATTITUDES SCALE 317 classified as authoritarian and two equalitarian items. Table 3 provides descriptive statistics for the scales derived from the factor solution. Correlation coefficients were computed between factor scores from the three factors and theresponses from the four demographic questionsshown in Table 1. Results indicated significant correlations between scores on Factor 1 and political orientation, in that subjects scoring higher on Factor 1(higher legal authoritarian)tended to be more Republican in orientation,r (218) = .21, p = .002, more conservative, r (217) = .23, p < .001, favor the death penalty, r (217)= -.18, p = .007, and favor parental notification in the case of abortion, r (218) = -.13, p = .049. For Factor 2, higherscores (more authoritarian) were associatedwith being identified with the Republican party, r (216) = .19, p= .005 and favoring the death penalty, r (215) = -.14, p = .04. There were no significant correlations involving Factor 3. Correlationsamong the demographic variables confirmed the chi-square analysis above in that subjects identifying with the Republican party were more conservative,r (221) = .51, p < .001, and favored the death penalty, r (221)= -.20, p = .003. Participants whowere more conservative in orientation favoredparental notification,r (222) = -.20, p = .002.TABLE ofMeanSDPotential RangeAlphaItemsLibertarian 1140.97.011-66.63Authoritarian 520.34.15-30.57Police411.33.24-24.51 The Kravitz, et al. (1993) scale modifications were quite successful in removing theipsative nature of the scale scores, eliminating the dependency associated with the original forced-choice triad item design, and reducing error and missing data incidence. However, results of the current study suggest, just as Kravitz, et al. (1993) recommended, that further revisionisnecessary to create a psychometrically soundinstrument. Several recommendations for future work appear warranted. Additional items need to be created for each of the assessed dimensions to enhance reliability. There is currently too much error variance associated with each scale. Some authors (Crocker & Algina, 1986; Dawes, 1972; Haladyna, 1994) provide guidelines for writing and 318NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY reviewing inventory items. Among the possible modifications that areconsistent with these guidelines are the following: 1) a better balance ofpositively and negatively expressed statements within each subscale andacross the instrument; 2) avoidance of statements containing universalssuch \"all,\" \"always,\" \"none,\" and \"merely,\" \"many,\" \"few,\" or \"seldom\"; of negatives such as \"not,\" \"none,\" \"never\"; and 5) avoidance of\"double-barreled\" items. These modifications enhancereliability and assist in control for response sets. Further, by increasingthe reliability of the scales, the potential for raising validity is enhanced.An additional methodological consideration is appropriate samplesfor scale improvement research. Pilot instrument research is best con-ducted with a group comparable to that for which the test is designed; in this case, the best sample would be jury eligible adults. The use ofhomogeneous samples, such as college students, restricts the variabilityof the scores, which, in turn, restricts reliability. The Kravitz, et al.(1993) reliability differences observed from their first (using under-graduates) to their second study (using jury-eligible adults) demonstratedthis point quite well. The current study supports the contention thatreliability using college student samples underestimates scale reliabilitiesfor the target population. The current study extends the work of Kravitz,et al. (1993) by again refuting the unidimensional structure of theRLAQ23, identifying three independent dimensional underlying re-sponses, and providing preliminary evidence of content and constructvalidity.

Life after College:Psychology Students'Perceptions of Salary,Business Hiring Criteria,and Graduate AdmissionCriteriaDeborah S. BriihlValdosta State UniversityNinetyundergraduatepsychologymajorsatamid-sizepublic southeastern regional university were asked to rate the importance of various characteristics for obtaining a job or getting into graduate school. They were also asked (1) what they perceived to be the minimum GPA and GRE scores for individuals getting into graduate programs; (2).the average GPA and GRE scores of individuals accepted into graduate programs; and (3) estimated starting salaries for individuals with a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in psychology. Findings revealed that students are aware ofmost of the top criteria used by businesses andgraduate schools and the minimum GPA and GRE scores; however, they were unaware of the relative importance of other criteria. Students tended to underestimate the average GPA and GRE scores of individuals accepted into graduateprograms and to overestimate starting salaries.One of the biggest questions that undergraduate students must face is what they will do after college. Should they seeka job or try to go to graduate school? Whatever path they choose, students needto be aware of the factorsnecessary for success in gaining either employment or entrance into graduate school. In this study, psychology undergraduate students were asked what they perceive to be the business hiring and graduate school admission criteria. These responseswere compared to the actual criteria used by both businesses and graduate schools.Previous research has summarized the average GPA and GREscores for psychology students inboth master's and doctorallevel programs (Norcross, & Spiegel, 1994; Landrum, Jeglum, & Cashin, 1994), and the usefulness ofa master's degree for gaining admission intoa doctoral program (Bonifazi, Crespy, & Rieker, 1997). The two most important objective criteria for gainingadmission to graduate school are GPA andGRE. In order to get intoa master's program, the average minimum GPA is 2.86 and GRE score of 984. The average scores of students accepted into a master's program are 3.27 GPA and 1033 GRE. Fora doctoral program, the average minimum GPA Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Deborah Briihl, Dept. of Psychology & Counseling, Valdosta State U., Valdosta, GA 31698.North American Journal ofPsychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 321-330.\u00a9 NAJP32\" 322NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY is 3.09 and GRE score of 1090. The average scores of students acceptedinto doctoral programs are 3.50 GPA and 1206 GRE (Norcross, et al.,1996). The nonobjective requirements for acceptance into doctoral ormaster's programs are the personal statement, letters of recommendation,and the interview. Doctoral programs are more likely to rate research ashighly important than are master's programs (Keith-Spiegel et al., 1994;Landrum, et al., 1994).Other studies have asked businesses what criteria are used for hiringdecisions (NACE, 1995a, 1997, 1999). The most important factors are (indescending order) communication skills, past experience, motivation,teamwork, GPA, interpersonal skills, technical and analytical skills.While GPA was rated of medium importance, 63% of businesses that useGPA as a prescreening qualifier used 3.0 as their cutoff score (NACE,1995b). GPA can also impact starting salary. According to the Oc-cupational Outlook Handbook (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2000-01), the starting salary of someone with a bachelor's in psychology washigher if the student had superior academic records. While the interviewis not among the items listed, employers have also discussed theimportance of first impressions as well as stressing communication skillsboth of which are conveyed in the interview (Allen, 1997; Perry &Goldberg, 1998).Are undergraduate psychology students aware of what is importantfor success in obtaining a job or getting into graduate school? Fewstudies have addressed this issue (e.g. Cashin & Landrum, 1991). In thepresent study I asked students their knowledge about the process.Students were asked what they thought the average starting salary wasfor someone with a bachelor's, master's, and doctorate in Psychology.They were also asked what they thought the minimum GPA and GREscores were for master's and doctoral programs and the average GPA andGRE of students that have been accepted into master's and doctoralprograms. Students then judged the importance of various criteria whenseeking a job (with a bachelor's degree) and when trying to get intograduate school.METHODParticipantsNinetyundergraduatepsychologymajorsfromaregionalsoutheastern university completed the questionnaire. The majority of theparticipants were women (79%) and seniors in college (64%). Whenstudents were asked to indicate their future plans, 75% stated theyplanned on going to graduate school at some time in the future. BriihlLIFE AFTER COLLEGE 323 Materials and ProcedureStudents were asked what they believed a person startingout with a bachelor's, a master's, anda doctorate in Psychology would earn. They were then asked what they thought the minimum GPA and GREscores were for someone to get into a master's and a doctoralprogram in psychology and what theaverage GPA and GRE score were for people who had gotten intoa master's and a doctoral program. Finally, they were given a list of factors and asked to judge the important of each. For businesses, students rated the importance of 14 factors that a business might use when theyare looking to hire someone with a bachelor's degree in psychology. For graduate school, students rated theimportance of 15 factors thata typical graduate program might use when it makes admissions decisions. Students were told to use the following key: 4=one of the main factors, 3=important, but not one of the maincriteria used, 2=minimally important, 1=not important.RESULTSTable 1 lists the studentresponses to the salary questions, and Table 2 lists the responses to the GPA and GRE questions. The dataare split between Senior and Sophomore/Junior responses. Since there were few sophomore responses (10% of all responses) and students donot declare their major untilthe middle of theirsophomore year, the data forTABLE 1Undergraduate psychology students' perceptions of average starting salaries foran individual with a Bachelor's, a Master's, and a parentheses.

Students tended to overestimate starting salaries, with seniors more realistic about starting salaries than 324NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY sophomores and juniors, although approximately 10% wrote \"don'tknow\" or left the question blank. Students were fairly accurate about theminimum GPA requirements needed to get into both a master's and a doctoral program. Sophomores and Juniors were more likelytooverestimate GRE scores as compared to Seniors. Both Seniors andJuniors/Sophomores underestimated the median GPA of students whohave been accepted for both the master's and the doctorate programs. These numbers do not include the relatively small percent (2 - 10%) of the students whose responses to the minimum and average GPAquestions were \"don't know\" or left the question blank.TABLE 2 Undergraduate psychology students' perceptions of theminimum GPA and GRE scores needed to get into Master'sprograms and Doctoral programs and the average score ofstudents in D/k stands for the percent of students who didnot respond to this question or wrote \"don't know.\" Included for comparison are the actualminimum and average scores of students in Master's and Doctoral programs (Norcross, et al., 1996).One of the more surprising findings was the question about GREscores. On average, 63% of the sophomores and juniors wrote \"don'tknow\" or left the question blank. Three juniors wrote down numbers that were impossible to obtain from the GRE test (2000, 34, 35). Moreseniors ventured a guess; however, between 17-30% of the responses were \"don't know\" or left blank. Only one senior wrote down animpossible GRE score (34). This finding was quite surprising considering BriihlLIFE AFTER COLLEGE 325 that 75% of the respondents stated that they were planning on going to Graduate school.Table 3 presents the criteria ranked according to their perceived importance.Studentsaccuratelyratedpast experience and com- munication skills as the top factors that employers look for when they are hiringsomeone.Studentsunderestimatedtheimportance of the interview, letters of reference, and GPA in getting a job. Students accurately indicated that important criteria for acceptance into graduate school were GPA and GREscores. However, they viewed an internshipto be more important than research experience, letters of reference, and the interview. Students also underestimated the importance of the personal statement. Most students knew that one does not need a master's degree before applying to most doctoral programs.

A number ofuseful findings emerged. First, students (particularly Sophomores andJuniors) were overly optimistic about the amount of a starting salary.While the average starting salary has increased over the past few years, aperson with a bachelor's degree in psychology still tends to have one ofthe lower starting salaries ($19,500-$22,300) as compared to business($2733,000), computer science/engineering ($32 - 41,000), healthsciences ($2549,000), or other sciences ($24 29,000) and Humanities($23 - 25,000) (Traub & Allen, 1996; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,2000-01). This trend also is true at both the master's and doctoral level.According to the APA (1999a, 1999b), the starting salary for someonewith a master's ranged from the mid $20's to mid $30's and for someonewith a doctorate, between the low $30's and mid $40's. Individuals withan M.B.A. can start at $42,000 and individuals with a doctorate in theother sciences (biology, chemistry, physics) can start at $45-60,000 (U.S.Bureauof LaborStatistics,2000-01).Thisdifferencebetweenpsychology and the other sciences also can be seen in the academicsetting. Faculty members teaching in those areas that have high-payingnonacademic jobs tend to be the ones making higher salaries.Seniors were fairly accurate about the objective criteria necessary toget into graduate school, both at the master's and doctoral levels,although both groups underestimated GPA scores. Students need to bemade aware of the fact that average GPA scores are higher than theminimum requirements and that merely having the minimum GPA doesnot guarantee acceptance into a graduate program, particularly given thehigh number of applicants to doctoral programs. An interesting findingwas the lack of knowledge about GRE scores. While Seniors were moreknowledgeable than Sophomores and Juniors about the necessary scores,a large percentage of the Seniors were still unable to guess. The resultsare even more surprising considering that the majority of the students inthis study stated that graduate school was part of their future plans.Students typically take the GRE at the beginning of their senior year.However, they should have started preparing for it a few months beforethey take the exam.As mentioned earlier, the main criteria to get into graduate school areGPA, GRE, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and theinterview (Bonifazi, et al., 1997; Keith-Spiegel, et et al.,1996). Students accurately indicated thatimportant criteria for acceptance into graduate school were GPA andGRE scores. However, they viewed an internship to be more importantthan research experience, letters of reference, and the personal statement.332 BriihlLtht, AFTER COLLEGE 327 Students also underestimated the importance of the interview. It shouldbe noted, however, that the graduate program at the university where thestudy took place does not use the interview as part of the applicationprocess.The main criteria for obtaining a job are communication skills, pastexperience, motivation, teamwork, GPA, interpersonal skills, technicaland analytical skills (NACE, 1995a, 1997, 1999). Students accuratelyrated past experience and communication skills as the top factors thatemployers look for when they are hiring someone. Students un-derestimated the importance of the interview, letters of reference, andGPA ingettinga job. Students overestimated the importance ofinformation gathering skills and underestimated the importance of socialskills.These results suggest that, while students know what primary factorsare necessary to obtain a job or get into graduate school, they are not asfamiliar with second-order criteria that are commonly used. According toKeith-Spiegel, et al. (1994), doctoral programs receive a large number ofapplicants and first order criteria are not enough to narrow the field to thenumber of slots available. Subsequently, they must rely heavily on thesesecond-order criteria to make final acceptance decisions. It is importantfor students to realize that they need to focus their time and resources notjust on grades, but also on other areas, particularly research, if they wishto get into a graduate program. Students need to be aware that theminimum requirements needed to get into a graduate program do notguarantee acceptance. Students knew the minimum requirements, butthey underestimated the average GPA and GRE scores of students inmaster's and doctoral programs.The same holds true for obtaining a job. Many students were notaware of the fact that both graduate programs and future employers lookat GPA when they consider applicants. In addition, students also need topromote the skills that they obtain with an undergraduate degree inpsychology. Many of the skills that employers are seeking are those thatstudents obtain in a bachelor's program such as communication, timemanagement, social, and information processing skills. According to theAPA Research Office (1999c), between 1996 and 1997 over 70,000bachelor's degrees were awarded in psychology. During that same timeperiod, between 10,000 and 20,000 students obtained master's degrees inpsychology and less than 10,000 obtained a Ph.D. It is obvious that themajority of students who get a bachelor's degree in psychology do not goto graduate school. As advisors, it is important for us to not only makesure thatstudents know the criteriafor acceptance into graduateprograms, but also the criteria necessary to obtain a job. 328NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY How can we decrease the amount of misinformation that our studentsseem to have? Asinstructors, we can offer career education courses,include career projects in our courses that require students to obtain thisinformation, or create handouts or web sites with this information. Manyinstitutions have career centers on campus. As advisors, we canencourage our students tovisit the center or invite individuals from thecareer center to our classes or to psychology club meetings. In addition,we, as advisors, need tobecome more knowledgeable about theserequirements. Many institutions have little formal advisor trainingbeyond a basic understanding of the coursework that students need tocomplete. Perhaps more institutions need to develop a better way oftraining advisors, either at the institution level or in graduate programs.These interventions would provide more accurate informationtostudents, enabling them to make better, informed decisions about theircollege and future career plans.

Occupational Outlook HandbookWashington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office. The Effect of Politenessand Grammar onUser Perceptions of Electronic MailSherri L. JessmerNorth Rose, New YorkDavid AndersonAllegheny CollegeThe present study examined the effect of the nature (polite vs. impolite) and the format (grammaticalvs. ungrammatical) of an e-mail message onhow the sender of thatmessage was perceived by the recipient. Nineattributes of the sender were examined: status, gender, competency, status in relation to the recipient, how much the recipient would like to work on a regular basis with the sender, friendliness, how likable the sender was, if the message had been edited, and if the recipient thought that the sender cared how the recipient was going to react to the message. In a sample of 112 undergraduates, senders of polite grammaticalmessages were viewed the most positively; impolite messages were seenas being authored by high status males; and polite messages were seen as originating with competent females. No significant differences were found between the two data collection methods that were used: e-mail vs. paper presentation of the questionnaire.Electronic mail (e-mail) is just the most recent in a long line of alternatives to face-to-face communication. The personal, hand-written letters of the nineteenth century were replaced by the telephone call ofthe twentieth-century; and e-mail is replacing them both in the twenty- first century (NUA Internet Surveys, 1998). But even if it is not true that \"the medium is the message,\" we do know that the e-mail medium isdifferent in many ways from these other means of communication(Adkins & Brashers, 1995; Lea & Spears, 1992). The present researchexamined how the nature and format of an e-mail message might affecthow a recipient perceives the sender of that message.CarnevaleandProbst(1997)pointedoutthattextbased communication makes interaction more difficult because it is less \"rich\" than other forms of communication. For example, a number of re- searchers have noted the lack of social and status cues in e-mail (Carnevale & Probst, 1997; Garton & Wellman, 1995; McCormick &Author Correspondence should be sent to: David Dept. ofPsychology, Allegheny College, Meadville, PA 16335. E-mail: danders@allegheny.eduNorth American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 331-346.NAJP3 f.iESTAVAILABLE 332NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY McCormick, 1992) while Sproull and Kies ler (1986) suggested thatalthough people make use of both static (e.g., appearance) and dynamic(e.g., nodding) cues as they communicate, dynamic cues are completelymissing from e-mail. Static cues, on the other hand, are present, althoughthey may appear in a different way than in face-to-face communication.In an extensive review of the literature on language and persuasion,Burgoon and Miller (1985) noted that language is a rule-governed systemand that we all develop expectations and norms concerning usage inparticular circumstances. (Also see Adkins & Brashers, 1995 andHolmes, 1995.) But what happens when those expectations and normsare violated? For example, how do we react when the language in an e-mail message is ungrammatical or impolite?Experiments in impression formation suggest that we often make useof social schemas to make judgements about the characteristics of a role,an event, a person, or a group (Fisk & Taylor, 1991). Some of the mostpervasive social schemas concern gender differences, i.e., expectationsabout what is appropriate behavior for males and females. Eagly (1987)has suggested social norms provide a way to understand the source ofthese expectations. According to Eagly, social norms are shared expec-tations about appropriate behavior. A major assumption of the social-roleinterpretation of sex differences is that the perception of women asespecially communal and men as especially agentic stems from thediffering specific roles that women and men occupy in society. Shefurther notes these pervasive differences in gender roles lead todifferences in social status and power.Recently, an interesting analysis of men's and women's speech andits relationship to status and power was published (Holmes, 1995).Holmes not only found differences in politeness patterns between menand women, but she noted that the more polite tone of women's speech isoften associated with submissive social roles.Since context cues often act as reminders of social norms, theirabsence can lead to reduced attention to the behavioral norms that usuallygovern interpersonal behavior. For example, Lea and Spears (1991) notedthat as an interaction becomes depersonalized, communication alsobecomes less personal. They suggest that as we become less aware ofour audience, we become secure in our anonymity and hence less boundby social norms. Several researchers (Carnevale & Probst, 1997; Garton& Wellman, 1995; Weisband & Reining, 1995) suggest that employeeswho communicate with their supervisors by means of e-mail could beginto lose the sense of the social status of their supervisor. This in turn couldlead to miscommunication that could, in extreme cases, lead to hostilityand flaming (Welch, 1997). Chapman (1995) added that when people are Jessmer & AndersonPOLITENESS & GRAMMAR 333 completely physically removed from each other they feel safe in verballyassaulting the recipient of their messages.Contextual cues also serve to help us make assumptions about the sender of a message, including gender, age, and race. However, asSproull & Kies ler (1986) pointed out, when there are few such cues,senders and receivers may assume that they possess the same qualitiessince they are unable to determine the race or gender of the other.When status cues are reduced in e-mail messages, the recipient must decide the status of the sender based on other information. Assumptionsabout the status of the individual sending a message can influence howthe recipient interprets the message. As Lee (1996) noted, there is a large body of social science research that indicates that statusis a keycomponent to how persuasive a person is perceived to be. High status individuals are usually considered more competent and more know-ledgeable than low status people (Lee, 1996).Stahelski and Paynton (1995) maintained that people of high statusare perceived as using what they called a \"strong strategy\" composed ofhigh authority, sanctions, reasoning, and a display of power. On theother hand, people of lower status are perceived as using a weak strategycomposed of friendliness, assertiveness, coalition, influence tactics, and less control of resources. But how can one determine status in electroniccommunication when so few cues are available?Sherwood (1998), the creator of a website on how to write effectivee-mail, suggested that one of the biggest cues people use to determine status is by the way the writer of the message uses language. Theaccurate use of large words, but not in over abundance, can imply highstatus, for example. Poor grammar and misspellings can imply that thesender is uneducated and hence of low status.In the same vein, Glassberg, Kettinger, and Logan (1996) pointed out that e-mail messages tend to de-emphasize professional titles, such as \"Dr.\" or \"President of.\" User names usually do not include clues to professional status. This is in contrast to status cues provided by aletterhead or by dress in face-to-face meetings.The role of language in determining gender has been extensivelyexamined. Unfortunately, most of the research has focused on verbal orwritten communication, with little work on e-mail. The work that hasbeen done, suggests that men use talking for attention purposes, as a wayof getting and keeping attention, while women use talk for relationshippurposes and to maintain connections (Rodino, 1997). Women tend tomake more use of qualifiers, exaggerations, extreme politeness, and tagquestions while put-downs, strong assertions, and sarcasm characterize male language. These conclusions were based on the analysis ofconversations from an Internet Relay Chat channel (Rodino, 1997).33 334NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY In one of the few attempts to verify these assertions in electroniccommunication, Witmer and Katzman (1997) examined messages postedto public newsgroups. They found that females used graphical accentsmore than men did, thus suggesting more emotional tone in theirmessages.The final question in this study concerns the use of e-mail itself togather data. As more and more research is being done electronically, itbecomes more important to determine what, if any, differences there arebased on the mode of presentation of a questionnaire. To date theresearch seems to suggest that electronic responses tend to be moreextreme, more self-disclosing, provide less socially desirable answers(Kies ler & Sproull, 1986; Sproull, 1986), and are more self-absorbed(Kies ler & Sproull, 1986).As contextual cues are reduced in a communication environment suchas e-mail, the recipient of a message must make assumptions about thesender of the message based on the information that is available withinthe message itself. The literature suggests that assumptions about gender(Allen, 1995; Sproull & Kies ler, 1986) Sherwood, 1998; Stahelslci & Paynton, 1995) are often deter-mining factors in how people respond to e-mail. In an attempt to teaseout some of the specific components of e-mail that might effect theseassumptions, the present study examined the influence of the nature of arequest (polite or impolite) and format of a request (grammatical orungrammatical) on a user's perception of the status, gender, andcompetency of the sender. In addition, the researchers explored twomethods of data collection, paper-and-pencil versus e-mail presentations.Based on the literature, four hypotheses were proposed for ex-amination.Hl: It was hypothesized that grammatical messages would beperceived to have been written by a person of higher status thanungrammatical messages.H2: Since grammatical messages would be seen as originating withhigher status individuals, it was assumed that people of higher statuswould also be seen as more competent.H3: It was proposed that polite message authors would more often beperceived as being female.H4: Finally, concerning socially desirable responses, it was proposedthat in the results obtained via e-mail we would see an exaggeration ofthe findings noted above. For example, if the perception of gender issignificantly affected by the nature of the message, then this result wouldbe larger in the group who responded to the questionnaire via e-mailcompared to those who completed a paper version.339 Jessmer & AndersonPOLITENESS & GRAMMAR 335 METHODParticipantsOne hundred twelve undergraduates (80 females and 32 males, ages18-21, 95%+ white) volunteered to participate in the study. Fifty-seven (42 females and 15 males) completed the paper version of the questionnaire and 55 (38 females and 17 males) the e-mail version. Students indicated their preference for paper or e-mail versions of the questionnaire on a sign-up sheet that was distributed to all sections ofintroductory psychology (none taught by the authors). All students receivedextracreditinanintroductorypsychologyclassfor participation.MaterialsFour messages that varied in the nature of the request (polite orimpolite) and the format of the request (grammatical or ungrammatical) were created. This produced messages that were polite and grammatical;impolite and grammatical; polite and ungrammatical; and impolite andungrammatical. Messages were one paragraph in length and addressed the need to limit theuse of copiers and printers to business relatedactivities.The polite, grammatical message read as follows: \"This is just a note to request that the main copiers and printers not be used for personalcopies. Please make personal copies using only the copier in the breakroom. Unfortunately, there is a small charge for copies on this machine but in order to reduce costs within the office we need to try to maintain this policy. We are sorry tocause any inconvenience by the enforcementof these policies. I hope that this is the last time this issue will need to be addressed.\"The impolite messages threatened \"strict repercussions\" and noted that \"THIS IS THE LAST TIME THIS ISSUE WILL BE BROUGHT UP.\" Ungrammaticalmessages included misspellings, typing errors(\"PLEase\"), missing punctuation, and fractured grammar (e.g., \"FEE 10 cents per copy\" and \"iT will not be addressed again\").Design and ProcedureTo maximize the number ofresponses to each message, a within-subjects design was used. That is, all participants were asked to read and respond to all four of themessages. Participants were asked to imaginethat they had received each of the four e-mail messages froman anonymous sender at their place of work. They were instructed to carefully read eachone and then respond to 12 seven-point Likert scaleitems.340 336NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Approximately one-half of the participants completed a paper-and-pencil version of the questionnaire during several group out-of-classtesting sessions. The other half received the same questionnaire via e-mail and returned it electronically to the experimenters. The result was a2 x 2 x 2 design: first two factors within-subjects, third factor between -subjects.In addition to three items designed as manipulation checks, nineseven-point Likert scales asked the reader to judge several qualities of themessage. These included: power/status of the sender, power/status of thesender in relation to the recipient, gender of the sender, competency ofthe sender, friendliness of the sender, likeability of the sender, the editingof the message, overall reaction to the message, and the extent to whichthe recipient would want to work with the sender on a regular basis.Upon completion of the paper questionnaires, participants wereprovided with a debriefing statement outlining the purpose of the study.E-mail participants were provided with the same statement by return e-mail. Before the data were analyzed all identifying information wasremoved from the e-mail questionnaires.RESULTSManipulation ChecksManipulation checks were examined to ensure that the levels of theindependent variable were perceived as they were intended. Participantswere asked about the grammatical structure of each message, thepoliteness of the message, and the format of the message. Messages werecompared across the entire sample (grammatical versus ungrammatical;polite versus impolite; and well formatted versus poorly formatted) aswell as within each presentation method (e.g., paper presentation:grammatical versus ungrammatical).Grammatical messages (M = 5.24, SD = 1.55) were reported to bemore grammatical than ungrammatical messages (M = 1.68, SD = 1.20), t446 = 27.10, p < .01. In addition, the polite messages (M = 5.00, SD =1.74) were viewed as more polite than impolite messages (M = 2.53, SD= 1.31), t 446 = 16.89, p < .01.These manipulations were effective in both manners of presentation.In the e-mail responses, grammatical messages (M = 5.12, SD = 1.77)were seen as more grammatical than ungrammatical messages (M = 1.96,t 218 =SD = 1.46),14.41, p < .01. Also, the e-mail polite messages (M =5.11, SD = 1.88) were perceived as more polite than the impolitemessages (M = 2.56, SD = t 218 = 11.27, p < .01.In the paper responses, the polite messages (M = 4.89, SD = 1.60)were agreed to be more polite than the impolite messages (M = 2.50, SD= 1.17), t 226 = 12.80, p < .01. In addition, the grammatical messages in Jessmer & AndersonPOLITENESS & GRAMMAR 337 the paper presentation (M = 5.35, SD = 1.28) were seen as moregrammatical than the ungrammatical messages (M = 1.42, SD = 0.82), t226 =27.57, p < .01.

Perceived Attributes of the SenderThe three perceived attributes of the sender, status (power in thecompany) gender, and competency, were examined independently using2 x 2 x 2 one-between (e-mail/paper participation), two-within analysisof variance (polite/impolite and grammatical/ungrammatical).StatusNo significant effects were found in the status of the sender of themessages as a function of the method of questionnaire administration (F1,110 =1.14, MSE = 3.27). On the other hand, impolite messages wereseen as being written by a person in a position of power (F 1,110 = 20.66,p < .01, MSE =0.99) while grammatical messages were seen asoriginating with individuals with more power (F 1,110 =157.05, p < .01,MSE = 2.49). The means used in these comparisons can be found inTable 1. No significant interactions were found between the politeness,grammar, and method of questionnaire administration.GenderThere were no significant differences found on the perceived genderof the sender as a function of the manner of presentation (F 1,110 =1.97,MSE = 3.33). However, impolite messages were seen as being written by 338NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY a male (F 1,110 = 42.05, p < .05, MSE = 1.22) as were ungrammaticalmessages (F = 15.62, p < .05, MSE = 1.30). See Table 1 for details.The only significant interaction concerning gender was found between the nature of the request and the format of the request (F 1,110 = 29.85, p < .05, MSE= 0.88). Ungrammatical messages were seen as being authored by males whether they were polite (M = 4.28, SD = 1.32) or impolite (M = 4.47, SD = 1.70). However, grammatical messages were viewed as coming from males only if they were impolite (M= 4.53, SD = 1.48). That is, only with polite grammatical messages did the participants view the e-mail as coming from a female (M = 3.37, SD = 1.16).

N = 224 for all message types. Competency of SenderNo significant differenceswere found on competency of the sender as a function of the manner of participation (F Lim= 0.61, p > .05).Higher competency ratingswere given when the e-mail was polite (F1,110 = 8.46, p < .05, MSE = 1.49) and grammatical (F 1,110 = 509.92, p < .05, MSE = 1.88). See Table 1 for means. None of the interactions involving the competency of the sender were significant. Jessmer & AndersonPOLITENESS & GRAMMAR 339 Analysis of Additional AttributesIn addition to the main attributes noted above, several other attributesof the sender as perceived by the recipient were examined. A series of 2x 2 x 2 one-between (e-mail/paper participation), two-within and grammatical/ungrammatical) were done onthese six attributes.No main effects or interactions involving the method of presentationwere significant for any of the six attributes. However, the same patternemerged with the main effects and interactions of all six when messagetype and format were examined. 1) Grammatical messages were seenmore positively; 2) Polite messages were rated more positively; and 3)polite/grammatical messages were perceived more positively (with oneexception) than the other combinations. See Table 2 and Table 3 for themeans and standard deviations and Table 4 for statistical results.

Participants were more likely to agree that the sender was morepowerful (Relative status: \"The sender of this message has more powerthan the recipient\") when the message was polite or when the messagewas grammatical. And although polite/grammatical messages were seen originatingfromamorepowerfulsenderwhen comparedto 340NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY polite/ungrammatical and impolite/ungrammatical e-mail,themost powerful senders were seen in messages that were grammatical but impolite. This complex interaction is the exception to the general findings noted above.The attribute of \"work basis\" addressed the extent to which the recipient of the message thought that they would like to work with the sender on a regular basis. And as might be expected, recipients were more likely to want to work with the senders of polite messages and with the senders of grammaticalmessages. And finally, the interaction patternnoted above wasseen with work basis. That is, messages that were both polite and grammatical elicited much more positive ratings that those ofany other combination. See Tables 2 and 3 for means and standard deviations.TABLE 4 Analysis of Variance F values (and Mean Squared Errors) forAdditional Attributes of the Sender of an E-mail Message for the Main Effects and Interaction. AttributeMessage TypePolite/ImpoliteGrammatical/Ungrammatical P/I x 3.93,< .05 and Fa, = 6.88, p < .01 Polite messages were viewedas having been written by a more friendly person as were grammatical messages. The authors of messages that were both polite andgrammatical were perceivedas being significantly more friendly than other messages types. (See Tables 2, 3, and 4.)The same patternwas seen in the question about the likeability of thesender. The authors of the polite messages were seen as more likable, as were the authors of the grammatical e-mail. Furthermore, the authors of polite/grammatical messages were perceived as significantly more likable than the other combinations. Jessmer & AndersonPOLITENESS & GRAMMAR 341 Editing refers to the extent to which the recipient thought that the message had been edited before it was sent. Polite messages, gram- matical messages, and the polite/grammatical combination all were perceived as having been edited when compared to the other types. The attribute known as \"reactions\" examined whether or not the recipient of the message believed that the sender of the message cared how the recipient was going to react to the message. As has been seen several times, participantssaw the sender as being more concerned withthe recipient when themessages were polite, grammatical, or both.DISCUSSIONThis research examined whether characteristics such as the nature of the request and the format of the request would effect the way a sender ofe-mail would be perceived by the recipient of that message. Significantly consistent results were found for both the main attributes examined (power, gender and competency) as well as a set of additional attributes(relative power, willingness to work with, friendliness, likeability, degree to which the message had been edited, and reaction to the message).The first finding that should be of interest to those doing research viaelectronic methods is that this study found no reliable differences on any of the variables examined between those who responded electronically and those who completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. Although this result is contrary to that suggested by Sproull (1986; Sproull & Kies ler,1986), who suggested that the relative anonymity of e-mail should lead to more extreme responses, itis consistent with recent research. Forexample, Penrod and O'Neil (2000) found no differences between web- based and pencil-and-paper questionnaires and Schuster, Birky, and Sharkin (2000) present data that questions the assertion of more self-disclosure in electronic communication when compared to more tra- ditional methods. Perhaps the self-disclosure difference between face-to- face versus computer-mediated communication has disappeared in the past 15 years. Or perhaps the differences can be explained in terms of the samples usedSproull and her colleagues used employees of a Fortune 500 company while the current study was conducted with college students as participants.Contrary to Sproull and Kiesler's (1986) results, impolite messages were seen by the participants in this study as originating with people ofhigher status or power. As with the method of presentation discussion, however, the nature of our sample must be kept in mind. Students use e- mail primarily for social discourse and are likely to have had littleexperience receiving mail from individuals with different degrees of status and power. Therefore, they could quite likely have made use of social schemas or stereotypes when responding to this question. Since 342NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY impoliteness is often associated with people of high status in film and ontelevision, the students may have replied accordingly.On the other hand, competency was judged to be higher in both politeand grammatical messages. This is somewhat odd given the findings onstatus since there is some research (Lee, 1996) that suggests that statusand competency are linked. However, they are in agreement with thematerial presented by Sherwood (1998) who maintained that the clarityof a person's communication in e-mail effects the assumptions that therecipient makes about the sender of that message. Polite and grammaticalmessages are likely to be seen as being clearer than impolite andungrammatical e-mail. In addition, Garton and Wellman (1995) notedthat people become less efficient when they use email. Hence, asefficiencylevels drop grammatical accuracy isalsoapt to drop.However, more competent individuals should be able to maintain theiruse of correct grammar, even when using e-mail.Messages that were impolite were also seen as being authored bymales, while females were the perceived authors of the polite messages.These results are consistent with the work of Lakoff (cited in Rodino,1997). Lakoff contends that women's language is extremely polite andtraditionally women have been stereotyped as being mild mannered,while men are stereotypically less mannered and more aggressive.As predicted, grammatical messages were seen as being authored bywomen, while males were perceived as authoring the ungrammaticalmessages. This agrees with Feingold (1993), who reported that femalechildren perform better than male children on verbal tasks, includingreading, spelling, and grammar. Therefore, when asked to make ajudgement based solely on the content of an e-mail message, we are morelikely to see grammatical messages as originating from a woman than aman.In addition to the major variables examined in this study, sixadditional impressions of the sender were elicited from the participants.These included issues of relative power and working preferences, howfriendly and likable the sender was, as well as perceptions about the carethe sender took in editing the message and whether the sender cared howthe recipient was going to react to the message. For all of these attributesexcept relative power, the polite message was viewed more positivelythan the impolite message. That is, people who send polite e-mailmessages are seen as being more friendly and likable; recipients want towork with them; the sender is seen as having edited his or her messageand is interested in the reaction of the recipient to the e-mail. The sameresults were seen on all attributes, even the relative power of the sender,when grammar was examined. That is, those sending grammaticalmessages were perceived as being friendlier and likable, recipients want Jessmer & AndersonPOLITENESS & GRAMMAR 343 to work with them, and the sender is seen as having edited his or hermessage and is interested in the reaction of the recipient to the e-mail. Inaddition, grammatical messages were seen as having originated fromindividuals of higher relative power or status when compared to therecipient. .The one exception to this trend was that impolite messages were seenas coming from individuals who had more relative power than therecipient. Since this result is consistent with the main findings on status,it appears that both questions were tapping into the same attitude.(Recall that one question asked if the sender has a position of power inthe company while the second, the one discussed here, asked if thesender had more power than the recipient did.)Given these main effects, the expected pattern appeared in theinteractions. If polite messages are seen in a more favorable light andgrammatical messages are as well, those messages that are both politeand grammatical should receive the highest ratings, and they did. Thelone exception concerns relative power. Here the highest ratings wereseen with messages that were grammatical but impolite.These results indicate that in addition to being polite, senders of e-mail should be clear, i.e., use proper grammar, in what they are saying.The attributes addressed here clearly play a role in determining howpeople are perceived when there are few contextual cues present. Anddespite the dramatic increases in speed and carrying capacity, e-mail (andother means of computer mediated communication) will continue forsome time in the future to provide many fewer cues as to status, gender,etc., than face-to-face communication.Despite the strong and seemingly straightforward findings of thisresearch, a number of potential threats to ecological validity must beacknowledged. The sample was relatively small and homogeneous andconsisted of a convenience sample of college students. In addition,division into paper-and-pencil and e-mail groups was done on a self-selection basis rather than randomly (although the consistency of theresults between the two groups does suggest that on the measures takehere, at least, the groups did not differ). And, of course, the collegestudents were asked to \"imagine that they had received the e-mail at theirplace of work.\" Perhaps the use of these artificial stimuli in this contrivedsituation should be considered an interesting finding but one that needs tobe explored and validated in real-life situations involving working menand women. 344NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY REFERENCESAdkins, M., & Brashers, D.

Papers may encompass a wide variety of topics, methods,and strategies. It is our belief that many good scientific papers arerejected for invalid reasons. Some journals reject up to 90% of theirsubmissions because they don't have space. Furthermore, studies ofthe review process strongly suggest that not all of the lucky 10% arebetter papers than those that get rejected. In our view many of thoserejected papers are meritorious with need for only minor revisions.Perhaps our philosophy can be summed up this way: we are lookingfor ways to strengthen good papers rather than searching for weakexcuses to reject them. 352 erican Vol. 3, No. 32001353YAVAILABLE Advisory Editorial Board ADRIAN FURNHAMPsychologyUniversity College LondonDOUGLAS JACKSONPsychologyUniversity University McCUTCHEON How to Subscribe toThe North American Journalof PsychologyAll subscriptions are on a calendar year basis only.

I amproud of the fact that NAJP has grown in both the number of articles andpage output each year. I am also pleased with the quality of the workbeing submitted.Thanks again to all the reviewers, all of whom did a marvelous job ofcritiquing papers promptly and with great insight. Without our reviewers,this journal would simply not have the quality it has today.This issue features an article by Ernest Hartmann and his colleagues.Dr. Hartmann is famous for his work on thin and thick boundaries.Forensic psychologist Russell Eisenman offers his insights on theChandra Levy case, and Mike Nielsen, an acknowledged expert on thepsychology of religion, weighs in with words of wisdom on therelationship between terrorism and Islam.The November issue of Monitor on Psychology contained a newsbrief that I would like to share with you. A conference paper by Hartleyand Sotto compared influential papers in psychology versus a controlgroup of less influential papers. They found that the influential paperstended to contain shorter, easier-to-read sentences. In other words, theywere easier to understand. As an editor I have encouraged clearcommunication and discouraged the temptation to show off one'svocabulary. I am hardly a neutral observer, but I think that NAJP authorshave succeeded admirably in producing articles that are quite readable.Thanks to all the authors who have made NAJP's first three years sosuccessful.Lynn E. McCutcheon, editor Boundaries BuffaloBoundaries of one kind or another are of obvious importance in our lives.What we will discuss here is the concept of the thickness of boundariesthin versus thick boundaries as a dimension of personality. Theconcept was developed as a dimension of personality, and we will reviewmany studies relating thickness of boundaries with a variety of otherpersonality measures, as well as other psychological measures, in normalas well as clinical populations. We will discuss a great deal of workrelating bounearies to measures of sleep and dreaming. We will examineboundaries in clinical populations and in persons who have unusualmystical or paranormal experiences. We will discuss the fact thatalthough thick vs. thin boundaries is basically a personality dimension ortrait measure, there are nonetheless also intra-individual differences inboundary functioning. We all function in a more thick boundary mannerat certain times and in a more thin boundary manner at other times. Wewill address, or at least approach, an understanding of the biology ofboundaries, and we will examine some broader implications of theconcept of boundaries.The Concept of Boundaries in the Mind Thin and ThickBoundariesThe basic underlying notion is a fairly obvious one. No matter howwe think of the content of our minds whether we think in everydayterms of thoughts, feelings, memories; in cognitive psychology terms ofperceptual, semantic and memory processes (or \"modules\"); or perhapsin psychoanalytic terms of ego, id, superego, defenses, etc. we arespeaking of parts, or regions or processes, which in some sense can beconsidered separate from one another, and yet which are obviouslyconnected. The boundaries between them are not absolute separations.Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Ernest Hartmann, TuftsUniversity School of Medicine, 27 Clark St., Newton, MA 02459.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 3, 347-368.NAJP358 Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES348 The boundaries can be relatively thick or solid on the one hand, andrelatively thin or permeable on the other hand.Psychologists have discussed and explored many different aspects ofboundaries. These include perceptual boundaries, boundaries related to thoughts and feelings, boundaries between states of awareness orconsciousness, sleep-dream-wake boundaries, boundaries related tomemory, body boundaries, interpersonal boundaries, boundaries relatedto sexual identity and other forms of identity, group boundaries, andboundaries in opinions and judgments. All of this has been discussed ingreat detail elsewhere (Hartmann, 1991).The concept of thick versus thin boundaries as a personality measurebecomes most clear if we examine the many kinds of boundaries, as inTable 1, and consider extreme examples for clarity. A person who hasvery thick boundaries in all senses would be someone with a sharp senseof focus, who can easily concentrate on one thing while ignoring others.This person does not experience synesthesia, keeps thoughts and feelingsentirely separate (\"I don't let my feelings get in the way of mythinking\"), and is absolutely clear about when s/he is awake, or asleep ordreaming, experiencing no in between states. This person has a clearsense of the separation of past, present, and future (\"that was then, this isnow\"), has a very definite sense of space around him/herself (\"this is myspace, this is yours\"), and has a very clear, delineated sense of sexualidentity (\"I am a man, you are a woman, vive la difference\"), groupidentity (\"this is my group, we do such and such; other groups are totallydifferent) and tends to see the world in terms of black versus white, usversus them, good versus evil.A person at the other extreme, a person with thin boundaries in allsenses, may experience synesthesia, will tend to let a lot of sensorymaterial in at once, and may have difficulty focusing on one part of theinput. This person will tend to be aware of thoughts and feelings together(\"I can't imagine a thought without a feeling\"), and will often experiencestates of being half-awake and half-asleep. Or this person will becomedeeply immersed in daydreaming or in reverie, so that sometimes theboundary between real life and fantasy may be unclear. There will be lesssense of clear body boundary and personal space. This person may bevery aware of the past, and have it blend with the present (\"I am grown-up, but in a lot of ways I'm still a child\"). Similarly, this person willaccept mixtures in sexual identity (\"I am a man, but there's a lot offeminine in me too\"). He or she will not feel solidly a member of onegroup, but rather be an individual taking part transiently in many groups,or perhaps a \"citizen of the world.\" In judgments or opinions about theworld, this person will tend to think in terms of shades of gray, rather359 Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES349 than black and white (\"it all depends, s/he's good in some ways and badin others,\" \"it's different at different times,\" and so on).These, ofcourse, are extremes. Most of us are somewhere in be-tween, a mixture of thin and thick boundaries, but this gives a flavor ofthe personality dimension running from very thick to very thin, whichhas recently been quantified using the Boundary Questionnaire (seebelow).Precursors of the Boundary ConceptNothing under the sun is entirely new. The concept of thin and thickboundaries is related in some way to a number of previous dimensionsand dichotomies. For instance, William James (1907) people into\"tough minded empiricists,\" and \"tender minded rationalists.\" KurtLewin, in the 1930s, diagramed the mind as a number of regions actingon one another, separated by divisions of various thickness (Lewin,1936). Freud discussed boundaries only a few times, especially when hespeaks of the stimulus barrier or \"reitzschutz\" a protective shieldagainst stimulation. He referred to the entire ego as initially a body-egoderived from the body surface (Freud, 1923). Many of Freud's followersdid explore boundaries in more detail (see for instance Fedem 1952).There is an entire literature on \"ego boundaries\" which definitely formpart of what we are speaking of here. In the psychoanalytic literature,solid ego boundaries are considered a kind of ideal, and the emphasis ison defects and weaknesses in ego boundaries which lead to psychosis orother pathological conditions (this is quite different from the view of thinand thick boundaries as a value-free personality dimension, which wedevelop below). A French psychoanalyst, Anzieu, has worked clinicallywith the concept of the \"ego skin\" (moi pau) as an \"envelope for theego,\" (Anzieu, 1987). He is obviously speaking of boundaries too.Clinical psychoanalysts have generally made no attempts to quantifythese boundary measures. Such attempts have, however, been made bysuch as Blatt, and Ritzier (1974), using the Rorschach. Peter Landis hasstudied ego boundaries in detail and developed some ingenious tests forego and interpersonal boundaries (Landis, 1970). All of these measurescan be related to thin versus thick boundaries. Fisher and Cleveland(1968) have worked extensively with two measures, \"Barrier,\" and\"Penetration,\" based on the Rorschach test. Theoretcally, \"Barrier\"ought to be closely related to thick boundaries and \"Penetration\" to thinboundaries. However, empirically, this is not the case. The \"Barrier\" and\"penetration\" measures turn out not to be opposites (Fisher andCleveland, 1968), and further, neither seems closely related to thick andthin boundaries (Fisher, 1992, unpublished manuscript).360 Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES350 Rokeach (1960), in his the \"open and closed mind,\" was clearly dealing withan aspect of boundaries, as were Adorno and hiscolleagues in their classical work on the \"authoritarian personality\"(Adomo, Frenkel-Brunswik Levinson,. & Sanford, 1950). The \"closed mind\" and the \"authoritarian personality\" definitely describe aspects of people with very thick boundaries.Finally, thick and thin boundaries may be relevant to different styles of organizing mentalcontents. In different ways, Mednick (1962),Spence (1964) and Broadbent (1971) distinguish between a conscious, logical, hierarchical style of conceptual organization, on the one hand, and a preconscious, connotative, parallel processing style of conceptualganization on the other. Each style may serve important defensive as wellas adaptive purposes. By being neat, explicit, and well organized, peoplewith thick boundariescan reduce the chances of different conceptsbecoming confused with each other; perhaps at the cost of not seeingnovel connections between them (Mednick, 1962). Thick boundaries can be used defensively to avoid seeing connections between related ideas. While thin boundaries between concepts permit novel and sometimescreative associations between normally unrelated ideas, thin boundariesmay be implicated in confused and autistic thinking. In this regard, acognitive style, category width, (Gardner, Holzman, Klein, Linton and Spence, 1959) has to do with the number of diverse objects a person can tolerate as belonging to thesame category or group. To consider twodifferent things as belongingto the same group, the conceptualboundaries between them must be relaxed. Thus, we believe that thin and thick boundaries representan important and pervasive personalitydimension.The Boundary Questionnaire (BQ)The BQ is a 138-item questionnaire including items about many different aspects of boundaries (Hartmann, 1989, 1991; Hartmann, Harrison, Bevis, Hurwitz, Holevas, Dawani, 1987). Table 1 gives some illustrative items, divided into 12 categories. The Boundary Quest- ionnaire has now been \"taken\" by over 2000 persons in our own studies, and several thousandmore in a number of other investigations. Theresponse format for each question runs from '0' (= not at all) to '4'very much so). Approximately two thirds of the items are phrased so that full endorsement (very much so) indicates a 'thin' boundary, and the remaining items are phrasedso that 'very much so' indicates a thickboundary. To score the test, the answer-values of the thick 'items' arereversed, and all of the scaled answers are added to produce a Sumboundscore. In a sample of 866 participants, gathered from various sources (specific thin and thick-boundary groups, college students) the correla- Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES351 TABLE 1 Boundary Questionnaire: Examples of ItemsCategory 1: Sleep/Dream/Waking1.When I awake in the morning, I am not sure whether I am reallyawake for a few minutes.Category 2: Unusual Experiences61.

The alphareliability for the test is .925. All 138 items load positively on the firstprincipal component, and the Armor theta reliability (Armor, 1973-4) is0.927. Since 'agreement-set,' the tendency to agree, was controlled byreversing the scoring direction of one third of the questions, theuniformly positive loadings attest to the idea that there is one (over-arching) principle underlying subjects' responses to all 138 questions.The BQ has good test-retest reliability over six months ( r's of about .77in two samples questions, using principal-components factor-extraction. UsingCattell's (1946) 'scree' and subsequent interpretability as criteria,thirteen factors, accounting for 37.3% of the variance, were preserved forrotation using the Normal Varixnax criterion. The 13th eigenvalue was Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES352 1.65. Items loading 0.25 or above on a given factor were regarded asbelonging to it. The first 12 rotated factors were easily interpreted; the13th was un-interpretable, its 8 items accounting for less than 1% of thetotal variance. The content of each factor appears in Table 2 (Harrison etal., 1989).TABLE 2 Summary of the Factor Analysis (from Harrison et al., 1989)Factor 1-13, Primary Process Thinking:The 51 items in this factor (all keyed in the 'thin' boundary direction) describe a personwho has many experiences of merging; of fluctuating identity; whose imagery is so vivid itis hard to distinguish from reality; who experiences synaesthesia; the merging of objectswith self and with each other. 49 of the items are keyed 'True'. Theta reliability (seeArmor 1973-4) = .92.Factor 11-13, Preference for Explicit Boundaries*:The 37 items on this factor (36 keyed in the 'thick' boundary direction) express apreference for clear borders whether it is in nation, cities, houses, pictures, stories, orrelationships. A secondary emphasis is on neatness. 34 of the items are keyed 'True'.Theta = .87.Factor 111-13, Identification with Children:The 19 items in this factor (18 keyed 'thin') describe a person who feel;, in part, like achild; identifies with children and enjoys them. All items are keyed 'True'. Theta = .75.Factor N -13, Fragility:The 13 items in this factor (12 keyed 'thin') express sensitivity to hurt, a difficult andcomplicated childhood and adolescence, fears of falling apart and fears of beingoverwhelmed by interpersonal involvement. 12 keyed 'True'. Theta = .75.Factor V-13, Clairvoyance:The 16 items on this factor (14 keyed 'thin') include beliefs in one's clairvoyant powersincluding knowing others' unexpressed thoughts and feelings, having premonitory dreams,and experiencing very vivid memories and imagery. These items also suggest a strongsense of self-identity from childhood through old age. 15 of the items are keyed 'True'.Theta = .70.Factor VI -13, Open-ness:The 11 items on this factor (all keyed 'thin') describe a person who belleves in being opento the world, trusting others, and disclosing personal experience. 10 of the 11 items arekeyed 'True'. Theta = .70. To determine the stability of the factor solution, we re-factored theBQ for 364 college students in the sample only, and found an almost-identical factor-structure. Factor-loadings for this sub-sample were within 0.02 of those found for the total group (Harrison et al,unpublished). Even more recently, a new factor analysis on 500 students Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES353 has replicated the original results with an almost identical factor structure(Zborowski, 2001, Personal Communication).Boundary scores can be obtained for each of the individual categoriesand factors. However, the most used measure has been the overallboundary score called Sumbound, in which high numbers signifythinness. In the first 1000 subjects studied, the range has been 120-454,the mean value 271 \u00b1 50.Who has Thick or Thin BoundariesA number of interesting findings have emerged as to who may becharactt 'zed by thick or thin boundaries. First, even though the itemswere very carefully written to have no gender bias, women consistentlyscore significantly \"thinner\" (one half of a standard deviation) than men,and there is also a slight age effect: older subjects score slightly thickerthan younger subjects (Harrison et. al.. 1987 Personal Communication,Hartmann, 1991). However, no long-term studies have been done as yetto determine how boundaries develop and change over the years within asingle person.Significantly thinner boundaries compared to control groups havebeen found in art students (Beal, 1989, Hartmann, 1991), music students,and mixed groups of creative persons (Beal, 1989), frequent dreamrecallers (Hartmann, 1991, Hartmann Elkin, & Garg Levin, Galin, & Zywiak 1991; Galvin,1993), adolescents with nightmares (Cowen and Levin, 1995), \"luciddreamers\" (Galvin, 1993), male as well as female fashion models (Ryan2000),personswithunusualmysticalexperiences(KrippnerWickrainasekera, Wickramasekera, & Winstead, 1998), and persons witha diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder, Schizoid PersonalityDisorder or Schizotypal Personality Disorder (Hartmann, 1991). In-terestingly, although art students have much thinner boundaries thanaverage, this is not true of established artists, who have boundary scoresin the normal range (Beal, 1989).Groups that score significantly \"thicker\" than average on the BQinclude naval officers, salespersons, lawyers, patients with a diagnosis ofObsessive-compulsive Personality Disorder, persons suffering from\"Alexythymia\" (Hartmann, 1991), and patients (from two different sleepdisorders centers) with a diagnosis of Sleep Apnea (Hartmann, 1992).The Relationship of the BQ to Other Personality MeasuresWhen the BQ was first used in 1985, it appeared to be a newdimension of personality, not clearly related to any of the then standardpersonality measures. Thus, there are only low and non-significantcorrelations between BQ and Eysenck's personality dimensions, although Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES354 one study found some relationship between thin boundaries andNeuroticism in a small group (Sand and Levin, 1996). There were also noclear relationships to Cloninger's three dimensions of personality.The BQ did show some relationships with MMPI scales (Hartmann,1991). In 299 subjects, relationships found were very consistent withwhat we had predicted on the basis of the definition of boundaries.Sumbound correlated positively (r = .32) with the F (\"atypical response\")scale, and this appeared to be a valid relationship. Subjects scoringthinner on the Boundary Questionnaire did frequently report and discussthe unusual experiences described on the F scale, for instance, \"I have anightmare every few days.\" Sumbound showed a negative relationship (r= -.37) with the K scale (\"defensiveness,\"), which can be considered anaspect of thick boundaries. Sumbound correlated positively (r =.41) withPa (paranoia), which is not surprising, since it is accepted that Pa innormal groups measures a kind of sensitivity rather than blatant paranoia.Finally, Sumbound correlated positively (r = 0.40) with the Mf scale inmalesconsistent with the view that thin boundaries involves theability for males to be interpersonally sensitive, and to see feminineelements in themselves. Although these were highly significant cor-relations, all p < .001, the modest size of the correlation suggests that theBQ is obviously measuring something different than these individualMMPI scales.Significantpositivecorrelations have beenreported between Sumbound on the BQ andsuggestibility (Barrett, 1989, Rader, Kunzendorf, and Carrabino 1996),as well measures of creativity (Levin, Galen, & Zywisk 1991). Anespecially strong correlation (r = .67) has been found between Sumboundand Tellegen's Absorption Scale (Barrett 1989). Again, these rela-tionships were as predicted from our description of thin boundaries,above.On the Rorschach test, subjects with thinner boundaries were foundto have significantly higher boundary disturbance scores, and also sig-nificantly lower form quality scores (Levin, Gilmartin, & Lamontonaro1998-1999). Recent studies have established a relationship between thinboundaries and a number of other measures relating to personality,including certain forms of anxiety. An especially strong relationship isfound between Sumbound and Insecure Attachment, measured on theBell Object Relations and Reality Testing Inventory (Bell ,Billington &Becker 1986). (Hartmann and Zborowski, 2001). Thir. boundaries arealso related to measures of connection-seeking, at least inwomen (Bevis, 1986). And there is a high correlation (r = .51) betweenthin boundaries and ratedopenness in an interview study (Zborowski,Hartmann, & Newsom 2001, Manuscript submitted for publication).365 Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES355 There have been two separate investigations relating the BoundaryQuestionnaire to the Myers-Briggs Inventory. In both studies the moststriking finding was a positive correlation (r between .4 &.5) betweenSumbound and \"Intuition,\" and a somewhat smaller correlation with\"Feeling\" (Erhman and Oxford, 1995, Barbuto & Plummer 1998, 2000).A few preliminary studies suggested that the BQ was unrelated toNorman's basic Five-Factor structure of personality. However the FiveFactor Model has evolved, and the more recent model championed byCosta and McRae (1992), includes, as one of the five dimensions,\"Openness to Experience.\" McRae (1994) has recently reported a veryhigh correlation (r = .73) between thinness of boundaries on the BQ(Sumbound) and Openness to Experience. We have attempted to furtherexamine thissurprisingly highcorrelation.Indeed the BoundaryQuestionnaire includes at least two items \"I am a very open person\" and\"I am a very sensitive person\" which plainly relate to items in \"Opennessto Experience.\" And in fact, factor VI of the BQ was named \"open-ness\"long before the relationship of the BQ to \"Openness to Experience\" wasknown. A detailed examination of the items in the \"Openness toExperience\" scale is also revealing. The items involve several aspects ofboundaries, but emphasize the desirable or positive aspects of thinboundaries. For instance, \"I have a lot of intellectual curiosity,\" \"I oftenenjoy playing with theories or abstract ideas,\" and (scored negatively) \"Ihave little interest in speculating on the nature of the universe or thehuman condition.\" Openness to Experience does not include any of theless attractive aspects of thin boundaries, such as feeling overwhelmed byinput, vulnerability, becoming over-involved in a maladaptive way, etc.Thin Boundaries and Openness to Experience are obviously closelyrelated, but in our opinion thick versus thin boundaries represents abroader and perhaps more useful measure since it is neutral or value-freeand covers both adaptive and maladaptive features.In this connection it is interesting that BQ shows close to zerocorrelation with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability scale (Earle1992). Overall, neither thin nor thick boundaries are considered moredesirable than their opposite. However, a careful examination of theanswers and a series of interviews has convinced us that by and largepeople consider their own type of boundary structure as most desirable.Thus, people with very thick boundaries tend to use terms for others withthick boundaries such as \"solid,\" \"reliable,\" \"lots of perseverance,\" etc.,while characterize people with thin boundaries as \"flaky,\" \"far out,\"\"unreliable.\" People who themselves score very thin on the BQ speak ofthose with thick boundaries as \"dull,\" \"rigid,\" \"unimaginative,\" whilethey think of those with \"exciting,\" \"creative,\"\"innovative.\" Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES356 Thin Boundaries and Unusual SensitivitiesThere are a number of suggestive studies indicating that people withthin boundaries may be not only creative and open, but may have a seriesof other interesting and so far poorly understood characteristics. Forinstance, there appears to be a relationship between thin boundaries andmultiple chemical sensitivities (Jawer, 2001). There is also a correlationbetween thin boundaries and a belief in or tendency to experienceparanormal phenomena. Factor V of the BQ appears to pick up thisaspect of thin boundaries and has been labeled \"clairvoyance.\" Groups ofpeople who characterize themselves as shamans or BQ (Krippner, Wickramasekera, Wickramasekera, & Winstead,1998). Thalbourne and his collaborators, in their studies of persons whoexperience paranormal phenomena, have devised a \"Transliminalityscale\" to measure these traits ( Lange, Thalbourne, Houran, & Storm2000; Thalbourne, 1991). Preliminary analysis suggests a high cor-relation (r = .68) between thin boundaries and the Transliminality Scale.These relationships may be worth exploring further, since two verydifferent hypotheses may explain them. The most parsimonious viewwould be that all \"paranormal\" phenomena are imaginary, and thatpeople with thin boundaries simply have better or looser imaginations,are more suggestible, or are more sensitive with a tendency to elaboratecreatively on their sensitivities. On the other hand, we could consider thepossibility that phenomena such as telepathy, now considered paranormalcould be related to transmission of information using perhaps portions ofthe electromagnetic spectrum which we are not usually able to detect.Under unusual circumstances our ability to detect such information couldbe altered slightly, and quite possibly there might be inter-individualdifferences in the ability to detect information of this kind. If so, it ispossible that persons with thin boundaries who are sensitive in so manyother ways, may also be sensitive to detecting such portions of thespectrum.Along these lines, psychologist Daryl Bem, who was until recently askeptic about any kind of paranormal experiences, careilly reviewed allquantitative studies of these phenomena and came to the conclusion thatthere is indeed something worth studying. Bem and Honorton (1994) ina paper called \"Does PSI Exist?\" interpret the overall statistical results assuggesting that there is a small positive effect, especially in studies oftelepathy and clairvoyance, which they can not attribute to chance, poorstudy design, etc. They also comment that the results are most positivewhen the subjects used are artists or creative people (in other words,probably people with thin boundaries). Certainly nothing is proven, butwe suggest that anyone considering a careful quantitative study of \"psi\" Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES357 or paranormal phenomena should consider using people with thinboundaries as subjects.Clinical BoundariesBoundaries in PsychotherapyAlthough psychotherapists have been making use of concepts such asego-boundaries and interpersonal boundaries for many years, there hasnot been much quantitative study or much attempt to relate therapy to theBQ. One small survey suggests that people with high Sumbound scores(thin boundaries) are much more likely to value psychotherapy, to havebeeninvolvedinpsychotherapy,andtohavebenefitedfrompsychotherapy (Hartmann, 1996). One paper discussed thick and thinboundaries in relation to \"boundary violations\" in therapy. The con-clusion is that victims of sexual boundary violations tended to be persons(usually women) with thin boundaries. Interestingly, it appeared that theviolators of boundaries (therapists who had sex with their patients) couldbe divided into two distinct groups, one group with unusually thinboundaries, and another group with very thick boundaries. The firstgroup consisted of therapists who were themselves somewhat confusedand unclear about rules and limits in psychotherapy and elsewhere. Thesecond group consisted of therapists who were not confused, but knewexactly what they were doing. They were solid, \"thick-boundary\" peoplewho lacked empathy, and were not able to appreciate the pain andsuffering that might be experienced by the patient involved in theboundary violation (Hartmann, 1997).We have repeatedly found that an explicit discussion of boundariescan be very useful in psychodynamic therapy.. This is especially the casein patients who have relatively thin boundaries, or at least thinboundaries in some areas, and are painfully aware of this when it iscalled to their attention.It is often useful for them to think of theirproblems in terms of boundaries being thin in certain areas, and perhapsneeding thickening. Further, they appreciate the fact that they are in thissense similar to art students and other creative persons. The same patientsoften react poorly to being labeled with diagnoses such as \"BorderlinePersonality Disorder,\" or \"Schizotypal Personality Disorder\" which havea great many negative connotations for the patient and sometimes thetherapist.Boundaries and DreamsThere have been a large number of studies relating boundaries tovarious aspects of dreams. First of all, there is a clear and significantpositive relationship between thinness of boundaries and amount ofdream recall in various normal and clinical samples (Hartmann, 1991,Hartmann Elkin, & Garg 1991; & Gell, 1996; Schredl, Schafer, & Hoffman1999;). This relationship holds in an adolescent population as well(Cowen and Levin, 1995). In most studies, dream recall was measured bya single question, but a study involving dream diaries obtained similarresults (Schredl et.al., 1996). This relationship has been replicated anumber of times, and holds true even when all items on the BQ relatingto dreams, daydreams, sleep, and waking are removed (Hartmann, 1991).In the pastithas been strikinglydifficult to obtain consistentrelationships of dream recall with any personality measures. In fact, thepositive relationship with thinness on the BQ is at present the only well-replicated correlate of dream recall. Although the results are highlysignificant, the magnitude of the r's (usually 0.2 to 0.5) indicates that,obviously, much variance is left to be explained. Part of this variance iscertainly \"noise in the system\" the fact that simply asking people asingle question about how often they recall a dream is a very roughmeasure. Many peopleprobably the majorityhave thought littleabout their dreams or amount of dream recall, and their answer to thequestion is only a wild guess. In fact, one study showed that thecorrelation between dream recall and thinness on the BQ is much higherin persons who are especially interested in their dreams members ofthe Association for the Study of Dreams. The correlation between BQscore and dream recall was .58 in this subgroup (N = 42;), whereas it was.40 in the larger, unselected group of 600 persons (Hartmann, 1991).Dream recall shows a significant positive correlation not only withthe overall BQ score SumBound, but with each of the twelve categoriesof boundaries. Also, a group of frequent dream recallers (seven dreams ormore per week) scores significantly higher on SumBound and on each ofthe twelve categories of the BQ than a group of persons who say they donot recall dreams (Hartmann, 1991; Hartmann, et al, 1991). Further, theBQ is related to aspects of the content of dreams: dreams of subjects withthin boundaries are scored as more vivid, more dreamlike, more emo-tional, and having more interactions between characters (Hartmann et al,1991; Hartmann et al. 1998). Similar findings on dream content are reported by Schredl et al.1996). In another study, Sumbound waspositively correlated McNamara, Hartmann, Murphy& Mottle 1998).There is also a relationship between boundaries and the CI score (ameasure of the power of imagery in the dream in whien there has beenconsiderable recent interest. CI refers to a \"Contextualizing Image.\" Forinstance, a person who has recently experienced trauma of any kind oftenhas dreams such as \"I was overwhelmed by a tidal wave.\" The powerful369. Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES359 tidal wave imagery is thought to contextualize or picture the underlyingemotion of terror or vulnerability (Hartmann, 1996, 1998). CI scoreshave good inter-rater reliability, and have been found to be significantlyhigher in dreams than in daydreams (Hartmann, Rosen & Grace 1998),and higher in the dreams of people who have experienced trauma orabuse than those who have not (Hartmann, Zborowki, Rosen & Grace2001). Concerning boundaries, it was found that a group of students whoscored thin on the BQ had significantly higher CI scores in their written\"most recent dreams\" than students who scored thick (Hartmann,Zborowski, McNamara, Rosen & Grace, 1999).Galvin (1993) found that lucid dreamers persons who frequentlyrealize they are dreaming during their dreams have thin boundarieswith scores in about the same range as nightmare sufferers. However, thetwo groups differ on factor 10 of the BQ: the nightmare group is more\"over-involved.\"Aside from the relationship with dreaming, there are also someintriguingpreliminaryfindingssuggestingrelationshipsbetweenboundaries and other aspects of sleep and sleep disorders. Overall, thereis a small but significant correlation between thinness of boundaries andlength of sleep (Hartmann, 1991). Indeed, persons classically describedas \"short sleepers\"people who get along on 6 hours or less of sleepper night, do not catch up, and do not have any complaints of insomniaappear to have many characteristics of people with thick boundaries,though the BQ was not available at the time of the sleep studies(Hartmann, Baekland, & Zwilling 1972).Among people with sleep disorders, we have mentioned that thosewho havefrequentnightmareshaveunusuallythinboundaries(Hartmann, 1984, 1991). This relationship has been studied and con-firmed (Zborowski et al, 1998). However, persons who have a verydifferent condition, night terrors early night frightening awakeningswithout dreamsas well as those with sleepwalking (sometimesassociated with night terrors) tend to have thick boundaries. Patientssuffering from bruxism (tooth-grinding) tend to have thicker boundariesthan average, as do patients with sleep apnea, as mentioned (Hartmann,1991, 1992).Boundary Changes Within an Individual: the Focused-Waking-to-Dreaming ContinuumWe have chiefly discussed thin vs. thick boundaries as a personalitytrait, and in fact most studies have focused on boundaries in this way.However, it is interesting to note that thickness of boundaries may alsovary within an individual at different times or in different states. We have 370 Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES360 studied this variation, especially as related to the focused waking todreaming continuum as follows.In the studies above and the usual conceptualization, dreaming istreated as though it were totally separate from waking. However, a greatdeal of data suggests that it is useful to think of a continuum runningfrom focused waking on one end to dreaming at the other end. This isdiscussed in detail elsewhere (Hartmann, 1998). At the \"focused waking\"end of the continuum, the mind deals with words, mathematical symbols,logical relationships, tending to use sequential processing (A >B-->C >D), making connections in a serial fashion. At the dreaming end,the mind ishyper-connective, using loose associations, merging,condensation and so on, making connections' in a parallel or auto-associative fashion. The continuum has a clear relationship withboundaries in the senses we have discussed above. When we are wideawake engaged in focused waking activities, such as doing an arithmeticproblem, or chasing down a fly ball in the outfield, we are functioning ina thick boundary manner. We try to \"think clearly\" and make clearseparations. We carefully separate \"task\" from \"non-task,\" and one taskfrom another. When we move towards daydreaming and eventuallydreaming, categories merge, and we combine and relate things in all sortsof unusually ways. Freud's first and most important mechanism of the\"dreamwork,\" known as condensation, is exactly this a combining ofseparate items, a blurring of boundaries. Thus, we all have thinnerboundaries when we are dreaming. In this sense, the continuum fromthick boundaries to thin boundaries, can be considered not only as apersonality trait, but also a within-person state measure. A number ofstudies suggest that content from waking, especially at the reverie ordaydreaming portions of waking, are not entirely differentiable fromdreaming. One study demonstrated the relationship with the BQ. Itshowed that overall students' dreams were scored as more \"bizarre\" and\"dreamlike\" on standard scales than students' daydreams. However,students who scored thin on the BQ showed a shift to the right relative tothicker students, so that the daydreams of students who scored thin werescored just as \"bizarre\" and as \"dreamlike\" as the dreams (night dreams)of students who scored thick (Kunzendorf et al, 1997).Another study showed that in general subjects had more difficultydistinguishing visual pulses from auditory pulses under hypnosis thanwhile wide awake. This difference was stronger in subjects scoring \"thin\"on the boundary questionnaire (Kunzendorf and Maurer, 1988-89).Boundaries and the BrainIf thin versus thick boundaries represents a clear-cut personalitydimension and also an aspect of mental state functioning, one would3 Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES361 predict that thick versus thin boundary functioning should be detectableon the biological level, in terms of brain function and activity. In simpleterms, one might suggest that thin boundaries, relativeto thickboundaries, might be associated with more hyper-connectivity, perhaps amore rapid spread of activation in the forebrain, or more \"in-betweenstates.\" It has not been easy to study boundaries biologically, but a fewbeginnings have been made. For instance, in examining the poly-somnograms (all-night sleep records) of persons with very thick or verythin boundaries, we were struck by the fact that people with thickboundaries appeared to have more clear-cut states of waking, NREMsleep, and REM sleep. The records of those with thin boundaries showedmore in-between sties, or difficult-to-define states. Several researchershave had this impression, but it has not yet been validated in acompletely blind fashion with agreed-upon definitions of in-betweenstates. Along similar lines, a study by Watson (1985) investigated phasicintegrating potentials (PIPs), which are sharp spikes recorded in humansand animals,occurringchiefly during REM sleepand in factconsidered an index of the basic neurophysiology of REM sleep--butoccasionally at other times as well. Watson found a strong, positivecorrelation (r = .52) between the number of PIPs outside of REM sleepand thinness of boundaries.In other words, people with thinnerboundaries in a psychological sense, also had thinner boundaries betweenREM and NREM sleep: the brain activity characteristic of REM sleepoften \"escaped\" into NREM sleep. More work along these lines isdefinitely needed.Another small study investigated changes in skin temperature inducedby imagining warm or cold scenes (sitting by a fire or holding an icecube). Subjects who scored thin on the BQ showed a greater actualchange in skin temperature in response to these conditions (Hartmann1991). Similarly, in a group of 78 students, those who scored thin on theBQ showed mere and longer-lasting autonomic arousal (measured byskin conductance) an arousal-producing stimulus than other students(Levin and Fireman, 1993).There has been one study in which a number of neuro-psychologicaltests were administered to persons scoring either very thin or very thickon the BQ. Such tests are generally used to detect brain damage, so ofcourse large differences cannot be expected in these normal subjects. Yetsignificant differences were found in some interesting areas. Subjectsscoring thick showed more evidence of perseveration (continuing in atask or strategy when asked to change) and a more systematic approachto constructing figures. Thin boundary subjects were significantly betterat changing strategies or adopting new strategies on a number of tests(Garg and Hartmann,1993). Such differencesaresuggestive of32 Hartmann, Harrison Zborowski BOUNDARIES362 differences in functioning of the frontal cortex. To the best of ourknowledge there have as yet been no studies using imaging techniquessuch as PET or fMRI, which might be expected to show such differencesmore clearly.There are also definite hints of a neuro-pharmaco logy and neuro-chemistry of boundaries, though with no controlled studies as yet. Basedon several hundred interviews with research subjects and patients takinga number of psychoactive medications, it is clear that certain medicationsproduce a temporary thickening of boundaries. These include thestimulants and some anti-depressants. Persons with thin boundariestaking such medications repeatedly describe the effects as: \"I feel lesspulled-apart;\" \"I feel better;\" \"instead of being pulled in ten differentdirections, I can move in one straight line.\" These \"thickening\" effectsappear more prominent in people who have thin boundaries, regardless ofwhether they are normal subjects in studies, or patients with a variety ofdiagnoses.On the other hand, the effects of psychedelic drugs, especially LSD,can be interpreted as a temporary thinning of boundaries, with effectsthat include synesthesia, vivid changing imagery, dreamlike states, manythoughts or feelings simultaneously. One woman who scored very thinon the BQ said of an LSD experience, \"I can see why some people mightlike or need this sort of loosening or merging, but it's not for me. I'm toomuch like that anyway, without drugs.\"These clinical or anecdotal results suggest the probable importance ofthe biogenic amines in boundaries. They suggest especially that increasednorepinephrine (and perhaps dopamine) in the cortex can produce athickening of boundaries, whereas a lack of norepinephrine can producethinner boundaries. This is consistent with the fact that the lack ofnorepinephrine in the cortex is one of the clearest characteristics of REMsleep, when most dreaming occurs. All of this can be considered only asmall beginning to an investigation of the biology of boundaries.Overall, thick vs. thin boundaries appears to be a robust personalitymeasure that can be considered an important dimension of personality.This measure is related to, but may in some ways be broader and moreuseful than, the personality dimension \"Openness to Experience.\" Wehave discussed many correlates of thick and thin boundaries, and havealso emphasized the relationship of thick and thin boundaries to thecontinuum running from focused waking thought to dreaming. In thissense, people with thick boundaries spend more time and find themselvesmore comfortable at the left-hand end of our continuum involved infocused waking. They can be considered \"thought people,\" whereas the373 Hartmann, Harrison & Zbdrowski BOUNDARIES363 people with thinner boundaries are more comfortable at the other end ofthe continuum and can be thought of as \"dream people,\" although theseterms are obviously an over-simplification.Broader Implications of Boundaries for Society and HumanityBeyond the implications for personality, behavior, etc. mentionedabove, we would like to discuss here some broader speculations aboutboundaries in the mind. These are very difficult to investigate in con-trolled studies, and are offered principally as \"food for thought.\"Boundaries have a great deal to do with not only the organization ofour thinking, but of our societies. For instance, if we think about law, wecan see a very thick boundary position: \"this is legal, that is illegal;\" \"thisman is either innocent or guilty, that's all there is to it;\" as opposed to amore thin boundary position involving shades of gray, mitigatingcircumstances, and partial responsibility.This difference can be seen not only in law, but also more generallyin ethics. The thick position is that there is clear-cut good and clear-cutevil, while the thinner view involves shades of gray and \"situationethics.\"Quite likely aesthetics is influenced by boundaries in a somewhatsimilar way. The thick boundary position would be \"this is beautiful, thisis ugly; there are rules that tell you exactly which is which; that's allthere is to it.\" The thin boundary position might be more like, \"it's hardto tell, it all depends,\" or \"I can see something beautiful in this eventhough it looks ugly overall,\" \"it's hard to judge,\" or perhaps that theartist can transform ugliness into beauty. For instance, Rodin states,\"what is commonly called ugliness in nature can in art become full ofgreat beauty\" (Gsell, 1971).Other philosophical categories can likewise be seen differently from athick or thin boundary position. Even basic building blocks ofmetaphysics such as \"real\" vs. \"unreal\" or \"true\" vs. \"false\" may be seenin absolute terms, or in a more relativistic fashion. In an overall sense,thick boundaries can be visualized as black vs. w!iite, while thinboundaries can be thought of as various shades of gray.In general, we suggest that thick boundaries are more helpful at timesof war, threat, or danger. In fact societies or groups that feel threatened orindanger, for whatever reason, tend to develop thicker boundaries.*Thin boundaries are more helpful, or perhaps simply more possible,when there is less danger and we can \"let go.\" Along political lines, it ispossible to think of war and peace in very thick boundary terms. A \"thickboundary peace\" consists of establishing precisely the interests, theduties, the territory of the two sides, and making appropriately clearagreements: \"this is mine, this is yours; we'll set up all the walls, Hartmann, Harrison & Zborowski BOUNDARIES364 regulations, etc. that may be necessary.\" A \"thin boundary peace\" wouldbe more along the lines of joint occupations of areas, joint assemblies,flexibility, a gradual realization that \"we\" are not really so different from\"them,\" and eventually a situation where it doesn't matter much to whoma particular bit of territory belongs. This latter position is considered far-out and idealistic by much of the world, but it has occurred within theUnited States or within Switzerland, where there are continuingdisagreements between states (or cantons) as to who owns exactly whatterritory, what river rights, etc., but it is not anything to make war about.It is no longer a matter of life or death. This has also occurred recently inWestern Europe, where countries which not long ago were bitterenemies, now allow citizens to cross borders without even requiringpapers.In an adaptive sense, there are advantages to thin as well as thickboundaries. For the survival of an individual, it is certainly important tobe able to concentrate and engage in focused waking activity, but also attimes to be able to daydream or dream. For a corporation, it may beuseful to have a creative genius/inventor with an initial idea, or several atdifferent times, but then to have more thick boundary types to develop,organize, market, etc. Likewise for society as a whole, it is perhapsoptimal to contain and value individuals with thin as well as individualswith thick boundaries.

Effect of Humor on Hitchhiking: A FieldExperimentNicolas GueguenUniversite de Bretagne-Sud VannesStudies have shown that a positive mood, activated by an amusingdrawing,leadstoincreasedhelpingbehavior.Fourhitchhikingconfederates, 2 young men and 2 young women, tested 1600 motorists.Each confederate held a sign indicating the place where he/she wished togo. In half of the cases, a funny drawing (a smiling face) appeared on thesign. Contrary to my expectations, the funny drawing inhibited thehelping behavior of the motorists, but only when the hitchhiker was awoman.Multiple studies have shown that a positive mood is more conduciveto helping behavior than a Rind, 1997; Weyant, 1978). This positive mood canbe activated in many different ways and usually does not requireelaborate tools. A false attribution of success or failure in a task activatesa positive/negative mood, which, in turn, affects altruism in a way whichis congruent with the mood (Clark & Waddell, 1986). Finding a coin in aphone booth or on the ground is enough to induce a positive mood, whichin return enhances altruism (Batson, Coke, Chard, Smith & Talaferro,1979; Blevins & Murphy, 1974; 1982 Levin,1972; Isen & Simmonds, 1978; Levin & Isen, 1975). To be offeredcandy or a cookie produces the same effect (Harris & Smith, 1975; Isen& Levin, 1972).Other environmental factors also activate a positive mood, whichaffects pro-social behavior. For example, the amount of money in tipsgiven by customers increases on sunny days (Cunningham, 1979). Astudy by Rind (1996) showed that information about the weather, givenby the waiter to customers who had not yet seen the color of the sky, wassufficient to make his tip vary. Customers left the waiter a large or asmall tip depending on whether he told them it was sunny or rainy.Pleasant ambient smells (e.g. baking, cooking, roasting coffee) in a shop-ping mall led the passers-by to provide change for a dollar to a same-sexconfederate more readily than in the absence of such odors (Baron,1997). Pleasant music also plays an important part in helping behavior.Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 2, 369-376.NAJP ,BEST COPY AVAILABLE 370NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Fried and Berkowitz (1979) found that subjects who heard soothingmusic for seven minutes were more apt to accept a request for help madeimmediately afterwards by the experimenter than subjects in a no-musiccondition. Another way of inducing a mood state in a subject consists ofexposing him or her to pleasant versus unpleasant pictures or texts(Forgas, 1997; 1998). For example, drawing a smiling face on the billincreased the amount of tip money given to a waitress (Rind & Bordia,1996). In the same way, a hand-made drawing of the sun (\"smiley-face\"),added to the bottom of the bill of customers having a drink, led them toleave a larger tip for the waiters or waitresses (Gueguen & LeGoherel,2000). Attaching a small card to the bill onto which a joke was appendedproduced the same effect (Gueguen, in press).In the present study a new evaluation of the effect of a drawing was made in conjunction with one of the standard requests for help:hitchhiking. Itis known that, in this context, traditional factors ofinfluence lead to increased helping behavior. For instance, Snyder,Grether, and Keller (1974) and Morgan, Lockard, Fahrenbrugh andSmith (1975) have shown that motorists are more likely to stop ifhitchhikers look at them straight in the face than if they look somewhereelse. The effect of eye contact on various helping behaviors has beenobserved in several studies (Brockner, Pressman, Cabitt, & Kleinke, and Tedford (1972) also found that a malehitchhiker is more likely to get help when he is well-dressed. Similarly,several studies have shown that people were more likely to respond to arequest for help made by solicitors who were well-dressed (Goodman &Gareis, 1993; Kleinke, 1977; McElroy & Morrow, 1994). Pomazal andClore (1973) found that drivers were more likely to help a hitchhiker in ahigh need situation (e.g.: when the hitchhiker confederate had a physicaldisability). So, in keeping with Rind and Bordia's (1996) study, Iexpected a \"smiley\" face drawing placed on the sign indicating thehitchhiker's destination, would increase the rate of drivers who wouldstop to help the solicitor.Because research on hitchhiking has shown that females receive morerides than males (Clifford & Cleary, 1971; Pomazal & Clore, 1973;Morgan et al., 1975; Snyder et al., 1974), it was expected than femalehitchhikers would receive more help in the present experiment.METHODParticipantsParticipants were 1600 drivers, men and women, solicited at the entryof a famous peninsula (\"Presqu'Ile de Rhuys\") of Brittany in France. Thepeninsula is about kilometers long.3 8 0 GueguenHUMOR AND HITCHHIKING 371 ProcedureFour people, 2 men and 2 women, 19-21 years old, served asconfederates in this experiment. All of them were first year students fromthe Department of Business at the University of Bretagne-Sud in France,and all volunteered to participate as confederates in this experiment. Bothfemale and male confederates were selected by 2 other male and 2 otherfemale evaluators who were asked to select confederates based on theirphysical attractiveness. These evaluators were instructed to carefullyexamine photographs of students and to select people, males and females,who were average in attractiveness. After that, these students were askedto participated in the experiment. All of them accepted the solicitation ofthe experimenter. One confederate stood at the side of the road at a placewith good visibility for the motorists and with a broad berm, making thestopping and restarting of vehicles quite easy and safe. The experimenttook place between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. during weekends on particularlysunny and pleasant days at the beginning of summer. The confederateswere dressed in a casual way for young people of their age (t-shirts,jeans, and tennis shoes of light colors). Each confederate was standingalone on the side of the road, holding in his/her hand a paperboard signof 30 cm x 20 cm on which was written the name of a city locatedhalfway up of the peninsula (approximately 11 kilometers). According tothe condition, a smiling face (C)) was (or was not) drawn on the upperleft side of the sign. A pretest had shown that the drivers could see thedrawing on the sign. The confederates were instructed to always hold thesign at the same height and not to look at the drivers in the eyes, but tolook at an unknown point opposite them. If a driver stopped, theconfederate was then instructed to debrief the participant. He/sheexplained to the driver that he/she was conducted an experiment onhitchhiking. Then, the driver was warmly thanked for his help. Once 40cars had passed by (7.13 minutes waiting on average, SD = 4.46) theconfederate changed signs. When each confederate had tested 400drivers, the experiment stopped.RESULTSAll the drivers who stopped were men, rendering impossible anycomparison of the sex of the drivers. The number of drivers who stoppedis presented in Table 1, categorized according to the confederate's genderand the experimental condition. Since no differences between the con-federates of the same gender were found between the two men and thetwo women, the data were aggregated.A main effect of the confederates' gender was obtained. Generallyspeaking, female confederates were more likely to get a ride than malehitchhikers (X2 (1, N= 1600) = 14.43, p < .001). A main effect of the381 372NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY type of sign used was also observed (X2 (1, N = 1600) = 7.59, p < .01).However, contrary to my assumption, the presence of the smiley face wasassociated with a decrease in the number of drivers who offered to give a lift. A significant interaction, tested by way of a 2 (male and femaleconfederate) x 2 (no drawing/smiley face) x 2 (driver stop/no stop) log-linear analysis, between the confederates' gender and the type of signused was observed (X2 (4, N= 1600) = 23.59 p < .001). The presence ofthe smiley face did not have any effect at all on drivers' stopping rateswhen the hitchhiker was a man (X2 (1, N = 800) = 0.33, ns). In contrast,the smiley face led to decreased stopping rates when the hitchhiker was awoman (X2 (1, N = 800) = 6.82, p < .01). TABLE 1: Number of Participants who Stopped According to theType of Sign Used and the Gender of the Confederate'Sign Without DrawingSign With SmilingFaceMale ConfederatesFemale Confederates2962(7.3%)(15.5%)2435(6.0%)(8.8%)'There were 400 driversper DISCUSSIONResults of the present study showed that, ingeneral, femalehitchhikers were helped more than male hitchhikers. This finding is consistent with otherfieldexperiments conducted on hitchhiking(Clifford & Cleary, 1971; Morgan et al., 1975; Snyder et al., 1974). Inother studies more help was offered to female hitchhikers even in highneed situations. Pomazal and Clore (1973) have shown that when thehitchhiker-confederate presented a physical disability, females were helped more than males. Such results are also consistent with theliterature of helping behavior in general. When the helper is a male, awoman in apparent need tends to be helped more than a man in apparentneed (Bickman, Simon, 1976). This effect is also accentuated in a'high need situation (Juni & Rooth, 1981).Contrary to our hypothesis, the presence of the smiling face on thesign decreased the number of drivers stopping and offering rides to thehitchhiking confederates. However this phenomenon was observed only when the hitchhiker wasa woman, whereas no difference between thetwo types of sign was observed when the hitchhiker was a man. Theseresults contrast sharply with those of previous studies. Rind and Bordia GueguenHUMOR AND HITCHHIKING 373 (1996) have shown that when the \"smiley\" face appeared on the back ofcustomers' bill, it led patrons to give more tip money to a waitress. Whena waiter drew a \"smiley\" face no difference was found. In the presentexperiment, when the drawing appeared on the sign of the two maleconfederates it had no effect on the drivers stopping rate, just as it had noeffect on tipping in Rind and Bordia's study. Yet,this drawingapparently affected the drivers negatively in the present study when thehitchhiker was a woman. Of course, my research does not correspond tothat carried out by Rind and Bordia (1996) on several points. Thedependent variable was different, the subjects of Rind and Bordia were ingroups of both men and women, whereas my participants were primarilymen driving alone, as was true in other field studies conducted onhitchhiking (Forsyth, 1978; Pomazal & Clore, 1973). The two studieswere conducted in different countries (USA/France). However, thecultural difference seems an unlikely explanation, since Gueguen andLe Goherel (2000), and Gueguen (In press), showed that, in France, barcustomers reacted positively (i.e. they left larger tips to waiters andwaitresses) to a funny drawing appearing on the bill or to a joke writtenon a card accompanying the bill. In both studies, no difference wasobserved according to the server's gender.The effect observed may come from a differential reaction to thedrawing when it comes from a woman. Studies have shown that peoplereact differently to the same joke according to whether it is told by a manor a woman (Herzog,1999; Mundorf, Bhatia, Zillman, Lester &Robertson, 1988; Van Giffen & Maher, 1995). It is possible that, in thepresent study the drawing led the drivers to perceive the femaleconfederate less positively, which, in return, resulted in decreasing theirlikelihood of helping. It may also be that this decrease is due to aperception of incongruity between the smiling face and the hitchhiker'sgender.Perhaps humor on the part of a female-hitchhiker was perceived bymale drivers as a sign of less femininity because being humorous istraditionally perceived as a male characteristic (Wilson & Molleston,1981). Harris and Bays (1973) have shown that women solicitors werehelped more when wearing feminine than when wearing masculine attire.Tice and Baumeister (1985) have also found such results in an emer-gency situation. In my experiment, humor may had had the same effect.Of course, the results of the present study provide no proof for suchexplanations. In order to evaluate them, further experiments need to beconducted. The \"less positive perception\" hypothesis created by a womanhitchhiker holding a smiling face on her sign should be evaluated. In thetwo experimental conditions, photographs of the confederates could beused as a stimulus to evaluate the impression created by the hitchhiker 374NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY and the probability of stopping in such conditions. The appropriateness of humor in accordance with the confederate's gender needs to beevaluated in the same way. REFERENCESBaron, R. (1997).

Religion's Role in the Terrorist Attack ofSeptember 11, 2001Michael E. NielsenGeorgia Southern UniversityThe central role of religion in the terrorist attacks on New York andWashington, D.C., is addressed. The terrorists were motivated by amilitant fundamentalist worldview, which rejects modernism. Accordingto Osama bin Laden, corrupt Western values and mores are not to betolerated, making attacks justified. Religion's role in coping with theattacks also is described using Pargament's theoretical framework. Stepsthat individuals can take to deal constructively with the situation arelisted.Four planes were hijacked on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. Two ofthe planes were crashed deliberately into New York City's World TradeCenter towers, causing their collapse. A third plane was flown into thePentagon, outside Washington DC. The fourth plane, after a strugglebetween hijackers and passengers, crashed in a field before hitting itstarget. An untold number of people are dead as a result of these actions,which also are expected to affect people throughout the world as itsrepercussions are felt in the economic and political spheres. Clearly, thiscoordinated, concerted attack was intended to bring down symbols of USeconomic and military might. Early reports also indicate that importantcenters of US political power the White House and the president'sairplane - also were targets.Militant Fundamentalist WorldviewEvidencecurrentlypointstomilitantIslamicfundamentalistsaffiliated with Osama bin Laden. One may expect that their actions weremotivated by several factors, but we are left with an incompleteunderstanding of this group without an effort to grasp the central role ofreligion in their lives and how it influences their perception of the world.Osama bin Laden, a tall man in his mid-forties, grew up in SaudiArabia, where his father became rich in the building industry. From hisfather's inheritance bin Laden gained $250 million, which he has used tofinance and support his view of Islam. The Sunni branch of Islam is mostcommon in Arabia and in the world, and bin Laden adheres to a radicalAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Michael Nielsen,Department of Psychology, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, GA30460-8041, or at mnielsen@gasou.edu.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 3, 377-384.NAJP 378NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY fundamentalist interpretation of it. Like all of Islam, the Sunnis believe inone God, and that Muhammed was God's last prophet. Islam encourages people to be devoted to God, but also to be generous, hospitable, and to demonstrate care for others. So, the important questions for us to understand regarding the terrorist attack are \"What makes somethingfundamentalist?\" and \"How did this worldview influence the terrorist actions?\"The overarching theme to the fundamentalist, whether Muslim or Christian, is that God is to be worshipped, respected, feared & obeyed above all else. All other considerations take a back seat to God. This intense and abiding devotionmeans that there are some things that arecompletely, utterly non-negotiable. In this way, it is like viewing theworld as being black and white, with little if any gray between that whichis good and that which is evil. Accompanying this is a tendency towardliteralism. If scripture says that Noah built an ark, put two of each type of animal throughout the worldon it, and that they sailed on that boat whilethe entire earth was flooded, then it happened. No questions need beasked; it happened, regardless of whether it is logically consistent with what we know about animals, floods, ancient ships or the geological record.An important element of the fundamentalist mindset is the rejection of modernism. Contemporary western values are inconsistent with God'svalues and with His will for humanity. People's duty is to worship God, not to ignore or ridicule Him. God's rules are clear and they are to be enforced and respected, not flaunted. As a result, fundamentalists havevery conservative views on social issues. The fundamentalist finds mediaportrayals of sex, inappropriate gender roles, and many other elements of Western culture to be abominations completely out of harmony withGod's will. God does not like it, doesn't tolerate it, and neither do God's devoted followers.Bin LadenBin Laden was exiled from Saudi Arabia for his views in 1991, during the Gulf War. Bin Laden objected to the Saudi government policythat allowed infidels, US and other non-Muslim military troops, on their sacred soil (Saudi Arabia is considered sacred because the most holy of Islam's sites are located there.). By exiling bin Laden, the Saudigovernment avoided complications within its borders and with its allies. Bin Laden went to Sudan, where he used his inheritance to help the country's poor (by developing jobs, etc.), and also issaid to have continued hisefforts against thewest. In 1996, Sudan bowed tointernational pressure and exiled him. 38 NielsenTERRORISTIC ATTACK 379 From Sudan, bin Laden went to Afghanistan where he has stayeduntil the present time. For bin Laden, this was a return to Afghanistan.He went there earlier, in the mid-1980s, during the country's ten-yearwar with the Soviet Union. In 1989 the Soviet Union left, defeated, andan intense civil war raked the country. During that ongoing war, a groupknown as the Taliban gained control of the majority of Afghanistan; aseparatist faction remains in northern Afghanistan. The Taliban, whosharea deeplyrigid,radicalfundamentalist view of Islam, aresympathetic to bin Laden, and have allowed him to maintain trainingcamps to support members of his group al Qaeda. It also is important tonote that most countries never recognized the Taliban's government.Indeed, the civil war continues.Bin Laden formed the group al Qaeda (Arabic for \"The Base\") as avehicle to help him achieve his goals for Islam. The consistent theme ofthe group has been to fight against the West, most chiefly against the US,but also against countries that aid US interests. Among other things thegroup has been implicated in several terrorist attacks, perhaps mostnotably the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania whichkilled 224 people. Frequently these attacks have come after a declaration(fatwa) denouncing the US and its socio-political agenda. For example, aMay 1998 declaration entitled \"The Nuclear Bomb of Islam\" included thestatement that \"it is the duty of Muslims to prepare as much force aspossible to terrorize the enemies of God\" (Washington File, 1999). A fewmonths later, the embassies were bombed; the US responded with cruisemissile attacks in Afghanistan (bin Laden's suspected training camp) andSudan (where he stored or made the weapons believed to have been usedin the attack).It is worth mentioning that in August, 1996, bin Laden issued adeclaration of jihad. Its lengthy title makes clear bin Laden's position:\"Message from Osama bin Laden to his Muslim Brothers in the WholeWorld and Especially in the Arabian Peninsula: Declaration of Jihadagainst the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Mosques;Expel the Heretics from the Arabian Peninsula\" (Washington File, 1999).This declaration of jihad reflects the meaning that most westerners havecome to associate with the word. Jihad, however, has been called themost misunderstood word in religion today. Although we may read of itin this context, its common, usual meaning is that of a struggle to purifyoneself. In many ways, it is more appropriate to consider jihad as havingthe connotation similar to that of a fast, or going on a retreat, to aChristian.People who view bin Laden as a typical Muslim, make a seriousmistake, as do those who view any single individual as a prototypicexample of any group. For example, a selection of public figures who8 9 380NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY profess Christianity might include: Jerry Falwell, Pope John Paul II,David Koresh,BillClinton,and George W. Bush. Each claimChristianity, but few would consider each of these men to representChristianity equally well. More broadly, Aryan Nation groups that useChristianity to further their social cause of racial separation and hatredare not considered by most people to be prototypic Christians. Likewise,bin Laden is not a typical Muslim, and militant fundamentalist Muslimsare not representative of Islam.Regardless of whether it was bin Laden or someone else who coordinated the attacks, thereare more general questions for us toconsider. Why are we surprised when people act in accordance with theirreligious beliefs? This certainly isn't the first time it has happened;examples abound. In 1997, a group of 39 people known as Heavens Gatecommitted suicide. \"Heaven is a beautiful place,\" they said, and theywanted to go there. It shocked the country.During World War II, some Japanese pilots went on Kamikazemissions. Many people learned with disbelief that these pilots, with justenough fuel to reach their targets, flew directly into the enemy andsacrificed themselves in order to serve the emperor, their God. This was not the first time that extreme views have resulted inextreme behavior. Nor will it be the last, because attitudes do affectbehavior.In light of this, it is instructive to ask about attitudes and behaviorregarding the attack. How do individuals use religion to cope withdisasters such as this?Religious CopingKen Pargament (1997) describes many different ways that religionhelps people deal with traumatic, life-changing events. Examining histheory will help us make some sense of people's reactions to the attack.The basic assumption underlying Pargament's theory is that peoplesearch for significance in their lives. We are goal-directed, and try to find and hold on to the things that give our life a sense of significance andmeaning. For many people, religion provides a way to do this. It gives ussomething to strive for, and tells us how we can obtain it.Crises, however, threaten one's sense of significance (Solomon,Greenberg & Pyszczynski, 2000). They put at risk the things that arevalued, and many peopleuse religion in order to regain and maintain thatwhich is significant. It does this in two basic ways. The first method,which Pargament calls conservation, maintains the same items as beingsignificant. People prefer conservational strategies because they involveless change, less stress. The alternative, transformation, is used when390 NielsenTERRORISTIC ATTACK 381 people determine that their current sense of significance is untenable, thatthey must change their source of significance.Conservational coping comes in four general types.Religious prevention helps us maintain the sense of significance bydeclaring certain things as being off limits. Drug use and extra-maritalsex, for example, may be determined to be out of the bounds ofacceptable behavior. Avoiding these activities helps people maintain anongoing sense of purpose, that they are headed in the right direction, soto speak. Although it often refers to reduced rates of behavior that putone at risk, comments from Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson (Harris,2001), who suggested that overly permissive societal norms are the rootcause of the terrorist attack, also illustrate this perspective.Religious support maintains the sense of significance by helpingpeople feel as though they are not alone in their struggle or stress. Godmay be viewed as a helping partner, and a group of like-minded peoplemay lend a sense that they are receiving help during a time of need.Many people's comments, such as \"God is with us,\" reflect this form ofreligious coping.Ritual purification offers a way for people to address personalfailures and inadequacies. By participating in purification rites such asconfession or repentance individuals can reconcile their ideal, their senseof significance, with the reality that they don't always measure up tothose ideals. The countless prayer services and candle-light vigils thathave been performed, and the millions of people who have participated inthem, demonstrate the importance of ritual purification as a copingmethod to people distressed by the terrorist acts.Religiousreframingenablestheindividualtoreinterpret(or\"reframe\") things so that the sense of meaning and significance ismaintained. This occurs, for example, if the negative events take on anew meaning, and perhaps even become an opportunity to grow. Many ofthe messages heard from political leaders, such as the idea that terroristsand bombs can not destroy freedom, fit into this category. They reaffirmcore values and identities, and in so doing maintain individuals' views ofthemselves and what they consider to be important.Transformational coping strategies are more difficult to deal withbecause they require more change. If for some reason individuals cannotmaintain their sense of significance, if the things that they value actuallylose value, then people will opt for transformational coping. An exampleof thisis a conversion or apostasy experience. Suppose that, afterlearning of the attacks and the tremendous loss of life, a person lost faithin God and humanity, forsaking them for a new belief system. Thiswould be a transformational coping strategy. Changing one's beliefsystem is a major undertaking, and typically comes only reluctantly, after 382NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY conservational coping strategies have been tried and failed. Recent mediareports have not yet reflected this type of coping but because people firstattempt conservational strategies, we may expect such accounts in thefuture.Religion provides a powerful way to cope with stress. Pargament's(1997) research shows that religion adds additional resources to the othercoping resources that a person has available. Even if one has a close-knit family, the feeling that one is part of a religious group helps theindividual to weather difficult times. Also, because religion is abstractand symbolic, one can reinterpret events so that they make sense withinthe core belief system. It lends itself to reframing.The FutureWhere do we go from here? Clearly, typical citizens are not em-powered with the ability to strike back at the terrorists, whoever they are.Nevertheless, there are some things that people may do to benefitthemselves and their communities.Individuals can reach out to those in need. Many reasonable personsfeel that we have a moral obligation to offer help to those who sufferedpersonally in the attacks. There also are many legitimate relief agenciesthat can use your time or monetary contribution. Several are listed athttp: / /www.psyww.com/psyrelig /refugee.htm.Talk about the attacks, about their implications for daily life. Therewill be debates about the nature of freedom and democracy, and whatfreedoms people might be willing to forego for the hope of greater safety.Think about these important issues and discuss them with other people.In all likelihood these debates are going to become increasingly im-portant in the future.Individuals can be involved in the political process where they live bywriting to their elected officials, urging them to use care in responding tothese heinous acts. For example, some commentators in the US and in theworld remind us that much of the world sees the US as being hypocriticalfor preaching the virtue of democracy, at the same time that it refuses toencourage elections in countries led by what amounts to dictatorships.Do people in the US believe deeply in democracy, or do short-termexpediencies win out? These are questions that American citizens shouldbe debating. Discuss these issues, and write to your elected officials,urging them to do the same. Ask what the US can do to help its actionsmatch its lofty ideals.Finally, people can learn about Islam and share that knowledge withother persons. One very good source of information about Islam ishttp://www.religioustolerance.org. Treat Muslims well, and refuse totolerate or condone acts of abuse. During World War II, the US held NielsenTERRORISTIC ATTACK 383 captive many of its citizens simply because of their race. The US, as asociety, has learned something during the 60 years since that war. Let usshow each other and the world that we reject prejudice and hate.William James (1902/1985) suggests that we can judge religion by itseffects. If religion helps people deal with tragedy, then that is good, butwe also must recognize that religious ideology played a role in initiatingthe tragedy. Like many things, religion is complex and multifaceted, withmany different effects. Religion's complexity challenges psychologists tounderstand its nuances and to communicate that knowledge to our fellowhuman beings. The attack of September 11, 2001, reminds us of theimportance of this task.REFERENCESHarris, J. F. (2001, Sept. 14). God gave U.S. 'what we deserve,' Falwell says.Washington Post, Page C3.James, W.

Effects of Indoor Foliage Plantson Subjects' Recovery from Mental FatigueSeiji ShibataBunkyo Women's University, Saitama, JapanNaoto SuzukiDoshisha University, Kyoto, JapanWe investigated the effects of foliage plants on participants' taskperformance, fatigue, and mood. Two room conditions (one in whichplants were arranged in the room and the other without plants) werecreated. Undergraduate students (M=33, F=37) performed 2 sessions of akey response task under one of the two room conditions. As for taskperformance, Plant x Session interaction was significant (p< .05). Thetask scores in the first session did not show any significant differencebetween plant and no plant conditions. Although it was not significant,the scores in the second session showed higher scores under the plantcondition than in the no-plant condition. The plant condition and the no-plant condition did not show any differential effects on the deteriorationof task scores in each session. Though the plants affected task scores,they did not show any effects on subjects' moods or fatigue. It wasconcluded that the presence of the plant might have influenced recoveryfrom mental fatigue.Itis generally believed that looking at \"nature\" has a positiveinfluence on recovery from fatigue, or stress. For many years this beliefwas unaccompanied by scientific proof. However, in recent years, thestudy of possiblerelations between the human and the naturalenvironment gained popularity, and many researchers have providedscientific data in support of this belief.Ulrich (1984) reported that patients who could see nature throughwindows recovered faster than those who could see only a brick building.Hartig, Mang, & Evans (1991) suggested positive benefits on mentalfatigue from just a brief exposure to the natural environment. Moreover,Hartig, et al. (1996) showed that people evaluated their mood morepositively when they saw slides of natural scenes than those of urbansettings. This suggests that the effects of nature can also be conveyedthrough slides.

The first was offered by Kaplan (Kaplan, S., 1995;Kaplan, S. & Kaplan, R. 1989), who theorized that the scenes of natureawakens one's fascination with it: clouds, sunsets, snow patterns, themotion of the leaves in the breeze these readily capture one'sattention, but in an undramatic fashion. The presence of natural beautyenables one to rest.The second (Ulrich, 1981, 1984; Ulrich et al., 1991) maintains thatrecovery from fatigue through the natural environment s one of severalpatternsof spontaneousemotionalresponseselicitedbyvisualinformation such as moderate depth, moderate complexity, the presenceof a focal point, and the presence of contents such as vegetation or water.Perception of these properties prompts a shift toward more positiveemotional states and blocks negative emotions and thoughts.People can be exposed to natural elements such as trees and plants invarious ways, not only in the forest or the wilderness, but also indoors.Kaplan (1993) investigated the role of nature in the workplaceenvironment. She found that when people could see trees through thewindow, it was beneficial for them even where many of those trees weresmall, but that no psychological benefit was found when people could seeonly buildings through the window, even when natural lighting camethrough the window. In indoor settings, the window provides the maincontact with nature. However, when the scenery from the window is notenough, people try to compensate for it. For example, they might do thisby decorating the room with posters of natural scenes (Heerwagen &Orians, 1986). In recent years, it has become popular to add foliageplants to improve the amenity of the indoor environment. This can alsobe a reflection of people's needs of natural elements as Heerwagen &Orians (1986) suggested.In the workplace, it has become common to arrange plants in thehope that the arrangement would reduce the amount of such symptoms aseye-strain, shoulder stiffness, back pain and brain fatigue, or that it wouldhelp one recover from these symptoms. Kondo & Toriyama (1989) foundthat seeing plants would help subjects recover from the visual fatiguecaused by the constant use of a visual display terminal (VDT). Moreover,Asaumi, Nishina, Nakamura Masui, and Hashimoto (1995) found thatseeing plants during the VDT task helped reduce visual fatigue, andseeing plants after the task helped the participants recover from visualfatigue. These studies used critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) as anindex of fatigue and the main focus of the study was on visual fatigue.Therefore, there was no way to show how the performance of the VDTtask had changed due to the presence or absence of plants. Shibata & SuzukiINDOOR PLANT387 The relatior ship between task performance and the Jensity of plantsin the work setting was studied by Larsen, Adams, Deal, Kweon, andTyler (1998). They found that as plant density increased task per-formance grew worse, but the mood of the workers grew better.Superficially, their results contradicted expectations, but their resultscould have been influenced by the type of task. The task they used was asimple repetitive task to identify the letters in a document. Stone & Irvine(1993, 1994) investigated the effects of having access to a window ontask performance, and found that the influence of windows on one'sperformance depends on the nature of the task. They found thatperformance on simple repetitive tasks such as filing or computing wasmade worse by the view from the window, while the windowedenvironment enhanced performance on creative tasks. [t was also pos-sible that the existence of plants distracted participants' attention from thetask in Larsen et al.'s (1998) study.In the everyday work setting, it is common to take a short rest duringwork. There was no break in the Larsen et al. study. Therefore, it is notknown how plants affected the recovery of task performance after thebreak. Since VDT tasks in the office require gazing at the display, theexistence of the plants may distract one from doing the task. However,we expected that the presence of the plants would have greater influenceon the workers during break time because they would pay more attentionto their surroundings then. That is, we predicted that the presence of theplant would have a greater effect on recovering from fatigue than on taskperformance. In the current study, therefore, we used a key-typing taskwith a VDT, and placed an interval between the repeated tasks toinvestigate the effects of the plants on the participants' fatigue andrecovery from faigue.METHODParticipantsSeventy undergraduate students (male 33, female 37), who vol-unteered by signing a roster, participated in this study. The studentsreceived extra credit for their participation.Task EnvironmentThe room used in this study was 210cm x 360cm, and had one doorand no window. A 180cm x 180cm screen was placed 150cm away fromthe door to divide the room into two parts. The control devices werearranged on the door side, and the rest of the room was used for aworking room. In the work place, there were two shelves of 91cm(W) x62cm(H) x 28.5cm(D) each, a desk, and a chair. One of the shelves wasplaced at the corner most distant from the door (northwestern corner),3g61 ) r 388NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY facing south. The other shelf was placed at the corner of the opposite side(northeastern corner), facing west. The desk was 100cm(W) x 64.5cm(H)x 69cm(D), and was placed against the east wall on the longer side of thedesk and 100cm away from the north wall. A 17-inch computer displayand a keypad were placed on the desk, and two speakers were on bothsides of the display. There were two conditions, one with the plantsarranged in the room, and the other in which there were no plants. Thenumber of plants was not too dense to distract the subjects' attention indoing their task but dense enough for identifying the influences of thepresence of the plants. Potted plants used in this study were of threedifferent kinds. They were heart leaf philodendron (Philodendron scan-dens oxycardium), augusta (Strelitzia-augusta), and walking stick palm(Phycorapis The plants ranged in height from about15cm to 30cm. The augusta and the philodendron were arranged on theshelf in the northwestern corner, and the stick palm on the shelf in thenortheastern corner. These plants were arranged so as not to be in theparticipants' sight while doing their task.TaskA key response task was used in this study. Three green lights wereshown on the middle of the monitor, and each light was given a number, 1 to 3, below each light. The left light was given the number 1, themiddle one was given a number 2, and the right one was given thenumber 3. The size of each light was 2cm in diameter. The lights wereplaced on the position that the top of the each light was 6.5cm from thetop of the monitor, and the interval between each light was 2.5cm. Thecenter of the middle light was centered horizontally. One of the threelights was turned on at a time, and the task waspush the key corresponding to the number of the lighted one as quickly and asaccurately as possible. The duration of the lighting was 200msec, and theinterval between two lights was 500msec. When the light was turned on,a 400Hz sine wave was presented for 200msec from the speaker to warnsubjects that the light was turned on. The display of the stimuli and therecording of the subjects' response were all controlled by a personalcomputer in the control room.QuestionnaireFourteen items of 10cm analogue scale was created to assess thesubjects' mood and fatigue. The items items of 7-point SD scales were created toassess the evaluation of the room. The items used were \"relaxing - Shibata - artificial.\"ProcedureParticipants were assigned randomly to the plant or the no-plantcondition. The number of participants in the plant coma:lion was 35 (16male and 19 female), and the number in the no-plant condition was 35(17 male and 18 female).The experiment consisted of two task sessions, each of which lasted5 minutes with a 3-minute break between tasks. After participants enteredthe room, they were asked to take a seat and were given task instructionsfollowed by a one-minute practice session with their task. After that, theywere asked to place a short vertical line along each of the 14 lines toindicate how they currently felt about their mood and fatigue. When theparticipants completed the questionnaire, they engaged in the keyresponse task for five minutes. Five minutes later, the subjects wereasked to complete the mood and fatigue questionnaire again. They had a3-minute break, and were asked to rest and instructed not to stand upwhile they rested. The experimenter was out of the room during the rest.When the time was over, the experimenter returned and the participantswere again asked to complete the mood and fatigue questionnaire.Following this, they engaged in the key response task for another fiveminutes. Again, participants were asked to complete the mood andfatigue questionnaire, and then asked to evaluate the room used in theexperiment.RESULTSTask performancesTask scores were calculated as follows: we started with correctresponse rates during the first two minutes (session 1) and those from thelast two minutes (session 2) of the first task, those of the first twominutes (session 3) and those from the last two minutes (session 4) of thesecond task, and all of these were then subjected to the inverse sinetransformation. Data from participants whose task scores were more thanthree standard deviations below the mean were excluded from dataanalysis, leaving data from 68 participants in the final data set.Using a 2 (plant) x 4(sessions) x 2(gender) analysis of variance, wefound the plant-by-session interaction significant (F(3,192)=2.98, p<.05)and main effect significant (F 3,192 = 47.93, p <.01). Further398 390NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY TABLE 1 Factor pattern of 14 items of the questionnaire about subjects'mood and showed no plant effects in each of the session points. When thecontrasts against the first session point were examined, however, therewere significant effects in session 3 and session 4 (F1, 64=7.04, p<.01; F1,64=5.54, p<.05, respectively). As illustrated in Figure 1, differencescores of the second task (session 3 and session 4) were higher in theplant condition than in the no-plant condition. TABLE 2Transition of the Factor Scores of Each 123TimeFIGURE 1 Transition of the Task Score with the Score at Time 1 as theBaseline.4 Mood and fatigue questionnaireScore on the mood and fatigue questionnaire was defined as the length from the left end of the line to the marker placed by eachparticipant for each item. Factor analysis with a varimax rotation wascarried out with the scores thus defined on 14 mood and fatigue items.To facilitate interpretation, factor loadings greater than or equal to 0.5 areshown in Table. Three factors emerged. For Factor 1, those items withhigh loadings were \"vigorous\", \"active\", \"clear - minder. suggest the \"energy factor\" as a possiblename. For Factor 2, the high loadings were on \"fatigued'', \"eye-strained\",\"sodden\", \"sleepy\", and \"distracted\", which could be called the \"fatiguefactor\". For Factor 3, the high loadings were on \"relaxed,\" \"tense,\" and\"at ease,\" which could be named the \"relax factor.\" Table 2 shows mean factor scores at each point of time Each set of factor scores wassubjected to the 2(plant) x 2(gender) x 4(session) analysis of variance.The main effect of session was significant in all three factors (F 3,192 =5.80, p<.01 for the energy the fatigue factor; F3,192=49.97, p<.01 for the relax factor). However, no main effects of Plant or Gender were found. Scores on the energy factordecreased significantly during the first session of the task (F 1,64 =9.71, p<.01 for the change from session 1 to session 2), and scores of the40,0 392NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY fatigue factor increased significantly during the second portion of thetask (F1,64=15.96, p<.01 for the change from session 3 to session 4). The scores on the relax factor changed significantly between all sessionpoints, decreased and increased alternately (F 1,64 =70.53, p<.01 fromsession 1 to session 2; F from session 2 to session 3;F 1,64=43.27, p<.01 from session 3 to session 4).Room EvaluationThe room evaluation scores showed a significant main effect of thepresence of the plant (F 10,56 =2.29, p<.05) in the Plant x Gendermultivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The mean evaluation item scores were shown in Figure 2. The stepwise discriminant analysisshowed that the main effect of plant presence was significant on theevaluation scores of \"noisy- silent\" and =4.89,p<.05; F 1,56=4.51 p <.05, respectively). That is, the room with the plantswas evaluated as quieter and smaller compared to the room without theplants. 1234567relaxing!IIII1restlesscomfortableIIII!uncomfortablenoisy!IIIIsilentspaciousi!1IIsmallconcentratingiIII1Idistractingsuitable for a II!diversenatural !artificial12345670-- PLANTNO PLANT FIGURE 2 Profiles of the Evaluation of the Room in Each Condition40 Shibata & SuzukiINDOOR PLANT393 DISCUSSIONIn this study, effects of the presence of the plant were seen on the evaluation of the room and task performances. However, there was no significant effect of the plants on the mood or fatigue evaluation. In the mood and fatigue evaluation, the score on the energy factor decreasedfirst, and then the score on the fatigue factor increased. This seems to suggest that the fatigue might have accumulated gradually over theperiod of the experiment. The room was evaluated as being smaller under the plant condition than in the no-plant condition. Perhaps visualinformation was perceived as denser in the plant condition than the no-plant condition, leading to the perception of the room as smaller in theformer than in the latter. Also, the evaluation of the room being more\"silent\" in the plant condition than in the no-plant condition suggests that attention to the surrounding noise decreased because the subjects'attention was drawn to the plants in the room.Task performance effects of the plants were observed in the plantcondition in the second task. The fact that the scores on the second taskwere higher in the plant condition than in the no-plant condition appearsto suggest that the recovery from fatigue could have been accelerated bythe plants. We should also note that the plants did not affect scores on thefirst task or the second task. This seems to suggest that the existence ofthe plants affected the restoration from fatigue rather than the reductionof fatigue from the VDT task. Kaplan (Kaplan, S., 1995; Kaplan, S. &Kaplan, R. 1989) suggested that the unintentional shift of attention isuseful for the restoration from fatigue, and natural beauty attractspeople's attention unintentionally. The potted plants in the room mighthave awakened pleasant feelings in participants and might have helpedreduce their mental fatigue as Kaplan says in his attention restorationtheory. In the current study, plants were arranged so as not to interferewith task performance. Thus it is possible that the plants could havehelped suppress fatigue. However, as the results of Larsen et al. (1998) and Stone & Irvine (1993, 1994) suggest, exposure to the informationirrelevant to the task is likely to distract participants' attention to the task,and hinder their task performance rather than reduce their fatigue.Ulrich (Ulrich, 1981, 1984; Ulrich et al., 1991) suggested thatrecovery from fatigue is one of the emotional and aesthetic responsepatterns to nature, and that recovery happens because the positive moodinduced by nature reduces the stress. However, the current study showedrestorative effects by plants on task performance, without showing anyeffects on mood evaluation. The results of Tennessen and Cimprich's (1995) study showed that the restoration of directed attention was notaffected by mood, and Kaplan pointed out that the restoration of directedattention is different in this respect from stress reduction, the goal of402 394NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY which is to improve mood. Taking these studies into consideration, itseems proper to interpret our results to mean that the restoration fromfatigue was due to restoration of attention, not stress reduction.This study investigated the effects of the presence of plants onparticipants' mood and task performance in the work setting. Resultsshowed that plants had a restorative effect on fatiguein taskperformance, but that there were no effects of plants on mood and fatigueevaluation. Although this is speculative, it appears as though participants'attention was restored by the existence of plants, considering that thetask used in this study was very demanding. It is possible that even a fewplants in the work setting may help subjects in recovering from fatiguecaused by a VDT task. REFERENCESAsaumi, H., Nishina, H., Nakamura, H., Masui, Y., & Hashimoto, Y.

Rosenberg (1989) evaluated the component of self-esteem foradolescents and concluded that contextual factors play a significant rolein the management and development of self-esteem. Branscombe et al.(1999), using Rosenberg's scale items, found a ingroup attribution towards an outgroup and ingroupself-esteem.

The samplingframe resulted in 31 elementary, 8 secondary (middle), and 8 highschools inclusion in this study.All students completed the questionnaires in-class and follow-upquestionnaires were administered to absentee students. The question-naires were available in English and Spanish language versions. Thequestionnaire required approximately fifty minutes to complete.Questionnaire items regarding frequency of drug use were adaptedfrom other national druguse surveys. The drug use project Monitoringthe Future provided many items included in this study (Bachman,408 ATTRIBUTION AND ADOLESCENT Bogumil399 Johnston, & O'Malley, 1991; Johnston, O'Malley, & Bachman, 1993).The coding method used in the instrumentation recorded frequency ofdrug use study (Bachman et al.,1991; Johnston etal.,1993). Aparticipant was classified as a drug user when usage occurred during a sixmonth period prior to the students' response. The non-user groupethnicity: 32.8% White, 29.9% Black, and 32.9% Latino. The 32.6% White, 23.9% Black, and 38.6% Latino. Gendercomposition for 46%male (additional demographics--see Bogumil, 1999).Conceptual presented is a three-factor model of attributionand security. I will call this modeled process the Covalent SecurityAttribution (CSA) model. This conceptual model emerges from the nexusof Weiner's (1986) attribution theoretical framework as well as the effortof other scholars (see Bogumil, 2001).This examination of the Covalent Security Attribution model proposesan evaluation of some of the pivotal dimensions of Weiner's modelcoupled with the related work of Rotter (1966), Heider (1958), and Heiss(1981) used to develop the structure of the CSA model.This study presents an evaluation of Covalent Security Attributionmodel limited to the study of perceptions of groups. The study of groupperception in a cross cultural and reciprocal environment is a distincttheoretical venture and empirical choice of a \"proving ground\" (Hui &Triandis, 1985). This study's context or empirical \"proving ground\"permits an examination of the interaction effects of two groups coexistingin the same environment and/or context. Furthermore, each group definesand reifies the other group's perception of security.The Covalent Security Attribution Model offers a cognitive \"deepstructure\" model based social roles (Heiss, 1981) that is well suited to thetenets of structural equation modeling. Hofer, Horn, and Eber (1997, p.249) assert the more parsimonious structure of a model (one with lessparameters) provides for more viable and critical test of theoreticalproposition (Bent ler & Mooijaart, 1989). Moreover, the CSA modelpresents an empirical test of the identification of the external and internalstates that affect the perceptions of the two groups.User and non-users groups that occupy the same environment andfunction within a shared social context of security. Hayduk (1996, p. 3)contends that \"only one identifiable position from the literature\" shouldbe tested in a structural modela structural model devoid of the burdenof \"complex composites of competing conceptual views.\" Non users andusers of illegal drugs perceive their shared environment based on their407 400NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY perceptions of the other. Their perceptions of their shared environment are products of both their external and internal attributions. Theseattribution states manifest different perceptions of security of their sharedenvironment.This CSA model posits thatonlyattributionstates determine the perception of security.MeasuresThe indicator manifest variables areallLikert scaled variables.Rosenberg (1989) evaluated the component of self-esteem for adolescents(Bachman et al., 1991; Johnston et al., 1993; Lewis, Volk, Edwards, &Schulenberg, 1996). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale items parallel the indicators of the Internal Stable Uncontrollable latent variable. The indicator variables for the latent variable Internal Stable Uncontrollable (ISU) are: ICR, \"I feel I cannot do anything right;\" ING, \"Sometimes I think I am no good at all;\" and ILU, \"I feel that my life is useful.\"The indicatorvariablesforthe latentvariable External StableUncontrollable are: seen in myneighborhood;\" MPND, \"Many people in my neighborhood use illegaldrugs;\" and TLCN, \"There is a lot of crime in my neighborhood.\"A group's shared value of the utility of continuity of life events ismeasured by the their attitudes and global judgments regarding the safetyand quality of their neighborhood. The indicator variables for the latentvariable SAFE are: NGPL, \"Neighborhood is a good place to live\" andIFSN, \"I feel safe in my neighborhood.\"User and non-user groups were formed by evaluating student reports of illegal drug usage. Illegal drug use includes the use of inhalants,marijuana, heroin, cocaine, crack, and methamphetamine. The coding method used in this study's instrumentation recorded the frequency of drug use (Bachman et al., 1991; Johnston et al., 1993; Lewis, Volk,Edwards, & Schulenberg, 1996). Drug use was coded as positive whenusage occurred during six months prior to the students' response. A di-chotomous variable of drug usage was established to identify the user andnon-user groups. The user group (n=256) was comprised of students whohad reported the use of illegal drugs during the past six months. The non-user group (n=765) was comprised of students who reported no use ofillegal drugs during the past six monthsMeasurement ModelThe measurement model posits a factorial invariant model for bothuser and non-users. The conceptual model asserts structural differencesbetween user and non-users. The exogenous latent variables of Internal403 ATTRIBUTION AND ADOLESCENT Bogumil401 Stable and Uncontrollable (ISU), External Stable and Uncontrollable(ISU), and the dependent latent variable SAFE were evaluated by aconfirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 4.0 (Arbuckle, 1994-1999;Keith et al., 1995; Keith, 1997; Mac Callum, 1995). The assessment of themeasurement model was accomplished by conducting a confirmatoryfactor analysis of the three-factor model. Meredith (1993), among others,concluded the establishment of factorial invariance using two or moregroups from a population selected without representative sampling doesnot reduce the rank of the matrix providing selection of the two groupswas not based on the dependent variable (Hofer et al., 1997, p. 250).Factorial invariance may be evaluated at several levels (Meredith,1993; Cheung & Rensvold, 1999; Rensvold & Cheung, 1998; Hui &Triandis, 1985). The various levels of invariance are progressively morerestrictive in the constraints placed upon the model under evaluation. Theincremental steps in the levels of assessment of factorial invarianceinclude configural invariance (models that are identical in arrangement ofparameters with individual assessment of each group), metric invariance(factor loadings), invariance of item intercepts (item bias or differentialitem functioning), and invariance of residual (error) variances.The goal of full factorial invariance between two groups requires thatone succeeds in obtaining fit indices indicative of a good-fit of the groups(Byrne, 2001; Mulaik, James, Van Alstine, & Bennett, 1989). Anunconstrained model is compared to a baseline model with a ratcheting ofconstraints on the two-group (User and Non-user) model until an a priorilevel of factorial invariance is obtained. The desiderata of full factorialinvariance of measurement model for two groups has been suggested asthe optimum environment for evaluation of the structural model.However, partial invariance of covariance models has been submitted as areasonable standard for the evaluation of multiple group models (Aitken,Stein, & Bent ler,1994; Byrne, 1994; Meredith, 1993; Rensvold &Cheung, 1998, p. of user and non-user groups \"metric invariance\" isestablished by the assessment of the goodness of fit of the model to thedata with the factor loadings for both groups invariant. The manifestvariables or indicator variables Xs of the construct or latent variable 4must employ the same metric across groups as a basis for evaluation ofcausal relationships among the constructs or latent variables s. Theevaluation of factorial invariance of the two-group model of CovalentSecurity Attribution will examine the following hypotheses. 1)Thetwo-groupmeasurementmodeldemonstratesconfiguralinvariance.2) The two-group measurement model demonstrates metric invariance.409 402NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The conceptual model of the structural relationship among the latentvariables for each model supported the hypothesized differences instructural relationships of the user and non-user groups. The CovalentSecurity Attribution structural model further examines the additional fourhypotheses.3) The user group's attribution represented by their perception of theirInternal, Stable, Uncontrollable (ISU) state will be a positive function oftheir perception of security (SAFE).4) The user group's attribution represented by their perception of theirExternal, Stable, Uncontrollable (ESU) state will be a neutral function oftheir perception of security (SAFE).5) The non-user group's attribution represented by their perception oftheir Internal, Stable, Uncontrollable (ISU) state will be a negativefunction of their perception of security (SAFE).6) The non-user group's attribution represented by their perception oftheir Internal, Stable, Uncontrollable (ESU) state will be a negativefunction of their perception of security (SAFE).RESULTSThe analysis of the proposed Covalent Security Attribution (CSA)model involved a confirmatory factor analysis of the measurement model.The confirmatory factor (i.e., the a priori hypothesized measurementmodel) analysis was performed on the total sample of students (n= 1021).The results of the confirmatory factor analysis are presented in Figure 1.The correlation matrix and standard deviations are presented in Table 1. The results of the structural model for the non-user group arepresented in Figure 2. The results of the structural model for the usergroup are presented in Figure 3. The examination of the structural modelsindicated that the four hypotheses were confirmed. The method ofestimation of the covariance matrix was maximum likelihood. Multiple fitindices are presented to capture various aspects of model viability and performance. All parameter estimates were significant. The modelidentification process requires that selected moments (manifest variables)be set to unity (Byrne, 2001). 4.10 ATTRIBUTION AND ADOLESCENT Bogumil403 Figure 1:CFA Three ePs3 neightorhood feel ING Sometimes Ithink I am ateps5all.70.49IW I feel rry life isnot very usefulePs6 otlxr wean Many people in ny reigttatrcd use Megil drugslICNItere is a la N1GFLNigttortiood is agood Ihe IFS N I feel safe infly reiglibaincd 1LUI feel ny life is rri wry useful INGSaretirres I think I amp gpcd at allICR I feel I canrrit do anything ard other weapctis often seen in rry neiftothoodNFND Many people in MI trigjtorhood use illegil drugsTLCNThere lct of IFSN I feel safe in rryneigthorhood ILUI feel nry life is not wry useful ING Sorretints I think I amno good at allIOU feel I carrot do anything righ413 406NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The confirmatory analysis suggested a good fit of the measurement model(see Figure 1).

Bollen (1989, p. 366) and Cheung andRensvold (1999, p. 2) suggest equivalence or invariance of the factorloadings must be established before proceeding to the further evaluationof a model. The factor loadings for the item responses (manifestvariables) for the same constructs (latent variables) across both groupswere evaluated for equivalence. The hypothesis of factorial invariance ofthe measurement model between the user and non-user group wasconfirmed (see Figure 1).414 ATTRIBUTION AND ADOLESCENT Bogumil407 DISCUSSIONThe groups within this study have experienced significant intergroupdynamics. Additionally, the social influence of these groups within areciprocal social environment of school and community has reified thesocial identity of each group (Deschamps, of each groups's membersincubates and manifests the group's social identity. The evaluation ofgroup identity is the composite of several levels of social characteristicssuch as: sex, age, ethnicity, and religious beliefs (Brower & Garvin,1989).The salient social characteristics that are shared among individualgroup members are, in this study, also inculcated in the attribution states(internal-external,stable-unstable, & controllable-uncontrollable) ofgroup members (see citations to Wiener and Wiener and associates inliterature review section). This study finds that the user group member'sperception of their group identity is a manifestation of the internal usergroup dynamicsthe user group's dynamics foster attribution states reify the user group's identity.Notably, the reification of user group identity is also a product of theinteraction with the non-user group. The groups are functioning withinthe interdependent larger society. Notwithstanding, there are people whouse drugs and people who do not use drugsthese groups are mutuallyexclusive and exhaustive.The compulsory environment oftheschoolandthesharedenvironment of community are not optional or mutually exclusivesettings. These settings are the forced existence of every school-agedadolescent. Adolescents cannot reasonably find sanctuary and live aseparate reality apart from the community, the school, or the other group.This study's findings suggest that drug use status is extremely significantin the process of group identification and cohesion. Furthermore, theinternal attribution states of members of either group are the critical lensthat reveal the intragroup affects of our shared drug culture.Theusergroupmember'sinternalstates,socialidentifiablecharacteristics, and drug use status reveal a portrait of group dynamicsbased in hopelessness of a social identity that was chosen through drugusage. A user group identityis sustained by the non-user group'sindifference, fear, loathing, scapegoating, and desire to preserve theirown identity as pure and without culpability for the user group'scontinued existence and behavior.415 408NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The non-user group members' internal states,social identifiablecharacteristics, and drug use status reveals a portrait of group dynamicsbased in the hope of a social identity that was chosen through abstentionfrom drug usage and sustained by the user group's volatile presence in theschool and community. The user group member's perceive the non-usergroup members with indifference, fear, and loathing. Subsequently, thenon-user group's presence preserves the user group's identity as acorrupted form of puritya corrupt purity that places one in touch withthe harsh reality of life and not some inexperienced view of hopeasexpressed by non-users.Scholars (Brower & Garvin, 1989; attributes\" (e.g., \"age, sex, cognitions, affects, or previousexperiences\") of group member can have significant effects on memberinteraction (Brower & Garvin, 1989, p. 93-94). the attributional states (internal-external, stable-unstable, &controllable-uncontrollable) of group members may require a design thatpermits the control for these \"relevant individual attributes\" and \"group (Brower & Garvin, 1989, p. 93-94). Thereby, the attri-butionalstates of group members may be examined without theexpectations of undue influence from these other variables.This study's sample reveals that numerous social demographicvariables provide a basis of nearly equally matched characteristics or\"relevant individual attributes\" between both \"natural\" groups and within\"natural\" groups (Brower & Garvin, 1989). An examination of sex, age,ethnicity (Black, Latino, & White), co-residence of both mother andfather, educational objectives, achievement effort, cognitive activities,physical activities, and participation in family responsibilities, indicatesan equal distribution within both user and non-user groups and betweenuser and non-user groups. Therefore, the analysis of the attributionalstates as presented in this study embody the exposition of the intragroupspecific interactions.The perception of external stable and uncontrollable attributions ofthe non-user group indicates a strong and negative effect on the non-usergroup's perceptions of security (see Figure 2). However, the internal,stable and uncontrollable perception of non-user attributions of selfindicate a neutral effect on the non-user group's perception of security.This result alone would suggest the non-user group's state of helplessnessin their perception of environmental security. Furthermore, the non-user'sperception of the external factors affecting their perception of security arestrongly negative. However, the context of this shared environment withusers of illegal drugs suggests that the social influence (i.e., threat) of a416 ATTRIBUTION AND ADOLESCENT Bogumil409 smaller group of users exceeds the social influence of the larger non-usergroup.The perception of external stable and uncontrollable attributions ofthe user group indicates a strong and negative effect on the user group'sperceptions of security (see Figure 3). The perception of a lack ofsecurity by the user group coupled with the user group's activities thatboth implicitly and explicitly contribute to their group's perception ofinsecurity is ironic. The user group's perception of security is moderatelystrong compared to that of the non-user group. This difference betweenthe non-user and user group's perception of security represents the usergroup's increased knowledge and awareness of the activitiesthatcontribute to less security in the environment and the user group'spotential to avoid, evade, and manage such a threat to their security.Nonetheless, the non-user group's perception of lack of security withintheir shared environment seems authenticated by the user group'sperception and direct awareness of external factors.The user group's perception of self is most disturbing. This group'sperception of self has a moderate and negative effect on their perceptionof security. Moreover, the user group demonstrates that the higher theirgroups' self esteem the greater potential for a lack of security. Thebrinkmanship of conflict and the high potential for a spiral of negativereciprocity of action mainifests a perception that affects the user group'ssecurity. The user group perceives user group self esteem as a potentialthreat to the security of their environment, whereas the non-users perceivetheir self esteem as unimportant to their security.There are additional intragroup dynamics that manifest perceptions ofconsensus and cohesion within each group. The non-user group'svariations in their collective perception of esteem, control, and securityare artifacts of intragroup dynamics processes of consensus and cohesion.The matched social and demographic characteristics of each group, withthe requisite exception of substance use status, presents a refined,pragmatic, and utilitarian narrowing of the scope conditions pertinent tothe evaluation of the intragroup dynamicsintragroup attribution states.Furthermore, the central proposition of this study, the Covalent SecurityAttribution (CSA) model, is illuminated by revealing the fundamentalconnections between the intragroup attribution states, the intragroupelements of consensus dimensions: esteem,control, and security.The non-user groups' intragroup perception of esteem is based in theirshared behavior of abstention from drug use. Moreover, their capacity toresist the culture of drug use present in their community and schoolsauthenticates their capacity to control their behavior. The non-user .410NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY group's consensus actions create a sense of cohesion that results in anintragroup perception of security. However, this group does not exist inisolation for the user group. Therefore, the non-user group's perceptionsand attributions are tempered by their constant interactions with the usergroup.The user group's intragroup perception of esteem is based in theirshared behavior of drug use. Their capacity to resist the social and legalsanctions and prohibition present in their community and schoolsauthenticates their capacity to control their behavior. The user group'sconsensus actions create a sense of cohesion that results in an intragroupperception of securitythe delusional perception of the intragroupinvulnerability of deviance. Again, this group does not exist in isolationfrom the non-user group. Therefore, the user group's perceptions andattributions are tempered by their constant interactions with the non-usergroup.The internal dynamics of the group by definition will always beidentified by the characteristics of behavior or demographics that set thegroup apart and manifest its social identity as a group. Clearly, non-usersand users are the only two categories of individuals available for groupmembership within our drug culture. They are exclusive groups.Therefore,their drug usestatus and perpetuation of pathologicalattribution states within the drug culture of school and community fostersan interdependent and reciprocal status as an artifact of their intragroupand intergroup dynamics. This negative reciprocity and cycle of thedegeneration of humanity may be symptomatic of the remains of a\"society [that] has reinforced the more narcissistic and pleasure seekingaspects of human striving rather than the more altruistic and sociallyuseful\" (Garvin, 1984, p. 18).Lastly, the Covalent Security Attribution model has significant valueto the literature in group behavior (Aitken et al., 1994; Bavelas, Hastorf,Gross, & & McAndrews, 1986), and communities with substance abusepopulations (Bachman et al., 1991; Donohew et al., 1999; Johnston et al.,1993; Miller & 1996; Oetting, 1999; Edwards, Lewis, &Schulenburg, 1996).

Conjunctive Forms and Conditional Inference inQuestions and E. PratarelliUniversity of Southern Colorado Adam LawsonFlorida Southern CollegeUtterances that use conjunctives such as and, or, and either-or increasecognitive workload because they require more complex processing thansimpler ones. To test this notion, two experiments were carried out toexamine the effects these conjunctions have on the process of derivinginferences used to judge congruency. In Experiment 1 participants read 3-4 sentence long vignettes to establish a context after which a testsentence, using one of the above conjunctions, was rapidly judged to be amatch or nonmatch. Mean reaction times (RT) and accuracy (RA) wereanalyzed. Experiment 2 essentially replicated the first with the exceptionthat the test phrases were constructed as interrogatives. Results from bothexperiments were consistent with each other and demonstrated that andwas least ambiguous, followed closely by either-or. However, the oroperator produced significant delays in response time as well as reducingaccuracy by as much as 90 percent in one condition. Results areinterpreted in view of applied concerns where investigations rely onasking complex questions to determine facts.In language, conjunctions serve the purpose of conveying linkagebetween two or more conceptual entities or propositions. Cognitively, thereader/listener is forced to evaluate one concept, conjoin it with anotherin some specified form, and then comprehend the sum or product. Theuse of conjunctions like the words and, or, either-or, etc., are used toconvey conditional properties of a sentence or question for which thereader/listener must consider alternative interpretations. For example,Springston and Clark (1973) examined the comprehension times for shortpseudoimperative clauses and sentences and concluded that the use of orcould be conceptually reduced to and plus a negative, i.e., \"not (p and q)\" (p.269). These sorts of mental operations are critical in certain appliedsettings, in particular, when interrogations are performed. Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Marc Pratarelli, Psych. Dept.,University of Southern Colorado, 2200;Bonforte Blvd., Pueblo, CO 81001.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 3, 415-428.NAJP423 416NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY In the sentence \"Be quiet or I'll shoot you\" the reader/listener derivesthe conditional outcome of being shot only if the individual fails to stoptalking. Using Springston and Clark's logic, being shot and being quietdo not occur together provided the pseudoimperative instruction con-veyed by or is met. A similar case can be made when using questions asin the example: \"Did you sabotage that laboratory or kill the people init?;\" again, not (p and q). If a suspect who allegedly committed thesabotage of the laboratory, but never intended to kill anyone inside, isasked such a question, the interpretation of the conditional property ofthe conjunction or is semantically equivalent to: \"I did not sabotage thelaboratory and kill the people in it.\" If p equals sabotage, and q equalsmurder, then the above question meets the properties of not (p and q).Assuming the truth is, in fact, that the suspect committed the sabotageresulting in the killing of several innocent people, the improper choice ofconjunctive allows the suspect to logically conclude that the question orstatement, although true, is incongruent with the original intentions whenthe crime was committed. Thus, asking such questions introduces ameasure of ambiguity that may allow an individual to escape theassignment of guilt.It would similarly introduce noise into any in-vestigation or interrogation to detect their deception and concealedknowledge.The focus of the present study is to examine the degree of ambiguityin the interpretation of complex statements and questions that useconditionals and conjunctions like those illustrated above. Ambiguity inconditional sentences or questions can be evaluated in many differentways (cf., Chase & Clark, 1972; Clark using the conditional for-mat of if-then statements (p.561). The notion of an invited inference isbased on falsely deduced interpretations of sentences they constructedusing the if-then operators. In their example: \"If you take out thegarbage, I'll give you a dollar\", one reasonable interpretation is thecomparatively similar sentence using negations: \"If you don't take outthe garbage, I won't give you a dollar.\" Geis and Zwicky pointed out thatthe latter invited inference is invalid because the original does not implyit necessarily. In the original example the person could fail to take out thegarbage (i.e., failing to meet the first condition), but still receive thedollar, and this is an equally reasonable inference to make. One can arguethat the ambiguity is itself dependent on both the context of the situationand the sentence construction.In the present study the conjunctives and, or, and either-or weremanipulated in order to assess comprehension and ambiguity. The4g4 Pratarelli & LawsonCONJUNCTIVE FORMS 417 rationale for using both questions and statements was based on theapplication of these results to the construction of conditional questions byinterrogators, security, and law enforcement examiners. A major concernin any applied area that uses investigative procedures dependent onasking carefully constructed questions is whether the examinee com-prehends the exact or intended meaning of the investigator. The unusualcircumstances surrounding investigations of fact and the determination ofguilt or innocence are such that individuals with incomplete knowledgeof events must use an open and unrestricted context to make inferences incomplex questions. Conversely, individuals with a complete knowledgedatabase, e.g., the guilty suspect in the sabotage scenario discussedearlier, use a narrow or restricted context because their knowledge isspecific. Ray and Findley's (1984) argument suggests that the latterwould be more likely to make invalid inferences. Moreover, because aguilty individual seeking to avoid detection understands the intent andconsequences of conditional questions or statements, they are most likelyto intentionally make invalid inferences as a means of escaping detectionby remaining technically truthful.The working logic for the present experiments is that conjunctivesused to convey conditional properties of questions and statements willvary systematically in their ability to produce invalid inferences. Theinvalidinferencesshouldbereflectedinsimplemeasureslikecomprehension time and accuracy. The conjunction, and, should be theleast ambiguous because it expresses the simplest (positive) case ofadditivity of concepts, e.g., given a prior context, p and q is a validconditionalwhen both componentsarecongruentwiththepre-established context. The conjunction or should produce the most am-biguity because it does not specify whether the positive or negativecondition should apply, e.g., not (p and q). Lastly, the conjunctive seteither-or should remove any need for making alternative inferencesbecause it makes explicit the conditions that must be met to evaluate thequestion or statement, e.g., either p or q, but not both.EXPERIMENT 1The purpose of Experiment 1 was to compare and contrast the effectsof using the and and the or conjunctive operations in declarativesentences. In contrast to some previous research (cf., Ray & Findley,1984; Richardson & Ormerod,1997; Springston & Clark, 1973) that usedcomparative performance tasks to examine processing differencesbetween independent conditionals, we chose to use comprehension speedand accuracy because each conditional could be evaluated withoutdependency on the evaluation or comparison of another conditional. ThusExperiment 1 tested the specific hypotheses that (1) different conjunctive 418NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY forms will affect comprehension time consistent with the relative degreeof ambiguity that each manifests during conditional reasoning, and (2)different conjunctive forms will affect the accuracy of correct forced-choice decisions resulting from the process of conditional reasoning.MethodParticipants. Twenty two college undergraduates participated duringdevelopment and norming of the stimuli. Afterward, 40 test participants(Mean age = 21.9 years; SD = 1.1 years) were similarly solicited.Participants were offered extra course credit for their participation. Theywere screened for handedness (in order to counterbalance match vs.nonmatch response hands), normal or corrected-to-normal vision, normalneurological history, no history of Learning Disabilities, and English astheir first and dominant language. In addition, because the test stimuliwere normed on a college student population, the test participants werescreened for no-less-than-normal comprehension skills for their collegeage using the Comprehension subtest of the 1981 version of the WechslerAdult Intelligence Scale-Revised.Materials. A total of 36 trials divided equally into six differentconditions were developed for testing along with six additional trialsused as a practice set. Each trial consisted of a short vignette composedof 3-4 short declarative sentences. The average length of the sentenceswas 8.1 words. Each vignette was paired with a declarative conditionalphrase using either the and, or, or the either-or conjunctive operators.The purpose of each vignette was to establish a context against which theconditional phrase could be tested for congruence, i.e., match ornonmatch. Each vignette depicted a simple scenario in which one ormore actors were engaged in one or two events. Appendix 1 lists six suchvignettes and a corresponding conditional sentence, one for each of thesix possible trial type conditions. Thus there were six trials using and thatwere true with respect to their vignette, i.e., (p and q). Six other trialsusing and were false, i.e., p and (not-q). Note that although the false andcondition could have been constructed using the sentence structure not-p(and q), such a condition would have inflated the reaction times becausethe violation of the conditional would have occurred at the beginning. Sixtrials using or were true, i.e., not (p and q), and six were false, i.e., (p andq). Similarly, six trials used the either-or operator in the match condition;(not-p) and q, p and (not-q), and six others were nonmatches dividedequally between p and q, and (not-p) and (not-q).Procedure. The six trial-type conditions were randomly ordered inthe 36-trial stimulus list. Participants were given six practice trials tobecome familiar with the task demands, one practice trial for each of thesix conditions, and the practice set could be repeated if necessary. During426 Pratarelli & LawsonCONJUNCTIVE FORMS 419 the test session, participants worked with the Experimenter to ensurecomprehension of each vignette prior to the presentation of the testphrase. Each trial began with the subject reading the vignette aloud whenit appeared on a computer screen. The vignette remained on the screen aslong as the subject needed to continue reviewing it, but never more than30 seconds. Afterward, the screen cleared and the Experimenter requireda verbal command from the subject before initiating presentation of thetest phrase. The test phrase, requiring a forced-choice (match vs.nonmatch) manual response on a keyboard, was presented at the center ofthe screen for five seconds during which the subject was required torespond as quickly and as accurately as possible. Computation of theMeans for each subject's data employed an individualized analysiswindow that rejected trials greater than 1.5 SD from their respectiveMean.ResultsA fully repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using a 3 x2 design (type of conjunctive x match/nonmatch response type) wasapplied separately to reaction time (RT) and response accuracy (RA)data. Greenhouse-Geisser corrected F values are reported for all analyseshaving greater than one degree of freedom. Using RT, there weresignificant main effects for both independent variables, F(2,78) = 23.1, p <.001, and F(1,39) = 9.35, p < .007, respectively. There was also asignificant conjunctive by response type interaction, F(2,78) = 6.04, p <.002. Figure la illustrates the interaction effect for which nonmatch trialswere always responded to slower than match trials. Moreover, responsesto sentences using the or conjunction operator were slower for bothmatching and nonmatching trials. Planned comparisons reflected thatindeed the only differences occurred between or and the remaining twoconjunctives (p < .05). There was no difference between and and either-or. In the or conditions, the dispersion was greater as reflected in thedoubling of the standard error.For the accuracy data,the same basic pattern emerged withsignificant main effects for both independent variables, F(2,38) = 28.45, p< .0005 and F(1,39) = 17.88, p < .004, respectively. There was also asignificant interaction effect, F(2,78) = 20.26, p < .001. Figure lb illus-trates the interaction in which match trials were responded to moreaccuratelythan nonmatchtrialsinallthreeconditions.Plannedcomparisons also revealed that the principal effects were between or andthe other two conjunctive conditions (p < .05). There was no differencebetween and and either-or response categories. An error analysis was notconducted since any trial could have been excluded because (1) it felloutside the 1.5 SD analysis window, (2) the keypress fell outside the427 420NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY 60005500500045004000350030002500200015001000U AndEither-OrOrConjunctive Form'Match'M - No MatchFigure la.

Response accuracy across all 40 participants was 76.7percent, the majority attributable to the or condition. 4 2 8 Pratarelli & LawsonCONJUNCTIVE FORMS 421 DiscussionThese resultsdemonstratethatacrossthesethreeconjunctiveoperators, the simple additive case using and is easier to comprehendthan the or case, which Geis and Zwicky (1971) and Springston andClark (1973) argued was mentally represented as not (p and g). Thecondition with either-or reestablishes the clarity in the inferences drawnfrom the statements resulting in comprehension times and accuracies thatare comparable to the and condition. Thus, p or q is represented as anegative conditional, i.e., not (p and q), for which Wright and Hull(1986) have suggested people must first conceptualize the positive andcondition followed by its negation. This can be summarized as a two-stepprocess. The present data suggest that this additional operation requires1200 to 1300 ms to achieve. In addition, because the accuracy on the ortrials was significantly poorer, the performance degrades by as much as50 percent relative to the optimum p and q case. Geis and Zwicky (1971)and Springston and Clark (1973) have both argued that the conjunctiveor activates all the biconditional versions before the correct one can beselected, and this process requires more time and draws on limitedprocessing resources.The situation for either-or is somewhat different, however, becauseits first component (either) establishes for the listener/reader that therewill be two concepts to deal with. Secondly, for the correct inference orconclusion to be drawn, at least one of those two conceptual elementsmust be true. Two factors appear to be important in the case of either-or.The first is that with regard to the issue that at least one of the twoelements must be true, participants were not affected when both elementsof the argument (p and q) were valid. Because our pilot testing showed that using p but not q, not p but q, and both p and q were notsubstantivelydifferentfromeachother,allthreewereusedinterchangeably in the match condition without appearing to draw anyadditional processing resources. Thus, either-or can be said to be themost flexible operator because it permits multiple inferences to be drawnas a function of the three possible conditionals. Given the present results,comparing the p and q condition, either p or q can be shown to beequivalent to the formula either: (p and not -q) or (not-p and q) or (p andq). This latter formula requires that any one of three possible contextualcodes, established in working memory by the vignette, needs to exist inorder to meet the conditions of either p or q.The final concern to be addressed is the apparent standard offset thatoccurs between match and nonmatch trial-type responses. Comparingacross Figures la and lb, the differential is a relatively fixed amount,about 1000 ms in the RT figure and about 1.5 trials in the RA figure.This is consistent with the notion that mismatches simply take longer to429 422NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY respond to because the evaluation time is longer. There is a comparableperformance decrement in accuracy, which suggests these participantswere not sacrificing speed for increased accuracy. Instead, both RT andRA registered comparable performance deficits attributabletotheincreaseddifficultyofconditionalreasoningwithincongruent(mismatching) information.EXPERIMENT 2The remaining issue to address is whether interrogatives affect therelationship between conditionals. It was also noted earlier that this hasimportant consequences in applied areas where interrogations and legalqueries rely on having to ask questions with multiple conceptualelements requiring the use of conjunctives. Therefore, a separate second experiment was conducted to examine differences that might beattributable to the unique case where an individual is questioned as towhich alternative is correct.MethodParticipants. A new sample of 40 undergraduate students (Mean age= 20.6 years; SD = .97 years) drawn from the same pool was solicited,screened with the same criteria, and offered extra course credit for theirparticipation.Materials and Procedures.The same 36 vignettes from Experiment1 were used with no modifications. The target sentences used for testingthe conditionals, however, were altered to form questions with minimaldistortion to the existing sentence construction, e.g.,\"Chris went jetskiingor hiking with Peter\" was changed to \"Did Chris go jetskiing or hikingwith Peter?\" Procedurally, the same protocol used in Experiment 1 wasfollowed.ResultsThe same 3 x 2 repeated-measures ANOVA design was applied tothese new data. For measures of RT, there were significant main effectsfor conjunctive type and for response type, F(2,78) = 18.7, p < .0005 andF(139) = 48.76, p < .0005, respectively. There was also a significantinteraction effect, F(2.78) = p < .002, illustrated in Figure 2a. Clearly,nonmatch trials were responded to slower than match trials for all threeconjunctives. Planned comparisons revealed that the significant pairwisedifferences occurred between or and the two remaining conditions forboth match and nonmatch trial-types, and between and and either-or only in the nonmatch condition. Using measures of RA, there were significantmain effects for both independent variables, F(2 78) = 82.42, p < .0005 andFe.78) = 60.18, p < .0005, respectively.

In contrastto the RT data, however, there were no differences between and andeither-or in either response-type condition.DiscussionThe focus of Experiment 2 was to examine the effects of differentconjunctives on match/nonmatch decisions using interrogatives. Theseresults could then be used to compare and contrast the response patternselicited by statements (Experiment 1); they will be discussed in theGeneral Discussion section below. For Experiment 2, however, theprincipal differences are clearly illustrated by Figures 2a and 2b. First,with only one exception, there is again a relatively fixed offset betweenthe match and nonmatch response-type conditions in the RT data. Thiseffect is causally attributable to the delay that results from having tomake a nonmatch decision. Consistent with much of the past research,nonmatch decisions are modeled as the process of making a matchdecision followed by a negation (Clark & Chase, 1972; Just & Carpenter,1971; Springston & Clark, 1973; Wright & Hull, 1986). Springston andClark (1973) also noted that negations need not be explicit to have adetrimental impact on processing. The case of p or q? is an example ofan implicit negation, as compared to the explicit form, not (p and q)?.The latter would be a question like \"Did you not sabotage the laboratoryand kill the people?\" By comparison, the p or q? question would appearas \"Did you sabotage the laboratory or kill the people?\" Assuming theindividual intended the sabotage, but not the killing, both questions areequivalent. The former has an explicit negation while the latter has animplicit one. In Springston and Clark's model, both samples havepractical equivalence. That is, they are semantically equivalent to: \"Ididn't sabotage the laboratory and kill the people.\"The upward trend in mean RT seen in Figure 2a reflects the difficultyof assessing the conditional properties of cases other than the basicadditive form p and q? It also reflects the comparative ease with which pand q? is processed. The accuracy data in Figure 2b provides furthersupport for this argument. As difficulty or ambiguity increases, so doesthe error rate. From the present results, one can conclude that using or ina situation that is congruent with the preexisting context would besatisfactory for the intentions of the speaker, assuming the speakerintended p or q, but not necessarily both. If the present results werepredictive of real-life situations, one could expect a significant but tol-erable delay in comprehension, with only a 20 percent risk that thelistener will make an incorrect inference. That effect increases radicallyto 90 percent, however, if one were to use p or q incongruently as in \"Didyou sabotage that laboratory or kill the people in it?\" This latter effect is3 Pratarelli & LawsonCONJUNCTIVE FORMS 425 the only notable discrepancy with the results seen in Experiment 1(compare, e.g., the or condition in Figures lb and 2b). Nevertheless,there is no practical difference between the two. Be they sentences orquestions, the incongruent use of or will impact comprehension morethan any other conjunctive.GENERAL DISCUSSIONThe results from both experiments demonstrate the significant impactof certain conjunctives on conditional reasoning. The inferences that aredrawn when using or are more likely to be false because of the increaseddifficulty of selecting the correct representation of its many possiblemeanings. The or operator indeed has considerable flexibility in its usage, but that flexibility comes with a significant cost in lack ofspecificity. In applied settings where specificity and detail are critical,questions like \"Did you sabotage that laboratory or kill the people in it?\"should never be used, and either-or (e.g., \"Did you either sabotage thatlaboratory or kill the people in it?\") should be chosen instead, providedand isnot appropriate. More importantly, \"negatives have almostinvariably been found to take longer to process than affirmatives,\" andthis delay may pose problems in situations where it is interpreted as a sign of deception rather than confusion or cautiousness (Springston &Clark, 1973, p.261).Like the previous research, the present study sought to decomposeand isolate the processing deficits of certain conjunctive forms. Theresults from both experiments are consistent with previous studiesdespite certain methodological differences needed to accommodate theapplied aspects of this research, namely, interrogation and makingqueries in legal or forensic situations. As is often the case with laboratoryresearch, natural language processing occurs in broader environmentalcontexts than the sanitized testing suite, and this impacts the validity ofthe results. Nonetheless, an appreciation for the complexity of the use(and misuse) of conjunctives in natural settings should underscore theimportance of the current laboratory results. From subject debriefings, itwas clear that the participants in the present study soon focused theirattention on the variables being manipulated. However, a routine post-hoc split halves analysis demonstrated there were no differences between the first and latter half of the stimulus set. This suggests that thecognitive-linguistic operations recruited in the process of conditionalreasoning where conjunctive forms are used, are highly automatic(Kihlstrom, 1987), and stable. There is little conscious or controlledprocessing recruited during natural language processing. Therefore, it is reasonable, if not safer, to assume that these laboratory effects generalize 426NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY to applied settings and should be taken into account when constructing adialogue or question format during an investigation or discovery of facts.Future research should seek to fractionate the processing delays andcomprehension decrements for the present conjunctives even further, aswell as other complex forms like but, unless, yet, and if, in order to testthematic or contextual variations and surface structure variations. Inaddition, the impact on comprehension of conditional reasoning withnegations should also be examined further. Given the prevalence withwhich one hears or reads obtuse surface structures such as \"Didn't youknow he wasn't there before you, or were you there first?\" more effortshould be directed at understanding qualitatively the types of com-prehension that occur.In the previous example extracted from avideotaped dialogue between two students, the listener appeared tounderstand because the focus was on the gist of the conversation. Clearly,many others variables, yet to be examined, influence the comprehensionof individual linguistic elements.REFERENCESChase, W.G., & Clark, H.H. (1972).

Monitoring Children's Behaviour in a RemoteCommunity Before and Six After theAvailability of Broadcast TVTony CharltonRonald DavieCharlie PantingMick AbrahamsCheltenham & Gloucester of Higher EducationLilla YonEducation Department, St Helena, South AtlanticTeachers rated nursery class children's behaviour 18 months before (i.e. in 1993), and 68 months after the availability of broadcast TV (i.e. in 2000) on the island of St Helena. Across a period of seven yearsand almost six years of TVfindings showed few significant differencesbetween teachers' ratings of the two cohorts. In particular, with the 2000 cohort there was no evidence of increases in the types of anti-socialbehaviours that TV is often alleged to encourage.Claims are made regularly that TV-viewing encourages anti-social behaviour (e.g. Smith, Nathanson, & Wilson, 1999). However, the evidence underpinning these allegations is frequently misconstrued or flawed. For example, strongest claims for adverse effects emanate from laboratory inquiries. Whilst these studies demonstrate the processes through which children can observe and imitate behaviours viewed on TV, the findings lack ecological validity. Studies tend to measure onlyimmediate or short-term behaviours and to exclude natural consequencesof (mis)behaviour. Support for laboratory findings is forthcoming fromsome field studies (e.g. Boyatzis, Matillo, & Nesbitt, 1995). However, these results need cautious interpretation as participants are often atypical (e.g. youngsters from institutions, and others who are initiallymore aggressive), thus calling into question the generalization of the results. Elsewhere, outcomes from naturalistic investigations are equivocal (e.g. Williams, 1986; Wiegman, Kuttschreuter, & Baarda, 1992). Moreover, whilst studies of impacton TV-na\u00efve communities have in someinstances revealed short-term behavioural effects, these have either notbeen sustained over time (Coldevin & Wilson, 1985); have varied among different community members (Granzberg, 1985); or have been inad-equately substantiated by weak TV-viewing measures (Williams, 1986).Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Tony Charlton, Cheltenham& Gloucester College of Higher Education, Box 220, Cheltenham,Gloucestershire, GL50 2QF. UKNorth American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 3, 429-440.NAJP1) 430NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Furthermore, and most importantly, naturalistic research into TV effectshas been hampered by limited opportunities to monitor behaviour beforeas well as after TV's arrival.Thus, despite claims to the contrary particularly in the USAlinks between TV viewingandviewers'behaviourremainunproven.Additionally, the equivocal nature of the TV-viewing effects' literaturesuggests that a simple, causal model for understanding TV effects isinappropriate and inadequate. A plenitude of personal and contextualcharacteristics most likely interacts with TV exposure to determine thenature and strength of any viewing effects (Wilson et al.,1998).Laboratory studies offer empirical support to this reasoning. Bandura,Ross and Ross (1961), for instance, demonstrated that children can learnanti-social behaviours from their viewing without performing them.Whether or notthislearning was performed was determined byenvironmental factors. In a similar vein, Potts, Huston and Wright (1986)found that particular environmental factors, or cues, could expunge theinfluences of exposure to TV violence (although, in terms of theperformance of, not the learning of, violent behaviours). Sawin (1990),too, highlighted the importance of situational variables as modifiers ofany TV viewing effects. Hence, differential research outcomes may wellreflect variations in context.Regrettably, few possibilities have arisen to test this model in anaturalistic setting that allows the monitoring of behaviour both prior toas well as following the availability of TV. An ideal setting within whichto help redress this paucity is a community with little or no exposure tobroadcast television (yet soon to experience TV for the first time), whichis characterized by low rates of anti-social behaviour and a social milieuwhich isvigilant over youngsters' behaviour. If the milieu remainsinfluential, then TV's availability should have minimal impact upon socialbehaviour. Fortuitously, the island of St Helena offered such a setting andthus a rare opportunity to test this model.St Helena, a UK colony in the South Atlantic Ocean, is among theworld's most isolated populated islands. It is without daily newspapers, acinema, an airport (although debates are now on-going to determine ifone is to become operational in 2003) and, until recently, broadcast TV.TV (CNN) was beamed to St Helena in March 1995. Since then thenetwork has expanded to incorporate 3 channels with the followingservices: M-Net Brochure (KTV, Movie Magic, BBC World Service),Discovery and Supersport.The introduction of broadcast television was a major event on theisland, whose only televisual experience had been through video. Thevideo arrived in1979. The island's 1987 census showed 29% of4.3\" Charlton, Davie, Panting, Abrahams, & Yon GETTING TV431 households owned one or more video sets. Whilst financial circumstancescan limit the widespread availability of the sets, so can the non-availability of electricity. At that time, many households, particularlythose in more remote and less accessible regions of the island, wereunconnected to a main electricity supply. Even so, in 1994 (the yearbefore broadcast television's availability) around 30% of 3- to 4-year-oldchildren were watching videos (mostly cartoons) for about 11 minutes aday. The new televisual experience provided an unusual opportunity for anaturalistic investigation to monitor children's social behaviour across theadvent of broadcast television.The island's education system is well developed. During the seven-year span of the study, a number of changes have taken place. In 1993there were six first schools (for 4- to 8-year-olds), three middle schools(8-12) and a secondary school (12+). Nursery provision was attached toeach first school, and became available to all children when they werethree and a half years old (in exceptional circumstances, younger childrencould be admitted). Although not obligatory, almost all children attended.By 2000, there were three first schools (for 4- to 7-year-olds), two middleschools (7-11), one amalgamated first/ middle school and one com-prehensive school (12+). Nursery class provision became available at the beginning of the academic year for children whose fourth birthdayoccurred in that year.METHODParticipantsParticipants in this studywere drawn from nursery cohorts in StHelena in 1993 and 2000. As the admissions policies for the two cohortswere different - and, consequently, the cohorts' age-ranges were disparate only similarly aged childrenwere drawn from the 1993 and 2000cohorts. Children were aged between 38 and 52 months in 1993 (23 boys,27 girls) and 2000 (18 boys, 17 girls). Mean ages for the samples were 3years 5 months (1993); and 3 years 7 months (2000).InstrumentThe Pre-school Behaviour Checklist (PBCL) was used by nurseryteachers to rate their children's behaviour in 1993 and 2000. The PBCL(McGuire & Richman, 1988) includes 22 items on emotional functioning,conduct problems, social relations and concentration (see TABLE 1).Two items refer to speech and language functioning. Most items allowrating choices between three behavioural descriptions, scoring 0 (noproblem), 1 (possible problem) or 2 (definite problem). The maximumscore obtainable is 44. 432NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY McGuire and Richman (1988) provide reliability and validity data.Test-retest reliability is given as .88 ( p < .0001) and internal consistencywas measured using Cronbach's alpha ( .83).

Six teachersundertook ratings in 1993 and four teachers in 2000. All raters werefemale. A researcher marked completed checklists. In the absence of adirectional hypothesis, data from the two cohorts with genders separatedwere subjected to two-tailed t tests. The t scores were calculated on theassumption of unequal variances.For the 2000 cohort a random sample of pupils (n=14) was rated again by nursery class assistants (N = 4) to provide an inter-raterreliability check. This was calculated by dividing the number of ratingagreements by the total number of ratings (Hall, 1974).RESULTSIndividual PBCL total scores for boys and girls in both cohorts werepositively skewed.

We return below to aconsideration of why our results run counter to so many others' findings,but in a word the key seems to be context.Of the six differences that the current study did discover between the 1993 and 2000 nursery cohorts, one stands out as the most robust,namely, that boys' concentration levels are rated as being significantlylower than in 1993. Its robustness derives from the fact that the other two comparisons carried out between the 1993 and subsequent nurserycohorts have yielded a similar picture (e.g. Charlton, Abrahams, & Jones,1995; Charlton, Panting, Coles, & Hannan., 1999). The explanation may be, as Singer and Singer (1986) have argued, that high-action and fast- paced TV programmes can induce a dependence upon external stimulithat can lead to \"increased restlessness in those children who have notalready acquired play skills\" (p.109). Thus, frequent exposure to fast- moving and action-packed TV (e.g. cartoons) may have adverselyaffected the 2000 cohort boys' concentration. Additionally, it has beenfound that children who are heavy viewers of cartoons are rated as low inenthusiasm by classroom teachers (Singer ,1982). However, in this studythe finding that girls' concentration did not fall appears to weaken thisargument. Further empirical work is planned to examine this apparent anomaly.Even so, the explanation for the gender difference in concentration between the cohorts may also be linked to a wider, albeit related,phenomenon. Specifically, over this period (the end of the 1990s) boys everywhere have been increasingly exposed to video and electronic games (arguably more than girls). Many of these games have thecharacteristics which Singer and Singer highlight (high action, fast-paced,etc.). Hence, the explanation for the boys' lowered concentration levelsmay be related to TV-watching in so far as this shares with video games and other 'action-packed' modern technology the characteristics sug- gested by Singer and Singer. There is a further, arguably more plausible(but not mutually exclusive), possibility. Maybe a generation of young children (especially boys) with high exposure to the kind of instantgratification given by electronic games of the 'action' variety will find itincreasingly difficult to apply their concentration to the more reflectiveactivities typical of the classroom.Gender differences of the above kind might, of course, have beenaffected by the gender of the raters, all of whom were female. However, in most school systems around the world, the teachers of the youngest children tend to be female and this was the case in St Helena. It is therefore possible that their ratings may have influenced the nature orextent of any sex differences in the results. We have no way of assessing 4. el`,--) 436NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY this. However, this situation was a constant and therefore sheds no lighton the changes in results over time. Future research will consider thisfactor as far as possible and also the possibility (remote, perhaps) that theexposure to broadcast television of the raters could have changed theirperception of the behaviour of their pupils over time.The other five differences between the 1993 and 2000 nursery cohortsare less robust, because they do not mirror differences found in the earliercohortstudies.For example,inanearlierstudyof 1993/1998comparisons, the boys not only showed poorer concentration but theywere more likely to be rated by their teachers as 'whining' and 'fearful'(e.g. Charlton, Abrahams, & Jones, 1995; Charlton, Panting, Coles, &Hannan, 1999). In the present study, these differences are not in evidence(at least at the level of statistical significance). On the other hand, the1993/1998 comparisons of the girls revealed no statistically significantdifferences at all, whereas the 2000 cohort of girls is rated as lesswhining.On these other five fronts, therefore, a closer analysis of thecharacteristics of the 2000 cohort in particular is being undertaken forlater publication. For example, the Island's policy in relation to FirstSchools and Nursery Classes changed in 2000 and it may be that some ofthe consequences of that policy change (on intake, age distribution, etc.)could have affected the findings.Nevertheless,themajorfindingsfromthepresentanalysescomplement well and reinforce other findings in the St Helena study. Forinstance, Charlton, Panting, Davie, Coles and Whitmarsh (2000) video-recorded and then coded children's playground behaviour before andeach subsequent year following the availability of TV, and failed todetect any increases in anti-social behaviour across that time period.However, the children's behaviour under investigation in that inquiryused an aggregate measure of youngsters' playground behaviour that wasunconnected to individuals' viewing experiences. This limitation wascorrected in the Gunter, Charlton, Panting and Coles' (2000) study,where they searched for links between children's anti-social behaviourand the amount of viewing undertaken as well as the amount of violenceviewed by individuals. They found that viewers' behaviour was notsignificantly correlated to either the amount of viewing undertaken or theamount of violence watched.The findings from three separate and independent measures com-paring children's social behaviour on pre- and post-TV occasions failedto uncover any evidence to support widespread claims that TV viewingper se encourages anti-social behaviour. Equally important, results fromanother study inthe St Helena project have suggested a way of443 Charlton, Davie, Panting, Abrahams, & Yon GETTING TV437 accounting for this apparent contradiction between findings from this study and those found elsewhere.Thus, one explanation for the tendency of the St Helenian children's good behaviour to remain relatively unaffected across the availability ofTV viewing derives from the notion that any TV-viewing effects (adverseor otherwise) can be expunged or moderated by situational or contextual factors. Evidence to support this explanation has emerged from a focusgroup discussion involving older secondary school students on the island.The conclusion was that it is difficult to indulge in anti-social behaviouron St Helena: \"because everyone watches you ... everyoneknows you... You've just behave.\" (Charlton, communitysocialcontrolsor'guardianship' behaviourswhich appeared to bemore influential inshaping children's behaviour than simple exposure to TV. This suggeststhat particular environmental factors can expunge or moderate any influences of exposure to TV violence (although, in terms of theexpression of, not the learning of, violent behaviours).The students' comments suggested one plausible explanation for thecontinuance of good behaviour even after the introduction of TV. In theirdiscussions, they referred toa 'neighbourhood watch' on St Helena; akind of informal pastoral network. Their comments implied that thiswatchfulness encouraged youngsters to become answerable to others (i.e.,to give reckonings or explanations for their behaviour). In tandem, this watchfulness and the answerability linked to it, appeared to underpingoodsocialbehaviourbyestablishing common expectations for behaviour across homes, schools, and community. In other words,children's behaviour was shaped largely by environmental (situational) influences or cues, whichwere both consistent and beneficial. Thisthinking is not new. It has become a central tenet within most sociallearning theories. For example, Mischel (1977) expounded the power of situational determinants, and Rotter's (1966) social learning theory highlighted the import of the 'psychologicalsituation'in shaping behaviour. Moreover, such thinking was tested empirically by Potts,Huston and Wright (1986). They studied the influence upon young boys' behaviour of a systematic manipulation of situational cues (in this case,aggressively and pro-socially cued toys) after exposing the youngsters to varied TV stimuli (i.e., high and low action, high and low violence).Their results showed that particular environmental attributes can expungethe influences of exposure to TV violence (in terms of the expression of, not the learning of, violent behaviours). The nature of the above thinking and findings suggeststhe conclusion thatinwatchful and caringenvironments, dominant determinants of behaviour can exclude TV. 438NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The influence of environmental factors has also been stressedelsewhere. Social controls have been noted at work in small and mainlyruralcommunities. Valentine (1997), for example, maintained that incommunities where most people are known to most others, feelings ofbeing watched over are commonplace because of the 'eyes on the street'(p.144) that keep young and old alike under surveillance. Likewise,Cohen (1982) talks of individuality giving way to communality, andJones (1999, p.9) refers to the 'power of gossip' in establishingconformity. Another (related) perspective argues for the importance ofsocial capital (e.g. the extent to which children have others to draw uponfor support and help) in determining their behaviour (Amato & Booth,2000). Comment of this kind draws attention to social controls of onetype or another with the potential to affect, favourably or otherwise,individuals' behaviour.These kinds of explanations and models are perhaps strengthened inrelation to the present study by reported crime rates on St. Helena, whichhave remained low across nearly six years of broadcast TV; indeed crimefigures (including violent crime) were most recently reported as beinghalved (\"Half Year Figures.\" Vol. 2: Summary report. 2000). Again, thisis an area that merits more detailed examination.The major finding, thus far, from this study and the wider St HelenaTV project, is that in the short-term (i.e. after nearly six years of TV) - contrary to most other research findings TV viewing does notunequivocallyorinevitablyinfluencechildren'ssocialbehaviour.Although a few significant (and interesting not to say, puzzling)differences have emerged between children's pre- and post-TV behaviour,none of these was related to aggressive or anti-social tendencies.REFERENCESAmato, P.

Generallythecorrelationsbetween thevariables wereconsistent with predictions. Further tests the absorption-addiction model. Specifically, the Entertainment-Social sub-scale of the CAS accounted for unique variance in SocialDysfunction, and Depressive Symptoms, while the Intense-Personal sub-scale accounted for unique variance in Depression and Anxiety scores.We argue that the positive relationship between Celebrity worship andpoorer psychological well-being results from (failed) attempts to escape,cope, or enhance one's daily life.Two competing characterizations of celebrity worship have domi-nated the social scientific literature. One of these suggests that celebrityworship is an expression of pathology. Anecdotal evidence is usuallycitedforthisposition, and includes fans' obsession with certaintelevision programmes (Jindra, 1994), the attempts to harm celebrities(Caughey, 1978; Giles, 2000; Schickel, 1985), the threatening letters theymail to movie and television stars (Dietz, Matthews, Van Duyne, Martell,Parry, Stewart, Warren, & Crowder, 1991), and fans' apparent confusionbetween celebrities' fictional Klapp, 1962).Author info: School ofHealth, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, England, S10 2BP.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 3, 441-452.\u00a9 NAJP448 442NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Other commentators offera different view of celebrity worship. Forexample, Jenkins (1992) and Jenson (1992) proposed a complicatedcultural interaction between fans and celebrity worship. They argue that, rather than pointing to pathology, we need to emphasise the active,positive role that these fans undertake in creating and maintaining socialnetworks around their favorite celebrities. As such, celebrity worshipmight reflect the development of a deeper appreciation and enthusiasm for particular people and their talents (Giles, 2000; Jenkins, 1992;Jenson, 1992).Except for the initial reports of interview data (Giles, 2000), there hasbeen littleempirical evidence to support either characterization ofcelebrity worship. Furthermore, commentators make little anecdotaldistinction in the literature between examples of extreme behaviour onthe part of fans and how being involved in celebrity worship might haveother (even positive) consequences for people. Indeed, at least three differenthypothesesof how celebrityworship might impact anindividual's psychological well being can be formulated. We reviewthese next.Speculations on the Relation of Celebrity Worshipto Psychological Well-BeingOur introduction provides the basis for three viewpoints concerningthe relationship between celebrity worship and psychological well being.First, celebrity worship can be seen as detrimental to the individual.Here, celebrity worship is typically characterised by a single individualobsessed by a particular celebrity (Dietz, et al. 1991; Giles, 2000), the\"worshipper\"isusuallyaloneintheworshippingactivities(andsometimes lonely in their activity; Rubin, Perse, & Powell, 1985), andthe individual demonstrates some aspect of pathology. In other words,such an individual would have poor psychological functioning and well-being.Recently, McCutcheon, Lange, and Houran (in press) provided strong empirical evidence for the generalpathological view of celebrityworship. Using statistical tests for dimensionality (Rasch modeling andtests for differential item functioning), these authors analysed a large setof questions about celebrity worshipping behaviours. Several novelfindings emerged. Specifically, items not discarded due to age or genderbias formed a unidimensional hierarchy that applied to many types ofcelebrities(e.g.,actors,musicians,sportsfigures).Moreover, the analyses did not reveal any compelling evidence to conceptualisecelebrity worship as having distinct non-pathological and pathologicalforms.Instead, the \"Rasch\" nature of the items defines celebrity worship asconsisting of three qualitatively different stages on McCutcheon, Ashe, & Houran CELEBRITIES443 (McCutcheonetal.,inpress).Inparticular,lowworship,asoperationalized by low scores on the CAS, involves individualisticbehaviours such as watching and reading about a celebrity. At slightlyhigher levels, celebrity worship takes on a social character. Lastly, thehighest levels are characterized by a mixture of empathy with thecelebrity's successes and failures, over-identification with the celebrity,and compulsive behaviours, as well as obsession with details of thecelebrity's life. Based on these findings, the authors (McCutcheon et al.,in press) proposed a model of celebrity worship based on psychologicalabsorption. This absorption is promoted by an attempt to establish asense of identityand fulfilment(leadingtodelusionsof actualrelationships with celebrities) and later reinforced by addiction (fosteringthe need for progressively stronger involvement to feel connected withthe celebrity). The factor analysis (Maltby, Houran, Lange, Ashe, &McCutcheon, in press) of a modified version of McCutcheon et al.'s (inpress) original questionnaire likewise validated this basic notion of threeexpressions of celebrity worship an entertainment/ social dimension,intense personal feelings toward a celebrity, and borderline pathology.However, a second and contrasting view of celebrity worship arguesthat this behaviour is potentially beneficial to the individual, providedthat the individual is participating in a social network of fans. In thisrespect, celebrity worship involves nothing more than an individualattending conferences or sharing information and experiences withfriends (or with individuals on the Internet). Such behaviours mightpromote productive social relationships and serve as a psychologicalbufferagainstevery-daystressors.Accordingtothislogic,theconsequences of socially based adulation can be beneficial to theindividual.Finally, we must consider the possibility that there is no simplerelationship between celebrity worship and a person's psychological wellbeing. That is,there is a complex cultural interaction between theindividual and celebrity worship (Jenkins, 1992; Jenson, 1992), based onan appreciation of ability and the medium, which is more dynamic than iscaptured in a correlational analysis. Therefore, this perspective mightsuggest that thereis no theoretical reason to hypothesise a directrelationship between celebrity and psychological well-being.Testing the Relation of Celebrity Worship to Psychological Well-BeingThe theoriesoutlined above characterise celebrityworshippersdifferently. While one viewpoint emphasises the individual as obsessive,alone, and showing poorer psychological well-being, another viewpointemphasises celebrity worship as beneficial, with the individual integratedinto a social world, gaining social skills and support from participating in450 444NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY celebrity worship. Thus, it would seem prudent to make such distinctionswhen examining psychological and behavioural correlates of celebrityworship (or its hypothesized stages).Recent research with the Celebrity Attitude Scale (McCutcheon et al.,in press) among UK samples (Maltby et al., in press) suggests that thisscale can be used to reflect distinctions among the three different stagesor aspects of celebrity worship.' In particular, the first factor is an\"Entertainment-social\" factor comprising items like \"My friends and Ilike to discuss what my favourite celebrity has done [item 4]\", and\"Learning the life story of my favourite celebrity is a lot of fun [item15].\" This subscale reflects social aspects to Celebrity worship and isconsistent with Stever's (1991) observation that fans were primarilyattracted to their favourite celebrity because of their perceived ability toentertain. Rubin and McHugh (1987) made a similar observation. Both ofthese studies referred to this as \"task attraction.\"The second factor is labelled \"Intense-personal,\" and is exemplifiedby items like \"I consider my favourite celebrity to be my soul mate [item10]\", and \"I have frequent thoughts about my celebrity, even when Idon't want to [item 11]\". It can be suggested that this scale measuresindividuals' intensive and compulsive feelings around the celebrity,reflective of the obsessional tendencies of fans often referred to in theliterature (Dietz, et al., 1991).The third factor, labeled \"Borderline pathological,\" is exemplified byitems like \"If someone gave me several thousand dollars to do with as I please, I would consider spending it on a personal possession (like anapkin or paper plate) once used by my favourite celebrity [item 20],\"and \"If I were lucky enough to meet my favourite celebrity, and he/sheasked me to do something illegal as a favour I would probably do it [item17].\" The sub-scale seems to reflect some of the extreme attitudesindividuals may hold regarding their favourite celebrity.The General Health Questionnaire - 28 is an easily administered, selfreport,screeningdevicedesignedtorevealsymptoms of poorpsychological health. Factor one was labelled Somatic Symptoms; factortwo is anxiety and insomnia, factor three is social dysfunction and four issevere depression. Both the 28-item version and the 60-item version fromwhich itis derived have been shown to possess good psychometricproperties (Goldberg & Williams, 1991). I It remains to beseen whether these three factors show a similar Raschhierarchy (or progression) as reported in McCutcheon et al. (in press), butwe feel it is encouraging that the Maltby et al. (in press) findings alsosuggested that celebrity worship involves three aspects that appear tocoincide in content with the three hierarchial stages found byMcCutcheon et al. (in press).451 Maltby, McCutcheon, Ashe, & Houran CELEBRITIES445 These two measures allow us to test the three theories reviewed.Specifically, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationshipbetween the three aspects of celebrity worship (Entertainment-Social,Intense-personal and Border- line-Pathological) and psychological wellbeing.Specifically,wewishedtodeterminewhetherdifferentpsychological variables motivate the three different expressions ofcelebrity worship as predicted by McCutcheon et al.'s (in press) model ofcelebrity worship.METHODMeasures1. The Celebrity Attitude Scale (CAS). The CAS is a 34-item Likertscale with \"strongly agree\" equal to 5 and \"strongly disagree\" equal to 1.From analysis reported in Maltby, et al. (in press), three subscales wereformed from 23 of the items; Entertainment/Social; Intense-Personal, andBorderline pathological.2. The General Health Questionnaire 28 (Goldberg & Williams,1991). Each of these scales comprises 7-item measures of depressivesymptoms, anxiety symptoms, social dysfunction and somatic symptoms.Responses are scored on a 4-point scale ranging from (0) Better thanusual, (1) Same as Usual, (2) Worse than Usual, (3) Much Worse thanusual. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of self-reporting of each ofthe symptoms.ParticipantsA convenience sample of 126 men (M age =26.97 years, SD = 6.8,range = 18 to 48) and 181 women (M age = 27.67 years, SD = 7.9, range= 18 to 48) was recruited from a number of workplaces and communitygroups in the South Yorkshire region of England. The most frequentlycited demographic categories were Caucasian (n = 220), single (n = 144),employed (n = 196), and an \"0\" educational level or its equivalent (n =85), which approximates a high school education in the United States.The number of recruits who declined to participate or failed to completethe scales was 22. Data using the Celebrity Attitude Scale here have beenreported elsewhere (Maltby et al. in press), however, the correlationsreported among all the variables measured in this study have not beenreported elsewhere.ProcedureParticipants were told their responses were confidential and that thepurpose of the study was to examine a number of psychological factorsthat may be related to individuals' interest in famous people. The scaleswere presented to participants in different orders to reduce the probability 4, 446NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY of a systematic order effect. Participants completed the scales in a singlesession in small groups at their workplace or community meetings.RESULTSPreliminaries.Table 1 shows mean scores and standard deviations for each measure.There were no significant sex differences for any of the scales, and noneof the t values were higher than .54. Therefore, in the following analyses,data for men and women were combined. TABLE 1: Means (standard deviations) for all the scales by sex.Scales 03.22(03.2)03.17(02.9)7. Depression 01.85(01.8)02.00(02.2) Main FindingsTable 2 gives the Pearson product moment correlations between allthe variables. All of the Celebrity Attitude Subscales significantly andpositively correlated with one another. Scores for the Entertainment-Social Celebrity Attitude subscale correlated positively and significantlywith Anxiety, Social Dysfunction, and Depressive Symptoms, and boththe Intense-Personal and Borderline Pathological Celebrity Attitudesubscales correlatedsignificantly and positively with Anxiety andDepressive Symptoms.Table 3 depicts these relationships in the context of the hypothesizedprogression of the stages of celebrity worship (cf. McCutcheon et al., inpress). Specifically, we propose that celebrity worship begins at theEntertainment/Social stage, progresses to an Intense-Personal dimension,and finally reaches the Borderline pathological domain. Assuming thisprogression is valid, we find that the initial stage of celebrity worship ismarked by a component of social dysfunction, as would be expected ifthis stage is motivated by psychological absorption, i.e., a yearning tosoothe \"the empty self\" due to the worshipper's likely introverted of meaningful relationships (Willis, 1972; 1977;Stever, 1995; Meloy, 1998). The next stage (Intense-Personal domain)involves anxiety and depression as well, but now takes on a somatic Maltby, McCutcheon, Ashe, & Houran CELEBRITIES447 quality that we hypothesize reflects the now addictive component tocelebrity worship. Finally, the Borderline-Pathology domain shows anexclusive mix of anxiety and depressive symptomatology, whichparallels the progressive absorption-addiction model of celebrity worshipthat we proposed earlier (McCutcheon et al., in press). TABLE 2: Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients between 3 Comparison of Pearson Correlations Between Indices ofPsychological Well Being and the Three HypothesizedStages of Celebrity Worship Stage 1:Stage 2:Stage Highlighted coefficients visually indicate which psychological variablesare most associated with each stage of celebrity worship.To test the validity of these conclusions we conducted a standardmultiple regression to examine which of the Celebrity Attitude sub-scalesscores accounted for unique variance in Anxiety and Depression. Weexpected that depressive symptoms (including social dysfunction) aremost indicative of the initial stages of celebrity worship (the absorptioncomponent due to a lack of identity) whereas anxiety would bemanifested in the later stages (due to increasing thresholds to satisfy the54 448NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY addiction to the celebrity). Table 4 shows the results of two standardmultiple regressions performed with each of the Celebrity Attitude subscales(Entertainment-Social;Intense-Personal,andBorderline- Pathological) used as independent variables, and the Anxiety andDepression used as dependent variables. Included in these tables are theunstandardised regression coefficients (B), the standardised regression coefficients (B),the semipartial correlations (sr2), r, r2 and adjusted r2. TABLE 4 Multiple Regression Analyses Using all Three CelebrityAttitude Sub-scales as Independent For Anxiety, the regression statistic (r) was significantly different from zero (F(3,303) =8.837, p<.001, with the Intense-Personal subscaleaccounting for unique variance in Anxiety scores. For depressivesymptoms, the regression statistic (r) was significantly different fromzero (F(3,303) =10.639, p<.001), with the Entertainment-Social and Intense-Personal subscale accounting for uniquevariance in depressive symptom scores.DISCUSSIONThe pattern of resultsisconsistent with predictions from theabsorption-addiction model of celebrity worship (McCutcheon et al., in press),andthussuggeststhatcelebrityworshipreflectspoorer psychological well-being. This conclusion holds even for the initialstages of celebrity worship that do not appear pathological. For instance,the Entertainment-Social stage accounts for unique variance in Social Dysfunction and Depressive Symptoms, and celebrity worship forIntense-Personal reasons accounts for unique variance in Depression and Anxiety scores.Using these relationships itis possible to refine our absorption-addiction model of celebrity worship (McCutcheon et al., in press).Superficiallyit may seem contradictory that celebrity worship forEntertainment-Social reasons is accompanied by Social Dysfunction.55 Maltby, McCutcheon, Ashe, & Houran CELEBRITIES449 However, if these significant positive correlations are placed in contextof some of the items ( \"It is enjoyable just to be with others who like myfavourite celebrity\" [item 23] and, \"One of the main reasons I maintainan interest in my favourite celebrity is that doing so gives me a temporaryescape from life's problems\" [item 8], then we suggest that this celebrityworship domain represents a person's attempt to establish an identity.Alternatively, it may be the only way the person is able to interact withothersa socially dysfunctional individual whose social life is solelybased on worshipping a celebrity. This view is supported by the fact thatthe Entertainment-Social domain accounted for unique variance in themeasure of depressive symptoms. As such, we would characterise highscorers on this domain as persons with little interest in anything apartfrom their chosen celebrity. Future research may find that individuals inthis stage of celebrity worship use their interest in celebrities as a copingmechanism to deal with the stressors of daily life.Scores on the Celebrity Attitude Intense-Personal domain account forunique variance in Anxiety, and to a lesser extent Depressive symptoms.The relationship between this aspect of Celebrity worship and Anxiety isperhaps less surprising given that some of the items of the scale \"(I amobsessed by details of my favourite celebrity's life [item 3]\") may reflectobsessional (i.e., addictive) tendencies, and anxiety is thought to berelatedto obsessionality (Sandler & Hazari, 1960). Therefore, thisfinding perhaps locates this type of celebrity worship securely within anAnxiety/Obsessionality domain. In addition, higher scores on the Intense-Personal domain were associated with higher scores on depressivesymptoms. One explanation for this finding is that both anxiety andobsessional-neurotic traits are related to depression & Straube, 1998).Therefore, previous literature provides a context to understand whyindividuals experiencing Intense-Personal feelings in relation to theirfavourite celebrity also report depression. Further research might usemeasures of obsessionality, neuroticism, and other related constructs tofurther explore the Intense-personal aspect of Celebrity Worship.Finally, scores on the Borderline-Pathological domain do not accountfor unique variance in any of the psychological well-being measures.Instead, any significant relationship found between this aspect ofCelebrity Worship and the psychological variables might be betterconsideredwithintheothertwoaspectsof CelebrityWorship.Methodological limitations in our study also may have contributed to thefact that the Borderline-Pathological domain did not account for uniquevariance in poorer psychological well being. For example, the mentalhealth measures we used do not cover those domains that might beexpected with this type of pathological behaviour. The General Health 450NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Questionnaire is designed for use among non-clinical populations, andtherefore further research is needed to examine what particular aspects ofpsychological well being are most relevant to the Borderline-pathologicaldomain. However, the present study provides no evidence that theBorderline-Pathological domain of celebrity worship is related to a richerpsychological well being.Further research is needed to explore the possible psychologicalprocesses that mediate our proposed absorption-addiction model ofcelebrity worship, which places this phenomenon in the context of(failed)attemptsto escape, cope, or enrich one's everyday life.McCutcheon et al.'s (in press) model is a first approximation of acohesive interpretation of the empirical research on celebrity worship.Future studies may suggest more viable models. Our understanding ofthe precise cognitive and emotional dynamics that underlie celebrityworship is inits infancy, but the available evidence indicates thatcelebrity worship is a behavioural expression of poor global psych-ological well being.

Thecurriculum presents postponement of intercourse until after marriage as a necessary prerequisitefor long-term satisfaction ina healthy andfulfillinglife.In addition to factual information regarding sexualbehavior,pregnancy,childrearingandtheirconsequences,thecurriculum emphasizes skills for goal setting, decision making, effectivecommunication, and self-esteem enhancement areas commonly addressedby drug education curricula. Impact of exposure to the curriculum on useof alcohol, cigarettes and illicit drugs, therefore, seems to be a reasonablesubject of investigation. Post-test comparisons revealed no differences between the groups in terms of drug attitudes or the use of alcohol,marijuana, or cigarettes. Students at comparison schools reported greater increases in use of stimulants and of cocaine/crack than did thoseattending intervention schools.The two topics most often addressed in health education curricula aredrugs and sex. Behavioral decisions made in these areas can be powerfuldeterminants of overall health and well being. Both drug use and sexualactivity necessitate decision-making, as both involve a degree of risk.Indeed, sexual activity among adolescents results in an estimated one million teen pregnancies per year in the U.S., 78% of which areunplanned (Guttmacher Institute, 1999). In addition, three million teensacquire a sexually transmitted disease each year (Guttmacher Institute,1999). Monitoring the Future, a continuing study by the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA of drug use trends among America'syouth has found that 80% of all high school seniors have used alcohol;65%have smoked cigarettes; 50% have used marijuana and 10% haveAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Joseph Donnelly, Dept. ofHealth Professions, Montclair State U., Upper Montclair, NJ 07043.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 3, 453-462.\u00a9 NAJP459 454NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY used cocaine (Johnston, O'Malley & Bachman, 2000). Besides having aprofound impact on young people's health, substance use by youngpeople has serious and costly consequences for society as well. The totalcost of alcohol use by youth including traffic crashes, violent crime,burns, drowning, suicide attempts, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, alcoholpoisoning and treatment - has been estimated to be more than $58 billionper year (Levy & Stewart, 1999).The skills needed to successfully navigate choices related to both sexand drug use are the same - communication, self-esteem, resistance andrefusal, and decision-making. Mayer (1999) maintains that the two majorcomponents of a successful substance abuse prevention program are\"normativeeducation\"andresistanceskills.Normative educationinvolves teaching adolescents that using drugs is not acceptable and thateveryone is not doing it. Resistance skills are about learning how to sayno to drugs in different social situations.A report called \"Making the Grade: A Guide to School DrugPrevention Programs,\" identifies characteristics of a good school-basedprevention program. It is one which promotes the development of refusalskills; helps students recognize internal and external pressures; teachesabout the short- and long-term consequences of drug use; involves familyand community; and uses culturally relevant materials (Drug Strategies,1996).Low self-esteem in children may make them vulnerable to drug abuseand other risk-taking behaviors as adolescents (Reasoner, 2000). In astudy of 1,228 teens aged 14-17, Hofler & Lieb (1999) explored riskfactors for progressive use of marijuana. Significant predictors of of substance abuse, self-esteem, unconditional commitment to notusing drugs, immediate availability of drugs, peer group use and previoushistory of nicotine and alcohol abuse. Low self-esteem and a lack ofcommitment to not use drugs were found to be powerful risk factors foruse and \"regular use\" of marijuana.Kawabata, Cross, Nishioka, and Shimai (1999) examined the re-lationship between self-esteem and smoking behavior among 2,090Japanese students in grades 4-9. They found that students who had eversmoked showed significantly lower self-esteem in perceived cognitiveand family relationship subscales than students who had never smoked.Based on theirfindings, theauthors suggest that future smokingprevention programs targeted for early adolescence should be integratedinto more comprehensive health education programs, which include self-esteem enhancement training. Donnelly, Ferraro, & Eadie EFFECTS OF HEALTH455 Communication is another skill essential to negotiating choices about sex and drug use. A study reviewing peer-led drug preventionprograms across North America found that the peer-led programs were superior to teacher-led programs in their effect on student use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco (Black & Tobler, 1998). The peer-ledprograms produced significant changes in cognition and attitudeamong middle school children. The same study found that interactiveprograms, involving face- to-face communicationamong peers, were most effective. Inthis approach, students learn from each other through roleplays, modeling skills, and giving and receiving feedback. Peermentors and mediatorsare also thought to benefit by gaining leadership and problem-solving skills, better communication, andan improved self-esteem (Humphries, 1999). Many sexuality educationcurricula also focuson developing self- efficacy, self-esteem, resistance and refusal skills andsocial support (Donnelly, Goldfarb, Duncan, Young, Eadie & Castiglia,1999; Ferguson, 1998). Ferguson (1998) evaluated the effects ofpeer counseling in a culturally specific adolescent pregnancy program. Sixty-three African American females between the ages of 12 and 16 participated in the eight-week long program, which involved discussions androle-playing regarding peer pressure,decision-making, communication, and leadership skills, from an Afrocentricperspective. It was foundthat none of the participants who receivedpeer counseling becamepregnant after three months, although thisoutcome may be due to the fact that many of them had been sexually inactivebefore the intervention.Although it is difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the program forpregnancy prevention, participants did showan increase in their knowledge related to sex, reproduction, STDs and contraceptives.Whitbeck, Yoder, Hoyt, andConger (1999) usedan event history analysis to examine predictors of early sexual intercoursefor a sample of 457 adolescents in grades8-10. They found that theprimary predictors of early intercoursewere age, opportunity, sexually permissive attitudes, associationwithdelinquentpeers,andalcoholuse.Regarding psychological characteristics of adolescents, the authors found that higher levels of self-esteem andself-confidence were negatively related to early intercourse.O'Sullivan (1999) studiedmother-daughter communication about sexuality within minority families. As part of an HIV-intervention study, 110 Hispanic adolescent girls (ages 13-18) and their mothers completed questionnaires assessing communication patterns and adolescent sexual behavior. It was found that the quality of general communication between mothers and daughterswas more useful in predicting the onset of sexual experiences than specificcommunication about sex. 456NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY A report issued by the National Center on Addiction and SubstanceAbuse (1999) recommends that substance use and sex should beaddressed together in prevention programs. The report is based onanalyses of national data sets encompassing more than 34,000 teenagers,as well as reviews of hundreds of relevant articles. The report found thatthere is a strong connection between substance use and sexual behavioramong teenagers. For example, 63 percent of teens who use alcohol and70 percent of those who drink frequently have had sex, compared with 26percent of teens who have never used alcohol. Similarly, 72 percent ofteens who use drugs and 81 percent who are heavy drug users have hadsex, compared with 36 percent of those who have never used drugs. Thisstudy suggests that teens who engage in one high-risk behavior are morelikely to engage in another, thus it is recommended that schools createcomprehensive education programs addressing the relationship betweensubstance abuse andsex (Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Weekly,December, 1999).Because of the overlap in fundamental information presented tostudents through sex education and drug education, it seems likely thatsex education would have an effect on students' drug behavior and drugeducation would have an effect on students' sexual behavior. The presentstudyaskswhetherProject CARE (Community Awareness &Relationship Education), a relationship education program aimed atpostponing sexual intercourse had any impact on drug use amongstudents.Project CARE is a three-year intervention using an abstinence basedsexuality education curriculum. Changes in student attitudes and behaviorwere evaluated during the first year of the program (Goldfarb, Donnelly,Duncan, Young, Eadie & Castiglia, 1999). Significant differences werefound which, although small, can be attributed to change intheinterventiongroup.Intermsof behavioral outcome,interventionparticipants reported a significantly lower incidence of sexual intercoursethan did the control group and were less likely to believe that they wouldhavesexualintercoursebeforefinishinghighschool.Giventhecommonalties between the issues addressed in this curriculum, such asdecision-making, self-esteem and communications skills,and thoseaddressed in many drug education curricula, it seemed reasonable toexpect that this intervention would have some impact on drug attitudes orbehaviors. Donnelly, Ferraro, &EadieEFFECTS OF HEALTH457 METHODProcedureProject CARE isa community test of the effectiveness of an abstinence sexuality education program, the focus of which is to delay the initiation of sexual activityamong young adolescents. The interventionconsists of the Sex Can Wait upper elementary (Young & Young, 1997b) and middle school curricula(Core-Gebhart, Hart, &Young, 1997), and the Abstinence: Pick and Choose Activities book (Young & Young, 1997a) implemented respectively in grades six,seven and eight. This intervention clearly promotes sexual abstinence while providingfactual information regarding sexual behavior, adolescentpregnancy, child rearing and theirconsequences. In addition, the curricula emphasize skills for goal setting, decision-making, effective communication, and self- esteem enhancement. (Core-Gebhart, Hart, & Young, 1997).Unlike many abstinence-only curricula that use fear and moral preaching to get their messageacross, Sex Can Wait portrays sexuality as a healthy, normal and very positiveaspect of human life. Within this context, it promotes abstinence from sexual intercourse as the best choice young adolescents can make to maintain their physical, psychological andsocial health.The Sex Can Wait series has three age-appropriate curricula: upper elementary, middle school, and high school. The curriculum is modified for each grade level, in order to retain the interest level of students. In this study, the upper elementary and middle school componentsare utilized in grades six and seven, respectively, and the relatedprogram, Abstinence: Pick and Choose Activities, is being implemented in the eighth grade. The curricula are driven by the principles of social learning theory, including emphasison susceptibility, self-efficacy, social support, peer norms, and skill building. One of the strengths of the curriculum is its user-friendly format, which includes a lesson overview, behavioral objectives, a time estimate, and teacher instructions. It also includes handouts, parent-child homework assignments, guidelines for teacher implementations, and information for parents on how to communicate with their children aboutsex.As part of Project CARE, intervention group teachers participate in a three-day intensive training workshop on the implementation of the Sex Can Wait curriculum. Teachers then administer a pre-test questionnaire to students, designed tomeasure sexuality-related attitudes, behaviors,behavioral intentions, and knowledge. Students then receive twenty-three sessions of the Sex Can Wait curriculum throughout the schoolyear. At the end of the year, teachers administer a post-test questionnaire. 458NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Teachers in the control/comparison group schools received a one-dayworkshop in the administration of the questionnaire and then admin-istered a pre-test to their students before beginning whatever healtheducation curricula were already in place. Teachers administered a post-test upon completion of their curricula.MeasuresThe evaluationinstrument was a47-item questionnaire.Fivequestions assessed demographic information, nine related to self-esteem,fifteen to attitudes regarding sexuality, four to sexuality knowledge, nineto behaviors, and five to behavioral intentions. All self-esteem and someattitude questions were assessed via a four-point Likert-type scale. Theself-esteem scale had a coefficient alpha internal consistency reliability of.75. Items such as \"My parents are proud of the kind of person I am\"were followed by a four-point response ranging from \"strongly agree\" to\"strongly disagree\". Attitude questions were true/false, such as \"I feel thatthere is nothing wrong with a person my age smoking cigarettes.\"Behaviors and behavioral intentions were assessed using Likert-typescales or yes-no responses. This instrument was constructed for theproject and items came from Kirby's national evaluation of sexualityeducation programs (1985) and from the original evaluation project forSex Can Wait (Denny, Young, & Spear, 1995).ParticipantsEvaluation was based on a classic pre-post control group design. Thecurriculum was implemented in classes at three intervention schools in anurban setting. Three control schools continued their usual curricularofferings but were prevented from adopting the intervention curricula.Students in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades at each school completed(subject to passive parental consent) a pretest survey which was repeatedas a post-test at the end of the academic year. Posttest survey results from839 students were examined, with 426 students (227 females and199males) from intervention schools and 413 students (211 females and 202males) from control schools.Fewer than 2% of the students did not participate due to lack ofparental consent. Passive parental consent was approved by the MontclairState University Internal Review Board Human Subjects Committee as anappropriate means of consent for this population. All parents received apassive consent form discussing the questionnaire and program. Theywere instructed to return the form with their signature if they did notapprove of their child's participation in the program or in completing thequestionnaire. Donnelly, Ferraro, & Eadie EFFECTS OF HEALTH459 Data analysis was nonparametric in nature, involving no a priori assumptions about the underlying distributional characteristics of the data. Analysis included pre to post comparisons for the total subject population and for the intervention and control groups separately,as well as posttest only comparisons between the intervention and control groups.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWhile pretest comparisons had shown the intervention and control groups to be comparable, this was not true for all variables for the students completing the posttest. At posttest, there was a small but significant difference (p < .02) in the age distribution of the two groups, such that fewer of the control subjects fell within the oldest agegroup and highest grade in school. Given that likelihood of drug use increases withage among adolescents, this creates a small bias against finding a positive impact of the interventionon drug use behavior.TABLE 1Prevalence of Drug Use for Past that a majority (53.7%) of theintervention students lived ina house, while a minority (46.3%) of thecontrol students lived in a house (p < .04). This may reflect an unintended socioeconomic bias in the posttest sample resulting from differential attrition from the pretestgroup. There were no other significant differences between thegroups in terms of either demographics or living arrangements. The two groups did not differ significantly in either their frequency of attendance at religious services or their self-assessed degree of religiosity.Improved self-esteem was one of the objectives of the curriculum and was measured by nine items on the survey. No differences between the groups were found on the students' responses to either the statement that, \"I think that I have good personal qualities,\" \"I am comfortable making 460NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY my own decisions,\" and \"I know what to do in order to reach my life'sgoals.\" Nearly 90% of the students had endorsed each of these items atpretest, leaving little room for improvement. The change from pretest toposttest was, in fact, less than 1% on each item.Small but significant (p < .02) differences between the two groupswere found on threeself-esteemitems.Students exposedtothecurriculum were more likely than control students to agree or stronglyagree that, \"I value respect for myself and others\" and that \"I can seemyself graduating from high school\". On the other hand, control studentswere more likely to agree or strongly agree that, \"I feel good aboutmyself on a regular basis\". In each case more than 80% of both groupsagreed with the item and the difference was between 3.5 and 6.9% in theproportion agreeing.No group differences were found on items intended to measure socialsupport derived from family and friends, such as \"I am an importantperson to my family\", and \"My parent(s)/guardian(s) believe that I will bea success in the future.\" Again this was largely due to the fact that moststudents responded favorably on these items at pretest.As can be seen in Table 1, the intervention and control students didnot differ significantly in the proportions reporting past month use ofalcohol, tobacco, marijuana, inhalants, cocaine/crack, or heroin. Controlswere significantly methamphetamine (commonlyknown as \"crank\" or \"ice\"). Self-reported use of crank or ice hadincreased significantly in both groups from pre to post reported by1.4% of controls at pretest and 5.1% a year later (p < .002), and by 0.5%and 2.3% of intervention subjects over the same period (p < .02). Use ofcocaine or crack also increased significantly in the control group, from1.6% to 3.9% (p < .05) but not in the intervention group, which increasedonly slightly, from 1.5% to 1.9%.The results of this evaluation do not suggest that a relationship basedsex education curricula had meaningful spillover effects on drug-relatedbehaviors. In general the results are consistent with the view proposed byKirby et al. (1994) that effective health behavior change will result onlyfrom narrowly focused curricula with specific behavioral goals.A difference was found, however, in the prevalence of use ofamphetamines\"crank\" or \"ice.\" Furthermore, cocaine use increasedfrom pre to post among controls but not intervention subjects Thesedifferencescould, of course, be due solely tochance.Itseemsworthwhile, however, to consider the possibility that the small minority ofstudents at risk for use of these drugs might be a group particularly inneed of assistance with problems of relationships, communications andself-esteem. Further examination of this issue seems to be indicated.

The application ofmany paradigms has been used to discernpatterns of reciprocity in dyadic interaction: interpersonal, intergroup,inter-organizational, and international inter- action. The advancement ofdyadic relations and reciprocity research requires both theoretical and methodological innovationsto further our understanding of the elusivenature of patterns of reciprocity (Baldwin, 1998; Druckman, 1998; Larson, 1998). Stern and Druckman(2000) have suggested that research ininternational relations requires the exegesis of conceptual issues of thenature of actions pertinentto the process of reciprocity. This paperpresents an innovation in reciprocity research by the introduction of the Attribution Reciprocity (AR) model. The AR model presentsatheoreticalcatalystfor development of dyadic interaction and reciprocity research. This article examines theapplication of attribution theory to thedyadic interactions of nationstates.The analysis of reciprocalactions taken by nationscan benefit from an understanding of the attribution process.In past studies,a nation's propensity to engage in reciprocity and the type of reciprocalinteraction has subsumed themultidimensional complexityof attribution states within a continuum of conflict and cooperation. Numerousscholars have studied and investigatedvarious conceptualizationsof the cooperative and conflictive hasfocused on a continuum ofconflict and cooperation. Recently, Stern and Druckman (2000) havesuggested that the advancement of reciprocity research in international relations requires the clarification of conceptual issues of the codification ofactions. A significant development in the analytic precision of reciprocity research is possible with theunderstanding of the attribution states of international interactants.

The attributionreciprocity (AR) modeldeveloped in this paper provides a unique opportunity to clarify somepersistent conceptual issues in the study of reciprocity in internationalrelations (Weiner, 1972, 1979, 1992; 1995; 1998; Weiner & Litman-Adizes, 1980; Weiner, Nierenberg, & Goldstein, 1976).Reciprocity between nation states has been examined in terms of thelevels of cooperation and The utility of a uni-dimensonal cooperationconflict scale has been used to rate the implicit actions of the leadershipof nationstates and their publicstatements on the character ofinternational Rosenau, 1988; Larson, 1998; Parks &Komorita, Patchen, 1998). This understanding theaction or event's cooperative and conflictive valence and the effect ofthat interpretation of events on our capacity to detect the presence ofpatterns of reciprocity is basically an exercise in attribution analysis.Therefore, one's understanding of the process of reciprocity can benefit-from a theoretical perspective that improves one's understanding of thekey elements of interaction. Attribution theory can illuminate theattribution states of the interactants and those states' effect on theconflictive and cooperative actions of dyadic interactants.Toward A New Taxonomy of Reciprocity:The AttributionReciprocity (AR) ModelThe case for reciprocity is clearly identified within the literature.However, the major schism in theliteratureexists not with thepersistence of reciprocity, but with whether one can improve theconceptual understanding of reciprocity to account for the sparse andcontextually constrained identification of incidents of reciprocity (Stern& Druckman, 2000). Moreover, the desiderata is a conceptual under-standing that will yield a taxonomy and operationalization of variablesthat will assist in revealing patterns of reciprocity. These presentlyinvisible patterns of reciprocity can be discerned in the data usingattribution theory as the basis for the taxonomy and operationalization ofkey variables. The identification of these variables iscriticaltounderstanding the patterns of reciprocity. The evidence of reciprocity inpast studies reveals modest findings due to the constraints of uni-dimensional scalesthe scales used to measure and score actions on acontinuum of conflictful commonlyfound in international relations. In general, theoccurrence of reciprocity usually takes the form of the reciprocationof either positiveor negative actions. Ofcourse, the reciprocation of positiveactions more than thereciprocation of negative actions is indicative ofcooperative behavior.Essentially, the perception of a positive actioncan affect whether the recipient of that action ultimately defines itas positive. For example,Larson's (1988) study of reciprocity insuperpower relations found that positive actionsor favors will be reciprocatedonly aftera state's evaluation of the actual and perceived value ofa response.Larson (1988)states: \"The motives perceived to underlay another state's proposals affectwhether it is viewedas a concession and shape the formulation of response\"(p. 298). Thereare many theoreticalex- planations for reciprocity.However, a majority ofthese explanations portray self-interestas a motivation for reciprocation (Macy, 1989). Moreover, the reciprocationof an actionmay determine a level of compliance and insome cases an acceptance ofa condition of threat. The attributions manifestin the actions of eithermember of a dyad requires a theory thataddresses more than thepositive or negative dimension of an actionor event. The identification of an attribution of an event or action as a threatrecognizes that the respondent and the actorare engaged in amore complex interaction.A taxonomy thatuses attribution theory provides both for the clarification of the complexity of the existing modelsof simple, trend, and comparative reciprocityand a dictate for thereanalysis of these established reciprocitymodels. Furthermore, Isuggest that existing models of reciprocityrequire a metamorphousinto new hybrid models based on the foundations ofsimple, trend, and comparative models using attribution theory. Themodest evidence for reciprocity in all modelscan be artifact ofuni-dimensional scales andtheir assorted as the Attribution Reciprocity (AR) model. The AR modelcan reveal the presently imperceptible complexity of actions ofreciprocity that the simple,trend, and comparative reciprocity modelsare based upon (i.e., the unidimensional scales used in the Conflict andPeace Data BankCOPDAB (Azar, 1982) and World Events InteractionSurveyWEIS (McClelland,1978). The current evidence of reciprocity isconceptually constrained dueto the heretofore-4 7 1 466NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY unexamined importance and recognition of the attribution process in alllevelsofdyadicinteraction:interpersonal,intergroup,interor-ganizational, and international relations. To that end, the exposition ofthe pertinent theoretical evidence and empirical research based in thereciprocity literature illuminates the pragmatic value of the AttributionReciprocity (AR) model.Interpersonal RelationsThe theoreticalcross-fertilizationof attribution and reciprocityparadigms for the purpose of the advancement of international relationsinquiry requires the integration of pertinent research on the largelyseparate traditions of attribution and reciprocity. The study of attributionon an interpersonal level (Heider, 1944, 1958; Kelley, 1972a, 1972b;Weiner, 1971, 1979) is well documented in the literature.The study of attribution in international relations is a new area ofinquiry; however, the precepts of the attribution process have a longubiquitous presence in the reciprocity literature. Historically, Gouldner's(1960) norm of reciprocity states that individuals are socialized intoexchange relations. Briefly, people should help those who help them andnot hurt those who help them (\"quid-pro-quo\").The study of attribution in interpersonal and intergroup relationsbased on Weiner (1979) suggests a causal chain and a temporal durationof the chain of events that is central to the issue of the attribution process.Reciprocity is an artifact of a more conceptually complex process andmay reveal a broader array of interaction patterns of reciprocity (simple,comparative, and trend models). However, the identification of theinteractants relevant to the attribution process may also be accomplishedby identifying their actions within Weiner's model.Weiner et al.'s (1971) expression of \"locus of causality\" offers acritical restatement and modification to the analysis of attribution ofRotter's earlier work on \"locus of control\" (Rotter, 1966). Weinerpresented (1979, 1986) a three dimensional taxonomy of causality of theattribution process. The first dimension identifies an attribution's locus asinternal or external. The second dimension identifies an attribution asstable or unstable. The third identifies an attribution as controllable oruncontrollable.The influence of prior actions of an individual and/or a group willinfluence the attribution process of an individual. Kelley's (1972a) workasserts that individual motivation for the exercising of control affects theprocess of attribution. Kelley explains that the temporal events ofcovariation between effect and response (i.e., \"law of effect\") accumulatea priori to an interaction event and serve as indicators in the attributionprocess. Sprecher (1998) maintains that patterns of reciprocal liking have INTERNATIONALRELATIONSBogumil467 a cumulative effect that influences attraction basedon the expressions of intrinsic satisfaction ofinteractants. Earlier,Kelley (1972a) suggested that the locus facilitation andinhibition toencompass the separation of effects with the association ofany one cause's locus causalityand control. attributed locus ofcausality and control basedon the power and availability of interactantsin reciprocal exchangesnetworks. They found that risk reductionwas accomplished by reciprocal interaction with individuals whowere less powerful and therefore more predictable in unilateral actions. Anderson, Guerrero, Buller, andJorgenson (1998) found that immediacy ofreciprocal actionsmay adversely the response of the interactants. Paese and Gilin (2000)assert that reciprocity interactants. Kenny, Mohr, and Levesque (2001)suggest that individuals within relationships will engage in reciprocityeven when a variance in the behaviors of partners is present. Theacts of reciprocitymay sustain a relationship through any series of crisespresent in the shared maintenance of long- term relationships.Group and OrganizationalRelationsThe role of reciprocityas a financial, social and legal bond, positions the concept of reciprocityat the center of socialorganization (Fausto, 1999). Martinko (1995),McDonald (1995) andWeiner (1995) maintain that motivation andresponse of group and organization members and intergroup and interorganizational entities can be evaluatedwithin a rational attributiontaxonomy.The cognitive traditionof Heider's (1958)work on interpersonal relations was expanded byresearch on group dynamics and individual behavior (Cartwright andZander, 1960). Zander's(1971) compendium of experimental workon group motivation and beliefs reveals that group cohesion is a function ofa synchronicity of member and group desires and goals. The maintenanceof group identity requiresmember com- petence. The member'scompetence and the group'ssuccess are critically intertwined in the perception of the member, thegroup, and the social pressure of other groupson the group (Zander, 1971,p. 200). Raven, Schwarzwald, andKoslowsky's (1998) evaluation of power in reciprocity maintains thata subordinate member ofan organization independentlymay assess the informational and expert power of a supervisor basedon the subordinate's perception of the locus of causality (external or internal) ofthe supervisor's actions.Likewise, the inference of members of in-groupsand out groups formschema and subsequently 468NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY attribute behaviors of\"the other\" group as common and salientcharacteristics 1981; Kanouse, 1972; Kelley, 1972b;Singer, 1981).This synergy of boundary and cognitiveconsistency functions sustains group identity. Attributions common togroup members have a greater impact on groups that are interdependentthan groups that are independent (Lu, 1997; Zaccaro, Peterson, &Walker, 1987). The salience of attributions made by groups within acontext of a shared symbolic environment is an artifact of the interactionsamong the groups and their environment (Lippitt, Polansky, & Rosen,1952; Shavitt & Fazio,1991). Rotter (1966) regards the internaldimensionascontingentonone's\"ownrelativelypermanentcharacteristics\" and the external dimension as \"the great complexity offorces surrounding\" the individual. The interaction and negotiation of agroup's perception of internal and the external dimensions of attributionand the other dimensions of the attribution process represents the group'svalance. The group's judgement affects their behavior. The valance ofinternal and external attribution foments group Jans, and Hopstaken (1993) found that patterns ofreciprocity were aligned with the interests of the norms and values of theorganization. They stated that subordinates shared perceptions of patternsof reciprocity. Subordinates perceptions of the reciprocity of colleagueswere expressed as balanced interactions juxtaposed to their expressionsof imbalanced reciprocal interactions with supervisors.Interorganizational RelationsMcDonald (1995) explains the attribution process as a function ofinterdependent group social identity (Bogumil, 1988; Tajfel, 1973) within anorganizational environment. The members of groups maintain theirschema by rational attribution of causality of their status. Furthermore,their status reifies their casual schema that informs their rationalattributions regarding their group, the other group, and the environment(Branscombe, Schmitt, & Harvey, 1999; Oetting, 1999; Weiner, 1998).Laumann andMarsden's(1982)studyofreciprocityininter-organizational settings found that in a highly competitive environment,autonomous organizations would act with regard to self-interest.In the case of \"autonomous organizations engaged in voluntarilycoordinated pursuit of collective goals,\" there exists an expectation ofreciprocity based on shared values (Laumann & Marsden, 1982, p. 344).Laumann and Marsden suggest these similarities in dyads serve toincrease mutuality. They illuminate an approach that emphasizes the INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Bogumil469 basisforfutureinterorganizationalstudies examining reciprocity- -namely, to employ the theory interpersonal relations to structurefurther inquires.Michener, Vaske, Schleifer, Plazewski and Chapman (1975) foundthat reciprocity between bargainers was affected by a bargainer'sconcession rate. The more powerful party in negotiation viewed a greaterfrequency of concession by the \"other\" party as the less incentive toreciprocate. Eyuboglu and Buja (1993) maintain that inter-organizationalnegotiations exhibit reciprocity in the process of contention. Theysuggest that organizations engaged in bargaining commit to patterns ofexpected knowledge of another organization and misperception of theother creates contention. However, this unbridled contention betweennegotiating parties may only serve to complicate the development of ashared basis of facts. A tactic of making a \"threat\" has no meaning whenit cannot be perceived amongst many other unintentional actions thatfoster the same perception of \"threat.\" This unintentional outcome limitsproper exploitation of the utility of contention (i.e., making a \"threat\").Cialdini (1996) and Settoon, Bennett, and Liden (1997) assert that theembedded patterns of attribution in the perception of other groups(sections, divisions, and/or departments) promotes an organizationalenvironment susceptible to influence systems that can negatively affectan organization's reciprocal relations (i.e., a corporate culture).International RelationsAttribution theory has been examined extensively at the interpersonallevel of dyadic relations. Likewise, the study of models of reciprocity hasoccurred within the domain of interpersonal relations (Downie 1996, 2001 for an extensive review).Furthermore, there is a substantial literature within the study ofinternational relations that has dealt with cooperation, conflict andreciprocity (Bogumil, 1993; Dixon, 1986; Druckman & Wyk & Radloff, 1993).There is modest evidence that national leaders generally reciprocatethe actions of others under various conditions (Bogumil, 1993; Holsti &Rosenau,1988;Patchen,1988:262-263).Thistendency towardreciprocity in international relations has been empirically found ininteractions between the USSR and the US (Dixon, 1986; Druckman &Harris, 1990; Freeman & Goldstein, 1989; Goldstein 470NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL 1986).The study of the attribution as integral to the process of reciprocity isa relatively unexamined area of inquiry. Dyadic relationships have beenevaluatedusingeitherattributionorreciprocity/socialexchangetheoretical perspectives from the interpersonal to the international levelsof analysis. The nation state provides a change in scale; however, thedynamics are grounded in the international relations (IR) literature andare fundamental to process of reciprocity in the IR literature (Braver,1975; Bremer, 1992; Larson, 1998; Leng, 1998; Patchen, 1998; Stern 2000). The inferences of international actors (nation states)form schema and subsequently they relationship between boundary maintenance of a nation-statesprojected identity in international relations requires cognitive consistencyin their international policy. The synergy of the maintenance of stabilityin their policy and the functions of leadership in the implementation ofthat policy can result in the bureaucratic momentum of group identity(Brady & Kegley, 1977; Dixon, 1986). Janis (1989) identified thispotentially deleterious \"mindguarding\" process as one basis for theprocess of Groupthink. One may understand this as volatile state of thepresence of inertia in decision models.Reciprocity research subsumes collective identity and leadershipaction as tandem and coupled elements in the international interactionprocess (Brewer, 1985; Brewer & Schneider, presence of international organizations can fosterattributions common to nation state group members and may have agreater impact on groups that are interdependent than groups that areindependent (Cusack Widamaier,1982; Zaccaro, Peterson, & Walker, 1987). Many factors may affect theoccurrence of reciprocity between nations. These factors include culturaldifferences (Hwang, 1987), differences in the values related to humanrights (Van Wyk & Radloff, 1993), economic strength or unequal power(Leng, 1993; Patchen, 1988), domestic policy beliefs about foreign7 6' INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Bogumil471 policy initiatives (Holsti & negotiatorcommunication styles(Druckman, Broome & Korper, 1988) andelections cycles (Gaubatz, 1991). The reciprocal response of a nation hasbeen attributed to a golden rule of international politics set forth by Ward(1981). Ward's modified golden rule's basic premise is \"to do unto othersas they have recently done unto you.\" Simply stated, the reciprocation ofa past action of another finds modest support in a wide variety ofanalyses (Bogumil, Stern and Druckman (2000) haveidentified the systemic nature of reciprocity research based in existingconceptualizations of the actions of international actors or nation states.The application of Weiner's model of attribution theorytothereconceptualization of reciprocity research in international relations canprovide important innovation to the study of international relations.The AR Model: Transition to an Attribution TaxonomyResearch using the Attribution Reciprocity (AR) model stipulates arequired articulation of the manner of implementation or transition to theAR model. The transition to the AR model can be accomplished byrecoding the existing narratives using the attribution taxonomy. Forexample, the AR model's coding scheme would require transformation ofan attitude object (i.e., the narrative statement) to be evaluated in terms ofthe three dimensions. The attitude object (i.e., the narrative statement)would receive a value on the following dimensions: internal or external,stable or unstable, and controllable or uncontrollable. The coding of theactions relative to the states of attribution and the positive or negativevalence of the action will permit a more precise analysis of patterns ofreciprocity. The coding process would necessitate a research protocolthat included an evaluation of the validity and reliability of thejudges/coders.A recoding of existing scale values (Azar, 1980; Azar & Calhoun, 1971; Vincent, 1983) is That process mayundermine the capturing of the \"true\" multidimensional nature of anaction/event.For example, an attempt to employ that type of codingscheme would require transformation of an attitude object word such as\"threat\" to be evaluated in terms of the three attribution state dimensions.The expression \"threat\" would receive a value on the followingdimensions: internal or external, stable or unstable, and controllable oruncontrollable. The transformation of single descriptor without thecontext of descriptors into a three dimensional expression of attributionstates raises issues of validity.The Attribution Reciprocity (AR) model's expressedas dichotomous variablesmutually attribution states (e.g., 472NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY internalorexternal,stableorunstable,andcontrollableoruncontrollable). However, one may extend these dichotomous di-mensional characteristics of attribution to expressions of continuousdimensions of attribution states (Weiner, 1986). This suggestion wouldbe similar in method to Bales (1979) SYstem for Multiple LevelObservation of Groups (SYMLOG)a three-dimensional cube designwith spatial characteristics of proximity of personality. The meth-odological extension beyond the dichotomous categories has implicationsfor the present theoretical dimensionality of the AR model. Moreover,these two intertwined aspects of method and theory intersect in apotentially precarious and problematic manner.The following is a proposed and limited AR model treatment of therecent case of US relations with China. The scope of this paper is thetheoretical development of the AR model for the study of reciprocity ininternational relations. This paper is not an empirical examination thatmandates rigorous statistical analyses of event coding procedures andevent patterns of reciprocity. Therefore, this example of the AR modelmust be evaluated in a circumspect fashion given they lack the empiricalevaluation of the cumulative reciprocal events. The empirical evaluationof eventsisimperativeas context for understanding the dyadicinteractions of nation-states. The absence of a context based on anempirical examination can only be replaced with an anecdotal historicalcontext. Furthermore, this exposition of the principles of the AR modelserves to merely identify the attribution states of the nation-states. Theinference of patterns of reciprocity: simple, trend, or comparative areauthentic and conclusive, subject to empirical analysis (Bogumil, 1993).The following events represent provide an account of the recent caseof the Chinese government's interception and forced landing of a USreconnaissance plane. This example's purpose is to present an ident-ification of the attribution states proposed in the AR model. This exampleidentifies the attribution states of the US and China dyad during thisepisode. The AR model presentation in this example identifies thedichotomous categories of attribution states: external or internal, stable orunstable, and controllable or uncontrollable. The reciprocity and theattribution states identified and assigned to the actions of the US andChina must be understood in their historical context.US-China episode: A US Navy EP-3 surveillance aircraft with a twenty-four member crew collided with a Chinese fighter on April 1, 2001.Near China's coastline a US Reconnaissance plane encounters a Chinesefighter shadowing the US plane.

At this stage, both China and the US arereciprocating action across attribution states in preparation for the MFNagreement. These discernable attribution state patterns of reciprocity aresimilar to periodicity waves. The suggestion of simple reciprocity can beinferred by the reciprocation of stability in attribution states. However,there are multiple AR models operating simultaneously and they enrichthe context and must be brought into account. There are many examplesof multiple wave manifestation of the AR model in US-China relations inthe presence of various international events. One is the allied efforts ofthe US and China during World War II in the Pacific theater (e.g., theFlying Tigersa covert private/public enterprise).The identification of a wave or the intersection of waves in patternsof reciprocity using the AR model is a rigorous process. The review ofonly a few of the events in a wave reveals the level of complexity of suchan analysis. Moreover, the demands of relevant context would alsorequire the evaluation of ongoing policies regarding China's MostFavored Nation (MFN) status, China human rights violations (i.e.,religious groups, quasi-religious movements and activistsFalun Gongand dissonant scholars) and the status of Tibet.ConclusionThe future of reciprocity and attribution research can benefit from theAttribution Reciprocity (AR) model's inclusion and identification of theattribution states that previous scholarship had subsumed on a continuumof conflict and cooperation. Furthermore, the comparative evaluation ofprevious research findings on reciprocity and attribution will increase ourunderstanding of widely identified patterns of reciprocity within thesimple, trend, and comparative of these previously studied patterns of reciprocity maybe more fully realized in future research with the implementation of theAttribution Reciprocity (AR) model. Attribution theory provides aunique opportunity to bring clarification to fundamental theoretical,methodological,andconceptualissuesconfrontingthestudyofreciprocity.The extensionof theapplicationof theAttributionReciprocity (AR) model to the remaining levels of dyadic interaction:interpersonal, intergroup, and interorganizational relations will permit anevaluation of the efficacy of the AR model.

Craig WallaceGeorgia Institute of TechnologySteven J. Kass & Claudia StannyUniversity of West FloridaThis study examined the predictive ability of the Cognitive FailuresQuestionnaire (CFQ) on one's likelihood of responding incorrectly totarget and non-target stimuli on a sustained attention task. The SustainedAttention to Response Task (SART) is a go/nogo task in which the 'go'aspect of the task requires a response by the participant and the `nogo*aspect of the task requires participants to inhibit a response. A sample of151 participants completed the CFQ and the SART. Results indicated thatone of the CFQ factors, namely Memory, possesses the ability to predictperformance for the 'go' aspect of the SART. However, none of the CFQfactors could predict performance for the `nogo' aspect of the task.Possible applications for the CFQ and SART are discussed, as well asideas for future research.Research on sustained attention and vigilance dates back to 1948when Mackworth first measured sustained attention using a sample ofNavy radar operators. Robertson, Manly, Andrade, Baddeley, and Yiend(1997) defined sustained attention as \"the ability to self-sustain mindful,conscious processing of stimuli whose repetitive, non-arousing qualitieswould otherwise lead to habituation and distraction to other stimuli\" (p.747). Mackworth (1948) and a host of other &Quilter,1989; Kass, Vodanovich, Stanny, & Taylor, 2001; Hawkins, 1999) have examined sustainedattention over theyears and found several relationships betweenperformance on sustained attention tasks and a variety of constructs.Some of the more common personality traits found to be associated withsustained attention are boredom, worry, and poor attentional levels(Robertson et al., 1997).Factors such as those listed above have implications for performanceon a variety of on-the-job tasks and create a need to predict ability toAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: J. Craig Wallace, School ofPsychology, 274 5th Street, Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta, GA 30332-0170: E-mail: CraieWallacc@mediaone.netNorth American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3, No. 3, 481-490.NAJP487 482NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY sustain attention. Sustained attention is required for a variety of situationsincluding radar/sonar monitoring, industrialinspection, and vehicleoperation (Jerison, 1977). These situations commonly involve monot-onous work, multi-tasking, and high stress. For example, air traffic con-trollers monitor a radar screen for hours and are responsible for the safedelivery of the airplane's passengers. Decrements in sustained attentionmay result in adverse effects (e.g., plane crash). If an individual's abilityto sustain attention could be assessed, the potential for adverse effectsmight be reduced through appropriate employee selection, placement,and training.All individuals, at one time or another, may forget to do somethingthat they are reasonably familiar with, such as forgetting a recentlyintroduced name or throwing away something that they meant to keep.Absentminded people tend \"to be inattentive to ongoing activity, to losetrack of current aims and to become distracted from intended thought oraction by salient but (currently) irrelevant stimuli\" (Manly et al., 1999, p.661). Absentminded actions, or rather cognitive failures, are cognitivelybased mistakes or errors on a task that a person should normally becapable of successfully completing (Martin, 1983). Robertson et al.(1997) stated that it is likely that ability to sustain attention plays acrucial role in an individual's tendency to experience cognitive failure.Reason (1974) was a pioneer in the area of cognitive failure, andmuch of the interest in the area originated with his work. For example, hestudied the navigational errors of pilots who plotted flight plans by thewrong end of the compass needle. Norman (1980) also examined cog-nitive failures, but referred to them as slips and defined them as \"theperformance of an action that was not what was intended\" (p. 71).Norman (1980) went on to state that there are three major categories ofslips: errors in the formation of the intention, faulty activation ofschemas, and false triggering. Cognitive failures, or slips, have beenshown to relate to such factors as short-term memory capacity, attentionand vigilancelevel,incidentallearning,anddistributedattention(Broadbent, Cooper, Chappelow, & Belyavin, 1995) hascontinued to examine cognitive failure. Smith et al. (1995) examinedfocused attention, categoric search, and cognitive failure. They foundevidence that supported earlier findings (e.g., Broadbent et al., 1982),namely that cognitive failureis negatively correlated with speed incategoric search(i.e.,those participants more likely to experiencecognitive failures took longer to identify the target in the search).Houston (1989) found that self-focused attention might be one of the Wallace. Kass & StannyPREDICTING PERFORMANCE 483 underlying factors responsible for cognitive failure in that the attentionpaid to one's behavior may reduce the attentional level that is required byother tasks.Larson etal.(1997) found that cognitive failure waspositively correlated with on-the-job accidents in a military setting, aswell as automobile accidents (Larson & Merritt. 1991).Robertson, et al. (1997) and Manly, et al. (1999) found that totalcognitivefailurescoresmeasuredviatheCognitiveFailuresQuestionnaire (CFQ) were negatively related with performance on asustained attention task, specifically the number of errors in responseinhibition on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) (r = -.27). In other words, participants scoring high on the CFQ failed toinhibit responses on the SART when required to do so. The SART is ago/nogo task that requires a person to respond to all non-targets andwithhold a response for the target stimulus. The SART attempts tomeasure sustained attention over a short period of time (i.e., 4.5 minutes),whereas other measures of sustained attention such as the MackworthClock require much more time to administer (e.g., 45 minutes). Errors ofcommission on a go/nogo task are the laboratory analog of everyday slipsof action due to false triggering. While previous research examining thistopic (i.e., Manly, et al., 1999; Robertson, et al., 1997) has found asignificant negative correlation, the relationship between the factorstructure of the CFQ and SART performance has not been examined.The examples of cognitive failure discussed above can occur forseveral reasons. A cognitive failure can occur when an action is triggeredinappropriately, such as turning a switch on instead of off duringemergency procedures. Alternatively, a plan of thought or action may besidetracked by intervening stimuli, such as forgetting to take the trash outafter receiving a telephone call, or targeting the wrong item, such asusing flour instead of sugar in one's coffee (Manly, et al., 1999).The purpose of the present study was to examine whether aninstrument designed to assess one's cognitive failure susceptibility couldpredict actual number of errors on a task requiring sustained attention.Previous research has examined the relationship between total CFQscores and SART performance (e.g., Robertson, et al., 1997). However,research has not been conducted examining the relationship, or lackthereof, between the newly identified factor structure of the CFQ (seeWallace, Kass, & Stanny, 2001) and SART performance. Additionally,previous research has not utilized the 'go' aspect of the task as aperformance measure. To date, only the `nogo' aspect of the SART hasbeen used as a performance measure. Lastly, previous studies examiningthis relationship have done so using a clinical sample that was relativelysmall. The current study used a much larger sample and consisted ofyoung adults. Based on previous findings, it was hypothesized that CFQ 484NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY subscale scores would be significant predictors of SART 'go' and `nogo'performance.METHODParticipantsA sample of 151 university students participated in the present study.Participants were psychology students at a small university in the South.Participation was voluntary and the participants were anonymous. Thesample was comprised of 45 males and 106 females. The average age ofthe participants was 21.7 years (SD = 5.5). The ethnic breakdown of thesample yielded the following percentages: 77.5 % Caucasian, 11.5%African American, 5% Hispanic American, 4% Asian American, and 2%other or not reported.MaterialsThe Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (Broadbent et al., 1982) is a25-item self-report inventory that contains questions regarding failures inmemory, perception, and motor function over the past 6 months. Allquestions are worded in the same direction. The response format utilizesa 5-point Likert scale (0=never, 4=always) with possible total scoresranging from 0 to 100. High scores on the CFQ suggest that the person isprone to committing cognitively based mistakes such as throwing away abook of unused matches and retaining the used match or forgetting whatone came to the store to purchase (Broadbent et al., 1982). Test-retestreliability was found to be .82 over a 2-month time interval (Vom Hofe,Mainemarre, & Vannier, 1998), and internal consistency was good (alpha= .89) for the current version (Vom Hofe et al., 1998).Four interpretable factors for the CFQ were identified by Wallace andhis colleagues (2001). These were Memory, Distractibility, Blunders, andNames. The Memory factor consists of items that are consistent withmemory failures and forgetfulness, while Distractibility pertains toperceptual aspects of attentional tasks (e.g., Do you read something andfind you haven't been thinking about it and must read it again?). TheBlunders factor relates to physical mishaps and the Names factorcontains items that relate to memory for people's names. Subscale scoressuggest that a person who scores high on a particular subscale might bemore prone to commit a cognitive failure with regard to that particularsubscale, than a person who scores lower on that subscale. For example,a person scoring high on the Memory subscale might be more susceptibleto forgetting than a person who scores lower on the Memory subscale.The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) (Robertson et al.,1997) is a go/nogo task in which 225 single digit numbers, 25 of eachdigit (1-9), are visually presented via computer over a 4.3-minute time490 Wallace. Kass & StannyPREDICTING PERFORMANCE 485 span. Each digit is displayed for 250 milliseconds, after which a maskingstimulus is presented for 900 msec. to prevent the target from remainingvisible due to the time required for phosphor decay. The onset-to-onsetinterval between stimuli is 1,150 msec. The mask for the SART is an \"X\"encompassed in a 29mm circle. The mask and all digits were presented inwhite against a black background. The SART task was presented onPentium based 133 MHz PC computers via DOS running ExperimentalRun Time System (Beringer, 1996). All monitors used were color(SVGA) and the viewing area measured 14 inches (diagonally). Norestrictions were placed on the movement of the participants during thetask.A go/nogo task requires response inhibition by the participant. Inother words, when a target appears (e.g., a specified letter or number) theparticipant should not respond. Additionally, when non-targets appear theparticipant should respond. The task allows for two types of measures:response, measured by the 'go'aspect of thetask, and responseinhibition, measured by the `nogo' aspect. Participants scoring high onthe 'go' measure of the SART fail to respond to necessary stimuli.Participants scoring high on the `nogo' aspect of the SART fail to inhibita response when required to do so on the task.All participants were required to press a key on a keyboard inresponse to all digits except the number 3. All 225 digits (5 repetitions ofeach digit x 9 digits x 5 font sizes) were presented in random order in asingle session. The font size for each digit was randomly selected fromfont sizes of 48, 72, 94, 100, and 120 points. This was done to offset anyeffects that may have arisen from searching for a peripheral feature of thetarget digit. Font sizes equate to a height ranging from 12mm to 29mm.The design of the task is consistent with that of Manly, et al. (1999) andRobertson, et al. (1997). Reaction time and false alarms were recorded.All participants were encouraged to give equal value to precision andrapidity while completing the test. Practice sessions of 18 digits, in-cluding 2 target digits, preceded all data recording sessions. This wasdone to familiarize the participants with the task and reduce errors due totask novelty. Robertson, et al. (1997) have shown that the SART isreliable over a 1-week period (r = .76).ProcedureAfter consenting to participate, participants completed the CFQ andthe SART. All participants completed the CFQ first and the SARTsecond. This procedure was undertaken as it was the desire of theresearchers to examine the predictive ability of the CFQ and its factorson SART performance. Participants were then debriefed about the studyafter completing the SART. 486NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY RESULTSThe results of the present study differ from previous findings (e.g.,Robertson et al., 1997). However, new insight has been gleaned for thepredictive ability of the CFQ (see Table 1for means and standarddeviations). TABLE 1 Means and Standard Deviations of Cognitive Failures andSART ErrorsMeasure MSDCFQ SART = SustainedAttention to Response Task. For the 'go' aspect of the task no significant relationship betweentotal CFQ scores and SART performance was observed [F (1.149) =1.59, p= .19]. However, further investigation of the predictive ability of theCFQ factors demonstrated a single significant relationship: the CFQMemory factor was a significant predictor of 'go' performance (R = .24, p< .05) and accounted for roughly 6% of the variance in SART 'go'performance scores. In other words, this factor was able to predict SARTperformance for omission errors when a response was required. No otherCFQ factors were significant predictors of SART 'go' performance (seeTable 2).For the `nogo' aspect of the task no significant relationship wasidentified between total CFQ scores and SART performance [F (1. 149)=.01, p = .89]. Additionally, no individual factors were significant pre-dictors of SART `nogo' performance (see Table 2).DISCUSSIONThe results of the present study question the predictive ability of theCFQ for response inhibition performance measures. However, the CFQMemory factor was related to SART 'go' performance. This suggests that Wallace, Kass & StannyPREDICTING PERFORMANCE 487 individuals who score high on the CFQ Memory subscale might be lesslikely to respond to a stimulus that necessitates a response. This findingisquiteinteresting becauseitappearsthatindividuals who canadequately inhibit a response when required (measured by the `nogo'aspect of the SART) may be less prone to respond when a response iswarranted (measured by the 'go' aspect of the SART). For example, apolice officer may correctly identify a harmless stimulus and not respond,but fail to respond to a threatening stimulus. This could jeopardize thesafety of the officer and others if a situation like this was encountered.Future research might examine the importance of a person's decision andhis or her willingness to accept a false alarm and its consequences. TABLE 2 Prediction of CFQ Cognitive Failures Questionnaire. SART = Sustainedto Response Task. The current study failed to support the hypothesis that CFQ scoreswould predict `nogo' performance on the SART. The findings are in-consistent with other researchers' findings (e.g., Robertson et al., 1997, &Manly et al., 1999) that examined the predictive ability of the CFQ onSART performance (i.e., nogo performance). While the current studyfailed to produce similar findings, there are numerous possibilities thatcould help explain previous findings. For example, the sample that wasused in the study by Robertson, et al. (1997) only contained 75participants and the current study used a much larger sample (N = 151) inwhich no relationship was identified.One limitation of the study may be found in the task itself. It ispossible that the SART and other measures of attention (e.g., MackworthClock) assess different attributes of attention (i.e., attention for vigilancetask vs. attention for go/nogo task), and should be used as part of abattery of tests to identify individuals with a propensity for committing 488NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY cognitive failures. Another limitation may be that subjects respondedquickly to all SART stimuli. In other words, the participants traded offaccuracy for increased speed. Perhaps directions that emphasize accuracyover speed might have been able to overcome this problem. Or possibly,participants lacked the level of motivation for completing the taskappropriately and some form of motivation might have been used (e.g., amonetary reward) in an effort to encourage participants to do their bestby placing more importance on the decision to respond.Future research should examine the CFQ in light of a differentsustained attention task (e.g., Mackworth Clock) in order to examine thepredictive ability of the CFQ on other types of sustained attention tasks(e.g., vigilance tasks). Additionally, a computer simulation that targets amore specific environment (e.g., production line, police shooting exer-cise) could be used as a task that more accurately represents anenvironment where a person will be required to complete a sustainedattentiontask. A more realistictask might influenceparticipants'decision-making by placing more importance on the task and possibleoutcomes of the task (e.g., a simulated power-plant meltdown). This mayallow researchers and practitioners alike to identify the best-suitedcandidate for the position that the simulation portrays (e.g., air trafficcontroller, police officer).Additionally, a more balanced and representative sample of the de-sired population (e.g., air traffic controllers) might be more generalizableto a particular population rather the university student.Overall, the CFQ shows limited potential as a tool that could be usedas part of a battery of tasks and tests to assess an individual's ability torespond to stimuli. However, before such a battery can be utilized abetter understanding of sustained attention, cognitive failures, and otherrelated constructs is necessary. It is the hope of the authors that futureresearch will be able to provide a more thorough understanding ofsustained attention and its relationship to cognitive failures. 494 Wallace.

Manuscript under review.45 The Development of an Attitudes Towards theSense of Smell Questionnaire (SoSQ) and aComparison accounts emphasise the importanceof the sense of smell to humans, but no study has systematicallyexamined people's attitudes and beliefs about the olfactory sense. AnAttitudes Towards the Sense of Smell Questionnaire was constructed tomeasure people's beliefs concerning the sense of smell, its importanceand its uses. It was administered to 105 participants from occupations inwhich odour is considered important to varying degrees (17 bakers, 19florists, 17 chefs, 52 controls). Respondents made self-ratings of theirolfactory sensitivity and efficiency, their ability to detect and their abilityto identify odour. Principal components analysis produced a four factorsolution. These factors were: Liking for People, Places and ObjectsAssociated with Odour, Emotional Responses to Odour, Dispensibility ofOdour and the Uses and Efficacy of Odour. Each occupation's responseon the sensitivity, efficiency, ability to detect and ability to identify odourmeasures and for each factor was analysed by a 4 (group) x 2 (sex) x 2(age) independent groups ANOVA. Older florists rated their sense ofsmell as being more efficient than did younger florists and chefs ratedtheir ability to identify smells as significantly better than that of floristsand controls. No significant main effect of group was found for anyfactor but a significant sex x group interaction was observed for theEmotional Responses to Odour factor: women in the control groupregarded sense of smell as being capable of generating greater emotionthan did men. Possible clinical applications are suggested.Popular journalism and the writings of some of our more celebratedliterary artists eulogise the capacity of our sense of smell to evokeprofound emotions and thoughts. Kipling, for example, famously re-marked that smells were surer than sounds or sights to make your heartstrings crack, and a myriad poets and novelists such as Suskind (inPerfume), Joyce (in Portrait of An Artist), Baudelaire (in The Perfume),Sheckley (in the Alchemical Marriage of Alistair Crompton) and ProustAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Neil Martin, School of SocialScience. Middlesex University, LondonEN3 4SF. England. U.K.North American Journal of Psychology, 2001, Vol. 3. No. 3, 491-502.NAJP 492NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY (in A Recherche du Temps Perdu) have alluded to the ability of smell toevoke powerful emotions and generate memories from the distant past.Newspaper and magazine articles consistently highlight the powers ofsmell to engage our thinking and to alter our mood (e.g., Hope, 1996;Cripps, 1998).Yet, the sense of smell seems to occupy a relatively inconsequentialplace in everyday life when compared to other senses. People aregenerally very poor at identifying even very familiar odours and theyroutinely regard the sense of smell as being of lesser importance thanother senses (Engen, 1987). It is this view of olfaction that has led to itsbeing viewed as the Cinderella of the Senses. We are aware that it playsan important role in the perception of food flavour (although its role isunderestimated), and we enjoy products that are scented -even ratingthem as being of better quality than unscented items (Spangenberg,Crowley & Henderson, 1996).Empirical research, however, has established that exposure to ambientor more directly presented odours can have significant, positive andnegative effects on human behaviour (Martin, 1999). The presence of apleasant scent has been found to: increase helping behaviour (Baron,1997); improve anagram formation (Baron & Thomley, 1994); decreasebrain activity associated with attention (Martin, 1998); create a morepositive impression of a casually-dressed female job interviewee butcreate a more negative impression of a well-dressed woman (Baron,1983); increase or decrease visual vigilance (Gould & Martin, 2001;Warm, Dember,& Parasuraman, 1991); improve performance ondifficult tasks (Martin, 2001); impair mental arithmeticperformance (Ludvigson & Rottman, 1989); temporarily enhance feelingsof good health (Martin, 1996); and enhance recall when the odour ispresent at learning and retrieval (Herz, 1997). Exposure to unpleasantscents has typically negative consequences, including the impairment ofmood and cognitive task performance (Rotton, 1983; Schiffman, Sattely-Miler, Suggs, & Graham, 1995).Research also suggests that odours are capable of generating moreemotional memories than are words or sights (Herz & Cupchik, 1992;1995) and are effective at prompting memories of events experiencedyears previously (Aggleton & Waskett, 1999; Chu & Downes, 2000).These two lines of research one indicating that exposure to ambientodour can alter behaviour significantly in unpredictable ways, the otherindicating that we do not hold the sense of smell in high regard - suggestthat our attitudes toward, and our lay knowledge of the use andconsequences of smell are areas that researchers may productivelyexplore. The study of people's attitudes towards odour, its uses and its97 Martin. Apena, Chaudry. Mulligan & Nixon Sense of Smell493 perceived importance may reveal (i) how this sense is generally viewedand (ii) how or if people's views are consistent with the olfactorypsychology literature.No study to date has systematically examined people's beliefs aboutand attitudes towards the sense of smell, although there have beenattempts at surveying people's responses to various aspects of smell.Wrzesniewski, McCauley and Rozin (1999), for example, undertook avalidity study of an Affective Impact of Odour scale for liking of places,people and objects. As part of this study 116 American and 336 FlemishBelgian students responded to items such as \"When you like new food, isit partly because you like the smell?\" They found that people wereinclinedtorespondpositivelytosuchquestions,indicatingthatrespondents sometimes -rather than often- liked new places, people,cosmetic products, and so on because of their odours. Although aquestionnaire-based study, the authors did not report any factor analysisof the questionnaire items.Wrzesniewski et al.'s (1999) results were more modest than thosereported by a survey undertaken by the Olfactory Research Fund (ORF,1997). Its website survey asked visitors a number of questions regardingthe importance of smell to people's everyday lives (such as howimportant the sense of smell was to daily relationships with importantothers; which emotions and behaviours were capable of being affected bysmell). Eighty per cent of their respondents (overall N>350) reportedusing environmental fragrances, 68% of those who used fragrances saidthey did so to make themselves feel better and 56% responded that theyused scents to enhance their well-being. The sense of smell wasconsidered more important for daily relationships with the opposite sexand spouse than with family, friends or co-workers. Love was the emotionregarded as being most affected by the sense of smell (anger wasregarded as being the least affected).The National Geographic Smell Survey undertaken in 1986 (Gibbons,1986) and reported in 1997 (Gilbert & Wysocki, 1997) also examinedpeople's responses to smell, concluding that the stronger the odour, themore likely it was to generate an emotional memory.Although the ORF report was a survey website report with nostatistical analysis, these data indicate that people hold positive andstereotypical views of the uses of the sense of smell. Both this and thedata from Wrzesniewski et al. (1999) studies highlight areas in whichpeople regard the sense of smell as being important. Other areas,however, such as the use of smell in food, retail and health were notexamined in any depth and both studies employed different measures andexamined different areas of olfaction.498 494NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The present study was designed to explore attitudes and beliefs aboutthe sense of smell systematically and comprehensively. We constructed aquestionnaire to examine people's responses to statements regarding theimportance of smell, the use of smell and the effect of smell on behaviour(from attraction and health, to marketing and thinking). Additionally, theresponses of various olfactory-related professions to the measure werealso investigated. Individuals with a professional interest in smell such aswine-tasters have been shown to be better identifiers and discriminatorsof odour than are untrained individuals who do not routinely use theirsense of smell in their work (Bende & Nordin, 1997). Expert wine tastersare also likely to use more analytic rather than holistic descriptors ofsmell than are novices (Chollet & Valentin, 2000). Similarly, chefs havebeen found to be relatively successful identifiers and discriminators ofvarious smells, although the data for chefs are variable (Hirsch, 1990).The present study, therefore, compared the responses of individuals fromprofessions which regularly rely on the sense of smell -bakers, chefs andfloristson the factors extracted from the SoSQ questionnaire as well asother self-report measures. Two variables known to influence olfactoryperception are age and sex (cf. Doty & Kobal, 1995) and these were alsoincluded as variables in the present study. It was predicted that a groupthat routinely uses the sense of smell in their work specifically, chefs-would express a more positive attitude toward the sense of smell thanwould participants whose occupations are not related to olfaction orparticipants whose occupations wereolfaction-related,but notasdependent on the sense of smell.METHODParticipantsOne hundred and ten persons participated in the study. Of this sample,17 were bakers, 19 were florists, 17 were chefs, three were herbalists, twowere wine tasters and 52 belonged to other non-olfactory/gustatoryprofessions. The herbalists and wine tasters were removed from infer-ential analysis because of small group sizes. Of the remaining 105 par-ticipants, 51 were men, 54 were women. The mean age was 29.5 years(SD= 5.24).Procedure and materialsQuestionnaireConstruction.Based on statements reported byWrzesriewski et al. (1999), the Olfactory Research Fund's website survey(OFC, 1997) and the ideas and thoughts generated in semi-structuredinterviews with a pilot group of six members of the general public, itemswere generated which formed the basis of an Attitudes Towards the Sense4:39 Martin. Apena, Chaudry, Mulligan & Nixon Sense of Smell495 of Smell Questionnaire (SoSQ). These thoughts and ideas focused on fourthemes: the perceived importance of the sense of smell, the role ofolfaction in health, its use in everyday life and its ability to alter emotionand thinking. Forty six statements were collated and read for sense andaccuracy by four independent raters. Any nonsensical or inaccuratelypresented statements were revised or corrected.The questionnaire took the form of statements with which respondentsagreed or disagreed on a 7-point scale, where '1' indicated strongdisagreement and '7'indicated strong agreement. Examples of suchstatements include, 'When I like a new place, it is partly because I like itsodour', 'I am more likely to spend more time in a shop if it has a pleasantsmell', 'Some smells can increase feelings of well-being' and so on.In addition to these statements, the questionnaire also requestedinformation concerning the respondents age, sex and occupation andasked respondents to rate (on 7-point scales) their sense of smell alongvarious dimensions. They were asked how sensitive their sense of smellwas (` 1 ' = not at all sensitive; '7'= very sensitive), how efficient it was= not at all efficient; '7' = very efficient), how well they were able todetect odour (1' = not at all effective at detecting odour; '7' = veryeffective at detecting odour), and how well they were able to identifyodour (`1' = cannot identify odours very well; '7' = can identify odoursvery well). The purpose of these self-reports was to measure howparticipants regarded their olfactory function (i.e., their beliefs about theirolfactory ability) rather than to determine their olfactory function per se.Questionnaire distribution.The questionnaire was administered togroups thought to use their sense of smell routinely in their work(cooking, baking, selling flowers) and for whom the sense of smell maybe important. The questionnaire was also administered to a controlsample who did not routinely use the sense of smell or taste in their work.Participants were recruited either on campus at a London university or viacontact with employers of chefs, bakers and florists in the North Londonarea.RESULTSStatistical analysis of the data was undertaken in two stages. The firstwas an exploratory factor analysis to determine the factor structure of thequestionnaire.Given thenatureand theme of theitemsinthequestionnaire, a distinct factor structure was predicted and these includedfactors related to liking for odours, the use of odour and the importanceof odour. A reliability analysis was also undertaken to omit unreliableitems. The second stage involved an inferential analysis of groupdifferences for each factor extracted.5 0 496NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY A principal components VARIMAX factor analysis produced a fourfactor solution, explaining 45.9% of total variance.

Aninitial analysis of the groups' ability to identify and detect smell, theirratings of their sense of smell's efficiency and sensitivity was undertakenin a 4 (group) x 2 (sex) x 2 (age) independent groups ANOVA. Groupswere: baker, chef, florist, control. Each group was divided into those overthirty and those under thirty. Four, three-way ANOVAs were conducted,one for each dependent variable (sensitivity,efficiency,detection,identification).Table 2 shows the overall mean responses (and standard deviations)of each group. These descriptive statistics seem to indicate that the chefs,more than the other groups, rated their sense of smell more highly and asbeing more effective and sensitive.Analysis of the sensitivity and detection data indicted no significantmain effect nor any significant interactions. However, analysis of theefficiency rating produced no main effect but an interaction between ageand group [F (3, 87) =2.72, p< .05]. Tests of simple effects showed thatthis interaction was attributable to the florists (p< .05). Older floristsrated their sense of smell as being more efficient than did the youngerflorists.Analysis of the identification data showed a significant maineffect of group [F (3. 89) = 4.83, p <.05).

A principal components analysis pro-duced a four-factor solution explaining 45% of the overall variance. Theitems suggested a clear factor structure, and reflect Liking for People,Places and Objects associated with Odour (LFO), Emotional Response toOdour (ERO), Dispensibility of the Sense of Smell (DSS) and the Usesand Efficacy of Odour (UEOO).It is interesting to note that for three of the factors (LFO, ERO andUEOO), respondents were positively disposed towards the sense of smell.503 Martin, Apena, Chaudry, Mulligan & Nixon Sense of Smell499 All of the groups (men, women; bakers, chefs, florists, controls) onaverage agreed that odours could enhance liking for items/places/peopleassociated with them, that odours were capable of evoking emotion inspecificcontexts, and that odours can be used to change variousbehaviours. However, when asked whether they would be more willingto relinquish their sense of smell than any of the other senses, a differentpattern emerged, with all groups, on average, indicating that they wouldrather lose their sense of smell than their ability to see or hear (but nottouch). This highlights an interesting feature regarding people's attitudesto smell: it is regarded positively and as being effective in changingbehaviour but it is not considered to be more important than the othermajor senses.Supporting the validity of a sub-scale published in an earlier study,the items in the LFO scale correspond closely to Wrzesriewski et al.'s(1999) Affective Impact of Odour. In fact, the LFO scale includes allitems contained in Wrzesriewski et al.'s (1999) subscale. The rationalefor expanding the number of items included in the questionnaire appearsto be validated, however, by the inclusion of eight other items that alsoappear to be measuring liking for things, people and places. The resultsprovide support for a general factor that represents people's liking forodour and items, people and places associated with them.When group differences were analysed, few differences emerged forany Factor. This was unexpected given the evidence indicating thatspecific professionals who use odour in their work are better at detectingand identifying odours than are non-users (Bende & Nordin, 1997;Chollet & Valentin, 2000). Perhaps these Factors are not related to suchdistinctions, given that responses to the subjective rating measures(sensitivity and ability to identify) showed distinct group differences.Although the ability to detect and discriminate between odours typicallydeclines with age (see Doty & Kobal, 1995), older florists rated theirsense of smell to be more efficient compared with that of younger florists.Given the absence of a main effect of age, perhaps this finding is typicalof the current group only. However, a plausible explanation for thisfinding is that the older florists, having accrued more experience in theirprofession, regard this experience as having enhanced their olfactoryefficiency. The other group difference concerned chefs' ratings of theirability to identify odours: this was significantly higher than that of floristsand controls (but not bakers), possibly because the identification of smellis crucial to their professional success.While no significant main effect of group was found for any Factor,there was a significant interaction between sex and group. Women in thecontrol group were significantly more likely find odours emotionally504- 500NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY provocative than were men. Evidence suggests that women are moresensitive to changes in odour concentration and are better at identifyingodours than are men (Doty, Appelbaum, Zusho. & Settle, 1985; Doty,1991). The sex difference observed for the controls seems to supportother,controversialevidence showingthat women respond moreemotionallytosmells than do men and that smells evoke moreemotionally-hued memories in women (Herz & Cupchik, 1992).Future research may use this new measure of attitudes toward thesense of smell to address more specific, research questions such aswhethercross-culturaldifferences,agedifferencesandclinicaldifferences exist in people's attitudes to the olfactory sense. Another,more practical application of the measure may exist in clinical settings.The measure may usefully characterise the responses of those individualswith chemical sensitivity, for example, or those who have completely orpartially lost their sense of smell. This is especially important given thatthe present study and others (e.g., Wrzesriewski. et al., 1999) show thatwe value other senses more. Information from such measures as the SoSQcould provide a rich source of information to clinicians responsible forindividuals who have lost their sense of smell through disease or accident.Finally, from a methodological standpoint, it would be useful to testthe validity and reliability of this and other measures further in thesecontexts and to compare responses on this measure directly with thosefrom the Affective Impact of Odour Scale (Wrzesriewski, et al., 1999).

MooreClarkAtlanta UniversityandNeuroscience Institute, Morehouse School of MedicineThe experimental manipulation of gonadal hormones in males has led to ageneral understanding that androgens (e.g., testosterone) modulate ag-gressive behavior. In numerous mammalian species, it has been commonlyobserved that castration reduces aggression and testosterone replacementcan restore aggressive behavior. Physiologically, castration can effectivelylower endogenous androgens, but the specific effects of castration onaggressive behavior in males is not fully understood. In this article, the roleof androgens in aggressive behavior will be examined in both animals andhumans. Empirical research from an animal model with hamsters will bereported to determine the efficacy of using castration as a treatment tocontrol human behavior (e.g., sexual aggression). In sum, basic animalresearch can provide clues to how hormones affect behavior in humans, andthe experimental findings presented in this article do not support theutilization of chemical castration to deter deviant sexual aggression inhumans.Animal studies can provide valuable information for behavioralresearchers to better understand how sex hormones influence behavior. Inmales, testosterone is one specific sex hormone that has been implicated inthe control of reproductive and aggressive behavior. Testosterone can beclassified as a gonadal hormone or androgen, and castration is oneexperimental technique that can be employed in a laboratory setting toinvestigate the role of sex hormones on male social behavior. The aim ofthis article will be to focus on the effects of castration on aggressivebehavior in animals as a clue to how efficacious castration is for controllinghuman behavior. Data from preliminary research with male hamsters willprovide the foundation for the views expressed in this article. Author's Info: Correspondence concerning this article should be sent to Timothy0.

No. 3. 503-520.NAJP508 504NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY ORGANIZATIONAL AND ACTIVATIONAL EFFECTS OFTESTOSTERONETestosterone is an androgen, and it is one of many steroid hormones thathas an organizational and activational role in male reproductive physiology(Baum, 1999; Kandel, Schwartz & Jessell, 2000). Other steroid or sexhormones would include progesterone and estrogen, and a simple illustrationof the biosynthesis of gonadal hormones in males can be found in Fig. 1 .Testosterone, progesterone, estradiol and estrogen are found in abundance inthe blood of both genders, but during development, there are changes inbrain morphology that reflect the presence of different levels of steroidhormones. A small portion of the neurons in the brain have receptors forspecific sex steroids, and testosterone receptors are concentrated ingenitalia, hair follicles, certain muscle groups, and a few brain regions thatregulate male development. As the brain differentiates to form a male or afemale, steroid hormones can activate sexually dimorphic nuclei (i.e., partsof the brain that differ in structure and appearance between the two genders)(see Matsumoto, 1999). Aro inataseCHOLESTEROL metabolism of gonadal hormones in males.Testosterone is synthesized from progesterone, and, in turn, is metabolized inthefetaland adult nervous system into estradiol(via aromatase) ordihydrotestosterone (via 5-alpha-reductase). Each steroid hormone can haveimportant metabolites which are not included in this drawing. An example of atestosterone metabolite involved in aggressive behavior is androstenedione. Gonadal hormones exert permanent effects on the developing centralnervous system and transient effects on the mature adult brain. Whether theeffects are permanent or transient, gonadal hormones can act on neurons inat least two ways. One is the classical pathway involving steroid receptors50 9BEST COPYAVAILABLE MooreTESTOSTERONE505 that activate or inhibit specific genes upon binding steroid. This is themechanism presumed to mediate organizational effects of hormones.Organizational effects of steroids cause the physical changes that separatethe genders, such as development of genitalia and musculoskeletaldifferences, and create central nervous system circuits that programreproductive behaviors. The second way steroids act on neurons involvesdirect action on the cell membrane via specific receptors. These activationaleffects are those seen at any time in life to stimulate steroid receptors andtemporarily modify sexual, aggressive and other behavioral activities(Kandel et al., 2000).The effects of gonadal hormones on sexual behavior will be brieflymentioned in this article to present a context for sexual aggression inhumans that can lead to deviant social behavior. The motivation andphysical expression for sexual and aggressive behavior can be intertwined,and gonadal hormones can influence the expression of both behaviors inmales. There is substantial evidence that gonadal hormones affect malereproductive behavior, but the activating effects of gonadal hormones onaggressive behavior in adult mammals deserves attention.TESTOSTERONE AND MALE BEHAVIORIn most species, the male is more aggressive than females, andtestosterone is the hormonal factor related to this sexually dimorphicbehavioral characteristic. In most mammals, the brain in either sex isfeminine until it is converted to a masculine form in males through theaction of testosterone (Goy & Mc Ewen, 1980). It is well known that duringcritical stages in neonatal development, testosterone induces organizationaleffects in the brain that later are expressed in terms of aggressive behavior(Schulkin, 1999). The hormone's early impact means a lifelong tendencytoward aggressive behavior (Glickman et al., 1992), and this tendency maybe expressed through specific neural circuits. In rodents, for example, thereis a neural circuit linked to aggression that includes the medial preoptic andanterior hypothalamic areas, the medial bed nucleus terminalis,and the medial nucleus of the amygdala (Albert, Jonik & Walsh, 1992;Ferris et al., 1997).Masculinization in rats can be reversed by removing testosterone fromthe male during the first 15 days after birth ( Schulkin, 1999), so the presenceof high levels of testosterone in males has been the sole source of theendocrine connection to aggressive behavior. Other than aggressivebehavior, testosterone can influence the central motive state in male rats tosearch for female rats and then try to mount them under suitable conditions(Beach, 1948). Also, there is evidence that the hormone itself is rewardingto male rats since male rats injected with testosterone returned to the place510 506NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY where the injection occurred more frequently than to others (Alexander,Packard, & Hines, 1994). Moreover, male rats treated with testosterone candiscriminate between female rats in estrus and those that are not (Baum,1992).Further evidence implicating testosterone and aggressive behavior stemsfrom studies with female animals. In numerous species, it is known thatfemales injected with testosterone during critical stages develop male-likeaggressive behavior when they become adults (Schulkin, 1999). They alsoexpress male-like characteristics during play-fighting and other sexuallydimorphic behaviors. The spotted hyena is one exception to the rule thatmales are more aggressive than females. Females are both larger and moreaggressive than males as a result of being exposed to higher concentrationsof testosterone and its metabolites in the womb (Glickman, et al., 1992).Female spotted hyenas have external male-like genitalia and they exhibitrougher play behaviors than do males. The presence of androstenedione, atestosterone metabolite, is higher in female hyenas compared to males, andthis hormone plays a key role in the development of aggressive behavior.CASTRATION AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORIn 1849, in one of the first experimental investigations with barnyardroosters,Berthold showed thatcastration can reduce endogenoustestosterone and reduce aggressive behavior (see Archer, 1988). Bertholdcastrated male roosters and then compared their behavior before and aftercastration. Intact birds were noisy and belligerent and castrates were quietand non-aggressive. When castrates were given daily injections oftestosteronetoreplacethe missing hormone, aggressive behaviorreappeared. The consistent finding across numerous species has been thatcastration in mammals reduces aggression and testosterone replacement canrestore aggressive behavior.CASTRATION AND HAMSTER BEHAVIORThere are numerous animal models that could be discussed, butextensive preliminary findings will be presented to demonstrate the value ofresearch using hamsters for the topic of gonadal hormones and aggressivebehavior. Hamsters are spontaneously aggressive animals, and they are anexcellent animal model to study the effects of castration on aggressivebehavior (Payne and Swanson, 1970; Swanson, 1967). Although it has beenwidely accepted over the last three decades that testosterone can modifyagonistic behavior in hamsters (Drickamer et critical or even necessary 4.liEST COPYAVAILABLE511 MooreTESTOSTERONE507 for the expression of aggressive behavior in adult male hamsters. Twoaggression paradigms that have been used extensively are the resident-intruder model and the neutral cage model. The first paradigm is a familiarsetting and the second paradigm is an unfamiliar setting. In both paradigms,hamsters regularly display spontaneous aggressive behavior in the presenceof a conspecific. In some studies, castration and the administration ofgonadal hormones to castrates can significantly influence the expression ofaggression in hamsters using either the resident-intruder model (Payne,1973, 1974) or the neutral cage paradigm (Grelk et al., 1974; Payne &Swanson, 1971, 1972; Vandenbergh, 1971). In other reports where therewas no reduction in male aggressive behavior following castration (Evans &Brain, 1974; Tiefer, 1970; Whitsett, 1975), the neutral cage model was used.In this article, data from both experimental settings will be presented.In addition to altering aggressive behavior, sexual behavior can beinfluenced by castration and the removal of circulating androgens.Understanding the reduction in both aggressive and sexual behaviorfollowing castration in animals can provide answers to the hormonalmechanisms that may stimulate a human to be sexually aggressive. Otherfactors such as social context, past history and mental state can profoundlyaffect a person to exhibit sexual aggression, but it is important to understandthe potential influence of male hormones. In studies with hamsters, forexample, there is evidence that sexual behavior is reduced after castratingmale hamsters and the behavior can be restored with testosteronereplacement (Wood & Newman, 1995). Compared to lower animals, sexualbehavior in humans is less closely linked to concentrations of gonadalhormones, so it may be more difficult to determine the effects of castrationon human behavior. The empirical evidence presented in the next section isfocused specifically on male hamster aggression. The potential use ofcastration to deter repeated sex offenders from committing sexual crimeswill be extrapolated from the results.EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS FROM THE LABORATORY OFNEUROENDOCRINOLOGY AND BEHAVIORBefore we can understand the effects of hormones on human behavior, itis necessary that we explore animal research to help us better elucidate theneurohormonal interactions that influence behavior. The following data arefrom four separate experiments that were conducted in a systematic fashionto determine whether or not gonadal hormones influence aggressivebehavior in hamsters. Each experiment was conducted separately over a 24month period with a different set of hamsters for each experiment, but thedata were analyzed collectively in this article to provide a foundation for theideas discussed here.512 508NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY Adult male Syrian hamsters (110-125 g)from Charles RiverLaboratories were isolated for two weeks in our animal colony prior toexperimentation. Hamsters were kept on a 14hr:10hr light:dark cycle, andfood and water were available ad lib.Group-housed hamsters remainedgroup-housed 4-5 per cage to serve as non-aggressive opponents throughoutexperimentation.In each of the four experiments, experimental hamsters were prescreenedfor aggressive behavior with a nonaggressive opponent for five minutes todetermine whether or not aggressive behavior would be displayed and tonormalize aggressive behavior between experimental animals. If a hamsterdid not attack a minimum of five times in five minutes, then it was excludedfrom the experiment. There was a bias to select experimental animals thatwould display aggressive and not submissive behavior to ensure we couldadequatelytesttheeffectsof castration.Followingprescreening,experimental hamsters were castrated or sham castrated. Behavioral testingfor each experiment began six weeks post-castration. The outcome of eachaggressive encounter produced a dominant (i.e., winner) and a subordinate(i.e., loser) animal. Experimental hamsters were tested in one of thefollowing conditions: (1) resident-intruder model with group-housedopponent; (2) resident-intruder isolated opponent; (3) neutralcage model with group-housed opponent; and (4) neutral cage model withisolated opponent. Each experiment was analyzed separately, and allbehavioral tests were recorded for five minutes by two independentobservers blind to the experimental condition.To interpret the effects of castration on aggressive behavior, the numberof attacks was chosen to represent the display of aggressive behavior. Figure2 illustrates the number of attacks observed in each social condition. Asignificant reduction in the number of attacks was only detected in theneutral cage arena with an isolated opponent. An independent t-Testcomparing the aggressive behavior of castrates and sham castrates in aneutral cage model with an isolated opponent revealed a statisticallysignificant difference on the number of attacks [t<12)=2.97; p<.01]. It appearsas though castrates were not as successful winning an encounter in a neutralcage with an equally aggressive opponent. On the other hand, there were nosignificant differences between the number of attacks between castrates andsham castrates in either the resident-intruder model with either type ofopponent or the neutral cage model when paired with a group-housedopponent. Overall, castrates fought as frequently as sham castrates in threeof the four social conditions. Although different groups of animals wereused in each experiment, aggressive behavior was relatively stable forcastrates in three of the four conditions, whereas the behavior of shamcastrates was more variable across experiments.5 / 3 MooreTESTOSTERONE509 FIGURE 2 Number of attacks in five minutes in a resident-intruder model (2A) anda neutral cage model (2B). Castrates (dark bars) and sham castrates (light bars) werepaired with either a group-housed opponent or an isolated opponent. A different setof experimental hamsters was used for each condition. In the resident-intrudermodel, there were no significant differences between groups. In the neutral cagemodel the number of attacks was significantly lower in castrates vs. sham castrateswhen paired with an isolated opponent. An asterisk indicates a significant differencebetween castrates and sham castrates (p < .01). 510NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY DOES CASTRATION REDUCE MALE AGGRESSION INANIMALS?According to previous research and the findings presented in this article,it is apparent that the effects of castration on male aggression are dependenton the social context of the test situation. Although there is substantiveevidence that sex hormones play significant roles in the expression ofaggressive behavior in numerous species, other authors reviewing theinteraction between hormones and aggression have concluded that thisrelationship is a highly complex one. The effects of hormonal treatment onaggressive behavior appear to be dependent on interactions with such factorsas gender, species, and model of aggressive behavior under consideration(Siegel and Demetrikopoulos, 1993).Nearly a century after Berthold's (1849) research with roosters, the sameeffects were observed in other species (Beach, 1948; Guhl, 1961; Young,1961). In the laboratory, however, the partial retention of androgen-dependent behavioral patterns has received attention (Hart, 1974). Miczekand DeBold (1983) reported that castration pacified only socially naiveanimals, rats with no prior fighting experience. Rats that were accustomedto defeating intruders, however, remained aggressive even after theirtestosterone levels were reduced. The findings presented in this article alsoshed light on the retention of aggressive behavior in experienced aggressivehamsters. The retention is certainly not due to residual amounts oftestosterone because the blood levels were non-detectable in castrates versussham castrates.There is no simple explanation for why aggressive behavior is retained incastrates or why castrates fought and won in three of the four conditions.Even more puzzling is why castrates lost in the neutral cage paradigm modelwith an isolated opponent if they could successfully defeat an isolatedopponent in a resident-intruder model. Castrates defeated an isolatedopponent in a familiar setting, but they were not as successful winning afight with an isolated opponent in an unfamiliar setting. In contrast to otherstudies using the neutral cage model (Evans & Brain, 1974; Tiefer, 1970;Whitsett, 1975), a significant reduction in aggression was observed in theneutral cage in this study, but only under specific social conditions.The castrated hamsters in this study were prescreened for aggressivebehavior. It is possible that the experience of behaving aggressively makesthe mediating neural substrate less sensitive to androgen changes and thebehavior much more resistant to the effects of castration (Hart, 1974). Thefinding that aggressive behavior is maintained following castration is not ananomalous result. In numerous species, the lack of an effect of castration onreducing aggressive behavior has been observed. For example, Demas andcolleagues (1999) demonstrated that castration does not impair aggressive515 MooreTESTOSTERONE511 behavior of male prairie voles in either a resident-intruder or a neutral cagemodel. Moreover, Phoenix, Slob and Goy (1973)observed no evidence of adecline in aggressive responses in adult male rhesus monkeys as much asone year after castration. In rhesus monkeys, neither seasonally norsurgically induced changes in hormone levels altered aggressive behavior(Dixson,1980;Gordon, Rose and Bernstein, 1976).One factor that should be considered in studying the effects of castrationon aggression is the subject. Barfield, Busch and Wallen (1972)havepointed out that the subject is both a responder and a stimulus to anotheranimal. Rodents primarily use olfactory cues for communication and asignificant change in gonadal hormones in castrates could differentiallyaffect the opponent's response to the subject. The effects of androgens onthe tendency of the subject to be aggressive is important, but the castrate'scapacity to evoke agonistic responses from the other animal is also involved.It is likely that the castrates presented a different stimulus for the isolatedopponent in the two different experimental settings. Castrates were able towin encounters in the neutral cage when the subject was group-housed, butthey were not as competitive against an isolated opponent in the neutralcage. On the other hand, isolated opponents were expected to be aggressive,and androgens appeared to increase the likelihood of winning an aggressiveencounter in a competitive and unfamiliar setting.In sum, the evidence presented in this article suggests that castrationdoes not always reduce aggressive behavior in animals. We can extrapolatefrom animal research that the effects of castration in humans may besimilarly expressed. Since the same controlled laboratory experimentsconducted on animals could not be performed on humans for ethical reasons,experimental research from animal studies can provide insight to howgonadal hormones affect human behavior. Individual differences can existin animals from experiment to experiment and the factor of individualdifferences can be even more pronounced in research with humans.Consequently, the effects of gonadal hormones on aggressive behavior arecomplex and dependent on an interaction between the organism's pastexperience, the external environment, and endogenous levels of androgens.Next, we will explore the effects of testosterone on aggressive behavior inhumans.TESTOSTERONE AND AGGRESSION IN HUMANSThe nature-nurture debate is a prelude to the assumption that tes-tosterone is responsible for aggressive behavior in humans. On one side ofthe debate are the biology advocates, who suggest that male hormones areprimarily responsible for aggressive behavior. On the other hand, the nurtureadvocates suggest that males learn aggressiveness and they are the product 512NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY of a culture that glorifies violence. The evidence for a causal relationshipbetween testosterone and aggression in humans is equivocal. A moreprudent position to take is that the social environment in the middle links theendocrine system and the external world to affect an individual's aggressivenature (Niehoff, 1999).Testosterone levels in boys begin to surge at approximately age ten, riserapidly over the next several years, and finally begin to plateau at about agefourteen (Susman, Worrall and Murowchick, 1996). During the plateauperiod, peer group rankings shift daily, with petty quarrels, athleticcompetitions, academic events, conflicts with parents, and girls offeringample opportunities for boys to be aggressive. Testosterone availability hasincreased during puberty to handle the challenges associated with thesesocial conflicts. These are logical interpretations of how testosterone mayaffect human behavior, but there are data which fail to support a relationshipbetween antisocial and/or aggressive behavior and elevated testosteronelevels (Nottleman, Inoff-Germain et al., In another study (Olweus, Mattsson & Low,1988), boys with higher levels of testosterone were more impatient andirritable, readily frustrated, and quick to take offense. The tendency to startfights, rather than fight back, was less strongly correlated with hormonelevels. Hormones may be the most obvious biological event of puberty, butadolescent violence, like adult violence, is more likely to be a product of abrain that has developed a misguided notion of threat than a brain fired upby testosterone (Niehoff, 1999).The psychoactiveeffectsof testosterone,however, cannot for the effect of testosterone re-placement therapy can be found in research with hypogonadal men.Correcting testosterone deficiency in these men results in significantsubjective and objective improvement in energy, vitality, and sexual desireand activity (Alexander et al., 1997). Although the effects of replacingphysiologic testosterone doses to hypogonadal men is clear, the effects ofsupraphysiological doses is more complex (Yates, 2000). The illicit use ofanabolic-androgenic steroids can provide a source of information about thebehavioral effects of increased levels of gonadal hormones in humans.The rise in the illicit use of testosterone and the synthetic analogs calledanabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs) is an example why research is neededon the behavioral effects of gonadal hormones in adult humans. AASs havebeen used illicitly to improve athletic performance and personal appearance(Buckley et al., Durant et al., 1993; Yesalis, Kennedy, Kopstein &Bahrke, 1993;). Over the last decade, there have been increasing reports thatsome AAS users develop marked aggression (Burnett & Kleiman, 1994;Choi, Parrott & Cowan, 1990; Parrott, Choi & Davies, 1994; Pope & Katz,J1 Pi MooreTESTOSTERONE513 1988;). Other behavioral changes include mania, hypomania, depressivesymptoms and suicidiality during AAS withdrawal. Understanding theeffects of testosterone on human behavior is made more complex becauseindividual differences exist and the context in which the testosterone or theAAS is consumed could affect the behavioral response. In a randomizedcontrolled trial with 56 men aged 20 to 50 years of age, a battery of testswere conducted on the effects of supraphysiological doses of testosterone onmood and aggression (Pope, Kouri & Hudson, 2000). The results werevariable and not uniform across subjects. Most showed little psychologicalchange, whereas a few developed prominent effects. The authors concludedthat the mechanism of these variable reactions remains unclear.The role of testosterone in male aggression is a public health concern. Iftestosterone can stimulate people to exhibit higher levels of aggressivebehavior, then there may be an escalation of aggressive activity or violentacts committed in society. Therefore, the illicit use of AASs can beproblematic. Providing AASs to young people cannot be conducted forethical reasons, but using animal models with hamsters can provide valuableinformationFor example, hamsters treated with high doses of AAS during theiradolescent development showed heightened measures of aggression in aresident-intruder model (Melloni et al., 1997). Harrison and colleagues(2000) recently examined the hypothesis that exposure to AASs duringadolescent development predisposes hamsters to heightened levels ofaggressive behavior by influencing specific nuclei in the hypothalamus.Their data suggest that adolescent AAS exposure can increase aggressionintensity in hamsters by altering anterior-hypothalamic-arginine vasopressinexpression and activity. In conjunction with animal studies, it is necessaryto conduct human research to determine the behavioral effects of elevatingtestosterone with AASs as well as reducing testosterone with chemicals.IS CHEMICAL CASTRATION A PLAUSIBLE TREATMENT FORSEX OFFENDERS?Chemical modification of the sex steroids or their receptors has beendeveloped as a treatment for sex offenders. If sexual aggression is anendocrine problem, then removing the offending hormone must be thesolution.It sounds like a logical step to treat sexual aggression, but theanimal data presented in this article demonstrates that castration is acomplex phenomena.In a review of hormone treatment of sex offenses (Thibaut, Kuhn,Cordier & Petit, 1998), it has been reported that recent advances in theunderstanding of factors that are associated with sexual aggression have ledto improved methods of treatment. A number of organic treatments whichreduce the plasma testosterone levels or decrease androgen effects on target516 514NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY cells is available. These treatments may reduce the chance of re-offending,so the judicial system would invest time and resources into chemicalcastration as a plausible treatment for sexually aggressive offenders.Depo-Provera (medroxy-progesterone acetate) was synthesized for useas a contraceptive but was later found to have extensive properties as anandrogen antagonist, reducing testosterone levels in males and effecting astate that is the same as reversible chemical castration (Gordon et al., 1970;Meyers et al., 1985). Use of the drug to treat rapists is not supported bypsychiatric studies and would appear to be a medical experiment conductedby judges outside of the medical or research establishment (Ayres, 1996).There is controversy over the use of chemical castration in humans and thearguments are based on the myth that testosterone is the hormone foraggression.Reducing testosterone levels in impulsive or antisocial sex offenders islikely to have an impact only on their sexual behavior because theirprincipal problem is aggression, not sex (Niehoff, 1999). When you takeaway sex from a rapist who is also a psychopath, you must still treat thepsychopathic behavior. Trials with Depo-Provera and other testosteroneblocking drugs, involving hundreds of sex offenders, have demonstrated thatalthough these drugs appear to decrease sexual behavior (Zigmond, Finlayand Sved, 1995), they have little or no effect on antisocial aggression(Raine, 1993, 1996).For some rapists and child molesters, sex is a weapon and the deviantperson acts impulsively to assault another person. The aggressive act couldbe for revenge, power or control. In the case of rape, the deviant behavior isconsidered to be an act of assault and rape is the gun. Depo-Provera wouldnot effectively treat someone who has the neural circuitry, mentality andsocial experience for committing aggressive sex acts.Paraphilias are disorders of sexual deviation and the offenders aremotivated by intense, uncontrollable cravings for socially unacceptable sexacts and partners. Sexual behavior is malleable, so treating some paraphiliaswith Depo-Provera has been successful (Berlin et al., 1991). In more severecases of paraphilia that involve predatory behavior and even death of thevictim(s), Depo-Provera would probably be ineffective. The sexual needs ofpredatory psychopaths are so inexorably enmeshed with their antisocialaggression that many experts fear that they may be beyond responding toany intervention, chemical or otherwise (Niehoff, 1999).In 1980, Freund reported on three sex-drive-reducing therapies designedfor male patients: 1) pharmacological reduction of circulating testosterone;2) surgical castration; and 3) deletion of certain brain structures. Since theFreund report, Thibaut et al. (1998) reviewed the current literature andreported that surgical castration and treatment with estrogens or Depo- MooreTESTOSTERONE515 Provera are no longer used. The authors advocate a clinical treatment of agonadotropic releasing hormone analogue (triptoreline) in conjunction withpsychotherapy, which seems to benefit offenders who are motivated fortreatment.In sum, the primary effect of castration is to remove endogenous levelsof testosterone. As discussed previously, the physiological effects ofremoving testosterone appear to have varied behavioral effects that probablyexist due to the social context of the test situation and individual differenceswithin subjects. In the case of repeated sex offenders, chemical castration isnot effective because the problem is primarily aggression and not anabnormalappetiteforsex.Chemicallycastrating humansisnotrecommended as a primary treatment to control repeated sex offenders suchas rapists and child molesters. Compared to chemical castration as a singletreatment, incarceration in conjunction with psychotherapy can be used tohelp a patient manage urges that lead to sexual aggression. Overall, theeffects of testosterone are difficult to understand when it is chemicallyenhanced with AASs as well as surgically or chemically removed withDepo-Provera.CONCLUSIONIt is difficult to predict behavior because it is a challenge to decipher theinterplay between internal as well as external factors that affect behavior.Without controlled animal experiments, the specific brain mechanismsinvolved in producing behavior would be difficult to understand. In thisarticle, we have presented evidence that male hamsters maintain aggressivebehavior following castration. They were capable of winning and exhibitingaggressive behavior in specific social conditions. However, when challengedwith a potentially aggressive opponent in a neutral arena, castrates were notas successful winning a fight. It appears as though gonadal hormones canaffect aggressive behavior in male hamsters but the strength of the effect isdependent on the social context.The retention of sexual behavior in mammals following castration maybe due to the principle that in animals with a more highly evolved forebrain,gonadal hormones are less important for maintaining aggression andsociosexual behaviors (Hart, 1974). In human and nonhuman primates, it iswell known that male hormones are an important factor in male sexualbehavior. Since human as well as nonhuman primate behavior is controlledby intricate neural circuits and multiple social factors that influence sexualbehavior, the chemical control of behavior is less critical as we go up thephylogenetic scale.Due to the complexity of human life, testosterone's varied effects inhumans are probably more difficult to understand versus lower animals.52 0 516NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY However, primates, sex and status go hand in hand, and clues to the role oftestosterone in male aggression can be found in nonhuman primates. Fromreviewing nonhuman primate literature, Niehoff (1999) has questioned iftestosterone could have more to do with the desire to win versus the desireto kill. In a related finding, we observed that a lack of testosterone in onegroup of castrated hamsters appeared to decrease their \"desire\" ormotivation to defeat an aggressive conspecific in a neutral cage model. Thedesire to win is an interesting conceptualization for the role of testosteronebecause it may relate to competition in the human context. For example,higher levels of testosterone may increase the likelihood of winning acompetitive encounter. It does not preclude, however, that a person withhigh levels of testosterone will always be more aggressive.In conclusion, our brains are molded by our experiences and someexperiences are long-lasting and cannot be modified by a single chemicalsuch as testosterone. Surgical and chemical castration in males caneffectively lower gonadal hormones, but a reduction in aggressive behaviorfollowing castration is not clearly evident. In both animals and humans, thetype of social experience presented before the organism as well as thecontext of the situation presented before the organism can affect the waygonadal hormones influence behavior.REFERENCESAlbert, D.J., Jonik, R.H. hormonal, foundations.Physiology and Behavior, 16, 177-192.Alexander, G.M., Packard, M.G. & Hines, M.

Chandra Levy, The Missing Intern: Social,Forensic, and Psychology InsightsRussell EisenmanUniversity of Texas-Pan AmericanThe case of Chandra Levy, the missing intern, is discussed, with insightsdrawn from social, forensic, and evolutionary psychology. The media areshown to handle the case in a particular way, emphasizing it, in part,because of the attractiveness--in the broadest sense of the term--of Ms.Levy. The concept of deviance explains a lot about how the case has beenpresented, withinitial views of Congressman Condit being mostlyfavorable, until he was forced to reveal facts. Ultimately this resulted inhis acquiring stigma. The police then handled the case differently. Someideas are almost never mentioned by the media, such as the possibility ofher internship with the Bureau of Prisons putting her in contact with aconvict who may have contacted her later, or had a friend contact her.From the standpoint of evolutionary psychology theory, there is nothingunusual in the older congressman being attracted to a young woman, andvice versa.As this is written, Chandra Levy is still missing. No body has beenfound, nor has there been any evidence to show that she has chosen, onher own, to disappear. Provided here are some insights into the casedrawn from social, forensic, and evolutionary psychology. The way thecase is handled in the media reveals important issues confronting themedia and our perceptions of public figures.Sick of the Story, But FascinatedIn many ways, one can become sick of the Chandra Levy story, atleast the way it is presented in the media. The main reason is that, earlyon, the new stories offered so little new information. At times, one couldfeel like yelling into the television set: \"If you have nothing new to say,shut up!\" Television reports about the case appeared and reappeared sooften, with so little information most of the time. But, it is, per se, aninteresting story. It is also interesting in terms of how the media report it,and how some of the people involved in the story deal with it, especiallyCongressman Gary Condit, Levy's friend and sponsor of her internshipwith the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

No. 3, 521-528.NAJP 522NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The Police and Congressman ConditThe police investigation is proceeding in, apparently, a fairly routinemanner, or at least that is what the police want you to think. She is stillclassified as a missing person, even though there is information to makeone think she has been killed, or, perhaps, committed suicide. However,the police do not want to say things that will come back to haunt them- -either in court or reputation wise--, so silence is the best tactic for them.They say as little as possible, and pursue the investigation on their ownterms. Police often have ways of proceeding that are standard for them,but are virtually unknown to the general public (Arrigo, 2001; Dantzker,1997, 1998, 1999; McArdle & Erzen, 2001).Often, the police will do more when a famous person is involved, or aperson is involved who has contacts with famous people, or is wealthy,or has wealthy parents, etc. We do not know what is really going on withthe police, behind the scenes. We do know, however, that initially, thepolice publicly took the position that Congressman Condit was not asuspect. He seemed to get special treatment, due to his status. Imaginewhat would occur if some working class or unemployed person was inhis position: likely a former boyfriend, but one who denies it, and denieshaving much contact with the disappeared person, even though there isreason to think he may be less than totally forthcoming. Would the policesay things on television to indicate that they are investigating a missingperson case and that even if there was sexual contact that is not what thecase is about? That almost never occurs. So, the congressman appears tohave received special treatment from the police, at least initially.The police only started treating him differently when it turned out thatdespite his early denials, he had had a sexual affair with Chandra Levyand his early reports about limited contact with her turned out not to betrue. Then, the police did what they more typically do to people in hisposition (not his position as Congressman, but his position as theboyfriend of a missing or murdered person). They started treating himmore harshly, demanding that he let them search his apartment, forexample, and demanding that he take a police or FBI-administeredpolygraph. What changed? It was, apparently, Condit's admissions thathis earlier statements about not being sexually involved with Levy andnot having much contact with her were false. Either by omission ofcertain details of their relationship, or perhaps by issuing misleadingstatements, Condit apparently sought to minimize his relationship withthe young intern. Congressman Condit's admissions appear to have beencoerced by Chandra Levy's family, who knew something about the realrelationship and, reportedly, threatened to go public if the congressman,himself, did not tellthe truth about the relationship, according totelevision news reports (ABC. CNN Headline News, and others).-527 EisenmanCHANDRA LEVY523 Once he admitted his previously denied, or at least not fully admitted,sexual relationship to the police, their image of him changed, and he nowwas seen as deviant, in the sense of having stigma associated with himand thus being labeled as someone who is not so nice or not so in need ofprotection. This is how the social perception of deviance often operates(Eisenman, 1991; Goffman, 1963). Something occurs that produces stig-ma in a person, and then that person is looked at as different, i. e., asdeviant, not the same as a normal person (Eisenman, 1991; Goffman,1963; Heatherton, Kleck, Hebl, & Hull, 2000). Often what occurs toproduce stigma is some kind of social labeling. Thus, the person seen asdeviant may not be truly guilty of anything really bad, but that person isnow perceived that way, due to having been labeled (Eisenman, 1999b).In fact, even when there is something in the person that makes themtruly different, it is still necessary for a social labeling to occur in orderfor them to be perceived as deviant. Thus, it could be said that sociallabeling is crucial to the process for deviance to occur. I do not mean,however, to endorse a sociological theory, called social labeling,proponents of which tried to deny that there was anything truly deviant insome people called deviant (Becker, 1963; Lemert, 1972; Schur, 1971).In some cases there is only social labeling and a normal person is seen asdeviant, but in other cases, e.g., serious mental illness or serious crime,there is something about the person that is different than most others. Inthe case of serious mental illness, it may be something biological. In thecase of serious criminals,it may be merely their behavior that isdifferent, but that is, nonetheless, a major difference. Most people are notserious, habitual, criminal offenders. Thus deviance can be perceivedeither because there is something about the person that really is different,or because of social labeling of a person who is not different, but islabeled and perceived as different (Bryant, 1990; Heatherton, Kleck, Hebl, & Hull, 2000).The police do not want to rule out the possibility that she has runaway, perhaps for some of the reasons mentioned here: lover's argument,involvement with a prisoner, unhappiness at not getting her internshipextended or not getting a job she wanted, or any other possibility thatcauses people to run away. And, it may be wise for the police to pretendto trust Congressman Condit even if they do not. By seeming to trustsomeone the police may elicit a greater degree of cooperation, includinghaving the person talk to them. If the police identify someone as asuspect, that person's attorney would likely tell the person not to speak tothe police, or at least to limit what they say. 524NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY The CongressmanIt would not be unusual, statistically, to think that Congressman GaryCondit might have killed Levy in a lover's dispute. According to theViolence Policy Center (as mentioned on Court TV on August 27, 2001),57% of female murder victims are killed by boyfriends or husbands.Perhaps she discovered that he was not serious about her, when shehoped he would be. This is a reasonable inference, based on statementsmade on televised reports by Chandra Levy's aunt, in whom Ms. Levyconfided, and statements by Congressman Condit minimizing therelationship. The aunt said that Chandra told her the Congressman had afive-year plan to leave his wife and marry her. Disputes over level ofcommitment are typical in male-female conflict that occurs from time totime.Accordingtoevolutionarypsychology, men mainly desirenumerous partners who have youth, health, and beauty, in order to spreadtheir genes as much as possible, to insure their genes going into futuregenerations, while womensince they get pregnantcannot use thesame gene-spreading strategy. Instead, women seek men with status andmoney, who will care for them and their cultures and found strong support for male-female differences inattraction and other aspects of evolutionary psychology theory, includingdifferences in what makes males vs. females jealous. Buss (1989) foundthat males are frequently made jealous by any sexual intercourse theirpartner has, since it could result in her pregnancy and thus his raising achild who will not send his genes into future generations. On the otherhand, females are less likely to be jealous over their male partner's sexualintercourse with another woman, but are more likely to become jealous ifthere is a threat of her man showing commitment to the other woman.Thus, intercourse per se makes men jealous, while commitment is themore important issue for female jealousy. From this, it would follow thatmen would be more often jealous of the partner's having a sexual affair,since any unprotected intercourse is a threat to having his genes go intofuture generations.We do not need to hold it against Congressman Condit if he and Ms.Levy were lovers. This would be a very human characteristic, and, froman evolutionary psychology standpoint, would reflect his desire (albeitunconscious; see Eisenman, 2001) to spread his genes as much aspossible into future generations. He would not want to admit the sexualaffair, as it can hurt his reputation and political career, so he is in adifficult position. But, the police are likely to be concerned that aboyfriend killed his girlfriend--as they routinely think this way in such529 EisenmanCHANDRA LEVY525 circumstances--and not let protection of a powerful politician weakentheir pursuit of this angle. Since police are, by the nature of their work, afairly secretive organization, we cannot really know what they thinkabout the case.Ironically, during the Clinton scandal, also involving an intern,Monica Lewinsky, Congressman Condit called for full disclosure. Hesaid the Starr report on the President should be released to the public, asopposed to coming out a little at a time. He was opposed to having it be\"drip, drip, drip.\" But, now the shoe is on the other foothis foot--andhe is behaving differently. There have been reports that the police havetried to speak with him on a few occasions, and he has attempted to avoidthem. He apparently only spoke with them after Chandra Levy's parentsmet with him, and agreed to stop saying things to the media about himbeing her lover, if he would meet with the police (although it should benoted that Congressman Condit disputes this, and claims he wascooperative from the beginning). Even in his meetings with the police, hedid not reveal until the third of four police interviews that he had anaffair with Chandra Levy, according to television news reports.Why All the Publicity?However, we should keep in mind that many people disappear. So,why does this story get so much publicity? In part, it is the story of apolitician and an intern, bringing to mind the President Clinton-MonicaLewinsky scandal. Also, it is because she is an attractive, young, whitewoman. If any of those demographic categories about her were different,we would probably not hear so much about it. These four categoriesyoung, attractive, white, female-- are ones that our society values in thecase of a victim--so it makes for good television.The story has some interesting features, but so would the stories ofother missing people. However, the media do not necessarily report thetruth, but give a slant that appeals to people, such as \"real-life\" policeshows on television, which often present events in ways that differ fromwhat usually occurs (Eisenman, 1999a). For example, they often show astolen car recovered almost immediately, after an exciting chase. Do youreally think, if your car is stolen, that you are likely to get it back soon,and in good shape, and the criminals will be apprehended? But, peopleenjoy seeing a good ending, so there is profit to be made in presentingthings in a positive way, even when it is unrealistic.A Stranger Could Have Done ItBesides thinking that the congressman was her lover and killed her ina lover's dispute, it is quite possible that a stranger did it. Washington,530 526NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY DC is a very dangerous place to live. The fact that she walked home fromher gym workout made her a likely victim to some violent criminal.The Bureau of Prisons AngleChandra Levy worked as an intern for the Bureau of Prisons. Did shehave contact with prisoners? This has apparently never been disclosed.Prisoners are often dangerous people. Perhaps one got out and decided tocontact her. Or, he passed her name along to a friend. This angle has notbeen adequately pursued, at least by the media.Yet, prisoners will sometimes try to contact people they meet in theprison. Also, based on unpublished case studies that have come to myattention, sometimes women fall in love with prisoners, and initiate thecontact and future relationships with them, often with disastrous results.These contacts may occur because the prisoner is a master in man-ipulation, and knows how to make the woman feel good when she iscommunicating with him. The woman may have a rescue fantasy, inwhich she imagines or believes that if she is good to the prisoner this willhelp reform him. Also, since he is in a captive situation, she does not getto see him in a setting where he has the opportunity to misbehave. Onceout, any relationship runs the risk of the criminal's real personalitycoming to the fore, with all the negative things that can mean. Malessometimes get involved with prisoners, too, but the goal is usuallystrictly sexual, whereas the female involvement with prisoners seemsmore often predicated on love interests.Why We CareWhat the media have done is make us look at Chandra Levy as a realperson, even though, actually, we have only limited insights into her andher life. But, it has shown her to us in a way that we \"feel\" for her. Weare made to feel like we know her. We even see home videos of her andher family. We see her smiling, eating, interacting with other familymembers. This gives us the false sense that we know her, since these arebasic human behaviors that we have all engaged in.We see her as a fellow human, probably hurt in some unknown way.It arouses empathy. This is done, in large part, because she is young,attractive, and white (possibly, too, because she is female; males aresupposed to be tough and take care of themselves, while females aresometimes seen as vulnerable and in need of protection). Youth andattractiveness appeals to almost everyone, while whiteness appeals to themajority of the United States population, which is predominantly white.However, for minorities, they would likely have more interest in a storyabout someone from their racial or ethnic group.\" 3 1 EisenmanCHANDRA LEVY527 ConclusionThere areseveralreasons why the Chandra Levy case issointeresting to many of us. Indeed, the media would not focus on it somuch unless they thought it would have a great deal of public appeal.The story of a politician and an intern is interesting for its own sake, andalso reminds us of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. The demographiccharacteristics of Ms. Levy-- young, attractive, white, female-- make herattractive to us (in the most general sense of the word \"attractive\"). Thehome videos of her, repeatedly shown on television, further humanize herand make us feel as though we know her, even though we do not. Theconcept of deviance is useful for understanding the changed perceptionsof Congressman Condit. Various forensic, social, and evolutionarypsychology insights are provided above. To take only one example, fromanevolutionarypsychologystandpoint,itisnotunusualthatCongressman Condit was attracted to a young intern, and vice versa.Evolutionary psychology theory \"sees\" this as very normal humanbehavior, regardless of whether it is socially acceptable.REFERENCESArcher, J.

Self-Definition in Psychotherapy:Is it Time to Revisit Self-Perception Theory?Rostyslaw W. RobakPace UniversityPeople in psychotherapy define themselves through the narratives andstories they construct about themselves. This post-modern idea is thefoundation of much current psychotherapy and family therapy. Thisnotion can be explained by Bern's (1972) self-perception theory.Individuals in therapy observe their own behaviors and define themselveson the basis of their self-perceived behaviors. A six-step process of self-definition based on self-perception in psychotherapy is proposed. Whenseveral traditional therapy approaches are examined in this context, self-definition appears to be a key process in psychotherapy. Hypotheses forfuture research are outlined.A central process in counseling and psychotherapy is the narration ofone's story.Several current approaches to therapy are founded on thispremise. The constructivist approach, for example, emphasizes clients'creating their own realities, constructing their life stories, and findingnew meanings or themes in their lives (e.g., Franklin & Nurius, 1996;Granvold, 1996; Neimeyer, 1995). In contrast to older \"rationalist\" cog-nitive therapies that are based on first-order assumptions about change(i.e., addressing \"problem\" behaviors directly), constructivist therapiesare guided by second-order principles and processes of every individual'sconstructing his or her preferred realities (Lyddon, 1990). Narrativetherapy, a related family therapy approach, emphasizes the constructionof story structures in order to give meaning to experiences and to helppeople see themselves as separate from their problems (e.g., Etchison 2000; Feixas, 1990; Freedman & Combs, 1996; approaches focus on an underlying process of self-definition.More traditional models of therapeutic change, such as psychoanalyticself psychology (Linden, 1994) and person-centered therapy (Rogers,1951) also rely on this foundational process. Therapies that emphasizepersonal narrative necessarily have self-definition as a key process. Intherapy, as elsewhere, the definitions of our selves and our self-conceptsaccrue from the information that we feel defines us. Our self-concepts(perceptions of our own personal characteristics) do not necessarilyaccurately describe our characteristics, but they do serve to summarize Author info: Correspondence should be sent to: Dr. Rostyslaw W.

No. 3, 529-534.NAJP534 530NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY and organize our assumptions about our personal qualities (McGuire &McGuire, 1988; Rosenberg, 1986).Self-concepts do change. Persons can have many self-concepts overtime (Baumeister, 1998). For instance, people change their self-beliefsbased on the self-presentations they make to others, and such changesaffect their behaviors and their self-concepts (Fazio, Effrein, & Fa lender,1981; Schlenker, 1994). Kelly (2000) has proposed that self-presentationand impression management strategies by psychotherapy clients arecrucial to successful psychotherapy. She proposed a four-step model ofchange in psychotherapy based on a self-presentational process thatinvolves:(1) clients' performing various self-presentations (favorableself-descriptions), (2) therapists' giving feedback based on the clients'self-presentations, (3) such feedback leading to clients' shifts in self-beliefs, and (4) changes in self-beliefs leading to changes in clients' self-concepts. This perspective is significant because it puts self-descriptionat the center of psychotherapy. However, clients' self-presentations(impression management) to an expert audience (the therapist) andtherapists'feedback based on impressions from a client-selectedpresentation may not be enough to capture a key process in psycho-therapy.About thirty years ago Daryl Bern (1972) articulated self-perceptiontheory. According to self-perception theory, people come to knowthemselves in the same way that they come to know others. They observetheir own behaviors in a variety of situations and then they makeattributions about their behaviors.Of course, people are free to make so-called fundamental attributionerrors (Ross, 1977). Most of the time we prefer to attribute the causes ofbehaviors in others to personality traits or internal factors, rather thansituational ones. We tend to think that another person's actions arecaused by something within, rather than being caused by circumstances,or external, situationalfactors. The personality traitsto which weattribute our own behaviors can be seen as self-definitions. This is es-peciallytrueinthecontextofnarrativesaboutourselvesinpsychotherapy.It may be useful to outline specifically how self-definition operates incounseling and psychotherapy. Such a model can serve to identify thestages of the process.It should also point out a basis for the reciprocalnature of therapy.Here is a proposed six-step outline of the self-definition process incounseling and psychotherapy. In a psychotherapy experience, peoplelearn about themselves by observing their own behaviors:1.They observe and attend to the things they say aboutthemselves in counseling sessions.2.The therapist encourages new behaviors, including newec.3 RobakSELF-DEFINITION IN THERAPY 531 recognitions of feelings, new experiences and new cognitions.3.People then try out new behaviors, both in and out of thecounseling sessions.4.With the counselor's help, they reflect on these new behaviors:What do these behaviors say about their self-definitions?5.They then redefine their selves according to their new behaviors.6.Feedback from others, including the counselor and other membersin a group counseling setting, allows them to monitor the changes.It may be that when this sequence occurs, therapists quite often noticethat the therapy is \"working.\" Perhaps good counseling and psycho-therapy experiences can be best understood as instances of heightenedself-perception.Traditional systems of counseling and psychotherapy explain whytheir particular approaches work, and all offer guidelines for the process.But what is the essence of the change process? Perhaps the simplestexplanation is that people change as they try new behaviors, observethese, and thus change their definitions of who they are.Hereisone example. Recovering alcoholics do not just seethemselvesas\"alcoholics.\"They seethemselvesas\"recoveringalcoholics.\"But, recovering alcoholics who relapse no longer seethemselves as recovering persons; they now see themselves as hopelessalcoholics. They have observed their own (relapsing) behavior andconcluded that they will always be alcoholics. They may say somethingto themselves like: \"I'm drinking, therefore I'm an alcoholic,\" and \"Aslong as I'm an alcoholic I might as well drink and have a good time.\"Then they usually drink some more. Marlatt & George (1984) havecalled this the \"abstinence violation effect.\" Although cognitive dis-sonance may also explain relapse behavior, the important point is that thecognitions,which determineself-definitions, emergelargely fromobserving one's own behaviors.We are much more likely to come to know ourselves, according toself-perception theory, by observing our own behaviors in a variety ofsituations than by introspecting about \"Who am I?\" In counseling andpsychotherapy, this means that the person needs to first try out newbehaviors and then to reflect on what these mean to his or herself-definition.Many traditional psychotherapy approaches are well explained fromthis perspective. Here are a few examples from the most prominentapproaches. Rogerian counselors believe that exploring one's feelingsand experience leads to greater acceptance of these and to a redefinitionof the self. Rogers saw counseling as a process of \"learning of self\" andrejecting older ways of self-definition (Rogers & Stevens, 1967). From aself-definition and self-perception perspective: As we express our own 532NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY feelings and experiences and then take a look at them, we get to knowwho we are.Traditional cognitive behaviorists, such as Ellis (2000), are directive:they ask their clients to dispute and attack their own \"irrational\" beliefsand they routinelyassign homework between sessions. From theperspective of self-perception theory, clients are taught new ways ofobserving their own thoughts and behaviors. Homework is crucial. It isan opportunity for clients to try out new behaviors and to consider thatthey are the kind of person who can do these (homework) things.Successful change occurs when clients try new thoughts and behaviors,observe them, and change their perceptions and definitions of them-selves.How we get clients to try new behaviors is a function of how creativewe are and how persuasive we are. For example, Milton Erickson (Haley,1973) would get his clients to try new behaviors in various creative ways,including having them go into a \"trance.\" Once, when a married couplecame to him for counseling, he asked them to climb a mountain outsideof Phoenix. Furthermore, he insisted that their task was not completeduntil they had gone through a process of making attributions. He wantedthem to consider why they had done this unusual assignment. What didtheir behavior mean? He was actively encouraging an attribution processthat directly affected his clients' definitions of themselves and promoted aprocess of self-perception.Psychodynamically-oriented therapy may also be most effective whenit fosters self-perception. Freud (1955) believed that cure follows insight.But perhaps change is catalyzed only in those cases when the insight isbased on the patient's trying out some new behavior as a result of therapyexperiences.When self-perception theory is systematically applied to the processof self-definition that occurs in therapy, several hypotheses for futureempirical validation become apparent. Experiential, active approachesare more effective than passive ones. Active homework assignments withan in-session emphasis on what those homework behaviors mean to theperson's definition of oneself are more effective than homework withoutthe self definition (or no homework at all). Change should follow thoseinsights that are based on trying new behaviors that can be self-observedrather than those based on understanding only. Counseling and psy-chotherapy should include a heavy dose of trying new behaviors that canbe self-observed and considered in terms of self-definition.Future research should test these hypotheses. First, the degree towhich therapists recognize self-definition as a therapeutic process in theirwork needs to be measured. Second, clients' perceptions of key aspectsof their therapy experiences need to be addressed from this perspective.5 RobakSELF-DEFINITION IN THERAPY 533 In particular, two measures beg development: a general measure ofindividuals' recognition of their self-perception processes and a measureof psychotherapy clients' judgments about the key change processes inpsychotherapy. The degree of change and satisfaction reported by clientsof therapists from different approaches can, for example, provide someanswers to questions that long been waiting to be answered.

Darin MatthewsJames Madison University The CitadelPhillip E. Gagne'James Madison UniversityA surprising finding in memory research is that cues consisting of part ofthe material studied can inhibit recall of the remainder of the material.However, Watkins, Schwartz, and Lane (1984) found that providingchessplayers during recall with part of a previously studied chess positiondid not inhibit recall of the remainder of the position. Chess pieces werechosen at random to be in the cued condition. however, which did notutilize how players organize information in \"chunks\" (patterns of relatedpieces). The present study used chunks to be more sensitive to howmemory organization affects the occurrence of part-set cuing inhibition.Realistic game positions were presented to 12 expert and 12 novicechessplayers and recall of correct piece placement in cued and uncuedconditions was measured. Consistent with previous research on chessexpertise, experts recalled significantly more pieces than novices. As inthe Watkins et al. study, recall was not inhibited in the cued condition.This is consistent with findings that part-set cuing is less likely to have aneffect on automatic than on conscious tasks. Development of chess skillinvolvesautomatizationof processesinvolvedinrecallingpieceplacement, so that conscious resources can be used for move selection.Typically, memory research has shown that an event is more likely tobe remembered if stimuli that were present during that event arepresented again during recall. These stimuli presumably serve as con-textualcuesthatfacilitatememory,possiblybyre-establishingassociations made during the event. Numerous researchers (e.g., Morris,Bransford and Franks, 1977; Tulving and Pearlstone, 1966; Tulving andThomson, have provided evidence of the facilitative effects of cueson recall. One effect, however, of cues on recall has received lessattention -- specifically, the inhibiting influence that cues can have onrecall when the cue consists of part of a previously studied set of items.This negative effect of cuing has been aptly named part-set cuingAuthor info: Correspondence should be sent to Charles J.

Participants are instructed to use this subset of items as cues tohelp them remember the remainder of the items that were studied. Whenperformance in the part-set cuing condition is compared to a situation inwhich participants are not provided with cues, recall is often found to beworse in the cued condition than in the uncued condition (Roediger,1974; Rundus, 1973; Slamecka, 1968). This effect has been demonstratedwith related (Roediger, 1973; Watkins, 1975) and unrelated wordlists (Slamecka, 1968). Furthermore, this inhibitory effect of retrievalcues on memory has also been found with nonverbal materials such aspictureidentification (Peynircioglu,1987). These findings contrastsharply with studies that demonstrate the facilitative effects of retrievalcues on memory.Given that cues can either facilitate (e.g., Tulving & Thomson, 1971)or inhibit recall (e.g., Nickerson, 1984), factors that affect the occurrenceof facilitation or inhibition need to be delineated. This study examinesthe way in which chessplaying expertise and cuing may interact to affectrecall of previously seen chess positions. The game of chess has oftenbeen useful as a laboratory task to explore how organization in memorychanges asexpertise develops, and how that organization affectsperformance on various memory tasks (see Ericsson & Smith, 1991 for areview).In a previous study that examined the effects of part-set cuing on therecallof chesspositions(Watkins,Schwartz, & Lane,1984),chessplayers were presented with 10 board positions chosen from actualgames and were asked to reconstruct the position after each presentation.For the cued condition, half of the pieces (the cue set) were already inplace on the board when the participant began placing the rest of thepieces (the critical set). For the uncued condition, the board was empty ofpieces when the participant began reconstruction. Correct placement ofthe pieces in the critical set was measured and compared between thecued and uncued conditions. Results indicated that part-set cuing neitherfacilitated nor inhibited recall of the remainder of the pieces. It wasconcluded thatpart-set cuingisnot a sensitivetest of memoryorganization.In that study, however, the pieces chosen to be in the cue set weredetermined at random.It is possible that the way chessplayers organizeinformation into units or \"chunks\" (patterns or configurations of piecesaccording to how those pieces interact) was not utilized, and so animportant aspect of memory organization was not available to affect Huffman, Matthews. & Gagne PART-SET CUING537 recall of the critical set. Research on memory conducted with chessplayers has consistently found that experts remember more informationconcerning the position of pieces on a chessboard than novices, but onlywhen the positions resemble actual games (Chase & Simon, 1973).When pieces are placed on the board at random, experts do no better thannovices. Actual game positions provide experts with highly organizedinformation that facilitates recall, and that organization is unlikely tooccur with random positions. The importance of chunking in memory forchess-specific information has been established by numerous studies(e.g., Chase & Simon, 1973; Gobet & Simon, 1996; Holding, 1992;Simon & Gilmartin, 1973). Therefore, this study was designed to bemore sensitive to how part-set cuing could be affected by memoryorganization, by using chunks in the cue set, rather than choosing the cueset pieces at random as in Watkins et al. (1984). For example, if twopieces work together (such as a queen and bishop both aimed at theopponent's king), these pieces are likely to be organized in memorytogether as a chunk. In this study, these pieces both would be chosen aspart of the cue set or critical set, rather than allowing one to be in the cueset and the other to be in the critical set, which could happen whenrandom selection of pieces is used.METHODDesignThe design was a 2 X 2 factorial with level of expertise (experiencedor novice) manipulated between-subjects and cuing (cued or uncued)manipulated within-subjects. of expertise was manipulated todetermine if the part-set cuing procedure has an effect only on skilled,experienced players, who presumably have chess-specific informationbetter organized than less skilled players. Watkins, et al. (1984) in-corporated a second experiment with more experienced players to testthis possibility. The present study included both a novice group and anexperienced group in the same experiment in order to take into accountall of the variance in the analyses and detect a possible interactionbetween the two variables of expertise and cuing. Including level ofexpertise inthis experiment also provided a means for replicatingprevious studies of chess expertise and memory in which experts recalledmore pieces in game positions than novices (e.g., Chase & Simon, 1973).ParticipantsTwenty-four male chessplayers of various ages participated in theexperiment. Participants were either university students and/or membersof a community chess club. Half had experience playing in chesstournaments (the experienced group), and half had not played in 538NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY tournaments (the novice group). Those participants in the novice grouphad some playing experience, however, and knew enough basic rules andstrategies of the game to participate in this experiment. Those in theexperienced group had experience playing in rated chess tournamentsand, therefore, had skill ratings assigned by the United States ChessFederation (USCF). Their mean USCF rating was 1627 (see Elo, 1978for an explanation of the USCF rating system). Although not all par-ticipants in the experienced group were experts by USCF standards (arating of 2000 is required for expert status), two were experts and all hadratings above the national mean of 1184 (United States Chess Federation,1999). All would be expected to regularly defeat players in the novicegroup. Therefore, participants in the experienced and novice groupsdiffered in expertise as well as experience.MaterialsThe same chess positions were used in this experiment that were usedin Watkins, et al.'s (1984) study. The positions were from the first 10games described in an issue of the magazine \"Chess Life and Review\"published by the United States Chess Federation (1975, May). Thesegames were played by masters (USCF rating of 2200 or above). For eachof these games, the first position in which 24 of the original 32 piecesremained on the board was used. The positions were therefore realistic,sensible middle game placements of pieces. For each position, instead ofrandomly assigning the 24 pieces to be in either the critical or cue set (12in each set), as was done by Watkins et al. (1984), the 24 pieces werefirst divided into 12 \"chunks\" or pairs of pieces that cooperate inattacking the opponent's pieces or in defending their own. Typical chunkconfigurations consisted of king and rook in a castled position, queen andbishop both on the same diagonal aimed at the opponent's king, tworooks defending each other and controlling an open file, etc. These 12chunks were then randomly placed in either the cue set or critical set (6chunks per set).In this way the chunks were not split by allowing onepiece in a chunk to be placed in the cue set and the other in the criticalset, which can happen when random selection of pieces for each set isused.ProcedureParticipants were tested individually and were instructed to memorizeand then reconstruct the position of the pieces for each of the 10positions. They were told just to memorize the position of the pieces, notto generate possible moves. The 10 positions were presented in the sameorder to all participants. Each position was shown for 30 seconds, thenremoved from view and the participant immediately tried to reconstruct Huffman, Matthews. & Gagne PART-SET CUING539 the position just shown using another identical chessboard and pieces.On alternate positions, the response board contained half of the piecesalready in place (the cue set), and participants tried to place theremaining pieces (the critical set). This was the cued condition. For theother positions, the response board was empty and participants tried toplace all of the pieces.This was the uncued condition. For half of theparticipants, the odd numbered positions were presented in the cuedcondition and the even numbered positions were presented in the uncuedcondition. For the other half of the participants, the converse orderingwas used. In both conditions, participants were given a complete set of32 pieces, so that they had to choose the pieces as well as place them.There was no time limit to place the pieces, but for each position allparticipants indicated they were finished placing them within fourminutes.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFor each analysis the distribution normality assumption was testedusing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov procedure, and in each case the resultsindicated that the population was normally distributed, and thereforeparametric statistical tests were used. Of main interest was whether moreof the critical set of 12 pieces would be recalled in the cued conditionthan in the uncued condition. Therefore, the dependent measure for thisanalysis was the number of pieces correctly recalled in the critical set: theset of pieces not already placed on the response boards in the cuedcondition. See Table 1 for the results. As expected, there was a maineffect of expertise, F(1.22) =9.83, p<.01, with the more experienced playersrecalling significantly more pieces correctly than the novices. There wasno main effect of cuing, an interaction betweenexpertise and cuing, F(1,22)<1.The finding that the players in the experienced group recalled morepieces correctly thantheplayersinthenovice group not onlysubstantiates the expertise manipulation, but replicates previous studiesin which expert players recalled more pieces from actual game positionsthan novices (e.g., Chase & Simon, 1973). Although not relevant to thecomparison between the cued and uncued conditions of recall of criticalset pieces, the experienced group in the present study also recalled morecue set pieces in the uncued condition than the novice group, t=3.31,p<.01.The lack of a significant difference between the cued and uncuedconditions replicated Watson, et al. (1984) by finding that recall of thecritical set was not facilitated, nor inhibited, by presenting the cue setduring recall. This finding indicates that recall is not affected even whena method that is sensitive to how chess players organize information in 540NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY memory is used. This is consistent with other studies (Basden et al.,1991; Matthews, 1995) that indicate that part-set cue inhibition is lesslikely to be found in highly automatized tasks than in controlled,conscious tasks. TABLE 1 Mean Number of Critical Set Pieces per Position PlacedCorrectly (maximum=12) as a Function of Cuing Conditionand Level example, in Experiment 2, Basden et al. (1991) found that noinhibition occurred with part-set cuing on an indirect (i.e., implicit orunconscious) test when performance between a standard condition andthe indirect test condition was compared. This finding suggests that part-set cuing inhibition results from conscious influence. Additional supportfor this conclusion was provided by Matthews (1995), in which anattempt was made to link the inhibitory effect of part-set cues to eitherconscious or process dissociation(Jacoby,1991) and theindependence remember/know procedures(Jacoby, Yonelinas, & Jennings, 1997), estimates of conscious memorywere found to decrease in the presence of part-set cues, and the automaticestimates of memory were unaffected by the presence of part-set cues.Both dividing attention (Experiment 1) and delay (Experiment 2) reducedconscious but not automatic estimates of memory, thus strengthening theclaim that conscious processes were being manipulated while automaticprocesses were not. In the final experiment, a comparison of the effectsof part-set cues on explicit and implicit tests revealed the same pattern ofperformance as found in Experiments 1 and 2. That is, an inhibitoryeffect of part-set cuing was found with an explicit cued recall test (i.e., atest relying primarily on conscious memory processes) while such an545 Huffman, Matthews. & Gagne PART-SET CUING541 inhibitory effect was absent on an implicit test of memory (i.e., a testrelying primarily on automatic memory processes).The recall of chess positions by chess players presumably involves aprocess that becomes highly automatized with experience and thedevelopment of expertise in order for the player to allocate controlled,effortful processing to the task of choosing the best moves to win thegame. Consequently, if the recall of chess positions of expert playersdepends primarilyontherelativelyautomaticretrievalof pieceplacement information, then the lack of an inhibitory effect of part-setcuing on recallisexplainable. However, such an interpretation iscomplicated by the lack of an interaction between cuing and expertise.According to this explanation the novice group should have experiencedinhibition in the cued condition, because the organizational structurepresent in the game and detected by the better players presumably wouldnot be detected by the novices. The lack of such inhibition for thenovices perhaps was due to the complexity of the game itself, however.Although not nearly as good at playing the game as the experts, the\"novices\" in any study involving chess, nevertheless, have to be goodenough to perform rather complex tasks such as the memory task in thisstudy. Consequently, their chess skill may have developed beyond thepoint of being susceptible to inhibition from the presence of the type ofcue used in this study.REFERENCESBasden, B.H., Basden, D.R., Church, B.A., & Beaupre, P.

DateNameAddressCity StateZip 4 A Summary o OUT PhilosophyThe North American Journal of Psychology publishes scientificpapers that are of general interest to psychologists and other socialscientists. Papers may encompass a wide variety of topics, methods,and strategies. It is our belief that many good scientific papers arerejected for invalid reasons. Some journals reject up to 90% of theirsubmissions because they don't have space. Furthermore, studies ofthe review process strongly suggest that not all of the lucky 10% arebetter papers than those that get rejected. In our view many of thoserejected papers are meritorious with need for only minor revisions.Perhaps our philosophy can be summed up this way: we are lookingfor ways to strengthen good papers rather than searching for weakexcuses to reject them.
