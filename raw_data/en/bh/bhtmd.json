During Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, we reviewed a variety of critical areas relevant to the Department's mission priorities. One of our goals, for example, was to examine possibleprogrammatic improvements in Department operations relating to cyber security andcontract management. Overall, our efforts resulted in the issuance of over 70 audit andinspection reports containing recommendations for enhancing Departmental operations,with likely savings of over $7 million. Further as a result of our investigative efforts, weobtained 20 criminal convictions, recovered $22.8 million in fines, restitutions andsettlements, and, processed over 1,100 complaints and concerns from employees,contractors, and taxpayers regarding the Department and its functions. In the upcoming year, the OIG plans to focus its efforts on addressing other OIG-identified Management Challenges: safeguards and security, environmental cleanup, stockpilestewardship, and energy supply. No doubt, we will also be involved in the effort torestructure the IG community's governance model as called for in the Inspector GeneralReform Act of 2008. Among a number of initiatives, this includes the standing up of anew, unified, executive council for the IG community. We anticipate being directlyinvolved in this and a number of related activities. I am proud of the work of the IG staff. Despite evolving and new challenges, the Office of Inspector General remains committed to serving the American citizens by working withsenior management to advance the Department's national security mission. Gregory H. Friedman Inspector General U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERALi THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKTable of Contents Page Overview, ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERALiiiTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKOverview, Vision and Mission As mandated by the Inspector General Act of 1978 , as amended, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) promotes the effective operation of the Department of Energy (Department), including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This is accomplished through audits,investigations, and inspections designed to improve economy and efficiency and to detectand prevent fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement, and violations of law. As part of acollective effort, the OIG's goal is to ensure that the Department is: IFulfilling its program goals effectively; IUsing its resources efficiently in this pursuit; IOperating within the scope of its legislative mandates; IMeeting the President's Management Agenda; and, IAddressing Departmental priorities established by the Secretary. This report highlights the OIG's FY 2008 actual performance and FY 2009 planned activities. The goals, objectives, and strategies included in this document will be used toplan, measure and report on OIG results. This document includes the results of FY 2008audits, investigations, inspections, and special requested actions; constant efforts to improvethe OIG in alignment with the President's Management Agenda; the relationship betweenthe Department and the OIG; and, the plan to fund and accomplish FY 2009 goals.Appendices include the FY 2009 performance plan schedule, responsibilities,authorities and other mandates; the OIG organization; and, validation and verification ofOIG performance activities. Vision: To be a highly effective organization that promotes positive change by identifyingopportunities for improvements in the performance and efficiency of the Department'sprograms and operations. Mission: To promote the effective, efficient, and economical operation of the Department throughaudits, investigations, inspections, and other reviews to detect and prevent waste, fraud,abuse, and violations of law. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL1THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKMeasuring FY 2008 Performance Results In FY 2008, the OIG continued to make positive contributions to the Department'smission-related priorities. Some highlights of our work in FY 2008 include: I$7.1 million in recommendations that funds be put to better use; I$22.8 million in investigative fines, settlements, and recoveries; I20 criminal convictions; I42 suspensions and debarments; I1,131 hotline and inquiries I101 civil or administrative actions taken; and, IApproximately $142.6 million in potential recoveries from 14 open False Claims Act investigations. The OIG measures its performance against the long-term and annual goals set forth in OIG planning documents. During this reporting period, the OIG successfully achieved itsFY 2008 performance goals. In most instances, the OIG exceeded its goals. The followingare the specific results: Goal 1: Promote the President's Management Agenda and the Mission Priorities of the Secretaryand Congress. Objective 1: Conduct reviews seeking positive change in the Department relating to theimplementation of the initiatives in the President's Management Agenda, the Secretary'sPriorities, and the OIG-identified Management Challenges. Performance Measures: IConduct reviews as outlined in the OIG annual plan relating to: (1) the President's Management Agenda initiatives; (2) the Priorities; and,(3) the OIG-identified Management Challenges. Specifically: IComplete reviews that address each Presidential, Secretarial, and OIG-identified initiative, priority, and/or challenge as identified in FY 2007. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL3Accomplishment: Met Goal. The OIG completed reviews that addressed every Presidential, Secretarial, and OIG- identified initiative, priority, and/or challenge as identified in FY 2007. Performance auditswere initiated in several high profile areas - cyber security and the Loan Guarantee Program. During FY 2008, the Office of Audit Services conducted a total of 64 audits that addressed the President's Management Agenda, the Secretary's Mission Priorities, and OIG-identifiedManagement Challenges. For example, audits were conducted to determine whether: IThe Department's Y-12 site contractor had implemented surface contamination controls in accordance with its Chronic Beryllium Disease Prevention Program. IThe Department's long-term remediation actions at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos) would be completed in accordance with Consent Ordermilestones. IThe Department's planned disposition of its uranium-233 inventories would permit it to meet projected domestic medical and research needs for extremely rare isotopes thatare uranium-233 decay products. During FY 2008, the Office of Inspections and Special Inquiries completed 30 reviews that addressed the President's Management Agenda initiatives, the Secretary's Mission Priorities,and OIG-identified Management Challenges. For example, the following reviews wereconducted to determine whether: ISandia National Laboratory-New Mexico student interns received required training and used necessary personal protective equipment in order to work safely withlaboratory machinery, equipment, and hazardous materials. IThe Kansas City Plant had adequate internal controls over the use of purchase cards. IThe Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence had adequate internal controls for granting, maintaining, and terminating sensitive compartmented information accessauthorizations for Federal and contractor employees at Department headquarters. IThe Department had an adequate process for nominating known or suspected terrorists to a national watchlist maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation'sTerrorist Screening Center. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY4Measuring FY 2008 Performance ResultsMeasuring FY 2008 Performance Results Goal 2: Improve economy and efficiency and reduce waste, fraud, and abuse within the Department. Objective 2: Concentrate OIG efforts on issues that have the greatest impact and usefulness tothe Department. Performance Measures: IEnsure that every performance review includes an analysis of program accomplishments and the use of metrics to measure results. IEnsure that 57 percent of all performance audits include recommendations leading to demonstrable cost savings, program efficiencies, and/or funds put to better use. IComplete five follow-up reviews annually to determine the status and efficacy of corrective actions. IBy June 30, 2008, complete an annual risk-based programmatic assessment that considers OIG institutional knowledge; past program performance; funding levels;Presidential, Secretarial, and congressional concerns; and, input from Departmentprogram managers. IEnsure that each year 80 percent of all planned performance audits address high-risk areas as identified in the OIG annual risk-based programmatic assessments. IStrive for the Department to accept 79 percent of OIG report recommendations. Accomplishment: Met Goal. In FY 2008, all 39 performance audits completed included an analysis of program accomplishments and the use of metrics to measure results. The OIG was able to assist theDepartment in analyzing the operation of various programs and determining whether or notthose programs were effectively measuring their performance. For the performance audits issued, 69 percent identified demonstrable cost savings, program efficiencies and/or funds that can be put to better use in excess of $23 million.For example: IBased on our audit of \"Management Controls over Changes to the Idaho Cleanup Project Contract Baseline,\" OAS-M-08-10, the Department could potentially pay $4.3 million U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL5more in fees than necessary for environmental cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory if the contract baseline is not adjusted to reflect accurate estimates of workto be performed. IBased on our audit of \"Management Controls overOperations of the IntegratedDisposal Facility (IDF) at theHanford Site\" , there potential that $13 million bypostponing operations of the when the low-activitywaste generated at the WasteT reatment Plant will be availablefor disposal. IBased on our audit of \"Management Controls over Small Business Opportunities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,\" OAS-M-08-08, there is a potential for savings of about $2 million by expanding small business opportunities at the Laboratory for custodial,landscaping, and industrial hygiene services. Seven of the 39 performance audits completed were follow-up reviews to determine the status and efficacy of corrective actions. Fundamental to the annual audit planning process is conducting risk assessments and the development of audit profiles. The OIG considers all major contractor sites to be high risk.Other considerations include OIG institutional knowledge; past program performance;funding levels; and Presidential, Secretarial, and congressional concerns. By June 30, 2008,we completed risk-based programmatic assessments for each Department, NNSA andprogram activity. These risk assessments resulted in the identification of significant auditableentities at various Department locations. Another part of our audit planning process includesinput from Department management, other interested parties, and the OIG staff. Ninety-one percent of our planned performance audits addressed high-risk and sensitive areas identified in the OIG annual risk-based programmatic assessments. We also performed audits in response to congressional requests. For example, our \"Review of Alleged Conflicts of Interest Involving a Legal Services Contractor for the Yucca MountainProject License Application,\" DOE/IG-0792, was performed in response to a request from the State of Nevada congressional delegation. We reported that the procurement appeared tofollow the conflict of interest requirements set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulations,the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulations, and District of Columbia Bar Rules of OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY6Measuring FY 2008 Performance Results Construction of the Waste Treatment Plant at Hanford Site, Richland, WAMeasuring FY 2008 Performance Results Professional Conduct. However, we noted that the public interestwould have been better served hadthe Department done more todocument key decision pointsrelating to the procurement. Finally, there were 83 audit recommendations included in the39 performance audits conductedin FY 2008. The Departmentconcurred with 88 percent of ourrecommendations. The followingare summaries of positiveoutcomes resulting from three significant audits: IThe Department's Office of Health, Safety and Security revised DOE O 142.3, \"Unclassified Foreign Visits and Assignments Program,\" to better address theDepartment's process for reviewing access requests for nationals of state sponsors ofterrorism based on the results of an audit on \"The Department's Unclassified Foreign Visits and Assignments Program,\" DOE/IG-0791. IAfter an OIG audit of the \"Management of the Department's Publicly Accessible Websites,\" DOE/IG-0789, the Department Headquarters and field sites took corrective action to evaluate publicly accessible websites and consolidate them where appropriate.In addition, the Department also took action to actively control publicly accessiblewebsite development and postings at field locations. ILawrence Livermore National Laboratory began to develop and implement a project plan designed to improve safety tracking capability as a result of our report on\"Implementation of Integrated Safety Management at Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory,\" DOE/IG-0797. The Office of Inspections and Special Inquiries ensured that all 13 performance reviews completed included an analysis of program accomplishments and the use of metrics tomeasure results or documented that an analysis was not appropriate or required. Further, the Office of Inspections and Special Inquiries issued 19 inspection reports, which contained a total of 54 recommendations to management. The Department concurred with100 percent of the inspection recommendations. The following are examples of positiveoutcomes resulting from inspection recommendations: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL7 View of an exploratory tunnel at Yucca Mountain dug by a 25-foot-diame- ter tunnel boring machine.IThe Department's Oak Ridge Office completed a review of five facilities that sponsored or co-sponsored conferences during the period October 1, 2004, throughspring 2008 and recovered $330,001 in unallowable conference costs. The Oak RidgeOffice is also now ensuring that appropriate approvals are provided for conferencesand that they are included in the Department's Conference Management System. Inaddition, the Office of Science and NNSA recouped funds from inappropriate travelvoucher claims, and both issued additional guidance on this subject. IThe Sandia Site Office determined that $24,595 in charges made by employees using the procurement card program managed by Sandia National Laboratory-Californiawere for unallowable purchases or lacked the documentation necessary to determinetheir business necessity. As a result, these funds were recovered from the SandiaCorporation and returned to NNSA. NNSA also revised and issued a new writtenpolicy regarding the reimbursement of business meals and refreshments. IThe Material Control and Accountability program at Los Alamos National Laboratory has increased emphasis on standardized lot identification formulation and improvedlabeling methodologies that assist in differentiating material samples. This shouldfacilitate the tracking and inventorying of accountable nuclear material. IPortsmouth and Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plants implemented random drug testing for all armed personnel. INNSA (1) revised DOE O 151.1, \"Continuity Programs,\" to include a requirement for a pandemic plan at all Department facilities/operations and mandatory trainingrequirements and (2) during a 2008 Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) exercise,led a DOE-wide social distancing drill (e.g., use of teleworking) to test its ability toperform mission-essential functions while minimizing person-to-person contact. Inaddition, the Department's Office of Human Capital Management developed acorporate process, called \"Ring-Central,\" that enabled senior management to knowwho would be able to report to work during a pandemic. Ring-Central was testedacross the DOE complex during the 2008 COOP exercise. Further, the Office ofHuman Capital Management developed written procedures for the operation ofHeadquarters health clinics during a pandemic. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY8Measuring FY 2008 Performance ResultsMeasuring FY 2008 Performance Results Objective 3: Provide timely information to the Department so that prompt action can be taken to improve program performance. Performance Measures: IIssue 80 percent of audit reports no later that 60 days following receipt of management comments. IComplete the field work for 80 percent of inspections within 90 work days. IComplete the field work for 75 percent of special inquiries within 60 work days. IEnsure that the average time to issue Investigative Reports to Management (IRMs) is 55 days or less following final resolution of criminal and civil investigations. Accomplishment: Exceeded Goal. In FY 2008, 92 percent of the audit reports were issued within 60 days following receipt of management comments, providing timely information to Department management. The Office of Inspections and Special Inquiries completed the fieldwork for over 93 percent of its inspections within 90 work days. The following are examples of inspection findings: IWork order cost estimates provided between 2005 and 2007 by KSL Services Joint Venture (KSL), the support services contractor at Los Alamos, contained systemicproblems in that actual costs frequently exceeded estimates, often by significantamounts. In addition, KSL submitted labor and material charges that werequestionable, inappropriate, excessive, or unsupported based on the knowledge of thework performed. There were internal control weaknesses associated with Los Alamos'internal work order management system, which may have contributed to problemswith work order charges and costs. IHalf of the DOE Headquarters and field organizations required to submit a pandemic influenza implementation plan failed to meet a deadline set by the DOE ContinuityProgram Manager; coordination by the Department with individual State or Federalofficials for the release of pandemic vaccines had not been completed; a significantnumber of the required DOE pandemic committee technical advisory positions andthe Medical Officer position remained unfilled; DOE had not fully implemented anoverall corporate process for identifying and reporting employees who would beunable to perform their work during a pandemic; DOE had not conducted a \"socialdistancing\" drill to test its ability to perform mission-essential functions while U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL9minimizing person-to-person contact; and, only 550 of approximately 140,000 DOE and contractor employees received pandemic training. IAn allegation that unauthorized laptop computers were introduced into a Limited Area at the Y-12 National Security Complex was substantiated. An Oak RidgeNational Laboratory (Oak Ridge) employee brought an unclassified laptop computerinto a Y-12 Limited Area without following proper protocols; Y-12 cyber security staffdid not properly secure the laptop computer, allowing the user to depart with thecomputer; and, inconsistent with a 32-hour reporting requirement, a written report ofthe incident was not made to Headquarters until 6 days after it was discovered.Further, as many as 37 additional laptop computers may have been improperlyintroduced into the Limited Area in recent years. IThe Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence and its subordinate Field Intelligence Elements at Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) didnot have adequate administrative internal controls over their databases used to tracksensitive compartmented information (SCI) access authorizations. The Headquartersand local databases at Los Alamos and Sandia containing information regarding SCIaccess holders contained numerous errors, including incorrect database entries andfailures to update information relevant to SCI access. No special inquiries were initiated during this reporting period.The Office of Investigations issued IRMs, on average, 40 days following final resolution of criminal and/or civil action. Objective 4: Strengthen financial management and cyber security through completion ofmandatory reviews in accordance with Office of Management and Budget and otherapplicable requirements. Performance Measures: IComplete annually, by the established due date, the Department's consolidated financial statement audits to determine whether the financial statements are free frommaterial misstatement. IBy September 30, 2008, review the Department's unclassified information security system programs in accordance with the Federal Information Security ManagementAct of 2002. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY10Measuring FY 2008 Performance ResultsMeasuring FY 2008 Performance Results IInitiate 10 \"Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed\" audits annually to assess internal controls over costs claimed by the Department's major contractors. Accomplishment: Exceeded Goal. The OIG's audit of the Department's FY 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements resulted in an unqualified opinion that was issued on November 10, 2008. The audit found that theDepartment took a number of actions to improve controls over financial reporting duringFY 2008. These actions helped it resolve a significant deficiency with accounting forenvironmental liabilities that was identified during FY 2007 audit testing. While the extentof findings related to cyber security weaknesses had declined since FY 2007, the issue, asoutlined below, remained unresolved and continued to be identified as a significantdeficiency for FY 2008. We also completed reviews of the Department's unclassified information security systems in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 bySeptember 30, 2008. We found that the Department had taken steps to improve its cybersecurity program by strengthening configuration management of networks and systems andupdating local policies and procedures related to laptop computers and incident reporting.While the Department is taking steps to improve its cyber security program, additionalaction is required to reduce the risk of compromise to information systems and data. Wehave identified areas for improvement, including certification and accreditation of systems,systems inventory, contingency planning, and segregation of duties. Further, we initiated 15 Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed audits to determine whether the Department's integrated contractors were reimbursed for allowable costsconsistent with their contracts. Objective 5: Concentrate investigative efforts on allegations of criminal and civil violations of lawthat adversely impact major Department programs and operations, with emphasis onmaximizing the recovery of public resources and deterring future wrongdoing. Performance Measures: IAchieve an annual acceptance rate of 72 percent for cases presented for prosecutorial consideration. IEnsure 75 percent of all cases opened focus on key areas of Department vulnerability, specifically procurement and grant fraud, environmental violations, Qui T ams , or computer crimes. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL11Accomplishment: Goal Met. The OIG achieved a prosecutorial acceptance rate of 94 percent during this fiscal year. In addition, the OIG obtained 24 criminal indictments and 20 convictions, 1 pretrialdiversion, and 12 civil judgments. Of the cases opened in FY 2008, 75 percent focused onkey areas of vulnerability in the Department. Examples of successes as a result of OIG investigations include: IFollowing an OIG investigation, the U. S. Department of Justice announced a significant civil settlement with the Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC),formerly a major Department of Energy contractor. WSRC agreed to pay$2.4 million to resolve allegations of fraud involving WSRC's failure to disclose\u2014during contract negotiations\u2014material information regarding pension fund increasesat the Savannah River Site. The failure to disclose updated actuarial information,which WSRC had in its possession at the time of the negotiations, had the net effectof making additional monies available to WSRC for award fees. Had WSRC madeproper disclosures, the company would have earned $1.2 million in award fees. The$2.4 million settlement represents double damages and fines. In addition, WSRCagreed to withdraw a pending fee claim of at least $35.67 million for administeringthe increased pension cost. The combined settlement and cost savings totals at least$38 million. IAn OIG investigation determined that a former contractor to the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) paid out over $390,000 in gratuities to current and formeremployees at WAPA's Desert Southwest Regional Office. The payments were made inexchange for the employees providing their assistance in getting the contractor a$1.2 million contract award. Five individuals pled guilty and received sentencesranging from five years probation to five months in prison. They were also ordered topay restitution ranging from $40,864 to $79,958. In addition, four individualsinvolved in the scheme were debarred from Government contracting for three years. IAn OIG investigation determined that a grantee made three false statements when he claimed expenses totaling $62,675 that he did not incur. The grantee, a retiredFederal agent, was found guilty on three counts of false statements and two counts ofwire fraud. He was sentenced to eight months home detention and ordered to payfines and restitution in the amount of $41,000. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY12Measuring FY 2008 Performance ResultsMeasuring FY 2008 Performance Results Objective 6: Coordinate with other law enforcement agencies to establish effective networks in order to identify areas that are most vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse. Performance Measure: IEnsure 25 percent of all cases opened are joint agency/task force investigations with external law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation andother OIGs. Accomplishment: Exceeded Goal.The OIG opened 118 cases during FY 2008; 42 percent of which were joint agency task force investigations. The following are examples of successes from joint agency task forceinvestigations: IA multi-agency task force, where we serve in the lead role, is investigating allegations that information technology companies entered into alliance agreements with eithersystem integration consultants or technology vendors to: 1) Receive fees/rebates when they referred the Government to the consultants to get Government contracts; 2) Receive fees when assisting other consultants or vendors to get Government contracts; or 3) Receive fees when hardware/software was purchased by the Government. The investigation has determined that these alliance agreements, and the corresponding fees, should have been revealed to the Government. To date,three Government IT contractors have entered into settlement agreements totaling$6.5 million. The investigation is ongoing, and settlements with other companiesare on the horizon. IA joint OIG investigation determined that the owner and an employee of an information technology sales company misrepresented and sold \"gray\" market and counterfeitnetworking and computer equipment to the Department of Energy and the Departmentof Defense. The owner and the employee of the company both pled guilty to one countof conspiracy to defraud the Government. The owner was sentenced to 5 months homeconfinement, 2 years probation, and 200 hours of community service, and, ordered topay approximately $46,995. The employee was sentenced to 2 years probation, 200hours community service, and was ordered to pay $5,452 in fines and restitution. Also,the company, the owner, and the employee were debarred from Government contracting. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL13IA task force investigation with other law enforcement agencies determined that a Department subcontractor improperly discharged 400,000 gallons of wastewater froma holding pond at a national security facility, knowing that it contained contaminants,including certain radionuclides. The action endangered the health and welfare ofDepartment of Energy employees and surrounding communities. The investigationresulted in a criminal guilty plea, penalties and fines of $300,000 and a $15 millionsettlement with the rouge subcontractor. Objective 7: Heighten awareness of potential fraud among internal and external customers. Performance Measure: IProvide 28 fraud awareness briefings annually to Department and contractor employees and managers. Accomplishment: Exceeded Goal.The OIG investigative personnel conducted 47 fraud awareness briefings in FY 2008. These presentations are designed to discuss the process for reporting fraud, waste, andabuse to the OIG and to highlight priorities and initiatives of the Office of Investigations.In FY 2009, the OIG will continue to concentrate its efforts on educating the communityto potential fraud indicators as a means of deterring fraud, waste, and abuse. Goal 3: Support the Taxpayer Objective 8: Provide the Department and the public with an effective and efficient mechanism toreport waste, fraud, and abuse. Performance Measures: IOperate the OIG Hotline in a manner that ensures 85 percent of Hotline complaints warranting further action begin processing within 7 days of receipt. IForward 85 percent of the complaints identified for referral to Department or other agency management within 14 days of initiation of the case. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY14Measuring FY 2008 Performance ResultsMeasuring FY 2008 Performance Results Accomplishment: Exceeded Goal One hundred percent of predicated Hotline complaints, which are those determined to warrant further action, began processing within 7 days of receipt, and 100 percent ofcomplaints identified for referral were processed within 14 days of initiation of the case.During the year, the OIG Hotline received 2,763 contacts, of which 1,131 warrantedfurther processing as complaints/allegations; 334 of those items were predicated; and,157 were referred to Department management and other Government agencies, of which79 requested a management response. Objective 9: Make the public aware of OIG reports. Performance Measure: IEnsure that all OIG public reports that were identified for inclusion on the Internet are posted within three working days of submission to the Secretary, unless otherwisespecified by the Inspector General. Accomplishment: Met goal. All public reports were posted within three work days and an early alert system provided approved subscribers advance notification of the release of the reports. Objective 10: Provide a structure for ensuring a skilled and efficient workforce. Performance Measures: IEnsure that all auditors meet the training requirements as specified by generally accepted Government Auditing Standards. IEnsure that all investigators meet the training requirements as specified by Federal law enforcement and other related investigative standards. IEnsure that all inspectors meet the training requirements as specified by the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency \"Quality Standards for Inspections.\" U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL15OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY16Measuring FY 2008 Performance Results Accomplishment: Met goal. Auditors, inspectors, and investigators all met their training requirements including those prescribed by statute. The OIG's established training requirements to ensure that auditors,investigators, and inspectors receive required or otherwise appropriate training for theirspecialty. These requirements are stated in each employee's individual development plan.Each organization designated a training coordinator position to: (1) monitor the allocationand use of training funds; (2) ensure required training is scheduled and completed;(3) integrate developmental and training requirements into the planning process; and,(4) ensure employees have individual development plans. Objective 11: Provide a process to ensure that the most qualified internal and external candidates arereferred for positions. Performance Measures: IEnsure a diverse, skilled talent pool for selection of new hires through the use of appropriate recruitment resources. Accomplishment: Met goal.The OIG recruited entry level positions at colleges with high numbers of minority students and especially canvassed universities in the southwestern United States that have highnumbers of Hispanic students. This is the first year the OIG participated in cyber job fairs,which should open job opportunities to an even wider audience. Also, our use of theFederal Career Intern Program allows the recruiters to better target minority candidates. Relationship with the Department of Energy The work of the OIG continues to focus on the vital areas stated in the Department'sstrategic plan. The Department's strategic themes of energy security, nuclear security, scientific discovery and innovation, environmental responsibility, and managementexcellence are key areas for OIG reviews and investigations. The OIG aligns its reviewsalong the same themes, with emphasis on key challenges facing the Department. The OIGidentification of key challenges brings an even sharper delineation of issues for departmentalfocus. The following are the OIG-identified Management Challenges for FY 2009: IContract and IStockpile Stewardship ICyber Security IEnergy Supply In addition to responding to requests for special reviews or investigations from the Secretary and Congress, the OIG continuously performs reviews at the Department through variousplanned audits and inspections. OIG Strategic Goal The OIG's strategic goal is to perform a robust review program that provides timely,relevant performance information and recommendations to improve the Department'sprograms in relation to: 1. The President's Management Agenda; 2. The Secretary's priorities; and, 3. OIG-identified Management Challenges. To ensure the integrity of the Federal and contractor workforce, the OIG completes statutory mandates, recovers monies, and provides opportunities for savings. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL17THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKFY 2009 Funding Priorities OIG Funding by Strategic Goal The OIG focuses its resources toward the most significant mission-related priorities and challenges facing the Department. The OIG's overarching strategic goal supports theDepartment's mission priorities and the President's Management Agenda. Strategic Goal FY 2008 FY 2009 FY Appropriated Requested Pre-conference The OIG's Strategic $46.1 $51.9 $51.9 Goal is to operate a robust review million million million program and provide timelyperformance information andrecommendations to facilitatethe Department's efforts to:(1) the Secretary's priorities; and,(4) ensure the integrity of theFederal and contractor ensuring that the OIGcompletes statutory mandates,recovers monies, and providesopportunities for savings. The OIG started FY 2009 under a six-month continuing resolution with funding held to FY 2008 levels. This action resulted in a temporary decrease of staffing and a decrease infunds available for travel and training requirements. If the full FY 2009 appropriationrequest is received, the additional funding will help to ensure that the OIG continues tosuccessfully meet its statutory requirements; and conducts independent audits,investigations, inspections, and other reviews of the Department's programs in a timelyand efficient manner.

OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY20FY 2009 Funding PrioritiesFY 2009 Funding Priorities Critical Outside Influences Each year, the OIG is requested to conduct quick turnaround, unplanned, and resource intensive reviews. These requests directly impact the OIG's workload, formulating budgets,evaluating procedures, and establishing priorities. Examples include: Secretarial/Congressional Priorities. Emerging mission-related priorities require the Secretary to request the OIG to conduct related reviews. Also, the OIG regularly receivesrequests from various members of Congress and their staffs to conduct reviews and provideinformation and to participate in briefings and hearings. These requests are usuallyunanticipated and require immediate attention. Satisfying these requests often affects theOIG's progress in achieving its strategic planning goals. New Statutory Requirements. New legislative mandates and unfunded audit, investigative, inspection, or special inquiry requirements divert resources away from other critical areas,including evaluating the performance of the Department's programs and operations as theyrelate to the President's Management Agenda, the Secretary's mission priorities, and themost serious management challenges facing the Department.

Inthe coming year, the OIG will focus and align its resources and planned activities in supportof these areas: Energy Security - Promoting America's energy through reliable, clean, and affordable energy. The Department is committed to minimizing supply disruptions that pose a threat to theU.S. economy and national security and aims to increase the attractiveness of advancedenergy sources in the marketplace, which could help reduce dependence on foreign sourcesof energy and diversify the Nation's electricity supply. As the demand for energy in the U.S.may possibly exceed the projected increase in domestic energy production, the Department U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL27continues to explore various technologies that will import more energy, improve energy conservation and efficiency, and/or increase domestic supply. Such technologies includerenewable energy sources (including hydropower, wind, solar, bioenergy and geothermal),nuclear energy, oil, natural gas, and coal. Nuclear Security -Ensuring America's nuclear security. A primary responsibility of the Department is to enhance national security through the application of nuclear technology. This is accomplished through the maintenance of theU.S. nuclear weapons stockpile; the development of responsive infrastructure that can adaptquickly to stockpile changes while drawing down the stockpile of weapons excess to defenseneeds; the security of the nuclear complex and strengthening of international nuclearnonproliferation controls; the reduction in global danger from weapons of mass destruction;the provision to the U.S. Navy of safe, effective nuclear propulsion systems; and, operationof its national laboratories. Scientific Discovery and Innovation - Strengthening U.S. scientific discovery, economic competitiveness, and improving quality of lifethrough innovation in science and technology. To remain competitive with other nations and achieve the major scientific discoveries thatwill drive U.S. competitiveness, the Department endeavors to achieve major scientificadvances on the most critical basic research programs in physical sciences. The Departmentinvests in high-risk, high-value energy research and development that the private sectoralone would not or could not develop in a market driven economy. These technologies willallow the major scientific discoveries that will revolutionize approaches to the Nation'senergy, national security, and environmental quality challenges. Environmental Responsibility - Protecting the environment by providing a responsible resolution to the environmental legacy ofnuclear weapons productions. The Department seeks to research and employ the necessary environmental infrastructurethat will ensure a clean and safe environment for future generations. This is implementedthrough the cleanup of the contaminated nuclear weapons manufacturing and testing sitesand the management of the post-closure environmental responsibilities while ensuring thefuture protection of human health and the environment. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY28FY 2009 Annual Performance PlanFY 2009 Annual Performance Plan Management Excellence - Enabling the mission through sound management. The mission of the Department is enabled through the work of good managementprocesses performed by its major program and staff offices. The Department's Federalworkforce is aging and presenting a significant retirement challenge that threatens to robthe organization of critical skills needed to perform its mission. A highly technical andspecialized workforce is required to accomplish scientific and technological missions thusincreasing competition for individuals with the knowledge, skills, and competencies thatsupport the Department's goals. The Department seeks to facilitate sound managementthrough (1) improving business processes, (2) technological advancement, (3) assetaccountability; and, (4) strengthening human capital. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL29THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANKOffice of Audit Services The Office of Audit Services (OAS) provides internal and contracted audit activities for Department programs and operations, including the NNSA. The Office strives to provide reliable, credible financial and performance information to senior management, theCongress, and the taxpayers. The Office is organizationally aligned with the Department'sprogrammatic lines in national security and energy; as well as in environment, science,financial, technology, and corporate operations. The Office will concentrate its efforts oneconomy, efficiency and program reviews, while maintaining sound oversight of thefinancial statement audit. This organizational structure helps to ensure that audit workprovides comprehensive coverage over Department organizations, programs, and operationswhile meeting the Department's evolving needs. The Office uses a risk-based process for identifying areas for audit coverage. Specific areas with known or emerging risks and the greatest vulnerabilities are identified. This processleads to conducting program performance reviews that address the President's ManagementAgenda; the Department's Strategic Themes and Goals; OIG-identified managementchallenges; as well as congressional interests. A significant portion of audit resources isdirected toward meeting OIG statutory audit responsibilities in the financial andinformation technology areas. The OAS has scheduled 76 performance audits to start in FY 2009. Many non- discretionary taskings from external sources impact the OAS workload and may requirepostponement or cancellation of planned audits to accommodate these demands. Followingis a summary of the audits' objectives that are scheduled to begin in FY 2009, grouped bythe Department's Business Lines. The planned audit workload is summarized later inthis plan.

Priority is given to investigations of suspected violations of criminal and civil statutes, as well as seriousadministrative misconduct. Criminal Investigators within OI work closely with Departmentof Justice (DOJ) prosecutors and other Federal, State and local law enforcementorganizations utilizing a full range of law enforcement authorities, such as carrying firearms,applying for and executing search warrants, and making arrests. The work of OI, however,extends beyond the conduct of investigations - namely, the office identifies opportunitiesfor improving the economy and efficiency of Department programs and operations byissuing reports that recommend positive change. OI's accomplishments are measured byrecommendations accepted by management, investigations accepted for prosecutive action,cooperative efforts with other law enforcement agencies, and proactive initiatives. Throughaccomplishments in those areas, the office plays a major role in assisting the OIG inpromoting the efficient, effective, and economical operation of the Department,including NNSA. National Program Area Initiative The work performed by OI is primarily reactive in nature and has the potential of reachinginto any Department major program area, including NNSA. The establishment of theNational Program Area Initiative has afforded OI the opportunity to identify program areasin the Department most vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse and to proactively dedicate asignificant portion of investigative resources, to include special agent training, liaisondevelopment, and specialized studies, to those program areas. OI's National Program AreaInitiative concentrates on four areas, which are also tied into the Department's strategicthemes as identified in the 2008 Strategic Plan. The four areas are: (1) contract and grantfraud; (2) environment, safety, and health (ES&H) violations; (3) Qui T ams ; and (4) technology crimes. One of OI's goals is to have 75 percent of its open investigations addressat least one of the four areas. In FY 2009, work on the National Program Area Initiativewill continue to move forward as plans are implemented and expanded. Contract and Grant Fraud During FY 2008, OI continued to identify and interact with key Department and NNSAprocurement personnel, as well as conduct fraud awareness briefings with special emphasison procurement and grant fraud. A majority of the Department's budget is expended oncontracts and grants; therefore, the opportunity for fraud to occur or exist within various U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL39Department programs is significant. Given the continuing potential for significant fraud, to include potential fraud in the Department's Loan Guarantee Program, and the Department'sresponsibility to oversee the $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicle Loan Program, inFY 2009, OI will continue to: (1) expand fraud awareness briefings throughout theDepartment, including NNSA; (2) prioritize contract and grant fraud investigations,placing emphasis on cases with a potential high dollar recovery to the Department; (3) workwith established contract and grant task forces, and identify opportunities to establish newtask forces with DOJ involvement; (4) coordinate and pursue leads referred by the OIGOffices of Audit Services and Inspections and Special Inquiries; and, (5) identify and pursuecontract and grant fraud investigations proactively. An example of success in the grantfraud arena is as follows: IA joint OIG investigation determined that an employee of a grantee contractor mailed false and fraudulent invoices to a Department grant recipient and received $608,459to which he was not entitled. The employee, along with other co-conspirators,devised and participated in a scheme to defraud the Department and receive kickbackson contracts where no work was completed. The employee pled guilty in theNorthern District of Illinois to a violation of Mail Fraud. Sentencing is pending. Environment, Safety, and Health The Department's program for cleaning up the environmental contamination caused bynuclear weapons research, production, and testing is estimated to cost over $200 billion overthe next several decades. With the end of the Cold War, the mission to clean up theenvironment has become more essential as a result of more than 50 years of nuclear defensework and energy research. The OIG has identified environmental cleanup as one of threeDepartment FY 2009 management challenges that is likely to persist well into the future.OI's ES&H program area supports the Department's Environmental Responsibility strategictheme. Ensuring the safety and health of the public and the Department's workers is a toppriority. In FY 2009, OI will continue to: (1) work with established ES&H task forces,(2) identify opportunities to establish new task forces; and, (3) develop and maintain ES&Hcontacts in the Department, NNSA, and other Government agencies. Qui T ams As a rule, Qui T am -related allegations are complex and staff-hour intensive. As of September 30, 2008, OI had 14 open Qui T am investigations with claims alleging fraud of $142.6 million. These investigations often have a major impact on the Department andgenerally involve significant allegations of fraud involving millions of dollars and multipleFederal agencies. OI continues to work closely with the DOJ's Commercial LitigationBranch in the investigation and analysis of Qui T am cases. Following, is an example of a successful OIG Qui T am investigation: OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY40Office of InvestigationsOffice of Investigations IA joint investigation determined that a body armor manufacturer knowingly participated in the manufacturing and sale of defective body armor containing Zylon.The body armor company sold the defective body armor to the Department as well asto other Federal, State, local and tribal law enforcement agencies. The companyinvolved agreed to pay a total of $15 million to resolve allegations that it violated theFalse Claims Act. In FY 2009, OI will continue to: (1) assist DOJ in investigating and providing analysis of Qui T am cases; (2) adjust resources appropriately to ensure priority Qui T am cases are being resolved in a timely manner; and, (3) identify specific Qui T am training for OI personnel. Technology Crimes Information Technology, another of the Department's major issue areas, received a significant amount of OI's resources and attention during FY 2008. OI's TechnologyCrimes Section (TCS) is staffed by investigators with the specialized skills necessary toproactively and reactively investigate the expanding number of complex technology crimesthat are occurring within many of the Department's programs. TCS further strengthensOI's support to the Department, including NNSA, in detecting, preventing, andinvestigating illegal network intrusions. Utilization of such a group is critical because of therisks and vulnerabilities on the rise (i.e., security breaches, computer systems intrusions,virus attacks, and employee misuse). In FY 2008, TCS provided technical expertise onstandard fraud cases. Additionally, TCS investigations led to several criminal convictionsagainst individuals who compromised Government computers or misused them by accessingor storing sexually explicit material to include child pornography. An example of a recentsuccess is as follows: IA Romanian hacker was convicted by a Romanian court for hacking into unclassified Department of Energy computers, as well as systems at the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration and the Department of the Navy. The investigation revealedthat the Romanian had compromised at least 22 unclassified computers at4 Department laboratories, including systems at a weapons laboratory (Sandia). Thesubject illegally gained access to the computers by stealing user names and passwordsfrom academic personnel at various universities that also have access to Departmentcomputers. The Romanian is awaiting sentencing. During FY 2009, TCS will: (1) continue to proactively contribute to and support fraud investigations through consultations and forensic media analysis; (2) investigate incidents oftechnology crimes and non-compliance with applicable regulations involving protection ofthe information infrastructure throughout the Department; (3) clarify and extend OI's rolein technology incident response and investigations in the Department; (4) ensure all TCSspecial agents continue to receive required technical training; and, (5) refine and providetechnology crimes awareness briefings throughout the Department complex. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL41Proactive Work Historically, OI's response to allegations of wrongdoing has been reactive in nature. However, OI succeeded in implementing a process that streamlined and formalizedproactive case development with a targeted approach designed to ensure more efficient andeffective use of resources. OI will continue its pursuit of proactive initiatives designed to effect positive change within the Department and enhance OI's ability to meet organizational goals and objectives. Closeattention will be paid to OI's infrastructure needs to ensure adequate skills, tools, andprocesses are in place to respond promptly and appropriately to emerging priority issuesidentified by the President, Secretary, Congress, and public. Partnerships with otherestablished law enforcement agencies, Department managers, and employees will beexpanded, and productive sources of information will be further cultivated. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY42Office of InvestigationsOffice of Inspections The Office of Inspections conducts performance and allegation-based inspections, as well as special inquiries in response to concerns raised by Congress, senior managers of the Department, and others. The Office also manages the OIG Hotline and ManagementReferral Systems. The Office facilitates management reform in the Department byevaluating and providing recommendations to improve program performance. Although the Office plans a portion of its annual inspection work, it retains flexibility in order to be able to promptly address concerns and allegations received during the course ofthe year. The Office of Inspections initiated an annual average of 15 allegation-basedinspections over the last 4 years. When planning its performance inspection work, theOffice identifies and prioritizes topics responsive to the President's Management Agenda, theSecretary's Mission Priorities, and the Department's Management Challenges as identified bythe OIG. Inspections are initiated with consideration given to their significance andpotential impact on Department programs and operations. In light of current heightenedconcerns over homeland security, the Office is focusing its resources to address critical safetyand security issues affecting programs and operations throughout the Department.
