She knew intuitively choosing essential oils was a wise life-style. Her solution was to open a Massage Therapy Studio that integrated essential oils and allowed her time to build business knowledge and awareness in the community. Nearly three decades later, Rose has gained both personally and professionally from using essential oils. By developing hundreds of formulas and blends, she's created healthier lives and helped clients learn to love their skin again. "}
