Keep those Fins Up! Dr. J Dr. Tara Jungersen Department and Counseling Concentration Updates Hello, Sharks! My name is Julie Lillis and I graduat ed from Nova in 2008 after completing the master's program in mental health counseling. I did my internshi p at Children's Home Society, a group home for runaway teens. During my time there, I was responsible for holding daily group therapy sessions, completing intakes, and providing individual counseling. I learned a lot from that experience and really enjoyed working with the kids. Upon graduating, I began working as a mental health counselor at an agency that I was already employed with as a case manager. This agency offered in home services, which was interesting, but not sustainable for me long term due to travel time and demand. After that, I took a job at a juvenile correctional facility and had a caseload of 14 adolescent boys. The pap erwork was extensive, which helped sharpen my clinical documentation skills. I also got the chance to build strong alliances with my clients because I was seeing them every day. Eventually I made the leap to private practice. I worked for a group practice for a short time and I now run my own group practice with eight contract employees. Private practice has given me the freedom and flexibility to hone my skills and expand my education. I have become certified in CBT through the Beck Institute's online prog ram. I have also completed all three levels of Gottman Method Couples Therapy clinical training. For new graduates, I would recommend working in an agency to start. The structured environment offers support and resources for new therapists. There is alway s a supervisor on site and you can build relationships with colleagues that have different levels of experience. The pitfalls are the extensive and mundane paperwork, the hours, and lack of flexibility in your schedule. I have found private practice to be an amazing experience for me because you can be more selective in the clients you work with. However, if you are not a business minded person, I would highly recommend working for a group practice. I learned the hard way that the time and money you will s pend running your business is equivalent to the percentage you would pay to a group practice. Private practice can also be lonely, so I would recommend joining a supervision group online or loca lly. I'm wishing you success ! ~ Analysis The BACB is excited to introduce the new Ethics Code for Behavior Analysts . This updated Code for BCBAs and BCaBAs will go into effect on January 1, 2022 .

I proudly hail from Baltimore, MD. (Go Ravens!!) and proudly wear my purple an d gold while eating my crab cakes and crabs! I recently moved from Virginia before heading to sunny South Florida. I was attracted to NSU due to the rich diversity, emphasis on building community, community engagement, well -rounded student -centered faculty and commitment to providing access to quality education through various teaching formats. My passion is teaching students beyond theory towards practical clinical application that they can utilize in real world situations. I aim to make seemingly comp lex concepts understandable and applicable. I am always excited when I receive student feedback indicating new found comprehension and confidence. Of utmost importance to me is that my students understand and embrace their individuality and honor their uni que strengths as this will allow them to trust themselves and their ability to enact change within the lives of others. In addition to my counseling interests of mentorship, self -care and spirituality, to name a few, I embrace holistic wellness in its many forms. I am certified as a Mindfulness -Based Transformational Life Coach, Yoga Nidra Master Teacher, Meditation Teacher, Reiki Master and Certified Sound Healing Professional. I also enjoy reading as well as practicing mindful meditation and wellness activities in my spare time.

I travel a lot in my spare time, en joy crafting and eating my favorite food, sushi! ~Cierra Davis, Ph.D., NCC , LPC Mental health is becoming a more popular topic in the media.

I earned my bachelor 's in psychology and a minor in sociology from University of North Florida (UNF).

The experience provided the unique opportunity to observe many facets and functionality of a private practice while observing individual and group counseling sessions. I also took part in partnered research that was presented on our local news. These experiences led me to pursue my master 's degree in counseling at Nova. My favorite experience so far was the Residential Institute weekend and I am looking forward to more hands -on experience with my practicum and internship. I am member of FMHCA, AMHCA and Psi Chi. My future aspirations are to work with adults on an individual, couples, and group counseling capacity.
