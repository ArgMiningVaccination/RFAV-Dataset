Opt for unrefined complex carbs to maintain weight. On the other hand, a quicker-acting sugar may be needed for extra energy and endurance, such as that for long-distance running or cycling. Q: Any tips for adding complex carbs to my diet? A: Eat fruits and veggies as your snacks. This steers you away from processed, packaged snacks and their added sugars. Q: How do carbs help with workouts or tness goals? A: If your goal is performance, your body needs the fuel provided by carbs, which should be consumed before and maybe even during your workout. But if weight loss is your goal, you may need to cut back on carbs. For a personal recommendation, reach out to your local Hy-Vee dietitian. KNOW YOUR W UR Q: What are carbohydrates? A: They 're the sugars, starches and fibers found in fruits, grains, vegetables and milk products, and they are vital in providing the body with glucose for energy. The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbs, especially complex carbs, make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. Q: What's the di erence between simple and complex carbohydrates? A: Simple carbs have short- chain molecules; examples are sucrose (table sugar), fructose and other sweeteners often added to processed foods. Complex carbs are strung together in long, more complicated chains and hav e fiber, vitamins and minerals. Vegetables, fruit, beans, peas and whole grains are complex carbs . Q: Why eat complex carbs? A: Typically found in plant foods, complex carbs contain fiber, vitamins and minerals that your body needs. 9 BALANCE | hy-vee.comPHOTO Greg Scheidemann PHOTO www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/carbohydrates--good-or-bad-for-you http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2011/mar/how-the-body-uses-carbohydrates-proteins-and-fats.htmlFUEL UP MOST OF THE BODY CAN DERIVE ENERGY FROM ALL THREE MACRONUTRIENTS\u2014 CARBOHYDRATES, PROTEIN AND FATS \u2014 BUT THE BRAIN PREFERS FUEL FROM CARBS.

WHEN YOU PRACTICE GOOD ORAL HYGIENE HABITS YOU 'LL BE REWARDED WITH A HEALTHY MOUTH. HEALTHY LIVINGPHOTOS Greg Scheidemann and Tobin BennettI'm always amazed at the array of dental products available in the grocery and pharmacy aisles. It 's reassuring to see so much ammunition in the fight for a healthy smile. We should all take advantage of the dental brushes, tools, pastes and other products and follow these tips from the American Dental Association (ADA). Brush twice a day for 2 minutes with a fluoride toothpaste. Fluoride helps build minerals on teeth to resist decay. Use a soft-bristle brush with a small-enough head to reach throughout your mouth. Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gums and gently move it back and forth in short strokes overall surfaces. Tilt the brush vertically and use up-and-down strokes to clean inside surfaces of front teeth. Consume some fluoride. When children consume it through foods, drinking water and supplements, fluoride makes their tooth enamel stronger even before their baby teeth break through. After teeth grow, fluoride helps rebuild enamel lost from plaque acids. For adults, fluoride in toothpastes, mouthwashes and professional applications helps rebuild weakened tooth enamel. Floss or use dental picks between teeth once a day, as recommended by the ADA, to remove plaque and food particles. Interdental brushes, floss threaders or a water flosser can help those with braces, bridges or other dental work. Glide floss between teeth and gently rub. Also slide it between the gum and the tooth and gently rub. Always use an ADA- accepted fluoride toothpaste unless your dentist advises otherwise. Toothpaste types abound: those that whiten, those for sensitive teeth, pastes with plaque-fighting ingredients, and fluoride ones for fighting cavities. Beyond brushing and flossing daily, eat healthfully and limit sugary snacks and drinks to avoid cavities. And see a dentist regularly \u2014preferably twice a year\u2014to prevent and treat decay and gum disease.

NOW HE'S TAKING ON THE BOARDROOM AND SETTING HIS SIGHTS ON CHANGING THE WORLD THROUGH STORYTELLING. FIND OUT WHAT LIFE AFTER BASKETBALL MEANS FOR THIS LOS ANGELES LAKERS LEGEND AND ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME. \"Basketball is life,\" Kobe Bryant says. \"It's been my obsession since I was six years old.\" From an early age, Bryant, who now leads his own media production company, Granity Studios, has always been a student of details. He pored over VHS tapes of professional basketball players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and other greats to learn their methods and moves. Basketball is in his blood\u2014he's the son of former professional basketball player Joe \" Jellybean\" Bryant\u2014 and because he spent his younger years growing up in Italy, he had limited access to American television. So to feed his interest, Bryant's grandfather would mail him tapes, giving him a foundation for developing his game. Basketball was Kobe's constant interest, a subject to master through focused study and practical application. He drilled and practiced endlessly, growing his skills so rapidly that after he and his family moved to Philadelphia, and he finished high school, he turned professional at 18. Showing controlled yet intense play, Bryant quickly gained a reputation for being fiercely competitive while still learning from his opposition. \"As a basketball player, you need to sacrifice a lot if you want to be the best. It takes dedicated focus, which means time away from family and friends,\" Bryant says. \"You need to surround yourself with people who support your vision and encourage you to work hard.\" In twenty seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, Bryant compiled one of the best careers in the history of professional basketball. He won five championships, made 18 all-star appearances and finished third all-time on the league scoring list. \"My inspiration was always to be the best, silence the doubters and crush the competition,\" Bryant says. \"Now that I've retired from WORDS Aaron Ventling PHOTO Derek Reed/NY Daily News/Contour by Getty Images 33 BALANCE | hy-vee.com\"I'M EXTREMELY PASSIONATE ABOUT WRITING.

His superstar status provided him access to some of the best entrepreneurs and content creators in the world through marketing campaigns and product endorsements. Once again, Bryant saw an opportunity to study the greats. Bryant started his own investment management company, Kobe Inc., with which he later developed his own media production company, Granity Studios, as a passion project to share inspiring and educational stories through a variety of media, including books, films and television series. \"I'm one hundred percent focused on building my content studio and telling original stories that teach the next generation of athletes how to reach their full potential ... There's no point to my career if I don't share my journey with others, so they can be greater than I ever was,\" Bryant says. \"We're creating original characters\u2014all with different ethnicities and genders\u2014who will confront different challenges and emotions. My dream is that these stories will tee young people up for success.\" Bryant's journey off the court is just beginning, but he's already making headlines in his new profession. In early 2018, he won an Academy Award for Dear Basketball , an animated short adapted from a poem he wrote about his life and career. Partnering with ESPN, Bryant launched Detail , a streaming series on ESPN+ in which he analyzes individual professional basketball players and teams to provide deeper insight to fans. And if Bryant wasn't busy enough, his autobiography, The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, will be released this fall. Just like his playing days, Bryant continues to be a student of details. \"I want to continue to break the mold\u2014to do things that have never been done before. \" I'M EXTREMELY PASSIONATE ABOUT WRITING. PEOPLE CAN TOUCH ON THE EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES I WENT THROUGH AS AN ATHLETE. \"\"I ALWAYS CHALLENGE MYSELF AND MY TEAM TO PUSH HARDER, THINK BIGGER AND NEVER GET COMPLACENT. \" KOBE ON LEBRON JAMES SIGNING WITH THE LAKERS: \"I COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES... IT'S HIS TURN NOW. HE'LL TAKE THIS FRANCHISE BACK TO ITS PROMINENCE.\" \u2014BRYANT ON THE DAN PATRICK SHOW .Kobe Bryant, above , thanking fans at Staples Center following a 60-point performance in the final game of his career on April 13, 2016.

What role did nutrition and fitness play in your career? A.

I stick to a routine and make sure there's time built into every day for working out, being in the office and hanging out with my family.Q. What does keeping a healthy lifestyle mean to you? A. It means still getting up at 4 a.m. and hitting the gym. Q. After hours\u2014who is Kobe Bryant? A. WHAT ARE AFTER HOURS? WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET.

They've given me the inspiration to help guide the next generation. Q. What was the greatest achievement of your career? A. The 2010 Championship win in Boston. Q.

FILL A BIN IN THE PANTRY OR FRIDGE WITH PREFILLED ZIP-CLOSE BAGS OF HEALTHFUL SNACKS AND LET THE KIDS CHOOSE. School-age kids between 6 and 12 grow over two inches and five pounds a year. This could be the reason parents frequently hear their kids complain, \"I'm starving! \" And why kids grab anything they can to fill their hunger, especially sugar- and carb-laden treats. Italian researchers found kids who snacked on high-calorie junk foods more frequently than other kids were more likely to be obese or overweight. Easy-to-access low-nutrition foods have led more than 12 million U.S. children to be obese. How do we combat this? We can start with what we purchase and serve the whole family. Parents hold the power when it comes to their kids' eating habits, so it's important to take the time to stock the pantry with nutritious foods and encourage your kids to make healthy choices every day. And it's never too early to start. Research shows that food patterns begin to develop in infants as young as 7 months old. Today 's infants and toddlers often consume nutrient-poor foods. One-fourth of young children eat few vegetables, and when they do consume a veggie, French fries are the most common choice, according to a study reported last year in the journal Pediatrics. Children learn about food by observing the eating behaviors of others, especially their parents. Kids won 't want to try a nutritious food if you seem to dislike it. If you want your children to eat nutritional foods, you need to be a positive role model by eating those foods too. If your family eats healthfully, your kids are less likely to becoming picky eaters or overeaters. You 'll help form food habits that they 'll carry into a healthy adulthood. If you 're unsure about snacks for kids, talk to a Hy-Vee dietitian for suggestions and a store tour. Guide kids to choose healthful foods for their snacks as you grocery shop together. Even if they can't read, show them the nutritional labels on packages and talk about proper nutrition. They'll be interested in trying new foods if you explain how certain foods help them stay strong and have energy to play. IF YOU HAVE LESS- THAN-HEALTHY SNACK FOODS IN YOUR KITCHEN, SLOWLY REPLACE THEM WITH MORE HEALTHFUL ALTERNATIVES. SWAP COOKIES FOR MULTIGRAIN, SEEDED CRACKERS. TRADE POTATO CHIPS FOR LIGHT POPCORN. EXCHANGE FROZEN POP STICKS FOR FROZEN GRAPES OR STRAWBERRIES. Research shows sugary beverages are directly linked to obesity. Swap sugary drinks for water, milk or 100% juice.

Instead, teach them to read labels for the suggested portion size and help them serve themselves in a bowl or on a plate. SET NEW RULES WHEN YOU PURCHASE SNACK FOODS.

Done repeatedly, healthy habits\u2014hitting the gym, snacking on blueberries instead of cookies, bedtime reading with the kids\u2014become routines you perform without a thought . Relying on autopiloted routines makes you more likely to stay consistent with your healthy choices. Get in the swing with some beneficial routines and eventually you 'll find you default to healthy habits. Check out the following suggestions.OF ROUTINE WORDS Tara McMullen PHOTOS Greg Scheidemann BALANCE | August 2018 70LIFE FAMILY HOMEIf you have kids at home, you know there is a routine for everything: waking, naps, meals, bedtime. That's for good reason. Routines give children frameworks from which to explore and understand the world. Routines nurture feelings of trust, security and safety. For parents, routines set clear expectations and reduce chaos. What's the secret to an effective routine for children? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), they should have consistency, predictability and follow-through. Bedtime should occur at the same time each night and may be preceded by a bath and story time. Children can predict that after the bath and story time comes bedtime. If a child begs to stay up later, it's important to follow through and insist it is indeed time for bed. This ensures you and your children get proper sleep time. Regular mealtimes also are important for parents and kids. They reinforce bonding; they also reinforce kids' sense of security. Although family routines might seem mundane, the results can be significant. One study by the American Academy of Pediatrics linked the simple routines of eating dinner as a family, adequate sleep on weekdays and limited screen time to a 40 percent reduction in obesity in American preschoolers. If you juggle a job, family and fitness there's little time left to keep a tidy home. Stay on top of housework by breaking it down into daily, weekly and other routines: DAILY Wash dishes Wipe down counters Take out trash Sweep or vacuum main areas Open new mail and file away or toss Pick up and put away stray itemsWEEKLY Laundry Vacuum Dust furniture Clean out fridge, toss expired foods Change bedding Mop kitchen floors Clean microwave Wipe down appliances MONTHLY Dust lamp shades Vacuum vents and woodwork Wash pillows, mattress pads and blanketsVacuum condenser coils behind fridge Clean oven Tip: Select one task for each day of the week and write it on a calendar. You are more likely to achieve your goals if you write them down and there 's a rhythm to them, says Dr. Gail Matthews, clinical psychologist and professor at Dominican University of California. Monday: change bedding Tuesday: laundry Wednesday: vacuum and mop floorsThursday: dust Friday: clean bathroomsStart with the most challenging or important item when you begin work each day. When you tackle those before slogging through emails, voice mails or social media, your willpower is less likely to wane as the day goes on. Take breaks throughout the day. Consistently taking time to unplug helps the brain consolidate information so you stay productive. Eat a healthful lunch. It provides your brain the nutrients and energy it needs to focus, stay on task and make decisions. Write a to-do list at the end of the day for the next day's schedule. By setting goals, you're more likely to hit the ground running the next day.

DO THAT NEW THING UNTIL YOU GET GOOD AT IT. Maybe you begin by focusing on meal planning. You don't concern yourself with eating more fruits and vegetables. Once you're good at meal planning, then...add one extra vegetable a day.\" \u2014 Deana Preble, Hy-Vee dietitian, Madison, WIWhat you eat is important, but so is when. While every person is a bit different, a good rule of thumb is to eat every three to four hours, Preble says. Many people associate eating healthfully with still feeling hungry. There's some validity to that, Preble says. A fruit or vegetable typically contains fewer calories than a granola bar. While the fiber in the fruit or vegetable should fill you, you may need to eat more often. Set a time to stop eating each evening. \"When we sleep, our bodies are supposed to be resting, recovering and regenerating cells. It's repair time. If we eat at 8 p.m. and go to bed at 10 p.m., our bodies spend the rst two or three hours digesting food rather than resting, regenerating and repairing tissue,\" Preble says. What about intermittent fasting? While some people see success in a fasting routine, Preble recommends you do research. She advises your daily intake never drop below 500 calories, as some fasting plans suggest. Instead, if you want to fast, set a goal of not eating for 12 to14 hours overnight. FOOD through a drive-through or go out to eat.'' Preble recommends creating a meal plan and shopping for groceries the same day each week, or twice a week, to get into a consistent rhythm. Meals should contain all five food groups\u2014dairy, vegetables, fruit, protein and whole grain\u2014as recommended by the USDA, she says. Healthy snacks can be from one or two groups, like vegetables with hummus, fruit with cheese or yogurt with fruit, Preble says. A snack should contain only 100 to 200 calories and should be a whole food rather than a prepackaged item, which often contains empty sugar calories. For nights when your routine falls short, Preble recommends a rotisserie chicken paired with a bagged salad and a bag of microwavable potatoes as a quick, healthy and fail-safe meal. Contact your local Hy-Vee dietitian for information about the Simple Fix program, which includes recipes, meal planning and meal prep assistance. MEAL PREPPING When your stomach growls, do you instinctively turn to fruit or nuts, or do you pop open a bag of chips? Repeatedly selecting the healthy option can eventually become instinctive. A detailed meal and snack plan is key, says Deana Preble, a Hy-Vee dietitian in Madison, Wisconsin. \"Doing a meal plan and keeping to it will help you establish a healthier eating routine,\" Preble says. \"If you don't know what you're having for dinner, you're more likely to order pizza, go \"TAKE ON ONE NEW THING AT A TIME.

PACK YOUR BAG Organize your gym bag the night before. The convenience of having clothes, water bottle, towel, mat or whatever you need at the ready will propel you to the gym. After you've set good habits, tackle bad ones. In The Power of Habit , author Charles Duhigg identifies a cycle of habits: cue, routine, reward. Reward controls our habits, and if we identify it, we can adjust cues and routines that lead to it. Let's say you crave a bowl of ice cream every night while you watch the late-night news. You're not sure you're hungry each night, but the ice cream has become your way to wind down. You want to eliminate the nightly snack but still need a way to achieve the reward\u2014winding down. Change the cue and the routine. If the cue is the time, then at 9:30 head to your bedroom with a book. Instead of snacking, read to unwind. Or experiment with other options until you find what works for you. While a routine can help you stay organized and motivated, it also can grow stale. Regularly assess if your routines still work for you. Try new recipes, workouts and routes to work for a slight twist to your routine.

Don't worry about that. Concentrate on consistency and time. Improvements will come if you stick with it. Don' t allow yourself to stop exercising because of muscle soreness. Think of all the positive benefits of exercise you'll see mentally, physically and emotionally if you keep going. And if you hate to run, don 't run! Find an activity you enjoy doing and you're more likely to make it a habit.\" \u2014 Mary Meier, Ph.D., ATC, LAT Iowa State University It's normal to experience aches and pains when starting a new fitness routine, but no one wants to risk serious injury. Although anyone can sustain a fitness injury, beginners are especially prone because they often take on too much activity and their muscles aren't used to being pushed past normal thresholds. Some soreness is a good thing. Muscles contract as they lengthen, resulting in tiny tears called microtraumas. The tiny tears rebuild while your body rests, developing greater strength and endurance. So aching muscles actually signal you're making progress. Beginners often want to take a timeout when they start feeling the burn of sore muscles, but experts advise to keep moving. \"Muscle soreness is a healthy and expected result of exercise, so don't panic,\" says Mary Meier, Ph.D., senior lecturer in kinesiology and assistant director of athletic training at Iowa State University. \"Work through it. Continue to move the next day, maybe alternating activities. If you started out with running, the next day go walk in the pool, ride a bike, do the elliptical or lift weights.\" It's important to recognize when NOT to work through the burn. If pain is acute and lasts more than a week, see your doctor and identify the source. If the pain comes from a serious injury, it's crucial to treat the area to avoid long-term damage, such as arthritis, scar tissue or reduced range of motion. \"Listen to your body,\" Meier says. \"And don't push through things that you shouldn't.\" \"ADULTS AGES 85 YEARS AND OLDER WHO REPORTED PARTICIPATING IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS HOME EXERCISE, GARDENING, CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING, DANCING, SWIMMING, BICYCLING OR GROUP EXERCISE FOR MORE THAN 60 MINUTES PER WEEK REDUCED THEIR RISK OF SUSTAINING A FALL-RELATED INJURY BY 63 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH NOT PERFORMING ANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES.\" \u2014 U.S. HEALTH.GOV PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINESHAVING AN ACCOUNTABILITY BUDDY DRAMATICALLY INCREASES YOUR CHANCES OF REACHING YOUR FITNESS GOALS.

Two primary factors differentiate them: severity and the time they last. Acute pain for more than 7 to 10 days is likely serious enough to require a doctor. An injury often begins during an activity as throbbing or stabbing in a specific location. You may experience difficulty breathing as if the wind got knocked out of you, or your joints may feel locked, limiting your range of motion. Although experts say you should let some time pass to ensure it's actually an injury, medical attention is crucial to healing. Avoid working out that area of your body; instead focus on other muscle groups if you work out. A physical therapist can help create an exercise regimen to set you on a path to healing and keep you moving toward your fitness goals. Normal soreness, which actually signals muscles are getting stronger, generally lasts only 24 to 72 hours and feels like burning or straining. Your muscles may feel weak, tight or fatigued. You may experience discomfort in regular daily activities, such as sitting or climbing stairs. Keep moving, and make sure to get plenty of rest, nutrition and hydration. And keep exercising! PAIN vs. GAIN BALANCE | hy-vee.com 75Three Steps to Prevent Injury 1. Begin your new workout at your current ability, then gradually increase frequency, duration and intensity.2. Add strength and resistance training to your workout to build muscle and endurance.3. Vary activities and incorporate warm-up and cooldown exercises into each workout. STEP IT UPIF YOU'RE MODERATELY SORE, EXERCISE ACTUALLY SPEEDS RECOVERY BY INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO MUSCLES. LIGHT EXERCISE SUCH AS WALKING OR SWIMMING CAN PROVIDE LOW-IMPACT RELIEF. CHECK WITH A HY-VEE PHARMACIST OR SPORTS NUTRITIONIST AT SELECT STORES FOR TIPS ON INJURY RECOVERY. Staying active while injured can keep your fitness goals on track, help you rehabilitate and maintain your mental health. The amount of activity you attempt depends on your injury. Pain is subjective and genetic factors determine normal range of motion, so no two injuries respond to the same recovery methods. Seek advice from your doctor and visit with a physical therapist to determine what's appropriate for your fitness level and injury.WORK THROUGH IT IF YOU SUSTAINED A PREVIOUS INJURY, REGULAR PREVENTIVE STRETCHING AND FLEXIBILITY EXERCISES HELP STRENGTHEN SURROUNDING MUSCLES AND PREVENT RE-INJURY. To avoid injury, consult the professionals. Clear any activity with your doctor, who will consider your personal health factors to guide your workouts. Lay out your fitness goals . Are you exercising for strength and conditioning? Weight loss? Decreasing blood pressure or cholesterol? Then share your goals with a fitness professional, who can teach you appropriate form. Many gyms offer a free consultation with a certified personal trainer for new members. Begin gradually, building frequency, intensity and duration over time. Once you stabilize or reach a plateau, add resistance or weight training to build more muscle and endurance. It's especially important to build strength in your core, or middle section of your body. A strong core serves as the foundation for most physical activities and provides the stability you need to stay safe in any workout routine.

COLLAGEN FADES AS YOU AGE, BUT YOU CAN FIND IT IN CERTAIN FOODS, ORAL SUPPLEMENTS AND COSMETICS. WANT TO GIVE THEM A TRY? HERE 'S WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW. WORDS Annie Hauser PHOTOS Tobin Bennett Collagen-containing products boast incredible benefits for younger- looking skin, harder nails, more flexible joints and stronger muscles. Do the promises stand up? Some studies suggest they might. Collagen is a structural protein that your body makes to help build tendons, skin, bones and more. \"It's basically the building block of our skin,\" says Lauren Fine, M.D., a dermatologist with Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. The main types of collagen in our bodies are Collagen I (skin, tendon, bone, ligaments, teeth and the outside fluid that bathes cells), Collagen II (cartilage, eye), Collagen III (skin, muscle, blood vessels) and Collagen IV (epithelial cells that line the skin and other organs). \"As we get older, the [body's] production of Collagen I and III decreases,\" Dr. Fine says. \"In our 30s and 40s, the rate of new collagen production decreases. By the 50s, it is half what it once was.\" So anything that augments your skin's collagen is going to be good for it, she adds.TYPICAL HALLMARKS OF REDUCED COLLAGEN IN YOUR BODY INCLUDE FINE LINES, WRINKLES, CREPEY SKIN, STIFF JOINTS AND TENDONS, AND SHRINKING, WEAKENED MUSCLES.

Collagen binds cells and tissue together to help them maintain their integrity.

LAUREN FINE SAYS. A DIET LACKING IN VITAMIN C (WHICH HELPS BUILD COLLAGEN ), A DIET OVERLOADED WITH SUGARS, AND EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS LIKE CIGARETTE SMOKE ALSO DAMAGE COLLAGEN. It makes sense that consuming collagen or applying it onto skin would help. It may not be all that simple. But a few studies have come up with some interesting results. A six-month study at Penn State University in 2008 found that athletes who took an oral collagen supplement reported reduced joint pain. Another study, in 2012, examined 200 men and women with joint pain and found lessened joint pain in a group that drank a collagen supplement versus those who drank a placebo over six months. A 2014 review of 69 women reported improved skin elasticity in those who took an oral collagen supplement. Last year, the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology reported improved fingernail growth among 25 people who consumed a supplement of collagen peptides. The jury is out, however, as to whether collagen from oral supplements goes right to our connective tissue as collagen. Applying collagen peptides directly onto skin, however, has been shown to improve skin quality and texture and to fight wrinkles, Dr. Fine says. \"Things that directly stimulate collagen\u2014growth factors, peptides\u2014ultimately, they're promoting healthy skin formation and have regenerative properties,\" she says. Again, researchers say more studies are needed to substantiate claims.

Whether you use an app or jot a few lines in a journal every day, tracking progress or lack of it can help identify where you slipped up or what habits hold you back. QUALITY VS. QUANTITY For many, losing weight comes down to an easy math equation. Take in fewer calories than you burn and watch the pounds slide off. Right? Focusing on the math alone is a dangerous pitfall. To achieve and then maintain your goal weight, think of calories in terms of quality, not just quantity. TIME IT RIGHT We all have hectic schedules, but watch when you eat. A study reported by the International Journal of Obesity found subjects who ate their main meal after 3 p.m. lost weight at a slower rate than those who ate a larger meal earlier in the day. Try to consume the majority of your calories around the lunch hour, not after you arrive home from work. MORE FIBER, LESS FAILURE You know you need the recommended amount of fiber each day, but do you get it? Research in the Annals of Internal Medicine shows eating 30 grams of fiber every day can lower blood pressure, improve your response to insulin and increase weight loss. Getting your daily fiber is just another step toward ensuring your diet doesn't set you up for weight-loss failure.Correlations are repeatedly found between reduced sleep and increased weight. If you don't get enough z's, it's likely you also eat more and don't exercise enough, thanks to hormone alterations that occur in sleep-deprived individuals, particularly middle-aged women. In other words, if you know you're not sleeping enough and you want to lose pounds, hit the sack a little earlier tonight.

It may be the missing link between you and your weight-loss goals. Dehydration is associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and consistent dehydration (not just a parched throat after a run, but a continual failure to properly hydrate) can double your chances of being overweight. Drink water before meals to prevent overeating, and add more water to your diet, removing filler beverages to increase metabolism.QUICKLY BOOST YOUR METABOLISM: STUDIES SHOW DRINKING 500 MILLILITERS OF WATER (ABOUT 17 OUNCES) CAN INCREASE YOUR METABOLISM BY 24 PERCENT FOR UP TO AN HOUR. \u2014 THE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM 8WHERE 'S THE BEEF? Increasing your protein intake can boost your metabolism, increase satiety and help build muscle mass. In a high-protein diet, you receive more than35 percent of your total calories from protein; you substitute protein for other foods in your diet (especially refined carbs). Switching to a high-protein diet can be well worth the effort. DEHYDRATION IS ASSOCIATED (NOT JUST A PARCHED THROAT) PHOTO Greg ScheidemannHIIT THE WEIGHT ROOM When you first began your weight-loss journey, your exercise routine was likely simple. Maybe you started out with walks through the park, then upgraded to jogging, then running, then a spin class, maybe some Pilates. Now, if you've found yourself at a weight-loss plateau, your previous exercise routine likely won't cut it. It's time to step up your game with some high-intensity interval training (HIIT). More effective at reducing abdominal fat, HIIT can increase overall aerobic fitness, lower insulin resistance and improve glucose tolerance, according to the Journal of Obesity, though it added that more research is needed. Additionally, if you lack the time to increase your current exercise schedule, HIIT provides maximum results with minimal time spent at the gym. HIIT exercises are for every individual, regardless of preferences. Go with classics such as push-ups, planks, squats, lunges and burpees, then add in weights to increase effectiveness. Whatever HIIT exercise you choose (and there are plenty), your goal is quick, extremely intense bursts of exercise followed by very brief recovery periods.

THE OBESITY SOCIETY FOLLOWED PARTICIPANTS OF THE TV SHOW \"THE BIGGEST LOSER\" AND FOUND, IN MANY CASES, PARTICIPANTS REGAINED SOME OF THE WEIGHT LOST DURING THE SHOW. Unfortunately, losing the weight a second time around is much more difficult due to one hard truth. Following bouts of strenuous exercise, metabolism slows to reserve energy and, if you experience the extreme lifestyle typical on the show, you can't expect to continue exercising (and only exercising) until you lose enormous amounts of weight. At some point, your metabolism stops cooperating. Thankfully, the average person doesn't practice \" The Biggest Loser \" lifestyle, but a lesson can be learned. If you try to lose weight, exercise is not enough. As your metabolism slows to hold on to your calories, you need to reduce your intake more to continue losing weight. Someone at 200 pounds trying to lose weight can consume more calories than someone weighing 140 pounds. If you've lost weight and plateaued, but haven't reduced your calories continuously along your weight-loss journey, that may be your big issue.1210 THE COMPANY YOU KEEP We've all heard, throughout life, to hang around people we admire and strive to emulate. It holds true through weight loss, too, when a stable support system is crucial. One study by The Obesity Society shows those who never experienced weight-loss support from their families were less likely to lose weight than their counterparts. In contrast, 71% of individuals who received frequent friend and family support lost weight successfully. If you feel you've reached a weight-loss plateau, don't go it alone. Find a support system of family or friends to cheer you on to your goal. ALL IN THE TIMING Many exercise and nutrition novices rarely consider recovery time, but there's definitely a wrong and right way to recover from your workout. Timing food consumption around exercise and recovery can make a big difference in the results you see in the mirror. A study at the University of Surrey in England shows that women benefit when they eat carbohydrate-rich foods about 90 minutes before exercise, then avoid eating during recovery. Men benefit from eating during recovery (90 minutes after exercise), not before.

Oprah, Dr. Oz, Ellen and many others in the media have weighed in on how infl ammation a ects the body. Infl ammation is the underlying cause behind many diseases. And even when it isn't the cause, infl ammation can lead to serious complications once disease gains a foothold in the body. At the same time, however, infl ammation is a natural part of the immune system. Remember when, as a kid, you scraped your knee or elbow? Redness at the site of the wound was infl ammation doing its job, ghting o harmful bacteria while setting the stage for tissues to heal. So the problem isn't just the presence of infl ammation, but rather its nature\u2014whether it's acute or chronic. Acute infl ammation is short-term (the scraped knee) while long-term, or chronic, infl ammation is the culprit associated with illnesses such as arthritis and heart disease. Unlike acute infl ammation surrounding a skin wound, chronic infl ammation produces steady low-level infl ammation. In part, it's the result of an over ring immune system. Sometimes the body triggers this kind of infl ammation even when there's nothing to ght. The constant pressure causes arteries and organs to break down, leading to disease. \"Infl ammation in general is a risk for heart disease,\" says Valerie Stratton, D.O., an internist with Mercy Comfort Health Center for Women and medical director of Mercy Executive Health Program in Des Moines, Iowa. \"If I have rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, I have a chronic infl ammatory disease, so I already have an increased risk of heart disease because of that ongoing infl ammation.\" Infl ammation promotes dangerous buildup of plaque in the arteries, increasing the risk for heart attack or stroke. Fortunately, there's a test known as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, or hs-CRP, that helps identify a harmful level of infl ammation. \"The hs-CRP level is an additional risk factor we look at to see whether we need to treat you or whether you have a higher risk for heart disease,\" Dr. Stratton says. Chronic infl ammation plays a role in a number of diseases, including Alzheimer's, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis and possibly depression. This knowledge has prompted a fl ood of remedies\u2014herbs, supplements and diets\u2014all purported to reduce infl ammation and promote good health. But infl ammation reduction is never quite that easy. Scientists warn that the impact of chronic infl ammation remains mostly a mystery. \"Basic science hasn't yet answered the major questions about infl ammation,\" says Michelle Petri, M.D., a rheumatologist and director of the Johns Hopkins Lupus Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Researchers such as Dr. Petri have been studying chronic, low-level infl ammation for several decades. They've discovered that lifestyle factors\u2014poor diet, lack of exercise and even neglected dental health\u2014can contribute to harmful infl ammation. Still, much remains to be learned. \"Despite its current high pro le, infl ammation remains a mystery,\" Dr. Petri says.\"Many people think of infl ammation in terms of external signs: swelling, bruising and so on. But in truth, uncontrolled infl ammation plays a role in almost every major disease. Infl ammation occurs naturally in the body. But when it goes wrong or goes on too long, it can trigger disease processes. That's why researchers spend so much time trying to understand it\u2014and developing ways to counteract it.\"\u2014 Cleveland Clinic I THE BEST TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IS PREVENTION.

Long-standing, unchecked inflammation damages tissues and organs, resulting in compromised health for millions of people. Just a generation ago, chronic inflammation and the scope of its potential for damage in the body were not even on the radar screen at medical schools. Today, inflammation is known to play a role in major diseases, such as congestive heart failure and hyper-tension (high blood pressure). But there's still much to learn.CHRONIC Acute inflammation results when you have a cut or scrape of the skin. Or an infected, ingrown toenail, or a sprained ankle, acute bronchitis or a sore throat. Or something more serious, such as tonsillitis or appendicitis. Whatever the cause, the inflammation is short-term and usually starts to disappear after a few days. Without the healing properties of acute inflammation, the body might never heal properly. Without inflammation, simple wounds would fester and turn into deadly infections.ACUTE CHRONIC VS.

As Westerners live longer and continue to get larger\u201435 percent of Americans are obese\u2014researchers have discovered that low-level immune responses (chronic inflammation), triggered by extra weight and lack of exercise, contribute to various illnesses. Lose some weight and you'll also lose the harmful fat cells that accompany obesity; those cells compromise healthy nerves, organs and tissues.YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT INFLAMMATORY CELLS FROM CHRONICALLY INFLAMED AND INFECTED GUMS CAN HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY. THE INFLAMMATION CAN EVEN LEAD TO HEART ATTACK AND STROKE. CHRONIC INFLAMMATION ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN THE TANGLE OF BRAIN CELLS THAT HAS BECOME THE HALLMARK OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.More research needs to be done to determine exactly how diet contributes to reducing chronic inflammation. But it's generally a good idea to eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains while low in fats, processed foods and sugars. Along a similar line, avoid exposure to toxic substances, such as diesel engine exhaust and cigarette smoke, which can set o the immune system.Exercise can seemingly be a contradiction regarding inflammation. While exercise causes an acute inflammatory response in the short term\u2014as anyone has learned upon doing too much\u2014exercise also has a benecial anti-inflammatory eect on the body.

CARNEVALE WHAT HAPPENS AT A ROUTINE PHYSICAL? The doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope to detect signs of heart or lung disease. He or she will also look at your gums, throat, nose and ears for any abnormalities. Men may be checked for hernias and prostate health, while a woman's physical might include breast and pelvic exams. In addition, your doctor will check all your vital signs and may order some laboratory tests.LET'S FACE IT. There's not a lot of impetus to schedule a routine physical examination if you feel healthy. But a physical exam can be a preventive step to help you stay in good health. You can catch up on vaccinations and get a review of your vital signs\u2014body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate and blood pressure\u2014to see how well your body is performing. It's also an opportunity for a doctor to go over your family's health history. For example, if heart disease runs in your family, your doctor may order additional blood tests and screen for cholesterol, while also recommending lifestyle modications. \"Diseases develop over time, and the earlier they are picked up, the better,\" says Kevin A. Carnevale, M.D., associate professor at Des Moines University College of Osteopathic Medicine. Preventive measures can help mitigate chronic diseases such as hardening of the arteries and diabetes. \"An ounce of prevention is worth 100 pounds of cure,\" Carnevale says.GETTING A PHYSICAL EXAM MIGHT NOT SEEM APPEALING, BUT THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS TO SCHEDULE ONE.

An annual sports physical helps ensure student athletes are healthy enough to safely participate. Some states require a sports physical before students can participate in athletics. Even if your state doesn't require it, it's a good idea to schedule a sports exam to make sure your teen is ready for strenuous activity and doesn't have any underlying medical conditions. A sports physical, or pre-participation physical exam, assesses a person's health and fitness as it relates to sports. Doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners all perform sports physicals. Many schools also offer sports physicals. The health care provider looks for diseases or past injuries that could make athletic participation unsafe. In addition, the athlete fills out a form documenting medical history, including such problems as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, dizziness, frequent headaches, heart problems, past surgeries or injuries, severe allergies and medications. Then comes the physical exam, which measures height and weight, heart rate and blood pressure, vision and hearing. The provider also checks neurological function (reflexes, coordination, strength), joint flexibility, mobility, and heart and lung function. In addition, a hemoglobin count and urinalysis are done. If everything appears to be in order, the athlete is cleared to play without restrictions.SPORTS PERFORMANCEPHYSICALS Sources: kidshealth.org/en/teens/sports-physicals.html www.webmd.com/parenting/physical-exams-and-teen-sports#1BALANCE | August 2018 102THIS HEALTH EXAM FAR EXCEEDS THE SCOPE OF OTHER PHYSICALS.WHAT /Comma.highS UP , DOC? A doctor looks for many signs during a physical exam. Here are some insights: HEART When a doctor checks your heart with a stethoscope, he or she listens for an irregular heartbeat, heart murmur or other signs of heart disease. LUNGS The stethoscope also helps evaluate the lungs. As you take deep breaths and expel air, your doctor listens for crackles, wheezes or decreased breath sounds\u2014all possible clues to heart or lung disease. TONSILS & TEETH When you open wide and say \"ah,\" the doctor examines your throat and tonsils for inflammation or discoloring. He or she also gets insight into your overall health by the quality of your teeth and gums. HEAD & THROAT During a physical, the doctor also examines your ears, nose, eyes, lymph nodes, thyroid and carotid arteries for irregularities. HERNIA Men are familiar with the famous \"turn your head and cough\" routine from school physicals. It's a way to check for a weakness in the abdominal wall between the intestines and scrotum. PROSTATE By inserting a gloved nger in the rectum, a doctor can feel a man's prostate to see if it is enlarged or has any suspicious areas. BREAST During a woman's physical, a doctor may check lymph nodes in the underarm area and examine the breasts for abnormalities and lumps that could indicate breast cancer. For a checkup that goes beyond the basics, schedule a comprehensive physical that typically examines the long-term health and productivity of a company's top talent, but is available to anyone with the need. Comprehensive physicals usually include a thorough exam, extensive blood work, urinalysis, vision and hearing tests, and an EKG to monitor the heart. There are also checks for chronic conditions such as heart disease, cancer and osteoporosis. Depending on one's gender, there might be a mammogram or prostate exam as well. Some comprehensive physicals even include CT scans of the heart or the full body, although concerns have been raised about the eectiveness of those tests (delivering false positives or negatives) and the amount of radiation involved. Because they are detailed, comprehensive physicals often include cardiovascular counseling, lifestyle evaluation and an in-depth review with the doctor. There may even be food and tness coaching oered, depending on the scope of the physical. \"REGULAR HEALTH EXAMS AND TESTS CAN HELP FIND PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY START.

UNRIPE JACKFRUIT IS MILD AND STARCHY, WHICH ALLOWS IT TO ABSORB OTHER FLAVORS. USES Jackfruit can be used ripe or unripened, and can be baked, fried, roasted, ground, creamed or eaten fresh. A mature jackfruit is around 30 to 40 percent edible flesh, and the seeds can be roasted.WHAT 'S TRENDING JACK FRUIT If you've heard of (or tasted) jackfruit already, it's likely that you were introduced to it as a meat replacement. Jackfruit has recently been making the rounds as a vegetarian pulled pork substitute, thanks to its relatively impressive protein content, sinewy texture and ability to soak up other flavors, like barbeque sauce. Jackfruit grows in tropical climates and is typically imported. Some jackfruit trees exist in Florida and Hawaii, but they 're not widely cultivated in the U.S. as a food source. While jackfruit is considered exotic to Americans, it's widely available as a dietary staple in native areas including India and southeast Asia. One tree can annually produce 150 to 200 jackfruits\u2014each with the potential to weigh nearly 100 pounds. Jackfruit contains a high amount of protein compared to most fruit, at 2 grams per a one-cup, 160-calorie serving of sliced fruit. It's also a good source of fiber, vitamins A, B and C, calcium, potassium and iron. If you're thinking about adding some adventure to your summer grocery list, the jackfruit is a versatile and healthful way to try something new.THE WORLD 'S LARGEST TREE FRUIT IS GREEN, MILDLY SWEET, DOUBLE THE SIZE OF A WATERMELON AND INCREDIBLY VERSATILE. MEET is in season from March to May. You can find it year round canned in syrup or brine. Packaged and cut-up jackfruit is also available in flavors like BBQ, teriyaki, curry and Tex-Mex. STORAGE Mature jackfruit ripens in 3 to 10 days at room temperature. Cut jackfruit can be stored in the refrigerator up to 5 days. SELECTION A ripened jackfruit should have some give when pressed. Mature jackfruit usually has a strong, sweet aroma and a hollow sound when tapped. PREPARATION Jackfruit has a sticky texture that can be messy to cut. Prep hands, knife blade and cutting surface with oil for easier handling. Cut the jackfruit in half and gently pull the yellow-colored pods from the rest of the fruit, removing the seeds as you go. JACKFRUIT IS A GOOD SOURCE OF FIBER, VITAMINS A, B AND C, CALCIUM, POTASSIUM AND IRON.

That's crucial to understanding that the perceived threat of HFCS is a myth.Does the body process HFCS differently than it does glucose? The answer is no, it doesn't.\" The only difference between HFCS and table sugar is that fructose and glucose are chemically bonded in table sugar but not in HFCS, says White, a biochemist specializing in caloric sweeteners. \"That bond is readily broken during digestion.
