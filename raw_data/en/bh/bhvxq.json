The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board first prepared the daily nutrient requirements more than a half century agoand established the Recommended Dietary Allowance(RDA). The RDA has since been modified numeroustimes and now includes the 13 essential vitamins (4 fatsoluble and 9 water soluble) 4and the following trace ele- ments: copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), Fe, flu-oride iodine (I), molybdenum (Mo), manganese(Mn), Se, and Zn. 5These recommendations, supported by publications from several organizations, are typicallyapplicable to the general healthy population. Over the past decade, the Institute of Medicine has developed a new set of dietary requirements known asthe Dietary Reference Intake (DRI). 6Table 1, based onThe purpose of this review is to highlight practicalconsiderations in the use of micronutrient supple-mentation as part of short-term nutrition therapy in adults. The term micronutrient includes vitamins and trace elements. Vitamins are organic substances not syn-thesized by the body and necessary for normal metabo-lism. They are divided into water soluble or fat solubleand those with or without coenzyme function. Trace ele-ments are metals present in very minute quantities in thebody; they are essential for normal metabolic functionsand are cofactors of enzymes or form an integral part ofthe structure of specific enzymes.Micronutrient Supplementation in Adult Financial disclosure: none declared.

Deficienciesoccur due to inadequate or inappropriate administration,increased or altered requirements, and increased losses, affect-ing various biochemical processes and resulting in organ dys-function, poor wound healing, and altered immune status withdeleterious sequelae. Guidelines for the 13 essential vitaminsand 10 essential trace elements have been established. Theserecommendations, however, are applicable to healthy adults andnot to critically ill patients, in whom decreased serum levelsmay indicate actual deficiencies or a deficiency due to redistri-bution. Benefits of supplementation over and above the dailyrequirements, which may not result in increased serum levels,are also unclear and may, in fact, be detrimental. Vitaminrequirements are increased in disease states, but a similar rec-ommendation for trace elements has not been initiated exceptfor selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn). In practice, a multivitaminpreparation and a multiple trace element admixture (containingZn, Se, copper, chromium, and manganese) are added to par-enteral nutrition formulations. Most enteral nutrition prepara-tions also contain adequate amounts of vitamins and traceelements, although bioavailability may be an issue. Detailedinformation about individual micronutrient use specifically inhospitalized adult patients receiving nutrition therapy will bediscussed, emphasizing the practical and clinical aspects.Clinicians are encouraged to think of micronutrients not asnutritional supplements alone but also pen.sagepub.com Downloaded from Micronutrients in Adults / Sriram, Lonchyna 549 information obtained from this 2006 publication, provides the DRI for the micronutrients discussed in this review.DRIs are further categorized as Estimated AverageRequirement (EAR), RDA, Adequate Intake (AI), and tol-erable Upper Limit (UL) and are explained in the captionto Table 1. These figures serve to provide us with referenceranges but are applicable only to enteral intake and to sta-ble patients. Micronutrient requirements in critically ill patients are unknown. 7Decreased serum levels may not indicate actual deficiencies but just redistribution. The decreasein serum levels may actually be a beneficial and adaptiveresponse, 8as some vitamins at high doses function as pro-oxidants. Benefits of supplementation, which maynot result in increased serum levels, are also unclear. 9 However, the United States Food and Drug Admini-stration (FDA), as early as 1984, recognizing that par-enteral vitamins are a requirement for the maintenance ofthe body's reparative and defensive processes, wrote intolaw the content and dosage of a parenteral multivitaminsupplement. In 2000, the doses of vitamins B 1, B6, C, and folic acid were increased, and vitamin K was added to theformulations (for a total of 13 vitamins). 10However, a similar recommendation for trace elements has not beenmandated by the USFDA. The American Society forParenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) has estab-lished guidelines for the administration of parenteraltrace element additives. 11Tables 2 and 3 summarize the current recommendations for administration of vita-mins and trace elements to patients requiring nutritionsupport. In practice, a multivitamin preparation (including vita- min K) and a multiple trace element admixture (containingZn, Se, Cu, Cr, and Mn) are added to parenteral nutrition(PN) formulations. Most standard commercially availableenteral nutrition (EN) preparations already contain the RDAof vitamins. Table 4 lists the recommendations for vitaminsand trace elements of interest in critical care practice. 12 However, the composition of commercially available trace element preparations in the United States is far fromideal, especially for long-term use, as shown in a recent studyon autopsy specimens obtained from patients with shortbowel on long-term PN. 13Tissue levels of Cu, Mn, and Cr were elevated, suggesting that better trace element admix-tures, available in several other countries, should be approvedand made available in the United States. This study alsorecommended that the daily Mn dose should be decreased to30-60 g and that the daily Cr dose should be decreased toTable 1.

A higher dose of Se (60-100 g), especially in indi- viduals younger than age 40 years, was also suggested.14 In this review, we summarize the currently available information on the use of vitamins and trace elements as an important component of nutrition therapy, especiallyin the critically ill adult patient, emphasizing practicaland clinical aspects. Publications on nutrition supportoften emphasize macronutrient administration with anemphasis on proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. We expectthat this review will help the clinician to appreciate theimportant role of micronutrients in the metabolic supportof patients. Information about the risks and clinical man-ifestations of deficiency, recommended dosages, and pos-sible adverse effects for each micronutrient is presented. The use of PN has become easier in many parts of the world with the ready availability of multicompartmentbags, often marketed as \"total nutrient admixtures.\"However, if improperly administered without micronutri-ents, serious consequences may occur. 15 The role of micronutrients in the general population, in epidemiologic studies, and in specific disease states willnot be presented and can be obtained from otherreviews. 16,17Reviews on the use of micronutrient supple- mentation illness18 and human immunodefi- ciency virus (HIV) infections19provide more detailed information. We will also not discuss in detail the individ-ual and combined antioxidant roles for several micronutri-ents, as these have also been reviewed recently. 20The main focus will be nutrition therapy of the hospitalized patients,usually short-term rather than long-term home support.Absorption and Interactions Most water-soluble vitamins are absorbed easily from the prox- imal gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Fat-soluble vitamins areabsorbed in ileum as digestion of fat bybile and pancreatic lipase is required. In conditions where fat malabsorption can occur, such as pancreatic insufficiency and bile loss, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins is common.Deficiencies may occur with losses that occur with high-output GI fistulas or with excessive diarrhea, as seen inpatients with inflammatory bowel disease. Reinstillation ofupper GI secretions into the jejunum, either via a nasojejunaltube or jejunostomy, 21will facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins that require bile and pancreatic secretions for optimalabsorption; in addition, loss of trace elements is avoided. Food needs to be digested first before trace elements become bioavailable. Absorption of trace elements is dif-ficult to study, and the information available is limited. Znand Se are absorbed mainly in the duodenum andjejunum. Fe is absorbed in the duodenum and proximaljejunum, whereas Cr and Cu are absorbed in the ileum. Interactions between various vitamins are very com- plex. 22For example, vitamins E and C are synergistic. Vitamin C recycles vitamin E; thus, vitamin C deficiencydecreases function of the latter. Vitamin A function isantagonized by an excess of vitamin E. Requirements forniacin are increased in pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiencies. Numerous interactions exist between the different trace elements affecting absorption via the GI tract.Factors affecting bioavailability of trace elements includethe actual chemical form of the nutrient (eg, organic formof Cr is better absorbed than the ionic form), antagonis-tic ligands (eg, Zn absorption is decreased by is decreased by fiber), facilitatory lig-ands (eg, Zn absorption is aided by citric acid), and com-petitive interactions (eg, Fe depresses the absorption ofCu and Zn; Zn depresses Cu absorption and vice versa).Administration of ferrous sulfate with EN can result inzinc deficiency. 23 Vitamins and most trace elements are stored in the liver.Table 2.

However, there is no conclusive proof to indi-cate that additional supplementation is needed when theserum level of a specific vitamin declines. Serum levels of various trace elements also decrease in critical illness. 28Serum levels of Se, Cu, Fe, and Zn are decreased due to sequestration, possibly in the liver andreticuloendothelial system. This may also be due toincreased urinary or other losses and increased proteincatabolism. The decrease in serum levels of trace ele-ments may actually be beneficial. For example, lower Felevels protect the individual against bacterial infections. Toxicity of Micronutrients Toxicity from water-soluble vitamins is unlikely, and up to100 times the RDA can be safely administered. Fat-solublevitamin toxicity can occur, and it is generally recom-mended that a safe limit is 10 times the RDA. Serumlevels of vitamins are not routinely measured in criticalcare. Several forms of vitamins, pro-vitamins, activeforms, and metabolites can be measured. The clinical sig-nificance of low levels is unclear, and supplementationmay not increase the serum levels. Adverse reactions andtoxicity of individual vitamins, where clinically relevant,and dosage recommendations are discussed later. When used at recommended doses, toxicity due to trace elements is unlikely. Zn and Se toxicity as a result ofnutrition support has not been reported. Up to 30 mg/d ofZn may be administered parenterally over 24 hours and isconsidered safe. 29Up to 400 g/d of parenteral Se is safe, although higher amounts have been administered with noapparent short-term adverse effects. It is not necessary to routinely obtain serum levels of micronutrients. Serum levels of vitamins D 25-OH, B 12, and folate are the only ones easily available, at least inNorth America, and of use in clinical practice. Other lev-els that are not commonly requested but may be obtainedfrom specialized reference laboratories include vitaminsA, B 1, B6, and E.30Obtaining serum levels of trace ele- ments is even more difficult. Meticulous collection andhandling techniques, using special trace element-freetubes and collection devices, are needed. Previous bal-ance studies have demonstrated the unreliability of serumtrace element levels. 13Serum levels may indicate recently administered trace elements and not tissue levels. Despitethese limitations, serum levels are the only tests availablefor clinical use. Functional endpoints, such Se) are also not reliable orpractical. Factors Affecting Vitamin and Trace Element Requirements The vitamin status at the time of admission is commonlyaltered in patients with a history of excessive intakeof alcohol (deficiency of most water-soluble vitamins,Table 4.

Elderly patients, especially those in long-term care facilities, and the indi-gent are often vitamin and trace element deficient. 31 Disease processes alter vitamin status. For example, in renal failure, deficiencies of pyridoxine, folic acid, and vita-min C occur. 32Patients on hemodialysis often have sub- clinical vitamin K deficiency33; they are also deficient in trace elements (Se, Zn) and vitamins (vitamins C and E),34 as well as folic acid and pyridoxal phosphate,35possibly due to loss in dialysate or adsorption by the filters. Patients onperitoneal dialysis are often Zn and Se deficient, but this isnot because of loss in the dialysate. 36Patients with alco- holic liver disease frequently manifest deficiencies thiamine, pyridoxine, and vitamin A. 37 GI (eg, fistulas, diarrhea) deficiencies result in loss of all vitamins and multiple trace elements, especially Znand Se. Loss of bile results in fat malabsorption and even-tually loss of fat-soluble vitamins. Pancreatic enzymes areneeded for optimal vitamin B 12absorption, and therefore deficiency may occur with pancreatitis. Chylous leaks and fistulas, conditions for which PN is often required, result in micronutrient losses, due tothe large volumes of protein-rich fluid (up to 3 L) losteach day. Se deficiency secondary to chylous loss hasbeen reported, 38 and it is highly likely that other trace ele- ments are also lost. Treatment modalities also alter vitamin and trace ele- ment status. Gastrectomy or terminal ileum resection maylead 12deficiency. Nitrous oxide admin- istration during anesthesia is known to cause acute folicacid and vitamin B 12 deficiencies.39Various drug-nutrient interactions can occur, for example, folate deficiency dueto trimethorprim/sulfamethoxazole. Vitamin K deficiencyoccurs due to administration of antimicrobials that alterintestinal flora, responsible for the synthesis of vitamin K. A recent issue has been the detection of micronutri- ent deficiencies after bariatric surgery for weight reduc-tion. Despite oral supplements, deficiencies of bothfat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and water-solublevitamins (especially B 1, B6, and B12), as well as trace elements such as Fe and Zn, have been reported after Roux-en-Y gas- tric bypass and gastric banding procedures.40-42 Critically ill patients are especially susceptible to developing micronutrient deficiency despite what is per-ceived to be adequate replacement. The vitamin contentpresent in the best designed commercially availableenteral formulas does not meet the needs of patients withinflammatory bowel disease. 43Low levels of vitamin C in critically ill patients are not explained by age, intake, ortreatment differences and are not prevented by the use ofPN containing vitamin C. 9Cancer patients are especially susceptible to micronutrient deficiencies even whenprovided twice the recommended parenteral vitamindosages. 44It is also important to keep micronutrient deficiencies in mind as a component of the refeedingsyndrome, which occurs in severely malnourished indi-viduals placed on PN or EN therapy without adequatemicronutrient supplementation. Detailed Information on Individual Vitamins Table 5 provides information on the more important vita-mins with references. 45-79With regard to other vitamins, there is insufficient information to make firm recommen-dations to provide extra dosages of biotin, pantothenicacid, and riboflavin (vitamin B 2), although these are con- sidered essential. There are no recent publications ontheir additional roles in nutrition support. Individual par-enteral forms of these vitamins are not generally avail-able, although they are present in multivitamin additives. Biotin is important for carboxylase enzymes involved with carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Symptoms of defi-ciency are nonspecific, and deficiencies as such are rare.Symptoms include dermatitis, conjunctivitis, alopecia,paresthesias, and hallucinations and may be seen in long-term PN patients without biotin. Increased requirementsare seen in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Pantothenic acid and its biologically active form, coenzyme A, are essential for many acetylation reactions,especially the tricarboxylic (TCA) acid cycle. Deficienciesare rare in humans. Riboflavin (vitamin B 2) is a member of natural com- pounds collectively called flavins, with numerous roles ascoenzymes in critical oxidation reduction reactions.Deficiency is more common than often suspected, due tothe nonspecific nature of signs and symptoms, includingedema of mucosa, stomatitis, glossitis, sebor-rheic dermatitis, and normocytic-normochromic anemia.Riboflavin's role in the treatment of patients with HIV hasbeen recently recognized. Treatment of AIDS with nucle-oside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) may resultin lactic acidosis. This is attributed to the mitochondrialtoxicity of these agents. 80NRTIs inhibit HIV viral replica- tion by binding to viral DNA polymerase. However, theybind to other DNA polymerases too, such as those foundin and thereby phospho-rylation with resultant lactic Symptoms are non-specific and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,weight loss, and fatigue, delaying recognition. When sus-pected and confirmed with hyperlactatemia, these effectsof NRTIs have been shown to be easily reversed byriboflavin, 81supposedly through its beneficial effect on mitochondrial function. Detailed Information on Individual Trace Elements Updated DRIs for various trace elements has recentlybeen published. 82Table 6 provides information on Zn, Se, by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 pen.sagepub.com Downloaded from 553Vitamin A (includes retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and retinyl esters) D Vitamin immune function, and growth; neutrophil function45; maintenance of mucosal inliver tissues, important for membrane andintegrity. contain Lack of fromsunlight equip-ment does not).

Fe is an oxygen carrier with its well-known role as a major component of hemoglobin. Fe is considered to be essential for bacterial growth in vitro. Anemia and lowserum Fe seen in chronic illness are considered to be pro-tective mechanisms. 109Free Fe interferes with reticuloen- dothelial system activity, decreases macrophage activity,and promotes growth of microorganisms, especially gram-negative bacilli. However, the original concerns werebased on studies done on patients with chronic renal fail-ure who have other reasons for increased susceptibility toinfections. 110More recent information suggests that intravenous Fe does not increase the infection rate fol-lowing cardiac surgery and may be used safely in the post-operative period. 111,112 Supplemental enteral Fe (ie, in addition to what is contained in the enteral formula) is not recommendedduring acute illness but may be used during the recoveryphase, with or without erythropoietin. We recommend notusing parenteral Fe in acute illness, especially in cases ofsuspected or established infections and sepsis. When Feneeds to be added to PN, the dextran formulation appearsto be safe and is devoid of lipid peroxide formation and isthe preferred form of addition rather than using free Fe. 113 Cr is important for attachment of insulin to periph- eral receptor sites and for glucose oxidation, glycogenesis,lipogenesis, and amino acid transport. It is biologicallyactive only in an organic form. Cr should be deleted ordecreased in renal insufficiency. 114 Iodine (I) is not routinely added in PN supplements in the United States, although it is standard in Europe ata dose of 1 mol/d. The use of I-containing disinfectantsresults in saturation of the thyroid gland with I. General Recommendations Micronutrients should be included whenever nutritiontherapy is instituted. Whether a patient has depletedstores due to cachexia, suffers severe losses such as theresult of a burn, or simply has a critical illness that willsap his or her reserves over the coming days, the micronu-trient levels must be restored and any remaining reservespreserved. It has been stated that a patient who developsa micronutrient deficiency while being cared for in a crit-ical care unit has not received good care. 115Micronutrient supplementation should begin on the first day of nutritiontherapy and continue daily. In burns, early administrationof micronutrients has been shown to be beneficial. 116-118 Additional supplementation is needed when there is anidentifiable deficiency. The most reliable route of administration of micronutri- ents is intravenous, as we can be more confident of the levelsachieved. The gut is the ideal way of administering vitaminsand minerals as it can regulate absorption according to theneeds of the body. Clinical trials that have used the enteralroute for micronutrient supplementation have been con-ducted in trauma. 119 Although nutrient absorption with hypocaloric enteral feeding seems to be unaffected even inhemodynamically compromised patients, 120it is generally believed that in critical illness, the quantity of nutrientsabsorbed by the GI tract is unpredictable due to bowelischemia, edema, or ileus. There is no need to routinely monitor serum levels of micronutrients as discussed in the earlier section on tox-icity. Serum levels must be obtained only if higheramounts are administered, to avoid toxicity, especially inhepatic and renal insufficiency; in specific disease statessuch as burns, renal replacement therapy, and GI fistulas;and in long-term support. 11,13 When depleted patients are fed without proper sup- plementation, the refeeding syndrome may occur as acomplication; this involves not only the well-knowndecreases in serum levels of potassium, phosphorus, andmagnesium but also several micronutrients. 121 Dosage recommendations made in this review have been carefully obtained from various sources. However,as commercial formulations may have variable amountsof the active vitamin compound or the elemental form oftrace elements, the clinician is advised to study the pack-age insert for detailed information. Until modified traceelement additives are available, it may be necessary insome patients to order each trace element separately,although this is more expensive, labor intensive, andbrings an increased possibility of compounding errors. 13 Conclusion In this review, we provide general guidelines for the use ofvitamins and trace elements in nutrition therapy. Thisshould help the clinician to understand the important roleof micronutrients as a crucial component of enteral andparenteral nutrition care, without which nutrition repletionby providing macronutrients alone may be suboptimal.

The importance of the refeeding 2001:124. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 pen.sagepub.com Downloaded from Abstract Fluid and electrolyte management requires assessment of hydration, renal function, and acid-base balance as well as an understanding of the relationship between electrolytes and their movement within total body water. This article discusses the assessment of fluid and electrolytes and provides recommendationsto promote the prevention and treatment of electrolyte abnormalities. Introduction Electrolyte management is challenging for clinicians because of the complexity of the required assessment to provide treatment recommendations. Hydration status, renal function, medications, metabolic syndromes, and acid-base balance all affect electrolyte balance and must be considered during the assessment process. FluidBalance Total body water (TBW) comprises about 50% of body weight in women and about 60% of body weight in men (1). About two- thirds of TBW is within the intracellular fluid (ICF) and one-third of TBW is containedwithin (ECF), which is comprised of intravascular, interstitial, andtranscellular fluid. The movement of waterbetween compartments is driven, in part, by the osmolality of body fluids, which isthe ratio of solutes to water in milliosmoles per kilogram. Isotonic solutions share the same osmolality as body fluids (280 to 300 mOsm/kg), and any imbalance between TBW and solute concentration may result in fluid shifts and electrolyte imbalances (2). Volume depletion refers to the loss of sodium and water from the extracellular space; dehydration results from loss of intracellular water, which raises plasma sodium concentrations and serum osmolality (1,3). In most cases, patients who are dehydratedhave concomitant volume depletion, but it isimportant to be aware that volume depletion and dehydration are often collectively referredSupport Line Volume 33 No. 3 7 to as hypovolemia. Volume depletion may result from bleeding; insufficient intake; \"third spacing\"; or with any abnormal losses from the skin, kidneys, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Symptoms include dry oral mucosa, poor skin turgor, tachycardia, and hypotension. Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, BUN-to-creatinine ratio, and uric acid are seen in hypovolemia, butthese laboratory parameters are neither sensitive nor specific markers (4). Treatmentof volume depletion involves replacementof ECF losses (2), which requires an isotonic solution such as normal saline (NS) or lactated Ringer (LR) to replace losses (Table 1). Incontrast, treatment for dehydration without concomitant volume depletion is the provision of free water such as a 5% dextrose solution, which expands both fluid compartments, predominantly into the ICF (2). Volume overload involves water retention with a decrease in body sodium concentrations (2). It is characterized by weight gain, edema,ascites, elevated blood pressure, and pulmonary edema (4). Treatment includeslimitation of sodium and fluid intake and correction of the underlying cause. In some cases, diuretic therapy may be required. Sodium Sodium, the most abundant extracellular cation, is a key determinant in regulating fluid and acid-base balance, and has asignificant role in transporting molecules across cell membranes (5). Sodium imbalances result from fluctuations in hydration and renal function or abnormal losses through urine, sweat, and GI secretions. The assessment of sodium balance must includean evaluation of hydration status, urineconcentration, and intake/output records. Calculations of factors such as serum osmolality, sodium deficit, and TBW can assist in understanding the cause of theimbalance (Table 2). Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients, with symptoms developing at concentrations less than 120 mEq/L (Table 3) (4). Treatment for hyponatremia starts with determining the current fluid balance. Hypervolemic hyponatremia usually requires fluid restriction or administration of a diuretic because the total body sodium is normal or slightly elevated. Hypovolemic hyponatremia results from a deficit in TBW and sodium that responds to volume replacement of NS or LR. In either case, thesodium concentration must be corrected slowly at a rate of 0.5 mEq/L/hr for chronic hyponatremia (developed over 2 to 3 days) and up to 1 to 2 mEq/L/hr for acute hyponatremia (developed <48 hours) (7). Correcting hyponatremia too quickly mayinduce neurologic complications (7). Half of (Continuedonnextpage)DevelopingaPlanofCareforFluidandElectrolyteManagement Kristen M.

Use of a 3% sodium chloride solution should be reserved for severe, symptomatic hyponatremia (Table 4).Treatment for hypernatremia also startswith determining the current fluid balance. Hypovolemic hypernatremia is a result of both sodium and TBW loss that responds to NS until euvolemia is restored. Further correction of hypernatremia can be achieved through administration of 5% dextrose inwater, 12NS, or14NS (Table 4). No more than half the calculated water deficit should be replaced over the first 24 hours, withcomplete correction occurring over thenext 48 to 96 hours (Table 2). Hypervolemic hypernatremia is typically iatrogenic and may require restrictions in both fluid and sodium. Patients experiencing symptomatic hypernatremia should have serum sodiummonitored every 2 to 4 hours, and monitoringshould continue every 4 to 8 hours once symptoms have resolved and the serum sodium concentration has normalized (7). ChlorideandAcetate Chloride and acetate are anions foundprimarily in the ECF that are essential to maintaining osmotic pressure and acid- base balance (2). Imbalances in chloride and acetate may result from hypovolemia or anacid-base imbalance. Assessment of theseanions includes evaluation of hydration status, serum trends, and ventilator settings, when indicated. Chloride and acetate have an inverse relationship; as one ion increases,the other decreases. Adjustments to acetateare based on fluctuations in serum bicarbonate (HCO 3-) concentrations, which are reported in the laboratory results as carbon dioxide (CO 2). Because HCO 3-is not compatible with parenteral nutrition (PN), due to precipitation of calcium and magnesium in the solution, acetate is provided in PN, which is converted toHCO 3-(1:1) in the liver (Table 2) (1,11). Patients receiving intravenous fluids (IVFs) or PN should respond to an adjustment inthe chloride and acetate provision in thesolution. Oral and IV sodium HCO3-may be administered as needed for correction ofacid base imbalances (2). Potassium Potassium is the primary intracellular cation, with about 98% of total body potassium found in cells (2). It is essential for cellular metabolism, neuromuscular function, and protein/glycogen synthesis. It is primarily regulated by the kidneys andis lost through urine, the GI tract, and skin, resulting in a variety of symptoms (Table 3). The balance of potassium betweenTable2.

Hypomagnesemia must be corrected to facilitate the correction of hypokalemiabecause magnesium plays a vital role in the functioning of the pump. Correction of acid-base imbalances results in potassium and HCO 3-shifts because potassium tends to tomove extracellularly when acidemia isbeing corrected Thus, these two ions have an inverse relationship. Asymptomatic or mild hypokalemia (3.0 to 3.5 mEq/L) can be treated orally; symptomatic or severe hypokalemia (<2.5 mEq/L) requires intravenous (IV) replacement (7). Replacing a potassium deficit may take up to several days.Potassium can be replaced with either chloride, acetate, or phosphate. Potassium chloride is best used with a volume deficit, potassium acetate may be administered to correct acid-base imbalances, and potassium phosphate should be administered to patients at high risk for refeeding syndrome(Table 4) (2).

In asymptomatic patients,sodium help drive the potassium intracellularly (5). Before treating hyperkalemia, it is important to ascertain that the blood sampleis not hemolyzed, and for patients receivingPN or IV potassium, the clinician must ensure that blood has not been contaminated atblood draw by the PN or IV potassium. Calcium Calcium is an extracellular cation found primarily in bones and teeth that is essentialfor many physiologic functions, includingbone metabolism and muscle contraction (2). Calcium imbalances result from alteredintestinal absorption or urinary excretion, abnormal magnesium and phosphorusconcentrations, and altered parathyroid function, which can create a variety of symptoms (Table 3). Because calciumbalance is regulated by hormones (parathyroid hormone and calcitonin) and vitamin/mineralstatus (e.g., vitamin D, phosphorus), theseparameters must be evaluated (2). Total plasma calcium concentrations areaffected by protein status because approximately 50% of calcium is protein- bound (2). Assessment of ionized calcium isthe preferred method for determining calcium status. If ionized calcium measurement is unavailable, total plasma calcium values can be used once corrected for hypoalbuminemia (Table 2). Because calcium balance isaffected by the status of other electrolytes, such as phosphorus and magnesium,understanding their interrelationships canenhance the clinician's understanding of electrolyte abnormalities. Phosphorus and calcium have an inverse relationship, with anincrease in one associated with a decrease inthe other (2,5). In contrast, hypomagnesemia contributes greatly to hypocalcemia andshould be corrected before calcium concentrations normalize (2,5). Symptomatic patients with corrected calcium values of less than 7.5 mg/dL (2) require IVsupplementation. Hypocalcemia with concomitant hypomagnesemia requires replacement of magnesium before starting calcium repletion. For asymptomatic patients who have hypocalcemia, oral supplementation should be increased to1,000 to 1,500 mg/day (Table 4) (2). Hypercalcemia can often be corrected with improved hydration and ambulation. For severe cases, rapidly infused NS to increaserenal excretion of calcium, followed by initiation of diuretics to reduce serum calcium concentrations, is needed (5).Dietary restriction should be used in thesetting of chronic hypercalcemia; dialysis isreserved for patients who are refractory to treatment or who are at risk for calciumphosphate salt precipitation. Phosphorus Phosphorus is the primary intracellularanion and has many essential functions, including macronutrient metabolism, neuromuscular function, and aiding inbuilding bones and teeth (2). Phosphate imbalances result from abnormal renal function, altered intestinal absorption, or redistribution across cellular membranes,leading to a variety of symptoms (Table 3)that should be assessed during theevaluation of a phosphorus imbalance (6). Asymptomatic, mild-to-moderate hypophosphatemia (1 to 2.5 mg/dL) can be treated with oral supplementation and increased dietary intake, except in cases of intestinal failure, when IV supplementation is needed (2). Symptomatic patients who have hypophosphatemia or moderate-to- severe (<1 mg/dL) depletion should receive IV treatment (Table 4). IV phosphate infusions must be administered slowly toprevent rapid correction and reboundhypocalcemia and tetany. When serum potassium concentrations exceed 4 mEq/L,IV phosphorus should be administered with sodium instead of potassium (6). Hyperphosphatemia may require dietaryrestriction, volume repletion, and phosphate binders (Table 4). The serum calcium- phosphorus product must be calculated incases of severe hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia because a product greater than 70 can lead to salt precipitation, causing calcium deposits in soft tissues (2). In these cases, dialysis may be required. Magnesium Magnesium is an intracellular cation vital for regulation of macronutrient metabolismand the sodium-potassium-adenosinetriphosphate pump that also significantly contributes to the maintenance bone structure and muscle contraction (2,5).Magnesium imbalances are typically a resultof decreased GI function, increased urinary losses, and renal failure, resulting in a variety of symptoms (Table 3). Renal function and hydration status must be assessed with serum magnesium values. Total serum magnesium is not a goodindicator of intra- and extracellular magnesium status because values are affected by protein status (2). Serummagnesium values can be used once corrected for hypoalbuminemia (Table 2) or ionized magnesium can be used as a more reliable indicator of both intra- and extracellular magnesium status (2). Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia are often reported in the presence of hypomagnesemia and require magnesium repletion beforesupplementing potassium and calcium (5). Unfortunately, assessing physical signs ofmagnesium imbalance is extremely difficultbecause symptoms tend not to develop unless serum values are less than 1 mg/dL or greater than 4 mg/dL (2). Patients who have normal renal function andare receiving IV treatment for hypomagnesemia may require several grams of magnesiumsulfate until serum concentrations are repleted because healthy kidneys retain less than half the delivered dose (2). Each gram ofmagnesium sulfate should be infused slowly over 1 to 2 hours to maximize retention (Table 4) (7,12). A healthy GI tract absorbs approximately 30% to 40% of dietarymagnesium, necessitating large doses of oral magnesium, which are not usually tolerated due to increased diarrhea. For this reason, IVsupplementation is the common route of repletion.Support Line Volume 33 No. 3 11 (Continuedonnextpage)Dietary restriction or diuretics can assist in correcting the imbalance in mild cases of hypermagnesemia (5). Severe hypermagnesemia requires IV calcium infusion or dialysis for patients who have renal insufficiency (Table 4). Acid-baseBalance The hydrogen (H +) concentration of a solution is referred to as pH. A balance ofCO 2maintained by the lungs and HCO 3- maintained by the kidneys regulates the acid-base balance within the body (2). An interruption in acid-base balance leads to acidemia (pH <7.35), resulting in decreasedcardiac, hepatic, and renal function, or alkalemia (pH >7.45), leading to neurologicand respiratory dysfunction (9,13). Fortunately, complex buffer systems, along with the lungs and kidneys, efficiently maintain thisbalance to sustain life. Buffer systems, comprising HCO 3-, phosphate, ammonium, and protein, work by binding with acid and/or base to form compounds that do not affect the serumpH (2). They are considered the first line of defense and can react to an alteration in pH within 1 second compared with minutes forthe respiratory system and days for the kidneys to compensate (2). The lungs aid in maintaining acid-base balance by adjusting alveolar ventilation to retain or excrete CO 2. The kidneys work to retain and excrete HCO 3-and H +as changes in pH occur. Classification of acid-base imbalances is determined by the organ system that is affected by the serum HCO 3-concentrations. Metabolic imbalances result when the serum HCO kidneys to absorb and excrete H +and HCO 3-ions. Respiratory imbalances result when the serum HCO 3-concentrations alter ventilation. In complex scenarios, mixed acid-base imbalances can also occur. Assessment of an acid-base imbalanceinvolves a thorough review of the patient's history, laboratory parameters, and arterialblood gases, including pH, arterial CO 2 (Pa CO2) values, and arterial HCO 5).Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by hypocapnia (Pa CO2<40 mm Hg) and can be attributed to hypoxic events, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, and more commonly, hyperventilation (9). Management is directed at treating the underlying cause,assessing ventilator settings, and avoiding excess acetate infusion. Respiratory acidosis is characterized by hypercapnia (Pa CO2>40 mm Hg) and can be seen during central nervous system depression, respiratory disorders, and neuromuscular impairment (13). Identification and treatment of the underlying condition is needed for correction. For patients receiving nutrition support, overfeeding must be avoided because this contributes to the productionof CO 2, worsening the acidosis. Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by hyperbicarbonatemia (CO 2>28 mEq/L) and hypochloridemia, commonly seen in the presence of excessive vomiting and the use of loop diuretics (9). The pathophysiology is related to increased loss of H +, the addition of HCO 3-or its precursors, an increased loss of chloride in relation to the loss of HCO 3-, and severe potassium depletion. Treatment of the underlying condition is the first step, followed by volume repletion with NS or 12NS if needed (5,10). Chloride, acetate, and HCO 3-administration should be adjusted to normalize laboratory values, and discontinuation of the diuretic should be evaluated. A histamine 2-receptor antagonist can be used to avoid additional loss of gastric acid (5,10). Metabolic acidosis is characterized by hypobicarbonatemia (CO 2<24 mEq/L) andhyperkalemia that develops in diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure, and lower GI losses (i.e., diarrhea) (13). The pathophysiology includes increased production of ketones or lactic acid, decreased excretion of H +ions, or increased loss of HCO 3-. The anion gap (AG) can be used for a differential diagnosisbecause a positive AG typically represents a normochloremic acidosis where the decreasein HCO 3-is balanced by an increase in unmeasured anions (2,5). A positive AG is seen with increased production/intake or decreased elimination of acid (e.g., lacticacidosis, renal failure, ethanol abuse). Normal AG acidosis is usually hyperchloremic, in which the low HCO 3-is balanced by an increase in chloride. Normal AG acidosis is seen with large HCO 3-losses from the GI tract or the kidneys (e.g., diarrhea, fistulae,renal tubular acidosis). Treatment beginswith correcting the underlying conditionand maintaining potassium homeostasis by adjusting potassium delivery, as needed, to prevent hyperkalemia. This includesassessment of the potassium content of the PN, IVFs, or tube feeding. Adjustment of chloride salts and an increase in acetate can assist in the correction (10). Reduction ofchloride administration may also be needed in cases of hyperchloridemia. CaseStudy FB is a 67-year-old man who has a complexmedical history that includes irritable bowel disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and failure tothrive. He has undergone multiple smallbowel resections, leaving him with a foreshortened length of intestine ending in an end ileostomy. He relies on a modified diet to maintain his nutritional status to Respiratory acidosis Stable to Respiratory alkalosis Stable to 12 Support Line June 2011 to prevent intestinal malabsorption. FB is 5 ft 9 in, and his usual body weight is 55 kg. FB is admitted with dehydration and weightloss. Upon admission, several electrolyte abnormalities are documented, mmol/L). He reports that his stoma output has increased from 1 L of stool daily to more than 2 L. The increase isattributed to noncompliance with his modified diet and an increased intake of hypertonic fluids (ie, juice and sports drinks). FB has no electrocardiographic changesor heart arrhythmias, suggesting that fluid resuscitation likely would correct the electrolyte imbalances. The cliniciansdecide to start NS at 50 mL/hr to provide about half of his calculated fluidrequirements (see calculations). A complete metabolic panel 24 hours later shows adecrease in serum potassium to 5.1 mmol/L(normal range, 3.5 to 5.1 mmol/L), normal serum magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL, and normal serum sodium of 147 mg/dL. The NS is continued at 50 mL/hr for another 24 hours until euvolemia is achieved. Following fluid resuscitation, the cliniciansdecide to start standard polymeric tube feeding to assist FB in meeting his fluid and nutritional needs. Within 6 days of admission,he is transitioned to a nocturnal tubefeeding with a modified diet to maintain his nutritional status without the need for supplemental IVFs. FB is discharged home on enteral nutrition and closely followed in the outpatient setting to ensure weight gain and prevent recurrent dehydration. Step #1: Calculate the total body water (TBW) and water deficit.TBW (men) = 0.6 L/kg x weight in kg = 0.6 L/kg x 55 kg = 33 L Water Deficit =33 L x ([150 mEq/L/140] - 1) = 2.3 L of free waterStep #2: Determine administration instructions. 2.3 L/2 (Remember to provide no more than 12of the deficit within the first 24 hours) = 1,150 mL/24 hours = 47.9 mL/hr or ~50 mL/hr daily Conclusion Understanding the electrolyte composition of IVFs (Table 1), body fluids (Table 6), and medications is essential for a clinicianmanaging IV electrolytes. In addition, understanding the relationship between electrolytes and their movement within TBW during altered hydration status, electrolyte imbalances, or acid-base imbalance is key to developing a thorough nutrition care plan. With this knowledge,electrolyte abnormalities can be preventedor treated safely.

Vitamins are essential organic substances unable to be synthesized in the human body. TEs are minerals present at very low concentrations (equal to or less than 0.005% of body weight) in the human body. Appendix 1 lists each of the vitamins and TEs with their basic functions, and clinical sequelae of deficiency and toxicity. In 1941, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences estab- lished the Food and Nutrition Board, which was responsible for the establishment of recommendations for standard oral daily allowances for each nutrient. The final set of guidelines was referred to as the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA), which were then revised every 5-10 years. In 1997, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences developed the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), which expanded upon the RDAs. The current terms used for recommended oral nutrition intakes are described in Table 1. 1 In this position paper, the RDA was used to determine the daily oral vitamin and TE requirements; however, an RDA was not available for some vitamins and TEs, in which case the Adequate Intake (AI) was used. However, it must be noted that the DRIs are for healthy individuals on a usual oral diet, so these must be extrapolated with care to patients on nutrition support with or without concurrent acute disease processes. With the advent of parenteral nutrition (PN) in the 1960s, vitamins and TEs (collectively termed micronutrients) had to be provided intravenously. This represented a unique nutri-ent delivery system that required a reevaluation of nutrient requirements. While intravenously infused nutrients are 100% bioavailable, it was unknown whether metabolism would be affected by the bypass of normal hepatic first-pass 446706 NCP XXX10.1177/0884533612446706A.S.P .E.N.

Position Paper: in Commercially Available Parenteral Multivitamin and Multi-Trace Element Products Vincent MB, ChB, PhD, FRCP, FRCPath8; Christina J. MD, RD9; Novel Nutrient Task Force, Parenteral Multi-Vitamin and Multi-Trace Element Working Group; and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Board of Directors Abstract The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi-trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications). April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 441 metabolism. Therefore, it was unclear whether nutrient require- ments would be reduced because of their increased bioavail-ability or increased due to altered metabolism and increased urinary losses. In addition, difficulties were encountered in the development of safe and effective means for both the prepara-tion of intravenous (IV) micronutrients, as well as their admin-istration. 2 Subsequently, parenteral multivitamin and multi-TE products became commercially available. The importance of vitamins in the PN formulation was demonstrated by reports of significant complications and even deaths related to thiamine (also spelled as thiamin) and other vitamin deficiencies during national parenteral vitamin shortages in 1988 and 1996. 3-8 Moreover, zinc, copper, selenium, and chromium deficiencies have been reported when these TEs have been excluded from PN. 9-12 In 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared parenteral multivitamin preparations as \"ineffective as currently formulated\" because they lacked certain essential vitamins and some vitamins were present in too high or too low concentrations. 13 In 1975, the Nutrition Advisory Group (NAG) of the Department of Food and Nutrition and the American Medical Association (AMA) proposed guidelines for 9 water-soluble (ascorbic acid, A [retinol], D [cholecal-ciferol/ergocalciferol], E [-tocopherol], K [phylloquinone]) for adult and pediatric age groups. 14,15 The FDA accepted the adult formulation in 1979 and the pediatric formulation in 1981. In 1985, the FDA and AMA co-sponsored a workshop on parenteral multivitamins where increases in doses of ascor - bic acid, thiamine, pyridoxine, and folate, as well as the addi-tion of vitamin K to the adult formula, were recommended. However, these changes were not mandated by the agency until 2000. 16 In 1988, pediatric parenteral vitamin require- ments were reevaluated by the Committee on Clinical Practice Issues of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition and mod-ified according to input from the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Institute of Child Health and Development. 17 In 1979, the NAG and AMA18,19 recommended that 4 TEs, zinc, copper, manganese, and chromium, be provided in adult PN formulas; daily dose ranges were provided (Table 2). In 1984, recommendations were made to add selenium, decrease the dose range for copper, and increase the dose ranges for both manganese and chromium. 20 In 1994, the recommended dose range for selenium was increased and those for manga-nese and chromium were decreased. 21 These recommendations were reviewed by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) in 1998 22 and 2004,23 and a fur - ther recommendation was made to modestly decrease the dose range for selenium. In February 2009, the annual A.S.P.E.N. Research Workshop focused on \"Micronutrients in Parenteral Nutrition: Too Little or Too Much?\" 24 At this workshop, a group of international experts reviewed the parenteral requirements of many of the vitamins and TEs as well as two related nutrients, carnitine and choline. The panel concluded that changes were needed in Table 1. Current Terms Used to Describe Dietary Reference Intakes for Oral Requirements1 Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)\u2014the average daily intake expected to meet the needs of 50% of the healthy individuals in a particular life stage or gender group based on available scientific literature. Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\u2014the average daily dietary nutrient intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%-98%) healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group. The RDA is calculated by adding 2 standard deviations to the EAR unless the requirement distribution is skewed, in which case the RDA is set between 97th and 98th percentile. If there is insufficient evidence to establish an EAR, then no RDA can be calculated. Adequate Intake (AI) \u2014the recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of nutrient intake by a group or groups of apparently healthy individuals that are assumed to be adequate. AI is used when an RDA cannot be determined. T olerable Upper Intake Level (UL)\u2014the highest average daily nutrient intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. As intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects may increase. Table 2.

In May 2009, the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors formed the Novel Nutrient Task Force with a charge to assess the level of scientific evidence for the clinical use of several different par - enteral nutrients and develop position statements for each nutrient. The position statements were to address evidence-based data on the use of these nutrients in clinical practice and to provide recommendations for changes in the products available in the U.S. The task force was divided into working groups for each of these nutrients, one of which was the Parenteral Vitamin and TE Working Group. Issue/Problem Definition Recommendations for adult and pediatric patients are included in this position paper, and the pediatric patients are referred to as either neonates or pediatric (pediatric patients excluding neonates). The Working Group determined the procedure for development, review, and approval of this position paper (Figure 1). The literature review was primarily based on the review articles published from the 2009 A.S.P.E.N. Research Workshop. However, several vitamins and TEs were not reviewed as a part of the workshop, so Working Group mem-bers were assigned to complete literature reviews on these micronutrients (Table 3). Members of the Working Group with pediatric and neonatal expertise also conducted an addi-tional literature review regarding recommendations for paren-teral vitamin and TE supplementation in these patient populations. The current adult, pediatric, and neonatal oral and paren- teral daily recommendations for vitamins and TEs are shown in Tables 4-7. The commercially available multiple and indi-vidual parenteral vitamin and TE products available in the U.S. and in Europe are shown in Tables 8-13. Recommendations for Parenteral Vitamins Based on the recommended doses for the current parenteral multivitamin products, the daily dose of the fat-soluble vita-mins is approximately the same as the oral RDA or AI for these vitamins, even though the bioavailability should be much greater when these vitamins are administered intrave-nously. The rationale for providing a higher effective dose when given as part of PN therapy was that these patients had higher vitamin requirements due to malnutrition, base-line vitamin deficiencies, and metabolic changes secondary to acute and chronic illness. 41 The currently administered water-soluble vitamin daily parenteral doses are 2-5.5 times greater than the oral RDA or AI. The rationale for giving even higher relative doses for these vitamins was that in addition to the increased requirements, as discussed above, there is increased urinary excretion of water-soluble vitamins when administered intravenously. 41 These relatively high doses of vitamins have been used in PN therapy for over 30 years, and no toxicity has been described. Therefore, A.S.P.E.N. does not recommend any dose reductions in the parenteral multivitamin products. The recommendations for daily oral intake of vitamin D were increased in 2010. 42 The IOM established RDAs for vita- min D that ranged from 400 International Units at birth to 800 International Units in the elderly (Tables 4 and 5). There is concern as to whether the daily dose of 200 International Units Table 3.

Compher et al43 measured serum 25-hydroxyl vitamin D concentrations in 6 stable, intestinal failure patients on long-term PN, 2 males and 4 females, and all the patients were vitamin D deficient with concentrations ranging from 5-14 ng/mL (reference range, 20-100 ng/mL). Corey et al 44 mea- sured serum 25-hydroxyl vitamin D concentrations in 35 patients that required home PN, all of whom had received parenteral multivitamin formulations that contained 200 International Units of cholecalciferol (D 3) per day. This group consisted of 26 women and 9 men who used PN for a duration of 4 weeks to over 20 years, and all patients con-sumed some oral nutrition. Vitamin D deficiency, defined as 25(OH) vitamin D concentration <30 ng/mL, occurred in 77% of the patients. In a recent study, Thomson and Duerksen 45 reported vitamin D insufficiency in 27% and vita- min D deficiency in 68% of a group of 22 adult home patients who used PN for a duration of 1 month to over 14 years. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as 25(OH) vitamin D >50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) but <75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), and D deficiency was defined as <50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). Two of the patients in that study were taking oral vitamin D supplements; one took 2000 International Units cholecalcif-erol per day and was not deficient, and the other was taking 50,000 International Units ergocalciferol per week and was deficient. In an abstract published in 2009, doses of 40-75 mcg (1600-3000 International Units) of oral vitamin D per day failed to improve 25(OH) vitamin D levels in 5 out of a group of 10 home PN patients. 46Figure 1.

It appears that the current parenteral form and dose of vitamin D supports ade-quate blood levels. 49 A.S.P.E.N. also recommends that parenteral multivitamin products with and without vitamin K should continue to be available. This permits clinicians the option to withhold vita-min K when required, such as in the case of those patients who require warfarin therapy.The scientific data supporting the current dose recommen- dations for pediatric and neonatal parenteral vitamin adminis-tration are very limited, so there are insufficient data to make any recommended changes in the current pediatric and neona-tal parenteral multivitamin products. Recommendations for Parenteral Carnitine and Choline and choline are technically not vitamins, but their essentiality was considered by the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM. Both of these nutrients either have been used in PN formulas or have been investigated for inclusion in PN formulas. Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound biosynthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine. It is required for the transport of fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondria during the breakdown of lipids for the by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 446 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) Table 6.

A.S.P.E.N. recommends that further investigation is needed in these patient populations.Choline is a quaternary amine endogenously synthesized from the amino acid methionine and has been listed as a required dietary nutrient since 1998 by the U.S. IOM Food and Nutrition Board. In addition, the FDA requires choline supple-mentation of infant enteral formulas. 52 It is an essential compo- nent of all cell membranes and is necessary for DNA repair due to its role as a methyl donor. It also serves as the precursor for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

Importantly, choline deficiency may cause or contribute to PN-associated hepatic steatosis; animal models have shown progression to steatohepatitis and even development of hepatocellular carcinoma with long-term cho-line deficiency. Currently, there is no commercially available parenteral choline product. 30 A.S.P.E.N. recommends that a commercially available parenteral choline product, either as an individual product or incorporated into a multivitamin product, should be developed and routinely added to adult PN formulas at a dose of 550 mg/d. The recommended daily choline neona-tal and 9-13 years: 375 mg >13 years: adult amounts Additional data will be required to determine whether higher doses (ie, greater than the AI for choline) are optimal. Recommendations for Parenteral TEs A.S.P.E.N. has numerous recommendations for changes to the currently available parenteral TE products. This stems from several factors. First, and foremost, while the FDA approved the initial 1979 guidelines for daily parenteral TE doses published by the AMA, 18 the agency's approval has not been updated to reflect the changes advised by recent TE expert conferences (Table 2). These recommendations included greatly reduced daily doses of both copper and manganese based on the reports of manganese toxicity and by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 448 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) excessive organ accumulation of both manganese and cop- per in patients who had received long-term PN.53-57 Therefore, the current multi-TE products available in the U.S. provide excessive copper and manganese. TE contamination of PN is also of concern. Beginning in the late 1970s, several reports described contamination of PN formulations with zinc, 58-62 copper,58,60-63 manga- arsenic, and strontium were also found. 62,68,69 Aluminum toxicity has been a serious con- cern, which has been at least partially addressed by the FDA.70 Studies analyzing TE contents of PN component products have shown several contaminants in amounts greater than 1 mcg/L, including zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, sele-nium, boron, aluminum, titanium, barium, cadmium, arsenic, and strontium. TE contamination was found in all PN compo-nents tested, even in those that were not intended to contain TEs. The greatest amounts of contamination were found in the amino acids, potassium chloride, calcium gluconate, and sodium chloride products. Amounts varied between manufac-turers and in different lots from the same manufacturer. 62,71 Pluhator-Murton et al62 calculated the amount of trace elements in a 2-L PN solution made with the tested compo-nents, compared those numbers with the amounts expected to be provided in the same PN solution, and found an extra 1.1 mg Zn, 0.08 mg Cu, 38 mcg Mn, 15 mcg 21 mcg Se. The amounts of contaminant Mn and Cr found in that study were approximately 63% of the current recommended daily requirement for Mn and 100% of the daily requirement for Cr. Buchman et al 71 reported substantial variation in levels of heavy metal contamination between PN formulations that used components from varied manufacturers, as well as differ - ences in levels of contamination between adult, renal, and pediatric formulations. Chromium contamination was substan-tial in all formulations evaluated but was greatest in a \"renal\" formulation. Chromium contamination occurred primarily in dextrose, amino acids, and TE components.Table 8.

Manufacturers, products, and product information can change frequently. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 452 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) Over the years, the manufacturing processes have evolved so it is unclear as to the amount of TE contamination in the current PN formulas. A.S.P.E.N. recommends that these contamination studies be repeated on the current PN com-ponent products. A.S.P.E.N. has multiple recommendations regarding the current multiple TE products as well as indi-vidual dosing of some TEs. Therefore, each TE will be dis-cussed separately. Zinc. Zinc is included in the current multiple TE prod- uct in the U.S. The data that support the routine addition of 3-4 mg/d in all PN formulations are stronger than in any other TE. 12 Individual parenteral zinc products are also available and can be used to add additional zinc to the PN formula. Patients with enterocutaenous fistulae, diarrhea, and intestinal drainage may require up to 12-17 mg of zinc per liter of lost fluid. 71,72 Patients with severe burns require much larger amounts of zinc per day to compensate for losses through the burnt skin. 73 A.S.P.E.N. recommends no changes to the zinc concentrations in the current parenteral multiple TE or individual zinc products. Selenium. There is strong evidence that selenium should be routinely added to all PN formulas. 11 However, some of the currently available parenteral multiple TE products in the U.S. do not contain selenium. Selenium is available as an individual parenteral product that can be added to PN formulas separately (Tables 10 and 11). However, the rec-ommended daily parenteral intake of selenium has fluctu-ated considerably (Table 2). The current recommended parenteral intake is 20-60 mcg/d, which seems to be too low, because patients receiving this level of daily intake fre-quently have low plasma concentrations of selenium. 11 A.S.P.E.N. recommends that selenium be routinely added to PN formulas, either in a multiple TE product or as a sepa-rate component. A.S.P.E.N. also recommends that the adult daily parenteral selenium requirement should be increased to 60-100 mcg per day. 11 Patients who are deficient or who are critically ill, septic, or have severe burns may benefit from short-term, very high daily doses administered sepa-rate from the PN, but this remains controversial. 74-78 Selenium is not included in any pediatric or neonatal mul- tiple TE product currently available in the U.S. A.S.P.E.N. rec- ommends that selenium be added to these products. A.S.P.E.N. also recommends that selenium should routinely be provided at a dose of 2 mcg/kg/d in all pediatric and neonatal PN formulas. Manganese. In 2001, Dickerson53 reviewed 17 reports of 389 patients on PN that developed hypermanganese- mia (265 adults and 124 children). Most patients had no clinical symptoms; a small number developed a Parkin-son-like syndrome, confusion, irritability, and occasional seizures. Laboratory studies showed increased serum and red blood cell manganese and increased basal ganglia magnetic resonance image (MRI) signal intensities that regressed after manganese infusion was discontinued; improvement required 6-12 months. In 2008, Hardy et al54 reviewed the medical literature after 2001. There were 11 additional reports that included a total of 229 patients who required PN (75 adults and 154 chil-dren). Hypermanganesemia occurred particularly in infants with cholestasis, often within 3 weeks of the initiation of PN. Another study in which measurements of manganese con-tent in autopsy tissues were reported from 8 patients who lived 2-21 years on PN showed significant manganese eleva-tion in liver and kidney samples, especially in patients who died of liver or renal failure. 55 While the mechanism of man- ganese neurotoxic damage is not precisely known, a recent study 56 using cultured rat astrocytes found manganese induced mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in gluta-mine/glutamate cycling. Current adult multiple TE products available in the U.S. provide 500-800 mcg manganese per day and the pediatric/neonatal TE products provide 2-10 mcg/kg/d, and most patients developing hypermanganesemia had received doses within these ranges. Hypermanganesemia is also seen in Europe, where the most widely used products for adults provide 265 mcg/d. A well-designed Japanese dose-finding study showed adult PN patients maintained a stable whole-blood manganese level on a supplement of 55 mcg/d. 79 Less than this caused a fall in red blood cell (RBC) manganese to values lower than control, whereas an increase in RBC manga-nese and in MRI signal intensity was likely if 110 mcg or more was supplemented, 79 which has also been shown in other studies.80 A.S.P.E.N. recommends that the dose of manganese in parenteral multiple TE products be decreased to 55 mcg/d for adults and 1 mcg/kg/d in pediatric and neonatal prod-ucts with a maximum daily total dose of 55 mcg. Manganese dose should be further decreased or withheld in patients with significant cholestasis or hepatic dysfunction, elevated whole blood manganese levels, or in those with signs and symptoms of manganese toxicity. In addition, A.S.P.E.N. rec-ommends the amount of manganese contamination in a standard adult composite PN formulation be limited to <40 mcg/d. Contamination data for pediatric and neonatal PN for - mulas are not available and require further research. Copper. Copper toxicity is exemplified by Wilson's dis- ease, an inborn error of copper metabolism leading to high concentrations of copper, particularly in the liver, brain, and kidney, which in turn leads to the development of cirrhosis, neurologic sequelae, and renal impairment. 81 While copper overload in PN patients has not been shown to mimic the clinical aspects of Wilson's disease, very elevated concen-trations of hepatic copper, which meet the diagnostic crite-ria for Wilson's disease (copper >250 mcg/g dry weight), have been reported. Blaszyk et al 57 performed liver biopsies on 28 long-term PN patients with cholestasis, and hepatic copper ranged from 10-2248 mcg/g dry weight, and in 8 of by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 453 the 28 PN patients, hepatic copper was >250 mcg/g. The copper doses infused were not described in this paper. In the previously referenced autopsy tissue study,55 cop- per concentrations were measured in heart, muscle, liver, and kidney. Copper was significantly elevated in liver and kidney tissue, especially in patients who died of liver failure. These 8 patients received a commercial multiple TE formula-tion that met the 1979 recommendations for infusion of 0.5-1.5 mg/d of copper. The subjects had received 1.4 mg/d of copper for a mean of 14 years. Copper balance studies reported by Shike et al 82 indicated this amount was approxi- mately 3 times the typical requirement. By analogy, with cholestatic infants, it is likely that copper accumulates as a result of liver disease, but it is also possible that hepatic cop-per overload enhances the liver damage. Currently, the adult parenteral multiple TE products avail- able in the U.S. provide approximately 1 mg/d of copper. A.S.P.E.N. recommends that the dose of copper in adult par - enteral multiple TE products be lowered to 0.3-0.5 mg/d and limit the amount of contamination in a composite PN formu-lation to no more than 0.1 mg/d. Copper doses should be decreased or omitted in patients with significant cholestasis or hepatic dysfunction. Copper requirements are increased in severe burn patients. 73 Because of the absence of contam- ination data for pediatric and neonatal parenteral TE prod-ucts, no recommendations for product changes are currently made, but investigation of copper contamination in these prod-ucts should be required. Chromium. Chromium toxicity varies depending on the chromium valency. Chromium IV , V , and VI are carci- nogenic. Chromium in PN formulations, food, and oral supplements is trivalent and considered nontoxic. 1 Analy- sis of PN formulations showed that chromium was only in the trivalent form. 83 There are several reports in PN patients, both adults and children, of serum and urine chromium concentrations 10-100 times normal val-ues. 84-87 Autopsy tissue data found similar elevations in heart, muscle, liver, and kidney samples.55 A normal adult diet provides approximately 35 mcg/d of chromium. Recent studies have revised the estimated amount of dietary chromium absorbed from the previous level of 10%-20% down to 0.4%-2.5%. 88 This means the absorbed amount of chromium from a standard adult oral diet is only 0.4-0.9 mcg/d. Therefore, the parenteral requirement is likely to be only one-tenth or less of the previously rec-ommended amounts of 10-15 mcg/d. According to Pluhator-Murton et al's data,62 chromium 2-L PN composite formula is approxi- mately 15 mcg per day, mainly from the 70% dextrose solu-tion used, and is in addition to the 11 mcg/d intentionally added from a multiple TE product. This amounts to a paren-teral chromium dose that is 30-60 times greater than the cur - rent estimated requirement. The key question is whether these high chromium doses are without clinical consequence or are potentially toxic. In adults, there are no reported cases of chromium toxicity in patients on long-term PN, suggesting that these high chromium concentrations are not toxic. This is further supported by a study that found very high serum chro-mium concentrations and increased urinary chromium excre-tion related to the implantation of hip prostheses in adult patients with no deterioration in renal function when observed over a 10-year period. 89 Another study randomized uncon- trolled patients with diabetes to either a supplement with a combination of chromium picolinate and biotin or placebo for 90 days. The study group experienced a significant decrease in hemoglobin A1c compared with the placebo group, and there was no difference in adverse effects between the 2 groups. 90 There are isolated reports of individuals who devel- oped renal failure due to tubular necrosis following the inges-tion of large doses of chromium as chromium picolinate. 91-96 This toxicity did not appear to be due to the picolinate moiety and has been assumed related to chromium. So while increased levels of serum and tissue chromium occur with current PN regimens, the toxicity of these levels at least in adults remains unknown. Chromium toxicity may be more of a concern in pediatric patients. In 1992, Moukarzel et al 97 found that glomerular fil- tration rates (GFRs) in PN-dependent children were inversely correlated with their serum chromium concentration, their cumulative parenteral chromium intake, and PN duration. The investigators discontinued parenteral chromium supplementa-tion, and a year later, the children's serum chromium concen-trations were lower but still elevated, and their reduced GFR was still below control patients who did not receive PN. The investigators were unable to determine whether chromium contamination had resulted in irreversible renal injury. Buchman et al 71 found renal tubular damage and high concen- trations of chromium deposits in the kidneys of rodents after receiving 1 week of PN; however, it was difficult to determine if this was a cause-and-effect relationship. Current adult multiple TE products available in the U.S. provide 10-15 mcg/d of chromium. Based on oral absorption in healthy individuals, 88 the parenteral requirements may be as low as 0.14-0.87 mcg/d.10 Because PN components have sig- nificant chromium contamination, some physician investiga-tors have stopped adding chromium to PN formulations, but the consequences of such actions have not been evaluated. The requirements for chromium during PN with a high and con-tinuous IV dextrose load are not known, and despite chromium contamination, rare PN-dependent adult patients have been reported to require additional chromium in order to maintain glucose tolerance. 98-101 Until contamination is reduced and the issue of parenteral chromium toxicity is better understood, A.S.P.E.N. recommends that in addition to the current multiple TE products that contain 10-15 mcg/d of chromium, a multiple TE product without added chromium should be made by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 454 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) available. Research on chromium requirements during PN and the effects of contamination on requirement for supplementa-tion is urgently needed. The pediatric and neonatal multiple TE products available in the U.S. provide 0.05-0.2 mcg/d of chromium. Studies of pediatric/neonatal PN patients on this level of supplementation report serum chromium concentrations 4-42 times that of nor - mal. 10,86 Moukarzel10 recommended that the daily parenteral dose of chromium for neonates and pediatric patients be radi-cally reduced. In view of preliminary studies in newborns on PN that demonstrate chromium nephrotoxicity, and because PN formulations have significant chromium contamination, A.S.P.E.N. recommends that the daily dose of chromium be reduced to the levels recommended by Moukarzel (Table 14) and that a pediatric/neonatal multiple TE product without added chromium should be available for use in this patient population. Iron. Iron is absorbed in the duodenum, and iron mal- absorption is rarely the cause of iron deficiency simply due to a short bowel. However, patients with a short bowel often have disease that results in iron loss or have dietary restrictions preventing an adequate intake of iron. In addi-tion, gastric surgery may reduce the availability of dietary iron. The requirement for iron in males and postmenopausal women who do not have any source of blood loss is about 1 mg/d. It is higher in menstruating women who on average require an additional 0.51 mg/d. However, menstrual losses vary and may necessitate an intake as high as 3.4 mg/d. In patients on PN, iron requirements vary due to diseases causing blood loss or iatrogenic causes such as repeated blood draws. Hence, there is a wide range of requirements in individuals, making a single recommendation for daily parenteral intake difficult. Multiple TE products in Europe contain iron, but TE prod- ucts in the U.S. do not contain iron. Stability of total nutrient admixtures containing iron has prevented its addition to trace element mixtures in the U.S. However, studies using a concen-tration of 0.5 mg/L have shown stability for 7 days of storage at 4\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. 102 The current options for iron supplementation for adult PN patients in the U.S. are: 1. Patients capable of absorbing oral administered iron who may be supplemented using an oral product 2. Addition of 1-5 mg/d of iron dextran to fat-free PN in patients without deficiency and those not having significant ongoing blood loss 3. Separate infusions of IV iron sucrose in doses of 300 mg per infusion to give a total dose based on the Ganzoni formula 103 so as to meet the deficit fol- lowed by daily infusions as above Which option is used in an individual patient depends on his or her baseline iron stores and ongoing iron losses. Iron supplementation in pediatric and neonatal PN patients may be important in long-term therapy, but there is insufficient evidence to develop definitive daily recommendations due to potential toxicity. Many ill children and neonates also receive blood transfusions in the hospital, which may be adequate. Children and neonates should be monitored for iron status prior to initiating parenteral therapy using serum iron, transfer - rin, and ferritin levels. To permit a routine daily supply of parenteral iron, research is required to examine the stability of iron additives to fat emulsion-containing admixtures. Iodide. Iodide is currently included in the parenteral multiple TE products available in Europe, but it is not included in any of the products available in the U.S. (Tables 10 and 12). The amount of iodide contamination in PN components is unclear but appears adequate to meet basal requirements since thyroid function remains normal in most long-term PN patients. 32 However, one study of 15 pediatric PN patients in Europe104 found an inverse correlation between duration of PN and urinary iodide concentrations. While 9 (60%) of these patients had iodide deficiency based on urinary iodide concentra-tions, thyroid function tests remained normal. In the past, the widespread use of povidone-iodine solutions for skin cleansing of catheter sites may have maintained a normal iodide status as studies have shown that iodine skin prepa-ration can result in significant transcutaneous iodine absorp-tion. 105 Since skin cleansing has widely moved to the use of 2% chlorhexidine, the risk of iodide deficiency and the need for parenteral supplementation need to be investi-gated. Routine supplementation of PN with iodide could be beneficial, but more research is needed for adult, pediatric, and neonatal products. 32 Fluoride. Fluoride is also present in the multiple TE products used in Europe but is not included in any products Table 14. Recommendations for Revised Daily Parenteral Dose of Chromium in Neonatal and Pediatric Patients Age Male Female 0-6 mo 0.48 mcg/d These recommendations are based on the Adequate Intake (AI) for these age groups and estimated oral absorption of chromium of 2%. Adapted from Moukarzel A. Chromium in parenteral nutrition: too little or too much? Gastroenterology. 2009;137(5)(suppl):S18-S28 with permission from Elsevier. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 455 available in the U.S. (T ables 10 and 12). The amount of fluoride contamination in PN is variable. Supplementation of PN with fluoride could be beneficial, but more research is needed for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patient populations. 31 Molybdenum. Molybdenum is present in most of the adult and some of the pediatric parenteral multiple TE products in Europe but none of the products in the U.S. Previous studies showed PN was contaminated with molybdenum, but it is unknown what the level of con-tamination is in current PN formulations. Although molybdenum is not routinely supplemented in PN in the U.S., only 1 case of deficiency in a patient on PN has been reported (see Appendix 10). There are no significant data to warrant recommending routine molybdenum supplemen-tation in PN formulas. Thus, no changes are recommended for adult, pediatric, and neonatal products. Counterissues/Problems Definition The main problem with specifying trace element and vita- min dosages in nutrition products is the individual variabil-ity of patient requirements. Nutrient needs vary as a result of prior deficiencies, disease state, surgery, and the presence of sepsis or trauma. Also, micronutrient needs are increased with excessive losses that occur with vomiting, diarrhea, fis-tulae output, aspirates, wound drainage, and burns. The micronutrient dosages recommended by A.S.P.E.N. are meant to meet basic nutrient needs for the majority of patients, while also acknowledging (or recognizing) that some patients may need greater amounts of certain nutri-ents, whereas other patients may need to have certain nutrients decreased or omitted. Although there are a large number of patients receiving PN, the reported incidence of TE toxicities in these patients is very low. One reason may be that PN therapy is usually short term, less than 3-6 months, so the number of long-term PN patients, who are most at risk of low-level, chronic toxic-ity, is relatively small. 106 Signs and symptoms related to TE toxicities may be missed if the patient is not specifically monitored for these complications. Toxicity may inadver - tently be attributed to other factors rather than the accumula-tion of TE. Implementation of A.S.P.E.N.'s recommendations for changes in the available parenteral multiple and individual vitamin and TE products will require product submissions to and approval by the FDA. Some of the recommended changes have already been included in preparations that have been safely and effectively used outside of the U.S. for many years. It is recognized that the FDA may require submission of North American-based studies that include safety and efficacy of the newly recommended products, despite these substances being present in the oral diet. A.S.P.E.N. is concerned that this process may require significant time, financial investment, and other resources. Many companies may be reluctant to make such a commitment on their own, especially for prod-ucts that have a relatively low profit margin, in the absence of requirements to do so from the FDA. A.S.P.E.N. is also con-cerned that industry, rather than incurring the expense of prod-uct modification, could choose to eliminate products from the marketplace. This could result in devastating effects on the patients these same products are designed to treat. A.S.P.E.N. will encourage the FDA not only to require the recommended modifications but also to actively encourage and assist the pharmaceutical industry in the development and approval of safer and more effective vitamin and TE products. Ultimately, A.S.P.E.N.'s aim is that micronutrient products available in the U.S. and in other countries will meet a uniform standard, allowing manufacturers to experience larger and more finan-cially viable markets. Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations The routine and appropriate provision of certain vitamins and TEs in PN is essential in improving nutrition status, allowing improvement in the patient's underlying disease process and in preventing complications of deficiency or toxicity. The current parenteral multiple vitamin products commer - cially available in the U.S. meet the requirements for most PN patients. However, a separate parenteral cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol product should be available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency who are unresponsive to additional oral vitamin D supplementation or when oral sup-plementation is impossible. The current parenteral multiple TE products that are com- mercially available in the U.S. require significant modification as follows: Adult parenteral multiple TE products: Decrease copper to 0.3-0.5 mg/d Decrease manganese to 55 mcg/d Product with no chromium (or a maximum of 1 mcg/d) Include selenium in all products and increase the dose to 60-100 mcg/d Pediatric/neonatal parenteral multiple TE products: Product with no Decrease manganese to 1 mcg/kg/d in neonates Add selenium 2 mcg/kg/d in all pediatric/neonatal preparations by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 456 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) The recommendations regarding parenteral carnitine: Provide 2-5 mg/kg/d carnitine as part of a mul- tiple vitamin or multi-TE products or as an individual product in all neonatal PN formulas The recommendations regarding parenteral choline: Provide 550 mg/d of choline routinely to adult PN formulations (requires development of either an indi-vidual choline product or addition of choline into either a multiple vitamin or TE product) Recommend routine parenteral administration in newborns and pediatric patients with the following The recommendations for TE contamination in PN formulations: Limit copper contamination to <0.1 mg/d total in a typical adult PN formulation Limit manganese contamination to <40 mcg/d total in a typical adult PN formulation In order to accomplish these recommendations, all PN products should be taken into consideration The recommendations regarding future research (in order of priority): Parenteral chromium requirements in adult, pediat - ric, and neonatal PN patients (most urgent) Need further research and development of appro - priate monitoring strategies for trace element and vitamin deficiency and toxicity in PN patients (urgent) Studies on TE contamination in the various PN com- ponent products, especially manganese contamina-tion in neonatal and pediatric PN formulations Feasibility of adding parenteral iron products to PN formulas, to include fat emulsion stability and other potential incompatibilities Benefits of carnitine supplementation of PN in adult and pediatric patients Benefits of fluoride supplementation of PN in adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients Benefits of iodine supplementation of PN in adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients Novel Nutrient Task Force, Parenteral Multi-vitamin and Multi-Trace Element Working Group and Board of Directors Selected Disclosures A.S.P .E.N.

Valentine, MD, MS, RD Introduction Vitamin A (retinol), a fat-soluble vitamin, was initially iden- tified in 1928 and coined the \"anti-infective\" vitamin.1 Since that time, vitamin A and its active compounds have become identified with many other vital functions, including cellular differentiation, vision, epithelial integrity, immune function, growth, development, and reproduction. 2 The provitamin A active compounds, -carotene, -carotene, and cryptoxan-thin, are biologically interdependent based on their structural and/or functional relationships. Of the 500 carotenoids found naturally, only 50 have provitamin A activity. The primary provitamin A active compound after oxidative cleavage of the 15,15 double bond is the trans--carotene. 3 Vitamin A activity is often expressed as retinol equivalents, 1 mcg all-trans-retinol = 6 mcg all trans--carotene = 12 mcg other provitamin carotenoids. 2 The Dietary Reference Intakes,4 published by the Institute of Medicine, more specifically describe retinol activity equivalents (RAEs) where 1 RAE = 1 mcg retinol = 12 -carotene = 24 24 mcg -cryptoxanthin. Dietary sources of preformed vitamin A are found in a high concentration in liver (3000-15,000 mcg retinol/100 g). 5 Milk and whole eggs are also good food sources with 30-70 mcg retinol/100 mL and 100-300 mcg/100 g, respectively. -Carotene equivalents are high in carrots (2000-7000 mcg/100 g), green leafy vegetables (2000-3000 mcg/100 g), potatoes (2000-4000 mcg/100 mcg/100 g). 5 Bioconversion from provitamin A carotenoids is, however, variable and ranges from a conversion efficiency of 3.6-28:1 by weight. 6 Metabolic Effects Dietary retinyl esters are hydrolyzed to retinol in the intestinal lumen, taken up into the intestinal cell and reesterified into retinyl esters (REs), coupled to chylomicrons, and released into the bloodstream via the thoracic duct. 7 The chylomicron remnants containing RE are taken up by the liver through an apolipoprotein E receptor. 7 Vitamin A is kept in the liver peri- sinusoidal stellate cells and, when released for cellular events, is bound to retinol-binding protein and coupled to transthyre-itin to avoid renal clearance. 7 Serum levels do not correlate with liver stores. Vitamin A's major role in vision is photoreceptor function.8 Vitamin A in the 11-cis isoform combines with photoreceptor opsin to form rhodopsin. 8 The metabolic effects of vitamin A in mucosa-associated epithelium are related to expression of cytokeratins and terminal differentiation. 7 by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 468 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) Reliable Assessment for Deficiency and Toxicity Deficiency signs manifest first as night blindness9 followed by xerophthalmia9,10 and blindness. Infectious diseases are often associated with vitamin A deficiency because of altered epi- thelial keratinization. In addition, T cell immune function may be affected by vitamin A status. 3 Vitamin A status is traditionally assessed by serum retinol or the concentration of retinol binding protein (RBP).11 The normal range of serum retinol is 1-3 measured by 12 with RBP correlates of <0.48 mmol/L associated with severe vitamin A deficiency.13 In periods of stress, serum retinol is not reliable and the RBP-to-transthyretin ratio is a better marker for deficiency. 14 In addition, when field testing the status of vitamin A, it is easier to use a radioimmunoas-say for RBP concentration rather than HPLC technology. 13 Preformed vitamin A is absorbed at rates of 70%-90%, but if ingestion is excessive or the vitamin A is given by intramus-cular or intravenous injection, thereby bypassing gastrointesti-nal regulation, toxicity can result. 15 In contrast, provitamin carotenoid sources are absorbed at lower rates of 20%-50%.15 The cleavage of provitamin A carotenoids to retinal is highly regulated, making them unlikely to cause toxicity. Vitamin A toxicity can present with elevated intracranial pressure (leading to symptoms including vomiting, head-aches). Bony abnormalities have also been described with vita-min A toxicity, most likely due to vitamin A antagonism of vitamin D at the receptor level, 16 resulting in bone resorption and decreased bone formation.17 Retinyl esters in serum, which are normally <0.2 \u00b5mol/L in the fasting state,18 can be measured using HPLC to detect toxicity. Serum retinol concentrations have been found to be dependent on age, gender, and season of the year.19 Older volunteers, especially males, and autumn were associated with higher serum retinol levels in a large trial in France. 19 Modifications for Special Clinical Conditions\u2014Adults and Pediatrics (Burns, Cholestasis, HIV , Hematology/Oncology, Renal Failure, Trauma, Sepsis, Intestinal Injury, Cystic Fibrosis) Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin absorbed from the core of the complex micelle. Deficiency can result from inadequate dietary intake or defective intestinal delivery due to abnormal hepatobiliary function or damaged epithelial integrity. Deficiency can also occur with impaired vitamin A mobiliza-tion from the intestine (abetalipoproteinemia) or the liver (protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency lead to reduced RBP formation).In the hospital, patients with pressure ulcers, 20 wounds, or burns21 must receive adequate vitamin A for restoration of epithelial surfaces. In fact, topical application of tretinoin and glycolic acid improved mouth healing and subsequent mouth opening in inhalation-burn patients. 21 Detailed monitor - ing of vitamin A intake and laboratory assessment is, however, critical because toxicity has been documented in patients with >25% burns on enteral supplementation. 22 In a case report, 2 patients on prolonged enteral feeding for 272 and 180 days demonstrated elevated liver enzymes and toxic concentrations of vitamin A 22 on an intake of 1-2 L of 102 mcg/100 mL vita- min A per day in their enteral food source. The mechanism of vitamin A toxicity in the liver is not fully understood but appears to occur when the dose of vitamin A exceeds the available RBP. 23 The fat-storing cells then pro- duce a matrix of laminin and type III collagen that results in hepatic fibrosis 24 and a characteristic picture on biopsy. Because of the importance of vitamin A to T cell function,25 immunity can be compromised by vitamin A deficiency. Linear growth has been improved in children <18 months of age with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on vitamin A supple-mentation. 26 However, in a randomized trial in Tanzania, women with HIV disease showed no significant increase in CD4, CD8, or CD3 counts. 27 Care must be taken in interpret- ing low serum vitamin A levels in patients with protein calorie malnutrition since stores may be adequate, but the liver may not release vitamin A due to a low RBP. 28 Supplementation of vitamins is often practiced to prevent or attenuate cancer risk. However, in a large (N = 8171 women) study with random and blinded assignment to supplementa-tion, -carotene supplementation conveyed no protection from cancer incidence or mortality. 29 Patients with renal failure have reduced RBP renal clearance and are at risk for developing vitamin A toxicity. In a retrospective study to determine the status of vitamin A in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients with acute renal failure, investigators found 17 of 19 patients had abnormally high levels. 30 When the hepatobiliary cycle is defective and intestinal absorption is impaired, as can be the case in short bowel syndrome (SBS), patients have been found to have lower serum concentrations of vitamin A. 31 Home parenteral nutri- tion (PN) patients with SBS can become vitamin A deficient without a parenteral vitamin A source and develop night blindness. 32 Since vitamin A is adsorbed onto glass and plastic containers and oxidized to a nonphysiologic epoxide by light exposure, vitamin A deficiency can develop unless the vitamin is added to the PN solutions just prior to infusion. 33 A case report after gastric bypass surgery for obesity has also described night blindness that corrected after vitamin A therapy. 8 The individual with cystic fibrosis (CF) is at particular risk for vitamin A depletion not only because of fat malabsorption but also due to zinc deficiency. 34 In a recent Cochrane review, however, there was no evidence-based recommendation for vitamin A in a patient with CF. 35 In fact, serum retinol has been by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 469 found to be elevated in preadolescent children with CF on an elevated vitamin A intake of 816 \u00b1 336 mcg retinol activity equivalents per day (165% \u00b1 69% of the recommended dietary allowance). 36 With all special conditions reviewed, it was apparent that a relatively narrow window exists between deficiency and toxic-ity; therefore, it is essential that the clinician investigate all supplements and food sources the patient is ingesting to pre-dict adequacy 37 and practice prudent supplementation. Modifications for Gender and the Elderly Knowledge of typical blood concentrations and dietary intakes related to sex and age can be helpful in baseline assessment in the clinical setting. In a large cohort (N = 12,741) examined for retinol, -tocopherol, and -carotene serum concentrations, retinol concentrations were higher in older volunteers, espe-cially male participants, in France. 19 Vitamin A supplementa- tion has not been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of infection in the older nursing home patient. 38 In fact, when examining dietary intakes in the United States, women tend to have intakes of vitamin A from food above the estimated aver - age requirement (EAR), and with typical supplementation, they ingest almost 3 times the EAR. 39 Thirty percent of U.S. residents use vitamin supplements regularly.37 Modifications of the diet should be consistent with these data. Considerations in Pregnancy and Lactation Vitamin A recommendations are higher in pregnancy and lac- tation to support growth and cell differentiation.40,41 The Dietary Reference Intakes are dependent on age and range from 750-770 mcg/d RAE for pregnant women 14-18 years and 19-50 years, respectively. 4 Isotretinoin, used for acne, is a known teratogen in pregnancy and should be avoided.42 Lactation increases demands for vitamin A, and recom- mendations 1200-1300 mcg/d RAE for 14- to to 50-year-old women, respectively. 4 Maternal supplementation does correlate with increased breast milk concentrations and a low likelihood of serum vitamin A level in the infant. 43 Considerations in Neonates For the healthy infant 0-6 months, the advisable intake of vitamin A is 400 mcg/d RAE. From 6 months to 1 year, the vitamin A intake should increase to 500 mcg/d RAE. 4 Preterm infant requirements are higher because of low stores and the need for increased growth and development. 44 Mechanical ventilation or steroid use in the neonatal intensive care unit increases the need for vitamin A. 45 Recommendations for par - enteral and enteral nutrition for the preterm infant range from 700-1500 International Units/kg/d. 44,46 Delivery to the preterm infant on parenteral vitamin A can be compromised by losses in the delivery system.47,48 This can result in as little as 17%-66% of the expected amount being received. European studies have demonstrated enhanced delivery when the preterm infant is given a vita-min product admixed in intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE). 49 In the U.S., we have yet to have access to these vitamin products. In the U.S., patients receive parenteral fat-soluble vitamin products not approved for admixture in IVFE. Many clinicians will therefore give injections of vitamin A to the extremely preterm infant to reduce the likelihood of chronic lung disease. 50 Drug and Nutrient Interactions Vitamin A supplementation (V AS) may enhance the concur - rent delivery of vaccinations.51 To reduce mortality after 6 months, a study was done to determine if V AS at the time of vaccination had a beneficial effect. 51 The investigators found that the effect of V AS was not helpful in measles-vaccinated girls who did not have up-to-date diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine but had a benefit in lowering mortality in children with no record of immunizations at study enrollment. Of important note is that V AS did reduce the risk of developing xerophthalmia in all cases. 51 Table A2.1.

Dietary insufficiency, fat malabsorption, and calorie, protein, or zinc deficiency can all predispose the patient to vitamin A deficiency, resulting in poor outcomes in any of the vitamin A-related functions. Toxicity is less common but can occur with intravenous nutrition, liver disorders, or renal dys-function. The use of synthetic retinoid therapy during preg-nancy should be avoided. Serum retinol or the retinol binding protein transthyretin ratio can be used to assess deficiency. Retinyl ester levels can be used to establish toxicity. Recommendations To avoid deficiency or toxicity, a careful approach to dietary intake should take into account the current recommendations for healthy people. Considerations and special monitoring are needed for hospitalized individuals. Recommended intakes of vitamin A (mcg/d RAE) can be seen in Table A2.1. Appendix 2 References 1. Green HN, Mellanby E.

Fessler, MS, RD, CNSC Introduction Thiamine (also spelled thiamin) was the first B vitamin to be discovered and is also known as vitamin B1 and aneurin. Thiamine pyrophosphate is a coenzyme in the metabolism of carbohydrates and branched-chain amino acids. 1,2 Thiamine is water soluble, stable at acidic pH, and unstable in alkaline solutions and with exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. 3 The major food sources of thiamine are various whole, enriched, or fortified grain products and pork. Other sources include legumes, poultry, processed meats, and soy-based meat substitutes. 1,3 Metabolism and Functions Thiamine functions in several phosphorylated forms, chiefly as the coenzyme form thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), is sometimes referred (TDP). Thiamine is necessary for decarboxylation of -keto transketolation reactions of hexose and pentose phosphates. 1,4 Thiamine is absorbed mainly in the jejunum, by carrier-medi-ated active transport at lower concentrations and by passive diffusion at higher concentrations. Only a small percentage of a high oral dose is absorbed. Absorption declines at a dose above 5 mg. 2 Thiamine is carried in erythrocytes and plasma2 and is not stored to a significant extent in any tissues but is in more significant amounts in muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and brain. 3 Urinary excretion is increased when serum levels ele- vate and decreased when serum levels are low, with maximum excretion 2 hours after oral intake. The biological half-life of thiamine has been determined to be 9-18 days, and the adult body is thought to contain approximately 30 mg. 1 Thiamine Deficiency and Toxicity The thiamine deficiency disease has long been known as \"beriberi.\" Thiamine deficiency symptoms include anorexia, weight loss, mental abnormalities, muscle weakness, and enlarged heart. Muscle wasting is seen in \"dry\" beriberi, and \"wet\" beriberi is characterized by the presence of edema due to congestive heart failure. 1 Prolonged mild thiamine defi- ciency can lead to peripheral nerve damage.5 by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 472 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) Thiamine deficiency as it occurs in modern industrialized countries is better known as an acute neurologic disorder called Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Symptoms of WE include opthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. 5 Without prompt treat- ment, WE progresses to irreversible brain damage known as Korsakoff's psychosis and can also result in coma or death. Korsakoff's syndrome is characterized by chronic severe loss of working memory or amnesia of recent events, with memory deficits of events up to months prior. 5 WE has been historically found in chronic alcoholic patients but has also been reported in patients who were given parenteral nutrition (PN) without mul-tivitamins. Reasons for not using multiple vitamins in PN in these cases were attributed to iatrogenic error, shortage of mul-tivitamin product, and, in Japan, cost issues resulting from a national health insurance policy change. 4,6 WE has been reported in other malnourished patients such as those who have undergone gastrointestinal surgery and in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum, small bowel obstruc-tion, anorexia nervosa, gastrointestinal disorders, and various cancers. In some cancers, thiamine is used by rapidly growing tumors, and some chemotherapeutic drugs can interfere with thiamine function. 5,7 Since thiamine is lost in dialysate, poorly nourished renal patients on dialysis are at risk for thiamine deficiency. Patients with magnesium deficiency due to chronic diuretic use are also at risk, as magnesium is a cofactor in tran-sketolase reactions and in conversion of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate. 5 Because intestinal absorption is limited, the recommended treatment for WE is intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration of thiamine. 5 In a recent study, 100 mg of IV thiamine for 3 days normalized neurologic symptoms of WE in 6 of 7 patients who received PN without multivitamins, 4 but higher doses are advised. Patients with suspected or diagnosed WE should receive 500 mg of IV thiamine hydrochloride 3 times per day for 2-3 days and, if favorable response occurs, followed with 250 mg thiamine per day, given IV or IM, for 3-5 days. 5 Prophylactic treatment with 250 mg of IM thiamine per day for 3-5 days has been recently recommended for malnour - ished patients at risk for WE.5 Those who are deficient in thia- mine are most likely deficient in several other vitamins, and thus treatment with IV multivitamin mixtures is prudent. In the United Kingdom, for example, a high-potency B-complex for - mulation (Pabrinex) has been used in the treatment of WE. 8 Erythrocyte transketolase activity and erythrocyte TPP are 2 tests that have been used to measure thiamine status. Erythrocyte transketolase activity is low in thiamine-depleted individuals and increases after the addition of TPP to lysed erythrocytes, but the test has limitations in that it has not correlated well with thiamine intake in several studies, and there are likely genetic and other individual differences that affect enzyme activity. 1 Erythrocyte TPP declines at a sim- ilar rate as in other tissues in a thiamine-deficient state. Measurement of erythrocyte TPP itself has been found to be a more consistent and specific indicator, with normal range of 70-90 nmol/L. 1 A whole-blood TPP test is also available, with the normal range listed as 74-222 nmol/L9 or 80-150 nmol/L.10 Magnetic resonance imaging is currently the most useful method to confirm WE. 5 Data are lacking on adverse effects of excessive oral thia- mine intake, and thus a tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been determined. 2 Parenteral thiamine is considered safe, yet there is a low risk of serious allergic reaction. Thus, it is recommended that parenteral thiamine be diluted in 100 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution and infused over a period of 30 minutes and that treatment be done in a facility equipped to treat anaphylactic reaction. 5 Requirements for Healthy Individuals The recommended requirements for thiamine have been deter - mined by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and published in 1998. 1 The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for thiamine for adults is 1.1 mg (females) to 1.2 mg (males) per day and 1.4 mg per day for pregnancy and lactation. Criteria used for establishing adult thiamine requirements included the amount needed to main-tain erythrocyte transketolase activity, urinary thiamine excre-tion, and other information. The requirements for children and teenagers were established by extrapolation methods using adult data. The RDA for children is 0.5 mg/d for ages 1-3 years, 0.6 mg/d for ages 4-8 years, 0.9 mg/d for ages 9-13 years, and 1-1.2 mg/d for ages 14-18 years. The Adequate Intake (AI) of thiamine for infants was determined by using information on infants fed breast milk from well-nourished mothers. The AI is 0.2 mg/d for infants aged 0-6 months and 0.3 mg/d for infants aged 6-12 months. 1,2 Requirement Modifications in Specific Conditions The RDA for thiamine is 1.4 mg/d for pregnancy and lactation. Because of its function in carbohydrate metabolism, thia-mine needs are likely related to energy utilization and body size. Thiamine needs are higher for patients on dialysis, those with malabsorption, or during pregnancy or lactation with more than 1 infant. 1 Thiamine Content in Current PN and Enteral Nutrition Regimens Aside from the need for parenteral thiamine and B-complex supplements for use in deficiency states, there are no data to suggest that new products are needed for PN regimens, except, of course, not to exclude thiamine. Current adult parenteral multivitamin products in the U.S. contain 6 mg of thiamine hydrochloride per daily dose. 11-13 Other products, available in Europe, contain 3.1 and 3.51 mg thiamine per dose.14,15 Pediatric parenteral multivitamin solutions in the U.S. provide 1.2 mg thiamine per daily dose. 13,16 All of these products meet or exceed the RDA or AI levels. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 473 Enteral nutrition (EN) formulas in the U.S. provide ade- quate thiamine to meet or exceed RDA or AI levels, if suffi- cient amounts of formula are ingested to meet energy needs. Standard adult EN formulas contain 1.6-4 mg thiamine per 1500-2000 kcal. Standard pediatric 1.7-2.5 mg thiamine per 1000 kcal. 17,18 Standard formulas for term infants contain 0.06-0.1 mg thiamine per 100 kcal.19,20 Formula for premature infants contains 0.175-0.25 mg thia-mine per 100 kcal. 20,21 One recent study confirmed that current PN and EN regi- mens provide adequate thiamine for premature infants.22 A recent Japanese study confirms a significant decline in blood levels of thiamine in children receiving PN without thiamine. 23 Recommendations Thiamine is of critical importance during enteral and parenteral feeding, especially in malnourished patients. Multivitamins, specifically thiamine, should never be omitted in PN regimens. Standard adult and pediatric multivitamins for IV infusion provide greater than the established RDA or AI dose of thiamine. Standard EN formulas generally provide greater than or equal to the RDA dose of thiamine when providing full energy needs. Supplemental parenteral thiamine or B-complex product, in addition to that provided in standard EN or PN, should be provided for patients who are symp - tomatic or at high risk for thiamine deficiency and those at risk for refeeding syndrome in general. Supplemental parenteral thiamine and/or B-complex vitamins, in addition to that provided in standard EN or PN, should be administered to patients at risk or symptomatic for WE.

Jeejeebhoy, MBBS, PhD, FRCPC Introduction The need for any vitamin can be expressed in 3 different ways. The traditional way was called Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), which is established and periodically revised by the Food and Nutrition Board. For the labeling of foods, the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) was established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was based initially on the high-est 1968 RDA for each nutrient, to ensure that needs were met for all age groups. The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) are the most recent set of dietary recommendations established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, 1997-2001. They replace previous RDAs and may be the basis for eventually updating the RDIs. These definitions need to be kept in mind when the intake of patients on parenteral nutri-tion (PN) is being considered. The currently available paren-teral multivitamin mixture available in North America provides riboflavin 3.6 mg/d and niacin as niacinamide 40 mg/d. The pediatric formulation provides 0.56 mg of riboflavin per day. Riboflavin (B2) Metabolic Effect Riboflavin is a dinucleotide (FAD). These compounds combine with proteins to form enzymes called flavoproteins. These enzymes are concerned with dehydrogenation and oxidation reactions involving pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and amino acids. In the pro-cess, the flavin becomes reduced by accepting hydrogen. The reduced form is reoxidized and again available to accept hydro-gen. It also acts as part of the electron transfer chain.Reliable assessment of deficiency and toxicity. There are 3 methods to assess riboflavin status. 1. Urinary excretion. The urine riboflavin should be at least 80 mcg/g creatinine. In deficiency, it falls below 27 mcg/g creatinine. However, catabolic states increase riboflavin excretion as do drugs such as antibiotics and phenothiazines, making urinary excretion less reliable. 2. Erythrocyte riboflavin levels can be measured and used to detect deficiency and should be at least 10 mcg/dL red cells. 3. The most reliable method assessing riboflavin status is by the glutathione reductase activity in red blood cells before and after the addition of FAD. The increase in activity by this addition is an index of deficiency. Less than 20% (ratio <1.2) is acceptable, 1.2-1.4 is subnormal, and >1.4 is a deficient state. Riboflavin Toxicity Has Not Been Described Clinical effects of deficiency. In a deficiency state, there may be sore throat, stomatitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis of the face, trunk, and scrotum. In addition, photophobia and vascularization of the cornea have been observed. Marrow aplasia and a normocytic normochromic anemia may occur. Normal Requirements The oral intake should be 0.6 mg/1000 kcal. Hence, in an aver - age adult, intake should be 1.2-1.6 mg/d. For patients receiv-ing PN, the American Medical Association (AMA) 1 recommends 3.6 mg/d in adults. In other studies, 1.8-10 mg has been used and shown to be adequate biochemically. 2,3 In patients on home PN, infusion of the current formulation given daily maintained biochemical stability but when given 3 times a week caused deficiency. 4 Modifications for Cirrhosis, Cancer, Renal Failure, Trauma, Sepsis, and Burns In critically ill patients, the addition of 10 mg of riboflavin per day maintained normal levels when measured on average 16 days after start of PN. 3 On the other hand, in cancer patients, biochemical deficiency was noted despite 7.2 mg/d of riboflavin. 5 Modification for Gender and the Elderly There is no effect of age on riboflavin requirements, but the DRI for women is about 0.2 mg lower than it is for men. Relevance to Pregnancy, Lactation, and Pediatric Populations During pregnancy and lactation, an additional 0.3-0.5 mg/d should be given, making the total intake 1.5-2.1 mg/d. In infants, 2 mL of the pediatric formulation, giving 0.56 mg/d, maintained riboflavin balance. 6 Niacin Metabolic Effects Niacin in the form of nicotinamide is a component of 2 nucle-otides. These nucleotides are nicotinamide adenine mono-(NAD) and di-(NADP) nucleotides. They combine with various carrier proteins to form enzymes concerned with electron transfer reactions related to energy metabolism. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 475 Reliable Assessment of Deficiency and Toxicity Blood levels of niacin are not a reliable index of niacin sta- tus. 1N-methylnicotinamide and its 2-pyridone derivative are measured in the urine to assess niacin status. The excretion of <0.8 mg 1N-methynicotinamide per 24 hours is a sign of deficiency. Another way of assessing status is the ratio of 1N-methynicotinamide and its 2-pyridone derivative. A ratio of <1.0 is a sign of deficiency. Clinical Effects of Deficiency Clinical niacin deficiency is called pellagra and is due to both a poor intake of niacin and to a deficiency or reduced conver - sion of tryptophan to niacin. Clinical deficiency is the result of a complex disorder involving not only a lack of niacin and tryptophan but also an excessive leucine intake, which inhibits the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. There must also be concurrent deficiencies of riboflavin, thiamine, and pyridox-ine, which are needed for this conversion. Pellagra presents as a wasting disease with dermatitis of the exposed areas due to photosensitivity. Fatigue, insomnia, and apathy are followed by confusion, hallucinations, disorientation, and finally psy-chosis. Widespread mucosal inflammation causes glossitis, stomatitis, vaginitis, and diarrhea. Requirements Tryptophan is converted to niacin in the body, and therefore it is necessary to define niacin intake as niacin equivalents (NEs). Sixty milligrams of tryptophan is equivalent to 1 mg niacin. This conversion requires the presence of thiamine, riboflavin, and pyridoxine. The recommended oral intake is 6.6 mg of NE per 1000 kcal. Thus, about 13-18 mg/d should be taken by adults. For PN, the AMA recommends 40 mg/d in adults. 1 In home PN patients, 100 mg twice weekly avoids deficiency.7 However, daily infusion of the current formulation is required to main-tain normal levels of niacin. 4 Modifications for Cirrhosis, Cancer, Renal Failure, Trauma, Sepsis, and Burns Cancer patients receiving PN had biochemical deficiency of niacin despite receiving 40 mg/d. In the same study, niacin status was measured in only 1 patient receiving 80 mg/d and was normal. 5 Modification for Gender and the Elderly There is no modification for age. The DRI for women is set at about 1-2 mg/d lower than it is in men.Figure A4.1. Comparison of parenteral intake with Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), Reference Daily Intake (RDI), and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). Relevance to Pregnancy, Lactation, and Pediatric Populations During pregnancy and lactation, an additional 2 and 5 NE/d is respectively recommended. For those aged 0-1 year, adequate intake is 2-4 mg/d; mg/d; age 9-13 years, 9-12 mg; and 14 mg and above, it is in the adult range. Comparison of Intravenous Intake With the RDA, RDI, and DRI The parenteral intake based on available formulations easily meets the requirements based on RDA, RDI, and DRI (Figure A4.1). Conclusions There are no good controlled studies to evaluate the exact need of riboflavin and niacin in PN. However, the available data suggest that the current formulation will meet requirements in stable patients. In critically ill patients, riboflavin intake of 10 mg, which is 3 times the amount in the usual dose of the cur - rent formulation, will maintain biochemical stability. In patients with cancer, it appears that much larger doses of ribo-flavin and niacin may be required to maintain normal bio-chemistry. In these patients, further studies need to be done.

Appendix 5 Pantothenic Acid Peggy Borum, PhD Introduction Pantothenic acid is a water-soluble B vitamin that functions as a component of coenzyme A.1 Metabolic Function Since coenzyme A is involved in many aspects of metabo-lism, including fatty acid metabolism, pantothenic acid is important in most areas of metabolism. 1 Clinical and basic science research publications are somewhat limited com-pared with many other micronutrients. However, recently developed analytical methods have been used to expand our understanding of the metabolic roles of pantothenic acid. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is associated with increased fatty acid catabolism and is com-monly targeted for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. PPAR activation with fibrate medication in healthy human volun-teers was associated with greater than a 5-fold decrease in urinary pantothenic acid excretion, suggesting that it may prove useful as an indicator of PPAR-induced fatty acid -oxidation in humans. 2 In male rats, pantothenic acid sup- plementation stimulates the ability of adrenal cells to secrete corticosterone and progesterone and induces adrenal hyper - responsiveness to ACTH stimulation. 3 New clinical uses of pantothenic acid are also being investigated. Although more data from randomized controlled studies are needed, there are results suggesting that pantothenic acid combined with vitamin C contributes to the healing and treatment of surgi-cal wounds. 4 Reliable Assessment Methods of Deficiency and Toxicity Pantothenic acid deficiency is very rarely observed in humans. Signs and symptoms of deficiency may include irritability and restlessness, fatigue, apathy, malaise, sleep disturbances, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, hypoglycemia, increased sensitivity to insulin, and neurological symptoms such as numbness, paresthesias, muscle cramps, and stagger - ing gait. 1 Requirement in Parenteral Nutrition A Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) has not been set due to insufficient available scientific evidence. Daily Adequate Intake (AI) of pantothenic acid levels has been established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute of Medicine based on pantothenic acid sufficient to replace urinary excretion. No adverse effects have been asso-ciated with pantothenic acid. 1 Parenteral nutri- tion (PN) pantothenic acid recommendations are derived from the deliberations of expert panels. 5,6 Pantothenic acid is stable in a 3-L plastic bag of PN while stored in darkness at 2-8\u00b0C for 96 hours or during 24 hours of simulated infusion initiated immediately after mixing. 7 Modifications Due to Gender, Age, Pregnancy, and Lactation Several different groups of patients, including children, have been maintained on PN with commercial intravenous multivi-tamin products with no evidence of pantothenic acid defi-ciency or toxicity. 8,9 Elevated blood concentrations of pantothenic acid in patients receiving PN are usually associ-ated with the presence of renal disease. 10 Recommendations Pantothenic Acid Population Recommendation Reference Oral nutrition: adults AI = 5 mg/d 1 Oral nutrition: pregnant females AI = 6 mg/d 1 Oral nutrition: breastfeeding femalesAI = 7 mg/d 1 AI = 1.7 mg/d 1Oral AI = 1.8 AI = 2 AI = 3 AI = 4 children, 14-18 y AI = 5 mg/d 1PN: adults 15 mg/d 5 PN: term infants and children 5 mg/d 6 PN: preterm infants and children 2.5 mg/kg/d Adequate Intake; PN, parenteral nutrition. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N.

Shils ME, Baker H, Frank O. Blood vitamin levels of long-term adult home total parenteral nutrition patients: the efficacy of ChB, PHD, FRCP, FRCPath Introduction Vitamin B6 consists of several related compounds, including pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine, and pyridoxamine and (PN) formulations, pyridoxine is supplied as pyridoxine hydrochloride because this compound is more stable than other forms of the vitamin. 1 It is phosphorylated to its active form, pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), by the liver, the site of primary metabolism. 2,3 In a study of nor - mal volunteers infused with vitamin B6, plasma steady-state concentration was reached within 30 minutes, and the serum half-life was only a few minutes 4; only 6.7% of the administered dose was detected unmetabolized in the urine. If active metabo-lites were included, the urine amount was somewhat greater. Metabolic Effects Pyridoxine hydrochloride is an inactive compound and is metabolized in the liver to the active moieties PLP, the primary form bound to serum and pyridoxamine-5-phosphate (PMP). 2,3 PLP undergoes the liver to acid, which is excreted.5 PLP functions as a coenzyme for aminotransferases that catalyze the formation of -keto acids from their respective amino acids. PLP is also important in the hepatic transsulfura-tion pathway (via the PLP-dependent enzymes -synthase and cystathionine well requires PLP-dependent active in both and gluconeogenesis and is the coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase. Vitamin B 6 may also play a role in lipid metabolism and in the maintenance of normal immune function, although these roles remain some-what speculative. PLP-dependent -aminolevulinate synthase is important for heme biosynthesis. As with other B vitamins, exposure of vitamin B 6 to sun- light leads to destruction,6 although this has not been shown in all studies.7 Reliable Assessment for Deficiency and Toxicity Vitamin B 6 deficiency has been associated with seborrheic dermatitis,8 microcytic anemia,9 and confusion.12 A glove and stocking sensory neuropathy has also been reported in B6 toxicity with ingestion of large doses (1-6 g/d for 2-40 months) of pyridoxine.13,14 The Food and Nutrition Board set a tolerable upper limit of 100 mg/d14 in adults. Toxicity has not been reported from parenteral admin- istration of currently recommended doses. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the primary method for determination of vitamin B6 in both plasma and tissues.15 The plasma concentration of PLP reflects the hepatic <20 nmol/L is associated with vitamin B6 deficiency,14,18 although at this level, some individuals will exhibit no signs of deficiency.19,20 As with choline,21 plasma PLP is very high in the fetus and slowly decreases to normal adult concentrations over the first year of life. 22 The concentration of PLP at which defi- ciency occurs in the neonate is unknown. Erythrocyte PLP reflects plasma PLP except in individuals who have received very high doses. 23 Plasma PL and PLP are more affected by critical illness than red or white cell concentrations, suggesting that intracellular concentrations are a better measure of status in such patients. 24 Whole-blood vitamin B6 concentrations (normal >40 nmol/L) fluctuate with the menstrual cycle.25 by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 478 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) Significant fluctuation has also been observed with mea- surements of the activation of erythrocyte aspartate and ala- PLP (normal <1.25 to <1.8, respectively), 26 thereby their Urinary 4-pyridoxic acid excretion (normal >3 \u00b5mol/d) or urinary total vitamin B 6 (normal >0.5 \u00b5mol/d) reflects recent intake rather than a deficiency or toxicity state. 14 An increase in plasma homocysteine following a methionine load has also been used to indicate vitamin B6 deficiency (normal: <1.25-1.8).27 However, high plasma homocysteine concentration may be related to other factors, such as choline deficiency, in the PN patient. 28 Erythrocyte glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase activity also status. 29 With regard to PN, serum PLP concentration was decreased in 3 of 30 patients who required nightly PN and were awaiting intestinal transplantation, although no identifiable symptoms were present. 30 A low level was not reported when the blood samples were obtained following the discontinuation of the nightly PN. Pyridoxine hydrochloride, 2.4 mg/d, was insuffi-cient to maintain normal serum PLP in a group of adult South African patients who required prolonged PN, 31 although Howard et al32 found that urinary 4-pyridoxic acid excretion remained normal at this dose. Three milligrams of daily intra-venous pyridoxine hydrochloride was sufficient to maintain normal pyridoxine status in a group of Japanese adult patients requiring PN, 33 and a study of long-term home PN-requiring patients indicated this dose was sufficient to maintain normal plasma concentrations. 34 Whole-blood pyridoxine concentrations were elevated in some patients who received 4 mg daily,35 although at this dose, Inculet et al36 found that urinary excretion remained normal but became substantially elevated when the dose was doubled. Urinary excretion probably reflects the infused dose. Hariz et al 37 also found that 4.5 mg/d of pyridoxine maintained some- what elevated vitamin B6 concentration in the blood of chil- dren who received home PN after a week of therapy, although neither the form of vitamin B 6 nor urinary excretion was reported. It is to be noted that Shils et al34 found that the amount of pyridoxine contained in an intravenous multivitamin formu-lation was nearly double that indicated on the label. Based on the above results, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation to increase vitamin B 6 supply to 6 mg/d during PN seems to lack experimental sup-port. 38 However, such an intake will not be harmful and will ensure an adequate vitamin B6 intake in those patients who are already depleted or who have a high amino acid intake. Modification for Cirrhosis, Renal Failure, Trauma, Sepsis, and Burns Renal insufficiency has been associated with decreased vita- min B6 status as indicated by decreased plasma PLP, elevated urinary pyridoxic acid (PA), and elevated post-methionine load homocysteine concentration. 39,40Modification for Gender and the Elderly The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) was reduced in 1998 from that recommended in 1989 to an estimated average require-ment of 1.1 mg/d and a DRI of 1.3 mg/d for both male and female adults, with slightly higher intakes recommended for the elderly (1.7 mg/d for men >51 years and 1.5 mg/d for women >51 years). 14 Relevance to Pregnancy, Lactation, and the Pediatric Population A study in 6 preterm infants who received 63% of their energy requirements via PN indicated that a pyridoxine dose of 394 \u00b1 243 mcg/100 kcal/d (equivalent to current recommendations) maintains normal serum pyridoxal concentrations in blood samples obtained during PN infusion. 41 The American Medical Association-Nutrition Advisory Group (AMA-NAG) recommendations indicated that chil-dren <10 kg should receive 10% of the general pediatric dose per kilogram. 42 At a later meeting sponsored by the FDA, experts noted that term infants and children up to age 11 years could all receive the same vitamin dose, which is somewhat more than the RDA for 0-12 months and slightly less than the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for older children. 42 Using the AMA-NAG recommendations, Moore et al43 reported that term infants and children main- tained normal plasma glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase activities. Elevated serum pyridoxic acid concentrations have been described with doses of 300-700 mcg/d. 44 For infants, the adequate oral intake (AI) was based on the amount of vita-min B 6 in human milk. This dose was extrapolated, based on expected weight for older infants (7-12 months).14 For older children, estimated average requirements (EARs) and RDAs are extrapolated based on adult data. The current RDA is 1.9 mg/d for pregnancy and 2 mg/d for lactation. 14 Drug and Nutrient Interactions PL kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of vitamin requires zinc as a cofactor. Niacin, folate, and carnitine require vitamin B 6 for their biosynthesis and metabolism. B6 is antagonized by hydralazine cause increased excretion of pyri-doxine in urine. Vitamin B 6 requirement in such individuals is therefore probably higher than the recommendations for a healthy population, but data are not available to identify the requirement more precisely. Conclusions and Clinical Recommendations The current recommended dose of 6 mg daily for adults and extrapolated pediatric dosing appears adequate and appropriate. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N.

Greene H, Smith A, Murrell J, et al. HPLC measurement of pyridoxine vitamins in infants receiving Enteral FRCP Introduction Vitamin B12 or cobalamin is essential for normal blood forma- tion and normal neurologic function.1 In the United States, the median adult B12 intake from food is 5 mcg/d for men and 3.5 mcg/d for women. Since B12 occurs only in animal products, strict vegetarians (vegans) may develop B12 deficiency unless they take a supplement. Absorption of dietary B12 is a complicated process. It depends on gastric acid and pepsin to release food-bound B12. The released B12 binds to R proteins secreted by the salivary glands and gastric mucosa. In the alkaline pH of the duode-num, pancreatic proteases digest the R proteins, and liberated B 12 binds to intrinsic factor (IF). IF is a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric parietal cells. The B12-IF complex travels down the small intestine and attaches to specific receptors in the dis-tal ileum. The B 12-IF is internalized into the ileal enterocyte; B12 is then broken off and enters the circulation bound to trans- cobalamin (TC) carrier proteins I, II, or III. Most circulating B 12 (>80%) is attached to TC I, which seems to be physiologi- cally inert; 10%-15% of circulating B12 is attached to TC II. Tissues have TC II receptors, allowing them to capture B12 as needed.2 The liver takes up 50% of dietary B12 and provides the main storage site. The average B12 hepatic content is 1.0 pg/g of tissue. The total body B12 content is 1-3 mg.A number of factors listed in Table A7.1 can disrupt B12 absorption. Very large doses of sublingual or oral crystalline B 12 (500-1000 mcg/d) are \u00b11% absorbed by mass action even if IF is absent. The sublingual and oral routes seem equally effective and may be preferred to a monthly intramuscular injection. 3-6 Patients with tobacco amblyopia or patients with B12 deficiency who smoke have increased urinary thiocyanate losses and should receive a new form of B12, hydroxocobala- min, which is a potent cyanide antagonist. This compound is currently available only in a parenteral form. Cyanocobalamin, the traditional salt, is used in oral, sublingual, and parenteral multivitamin formulations and risks worsening tobacco/B 12 ophthalmic symptoms.7 Vitamin B12 has an enterohepatic cycle. Each day, about 1.4 \u00b5g B12 is secreted into the bile, and approximately half of this is recaptured if IF is present. If IF is absent or the distal ileum has been resected, clinical B 12 deficiency can develop in a few months. In comparison, B12 deficiency in vegans develops over many years. In normal circumstances, B12 is excreted chiefly in the stool. Fecal B12 reflects unabsorbed B12 from food or bile, desquamated intestinal cells, and B12 synthesized by colonic bacteria. After a parenteral injection of B12, if the circulating vitamin exceeds TC binding capacity, the excess is secreted in the urine. Vitamin B 12 toxicity has not been described. Metabolic Function Vitamin B12 is the cofactor for 2 enzymes. With methionine synthetase, B12 transfers a methyl group from circulating methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, forming tetrahydro-folate and methionine. Tetrahydrofolate is deoxy-ribonucleic mutase, adenosyl B 12 L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl CoA. hematologic effect of B12 deficiency is identical to folate deficiency since both vitamins are involved in methyl transfer, a step toward DNA synthesis. The defect is most apparent in rapidly dividing cells and in the bone marrow, gut lining, and cervix mucosa. In the bone marrow, red cell precursors are large with primitive nuclei and are called megaloblasts. The peripheral blood shows anemia with mac-rocytosis of red blood cells, neutropenia with hyper - segmented polymorphs, and thrombocytopenia. Deficient Table Factors Impairing atrophic gastritis, or pernicious Chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis: pancreatic proteases Bacterial over B12-IF complex Ileal resection or ileitis: eliminate or B12-IF receptors Genetic absence TC II: distribution IF, intrinsic factor; TC, transcobalamin. by Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 481 patients are pale, fatigued, and short of breath. They may complain of a sore tongue, loss of appetite, flatulence, and constipation due to abnormal functioning of the macrocytic bowel. No gynecologic symptoms have been described. The hematologic and bowel symptoms improve after a few weeks of B 12 therapy. The neurologic effects of B12 deficiency develop more slowly and reflect a lack of adenosyl B12. Twenty-five percent of patients with the neurologic syndrome have no hematologic manifestations. The clinical picture may include a peripheral sensory neuropathy with tingling, numbness, and reduced vibration and position sense, especially in the legs; motor weakness with gait disturbances; and central deficits such as loss of concentration and memory, leading to premature dementia. Occasionally, there are visual changes, impotency, and loss of bowel and bladder control. Lindenbaum et al 8 and later Beck9 described neuropsychiatric disorders caused by cobalamin deficiency in the absence of anemia and macrocyto-sis. This suggests all neuropsychiatric patients should be screened for B 12 deficiency. Neurological deficits come on slowly, and full reversibility with B12 treatment is less certain. Reliable Assessment Methods Evaluation of B12 starts with relatively nonspecific hemato- logic tests such as hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, red cell count, and mean red cell volume. Serum or plasma B 12 levels are the most common specific test ordered, but they develop late after tissue levels are already depleted. Plasma or serum values can be normal despite tissue deficiency because of recent intake. In parenteral patients receiving daily B 12 infu- sions, serum B12 levels are hard to interpret. The lower limit of serum B12 for adults is 120-180 serum values are 300-900 pg/mL. The value varies with the laboratory method used. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) is cur - rently the most sensitive and specific test of B 12 depletion. It measures adenosyl-B12 function. If patients with established B12 deficiency are supplemented inadequately, MMA rises in 95%, but serum B12 is low (<200 pg/mL) in only 69%. False MMA positives are seen in severe renal failure or major vol-ume depletion. MMA specificity is confirmed when the high value subsides with B 12 supplementation. Elevated homocysteine and increased urinary excretion of formiminoglutamic acid after histidine loading (FIGLU test) are seen in both B 12 and folic acid deficiency and reflect the methyl group transfer function of these 2 vitamins. As a result, these tests are not as specific as MMA for pinpointing B 12 depletion. Vitamin B12 Requirements in Parenteral Nutrition Adult parenteral multivitamin products provide 5 mcg/d of crystalline cyanocobalamin. This is similar to the oral B 12 Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), which, however, is only 50% absorbed. 10 Serum B12 tends to be elevated in patients receiving chronic parenteral nutrition (PN), usually in the 700- to 900-pg/mL range. 10 This might suggest that paren- teral 5 mcg/d is excessive, but there are several good reasons, summarized in Table A7.2, to continue this generous dose. Elkhatib et al 11 speculated that high serum B12 in long-term PN patients might be a marker for intestinal failure-associated liver disease. They studied 13 patients with short bowel syn-drome (<200 cm residual small bowel) and complete terminal ileum resection who had been on PN for 6.1 \u00b1 3 years. All patients had at least 1 liver biopsy for presumed intestinal fail-ure-associated liver disease. The biopsies were evaluated and scored for the degree of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. There was no correlation between serum B 12 concentration and liver pathology, nor was there any correlation with hepatic chemistries taken just prior to the liver biopsy. Thus, in these circumstances, the high serum B 12 was not a marker of intesti- nal failure-associated liver disease. Gender.Women have higher serum B12 values and higher transcobalamin levels compared with men.12 However, this does not appear to indicate a higher requirement for B12 in women. Age. Tables 4-7 in the main section show recommended B12 intakes enterally and parenterally for neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and adults. The liver of well-nour - ished babies contains only 25-30 mcg B12. Breast milk from vegan mothers tends to be low (0.23 mcg/d), and these infants may develop increased urinary MMA concentra-tions at 2-14 months, 13 indicating B12 deficiency. The pedi- atric parenteral dose is generous and will certainly build pediatric liver stores rapidly. There are no known adverse consequences of providing this generous amount of B 12. Pregnancy. Serum B12 concentrations decline in early pregnancy, and by the sixth month, they are about half the nonpregnancy concentration. This may reflect the mother's expanded intravascular volume. In the third trimester, trans-cobalmin II increases to about a third more than in the Table A7.2. Reasons to Continue 5 mcg/d of Vitamin B12 as the Adult Parenteral Multivitamin Dose Although this dose results in serum B12 levels at upper limits of normal, there is no evidence for a B12 toxicity syndrome. High serum levels may reflect daily parenteral B12 infusion rather than tissue levels that are probably normal. Parenteral B12 is delivered into the systemic circulation rather than the portal system, and thus first-pass uptake of 50% by the liver and binding to appropriate transcobalamin (TC) carrier proteins are likely to be less efficient. In addition, 25% of systemic blood \"first passes\" the kidneys. Immediate loss of significant amounts of B 12 in the urine is probable. B12 secreted into the bile may not be recaptured because of loss of ileal receptors. Smokers have increased urinary B12 losses as thiocyanate. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 482 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) nonpregnant women. The RDA for pregnancy is 2.6 mcg B12 per day. Again, this is more than covered by the usual parenteral dose of 5 mcg B12 per 0.33 mcg B12 per day in breast milk. This amount decreases to 0.25 mcg B12 per day after 6 months. The RDA for lactation is 2.8 mcg B12 per day. This again is more than met in women supported by PN (5 mcg B12 per day). Recommendations for B12 in Parenteral NutritionThe current dose of 5 mcg/d for adults generously meets requirements. When patients with short bowel syndrome are gradually weaned off PN, B 12 adequacy needs to be checked at interval since most of these patients have lost their ileum and therefore B 12-IF receptors. Alternatively, supplements can be started from the onset of weaning. If the patient smokes, hydroxoco-balamin, rather than cyanocobalamin, is the compound of choice. Commercial sublingual, oral, and multivitamin prepa-rations currently use hydroxocobalamin, and it would be desir - able if this can be changed. Appendix 7 References 1.

Am 8 FRCP Introduction Folate functions as a coenzyme in single-carbon transfer reac- tions and exists in many chemical forms. It has a critical role in pyrimidine, purine, and amino acid metabolism. Food folate (pteroyl polyglutamate) consists of a p-ami- nobenzoic acid molecule linked at one end to a pteridine ring and at the other to 2-7 glutamate molecules. This glutamate side chain is highly polar, and folate is not absorbed by the small intestine until most of the side chain is removed by folate conjugases, which are secreted by small bowel entero-cytes. Once the polyglutamate is converted to the monoglu-tamate, folate is actively transported into the enterocyte by a saturable pH-dependent process. The bioavailability of food folate (polyglutamate) is about 50%. All folate supplements are in the monoglutamate form, which is 100% bioavail-able. 1 In 1998, the United States made fortification of cereal grains with folate monoglutamate mandatory to ensure an intake of at least 400 mcg/d. This was done to reduce the incidence of neural tube birth defects (NTD) in the in utero infants. 1 This fortification appears to have decreased NTD by 50%.1 Total body folate is approximately 22 mg in healthy adults, and half of this is stored in the liver.2 Folate circulates primar - ily as methyltetrahydrofolate (methyl-THF) bound to protein carriers. It is transported into cells by a specific receptor. In the cell, folate is attached to membrane carriers or folate binding protein-mediated systems. 3 These transport systems are not saturated under physiologic conditions, so folate influx into tissues can be expected when supplements are given and plasma folate rises. In the cell, folate is stored as the polygluta-mate form. Folate catabolism starts with cleavage of the to monoglutamate, which is then acetylated and excreted in the urine. Folate is also excreted into the bile, but much of this is reabsorbed. Fecal folate losses reflect unab-sorbed and folate syn-thesized by the intestinal microflora. 4 There are no data on gut losses in extreme short bowel patients maintained on long-term home parenteral nutrition (PN). by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 483 Metabolic Function The main function of folate compounds is to transfer 1-carbon moieties, such as methyl and formyl groups, to organic com-pounds. These 1-carbon moieties are chiefly obtained from serine, which in turn is converted to glycine. The most critical l-carbon transfers of folate are (1) the conversion of homocys-teine to methionine, (2) the addition of C 2 and C8 in purine synthesis, and (3) the methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to form thymidylic acid in pyrimidine synthesis. This last reac-tion is unique in that dihydrofolate (DHF) is formed rather than tetrahydrofolate (THF). DHF must be reduced by dihy-drofolate reductase before it can reenter the donor pool. A number of drugs, such as methotrexate, pyrimethamine, and trimethoprim, dihydrofolate reductase, inducing Table A8.1 summarizes the many causes of folate deficiency. The clinical presentation reflects the defect in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, especially in rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow and in intestinal and cervi-cal epithelia. Cytoplasmic development is normal, but impaired deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and delayed cell division result in large cells with primitive nuclei. In the bone marrow, these are most striking in the red cell series and termed megaloblasts. These cells eventually lose their nuclei and move into the circulation as macrocytes. Other hemato-poietic cells are also affected. Polymorphs develop increased nuclear segmentations, and platelets are reduced in number. Folate-deficient patients are pale, fatigued, and short of breath. They may also have a sore tongue, angular cheilosis, loss of appetite, flatulence, and constipation related to their macrocytic bowel. All these symptoms subside after a few weeks of folate therapy. This clinical picture is identical to the hematologic effects of vitamin B 12 deficiency. This reflects the fact that folate and B12 are both involved in the conversion of methyl-THF to THF, which then receives 2 carbon moi-eties to form N 5,10 methylene THF (the active form for purine and pyrimidine synthesis). Folate toxicity has not been described. Reliable Assessment Methods Erythrocyte folate is the best test for long-term folate defi-ciency, and it correlates fairly well with folate concentrations in other tissues such as the liver. 5 Deficiency is present when erythrocyte folate is below 140 ng/mL. Serum folate less than 4 ng/mL indicates a negative folate balance, but it does not distinguish between a transient reduction in folate intake and chronic folate deficiency. The normal serum concentration is 6-20 ng/mL. Plasma homocysteine rises with folate deficiency, but dif- ferent laboratories use different upper limits. Greater than 14 \u00b5mol/L is perhaps the most commonly used value. Elevated plasma homocysteine is also seen in vitamin B 12 deficiency. Vitamin B6 status, age, gender, and renal insufficiency also affect plasma homocysteine levels. Urinary folate is not a sensitive index of folate status. Folate Requirements in PN In the early years of PN, a number of patients died with an acute megaloblastic crisis occurring within a few weeks of starting the therapy. 6 Wardrop et al7 suggested the mechanism could be alcohol toxicity. At that time, parenteral fat was not available, so all needed calories were given as dextrose, with its attendant hyperglycemic problems, or as a dextrose-alcohol mixture. The toxic effect of alcohol on hematopoiesis was well known. 8 Later investigators described this syndrome in PN patients not receiving any alcohol.9 They found, however, an association with high levels of glycine and methionine. Folate supplementation prevented this syndrome. A later speculation pointed to the common practice of using mostly glycine to provide nonessential amino acid nitrogen. Glycine is a highly soluble amino acid. It was suggested that excessive glycine may block the serine-glycine conversion, which provides the l-carbon moieties that convert THF to N 5,10 methylene THF, the active form in purine and pyrimidine synthesis. In those early years, folate was not always added to short-term PN. After supplemental folate was shown to avoid this megaloblastic syndrome, 200 mcg/d was added. This has now been increased to 400 mcg/d of folate monoglutamate to cover patients with longstanding malnutrition and depleted folate stores. Most PN patients have high normal serum folate levels. 1 Age Tables 4-7 in the main section show recommended folate intakes enterally and parenterally in neonates, children, ado-lescents, and adults. The amount is expressed as mcg/kg/d for small infants (<3.0 kg), but thereafter it is a standard pediatric Appendix A8.1. Factors Leading to Folic Acid Deficiency 1.

The parenteral dose is 30% higher than the enteral dose until adulthood, when it is the same, 400 mcg/d. Pregnancy The U.S. 1998 mandate for folate fortification of cereal fol-lowed the publication of several studies showing that pericon-ceptional folate supplementation reduced the risk of a second NTD in mothers who have had this complication by as much as 35%-40%. 10,11 A randomized study in Hungary evaluated the effect of a multivitamin providing 800 mcg/d of folic acid or placebo in 4753 women planning a pregnancy but with no prior history of NTD. 12 The study was prematurely terminated after there were 6 cases of NTD in the controls and none in the group receiving vitamin supplementation. The effect of supplemental folate alone was not assessed. Currently, the evidence for a protective effect of folate supplements or fortified food or both is much stronger than that for natural food folate. Preliminary data indicate a 50% reduction in NTDs since cereal fortifica-tion was required. 1 Current parenteral multivitamin products provide 400 mcg/d. There is no specific pregnancy product. It seems wise to recommend increasing folate acid in the adult formula so as provide for women who become pregnant and are dependent on PN. There are no known adverse consequences of this increased amount in nonpregnant adults. Recommendation for Folic Acid in PN The current dose of 600 mcg/d for adults appears to gener - ously meet requirements even for females who are pregnant or lactating. If the patient has short bowel syndrome and is being weaned off PN, monitoring erythrocyte folate and starting oral supplements are appropriate. Most short bowel patients retain their duodenum and some of their jejunum, and these are the chief sites for folate absorption, and thus oral supplementation can be effective.

Appendix Peggy Borum, PhD Introduction Biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin that as zyme in bicarbonate-dependent carboxylation reactions.1 Metabolic Function Biotin metabolism does not appear to be the same in all tissues of the body. Biotin deficiency in rats results in a decrease of pyruvate carboxylase and of propionyl-CoA carboxylase of about 90% in adipose tissue, jejunum, and spleen but only a 40% decrease in heart, indicating that the effect of biotin deficiency differs among organs. 2 Biotin plays an important role in the metabolism of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids as it func-tions as a coenzyme for 4 carboxylases. It is known that biotin plays a role in immune function, cell proliferation, and fetal development. New evidence suggest that biotin also plays an important role in regulating expression of genes encoding cyto-kines and their receptors, oncogenes, genes involved in glucose metabolism, and genes that play a role in cellular biotin homeo-stasis. Data suggest that biotinyl-AMP functions in the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, biotin deficiency increases nuclear translocation of NF-B, and remodeling biotinylation histones. 3,4 Biotin is covalently attached to specific lysine residues in histones in a reversible process that depends on the exogenous biotin supply. 5 In addition to biotin serving as a coenzyme for pyruvate carboxylase, biotin also influences both the synthesis and degradation of pyruvate carboxylase. 6 In mice, biotin deficiency may upregulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- production, and biotin excess may downregulate TNF- production, leading to the suggestion that biotin status influences inflammatory diseases. 7 by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 485 Reliable Assessment Methods of Deficiency and Toxicity Biotin deficiency has been documented in individuals con- suming raw egg whites over long periods and in patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) that does not contain bio-tin. There is not a good laboratory test for detecting biotin deficiency, so the condition is usually identified by its symp-toms. Biotin deficiency may result in dermatitis (red scaly rash around eyes, nose, and mouth), conjunctivitis, alopecia, and central nervous system abnormalities such as depression, leth-argy, hallucinations, and paresthesia of the extremities. Biotin deficiency in infants may result in hypotonia, lethargy, devel-opmental delays, and withdrawn behavior. 1 Requirement in PN A Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) has not been set due to insufficient available scientific evidence. Daily Adequate Intake (AI) of biotin levels has been established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute of Medicine based on extrapolation from the amount of biotin in human milk. People with a genetic biotinidase deficiency and people on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment may have an increased requirement for biotin. No adverse effects of excess biotin have been reported in humans or animals. No toxicity has been observed in patients receiving up to 200 mg orally and up to 20 mg parenterally to treat biotin-responsive inborn errors of metabolism and acquired biotin deficiency. Due to insufficient data on adverse effects, the upper tolerable intake limit (UL) could not be deter - mined. 1 PN biotin recommendations are derived from the deliberations of expert panels.8,9 Biotin is stable in a 3-L plastic bag while stored in darkness at 2-8\u00b0C for 96 hours or during 24 hours of simulated infusion initiated immediately after mixing. 10 There have been several reports of biotin deficiency in patients on PN with varying prevalence rates. In 49 patients receiving home PN, 3 had symptoms of biotin deficiency, including dry eyes and angular cheilitis or hair loss. 11 In another study, patients on biotin-free PN for 1 month had clinical symptoms consistent with biotin deficiency, reduced plasma biotin concentrations, and decreased propionyl CoA carboxylase activity. After 4 months of biotin-supplemented PN, both plasma biotin concentrations and pro-pionyl CoA carboxylase activity increased to near-normal levels. 12 Almost half of 13 children on home PN for 1.5 months to 7 year and 17 hospitalized infants and children receiving PN had initially low levels of plasma biotin. Biotin rose sharply during the first month of supplementation with 60 mcg/d of par - enteral biotin but returned to the normal range. 13 However, in another study of 102 children receiving all or part of their nutri-tion needs from home PN, only 1 case of biotin deficiency was recognized. 14 Plasma biotin concentrations of term infants and children on biotin-supplemented PN were maintained at refer - ence levels, but the biotin levels of preterm infants increased significantly to more than 2 standard deviations above refer - ence levels.15 When adult patients on long-term PN have plasma biotin concentrations above the normal range, the patients usu-ally have some form of renal dysfunction. 16 After studying 3 patients with clinical symptoms of biotin deficiency on biotin-free PN and using large doses of biotin therapy (100 \u00b5g/d in all patients; an initial larger dose of 1 mg/d for 1 week plus 10 mg/d for 7 weeks in 1 patient), some investigators \"speculate that the biotin supplement currently recommended for pediatric patients (20 micrograms/day) may not be adequate therapy for biotin deficiency and might not even be adequate to maintain normal biotin status during TPN [total parenteral nutrition].\" 17 Modifications Due to Gender, Age, Pregnancy, and Lactation Individuals eating an oral diet may be at greater risk for biotin deficiency than previously recognized. Women who smoke appear to have accelerated biotin metabolism, which results in marginal biotin deficiency. 18 In a recent study, 18 of 22 preg- nant women had laboratory characteristics of marginal biotin deficiency that responded to biotin supplementation. 19 Biotin status of pregnant women affects the developing fetus. Culture of human embryonic palatal mesenchymal (HEPM) cells in the biotin-deficient and biotin-physiological (control) media for 5 weeks showed a decrease in biotin after 1 week and decreased proliferation of HEPM cells in the biotin-deficient state after 2 weeks of culture (41.3% of the control). Nuclei of biotin-deficient cells also had decreased numbers of biotinyl-ated histones compared with control cells. Suppressed prolif-eration of mesenchymal cells \"may delay or inhibit the growth of palatal processes in embryos and thus it may partially con-tribute to the mechanisms for cleft palate induction.\" 20 Recommendations Biotin Population Recommendation Reference Oral nutrition: adults AI = 30 mcg/d 1 Oral nutrition: pregnant females AI = 30 mcg/d 1 Oral nutrition: breastfeeding femalesAI = 35 mcg/d 1 AI = 5 mcg/d 1Oral AI = 6 AI = 8 AI = 12 AI = 20 children, 14-18 y AI = 25 mcg/d 1PN: adults 60 mcg/d 8 PN: term infants and children 20 mcg/d 9 PN: preterm infants and children 8 mcg/kg/d Adequate Intake; PN, parenteral nutrition. by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from 486 Nutrition in Clinical Practice 27(4) Appendix 9 References 1.

J Parenteral Nutrition Marty RPh, BCNSP Introduction Molybdenum functions as a cofactor for a limited number of enzymes in humans. The Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board has developed Adequate Intakes (AIs) for infants (2-3 mcg/d) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for children and adults (17-50 mcg/d) (Table A10.1). The average dietary intake of molybdenum by adult men and women is 109 and 76 mcg/d, respectively. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) is 2 mg/d based on impaired reproduction and growth in animals. 1 In the United States, parenteral molybdenum is available as a single-entity trace element injection (Table 11 in the main paper). The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) includes molybdenum as a substrate in its \"Trace Elements Injection\" monograph, 3 but no such multiple trace element injection product containing molybdenum is available in the United States. Metabolic Function Molybdenum has been shown to act as a cofactor for a limited enzymes are involved in the catabo-lism of sulfur amino acids and heterocyclic compounds, including purines and pyridines. A clear molybdenum defi-ciency syndrome has not been achieved in animals, despite major reduction in the activity of these enzymes. Rather, molybdenum deficiency is based on a genetic defect that pre-vents sulfite oxidase synthesis. 1 Reliable Assessment Methods Plasma and serum molybdenum concentrations are very low in humans and are difficult to measure. As a consequence, there are few reports on plasma or serum molybdenum con-centrations. Plasma concentrations do not reflect molybde-num status and cannot be used as an indicator of estimating requirements. 1 by Karrie Derenski on April 1, 2013 ncp.sagepub.com Downloaded from A.S.P.E.N. Position Paper / Vanek et al 487 The primary route of molybdenum excretion is the urine. Urinary molybdenum reflects dietary intake, increasing as dietary intake increases. Although related to dietary intake, uri-nary molybdenum alone does not reflect status. Several biochemical changes have been observed in special situations. In molybdenum cofactor deficiency, urinary sulfate was low and urinary acid con-centrations xanthine and hypoxanthine increased, and plasma methionine was increased. However, these observations have not been associated with molybdenum intakes in normal, healthy people and cannot be used as indica-tors for estimating molybdenum requirements. Requirements in Parenteral Nutrition The published, estimated daily molybdenum parenteral nutri-tion (PN) requirements from various professional groups are listed in Table A10.2. Most professional groups indicate the need for molybdenum in long-term (eg, home PN) patients. Abumrad et al 9 in 1981 reported a case of a 24-year-old man suffering from intolerance to amino acids, mainly l-methi-onine, while on prolonged PN (18 months). The patient dis-played tachycardia, tachypnea, central scotomas, night blindness, and irritability, leading to coma. The symptoms dis-appeared with discontinuation of the administered l-amino acid solutions. Biochemical abnormalities included high plasma methionine and low serum uric acid levels associated acid. Treatment with ammonium molybdate (300 mcg/d) improved the clinical condition, reversed the sulfur handling defect, and normalized uric acid production. This is the only Table A10.1.

The National Academy of Sciences/Institute of Medicine1 notes that molybdenum deficiency has not been observed in healthy people, and the only case that might be considered a dietary deficiency is that of Abumrad et al. While there are no reports of molybdenum deficiency in infants, low birth weight (LBW) infants might be at risk because they are born before adequate stores can be acquired, have rapid growth requiring increased intakes, and frequently receive PN. Friel and coworkers 10 performed a molybdenum balance study in 16 LBW infants on PN. They speculate that an intravenous intake of 1 mcg/kg/d would be adequate for the LBW infant. The amount of molybdenum provided daily as part of the background contamination of current PN formulations in the U.S. is uncertain. In Sweden (1977), the amount of assayed molybdenum provided in a PN balance study was a mean of 9.9 mcg/d (range, 8.6-11 mcg/d). 11 In Australia (1981), the amount of assayed molybdenum in PN products (used to compound PN formulations) ranged from <5 to 15 mcg/L. The total amount of molybdenum infused daily was 10 mcg/d or less. 12 In the U.S. (1989), the amount of daily molybdenum in a model PN formu-lation was calculated (from individual assays of PN products) to be 244 mcg/d. 2 No more recent publications of PN molybde- num contamination amounts are available. Recommendations for Molybdenum in PN 1. Only 1 case of molybdenum deficiency in PN (none in the diet) has been reported. 2. The amount of molybdenum provided as a contami - nant in current U.S. PN products is uncertain. 3. The commercial U.S. availability of a single-entity molybdenum injection should be retained. 4. Plasma and urine molybdenum levels do not indicate nutrient status or requirements. 5. Practitioners should be alert for a constellation of signs and biochemical abnormalities described in the Abumrad et al9 case as potential indicators for molybdenum PN supplementation. 6. Further research is needed to assess the level of molybdenum contamination of U.S. PN products. Appendix 10 References 1.
