The aim of this study was to assess thesafety and immunogenicity of a nicotine conjugate vaccine, NicVAX, and its effects on smoking behavior.Smokers (N /H1154968) were recruited for a noncessation treatment study and assigned to 1 of 3 doses of the nicotine vaccine (50, 100, or 200 /H9262g) or placebo. They were injected on days 0, 28, 56, and 182 and monitored for a period of 38 weeks. Results showed that the nicotine vaccine was safe and well tolerated.Vaccine immunogenicity was dose-related ( P<.001), with the highest dose eliciting antibody concentrations within the anticipated range of efficacy. There was no evidence of compensatory smoking or precipitation ofnicotine withdrawal with the nicotine vaccine. The 30-day abstinence rate was significantly different acrossthe 4 doses ( P/H11549.02), with the highest rate of abstinence occurring with 200 /H9262g. The nicotine vaccine appears to be a promising medication for tobacco dependence. (Clin Pharmacol Ther 2005;78:456-67.) Dorothy PhD,Michael Fiore, Joseph Koopmeiners, Arjen de Vos, MD, PhD,Gary Horwith, MD, and Paul R. Pentel, MD Minneapolis, Minn, Omaha, Neb, Madison, Wis, and Rockville, Md Surveys show that, although about 41% of smokers make a quit attempt each year, less than 5% of smokersare successful at remaining abstinent for 3 months to ayear. 1Smokers seeking available behavioral and phar- macologic therapies can enhance successful quit ratesby 2- to 3-fold over control conditions. 2However, the rates of abstinence remain relatively low. In clinicaltrials the long-term rate of abstinence by use of phar-macologic treatments, with or without behavioral ther-apy, is about 25% on average. 2Moreover, these per- centages most likely exaggerate the efcacy ofintervention because these trials are typically composedof subjects who are highly motivated to quit and whoare free of complicating diagnoses such as depressionor other psychiatric disorders. 3Because the vast major- ity of those who attempt to quit will not achieve pro-longed abstinence, the need for better approaches tosmoking cessation is evident. The potential usefulness of vaccination as an inter- vention for drug abuse was rst demonstrated in ananimal model by Bonese et al 4for heroin and was subsequently extended in animal models to phencycli-dine, cocaine, methamphetamine (INN, metamfet-amine), and nicotine (see reference 5). V accination elicits the production of drug-specic antibodies thatbind drug and reduce its distribution to the brain.Preclinical studies of short- and long-term adminis-tration of clinically relevant doses of nicotine showthat nicotine vaccines reduce the distribution of nic-otine to the brain in rats by up to 65%. 6Vaccination of rats or passive immunization with nicotine-specic immunoglobulin G (IgG) has also beenshown to reduce nicotine discrimination, the devel-From the University of Minnesota Medical School, Cancer Center, Tobacco Use Research Center, and Minneapolis Medical ResearchFoundation, Minneapolis; University of Nebraska Medical School,Omaha; University of Wisconsin Medical School, Center for To-bacco Research and Intervention, Madison; and Nabi Biopharma-ceuticals, Rockville.

The general concept of vaccination as a means of blocking nicotine's effects is attractive because of itsspecicity. The antibody itself does not appreciablyenter the brain so that central nervous system sideeffects are not expected. The antibodies elicited byvaccination are highly specic for nicotine and do notbind endogenous Thus a vaccine against nicotine should not beassociated with many of the adverse effects inherent toother pharmacologic treatments for drug abuse. Vacci-nation for nicotine dependence would then represent aunique addition to the available strategies for treatingnicotine dependence. The primary aims of this study were to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational con-jugate nicotine vaccine. Several concerns, such as thepotential for compensatory smoking to overcome thereduction in the reinforcing effects from smoking as aresult of the binding of nicotine to antibody, as well asa precipitation of withdrawal symptoms after vaccina-tion, have been raised regarding immunotherapy forsmoking cessation. 12Therefore secondary objectives of the study were to assess withdrawal symptoms, the occurrence of compensatory smoking behavior, andchange in tobacco use. Multiple administrations of 50,100, or 200 /H9262g of a nicotine conjugate vaccine were delivered to current smokers in a study in which neitherdesire to quit nor willingness to make a quit attemptwas required. METHODS Subjects A total enrollment of 63 subjects was planned, and 68 subjects (15 women and 53 men) were enrolled from3 research sites: University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,Minn (n /H1100524); University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis (n/H1100521); and University of Nebraska, Omaha, Neb (n /H1100523). The 5 additional subjects replaced subjects who withdrew from the study within 1 month after the rstinjection. All withdrawn subjects did so for non-safety-related reasons. Each site recruited subjects throughadvertisements in newspapers or on the radio or tele-vision. Interested participants were asked to call theresearch clinic, the study was explained, and an initialscreening was undertaken. If subjects met the initial screening criteria, they were scheduled for an appoint-ment to obtain informed consent and to undergo acomprehensive screening of their physical health. Ma-jor inclusion criteria for the study included the follow-ing: (1) male subjects or female subjects who were notof child-bearing potential and were aged at least 18years, (2) subjects currently smoking at least 15 ciga-rettes per day (with alveolar carbon monoxide level of /H1102210 ppm), (3) a history of smoking for at least the past 6 months without a period of abstinence for greater than7 days and no intention to quit for the next 30 days, (4)good general health (ie, without signicant medicalhistory, clinically /H1102175% forced expiratory vital capacity /H1102180% of the pre- dicted mean value for height, age, race, and gender),and (5) good mental health (ie, no history of alcohol ordrug abuse or psychiatric history within the past 3months). Major exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)any prior exposure to a nicotine vaccine or exposure toany other vaccine, except for influenza, 30 days beforeadministration of study product; (2) allergy to alum orany components of the vaccine; (3) use of inhaledcorticosteroids, systemic steroids, antihistamines, orimmunosuppressive agents within 30 days before thestudy; and (4) use of any smoking cessation techniquewithin 30 days of the screening visit. The study wasconducted under an Investigational New Drug applica-tion to the US Food and Drug Administration. Theinstitutional review boards at the study sites approvedthe study protocol and informed consent forms.Table I.

Within each treatment group, 21subjects were randomized in a ratio of 2:1 (vaccine/placebo), yielding a total of 14 vaccine and 7 placebosubjects per treatment group. For each subject, therewas a 10-day screening period followed by randomiza-tion and active participation for 38 weeks (9 months)from day 0 ( Table I ). Generally, the clinic visits oc- curred weekly for the rst 12 weeks and then approx-imately monthly for the next 26 weeks. Injections were scheduled to be administered at days 0, 28, 56, and 182. A physician or study nurse admin-istered all investigational products. After the injections,each subject remained at the study site for a minimumof 30 minutes for recording of postinjection vital signsand for observation. Subjects returned to the clinic forfollow-up evaluation on the next day after each injec-tion. The data and safety monitoring board reviewed allavailable postinjection subject data before each subse-quent administration. No instructions were given to the subjects regarding their smoking behavior. If they inquired about theirsmoking, they were informed to smoke as they felt comfortable. No behavioral counseling for cessationwas provided unless the participant indicated that theywould like to quit smoking. If a study participant ex-pressed a desire to quit, a standardized treatment pro-tocol was implemented, in which subjects receivedbrief treatment intervention and a treatment manual.Otherwise, the sessions were focused primarily on as-sessment of safety and tobacco use behaviors. Study outcome measures Safety. Safety was assessed through physical exami- nations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiography, and lab-oratory studies including hematologic testing, chemicaltesting, and urinalysis, as well as through monitoring of\"reactogenicity\" and adverse events. Reactogenicityevents included local reactions (eg, erythema, induration,tenderness, ache, burning, and heat) and systemic com-plaints (malaise, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, fever, andheadache) that occurred within the rst 7 days after injec-tion. By use of an electronic diary, the presence andseverity of these 12 potential events were assessed andrecorded daily by subjects (rated as not present, mild,moderate, or severe). Adverse events were monitored ateach clinic visit by querying the subjects about any healthproblems that they may have had since the last visit.Withdrawal symptoms were assessed weekly, or daily for Fig 1.

Blood specimens were collected during the study ( Fig 1 ) for determination of antinico- tine antibody levels measured by polyglu- tamic and blocked dry milk inphosphate-buffered saline solution. Human sera, refer-ence standards, and controls were applied to the plate in2-fold dilutions and incubated for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C.After a wash step, the plates were incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-labeled goat antihuman IgG for 30minutes at 37\u00b0C. After a nal wash step, the color wasdeveloped by addition of peroxidase substrate. Plateswere read at A 450. The amount of nicotine-specic IgG was quantitated in samples by comparison with the standard curve. The nicotine human IgG ELISA detectsall IgG subtypes. Because no national or international reference stan- dards exist for nicotine antibodies, reference standardswere developed by Nabi Biopharmaceuticals (Rock-ville, Md) and prepared from pools of serum fromhuman volunteers who had been vaccinated withNicVAX. Nicotine-specic IgG antibody was quanti-tated by an ELISA in which antibody bound tonicotine-coated plates was quantitated against antibodybound by anti-Fab-coated plates. Assessment of smoking behavior and effects A tobacco use history form was completed during the screening to obtain information on characteristics of thesubject's tobacco use behavior and to assess depen-dence by use of the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine De-pendence. 14A daily electronic diary, consisting of a set of questions inquiring about cigarette and other tobacco use, was completed by subjects to assess changes insmoking behaviors, including compensatory smoking.Biochemical measures of smoke intake were obtained byassessing urinary cotinine (NNK) and are highly correlated withcotinine. Total NNAL was measured because cotinineconcentrations in serum may be altered by vaccinationand may not be an accurate measure of nicotine intake invaccinated subjects. 15The rst morning urine voids were collected, processed, and quantied for NNAL and NNAL-Gluc as described previously.16,17Measurements for total NNAL were obtained at each injection time andat the end of the study. Spot urine samples were collected and quantied for cotinine and its glucuronides (totalcotinine) as described previously. 16Measurements for to - tal cotinine were obtained before injection, at each injec-tion time, weekly for 3 weeks after the injection, and at theend of the study. The quantication was conducted at theUniversity of Minnesota. Alveolar CO was measured byuse of the Micro Smokerlyzer (Bedfont, Medford, NJ) andwas obtained at each clinic visit. Product descriptions The investigational product, AMNic-rEPA (NicVAX), consists of the /H9262g rEPA ad- sorbed to mg Alhydrogel 85, in 1 mLphosphate-buffered saline solution (0.15-mol/L sodiumchloride; 0.002-mol/L sodium phosphate, pH 7.2; 80). Placebo contained phosphate-bufferedsaline solution with 0.8 mg Alhydrogel 85 (E.M. SergeantPulp and Chemical Co, Inc, Clifton, NJ). To maintainblinding, each subject received 2 injections of 1 mL oneach injection day (1 injection in each deltoid muscle). Statistical analyses Data were analyzed primarily by the Biostatistics Core of the University of Minnesota TransdisciplinaryTobacco Use Research Center and by Nabi Biophar-maceuticals. Subject data were analyzed up to the pointof discharge from the study or up to the point ofdropping out of the study. Primary and secondary out-comes were compared across doses and antibody con-centration levels. Antibody concentration levels weredetermined by the quartile of each subject's maximumantibody concentration. Baseline characteristics werecompared by doses and antibody concentration levelsby use of 1-way ANOVA or Fisher exact test as ap-propriate. Subsequent analyses were adjusted for base-line differences signicant at the P/H11349.05 level unless otherwise indicated. Antibody concentration was compared by dose by use of the maximum antibody concentration achievedfor each subject. The geometric mean maximum anti-body concentration was compared by dose levels by useof a general linear model to adjust for baseline differ-ences. Geometric mean antibody concentrations werecompared for the total study population over time byuse of a general linear mixed model to account for thecorrelation among repeated measurements within sub-jects. 18CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS 2005;78(5):456-67 Nicotine vaccine 459Nicotine withdrawal (sum score of the withdrawal symptoms minus the craving item) and craving andcompensatory smoking (as determined by change innumber of cigarettes per day, CO levels, and totalcotinine concentration) data were also compared at28-day intervals after the second, third, and fourthinjections. Because of the limited collection times forthe assessment of total NNAL concentrations, the sam-ples from the interval from the second injection to theend of the study were compared. At each interval, themean and maximum values were determined for eachsubject and the difference from baseline was calculated(mean minus baseline, maximum minus baseline). Formost measures (ie, withdrawal symptoms, craving, cig-arette intake), baseline was calculated as the 4 weeksafter the rst injection, except for CO and cotinine, forwhich we had preinjection baseline data. The 4 weeksafter the rst injection was chosen to reflect baselinelevels because of the minimal increase in antibodyconcentrations observed during this time. These differ-ences were compared by doses and antibody concen-tration levels by use of a general linear model to adjustfor signicant baseline covariates. Abstinence rates were compared by vaccine doses and antibody concentration levels by use of the Fisherexact test. Time to rst 30-day quit attempt was sum-marized by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by useof the log-rank test. Censored observations representsubjects who did not achieve 30 days of consecutiveabstinence before the end of the study or who were lostto follow-up. These analyses were not adjusted forbaseline differences because of the small number ofevents.RESULTS Subjects A total of 130 subjects were screened for the study. Of these participants, 62 did not meet screening criteriaand 68 were admitted to the study. Of the 68 subjectswho constituted the analysis sample, 61 received thesecond injection, 60 received the third, and 56 receivedthe fourth. The reasons for study withdrawal were asfollows: 6 withdrew consent (3 for work-related rea-sons and 3 for personal reasons), 1 was noncompliantwith the protocol, 3 were lost to follow-up, and 2 hadmedical problems develop unrelated to the study drug.For those subjects who terminated early, the meannumber of days ( /H11006SD) that they were in the study was 82.2/H1100671.7 (range, 6.0-198.0 days). A summary of the demographics and smoking histories of the study participants is given in Table II . There were signicant differences among dosegroups for gender ( P/H11005.04) and number of cigarettes smoked ( P/H11005.05). These variables were controlled for in subsequent analyses. There was a signicantdifference in age among subjects when stratied byquartile of antibody response ( P/H11005.004), and there- fore analyses by antibody concentrations were ad-justed by age.

The majority (89%) of these events was mild,with general discomfort or malaise, headache, and myal-gia being the most commonly reported events. There wereno signicant differences in frequency of systemic reac-togenicity events between placebo and each of the dosegroups. All local and systemic reactogenicity events re-solved within days without medical intervention. Themean number of days for local reactogenicity eventsacross doses ranged from 1.3 to 1.8 days (95% condenceinterval, 1.2-2.1 days), and the mean number of days forsystemic reactogenicity events ranged from 1.5 to 2.8 days(95% condence interval, 1.3-3.8 days). The adverse events occurring in more than 10% of the subjects within each of the treatment groups aredetailed in Table V . A total of 345 adverse events were reported by 64 of 68 subjects. The vast majority(92.5%) of these events were mild or moderate inseverity. In 7% of nicotine vaccine recipients, these adverse events were considered to be related to studydrug, versus 5% in placebo recipients. The most fre-quently reported events were upper respiratory tractinfection, headache, cough, and nasopharyngitis. Nodifferences were observed in the frequency of theseadverse events among the 4 treatment groups. Twoserious adverse events were reported, neither of whichwas related to study drug. One subject (in the 50- /H9262g group) underwent a hysterectomy because of post-menopausal menorrhagia and withdrew from the study.The other subject (in the 100- /H9262g group) was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of complaints of chestpain and for subsequent coronary artery stent place-ment.

Analysis showed no signicant differences in meanmaximum or mean change in withdrawal or cravingafter the second, third, and fourth injections comparedwith the preinjection baseline values when subjectswere stratied by dose or by quartiles of antibodyconcentrations ( P/H11005.19-.89). When subjects were di- vided into quitters (abstinent for 30 days with CO /H113498 ppm) and nonquitters (not abstinent for 30 days at anytime during the study), the changes from baseline inmean withdrawal scores and craving for nonquitterswere not signicantly different across the 4 dose levels(P/H11005.30 and P/H11005.89, respectively) (see Fig 2 , top row). For the quitters, there was a signicant decreasein mean craving observed during the rst 2 weeks ofabstinence compared with baseline ( P/H11005.004), but thedecrease in withdrawal symptoms was not signicant (P/H11005.10). Comparisons across dose levels for quitters were not completed because of the small number ofquitters. Immunogenicity Fig 1 shows the geometric mean antinicotine anti- body concentrations over time.

For nonquitters, the mean changes from baseline for these variables were not signicantlydifferent across the 4 dose levels ( P/H11005.32-.96) ( Fig 2). Among quitters, served for total but not for total NNAL ( P/H11005.11), possibly as a result of NNAL's long half-life relative to the duration of abstinence atthe time of assessment. Effects on quitting behavior There was a signicant dose effect for the number of subjects who achieved 30-day biochemically conrmed(CO/H113498 ppm) abstinence (6, 1, 0, and 2 subjects in the 200, 100, and 50 /H9262g vaccine and placebo groups, respectively; P/H11005.02). Analysis of abstinence by quar- tile of antibody concentrations showed a trend in thesame direction ( P/H11005.08). There was also a signicant dose effect in time to achieve 30-day abstinence ( P/H11005 .01) ( Fig 4 ), with the shortest interval occurring for the group receiving 200 /H9262g vaccine. DISCUSSION The results from this study show that multiple vac- cine doses of 50 to 200 /H9262g AMNic-rEPA per dose are safe and well tolerated in healthy smokers. The com-parable frequency of reactogenicity events in the pla-cebo and vaccine groups suggests that these eventswere a result of the administration of either buffer oradjuvant and not the active vaccine components. Pub-lished 19or preliminary20data for 2 other nicotine vac - cines and published data for a cocaine vaccine21have shown similar safety proles. There was no evidence of precipitation of withdrawal symptoms in the total sam-ple, in nonquitters, or in quitters. It is likely that the development of antibody concentrations occurs at asufciently slow rate that withdrawal symptoms are notevoked. Furthermore, vaccination of rats against nico-tine prolongs the half-life of nicotine by 3- to 6-fold, 22 resulting in a more gradual decrease in nicotine con-centrations. If this alteration in half-life also occurs inhumans, the slower decline in nicotine levels couldminimize the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms. A clear dose-response relationship was observed be- tween the dose of nicotine vaccine and the mean anti-body concentrations in serum, although the range ofserum antibody concentrations was wide. In the studyconducted with the cocaine vaccine, antibody levelsvaried by 31.9-fold at the 56-day assessment point, 21 which is similar to the considerable range observed forthe nicotine vaccine. As expected, the nicotine-specicantibody concentration in serum was low after the rstvaccine dose but increased with the second and thirddoses and responded to a booster dose at 6 months.Antibody levels declined between injections, eventhough most subjects continued to smoke, because nic-otine itself is not a complete immunogen. The rate ofantibody decline could not be accurately determined inthis study because too few antibody levels were mea-sured between any 2 doses, but the data suggest thatrepeated booster doses may be needed to maintainmaximal antibody levels for more than a few monthsand that any effects of immunization would not bepermanent. These results are generally similar to thosereported in a phase I study of a nicotine vaccine usinga similar hapten (nicotine with a a viruslike particle. 19In nonsmok - ers, antibody titers increased after each of 2 vaccinedoses and antibody titers declined after the secondinjection, with an estimated half-life of 57 days. As inour study, the range of antibody titers achieved waswide, indicating considerable interindividual variabilityin the antibody titer response. The efcacy of vaccination in rats, as measured by its ability to reduce nicotine distribution to the brain, isclosely related to the serum antibody concentration. 22 The best responders in our study, primarily in the groupreceiving 200 /H9262g vaccine, had antibody levels compa- rable to those that have been associated with substantialchanges in nicotine distribution in rats ( /H1102230/H9262g/mL). 23 Thus our study is encouraging with regard to vaccine immunogenicity, but strategies to increase and to sus-tain this response may be helpful in maximizing theability of this vaccine to attenuate nicotine's effects inhumans.

Cotinine concentrations also didnot show compensation but should be interpreted cau-tiously because this vaccine decreases nicotine clear-ance in rats and, presumably, the rate of cotinine for-mation as well. Changes in cotinine levels may reflectaltered nicotine metabolism rather than intake. 22Sig- nicant differences across antibody concentration quar-tiles for number of cigarettes per day and CO level maybe spurious because no clear dose-response pattern wasobserved. The results did not, however, show evidenceof increased exposure but rather showed a decrease inexposure that was greatest in those participants with thesecond-quartile antibody concentration. Smoking be-havior was not reported in the only other publishedstudy of a nicotine vaccine. 19 Although cessation efcacy was not a primary end- point for this study, a signicantly greater 30-day ab-stinence rate was observed in the group receiving the200-/H9262g vaccine dose compared with all other groups. The fact that this higher abstinence rate was seen onlyin the highest-dose vaccine group suggests a relation- ship between efcacy and antibody concentration and isconsistent with animal data showing a close correlationbetween nicotine-specic antibody concentrations elic-ited by vaccination and magnitude of effects. It ispossible that vaccination doses or schedules elicitingeven higher antibody concentrations would be stillmore effective. However, caution is needed in inter-preting this result because efcacy was not the primaryoutcome for this study, the number of subjects wassmall, and the results may not be predictive of efcacyobserved in a large clinical trial. In summary, the results from this preliminary inves- tigation showed that the conjugate nicotine vaccinestudied is safe and well tolerated. Vaccine immunoge-nicity was dose-related, with the highest dose elicitingserum antibody concentrations within the anticipatedtarget range for efcacy. The large individual variabil-ity in immunogenicity could present a challenge to theclinical use of the vaccine, and further efforts to max-imize immunogenicity may facilitate further clinicaltesting of this strategy for treating tobacco addiction.Future clinical trials should also consider the effects ofgender on treatment efcacy because of evidence show-ing potential differences in sensitivity to nicotine'seffects. 24-26 Fig 4.
