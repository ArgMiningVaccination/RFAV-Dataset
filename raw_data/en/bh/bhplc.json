I cringe. Yet, I am a certified Spiritual Healer. It is a hard thing to reconcile. That is why I prefer to refer to myself as a Spiritual Healing Facilitator. It is our responsibility to heal ourselves; no one can do that for us without playing our part. Anyone in the spiritual realm who tells you they can heal you is more likely a fraud than anything else. At the very least, they are led by ego instead of spirit. Before we talk about what a Spiritual Healer is, we must first understand what spiritual healing is and why it is important. What is spiritual healing? Spiritual Healing can look differently for everyone, but the very short version is that spiritual healing is a process of removing the energetic blocks that prevent us from... well, healing. That could be physical, emotional, or mental healing. There is no one-size-fits-all in spiritual healing. That is why many spiritual healers utilize multiple modalities such as Reiki, Crystals, Sound, Massage, Coaching, Meditation, Yoga, Aromatherapy, Herbalism, and Mindfulness. Because each of us is an individual spiritual being with different blocks, it is important to have an individualized plan for healing. Possibly the most important thing to understand about spiritual healing is that no one can do it for us. This is one reason the term Spiritual Healer can be confusing because the reality is that you are healing yourself, and no one is doing it for you. If you are not open to the healing or willing to be open to changing certain thoughts or behaviors, the healing may not work. By experiencing energetic healing, we create a state in our beings to be more open to physical, emotional, and mental wellbeing. It can enhance prescribed medical or psychological treatments such as medications and therapy. Spiritual healing is a complementary form of healing. Along with Western treatments, healing can be enhanced or sped up. Spiritual healing is a holistic approach to well-being. Spiritual healing for physical pain Yes, it is possible for physical illness and pain to manifest due to energetic imbalances. I often say, maybe the most important thing to understand when it comes to healing, is that, unresolved trauma and emotions must be processed to be healed. Yes, it sucks, and we like to believe that if we just stuff things down, they will go away. The truth is, unresolved trauma and emotions will always rise to the surface at some point, in some way. I didn't just learn this in my training. I learned it the hard way, and not just once. As a survivor of prolonged childhood trauma, much of my life has been spent stuffing down unresolved emotions. But let me give you another example. In 2020, just before COVID, my Dad died. I went back to my job of 10 years (after I had quit) and went on with my life. In September of the same year, I made an emergency trip to my doctor because I thought I must have Pancreatitis. That is what Google said was wrong with me based on my severe pain and symptoms. My doctor tried to get me to the emergency room, but I was too scared to go. With COVID and watching my Dad die in the hospital a few months before, I could not bring myself to do it. I begged him just to figure out what was wrong with me. While he agreed and ordered a rush CT scan, he made me promise to rush to the hospital if it got even a little worse. The good news, I did not have pancreatitis. But no one knew what was wrong with me. I only knew I could not eat anything without it making me sick and causing severe pain in my upper abdomen. And worse for someone who is carrying extra weight and whose Dad just had died from heart problems, I was having severe chest pain and heart racing. Three months later and after a multitude of tests, no one could find anything, so they slapped the generic label on it of stress-related IBS. I tried every diet possible, eliminating, adding, and living on juice for a few weeks. It didn't matter. As soon as something hit my stomach, my heart would start racing, and I would be sick to my stomach. The medications didn't help, the diet change didn't help, something was wrong. My anxiety, which I self-managed for almost 40 years, was now unbearable. I had to accept that I needed anxiety medication to survive. It helped a little, but I was still lying in bed at night with chest pains, knowing that I wasn't going to survive the night. Though logically, I knew my heart was okay, it did not matter. I had my doctor send me to a cardiologist, knowing they would not find anything, but assuming if I had all the cardiac tests and they came back fine, my nightly fear of dying would go away. So I went to the cardiologist; I had all the tests, which came back fine. It eased the chest pains a little bit to a bearable level. Until they came back. I started analyzing my life. I knew that whatever was wrong with me was \"in my head\". Though I spent nights in bed researching heart problems, different types of cancer, and all the rare diseases I was surely dying from, my soul knew it wasn't physical. So I came to the assumption that losing my Dad messed with my head more than I thought. Part of me thought it didn't make sense. I lost my Mom 15 years prior, and it did not have this type of impact on my physical being, and she was my life. On top of that, I went through the grief process with my Dad, I never did with my Mom. I knew the pain from losing my Dad was not some unresolved thing. What I had not considered, however, was the stress and resentment that had been building inside of me due to my job and my career of nearly two decades. I was giving my all, working what felt like all of my time and energy. My business was a 24/7 business and usually quite thankless. Not only that, but I knew for a long time what I was doing was not fulfilling. I have always known I was put here to help people and making sure the sale and purchase of people's homes were not that. I became resentful of other people making money off of my back while I buried myself. And to be clear, I did it to myself because I gave all I had to the businesses. It was no one's fault but my own. Still, I was resentful. I felt overworked, underpaid, under-appreciated, and unheard. The breaking point. It came 18 months after I first got sick. I attended a weekend retreat where I allowed myself to disconnect from the outside world and connect with myself. I had an opportunity to receive some energy healing, meditate and practice a form of yoga. My heart wasn't racing, there was no pain in my chest, my heart rate dropped by 8 beats per minute after my first night, and my stomach was fine. On the Tuesday after the retreat, I gave 8 weeks' notice to allow time to find my replacements. During that 8 weeks, I took a step back. I stopped giving every piece of myself and decided I would do everything in my power to ensure my company was in good hands, but anything after that was not my responsibility. I made sure to stick to my spiritual routine of meditation and journaling and all the things that fed my soul. And everything shifted. My point here is that it isn't just long-term trauma that negatively affects us or that needs clearing. Resentment is a powerful thing, and it can wreak havoc not only on our bodies but also on our minds and our spirits. And when we create space within ourselves for healing, healing can occur. Spiritual healing for emotional pain Every one of us has experienced emotional pain at one point or another. The question is, what happens when we leave that emotional pain to fester instead of confronting it. We often hear things like \"push past the pain,\" \"just think positively,\" or \"just get over it already\". Then, when we aren't able to do that, we feel shame that we feel what we feel, and then we can't get over that shame, and then we get stuck in a shame spiral. We wonder why some people are able to overcome something so easily but we can't. It is true that how we respond to a situation and our emotions around that situation are our responsibility. But many of us were never taught how to handle our emotions. Emotions are created by our beliefs which are created by our thoughts. Yet many of us have no idea of the negative beliefs we have created about the world and therefore are unable to see a different perspective. The Research Consider that our thoughts and words are energy; everything is energy, including us. All energy emits a different vibration. For example, love and joy emit the highest vibrations, while hate, fear, and resentment are very low frequency. I know it sounds a bit unbelievable, but several studies have been done to prove this. A [2009 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304395909004564) showed that focusing on pain-related words activates pain regions in the brain, causing more pain. Many of us have seen the stunning images resulting from 20 years of research done by [Dr. Masaru Emoto](https://www.flaska.eu/water-structuring/pioneers-of-water-research/dr-masaru-emoto), which showed us how different crystals form in water depending on words and thoughts. These are just a couple of examples. Now consider how years of negative experiences, thoughts, and emotions affect our mental, physical and emotional well-being. For example, the famous [ACES Study](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(98)00017-8/fulltext) completed in 1986 shows a direct correlation between childhood trauma and increased risk for heart disease, cancer, stroke, obesity, and suicide. Spiritual healing can help to remove those blocks by first bringing them to the light. Once those blocks are removed, we can learn to process things differently. This creates an opportunity to respond to situations differently and to process our emotions around those situations more positively. What a Spiritual Healer is not Now, this is where the confusion and, often, the skepticism come in. A Spiritual Healer does not hold any special powers. They are not miracle workers. There are so-called healers out there who allow people to think that they are some sort of chosen one that the universe anointed as an all-powerful being. That is not the case. A Spiritual Healer is not of a specific religion or spiritual organization. If a Healer tells you that you have to convert to their organized religious organization, run. Spiritual healing is not a religious practice. You can be any religion or no religion at all to receive healing. A Spiritual Healer does not take the place of a medical doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist. Never ever allow someone who claims to be a healer to talk you into stopping your prescribed medications or treatment from a medical or mental health care professional. A Spiritual Healer cannot wave a wand and make all your problems go away. They cannot perform a healing on you, and suddenly your life is perfect. They cannot change your life, only you can do that. However, they can open you up to create space for that change to take place. Ok, Heather, then really, what is a Spiritual Healer? A Spiritual Healer is attuned to energies and acts as a conduit from the Divine. The Divine meaning, the universe, God, spirit, whatever that looks like to you. Again, this is not about religion, it is about energy. Healers work as a part of a team with their healing guides. They bring that divine power through to create a space for healing. It is a gift. Harnessing this gift, Healers are able to locate energetic blocks within our clients and clear those blocks so our clients can begin to heal. Many Healers use their intuition and help from their guides to find the root cause of the problem. The truth is, we all have the ability to heal ourselves. However, if we are stuck in overwhelm, pain or hopelessness, we may need help in opening the channels to receive that healing. Spiritual Healers create an atmosphere of healing. The more appropriate title would be Spiritual Guide, as we are meant to discover what your blocks are, and remove those blocks to create a space of healing.
