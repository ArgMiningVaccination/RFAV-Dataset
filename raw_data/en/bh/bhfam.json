As Yale New Haven Health Chief Clinical Officer Thomas Balcezak explained, the vaccines have been proved to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from [COVID-19](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/coronavirus-facts.html), but the level of protection does start to wane. A [recent CDC analysis](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w) found that after four months, the effectiveness of a booster shot in preventing hospitalizations declined from 91 to 78 percent. \"It's really important, I think, for folks over the age of 50, particularly those who have [comorbid conditions](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2021/covid-underlying-conditions/?s_cid=mm7107e2_w.html) like diabetes or underlying lung disease, to go ahead and seek and get that booster now,\" Balcezak said during a recent press conference streamed on Facebook and Zoom.

Be well rested Studies have shown that sleep matters when it comes to enhancing your response to vaccines. \"Getting sufficient [high-quality sleep](/health/healthy-living/info-2021/sleep-patterns.html) on a regular basis strengthens your body's immune system and optimizes your response to a vaccine,\" American Academy of Sleep Medicine President Kannan Ramar, M.D., said in a statement. A 2020 [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-020-09879-4) in the International Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that the [flu vaccine](/health/conditions-treatments/info-2022/older-adults-high-dose-flu-shot.html) appears to be more effective in people who get adequate sleep for the two nights prior to receiving the shot. Similar results have been found in other studies on vaccines for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, which showed lower antibody responses among individuals who got less sleep. \"Studies have shown that normal sleep after vaccination strengthens the immune response against an invading antigen and this immunity-boosting effect of sleep is clinically significant,\" Khurshid A. Khurshid, M.D., director of the UMMHC/UMMS Center for Neuromodulation at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said in a statement. \"A good night's sleep before and after vaccination "}
