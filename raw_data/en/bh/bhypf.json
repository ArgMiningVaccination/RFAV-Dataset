When to see a medical professional. The diagnostic tools of modern medicine are impressive. Far to often overmedicating can cause further health issues. However, seeing a trained and licensed professional has its place, especially in diagnostics. Remember as medical professionals we are your employees. You have the right to ask as many questions and dictate your healthcare. "}
