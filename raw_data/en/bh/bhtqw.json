A place whose legacy is founded on conscientious adaptation to change - from the unexpected, to the rhythm of the seasons. We believe in growing our community by maintaining and creating new traditions with each generation. We are happy you are here to help us build the next. Farm to table since 1986. The Herbfarm is a five-diamond restaurant tucked inside a quaint cottage in Woodinville wine country. We serve multicourse menus, finalized daily, using ingredients for the food and beverage pairings found on our own farm and throughout the greater Pacific Northwest. Dinner is served Thursday through Sunday, accompanied by conversations with our chefs, seasonal tours of our on premise gardens and live, classical guitar music by Patricio Contreras. Our goal is not to create a meal but an experience, a place for traditions to be made and stories to be told. "}
