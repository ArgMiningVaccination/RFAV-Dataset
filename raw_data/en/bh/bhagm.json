We inhale them, swallow them in contaminated food or water, and absorb them through our skin. Mothers pass them to their babies in utero via the placenta, and then through breast milk. Since the mid 1900's, chemicals have been monitored in fat tissue, breast milk, semen, blood, and urine. Scientists estimate that the average person today has at least 700 contaminants in their body! The majority of these chemicals did not exist prior to the advent of petrochemicals during WWII, and what is perhaps most disturbing about this class of chemicals is that they are stored in our fat tissue for up to 50 years and possibly longer. Effects on the body vary and depend on the amount, timing, duration, and pattern of exposure, as well as the properties of the specific chemical. They can: Directly damage cells or tissues in the body. Attack cells' genetic material, damaging DNA, and setting in motion a sequence of events that can contribute to, and in some cases, cause cancer, birth defects, developmental, or reproductive disorders. Interfere with normal hormone function. This class of chemicals are known to be endocrine disrupters which is just as scary as it sounds, and particularly important when it comes to hormonal health including fertility issues, menstrual challenges, acne, weight gain, depression, and so much more. With over 85,000 synthetic chemicals registered for commercial use in the US and thousands more hitting the market each year, the sheer number of chemicals to which we are exposed makes it difficult to determine direct cause and effect. To make matters worse, the EPA has tested only about 200 of these for safety in humans, and most of those studies were done on one chemical in a large amount. But what about our current experience where we are exposed to hundreds+ of chemicals in small amounts for years? Unfortunately, the only study on that scenario is ongoing and the population being studied is us! I know...the whole thing makes you want to zip yourself into a protective bubble...but don't despair! Although it may seem an overwhelming task, decreasing exposure is surprisingly simple \u2014 and the best place to start. Perhaps you already do a bunch of these. Fantastic. Give yourself a pat on the back for what you already do! Whether you do none of these, or most of these, I bet you can pick a few items below to Clean Up Your Act in 2020, and even have FUN doing it! WHERE TO START - 10 WAYS TO DECREASE TOXIN EXPOSURE TODAY Eat lower on the food chain by consuming less animal products and more plant-based meals. Happy person, happy planet. Avoid pesticide use where possible- buy organic and choose \"green\" lawn and gardening products. When you buy organic, don't forget your wine and your coffee!! Did you know that conventionally grown wine is heavily sprayed with glyphosate (Round Up)?? So that $4.99 bottle of ros\u00e9 at Trader Joe's? Not such a bargain. My current favorite clean wine source is [www.scoutandcellar.com](http://www.scoutandcellar.com). Quit smoking (and vaping). Enough said. Do not microwave in plastic, and better yet, move away from plastic altogether! Check out [www.plastichealthcolaition.org](http://www.plastichealthcolaition.org)for info on reducing plastic in your 'diet'. When using plastic, avoid single-use plastics whenever possible - we love [www.rezip.com](http://www.rezip.com). Wash hands, floors and windowsills frequently. Use doormats at each entrance to the house and consider removing shoes at the doors. Choose \"green\" household cleaners. There are so many great options available these days. My new favorite treat is [www.supernatural.com](http://www.supernatural.com). These are expensive, but part of the higher cost up front is the reuseable glass bottles. Once you purchase those, you just purchase refills of the concentrated cleaners. They work great (money back 'Freaky Clean Guarantee') and smell sooooo good. Choose unbleached paper products, or those bleached without the use of chlorine, including tampons and sanitary pads. Or avoid tampons and use the [www.divacup.com](http://www.divacup.com), or my personal favorite [www.shethinx.com](http://www.shethinx.com). Fill your house with plants! They are the best way to clean up indoor air quality. Shop carefully for personal care products, including skincare, cosmetics, and sunscreen - and choose those that are free of harmful chemicals. Did you know that women use an average of 12 personal care products a day, and men use about six. Teenage girls average 17 products a day. This can mean exposure to hundreds of chemicals just in the course of a morning beauty routine! I get most of these products for myself at [www.beautycounter.com/aimeeshunney](http://www.beautycounter.com/aimeeshunney)(currently loving their Counter Time skincare regimen and mascara), [www.arbonne.com](http://www.arbonne.com)(best lipsticks, lip liners, and blush), and [www.drhauschka.com](http://www.drhauschka.com)(tinted moisturizer is a staple). Other skincare I love is [https://www.osmosisbeauty.com](https://www.osmosisbeauty.com/)and locally in Santa Cruz [https://susanbellskincare.com/](https://susanbellskincare.com/)(love her serums, and also love her - she's my aesthetician).
