When mindfully consumed in ceremony, cacao can work a unique and subtle alchemy of inner and outer transformation. A cacao ceremony is simply gathering together to experience the heart-opening medicine of this plant. There are lots of different ways to hold cacao ceremonies, but ours focus on a shamanic journey. You'll be guided into an introspective and meditative space to help you connect with inner knowing and intuition, support you in processing emotions and healing past wounds, and receive wisdom and creative inspiration. What's included? - Preparation advice - Cleansing ritual - Body relaxation meditation - Guided shamanic journey - Intuitive energy work - Grounding - Sharing circle - Integration support What should I expect? All kinds of feelings and experiences can arise in cacao ceremonies but here are some of the most common ones: - Being gently held to release stuck emotions and physical discomfort - Feeling reset and shifting of patterns that may no longer serve - Spontaneous love for others and yourself - Feelings of bliss and even euphoria - Connection to your intuition and a sense of 'knowing' your next steps - Inner visual imagery arising during the guided journey - A sense of symbolic communication and guidance from the plant teachers, spirit guides, ancestors, the Earth etc. - High creative energy and inspiration for projects - Sometimes your mind may feel busy during the ceremony, but realisations come through in the following days - Sense of expanded consciousness and continued guidance through dreams and synchronicities that lasts after the ceremony - A subtle (or sometimes more dramatic!) change in the trajectory of your life towards more purposeful and heart-driven routes There is no right or wrong experience and we are here to support your processing and integration, as needed and desired. Who's it for? This is an inclusive event, open to all. If you have any accessibility needs or would like a prefer to sit on a chair for the ceremony, please just let us know. What should I bring? The only thing you really need to bring is yourself, but the following optional items can help you gain the most from the experience: - Notebook & pen - Bottle of water - Yoga mat and blanket - Eye pillow or scarf - Your favourite mug - sacred or special object if you have one How should I prepare for the ceremony? If you'd like to go deeper with your journey, we recommend not eating anything heavy or drinking coffee for at least 2 hours before the ceremony. You could also start thinking about an intention for the journey. This is your reason for coming and working with the medicine. There is no right or wrong answer, simply what is relevant for you at the time. If you're unsure what your intention is, don't worry at all - we'll go into this in the ceremony itself. What should I wear? Whatever is seasonally-appropriate and comfortable for you. There are no rules. What do you recommend after the ceremony? A good way of grounding afterwards is to eat a nourishing meal if you feel hungry. Also try to stay hydrated as cacao can have a detoxifying effect on the body. It can be beneficial to have some reflection-time in the days after the ceremony. The experience can bring up memories and emotional turmoil to be processed and integrated, as well as revealing beautiful realisations, inspiration and creativity you may want to capture. We recommend walking in nature, meditation, and journalling, but use whatever tools work for you. Your facilitator can support you in the integration process. Is it safe? Cacao is legal and considered safe, though some people can be a little sensitive to it. It is psychoactive but not psychedelic, and it is more gentle on the nervous system than many of the other master plant teachers. If you are taking anti depressants or SSRI's (MAOI based anti-depressants are contra-indicated with chocolate), have a heart condition (though cacao is considered fantastic for cardiovascular health, it can increase blood flow to the heart), or are pregnant (women who are pregnant can have wonderful experiences with cacao and it is even used in the birthing process in some cultures, however, as it is a stimulant smaller doses are recommended), please make us aware beforehand, so that we can prepare a less potent dose. Even if you choose not to partake in drinking the cacao, or only drink a little from your cup, you can still join in the journey and feel the energy of the group. You are not obliged to participate in any part of the ceremony. We value your sovereignty and will only invite you to join in the magic, the choice is always yours. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Thank you for being curious about the power of plants, our allies in awakening. "}
