[ KHN: Survivors Of Gangs And Gun Violence, These Women Now Help Others Navigate Grief ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/survivors-of-gangs-and-gun-violence-these-women-now-help-others-navigate-grief/) When April Roby-Bell joined the Gangster Disciples in middle school, the street gang treated her like family when she felt abandoned by her own. She was looking for love, acceptance, and stability. \"They trained us as little kids. How to own your 'hood, own your street: 'This is my territory,'\" Roby-Bell said. The experience also taught her tough lessons about life and death at an early age. At least half of the friends she grew up with are now dead. \"At times, it became hard because you just get tired of fighting,\" she said. \"I probably should have been dead a long time ago.\" (Anthony, 12/23) [ KHN: Seasonal Cooks' Secret Sauce: Zest ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/heritage-nutrition-cultural-recipes-healthy-eating/) Oldways Ambassadors Brenda Atchison and Glorya Fernandez walked a KHN reporter through two cooking demonstrations to showcase modern takes on cultural classics \u2014 like a cold black-eyed pea salad just in time for the new year, and a garlicky dill mojo sauce served over spinach salad.

The three-year-old state law allows law enforcement officials or family members to seek a court order to seize the guns of a person who poses a threat to themselves or others. But the Club Q shooting underscores a fundamental challenge for it and other red flag laws: Sheriffs often refuse to use the measures based on a belief that they infringe on the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.
