In This Article Vladimir Putin Exits Nuclear Security Pact, Citing 'Hostile Actions' by U.S. Saying relations with the United States have deteriorated in a \"radically changed environment,\" President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia withdrew Monday from a landmark nuclear security agreement, in a troubling sign that the countries' cooperation in a range of nuclear areas could be threatened.

The overall activity of radiocesium in these products was found to be within the limit of tolerance in respect to Japanese and also international regulations, but there is still radiocesium found at activities greater than this level in edible wild plants, wild mushrooms and game such as boar meat.

Seventy-one years later, and decades after the end of the Cold War, these weapons continue to bedevil diplomacy, discourse and the planet itself.

The rights group said on Thursday the government has carried out at least 30 likely chemical weapons attacks in the Jebel Marra area of Darfur since January using what two experts concluded was a probable blister agent.

The new facility is needed to keep nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines deployed, according to an environmental impact statement made public Friday.

The Joint Improvised-threat Defeat Agency (JIDA) challenge, held 13-21 September at Fort Benning, tested industry vendor equipment from around the United States in order to counter enemy improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in culverts.

A research group in the university's Centre for Radiochemistry Research examined how phosphorus and other so-called \"soft\" elements interacted with thorium, a radioactive metal that can be used as fuel in nuclear energy production.

The radioactive element comes with a lot of technical and regulatory baggage. Now, a team at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Washington State University have used fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to take a close look at the element's inner electronic secrets when it finds itself in the superficially simple compound "}
