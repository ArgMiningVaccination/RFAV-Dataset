One remarkable accomplishment of higher education in theUnited States is It's ability to combine the concept of a limited number ofelite institutions cn the one hand and a massive enrollment on the other.Furthermore the conditions and dynamics in the US vary considerably fromthe European setting. The division of power between the federal and stategovernment results in 50 considerably different higher education systemswhich is of course a paradise for comparative analysis and naw ideas.One component of the research project \"Policy Instruments for HigherEducation in the Europe of the Future\", was my visit to the United Statesfrom April to July 1990. During this time I had a number of interviews withacknowledged experts in the field. The interviews were not strictly limited tothe basic questions of the research project, but also Included a picture of UShigher education entering the new decade of the nineties.Twenty interviews were scheduled but due to circumstances beyond mycontrol, three had to be cancelled and two were written contributions. Theremaining fifteen interviews were taped and written summaries were sent tothe participants for comments. The interview summaries are organized intothis publication.This material is, in combination with a literature study, analyzed in thepublication: 'Fast Forward with Higher Education in the United Education inthe United States. In Search of the Dynamics of Higher Education.'I would like to thank the persons who I interviewed for their time andenthusiasm during this exchange of ideas. This enriching experience hasbeen helpful in understanding the complexity of the US higher educationsystem (s).Being a Dutchman (despite the English name), the English language is onlyone of the four basic languages that inhabitants of my small country aresupposed to learn. Therefore, I am grateful to Dr Tomlinson who assistedme in editing the draft interview summaries. For the final editing however, Iam responsible for any possible inconsistencies in the English/Americanlanguage.Finally, I would like to express my acknowledgments to the DirectorateGeneral of Higher Educatinn and Scientific Research of the Ministry ofEducation and Science in the Netherlands who provided the facilitiesrequired for this study. Olaf mc-Daniel.leiderdorp, January 1991. 5 III SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHDR MARVIN PETERSON CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HIGHn AND POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGANANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, MAY 9, 11190Interim Summary 01STRONG AND WEAK SIDES OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMThe strongest side in the U.S. higher education lies in deep transition ofautonomy from the federal government i.e. education is left to the states.This autonomy is combined with the strong belief that education should beavailable for everybody.Higher educabon has contributed significantly to society and will/shouldcontinue to do so in the future. It helped us to a idress our serious andthreatening national problems and has appeared to be responsive tochanging needs.In some cases when the response of higher education institutions was slowor absent institutions were not fulfilling their tasks In an appropriate way,W6responded by: afounding new institutions (examples: M.I.T., military academicsand the land-grant colleges);the support for new part to the system by government (ex: thecommunity colleges).The system is very responsive, but this does not imply necessarily that theindividual institutions are. There is always a gap between existinginstitutions where new ones spring up and then become the bridge toinnovations within existing institutionsThe innovative attitude is the result of:the market orientationthe autonomy, that provides the flexibility to create newcorporations of institutionsHigher education in the U.S. has explicitly done yell at: aoffering high quality education for the very able studentsupporting the research at institutions; it took two world wars forthe federal government to decide that universities were goodagents for research. Since the post-war period federal grants forresearch have been available.opening up access for a large percentage of the population so thatvirtually everyone who wants to kvnafit from higher education cando so. Tho in,roduction of the community college system was amajor factor in accomplishing this.In the past some states advocated free public higher education for everycapable citizen. The best example was California with its Masterplan. Overthe years with the introduction of the government student aid programs, theattention shifted to an alternative way of creating access to education.Currently even foreigners are taking advantage of the flexible conditions forthe establishment of institutions. Corporations and higher ec'ucatio,; 6 1 institutions from Japan are investing In the U.S. to create number ofJapanese universities hers.WEAKNESSAlthough the system has a large number of positive aspects, a number ofweaknesses appear as well. 1Minorities and low income groups.Not providing recess to minotitles and/or low income grows inthe U.S. is one of the greatest weaknesses. This Is not only afinancial problem, but It also reflects the cultural dominince of thegroups that make it to the universities now. 2Lack of global perspective.Higher education is Just now discovering that internationalizationis an imposing challenge that needs to be addressed. For thefuture it will not be sufficient to continue the current trend to sanda few students to foreign countries. It will be necessary to expandour knowledge regarding foreign cultures and languages. In thatrespect our skills are way behind the level in most Europeancountries. Higher education in the U.S. has been locally,regionally, or at best nationally oriented. 3Opportunism and elitism.There is a sense of opportunism and elitism in the behavior ininstitutions in U.S. higher education. A good example again isinternationalization.When looking for Pireign institutions with whom to cooperate in Europe forinstance, the best known institutions overseas have priority. It is of littleimportance that there are other, perhaps more interesting institutions. Theone that is known is chosen.Secondiy, the responsiveness of the institutions is often directly related tothe availability of external sources. This sometimes leads to rapid swingsresulting from the political scenes. A number of years ago initiativessupporting the study of Iranian culture were heavily federally supported andIran was flooded with U.S. researchers. When the political relationsseriously changed, the grants dried up and the expertise vanished. CHALLENGESMajor challenges for the future are: 1The global perspective. 2Improvement of minority participation. 3Determining adequate skills for survival in internationalcompetition. We need better trained manpower ready to respondto future challenges in a global market In which the U.S. Is 3 lessof the dominant figure.4Strategies for response. Priorities come and go, needs change.The political:ena surrounding tAgher education is A major source of newideas, points of interest. In the past, money was poured into:libraries in the 1950's,research laboratories after the Russian launch Sputnik,money for the devek pment of new areas of knowledge,student loans when groups in society wero failing to enter highereducation.1 he money was granted as either investment money to set up aninfra-structure or an incentives to respond changing needs. When the 72 priorities change, the funded under a previous priority program eitherbecomes part of the system or it falls behind.Also, in a number of state universities, the notion of need for some planningfor the achievement of present and future policy goals is emerging. TheUniversity of Michigan now has formulated three broad mandates. It plansto become:aa multi-cultural institutionan Institution for 21st Century in education and technologyinternationally oriented institutionIn order to be able to meet future needs, $40 million was invested in a fiberoptics communication system that will facilitate access to comingcommunication and data-transport inventions.This institutional planning strategy emphasizing themes and investments orincentives is between planning oriented and laissez- fake strategies asopposed to directing the institution, the philosophy is to guide the variousdepartments in the direction desired. 4Supply and Demand of FacultyMany faculty will retire in this decade while the supply of levytalented faculty is limited due to a decline in interest in pursuingacademic careers. The problem is both financial (competition withcorporate enterprises In some but not all disciplines) and cultural(the loss of esteem cf universities has its effect on the desire tostart such a career). Unfortunately this threatening issue Is notsufficiently understood by the present faculty. Not enough effort isinvested to convince students (at the high school or college level)of the challengos of an academic career involving the generationand transfer of knowledge. FEDERAL ROLE IN HIGHER EDUCATIONThe federal governments primary role is the distribution of research moneyand student aid. Furthermore the federal government provides (statistical)data as an information service.In addition to federal legislation and court decisions there is substantialinfluence on higher education. This irs most influential on administration andmanagement. Higher education institutions have been declared to be\"commercial enterprises\" and therefore have to operate consistent withinterstate commerce legislation. This implies that higher educationinstitutions are submitted to:legislation and juris prudence of labor retention arrangements(collective bargaining)legislation and jurisdiction on other employment issues, such asaffirmative actionannual publication of salariesFurthermore the federal government has played an increasingly importantrole in the funding of higher education through the funding of research andsupporting of priority areas such as the participation of minorities and lowincome students. The influence of public, but also on private, highereducation has increased through these mechanisms.More direct influence is embodied in the state policy. The states have primeinfluence on public higher education. The fifty states all have differenthigher education policies and traditions. It can vary from Hawaii where thehigher education institutions are run from a cabinet level office within thegovernor's office to the a state such as Michigan, where there is nostate-wide coordinating agency. 8 3 ACCOUNTABIUTYThere have been calls for accountability since the 1950's, but the content ofwhat the government was asking institutions to be accountable for differed.In the 60's the call was for better data institutions asked for more money for\"increasing student enrollment and buildings, but we don't even know howwell utilized our facilities were\". In the 60's the attention was focused on thestudent protests eget your act together, students should be learning insteadof rioting\"). The 70's was the decade of attention for improved efficiency andmanagement. In the 80's the call was for more effectiveness and improvedinstitutional planning.The notions of quality and quality assessment went through similarpatterns. First the discussion emphasized resources (e.g. how much moneydo you need to run an institution) as an input variable. Later it shifted toreputation (how good is the facuity, how good are your students) and expertjudgments. Neither of these instruments have been convincingly auccessfui.The most recent development is the attention to both qualitative andquantitative output data (the number of graduates, how many of graduatesget a job, or more sophisticated measures or value added notions).The reality is that when states have gone from one accountability trend toanother. The political arena is such that it is constantly shifting. Whateverinformation they get, it will never be adequate for the state to reallyunderstand (or govern) the peculiarities of higher education. The quest forinformation therefore will be merely directed to what they perceive to be thecurrent major issue.Accountability is and will be a permanent fixture In the relationship betweenhigher education and Its major public agency. An interesting accountabilityfor further study will be \"impact of higher education on student andsociety\". In the long run politicians expect to get a pay-off on theirinvestments in higher education. In particular they will be interested inresults in terms of a strong economy, an improvement in the quality of lifeor answers to the question: is the state attracting more internationalcorporations?QUALITYThe only really effective approach to improving teaching quality is toconvince faculty of their responsibilities toward the students. The issue is,fortunately, drawing attention. At national conferences on higher education;which in the past were always dominated by financial, managerial andgovernance issues, the quaiity of education is on the agenda. These issuesare finally being addressed.Tha discussion is focused on a number of topics of including the eternalbattle between general education (leading to broad intellectualcompetencies such as problem solving, integrative thinking versus thedisciplinary specialization. Another is the rethinking of the concept ofquality. Would probably always do considerably better than most otherstudents. What is it that makes good students learn even better?INSTITUTIONAL MISSIONSThe importance of the formulation of inAtutIonal statements is heavilyoverestimated. Institutional missions are usable dS Implicit values ratherthan explicit statements. What can a mission be more than a collective ofinstitutional performances. Few people will be aware of the mission of theirinstitution. In practical terms it serves a purpose for the contact between thouniversity and the state. It does not and never will in any way direct thebehavior of faculty. 4 SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHDR EDWARD R. HINES CENTER FOR HIGHER EDUCATIONILUNOIS STATE UNIVERSITYNORMAL, ILLINOIS, MAY 10/11, 1990.Interview summary 02STRENGTHS IN US HIGHER EDUCATIONThe strengths of the US higher education are numerous. A distinctivefeature of US higher education which was pointed out by the 1982 report ofthe Carnegie Foundation is access and opportunity for students. Highereducation opportunities come close to universal access, a concept of publicservice which results in credentiallIng. In virtually every geo-political unit inthe US a college has been founded. In a society that stresses credentialling,access and opportunity are vital phenomena. But the higher educationsupply itself does not guarantee quality and productivity. The tensionbetween access and selectivity has been a major political issue over the last30 years. In practice, this system results in a mixed performance includinginstitutions with \"give-away-degrees\", representing shamefully low exitstandards.By European standards, it is shocking that higher education institutionshaving few performance standards exist and attract large numbers ofstudents. Centrally approved standards give at least soma notion of anacceptable qualitative minimum on the European side of the ocean. Thediversity in the US system and the fact that only a small section of thepopulation has any notion of the different quaRty standards amonginstitutions and departments, implies that the vast majority of the public isnot well informed about higher education quality. In fact, a large section ofthe population does not aspire to attend an Ivy league institution or anInstitution with a national reputation. CredentiallIng is the striving motive.Other main concerns In the college selection patterns are cost and closenessto home. Institutions which meet these needs appeal more to the studentssense of reality and familiarity.The credentialling of the US society has been well described and analyzedby Freeman in his book, \"The Over-Educated American\". The USpost-secondary education system strives for an over-educated society whichis highly credentialized, but not necessarily educated. This choiceautomatically builds in the seeds of discontent about the quality ofinstitutions.Consumer awareness and the philosophy of giving stuOsnts greater choicewere major concepts behind the introduction of the Peil-Grant and theStafford-Loan programs. The functioning of the market supposes a notion ofthe quality of institutions reflecting judgments abou; ndergraduateeducation and student output. However, insufficient in;nrmation oninstitutional quality is available presently, In reality quaill; is associated withfaculty reputation related to research and student input as measured byadmission requirements. Both give no information whatsoever on thequality of the undergraduate level.After an Illinois State Commission report was published a few months ago,the legislators decided not to implement major structural changes in thestate higher education system, but to concentrate on the issues ofproductivity and accountability. Output oriented measures; such as, facultyproductivity, graduation rates, retention rates, attrition rates, turnover,1 o6 research and scholarly productivity, service contribution, library holdingsand other indexes are now or will be available to monitor Institutionalperformance. But it is just a start. The Interest for the Issues related to thecontribution of higher education to societal well-being and economicgrowth has risen over the past decade. Publications like A Nation at Riskcreated a public awareness that (higher) education Is important and coulddo better. However, higher education has not been able to sell itself to thelarger public. It has not yet found an effective and understandable way ofcommunicating with a larger public, which of course Influences thepossIblittles of receiving public support for Increasing public grants.Other strong features in the US higher education system are the diversity inthe system, superior intellectual and academic strength In prestigiousinstitutions and the externalities of contributions to public welfare andculture.MINORITIESQuality in too many higher education institutions in the US is sacrificed forthe survival of institutions resulting in a devalued college degree. Thisproblem is especially reflected in attendance of minorities. For these groupsthere are more limited chances and higher education credentials will notalways contribute to a better life. In an extreme scenario what is the valueof a college degree if ultimately one ends up with employment with lowesteem and wages or even being unemployed? Why make the effort to goto college when the costs result in great debt? Insufficient improvement ofopportunities In society is one of the causes of the stagnation in minorityenrollment. In spite of special efforts and programs, the enrollment of blackstudents In particular has even declined.OVERBUILTHigher education in many states is heavily overbuilt. Too few peopleresponsible are willing to admit this error because of its politicallyconsequences. The decision to open a new campus is a political decisionand a victory for the district representative. To close one down is not thebest contribution to reelectioni Sooner or later however, states will have toface the consequences and adjust the number of campuses to the realdemand and stop \"mothballing\" campus facilities as is the case inWisconsin.STATE INFLUENCEAn important issue for the future is the relationship between universitiesand the state agencies. Much discussion has been dedicated to this issueover the past number of years. States distribute funds to higher educationinstitutions in a variety of ways. States are responsible for financialallocation of operating budgets to the institutions, program review, and theproduction of management information.The way in which state authorities execute their powers in the budgetdistribution varies considerably from state to state. Some examples ofdifferent types of state power to influence the budget distribution tocampuses after a sum of money has been submitted to the state highereducation agency include the following:lump sum distributions*review budgets* comments on budgets*budget recommendations* budget vetoes\"submitting a consolidated budget for all public h.e.budget formulationIn general, the relationship between state government and institutions canbe described as a \"partnership that involves mutual benefits for both theinstitution and the state. The re!minnship will change over the years, asii 6 circumstances change. But it also can change with the Issues at hand. Thebattle of influence has to be refought for every Issue. Circumstances andconditions will change, sometimes predictable but often in a unexpected orunplanned way. Therefore, it Is not possible to define the relationship In apermanent, explicit and detailed way for a number of years. It Is importantthat the decision on the demarkation of power is not taken unilateral.Dialogue and disuusslon based on mutual respect and understanding of thedifferent responsibilities are important ingredients to keep the relationshipmeaningful. The state has no power in what Berdahl called \"substentiveautonomy\", nor should it try to seek that power. The institutions shouldunderstand that the state has 'procedural\" influence and that It Is not per sewrong to use thls power. The state government should understand thatunlimited extension of procedural powers can, as Mortimer and F. Bowencommented, intrude Into the substantive autonomy of institutions.STATE REGULATIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMYThe first empirical data on the relationship of state regulations andinstitutional behavior was provided by Volkwein. Surprisingly, it showedthat there was little relationship between regulation and quality. At theIllinois State University a research project by graduate students wasrecently undertaken to provide further data on this issue. Issues studiedincluded: regulations with respect to dismissal of tenured faculty caused byfinancial exigency and sex-discrimination in tenure/promotion. It wasconcluded that academic freedom was not reduced or compromised, butthat the decision making authority had boon sharpened and refined by theeffect of the regulations and court decisions in those areas.It confirms the general notion that, exceptions not included, stategovernments have little influence on the substantive autonomy issues andconcentrate on procedural issues. However, the courts in the US systemhave much more influence. Their decisions on vital issues like affirmativeaction and recently on the non-secrecy of peer advice for promotion/tenuredecisions, have been of great influence.QUALITY ASSESSMENTStill one of the unresolved issues is purpose of ,iss,Fasment results. Forexampig:aadministrative purposes which would imply methods and criteriathat differ from the methods used for self-improvement andself-improvement purposes including quality enhancement andproductivity improvement which requires a multiple use ofmeasures.Presently three main methods of quality assessment are used in US highereducation: (1) accreditation, (2) state program review, and (3) a number ofinitiatives by separate institutions.The accreditation process is divided into two types: institutional review andprogram review. Accreditation on the institutional level is performed by anexternal visiting committee which evaluates indicators of productivity at theuniversity level. The data are provided by the institution through a selfstudy. In the program accreditation, a visiting committee concentrates onone or a small group of coherent programs. The curriculum is reviewed,academic folders scrutinized, faculty and students are interviewed In orderto be able to judge how well the curriculum is conceived. Facultyproductivity and use of resources are also studied. Whenever a program oran institution is judged negatively, the accreditation body introduces aprobationary statue which, in fact, means that the next visit, a so called\"interim-visit\" will be within a couple of years instead of a regular term. Thenext step, after another negative judgement, would be the loss of accreditedstatus. Ore consequence of lost accreditation is that the institution loseseligibility In receiving federal appropriations. However, no large institutionhas ever lost institutional accreditation. 7 The accreditation process does not have much effect on the institutionallevel. If accreditation has any effect, it will be at the program level. it doesinfluence to a certain extent the content of the curriculum; and, therefore, isa potential danger to academic freedom. However, on the program level thejudgments of visiting committees are not experienced as intrusion inacademic affairs, because the peers are credentialed and respected expertsIn the field. By agreeing to participate In the accreditation process, theinstitution is subject to peer judgement. The peers are selected according totheir academic standing and status in that field on a national basis. Theseevaluators are not paid for the services except for their expenses.The costs of accreditation are staggering. Institutional costs are related tothe enrollment figures according to a progressive scale. On top of thisannual contribution to organizations that provide accreditation, institutionspay all tne expenses of the visiting teams during their visit. Teams canaccommodate up to 30 persons per visit. Furthermore a number of facultymembers are assigned responsibilities specific to the accreditation process.Institutional preparations for visits require a great investment of time andenergy of many faculty, staff, and administrators for at least a year.MISSION AND FACULTYThere is a distinct relations:dp between quality assessment and institutionalmission. Quality assessment should be used to find out if the institutionalmissions are (being) achieved. Incentives to stimulate faculty should be inline with the missions to be achieved. If the mission is, for instance, theimprovement of teaching, excellent teaching performance should berewarded.In a number of Institutions a merit-based faculty reward system is used. Atleast three categories are distinguished:ainsufficient psrformance, in which the receptance of that judgmenta number of times in a row can lead to dismissal. Facwty withinsufficient performance\" are 3t eligible for pay raises (not eveninflation-compensation),average performance which will lead to inflation-compensation ora small pay raise, andexceptionally meritorious, leading to an annual raise in addition toa bonus payment.The faculty judgment should be in Una with the expected behavior,generated by the goat.dmissions of the Institutions.The following schedule shows the linking of the different loops: 4 mission4faculty performance -1 dicisions evaluationex ____baviortenure evaluationpromotion The criteria used to evaluate faculty performance are numerous, butpredominantly directed toward research in the research universities. A fewexamples:athe volume of federally-funded research grantsthe number of hardbound books, published through a refereedprocess by a well-known publisher in the fieldthe number of articles in a refereed journalthe number of external presentations 3 8 RANKINGRanking institutional performance is generally based on faculty researchreputation. The present rankings are criticized on the one hand because theyare Judgmental, but widely accepted because there are few other methodsfor this type of discrimination.Alexander Astin (UCLA) showed that the main problem is the choicebetween two methods: quantitative and qualitative. The qualitative rankingsare the reputational rankings which are limited in scope, and thequantitative relate to data which might have little relevance for a judgmenton the quality (for instance: are rich schools necessarily better?). Astlnrecommended the talent development arproach which indicates how mucha student developed during his study and is also referred to as the\"value-added\" approach. Some institutions are now trying to developmethods to evaluate the value-added concept (North East Missouri State). GRAPEVINE STATIS11CSOriginally started by dr M.M. Chambers and now collected and analyzed in apublication I edit, the GRAPEVINE statistics show the development in thestate tax appropriation for the operating expenses of higher educationInstitutions. States are the major revenue sources for the support of highereducation. Kent Halstead, a research economist with the US Department ofEducation, collected data providing comparable information on the attitudesof the state legislators on higher education and tuition increases. The datahave been influential over the years in the public discussion on statecontributions.PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOROne of the distinguishing features of American higher education is thecombination of public and private institutions. The statement: \"Most of theprestigious institutions are private\" is commonly heard, but misleading.Among liberal arts collegee, most of the prestigious colleges are private.Among the research universities, there are both public and privateinstitutions represented with a larger number of privates than publics.Under conditions of excess capacity, the entire national system of highereducation would not suffer because of a reduction in the public sector.Under conditions of filled capaeity, a reduction in the private sector mightbe associated with increased demand in the public sector or with lessstudent access and opportunity generally.Present fiscal circumstances in the states lead me to believe that highereducation is not going to be able to be supported at the level that It was inthe past. As a result, higher education is becoming more stratified withsome campuses being more successful at increasing revenue from nontax-sources. The future \"quality difference\" will be experienced more bythese more prosperous campuses, while less prosperous campuses whichare unable to identify revenue-raising mechanisms and who must rely ontraditional tax sources, will become even more mediocre and lessdistinguished. In my Judgement, a number of these \"mediocre\" campuses,should be closed and converted into other public purposes.FOUTICAL AGENDA AND CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTUREHigher education in the US faces in the decade of the nineties, a number ofspecific challenges. In short:aattempting to improve quality and access/opportunityattaining mission differentiation among institutionsmaintaining indepondence/autonomy while contributing to theeconomycieducatinr versus credentialingresponding to uonsumer needs, while not compromising values The political agenda shows, in my opinion, the following luues: ainability to close Institutions & programsmaintaining or Increasing accountability while not destroyingautonomy'states: shift from open-ended budget to foundation plus smallincrementsfederal government: maintaining student access, basic researchand management informationlocal government: supporting community colleges. t) 10 SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHMARIAN L. GADE UNIVERSITY OF CAUFORNIA AT BERKELEYCENMR FOR STUOIES IN HIGHER EDUCATIONBERKELEY, MAY 15, 1990Interview Summary 03PUBUC AND PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATIONThe relationship between public and private institutions for higher learningis a typical feature of U.S. higher education.Recently, Clark Kerr and Governor John Ashkroft (Missouri) started a study,released in June 1930 for the Education Commission of the States on futurestate policy towards private higher education institutions. The states varyboth in the number of private higher education institutions and theirattitudes toward it. One state (Wyoming) has no private institutions at all.There are 6 states that actually fund private higher education directly. Somestates, such as California, can not fund private institutions because of theirconstitution. About half the states pay a fair amount of attention to theprivate higher education institutions.If all stiidents who now go to private h!gher education institutions were toenroll in the public institutions, it would require an additional 12 billiondollars per year. The private system actually releases the pressure on thepublic system and it provides a great diversity.Some of the institutions of higher education which are private are both thebest and the worst examples. There are many different ways of looking atPuality.It is important to find out what a particular consumer wants from education.Single standards in a highly diverse higher education system aremeaningless. People can really choose. There is a market for practicallyeverything, even for education of limited standards which even then canbenefit some. Often these colleges provide education that will benefit themmore than the ivy league institutions whose education is directed to the topstudents, If they would enter, there is little chance that they would be able tokeep up with the other students.Therefore, standards in the U.S. higher education play a different role thanin Europe. Many of the lesser colleges\" provide educational settings forcertain students. Prestige is more in research activities such as the numberof Nobel prizes or the number of prestigious professors. QUALITY AND STUDENTS CHOICEQuality and information on quality plays a role in the choice of a graduateschool. High school graduates are not as influenced by quality except for thegeneral opinion that some institutions are \"top-notch\". Given the currentnotion of quality, it is questionable if the prestige of the graduate faculty isthe most relevant !nformation for 17 and 18 year old students. Thor. aremany other reliable choice variables, but most students know little abouttheir options. Research In California shows that most freshmen have littleknowledge of the educational supply in California. Furthermore, they areonly familiar with the Ivy league institutions on the East coast. Thethousands of institutions in the middle remain unknown to them. They aroso to speak: \"bi.coanal\". 1 G11 Actually there is much information available In college guide books. Thereare public and private school counselors who help students find anappropriate college and help them through the admission procedures.Information available in rankings often relates to departments and thatinformation is only relevant to juniors and seniors. Institutional rankilgsinclude limited information about the first years of college or generaleducation. In the U.S. modal students select majors much later than in mostEuropean countries. In addition, there is a great amount of studentmigration of students changing majors in the U.S.CHALLENGES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE FUTURE 1More responsiveness to a society that soon will consist of 1/3minorities. Their participation rate should increase. The drop-outrate in high school should go down and enrollment inpost-secondary education should be strengthened. Manyprograms are set up to increase enrollment. This participation isnot only a matter of equal choice, but also an economic necessity. 2A massive retirement of faculty is expected in this decade. Thesepeople will have to be replaced. One of the problems in somefields such as engineering is that salaries in private enterprisemore attractive than the salaries in higher education institutions. 3The issue of whether the undenraduate curriculum should includea more general education. The discussion is more heated thanenlightening, but is important because different times requiredifferent answers. And even if the only consequence is aconfirmation of existing policies, the discussion has value. 4Assessment and evaluation of outcomes started as an issue ofaccountability for public money spent. For a time it looked as ifstates would become very intrusive. The most dominant modelwas Florida which served as an example of how things should notbe handled. The states have recognized that it is the primaryresponsibility of the institutions to develop techniques forassessment. 5Money always remains a challenge. 6The question of governance of institutions. In several states theissue is now being readdressed again. There has been, for a longtime, a tendency for more centralized control while at the sametime other segments of society were going towardsdecentralization. Examples of that aremanagement-on-the-shop-floor and more school site control inthe K-12 example. A number of states have consideredconsolidating all their institutiuns into a single governingstructure. But most have not done it. Maryland was the last thatconsolidated all but two institutions into a single system whichwas partly an answer to the lack of money. Some legislators andgovernors seem to think that if you somehow would centralize andget rid of all these extra boards you would be betteroff.\u00b0Governors want just one phone number to call with respect tohigher education. This tendency comes with less money becausethey want their money well spent. 7The contribution of higher education to the economy. Manybusiness-higher education contracts are established now. Thedanger is that higher education may promise too much: theinstitutions will not be able to carry out all they negotiate withoutjeopardizing their mission, priorities and autonomy. Let's hopethat higher education is not so greedy that they will end up asservice institutions to big money. 1 '7 12 8For California now the big question is expansion. The universityhas proposed opening three new campuses in the next decadewhich can only be realized if the present formal cap on statespending is lifted.HOW MANY HIGHER EDUCATION GRADUATES DO YOU NEED?Clark Kerr has done some studies on this issue. The latest data shows thataround 25% of the labor force is in the technical and professionaloccupations. These people will definitely need some form of post-secondaryeducation. But we don't educate Just for the labor market; we also wanteducated citizens for cultural and civic reasons and for personal enrichment.Important In the estimation of future needs of higher education graduates isthe fact that about half the training for the job, actually takes placeon-the-job rather than in school. There are so-called \"corporateclassrooms\" where there is formal education but there are 12 1/2-13 millionstudents In the non-formal sectors receiving specific training. Furthermore,a lot of on the job training tfikos place on the work floor in terms of \"I'llshow you how this machine works\". The costs for these types of educationare paid by the consumers. I have never been as convinced that there is adirect link between higher education and labor market as most of Europeangovernments seem to think. Some professions can be excluded from thisgeneral approach and those are professions where higher education is theonly route to it, such as the medical professions, accountancy or law. Forsome of these professions some central planning could theoretically bepossible. But in practice too many doctors become specialists resulting in ashortage of general practitioners and perhaps an over-abundance ofpsychiatrists on Madison Avenue in New Yorkl They are not locatedgecgraphically where you need them. This problem does not end witht.'ducation. We have left the places to the market and figure that the peopleWO make their own choices and do their own planning.Recent figures show that the lifetime earnings for higher educationgraduates are still considerably more attractive compared to those whohaven't enjoyed post-secondary education.It is vnlikely that educational policy can be closely connected to the labormarket because of the mobility of the work force. Employers are moreinterested in a college degree which proves that the student has somestability, some general education, and they know how to solve some typesof problems.The signals that are received from the enterprises vary according to thelevel within the corporation. atop executives/business leaders ask for \"a good generaleducation\" for someone who is adaptable and has shown thathe/she is able to learnthe managers of the personnel departments are more interested inan accountant or; requiring more professional oriented skills. MASTERPLANThe California Masterplan has been reviewed every 15 years, the first timein 1975 and now again. The main outlines have been reaffirmed but thecommunity colleges have recruited more attraction to strengthening them.The masterplan lays down the missions and the clientele for the threesegments of higher education in California. Further planning goes on withinthese segments and as part of the appropriation process of the legislative.Most c.; the planning is not directive, telling someone what to do, but moreproviding information, forecasting of trends avid advising the legislators.Many states have centralized governing boards, but California has a moredecentralized structure, with a coordinating, rather than governing, board. 13 The community colleges were meant to serve an Important tool In Californiahigher education. But the enrollment figures have dropped since a $50tuition was introduced a few years ago. They were meant to be analternative route into the university system. A graduate could enter the third(Junior) year of the university after completing a community collegeprogram. But many students still choose a university for the freshman year.This causes many problems. The transfer function is an important functionof community colieges. The functlons are:provide transfer education to the universities (junior level)occupati .mal/vocstional training leading to an associate degree orcertificatecommunity servicesA lot of the problems are \"technical:\" for example, how to measure thetransfer rate and what to think about the reverse transfer (students whoalready have a bachelor degree and go back to take a few courses). Theuniversity has now strengthened relationships with community colleges inorder to make transferring a smoother process.Students from a community college perform as well as \"native\" studentswho started at universities. The articulation (acceptance of credits) is aproblem that is now solved by articulation agreements between institutions.Their is considerable influence by the university on the community collegecurriculum that provides transfer courses.STATE GOVERNMENTSThere hap been remarkably little intrusion from the state in academic affairsin California over the years. The master plan has very h10 credibility and itminimizes government intrusion and has allowed rational growth. Beforethe master plan, there were a large number of bilis in the legislature toestablish state colleges. Every leglslator wanted a higher educraoninstitution in his county. The master plan rationalized the decision process.It has been successful. The state has been very supportive. The University ofCalifornia is provided for in the state constitution. It has constitutionalautonomy. Compared to many other states the position is relatively good.The universiti receives a lump sum budget.COMPETITIONCompetition ie a characteristic of U.S. institutions of higher education.Private institutions (although they only enroll 22% of the total number ofstudents) are an important factor. Clark Kerr used to say: \"Berkeley wouldnot be as good as it is if it were not for Stanford as a competitor andstandard setter\".The competition on the whole is a good thing. It can be weJteful wheninstitutions duplicate courses, but they have to compete for students andthis will enhance market orientation. The competition has brought us muchbetter education than we otherwise might have gotten.WEAK SIDESIt is true that research has in all aspects received the major attention andrewards. We train the faculty for research tasks and then we send them outto teach. Teaching should got far more attention and honor. The presenthierarchy in which it almost looks like \"the less teaching the moreprestigious\" is not productive to 'Lhe missions of most of the researchinstitutions. It is interesting that Stanford's president has Just come out andsaid that they were planning to emphasize teaching more and research less.It will be really interesting to see how that goes.The quality questionthere is great variation, this is both a strength and aweakness. There should be constant attention to quality. It is difficult tomeasure what students have learned during their period at the university,1 ;) 14 which Is primarily what demonstrates the quality of education. If therewould be an outside imposition of standards this would give Inaltutions avested interest In raising the admission standards. This could exclude manyof our present students from the system and it would be unfair to theinstitutions who are willing to enroll very under- prepared students andbring them as far as possible. Nevertheless, a few students who are noteducated at all graduate from higher education institutions.flUALITY ASSESSMENTThe department-by-department peer review is the most reliable method ofassessment. University-as-a-whole assessment has little rekvance. You canevaluate the quality of programs, see what kind of student., thw turn out,whet kind of jobs they get. You can look at facilities, you can look at howmuch the faculty publishes, whether it is high quality and/or breakthroughs,if they win prizes. The people in the field know that the best, nutgovernment organizations.ACCESSIMUlY OF THE SYSTEMLooking at the prices for the best private higher education institutions onemust take into consideration that the tuition rates are heavily discounted bythe student aid provided by the institutions. The institutinns annually spendover $2 billion in student aid. For some institutions, es much as 25% of theireducational and general budget goes xi, student aid, 2t ) 15 SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHOR GARY RHOADES CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HIGHER EDUCATIONUNIVERSITY OF ARIZONATUCSON, MAY 21, 1990Interview Summary 04WEAK AND STRONG SIDESSome of the strengths are at Zhe same time tile weakness of thbsystem. The first issue I access. The U.S. system has great access as wellas very high rate of student attrition while European universities enjoy amuch better retention rate. If the dropouts are not included in theenrollment and graduation trends, then the percentage of graduates in theU.S. system of higher education will not be very different from Europeencountries. To complicate the U.S./European comparison of the number ofstudents who have access to higher education, one must consider the typesof institutions labeled as higher education in both settings. Mostcomparable institutions in Europe to the U.S. community colleges are notconsidered to be higher education institutions. On the surface it looks likethe U.S. Is providing a lot of access, but if one would really try to comparethe figui es to Europe there is less difference than we often admit.Sociological studies show also that status attainment in job mobility doesnot differ significantly from the European countries.A second issue is strong graduate education in the United States. Ger.erallyche Quality of education up to the undergraduate level is without doi)btbelow European stanCards. However, as soon as American students reachthe graduate level, the educational experience is more systematic andrigorous than in Western Europe.The third issue, the autonomy, is not necessariiy a positive characteristic.The autonomy of U$ higher education is perhaps heavily over estimated. Itis true that in the US tere Is no influential federal ministry, but thwo arsgovernmental agencift end federal courts that in many ways intrude intoacademic decision making as much or mo're than European ministries. Thedifference is not that we have a weak federal ministry that does not intrude,but rather than a vast bureaucracy the US has various levels and branchesof governance which yields a very profound impact.A recent court decision on the openness of dossiers regardingtenure and promotion stresses that it is a very powerful intrusion inpcademic affairs, Decisions can now be brought to a court for arbitration.Affirmative action cases have the same effect in that universityadministrators must handle these Issues likewise, whether in admissions orpersonnel policy. This is why the autonomy is not one of the subjects thatcould be stressed. Most American produced cross-country higher educationreviews by the mainstream social scientist give the impression that the USsystem is more or less laissez-faire,\" but I would strongly disagree.When they study government structures, they mostly look at the formalbureaucracies that overlook the institutions, without paying much attentionto the othor influential governing branches. In the U.S. even the privatesectors are heavily tied to government.They go through the same procedures of accreditation and assessment.They rely largely on (100!.nmental funding through student aid or by meansof research monay. 0.k.17 Fourth, I would be less inclined to emphasize diversity even though on theface of it we have greater diversity than the European institutions. Probablythe top 200 research institutions are quite similar on either coast or in theheartland of America, public or private. They look the same and they verymuch work the same. The diversity really comes in as you move way downthe hierarchy of institutions. Compared to Europe that is the same thing,only the type of institutions that are considered as the diversifying factor arenot categorized as higher education in Europe. We call virtually everythinghigher education. About a third of that is in community colleges and thebulk of that is in vocational programs, not the transfer programs. Theconfusing thing I. that the majority of students who enroll in a four yearuniversity program from a community college transfers from vocationalprograms. This alternative route is followed by many students. There Is nolimitation to higher education consumption. If you are accepted and polyyour tuition, you are accepted and the state will grant the institution MI's.Within the top 200 the difference on the institutional level is not a relevantindicator, although the tuition fees may differ tremendously. By the natureof the work the emphasis on g aduate education, the emphasis on researchare all the same. The differences in quality per discipline ere neverthelessrelevant. The harder the science the greater the fall off in quality. The costsand equipment are unaffordable for the lower ranked institutions. Therankings in these institutions indicates also the level of funding.I am sure that this type of variety exists in Europe, but it is less publiclyknown. The first attempts to start rankings in Europe are now set up. Theywill probably show greater diversity than is often supposed. In Europe thereis greater diversity than is publicly acknowledged and in the US there is lessdiversity than is publicly declared.COMPETITIONJoseph Ben Davis was right in his article in the early sixties where he relatedadvances in science to the competition within the system. Competition isthe striving feature and it is strongly developed in tho US, importantstimulants have traditionally been the absence of a few dominatinguniversities as the main centers of science and miture like Oxford andCambridge in the UK in the past. In the U.S. there is not one monopolizingcenter for culture and academe but many which has enhanced competitionfrom the very beginning. The competition reflects on all levels and betweenall groups. It stretches out from the competition for the best students, toresearch money and even to competition between states. The legislators areaware of the importance of higher education faculties in their state and haveshown interest in maintaining a variety of facilities and at least one topranked research university. It is important to understand that thecompetition basically generates similarities between institutions, notdifferences. The competition is directed towards the same, or comparable,using the same criteria, From this point of view, competition cannot causenecessarily an efficient division of labor between institutions within orthroughout states. It could lead to inefficient duplication. For some time itwas assumed that state-wide approved or enforced institutional missions,would result In a rational division of labor. California was the only state,using its statewide masterplanning in a division of labor on a central lovi.Still it did not stop the academic drift that is driving tne teachinguniversities. Reputation, better funding and more esteem can only beachieved in research which implies that a single teaching mission leads tolow reputation.QUALITY OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATIONThere Is e general sense, that teaching at most research universities lacksquality. The conditions are poor: classrooms with 200-300 students taughtby inexperienced post-graduate students. The interest of faculty inundei-graduate education is low. The attention that teaching has receivedlately, for instance in the recent speech by the president of Stanford, DonaldKennedy, is promising on the one hand. But as the same time it could lead to cynicism if the administrative behavior is not adjusted. Teaching is notappreciated nowl The resources ars still going to the successfuldepartments in research, teaching performance is valued less for promotionand tenuret.1.1:-421^^4a id star salaries are paid to researchers and not toteachers. Unless this is reversed or at least changed drastically, the impactof staterr,ents like Kennedy's will be zero.In the seventies, the issue of the quality of teaching also had a prominentposition on the agenda. At that time legislators, tried to improve teachingattention and performance by legislative measures that enforced aminimum number of teaching and contact hours between teachers andstudents. Needless to say that implementation and control was not much ofa success.The irony of the U.S. undergraduate quality discussion is that the states payprimarily for undergraduate education and not for research. They like theresearch and are sometimes impressed by the results, but they are notwilling to pay for it. One of the explanations for that might be that theeducational credentials of the legislators show only a limited number oflegislators with baccalaureate degrees let alone advanced degrees. Despitethe attention of the legislators, much of the money within the institutioot lachanneled to the graduate level. The result is a very strong graduate level atthe expense of the undergreauate level.It should be the expectation of the public that institutions providing badeducation are shut down. However, It is politically not feasible tr dr so. Noelected person will be able to survive a re-election campaign with theclosure of a local university on his record.FINANCINGAll major research institutions are engaged In massive fund- raising drives.Private support for public institutions has become financially essential tosupplement the state (and federal research) contributions. In order tointerest industry, states offer potential investors access to public educationaland research facilities. This generates an intense competition for public andprivate money. It exposes the close relationship between capital andacademe. The impressive proportion of corporate money does not leave theuniversity untouched.QUALITY ASSESSMENTThe issue of quality receives much public attention, The present methodsused by outside agencies, accreditation and state wide program review,have not been able to guarantee an acceptable minimum level for allinstitutions of higher learning. Some remarks on both methods.First, the institutional accreditation In practice Is nothing more than anumber of people visiting an institution for a couple of days and studyinginformation that resulted from the self-evaluation. The outcome of theself-evaluation tends to result In the conclusion that more state financialresources are required In order to do (even) better. Often an accreditationvisit is used to get leverage for budget expansion requests to the legislators.The institutional assessment Is nothing but a very minimal examination ofthe institutional performance. Very seldom institutions are put on probation,but never does a public institution go out of business. Institutionalaccreditation does not separate ans wheat from the chaff. The programaccreditation produces more usable results, but is still remains suspicious.Secondly, there Is the state-wide program review of new and existingprograms. In practice this review Is a paper tiger. With a few exceptions,states lack the expertise, staff and resources to be able to enht nce qualitythrough these procedures. The practical effects are minimal, while theprocess generates unproductive bureaucracy for the institutions. 2 ,1 19 Both accreditation and state wide program reviews do not guarantee muchto the consumer. If the countries in Europe are daveloping ideas on qualityassessment, I would advise them not to use these methods.TRANSFER OF STUDENTSThe goal of student mobility is highly desirable in U.S. higher education.However, in practice many students have problernf with transferring fromone institution to another because their credits are :int :Ways accepted.There is no solut on for this paradoxical situation. On the one hand freedomof choice must be guaranteed but the enforcement of acceptance of creditsthat are below one's standard is one of the most smodalous intrusions inacademic affairs ot which one can think. On the other hand, consumerprotection and the facilitation of student transfer is a legitimate policy aimand consumers desire.CONSUMER BEHAVIORQuality assessment ratings can be helpful to consumers to make intelligentchoices. The ratings attract news media and people talk about them.Unfortunately the present ratings are based on faculty reputation and thequality of graduate education which bares little relevance for undergraduateeducation. The main choice factors of distance to the institution and thesocio-economic status of the applicant remain most relevant for theundergraduate.Still, the best impetus for competition is to inform the public on the qualityof the institutions. Quality information is available in many sectors In societyso why should it not be in higher education? There is a danger orvulnerability of the institution when quality Is totally determined by awarning for uncontrolled enhancement of the vulnerability of consumerschoice. It can lead to a single marketing attitude of the instItutions. Boyerwarned for the attitude there is a loss of attention towards the students.Taking that extreme into consideration, it would still be good to have abetter informed public with knowledge on the relative quality differencesbetween institutions.The conditions for a clear market working in the US are not favorable due tothe fact that large segments of the market are not accessible for the majorityof the consumers because: athe expenses are to high (eitner expensive private colleges, orexcessive out-of-state rates tor public institutions)the selectivity of the system eliminates entrance eligibility for thevast majority of students.In Europe the conditions for a market incentive are much better. The lowstate set tuition does not cause anyone to give up aspirations to enter theinstitution because of financial reasons. Furthermore, in most countriesstudents will be accepted In all institutions. Students can select the bestinstitution, or the institution that fits their intellectual abilities most. RESEARCHMuch of the attention of institutional management is addressed to sciences,medicine and pharmacy because those areas represent the disciplineswhere the bulk of federal research money is directeu. This had importantinfluence for the allocation of resources on campus. Around 90% of theresearch funds are federal. And although there is a close connection withcorporate money, the corporate sector has never accounted for a significantAmount of research funding, nor does it intend to do so. 20 INNOVATIONA key-factor in the implementation of change is a strong local bureaucracyon campus. These local administrations have to answer to signals from theoutside world. As is in Europe, the U.S. can create more tradition. All thelaws thinkable can set up all the frameworks that are imaginable, butfaculties on campus will go on and do what they wish to do regardless ofthe legislation and framework. If necessary they will find ways around it.Campus administration is less developed in Europe. Powerful leaders andpowerful administrators have been a key part of promoting innovations inU.S. higher education. This Internal change process is necessary because nocorporate group has ever adequately generated change from within itself.The faculty in higher education is no exception to this rule. You need tohave an external pressure or incentives to change.RESPONSIVENESS TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCESHigher education in the US is responsive through the many groups andparts of society that have access to the system. This type of pressure isstronger and more successful than the effect of influence by largebureaucracies in Europe. It is basic knowledge that regulatory agencies arecloser to the regulator thin to the consumer. Along with the strongercampus administration, it has made higher education more susceptible toexternal influences.A number of influences should especially be taken into consideration: 1Court decisions are influential on higher eoucation policy. Manyindividuals or groups go to court and challenge the institutionaland state, and sometimes federal policy.2The funding sources. Local change agents, who see a potentialityfor the attraction of external sources, will try to create attractivenew structures within the institution.3The problem oriented approach in most curricula stimulatesresponsiveness to changing external conditions.4Governing boards on the institutional or state level can sometimeestablish contribute to the change.5An important feature of the receptiveness is what Martin Trowcalled \"anything goes\" in the US higher education. Using thatexpression Trow expressed the richness and variety andexperimentation in the system which enables new initiatives todevelop without being hindered by a national idea of what auniversity should be and do. 0 r-t) 21 SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHDR AIMS MCGUINNESS EDUCATION COMMISSION OF ME STATESDENVER, COLORADO, MAY 24, 1990Interview Summary 05THE STATE OF U.S. HIGHER EDUCATIONFrom a foreign perspective, highor elication In the U.S. has been especiallystrong in flexibility and in dealing with a highly diverse population with agreat variation of needs. The three code words of higher education whichmake this possible are flexibility, multiple sources of funding, andcompetition.One of the weaknesses in the public system is centralization. At thismoment state governments are trying to serve the noble goal ofresponsiveness through a bureaucratic apparatus which grants moreauthority to governing boards and creates structures over structures.Another weakness is the fact that the Incentives are overwhelminglydirected to a relatively narrow definition of scholarship. It is not only thedominant position of research over teaching; it refers also to the narrowdefinition of values that are derived from the sciences that limit the scope ofjudgement. Those values are drawing energies away from the other basicmissions such as teaching. In a population as diverse as the U.S. population,teaching is important. The country needs a large percentage of thepopulation with post-secondary education. Attention for and quality ofteaching should be positioned highly on the agenda.Higher education is still undo .. the pressure of academic drift. Institutionswith a single teaching mission are confronted with a reputational systemwhich is totally research oriented. Their only way to receive recognition Is toadd research into their basic tasks. When both research and teachinginstitutions are covered by one gover:ling or coordinating board, the modelof the most outstanding research university is (de facto) the model fordevelopment for all institutions. Forces that enhance academic drift are: adisciplinary values;a tightening faculty market iii which faculty can bid up theirworking conditions, including less teaching hours;research is prestige;bureaucratic forces;the fact that most institutional administrators are academicsthemselves.It should be possible to lead the various systems In a way that encouragesdifferentiation. Local boards and diversity of sources of funding can help toguard against academic drift, as Kerr argued.Another weak side in the quality of U.S. education is the secondaryeducation system. For this failure higher education Is partly responsible inthat universities are the primary educators of the teachers in public schools.Finally the quality of undergraduate education is a concern. The feeling isthat institutions are not doing well, and some are even doing mediocre. Theabsence of central standards interferes with clear evaluation of the presentsituation. Some states became very intrusive in an attempt to measure theprogress of a student with the so-called \"mandated testing programs\". The0 023 state of Florida introduced testing and was followed by Georgia and Texas.It seems now that the attention is fading and no more states are consideringthe establishment of that type of program.The great challenges for the coming years will be related not toundergraduate teaching. The connection between secondary andpost-secondary education should be brought to the attention of policymakers. It might be time to reconsider the structure of secondary educationand introduce more streams as the European systems. That effort could bean expression of the nation's commitment to assuring a level of educationattainment of a larger section of the population.FLEXIBIUTY OF THE SYSTEMHigher education is flexible and accessible to external influences. athe structure of the professoratebthe market dimensions of faculty to move across, between andamong institutions. Faculty can bid in a competitive market;cnot only the mobility of faculty is an important contribution toflexibility, but also the mobility of students who move from oneinstitution to another. The credit-system is supportive for studentmigration;ddiversity of funding: all important institutions have a number ofsources upon which they rely; they are not dependent on a singlesource;eit is not governed by a single set of values. The least flexiblesystems are governed by single values. European highereducation is an example of that. Every Innovation must becarefully weighed as to whether it fits tho scheme of what highereducation should be;fthe influence of the federal government is limited;9the system is decentralized, and the flexibility and responsivenessis most effective in those states that have also formulated adecentralized system. Increase of central authority impliesdecrease of institutional responsiveness.It will be an interesting case to see how European higher educationdevelops after the introduction of a single market in 1992. It might create thebasis for a future \"EC-role\" in, for instance, funding of research on acompetitive basis analogous to the federal government funding in the U.S.,to the point where every major institution can get a large contribution.Naturally this will create the problem of nationalities bersuse every countrywill demand a certain share of the pie and indeed there has to be a certainbalance between political and economic distribution of EG-funds. One besisfor consideration is the way the federal money in tha U.S. Is distributed.Whether this type of money allocation will be bureaucratic, will depend onthe standards that are used by the distributing agencies. In many cases inthe U.S. the application for a federal grant requires a research proposal inthe field of expertise of superior quality which is almost a contribution to thedevelopment of knowledge itself.COMPETITIONCompetition is an important tool in the improvement of quality anddiversification. Competition should be directed towards multiple goals andmissions through the system. In the U.S. the system has been weak ingiving evidence on actual student learning, but strong on faculty prestige.Unfortvnately, faculty prestige in research bares little to no relationship withthe quality of teaching. The reason why over the past years the assessmentmovement has developed rapidly, is partially caused by the fact that it isunderstood that competition as a stimulating mechanism for theimprovement of the undergraduate education should serve an Importantrole. In order to try to improve the information to the public, some states didcome up with initiatives. A recent example is the State of New Mexico,where the governor introduced legislation to enforce annual publication of2724 report cards. The information should serve both the consumer in Its choicefor an institution of higher learning, and the public in terms of visibleaccountability to show that they get value for money.Still, the model of the perfect market, in which institutions should be leftcomplete autonomy to respond to external forces is not within reach andprobably never will be. In a number of states, access to higher education isprovided by the legislative decision to accept all qualified state residents tothe state institutions, as in Ohio and Kansas. All applicants are accepted.However, many institutions are selective which limits the function of themarket. A number of activities, directed to improve the enrolling students(improving the public secondary education and remedial programs in theuniversities) assured a low attrition rate.STATE INFLUENCE ON HIGHER EDUCATIONThe variety of governing systems for higher education within the differentstates is significant. For all relevant topics, positions on the spectrum can bemarked. Every state has its own particularities and culture. The level offlexibility varies from centralized to decentralized systems. One of thefactors for determining the level of centralization is the geographic andeconomic dispersion within the state. It is not always possible to deal withthe differences and imbalances of regions by the lewislators. Understandingthe underlying cultures and perspective, values within and history of a stateis an important determinant. It is tradition in most of the western states, thatthe state constitution limits legislators in their leeway to enter into contractswith private institutions to carry out public policy. Even the personal powerof the governor in a state can play an influential role. In some states thepolitical life is shaped by the governor, in other states politics are dominatedby the legislator.To name a few extremes on the flexibility scale-New York is very centralizedand Michigan is relatively decentralized. The level of decentralization isoften a token of political balance and political trust between the legislatorand the higher education institutions. Legislators don't like to deal withunresolvable conflicts. If the balance and trust are not thera, they willprobably choose a more centralized model.The demarcation of power between states, state boards and institutions, isformalized through legislative activities. The autonomy can be grantedeither by the constitution of the state or can be defined by statute.Influential on higher education politics within various states is the level ofaspiration of both the state government and the institutional administration.If the basic attitude is \"that will never be possible in ow state,\" it is not likelythat institutions are stimulated to show more than a conservative andnon-innovative approach. If the institutional administration, the governor orthe legislator are actively taking part in the development of the state system,the institutions will be supported in innovation and experimentation.The general tendency of state policy is an increase of centralization,although a few states like New York and New Jersey, have recently madeprogress in decentralization. New York still remains one of the mostcentralized states. Explanation of this tendency could be:the short term In memory span of legislatorslack of trustthe strive for system visibility. Governors don't like to deal with Aproliferation of different separate institutions: one phone numberwould be the most convenient.Little attention in the state bureaucracies of states with centralized highereducation policy is paid to the possible negative interaction betweencentralization and responsiveness of institutions. Priorities seem to be:how to make the system more accountable 25 how to make the system more responsive to the legislativequestions of why the system is not workinghow to track the money to assure that no money Is wasted.Major problems with increasing centralization Is the effect of so-calledapicket-fence federalism\" in which layers of the bureaucracy, specialized inone pocket,shape higher education policy as a collection of independentdecisions without sufficient knowledge of the system as a whole.The major differences in state higher education policies in terms ofcentralization can be summarized oy looking at the existence of governingboards of coordinating boards. Twenty seven states have a coordinationboard who serve as an interface between the state and the institution. Theylook after the states and system interest; they do not administer institutions.The governing or consolidating boards have a much ma's Influentialposition in that they hire and fire the president control the budget and makeimportant decisions regarding personnel policy. In most cases there ismore than one board per state. Four patterns are visible:institutional arrangements in which there is one board perinstitution (for instance Washington and Virginia)segmental arrangements, with one board for remarchuniversities, one for non-research universities, one for communitycolleges (for Instance-California)states with one state wide board (Ohio, Massachusetts)a mixture of these three arrangements.Many states keep record of what other states do in higher education policy.Copying ideas is often the basis for change. When the governor of Michiganlaunched a pre-payment plan for the payment of tuition-fees for publichigher education institutions, it took the majority of other state less than sixmonths to come up with comparable plans. CHANGE REQUIREDA lot of critique on the higher education systems should not be directed tothe systems. It is the circumstances that change rather than the systemwhich was constructed for another time.It would generally be useful, if states would consider a more firm policytowards decentralization. It could improve possibilities for governance on alllevels. Secondly, a rethinking of financing mechanisms is advisable. A movetowards a more output oriented allocation system could enhance theattention for performance. The schemes used in the Netherlands couldserve as an example. Thirdly, an improvement of the accountability shouldbe considered and it should especially serve a role to inform the public ofthe performances of the system. An already mentioned attempt isundertaken by the State of New Mexico in introducing report cards thatcould serve the public. 26 INTERVIEW WITH DR FREDERICK VOLKWEIN UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANYALBANY, NEW YORKMAY 29, 1990Interview Summary 06STUDYIn 1986 I published the study: \"State financial control of public universitiesand Its relationship to campus administrative elaborateness and cost: resultof a national study\".The study grew out of interest on the amount of state control on highereducation in New York and the lack of autonomy that campuses puts onissues of: apersonnelacadem icfinancial mattersAt that time the New York state system at that time was heavily regulated.As assistant to the president, I decided to do some comparative research.The basic question in the first research was what is the relationship betweenautonomy and the three issues mentioned. In a later stage the element ofquality was added.Surprisingly, the data showed the measures of cost and measures of qualitywere only very thinly related to the measures of regulation. But there turnedout to be a significant relationship between the financial contribution andquality. In other words an institution could 'it does not matter howmuch you regulate me. Give me enough and I will produce highquality teaching and research.\" Only one exception to that finding occurredIn the research and that was the campuses that were the most autonomousraised the most external support. The incentive for those institutions wasthat they could keep the money.In New York this Is not the case, most private income has to be reported tothe stetsAfter the study, a blue-ribbon commission was created to propose changesin the regulations. They used the data of the study and concentrated onsome of the variables that the study did not cover. The study was limited tocampus costs of administration, while the commission took other costs onthe state level into consideration as well as the tempo of change. The speedof innovation in a heavily regulated system Is slowed down considerably.The proposalb of the blue ribbor commission received almost unanimoussupport on the basic outlines. Only one group opposed therecommendations and that was the civil servants employees union. Theyfeared a loss of lobs.The governor and the legislator accepted most of the long laundry list ofrecommended legislative change. Nine of ten proposals were drafted intolegislation. Still New York remains one of the most regulated statesl To geta more accurate picture the study would have to be replicated. Especiallythe financial autonomy is limited. Tuition fees are still treated as stateincome and not as institutional revenues. Furthermore there is not the 21 possibility of carrying money over to the next fiscal year. Which meansthere is no incentive but to spend every dollar in the fiscal year. New York IsIn that respect not a unique state. Around 48% of the states don't grant theinstitutions the power to carry over money. Other examples of lack offinancial and managerial autonomy is the absence of a lump sum budget. InNew York all positions are specified, although the possibility to move fundswithin the institution has Increased. Salaries are set by the state and alluniversity personnel are state employees. The governor signs our checks.An important improvement has been the possibility to offer considerablyhigher salaries to very competent faculty which enables institutions tocompete for faculty.The issues mentioned do not necessarily decrease the influence of theinstitution on its academic mission. But new academic initiatives, like theestablishment of new programs, is also under the Influence of stategovernment. The statewide governing board in New York, called the boardof regents must approve such an extension of the academic work. Theirpower competes with European ministries of education. Their powerstretches so far that public and private institutions alike can not offer adegree or a curriculum without having prior approval. Theoretically a startwithout approval can be made, but the enforcement mechanisms are suchthat the program will not be registered and students will not be eligible forstudent aid.The approval procedure is a complex, mind-boggling process in whichmany authorities take part. It takes between two to four years to get a nowprogram approved, even if the institution has the faculty in place and thestudents banging on the door to get in. The procedure is an impediment toflexibility and slows down responsiveness to changes. New York has in thatrespect the toughest legislation.The major aim of the approval is quality control. The claim is made that theprocedure protects the taxpayers against redundancy, unnecessaryexpenditure of state resources and upholding (academic) standards.The feeling is that free-market forces will lead to a decline in quality. If youlet the institutions go they will offer off- campus instruction with no librariesand poor part-time faculty. The full-time faculty will concentrate onresearch and t his will jeopardize the quality of undergraduate education.Without State control this behavior is enhanced and stimulates people tocheat the taxpayers.Ths study on the effects of the present regulations and quality show a verylimited relationship.This procedures of measuring outcomes, accreditation, state programreviews is probably overkill of instrumentation especially when consideringthat the study shows the limited influence of regulations on quality, evenover a substantial period of time. It would be wiser to concentrate onasressment. The state- university provost of New York has created astite-wide panel which spent the last two years helping the variouscampuses make campus- assessment plans. AlLany has set up a four pointassessment system: 1student basic skills2general education and intellectual growth3attainment in the major4students personal and social growthThe assessment movement creates incentives for faculty to Improveperformance. It leads to public information that can be relevant for studentchoice as well.Still it Cles not effect student's choice severely, because most students gettheir information from the student guide books. The ratings used in those 28 gui les are not very reliable. They are either based on faculty researchreputation or on subjective measuring of institutional quality.But there is a lot of competition to publish these guide books and almostevery year a new book is published. The publishers include a lot of internaluseument, but It is hard to standardize those without nationally acceptedstandards. There is no national consensus on what it is that properlyconstitutes a good undergraduate education. For the graduate education theinformation is more reliable.College choice has never been greater than it is right now. Although somescholars on higher education issues proclaim that colleges are becomingmore alike; in my opinion, they have never been more different. High schoolseniors have a tremendous array of choice, small, large, vocational versusliberal, state, private, expensive, inexpensive.QUALITY OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATIONHow is it possible that with such an overkill of instruments to assess qualitythe issue of quality is still prominent on the higher education agenda?The oversight activities have only an indirect relationship to what takesplbce in the classroom, Still, especially at tho lowerend of higher education, there is much effort to enhance the quality withsuccess. The present attention of university presidents on quality educationat the undergraduate level indicates that improvements have been made.The attention on quality and assessment issues in New York hen definitelyled to improved performance.One of the dangers now is that a growing majority of students do not spendenough time doing their studying, because they spend time gaining moneyto pay tho increasing costs of education or for other more materialisticpurposes.OPTIMUM STATE - HIGHER EDUCATION RELATIONIf a major change could be facilitated politically, the emphasis should be puton post-audit activities and measuring outcomes with no attempt to controlthe input or the process. A large degree of autonomy is requiired for thefinancial issues: introduction of lump sum funding, deregulbcion ofpurchasing, gift incentive for efficient mamigement and enhance as well asreward additional private sources. Worry less about the student and facultyrecruitment and about program requirements, instead concentrate more onoutcomes.Accreditation and program review is a much more constructive way ofholding institutions accountable for their performance than trying to imposeregulations with control processes and decisions. A compromise betweenthe present regulations and new IrotIative could be that new initiatives areaudited more frequently than institutions or programs that have been inbusiness for decades.NEWMANIn his book, \"Choosing for Quality,\" Newman argues contrary to the dataVolkwein has produced, that there is indeed a relationship betweengovernment control and quality of teaching education.Newman's claim is data-free and it is the type of statement that inspired the1900's research which lacks empirical support. His methodology is based ona few case studies within a limited number of states. But he ignores statesthat could provide counter-arguments. But the variety of American highereducation provides support for almost any philosophy. The decisive factorfor determining quality is the performance of faculty and the financialsupport an Institution receives. Greater autonomy of faculty yields greaterfaculty innovation.3c, 29 Giving the faculty autonomy raises the question of faculty loyalty to theinstitutions. It happens that some faculty work on a private basis duringoffice hours, using university facilities. Leadership should aim atstrengthening Taculty loyalty to the institution and faculty concern forstudents. Faculty should at least feel obligated to maximize the quality ofinstruction. Formally there are few ways to rectify this situation. In mostcases it Is not possible to hire a person for Institutional loyalty, concern forstudents, and a commitment to teaching. One of the reasons is an inabilityto implement discretionary salary increases to reward thls type of behavior.On the positive side, it is possible to appeal to people to improve theirbehavior and use Incentives to achieve thls change. Thls issue lathe realchallenge of future leadership. Q.\")t) t) 30 INTERVIEW WITH DR ERNEST BOYER CARNEGIE FOUNDATION, PRINCETON UNIVERSITYPRINCETON, NEW JERSEY.MA's 30 1990.Interview summary 07RESEARCH ON HIGHER EDUCATIONThere has been significant Levelopment in research on higher education inthe United States. After the second world war, new social policy led to anunprecedented expansion of the system. A system that had beendominated, for the most part, by private institutions, now becameincreasingly defined by the public sector. This raised questions about howto manage and govern the new arrangement. This emphasis on publichigher education, along with expansion of the system and other emergingIssues, was an incentive for Increased attention focused on higher educationas a field of study. A growth of the centers of higher education occurred inthe period. During the period of recession there was a reduction In publicattention for higher education in general. Important structural Issues duringthat time were the division of labor in the system, mission statements,accessibility and equality. The latter two Issues need constant attention,especially since minority participation is not increasing but decreasing.Further, there has been a recognition that these matters involve politicalchoices that have to be made, and not merely theoretical designs.The discussion on Internal governance of higher education Institutions hasnot yet led to a substantive theoretical framework. Therefore, much morediscussion, research and thoughtful retrospection will be useful.AUTONOMYThe specific point where the autonomy of an institution begins and ends isundefined. It is more appropriate to use the word \"Integrity\" because nouniversity Is, In fact, autonomous. The question, ultimately Is: How does auniversity maintain its integrity while still being accountable? TheInstitutions are more worr;ed about motley than about possible governmentintervention.The decline of public money for higher education revitalized the debate onthis issue: what is the public obligation to finance higher education?Universities are now caugin in public policy discussions on what thestrategies should be across the full range of social issues, in order to assurea better future and quality of life. There is evidence that the role ofuniversities in that competition has diminished. The political climate is notparticularly favorable for the universities, although the ambivalence is thatparents still want to send their children to college, and they want theireducation to be good.In the 1982 publication of the Carnegie Foundation on control of thecampus, It was pointed out that institutions have not lost their autonomy tothe point of endangering their integrity. This conclusion still stands.In the last decade sini,e the report was published, federal and state activitieshave not seriously threatened institutions. Still, two issues are an exception.First is the connection of eligibility for student grants and the draft. Bycombining these issues, two policies with very different purposes wereconfused. It was remarkable that the universities' Council on Education didnot protest more sharply against this Idea. 34 31 Second is the present interrogation by the United States JusticeDepartrnent, accusing private universities of price-fixing. Is the JusticeDeparttnent overstepping its bounds here, or not? institutions are protestingheavilyBesidas these two issues, the first being much more dangerous than thesecond, thbre are no major examples on the state or federal level that canbe considered as the responsibility of the institutional authorities. Thetradition has bean established that the essentials of academic businesa arenot touched. What is taught, who is teaching, how the results are assessed,how the standards of completion are established by the universitycommunity.In terms of the procedural issues that surround the core business, thedebate is less clear. There can be a point in which the cumulative effects are,perhaps even unintentionally, a threat to the autonomy of the institution.There are questions of efficiency and effectiveness in which governmentintervention can cause loss of responsiveness.The difference between other agencies and higher education is that theessence of highor education should have a non-intended core business. Asfor accountability, universities can be treated Just as other governmentsponsored public services. RESPONSIVENESSThe history of higher education in the United States shows remarkableaccommodation on several fronts: expanding access and the type ofprograms that are established, the creator of new institutions and researchcenters. Universities are capable of innovatinc beyond imagination. Theday-to-day bureaucracy might be frustrating for certain offices on campus,which however rarely stops the university from making major shifts. It is notalways the bureaucracy of government that hinders innovation. In a nmberof cases, these outside forces were the initiators of change. The GI Bill wasoriginally opposed by the institutions out of fear of diminishing standards.Other outside initiatives like the improved access for minorities and thefunding of special research topics have worked out well.Entrepreneurial leadership stimulates creativity. Historically in the Europeancountries, the entrepreneurial spirit did not fit into the scheme. Theuniversity was internally and externally defined according to a uniformmodel. In the United States there were not such rigid definitions. Thcsystem remained more fluid, producing a more favorable culture forexperimentation.Although It varies by institution, most of the institutions are relativelyconservative. They could and should become continuously innovative,always asking the right educational questions. The answers to thesequestions do not always lead to change. External stimulation (preferably notbased on entrepreneurial or marketplace considerations alone) can behelpful as well. A good example is the Fund for the Improvement ofPostsecondary education, which was limited in scope but had an importtntsymboiic impact. Receiving a grant implies recognition after a comp;AitIveselection process. The mainstream of innovations should come fromwith!n, but an incentive that rewards good ideas might stimulate creativeexperimentation,QUALITY OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATIONThe issue of the qualityundergraduate education is today agaiii on theagenda. In reecilt swam.I the decade of the ninaties \"the decadeof undergraduate I:I.:location.\" For the first time since the fifties, this issuewill be debated seriousiy. The evidence is overwhelming: American highereducation should pay more attention to the quality of undergraduatec.c.:ucation. Where did it, despite all the mechanisms, go wrong? How can itbe, with the oversights of accreditation and program review, that qualitywas undermined?3532 The conclusion can only be that the oversight has not prevented si decline Inquality. The methods used are primarily procedural end quantitativa. Theyinclude virtually no real critique or threat to institutions. Ultimately, collegesare policing themselves. The top institutions do not engage in strongself-criticism, and the less-powerful institutions are not able to offercriticisms about those that are superior in the hierarchy.Accreditation is nothing more than a strategy to help out the weakest; it isnot a strategy to continue renewing \"the membership of the club.\" Theaccrediting agencies look primarily at the fulfillment of the institutionalmission, so in the end the institutions themselves define how they will beexamined.Contrary to the opinion in Europe about higher education in the UnitedStates, we don't have mechanisms that keep universities attentive toundergraduate students. The existing methods should be improved. Aproblem is that there is no accrediting body specifically for undergraduateeducation. The professional bodies oversee only one pocket; the regionalaccreditation office should take on the responsibility. They are in theposition to renew the undergraduate education as no other agency. Slowlyand surely things are changing. It is hoped that the discussion of qualitynow being re-emphasized will enhance the oversight of the quality ofundergraduate education.Kesently, the notions on quality are minly based on faculty reputation. Theaverage person has no knowledge of teaching quality. The plethora ofcollege guides give some hints, but the differences are not convincing.There might come a time when students and parents will becomeincreasingly sophisticated and demanding more information about thenature of the quality. The push for better evalumion criteria will emerge.This task is the primary one of accrediting agencies. They should developcriteria to be measured. It is hard to believe that a self-policing group will beable to manage the politics of that without outside pressures. This veryissue is at this moment being considered for an extensive study at Carnegie,similar to the study that led to the publication of \"College.\"POLMCAL AGENDAThe number one issue is quality of undergraduate education, which isrelated to a number of issues like student i:fe, attention for teaching, thereward for teaching parformnce, and the ethical debate over curriculum.Number two, closely connected to iie first issue, remains the question ofleadership. Can we find effective leaders for the managerial questions of the The issue of resources is, and will be, on the agenda. The expected declineof students will, especially for the very selective issues in the private sector,te a challenge: inAltutions might have to compromise tuition incometirough less selecilvity.The issue of auto, amy is nut, at this point, in the mainstream of thediscourse.CARNEGIE1 his summer the report on \"Scholarship Reconsidered\" will be completed.It will attempt to broadun the definition of the faculty role and establish et ewcategeries bv whkt faculty assignments might be made and performanceevaluated. In the co rent debate about quality, the research-oriented rewardsystem is obsolete lor ensuring better teaching, more counselling. Facultynow end up threatening thair own profeusion by stepping out of theresearch pattern. The absolute switch-point on the quality of undergraduateeducation resides at the issues of what it means to be a scholar and what anequitable reward eystem should be. 3 633 STATE INVOLVEMENTIt is hard to predict whether state involvement will decrease or increase. Ihave been impressed at how quickly climates change and surprised alongthe way as the moods have shifted on campus and off. The direction,however, will probably toward more state intervention in the are of fiscalrequirements. Perhaps this could even reflect the issue if colleges areperforming well qualitatively. The pressure to improve Is coming and willcome from outside. Some states have imposed mandated testing, requiringinstitutions to demonstrate that students are, in fact, well educated. Thisshould be judged critically because it borders on questions of integrity. Ifstates introduce standardized tests, then states determine what studentsshould learnl t1 \"I 34 INTERVIEW WITH DR ROGER GEIGER CENTER FOR ThE STUDY OF HIGHER EDUCATIONPENN STATE UNIVERSITYUNIVERSITY PARK, PENNSYLVANIA MAY 31. 1990.Intervlow summary 08 HISTORYMuch of my time spent in the study of US higher education is dedicated to ahistorical analysis of the da elopment of research universities in the 20thcentury which led to the publication of a first volume in 1986. The nextvolume will be published in 1991.The postwar period for all higher education can be divided into differentperiods. The most basic division would be: a1945-19751975-presentThe period of 1945 to 1975 was a period of rapid expansion of the system:expansion of research during the 60s and tremendous growth of access upto 1975, especially through the community colleges during the last 5-10years.Halfway through the seventies, the fast growth in terms of financialpriorities slowed down. The \"steady state\" period began. Except In some ofthe late blooming states\", higher education has not been a subject ofmajor public investment since the middle of the seventies. Higher educationhas lost its priority position in society and has moved down to the status ofjust another state expenditure.A moderate growth rate for research expenditure was secured by theincrease of federal support for research. Adjusted for inflation over theperiod 1975-1987, the increase in total university spending on research wasaround 58%.Federal support for priorities other than research has been reducedseverely. Money for student aid has decreased, and the level of assistancefor Infrastructure funding (buildings, equipment) has been cur sharplycompared with the 1960s.The result of this reduction in the levels of government funding has been anincreasing privatization of higher education. Institutions nave increasinglyturned to private sources. A few examples:First is the rise of tuition costs. The increase of costs over the last decadehas been significant. This has been partly compensated for by an Increase infederal student aid, but only for the students coming from the lowestincome groups. By assisting the \"poorer students\" you can charge more tothe wealthy students who have really supported tuition rises.Second, the voluntary support through tax-deductible gifts has becomemore and more important. Massive campaigns are dasigned tc increase theinstitutional budget. A campaign recently completed at Penn State resultedin $350.000.000; Ohio State, an institution comparable to Penn State, raised$400.1100.000. Fun raising has always been a strong tradition in privaichigher education, but has become much more important now in publichigher education. 335 Third, research support form industry has roughly doubled over the last tenyears as a percentage of total research volume. The strategy to build privatesupport for public institutions has been successful, compensating for muchof the decrease in state contributions. However, the smaller, regional,comprehensive col!eges have been less successful in raising funds fromprivate sources. The stagflation of public funds hurt these institutions most.The most important question now is: how long can we keep increasingprivate contributions? To be more exact: how much more can we chargestudents, and how much more can we expect from private funds? What isthe limit? The relatively slow increase in tuition at the most expensiveprivate institutions in Os last few years can be partly explained by that limit.To be able to attract the students they want, they must plough back moreand more money to student 'id.On the national level, there is consensus on tna need for an int (ease infederal support for research, but no one knows how tilt- nation can affordthis without fv,cing the politically sensitive issue of raising taxes.Assessing the dependency on public funds at this moment, it appears thatthe reverse situation of the sixties has taken over. In the sixties there wasexcessive dependence on government for funding. Institutions could avoidinteraction with othei parts of society. The approach is now more pluralisticin funding and outlook, and has shifted to a growing dependence on privatemoney. Until now, this approach has n n had deleterious consequences,mainly becius, the organization of the university has usually beendecentralized Into separate units. So only parts of the universities aredependant on private funds, and those are the parts that interact withexternal group extensively.PRIORITIES IN HIGHER EDUCATIONOver the years, priorities in higher education have shifted several times. Thependulum has swung between research and teaching. In the sixties,research was over-emphasized, while in the seventies the issue of accessand egalitarianism was high on the political agenda. In the eighties,resealch came back into the spotlight and is again a strong institutionalpriority.However, it is interesting to see that the total volume of research performedat the top ten institutions has been declining since the 1950s. Theseinstitutions are slightlybut consisontlylosing market share year afteryear. More and more nther institutions compete with great success in themarket. 'The attention given to research has, in terms of academic careers,bean a stimulus to increase the volume of private research. Smalluniversities can now become specialists in well defined areas, and the oldelite institutions (Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Columbia, Princeton, Michigan,Wisconsin, California and later MIT Cal Tech and Stanford) can notmonopolize all disciplines.INNOVATIONMost influential for innovation within the department areaautonomyleadersh ipincentivescompetition within institutions, between institutions, and betweenstatesCompetition is a very powerful motivator. Universities are not trying to puttheir competitors out of business; rather, they are in competition forprestige. Institutions at the very highest level keep extensive sources ofinformation on what other institutions are doing: If they are losing graduatestudents, how much are other institutions supporting their graduatestudents, how much support other institutions get from various sources,what are the salary levels of faculty. 3 ;136 Universities compete in different markets. Harvard is competing withBerkeley for graduate students. Harvard is competing for undergraduatestudents with other elite undergraduate institutions like Amherst andV. Il lam: in Massachusetts. Competition in research is based on othercriteb '4.Competition is a catalyst for change, creating new circumstances. It wasexpected that the seventies, the decade of anti-elitism, would causeexpensive, elite iiheral arts colleges to suffer great losses. But they adaptedand did not go oui!business. In the eighties, this form of educationbecame a highly valued consumer good again, and ti-dt:e institutionsflouesh once again.ROLE OF STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTThe Reagan administration tried to reduce the federal student aid program,but Congress restored most of the damage. Federal student aid is nowconsidered a permanent part of the system. If it were changed drastically, arevolt would be expected. Unfortunately, the proprietary schoolswhichconsume much of the Pell Grant moneyoften have a bad reputation and ahigh default rate. Good policy demands a different kind of system for thesehigh risk students. But these proprietary have a very strong political lobby.Furthermore, it is not expected that the federal government will investheavily in expansion of the Pell Grant system: the access problem has beensolvedi Virtually everyone who is interested in post-secondary educationcan go to college. Given both the strength of the lobby of the proprietaryschools and the absence of a compelling social purpose to widen accessany further, no major changes are to be expected.The key to freedom for universities is discretionary income. They needmoney to be able to expand, attract better personnel, and set priorities. Thebetter the university, the more autonomous it is. Minimally requirementsare the authority to enlarge income and freedom of spending.The key to quality is autonomy and resources.PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATIONHalf of the institutions are private, and 22% of the students are registered ata private institution. This means that in most cases the private institutionsare smaller, more specialized. Their basic function be summarized by: more- better - different.Traditionally in the US, most public institutions were located in thecountryside, not in the cities. The private sector filled that gap with a largenumber of \"The University of ... !name the city)\". This explains the \"more\".The \"different\" is still focused on a number of institutions with a speoificbackgrounddenomination. for example.The most important, howe.r, is the \"better\", or to be more precise, thebetter and more expensive. The per-student costs are significantly higher atthe best liberal arts colleges and the best private universities, compared tothe public sector. Private institutions have set the national standard, creatinga positive effect on the development of state education to meet thesestandards.Over the years conditions have favored both private and public education. Inthe sixties and into the seventies the tide was clearly on the public side.Many of the private institutions were in serious difficulty. Many of themwere near the point of bankruptcy, and some went under. The question thenwas: can private higher education survive? They could survive because theyare private and independent. They could adjust to make ends meet:dismantle departments, lay of redundant faculty, etc. They came out of thisharsh period strongerthan the public institutions, which wore still heavilydependent on state funding. At the end of the seventies the states wereconfronted with declining revenues and rising deficits, and they had toreduce public spending, including that for public higher education. In the1980 the privates have, for now, generally been more prosperous than thGti () 37 public universities. Many private colleges however, remain in precariousshape. 4 '34 i L 38 SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHDR THORSTON E. MANNING CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL ON POSTSECONDARY ACCREDITATIONWASHINGTON DC, JUNE 6 1990Inters law summary 09INSTRUCTIVE EXPERIENCES ACCREDITATION PROCESSThe American zccreditation system has grown out of past and presentsocial and cultural conditions in the US. It is unlikely that an uncritical soil ofthe particularities of the system In to her countries with different conditionsand political circumstances will be successful.On the other hand, there are a number of general principals an proceduresthat have aPpeared over the years, that could be used effectively.The most basic principle of accreditation is the method of peer review. Thejudgement al to whether the 1 n stituti on or the program Is accredited, canonly be made by peers. This fundamental method is copied from theresearch tradition, and all the problems that are connected to that type ofjudgments which are valid for the accreditation. One of the dkadvantagesis, that the level of peer judgement, is not to rise higher than the mostdistinctive member of its team. Furthermore it reflects the general rundemonstrated by our history which shows that brilliant developments arerejected because they are ahead of their time.Before transporting the US system other countries, it is 1 m portant to nowthe weak sides, that have, after 75 years, not been solved. 1confidentialityStill i n discussion and not resolved is the question of confidentiality. Shouldthe judgments of the reviewing bodies be made available to the public?The current situation is, that normally only the final decision is published(accredited or not) and/or in some cases a short summary of the most1 m po rtant findings. The materials provided by the 1 nstitutions or programsare the responsibility and property of the 1 nstitutio n. The team-report is forthe benefit for the institutions which is different in the peer review traditionin research. Confidentiality in research is unthinkable when the researchpaper is published.It is my personal feeling that we could do much better, if there would bemore and automatic disclosure of substantial amount of information. Thereis movement, and it has been proposed several times, but it has not led toalteration of policy.Interesting detail is that the states have so-called \"freedom of informationlaws\", which will practically mako the information public availahle. 2type of judgementAn important issue and the subject of perpetual discussion in theaccreditation scene in the US, is the type of judgement. Should it be apass/fail decision or a ranking c.q. categorization (very poor to excellent).The present situation is passfiall. This is a historical development. Attemptsto change the system have never had any substantial support. The mainargument is the variety and differentiation in US higher education. A 39 ranking would require many sub-groups In order to get meaningfulcomparisons, or It would lead to invalid Judgments.If ranking is not possible or desired, a more elaborate categorizationremains an option. The present two categories (pass/fall) could be extendedto a larger number.Fnr the most part, accreditation in the US has been very successfulespecially on the institutional level. It has been criticized from various sides,but nobody can do without IThere are virtually no unaccredited institutions. To be eligible for federalgovernment funding accreditation is a condition since 1953. The question Is:\"is there really a judgement as to were the fall level comes if no one fails?\"The question often posed is: how is it possible that very mediocreinstitutions still pass the accreditation standards ? The answer is ;lithevarious clientele and missions institutions have served. Instituticins willtherefore show a considerable variation in programs and levels. At the backof this is the highly priced access in the US. Inevitably there are institutionsthat deal with students that are not accepted by other institutions. They willhave different in standards of quality compared to the top institutions.When accreditation started in 1913, there was one single set of reasonablyobjective standards. As time went by the list was extended in the twenties.In addition to the first list, different standards were developed for differentkinds of institutions (one for colleges and universities, one for two yearinstitutions and one for teaching-training institutions). One of theobservations at that time was, that there was not a single institution thatmet all the standards. Nevertheless, there was a general consensus thatmost of the institutional performalce was satisfactory. Obviously thestandards were, not the institutions. Although most of them were ratherformal the criteria itself could under circumstances indeed be meaningful,but the complete list and the interaction of the separate standards drew apeculiar pic:ure that could not be met by any of the institutions.Compensating circumstances (for instance a relatively small library kruioutstanding teaching staff) were too elaborate for the criteria: is vele either ayes or no response. It was expected that a more .dtic approach couldeliminate much of the side-effects of the criteria list. After a few test roundswith visits to the campus accompanied by information prepared by theinstitution. A visiting team consisted of independent experts who wereasked to categorize the institutions that they had visited. The judgments inthe test round showed a consistent pattern which lead to the first conclusionthat valid and reliable holistic judgement on the Institutional performance ispossible.The second conclusion was, that in response to the substantial variety ofinstitutions, a judgement on the institutions' performance must be made inthe light of the purpose of the individual institution. One could question\"the appropriateness of purpose\" of an institution. The latter question wasnot an object of consideration in the early days of the system. Today, it stillremains one of the unsolved issues in US accreditation. A related point ofdiscussion is quality. There have been major discussions on this issue andthere will debates on this question in the future. For the argument we'll usethe following de3cription: quality is a measure of how well the institutionfulfills its own appropriate purposes. There complains about the quality ofinstitutions in American higher education Indeed a substantial number ofUS institutions would probably not be labelled as higher education inEurope. But the purposes of these institutions is not, and can not be, toreach the standards of Harvard and Stanford. There purpose is different. Theargument is therefore not primarily an argument of quality, but it is anargument of purpoce. J40 STANDARDS AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF PURPOSEThe accrediting bodies set their own standar& which will be influenced bythe COPA-board guidelines before they get rec,gnIzed as an accreditationbody. The provisions to be recognized do not prescribe in detail what thestandards of the accrediting bodies should be. One of the importantprovisions invite accrediting bodies to 'use evaluative criteria andprocesses that judge the appropriateness of institutional program purposes,the adequacy of resources and organization to meet those purposes,educational outcomes which indicate those purposes are met and thereasonable assurance of continued meeting of those purposes'. The detailsare left to the bodies.The reason for the absence of detailed centrally formulated criteria andprocedures is partly historical because the accreditation started as anon-centralized activity.Furthermore it is based on the hyrthesis that in the programmatic areas,the qualified persons to make judgments are the people in the disciplines.Standards should therefore be developed by the practitioners in the fieldand those who are education future practitioners. In practice this leads to alarge variation of standards between the accrediting bodies.I have the opinion there should be a process of recognized accreditingbodies which should review the standards of the organizations with respectto the validity of the standards, evidence that the standards do notnecessarily Intrude upon reasonable autonomy of the institution, they aretechnically constructed in a proper way (for instance they are notambiguous). Furthermore, the discussion on the standards could be moreopen to debate and influence than it is now.The relationship between Institutional - program accreditation is looselycoupled. Theoretically, a program looses its eligibility for federal funding if itis not accredited. But in reality the institution as a whole is still accreditedand nothing really happen, because most of the federal money is channeledthrough students.ACCREDITATION AND STATE UCENSINGThere is no federal licensing, all educational responsibilities are reserved tothe states. Over the years there has grown a connection between programaccreditation and professional licensure. A good example is medicine. Thereis no juris diction in the US that will allow graduates of a non accreditedmedical prog..-am to attempt the licensing examination necessary for alicense to practice medicine. The situation applies In most places for thebar-exam too.The state examines a person who presents Itself for a licensure. If they passthe examination, they are licensed and they can practice medicine or law.The tradition Is, that the person takes the exam, not the Institution, it is notspecified in detail how this person should have been trained. Nevertheless,a prerequisite for admission to many of the state exams is that thegraduates come from an accredited program.A state can decide not to develop a state-examination but to recognizeanother examination (for instance a national examination). Again, medicineis a good example because most states use a national exam. In contrast isthe bar-examination. Only a few states use a national exams which isalways supplemented with a state examination because of the legislativeauthority of the states. The law schools are confronted with differentdemands from the national bar examination designed oy the American BarAssociation.There is, generally, only one accreditation body per program or Institution.In the past it was suggested that a competition between accreditationagencies for the same discipline could enhance the quality of accreditation.The COPA policy position is to discourage the establishment of more than 4 4 41 orie accreditation body for same tasks. Duplicating accrediting organizationswould confuse the public and students and will inevitably lead to ahierarchy is judgments. The one body will find itself superior over the other.This would not be helpful to the public.Still in the field of program accreditation a few examples of competingorganizations exist. In the field of nursing there were two organizations.Currently there are two organizations in the field of chiropractic. The latterexample is the result of a dispute between two visions on what achiropractictioner should be able to do:abe able to diagnose diseases which cannot be subject tochiropractical treatment, so that the patient can be referred toother health providence;bthere is no need for that ability.Both groups have differences of opinion on standards.Besides these cases, it is not likaly that a lot of competing organizations willbe founded. It is not a lucrative business. The visitors are not paid except fortheir expenses and perform this task as a professional obligation. To be ableto establish an organization implies substantial support within theprofession and v''' 4in the educational institutions.COPA receives a number of infumation requests per year from people thatstate that \"an accreditation body for their profession is absolutelyessential\". After studying what is involved the interest fades rapidly. That iswhy there are not accreditation bodies in all disciplines.The majority of disciplin.. , that have accrediting bodies are health-relatedprofessions and other licensed professions. For other disciplines with noaccrediting bodies, the only type of accrediting is the institutionalaccreditation.INSTITU110NAL AUTONOMY AND ACCREDITATIONThis is a continuous place of tension, sometimes drawing more attentionthan in other times. At this moment there is not an intrusive mode.Mandated testing is loosing grounds. Fortunately the attention for outcomesof institutions is rising, and that is of vital importance. The answer to thequestion if accreditation is a threat to academic freedom results innumerous opinions. University administrators are more inclined towardsstandards related to organization or resources. They see those standards asan intrusion into the management of their own institution.On the disciplinary level the standards are reasonably accepted becausethey have been put together by experts in the field after some discussionand consultation. They are revised in reasonable periods, so that they keeppace with the current trends which is more or less a guarantee that they cannot be to far behind or to far ahead.Naturally standards are criticized for either inhibiting new developments orbeing to innovative.MINIMUM LEVELTheir is indeed a minimum standard which is market by the pass/faildecision. Among institutions a substantial variation in quality of theperformance occurs. That differentiation is not made visible in a pass/failjudgement system.FUTURE ACCREDITATION AGENDAExpected issues that will or will continue to be on the agenda: 4 5 42 1Conlicbmtlality and disclosure of Information.It Is expected to shift in the direction of more disclosure of information. Onthe level of institutional accreditation, the regional bodies use variousmethods to inform institutions of the visiting team's findings. Still the publicis not infurmed. lt would be advisable to publish a useful summarydocument for the public. 2for profit InstitutionsA rethinking of the way in which accrediting agencies deal with the \"forprofit Institutions\". Accreditation in these fields is very young, around 15years. The model was patterned after the regular accreditation bodies, butthe current experience now has led us to the conclusion that this field isdifferent and might require a distinct procedure of accreditation.3H.E. abroadThe accreditation of branch campuses of US institutions abroad is notarranged in a satisfactory way which will have to be resolved In the nearfuture. 4Specificity and generalityProgrammatic accreditation should remain assertive to maintain the rightbalance between specificity and generality which is one of the important,but eternal, debates. 5Institutional accreditationThe procedures of the institutional accreditation need permanent attention.If the standards are very specific, it will not be necessary to have highlyqualified visitors on the teams. But is the standards are general, the level ofprofessional expertise should be much higher. HISTORICAL NOTESJust before the turn of the century, the first accreditation was in veterinarymedicine, followed by allopathic medicine. The latter was the result of theactivities of the American Medical Association. They started to publish a listof medical schools ranked on the basis of the percentage of students whopassed the medical examinations in the various states. Simultaneously theAssociation of American Medical Colleges started a program in whichvisiting teams were sent out to institutions that asked for assistance incurriculum and procedure revision.Shortly after that, the two initiatives collaborated. The ranking continuedand so did the consultancy services.Institutional accreditation was introduced later. Three reasons for theestablishment of institutional accreditation. 1German requestGerman universities asked the Association of American Universities forassistance in identifying those institutions who's graduates were preparedfor graduate study at the German universities, because too many studentshad come unprepared. The Association responded by drawing up a list ofinstitutions whose graduates were sufficiently prepared for enteringgraduate studies here or abroad. 2Bureau of Education's first staff memberThe federal government appointed the first full time staff member in whatwas then called \"the Bureau of Education\" assigned for higher education.The staff member collected data in order to be able to present a ranking ofinstitutions. The draft results of that ranking were distributed for comments.Some of the college presidents who did not get a high position on the listpetitioned the president of the USA (Taff) not to print the list. President Taffdecided that it was political unfeasible, so the list was not printed. In 1912when Wilson was elected president the Bureau asked again for thepublication, but this president also refused. The American Association ofUniversities approached this staff member to devise a list tor them, and thelist was finally published under their responsibility.,1 43 3Carnegie Foundation pension whamsAndrew Carnegie made a fortune in steel and established the CarnegieFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching which was establishedoriginally to provide pensions for college faculty members. The firstproblem was the selection of institutions that would be eligible for thescheme. They set up a list according to a number of criteria. 44 SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHDR PATRICIA SMITH AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATIONWASHINGTON DC, JUNE 5 1990.Interview summery 10 CAPITOL HILLThe Americr:ri Council on Education is a multi purpose organization and oneof the important gcals is influencing the political process in the House ofRepresentatives and the Senate (In Washington jargon: Capitol Hill). OnCapitol Hill the federal (higher) education policy is shaped by the bits andpieces that are not left to the states. Thesa pieces however been haveinfluential in the history of the US higher education: tie land-grant acts of1862 end 1890, the serviceman's readjustment Act of 1944, the federallegislation on student loans and (invite and the distribution of reseal-11hmoney. Besides that, the tax-policy that sets the framework fortax-deductibility of private contributions to institutions of higher learning isdecided on Cwitol Hill. This often overlooked, influential feature ofAmerican higher education is decided by the Senate Tax-writingCommittees, Nhich are a part of the Committee of Finance. Privatecontributions have grown essential for American higher education andtax-deductibility is an important incentive for contributions. The Committeeresponsible for this issue in the House is the Ways and Means Committee. DECISION PROCEDLIRE FEDERAL BUDGETCongress decides upon the level of funding for student aid and researchthrough the National Science Foundation, the National institute of Healthand a number a other, smaller, agencies.The decision process is divided into three stages. The first stage is theproposal for the total volume of the budget. This proposal comes form the(now: Bush) administration. Secondly, the Congress Budget Committeadecides how much money will be spend on the various issues, andeducation and research is one of them. The budget, being a block of money,is fragmented into the actual allocations on programs and funds, thirdly, bythe appropriation committee. That Committee decides how much money isspend for what, within the limits of the total budget.The involvement of tha American Council on Education is directed atinfluancing the political decision process. What the student aid and researchbudget is concerned, the council tries to get as much money allocated forthese purposes.POLITICAL LOBBYThe ACE is an organization representing a large number of organizationsand institutions. Much time in the ACE's work is used for internaldiscussions with its different mem;ler groups, to achieve a consensus onwhat issues should be put forward to in the lobbying process in for instancethe Congress. Given the variety of intarests represented in the ACE, theinternal decisions may take a long time, or sometimes lead to compromisesthat save both the coal and the goat.The lobbying proces requires personal contacts with the person(s) to beinfluenced. That Is the background of the great amount of attention pald inthe establishment and maintaining of personal contacts with members ofCongress and House, and especially with their specialized staff members 45 resulting good working relations. This implies that we socialize with them;make political contributions to the politicians re-election funds and treatthem well, like for instance inviting them as speakers on your meeting whenthey like visibility. These financial contributions are of vital importance.Around certain public issues \"political action committees\" are formed tocontribute to the (campaign) funds of polificians. Universities and theirpresidents have contributed very little to the politicians' funds. This is notwell understood by the politicians and in all openness, influential politicianson higher education issues like Congressman Cord (Michigan) and SenatorPell (Rhode island) complain about the lack of lolitical contributions. Othergroups in education, like thc roprietary schools, contribute generously tothe politicians, and enjoy a r uch better position.Besides social contacts and Joi itical contribution, personal presence whendecisions are taken is esser 'lel for an effective lobby. You have to aprv:.- atevery event on Capitol Hill that influences h.e. When the commissions aremaking up a bill and a lobbying party is not present, you don't haveinfluencet in the lobby jargon this is called \"making dealson the Hill\".The number of staff-members Involved in higher education in both theHouse and the Congress is between two and three hundred. Most influentialare the around 25 staff members of the Education and Labor Committee.PRESENT PRESIDENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIGHER EDUCATIONThe Bush-administration has set forward a number of policy goals and anumber of them are related to education however not specifically towardshigher education. Still, the confrontation policy that characterhed theReagan administration's attitude towards higher education did undergosome change. The climate is less harsh, but the financial problem have notbee,1 resolved.STUDENT AIDThe present system exists of two elements, a loan program (called after thesenator Stafford, the Stafford-loans) and a grant program (the Pell-grants).The loan program is an open en,: entitlement program, while the grantprogram is limited to a fixed budget. The grants are distributed to individualstudents, while the loans, Are an agreement between the federal governmentand the commercial banks that are distributing the loans. The Federalgovernment pays the banks in case of a payment default and for thesubsidized interest. Students pay an interest rate which is below the marketrate and furthermore students pay no interest on the loan while they are stillin college. The Federal government makes up the difference for the banks.The Stafford-loan program has, because of its entitlement-status grownmuch faster than the Pell-grant progrt m. As mentioned, the Pell-grant is asemi-entitlement. The legislative concept is a formula that can be -and hasbeen- adjusted when the budget is sxceeded. The budget has beenincreased, but it can not keep rki the pace with the increase of eligiblestudents.Indvidual students benefits have not improved the last few years. The factth at more and more people need loans, causes a growing imbalancebetween grants and loans. What an appropriate balance is, has been subjectof ditxussion over the years. The discussion has been dominated byfinancial arguments: it is cheaper to subsidize loans, than to spend moneyon grants, even when the default rate is increasing.The Reagan administration has tried in a number of ways to reduce thesharply increasing default-rate of students. One of the proposals was apunishment of institutions who's graduates (or drop-outs) show a record ofhigh default rates. The federal government managed to compute defaultrates per institution by tracking the bank-record of individual students.Students at those institutions should, according to the proposal, no longer 46 bi eligible to borrow. The proposals were, rtiveral times, rejected byCongress,the debate on possible restrictions still continues.Most of the four year colleges have a relatively limited default rate, and theystrongly opposed measures thee: might endanger their student enrollment.The schools that cause a sharp increase !() the default rate are theproprietery (mostly vocatiomi) coilegs.., They attract very poor minoritygroups with Inadequate educational background, that drop out or in the end,being unemoloyed, are not able to pay back their foam. Many of them\"disappear' into thd sub-culture of the US society, livirri in the streci a,without a social security official documente, unfindable forthe authorities.The present defai:\". late is now up to $ 2 billion. The Office of ManagementBudget however, accepts this as still being cheaper than grants. The total?overnment contribution to the $ 13 billion loans is now $ 4 billion fordefault, subsidized interest di. ing the study, and the costs of the enc.:noteto collect when defaulted.Nonetheless.:s Increasing default rate, the system is maint:Ined forprimarily two reasons. aIt is claimed that, however the default rate is high, thu xoprietaryschools provide at least some education to those groups in societythat otherwise would not be served, bk cause the regularpost-secondary educational sector ic not Ir .erested in them.The influence of the proprietary schools. It is inter3sting tothat the entrepreneurs of the proprietary schools have a lot ofpolitical influence by paying large political contributions.In reality, many of the students in the proprietary sector have littleknowledge were they get into. They enroll for instance in a 6 monthprogram, borrow $ 2600.00 and get a Pell-grant of $ 2400.00. Tuition ofthese private proprietary schools that promise a golden flows will be high,up to $...00-4000, while their curriculum does not provide any more thansome basic skills. The institutions have to Le accredited, other wise thestudent is not eligible for student aid. But the accrediting bodies are noguarantee that the institutions provide decent education. AccreditationLxlies are \"their own peopFe\" in beauty schools, bartender schools etc. Theinstitutions became a quite lucrative business, because the supply forgovernment supported loans is unlimited. Many of the students who detauitwere poorly qlifted when they started, did not receive vAluable educationduring their study and end up with debts. A defaulter is registered at creditbureaus, looses its possibilities 'o get cre lit while the Federal governmentwill chase them until the debts are pair+ ta the rest of tnelr lives.Straligely enough, the default problem is to some extend nothing more thana definition problem, caused by the inflexibility by the program. The currentdefinition of defaulters is arbitrary. When a student does not makepayments for and certain number of days it is considered to be default. ftera formal procedure, the government buys back the loan from the hank andwill try to get the money back. The present regulations do not allownegotiations n terms or payments. This rigidity is caused by the fact thatthere are two actors in the field: commercial banks and the federalgovernment. A single actor would offer more flexibility in terms of paybackschemes. Since it Is tin, government that will always have to ;guaranteerepayment, government might as well operate as the loaning istitution futurel Default can then become \"extended repay.nent\", amajor loss of funds and problems for defaulters. REAUTHORIZATIONIn two years the preser.t higher education legislation on student aid has .,obe reauthorized. In preparation for that, the House and the Senate, willorganize hearings and decide which issues will be in discussio- it is herd topredict what the chances for alternative schemes are because it is all 47 depending on the level of finances available. Most likely the volume of thepresent Peil- grant will be in discussion. But if there ars any resources toenlarge that figure depends on the polifcal will to \"manage a bill on thefloor\" that would Increase federal spending. Congressman Ford, a Michiganhigher education specialist, is one of the very few politicians to openly optfor the only way to do that a tax raise.AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONThe policy of affirmative action is embedded in the Civil Rights Act andformed through a 'ergs number of court decisions. In the present situation itis not considered allowable to have fixed goals in terms of quota of f.i.minority groups, but every organization is expected to contribute to thegeneral goals of the Civil Rights Act. Anyone who does not approve thepolicy implemented or proposed can go to Court. For higher education, theaffirmative action is the most influential for faculty positions, and studentenrollment. In order to avoid court intrusion, many institutions make anaffirmative action plan.Civil Right Act is currently under revision, and the outcome of thatdiscussion might be of influence to the present policy. 17 SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHDR TED MARCHESE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION IF HIGHER EDUCATIONWASHINGTON DC, JUNE 6 1990Intarvlow summary 11ASSESSMENT AND ACCOUNTABIUTYInformation about student achievement is a very important part of theevaluation of an institution's performance.There are a number of questions that states are asking on the issue ofstudent learning. 1What are the gains in student learning, associated with theexperience of the institution and referred to as the \"value addedconcept\". It is an intellectually appealing, but in a practical sensealmost unusable concept. 2What absolute level of academic achievement and application ofknowledge do the graduates exhibit? In the U.S. there is anelaborate apparatus licensing and certifying of students forprofessional practice. The dominant role in licensing is maintainedby the profession itself. The states have an oversight role tosafeguard the public interest by guaranteeing that the standardsare high enough and applied equitably.That issue today Is not much in question. Although there is muchcriticism on the general level of undergraduate education, theskills of accountants, chemists, engineers etc. are not questioned.Generally the idea is that we have good mechanisms in place toensure that no one gets a license who is not competent. 3Quality is a process of continuous improvement. Is the institutionbringing about better conditions than before? This type ofquestion gained the most attention now especially on the statelevel. State authorities might not necessarily have the opinion thatthe quality of higher educat ln is poor, but it could be improved.The states want the spirit of quality as a continued concern of theinstitutions. Institutions should demonstrate an attitude of thedesire to do better and the states want evidence of improvement.The evidence is crucial: states are willing to grant a substantialautonomy to the institutions as to what methods of assessmentthey vent to use as long as those methods are sufficientlyconvincing and they can be proved that they are accountable forthe choices.Assessment plays an important role in the communication between stategovernments and institutes of higher education. Especially in those stateswhere deregulation leads to a larger degree of institutional self-governance,as a quit pro quo the institutions do more reporting and accounting to thestate. In this respect Colorado was a state with a most interestingdevelopment. In New Jersey the attempt to diversify the existing collegeswas channeled through a number of stimulation grants for those institutionswho would be able to specialize in a particular aroa. 49 COMPETMONCompetition is absent in the European higher education setting. Thecompetition in the United States on the undergraduate level, on the basis oftheir relative contribution to student learning, is not very elaborate.However, other elements cause competition such as: program offerings,campus facilities, etc. Competition is influenced by student choice. If thelabor market shows a shortage of engineers, soon higher educationinstttutions will offer courses If the students show interest. Furthermorethere is a market of college guide books, and many of these referenceguides try to familiarize students with certain university characteristics. Thepublication of these books became a big industry and every year thenumber of guides increases. The influence of high school guidancecounselors as well as other reliable and unreliable information on theexperience of previous students is substantial.It is Important to notice that all the discussion and speculation oncompetition between institution and student preference, is strictly related tothe upper half of the students. For instance, many students from rural areaslow income groups and/or minorities with average or poor high schoolpreparation, will have as their possible choice one of the two nearestcommunity colleges. The market does not work for these students, they willnot be admitted to many of the institutions nor will they be able to afford thecosts of many of these institutions.The question is how to make the market work. The first problem is related tothe information available on quality. It is neariy always based on theInformation provided by the institution. It would be better to have a mixtureof information from external peers and institutional self-study. The mostrelevant information will come from a cross-Institutional analysis in whichrepresentatives visit a number of institutions. A weakness of theaccreditation procedures is the pass/failure system which has nocomparison base. The Idea supposes public availability of information,another weakness in accreditation.Assessment serves several purposes including providing information tofuture students. Assessment provides information for self-Improvement ofthe institutions, information for the government, information for personnelcareers and so forth. Since these purposes are often not overlapping,multiple sources of information should be used. Institutional sources ofinformation might Include Input by faculty members, by students,institutional researchers, employers comments and other records.The external forces that shape the system are peer review, market forces or(state) control. They effect research, graduate education, continuingeducation and extension function, etc. However, none of them applies withany particular force to undergraduate education. The market force toundergraduate learning is very slight. The quality of undergraduate learningis almost the only Issue in U.S. higher education that is not peer-reviewed.Accreditation can hardly serve a functlor in the strive for improvedinformation on the quality of undergraduate education. They work withsuboptimal methods:representatives visit one institutionthe results are secret to the publicreviewing an entire institution, as done by the regionalaccreditationMore or less reliable information on the quality of the institution should bemade publicly available. This will be the only way to Improve students'choice on the undergraduate level. College choice on the graduate level ismore developed. 50 FUTURE OF ASSESSMENT 1Enforcement to Institutions Unwileng to CooperateAssessment Is done by institutions with a great variety in methods, spiritand success. It can be expected that especially In those cases in whichinstitutions have not (yet) taken their responsibilities, state government willenforce the use of improved assessment methods. 2A Better Sots* of the Use of the InformationMost states have not yet developed a good use of the information availableand are still experimenting. This period of experimentation often leads torequests of more Information. The near future will hopefully show animproved use of the available data by the states in their political decisions. 3Impatience of StatesIn some states (ex: Tennessee), the slow progress in the application ofassessment leads to increasing government Intrusion. Not satisfied by thistempo, state are setting up regulations and guidelines. It is likely to happenat other places, if institutions do not take flrm initiatives. 4The PurposeAssessment of student learning is not a l'art pour l'art activity. It may in theshort run respond to a direct incentive of threat from state government, butits strength lies in the application of reliable evaluative data within theinstitution to perform better and serve its clientele more effective. 51 SUMMARY OF THE INTERVIEW WITHDR PATRICIA HUTCHINGS AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF HIGHER EDUCATIONWASHINGTON DC, JUNE 6 1990Interview summary 12DEVELOPMENT OF ASSESSMENTThe most difficult assessment issue over the last five ys fs has been thequestion of student performance. It gained much attention, and it was in anumber of states considered to be the missing piece in the control ofinstitutional effectiveness.But assessing student learning is not only a difficult and controversial issue,is only one piece out of a large set of concerns and methods related toinstitutional effectivenessThe state attention for student learning caused controversy, especially inthose cases in which people tried to make judgments about institutions'contribution to student learning as basis for policy decisions. Originallysome states introduced state wide standardized tests. Florida is the mostwell known example. Fortunately, a clear trend of the past time Is a removalfrom a reliance on standardized tests to other more multi- Instrumentalmethods. For example, South Dakota originally mandated that alldepartments and majors should assess value-added by using a commercialavailable standardized test in their field. That mandate was repealed for thereason that for many departments there were no adequate tests available.The mandate was replaced and a more open ended one was put in place.Nowadays there are surveys, assessment centers., simulations, focusgroups, interviews, comprehensive faculty designed exams etc. Recentlydeveloped are the student portfolio's in which the work of a student isassessed over a period of time to measure progress in learning or skills.These new methods developed from a desire to get a deeper and moreaccurate look behind that kind of learning. This portfolio should not be just agraduation snapshot, but information that can serve a diagnostic role whichlooks at the way students get to exit-points. This type of information can behelpful for a better understanding of student learning throughout theuniversity study. It can be summarized in the metaphor: \"a movie and notjust a snap shot\".CAMPUS INITIATIVESMuch of the \"inventions\" in the assessment field take place on theindividual campus level or in a collaboration set up between a number ofcampuses. For example a set of methods to assess general education hadbeen designed by a consortium of 20 institutions. In other cases, a numberof institutions of mutti-campus systems have jointly designed methods (forinstance at the Suny University, New York). The fact that the methods aredeveloped on campus has a number of advantages. They are appropriatefor the problems they were designed for, and they have local credibility andusefulness.ACCOCNTABIUTY TO THE CONSTITUENCIESIn practice a tension arises between the use of assessment for publicaccountability and Internal improvement. There aro a number of differentand conflicting views on the possibility of putting together one package formany different purposes. My personal opinion is, that generally the different 53 goals will require different methods that will have to be able to respond tothe desire to either improve the institution, or to be accountable to thepublic. A positive feature is the recent connection of these two goals by oneof the external constituencies. Recently collected data shows, that more andmore politicians are less interested in the type of Information that isprovided by a standarJized test (scores), but would rather see that aninstitution defines goals and publicly assesses their outcomes while payingattention to whether the goals are being met. A institution that us multiplemethods is likely to receive more public support for their efforts to beaccountable. It remains to be seen if this favorable attitude will be thecommon future standard. It could bo productive for both internal andexternal functions if this could ba achieved.An example of a multiple-method approach is the New Jersey Test ofGeneral intellectual Skills. It consists of 7 performance-based, standardized,but not multiple choice, tests. The purpose is to measure students' ability togather, interpret and communicate informat'on. The state will use the testresults for planning and funding. Although it might bo hard to imagine, thestate has announced that they will send back to the institution informationthat will be helpful to individual students and teachers.OTHER METHODS THAN TESTINGTennessee is very active in assessment and trying out different methods alltogether. As part of a funding scheme they require institutions to do alumnifollow ups, students satisfaction surveys and employer surveys. The moreprograms that an institution has \u00b0accredited\", the more chance theinstitution has of receiving additional funding. Peer review is part ofprogram review, but is generally not used on the initiative of a singleinstitution. The University of Virginia has woven program review intoassessment. Illinois is also trying to Include program review in assessment. MEDIOCRE INSTITUTIONSAlthough assessment in its many forms including accreditation has gainedinfluence over the last two decades, the US higher education scene is stliiconfronted with a considerable number of mediocre institutions. Thedifficulty begins with the diversity in definitions of quality and the mission ofserving many different constituencies. In the US everybody goes to collegelIt will be hard for the assessment movement to find an answer to thatproblem, without setting more or less central standards. The latter is in theUS higher education not considered to be a favorable proposal. EXPERIENCE WITH ASSESSMENTThe experience with assessment shows a diverse picture of approachesdirected to the variety of institutions. A number of relevant conclusions on amore aggregate level can be drawn.a.Assessment time-frames have a way of getting out of hand. Statemandates which call for assessment to be up running in half a year denymost of basic factsb.The right order is: identifying desired learning outcomes, establishingcriteria for assessing which means heavy Investment in faculty is requiredc.There is no point in proceeding without faculty support: it is faculty whowill be largely responsible for whether data lead to Improvementsd.Most faculty are not trained to think about outcomes beyond their ownprograms.This leads to a number of more or less concrete solutions forimplementation.Do have a clear sense of purpose and do communicate thatpurpose to the institution. Faculty need to know what assessmentwill and, perhaps more important, won't be used for* Do have a plan, but resist the impulse to overplan, with every stepin a five-year project spelled out in advance. Leave plans open and 5 G54 1flexible, to grow with facultyinterests, questions, concernandneeds.* Do seek facultyInvolvement early on* Don't begin by askingfaculty to approve every detail of acomprehensive assessment plan. Be modestl* Do let people airtheir queetions\" Do be careful aboutconlecting assessment to some aspects of thecontext like the connectionwith faculty evaluation andpromotion* Don't consider facultydevelopment a central and ongoing motive. For successful implementation a number of variables will have to be takeninto consideration before achoice can be made between the ice cubeimplementation strategy or the garden as Implementationmodels. The icecube-model has three stages: unfreeze, change and refreeze. The gardenmodel is more like the Chinese flourishing '000-flower approach. e.; \"1II / 55 INTERVIEW WITH DR DEREK BOK PRESIDENT OF HARVARD UNIVERSITYCAMBRIDGE (MAS), JUNE 16, 1990Interview summary 13 FACTORS FOR PRO- OR REGRESSIONImportant variables for the development of top higher education institutionsare: aMoneyIt takes increasing large sums of money to provide institutions of highquality.CompetitionIt is important in producing the very best institutions to be forced tocompete on all levels.Nevertheless competition can produce various forms of unethical orunfortunate behavior. The best example of that is intercollegiate athletics.Secondly, competition can produce duplication and unnecessary expense.Various forms of competition should exist and various types of excellence,appropriate to the missions of the institutions should be the motive. At leastthree major groups in the United States higher education system can bedistinguished, that serve a distinct role: the community colleges, the liberalarts colleges and the research universities. Competition should remainwithin these groups, and even within these groups numerous subdivisionsshould be made according to the main focus of institutions. Competition outof their circle is inefficient and duplicative and does not function as anincentive for institutionc. ;.o do better. Institutions without a researchfunction are now often trying to become a research university, while theycould serve a much better role as an excellent teaching institution.Competition is an important and positive force if motivated by the rightgoal. But if the competition is to win a race where you don not belonganyway, the effect WI be counter productive. This problem currently existsfor a substantial number of institutions.Freedom from detailed state regulationThe absence of detailed regulations is helpful to be able to foster localinitiative and minimize bureaucracy.TraditionA tradition of unrelenting commitment to high academic standards and totry to do away with obstacles which interfere with that is a required basicattitude for an elite Institution.Although the United States system naturally has its problems, with respectto the development of top institutions the conditions are favorable. It has nomonolithic control. The possibilities of raising money are positive andcompetition is very much alive.COMPETITION FOR STUDENTSHarvard competes on all levels, also on the undergraduate education leve.for students. The competition for the best students is between thetop-institutions which are private for the most part. Harvard loses very littlesenior faculty, most enjoy the wcrking conditions at Harvard. One of theconditions is the pleasure to work with a student body which is as good asany In tt..3 e.ountry. To be able to attract the best faculty, the best students 57 are a prerequisite. Competition for students Is based on what you have tooffer students. We can provide them good education and make sure that theeducation remains of high quality. We offer interesting extra- curricularactivities, good living conditions. Much attention is paid to the evaluation ofstudent opinions. Extra money is invested in the improvement of teachingprogrsms, extra curricular activities, restructuring of the undergraduateprogr7m and so forth. Over the last decade $200 million was spent for thispurpose. The competition for the best students is the motive behind theinvestments which secures the intrinsic reward of striving for the best. If there would be a shift in student attention, and students would not beanxious to go to Harvard anymore, then an Intense process of Institutionalself-examination would occur.QUALITY OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATIONThe competition on the level of undergraduate education doesn't worksufficiently because by the fact that there is no common sense nor reliableinformation on the quality of undergraduate education. We have not yetbeen able to produce methods to measure the quality of learning. It remainsa matter of considerable obscurity which Is not productive to thecompetition. Quality of education is not central in high school graduatesdecisions of where to go to college.If we would have better measures for assessing the ipuality of education, theamount of learning, the extent to which students process, etc.. competitioncould serve a more important role. Universities would be forced to take theirquality into consideration.The universities are at fault by not paying sufficient attention to theireducational programs and not devoting the same afford to research andinquiry about their quality of education that they devote to research. If wewould have the same attention for education we could speed up the processand considerably enhance competition for better institutioni.The quality on the lower end of the institutions needs significantimprovement The methods, such as, as accreditation and rate programreview, which are presently used to do not contribute to the improvement ofthese standards. Politically It has been very difficult for accreditation bodiesto impose sanctions. But a more Important reason Is that the United Stateshas taken the challenge of educating a larger proportion of citizens than anywhere else in the world. This requires a broad variety of standards. GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONThe influence of government in West-European countries on the highereducation system is not specifically directed to the curriculum of the contentof the curriculum but it is still influential on the system. Governments inWest-European exercise central control on faculty salaries and other meanswhich could enhance competition.U.S. institutions have better development conditions than their Europeancounterparts. In addition to the factors mentioned, two additionaladvantages should be noticed. 1Institutions in the U.S. have access to considerably more moneythan any European university especially in the private sector.Money plays a vital role in the competition to guard competingfaculty salaries, equipment, buildings, libraries, etc. 2The U,S. institutions work with the lingua franco of modernscience: English. This is the reason why the best universities in theU.S. will remain the best for at least another generation. U.S.institutions can \"buy\" their faculty all over the world. The U.K. isunable to take advantage of its abilities in this respect becausethey do not have enough money, and Mrs. Thatcher has a very 58 5 9 misguided view about higher education. Furthermore, they are notparticularly enterprising and looking for the right faculty, althoughthey should have a far more talented population than the U.S. TheU.K. universities reputations have gone down substantially theselast decades. For other countries it is far more difficult to attractforeign talent if they have to speak German or French, Japanese o-Dutch. At least 1/3 of Harvard's faculty in arts and sciences is born,reared and educated in foreign countries. ROLE OF FACULTYAs societies become more dependant on science, new discoveries expertise,highly trained people, faculty are more and more in de- ,,nd in society.Consulting often facilitates the transmission of basic scientific knowledgeand is also a positive feedback mechanism from the outside world that canhelp reformulate scientific problems. How much time can a faculty memberspend on that? Society is making more demands on the faculty. Moderncommunication and transportation methods make It possIe to respondmore effectively to those demands. This creates pressure on theuniversities. On tne counter side to, in many parts of society the notion ofabsence of faculty is often Interpreted as non-producing and lazy behavior.ACCOUNTABILITYAn I m porta nt in d icator for accountability of private institutions areaccountable to students and faculty is the market. For public institutions thesituation Is different. Because they depend more on state contributions. It Isdifficult for states to judge if the institution produces value for money.States have difficulty to assess the quality of the institutions and have to useunelaborated statistical methods as attrition rate and other crude indexes.However, a single answer for the accountability question is not available forthe public nor for the private institutions. Accountability can only bemeasured using various forms ranging from outside visitations to studentpolls and competition for students. Is It necessary to have betterunderstanding and measures on these issues otherwise or the discussionwill remain fruitless. Institutions themselves could do a lot to Improve self-evaluation. One method, unfortunately not often applied, is to ask studentswhat they think of their education. For example, at Harvard if the studentclass indicated that their education was less valuable than a studentpopulation did three years earlier, then this attitudinal change would be asignal for action.SOCIAL AND MORAL RESPONSIBIUTY OF UNIVERSITIESAn important and presently underestimated task for the future is to restoresocial and moral responsibility of universities. How do you bring about thatchange? The major force is funding. It is the responsibility of private andpublic sources to use their power and enforce development in this era.External funding agencies have always used their power to meet their ownneeds or agenda. Private sources spend their money on initiatives that theythink are worthwhile, so does the federal government by spending moremoney to one discipline than to another. Strengthening the social and moraldevelopment of institutions is a matter of redirecting priorities. One of theconcrete priorities should be to improve teacher education.Being influenced by the agencies that provide funds, is, one of the mostimportant forces to constructively influence higher education, as long asyou are not dependent on monolithic funding. But if one sot of factorsinfluence decisions that affect the institution's future, than the institutionloses Its critical responsibility to be able to say \"no\".In the US, the multiplicity of funds will prevent a monopoly of one fundingactor, Still, universities have not exercised all their potential freedom toraise money. Only the easily accessible sources have been explored, which t) 59 Is a form to outside will. The freedom of universities could be enhanced ifthe priorities of funding agencies influences institutional direction.POUT1CAL AGENDAThe first important issue for the future can be determined by answering thefollowing question. What can universities contribute to the improvement ofsociety ?Secondly, there is a concern that too many institutions in the US are tryingto excel in an appropriate mission by copying the model of the researchuniversities. Other standards and criteria for excellence and recopnitionmust be developed besides the present research oriented ones andnon-research institutions should be inspired to achieve a different set ofgoals.A third point is that a tradition of assessing and evaluating the quality andeffectiveness of teaching should be established. Competition should bemore directed to the quality of learning. Especially the quality of theeducation at the undergraduate level is a point of concern. The accreditationsystem has not worked particularly well as a guardian against poor quality.Too many institutions are accredited that in practice are not competing withanything. We should be able to motivate these institutions to do better andfind a way to improve the information on the quality of institutions andprograms to students. If more adequate measuring sticks could bedeveloped, the incentives could be directed in a ore precise way to qualityimprovement.The issues that attract the most attention in the popular debate are: thequality of undergraduate education, the loyalty of faculty to theirinstitutions, and the rising costs of tuition. The latter issue is overblown. EUROPEWhat could the message derived from the US experience, to the Europeancontinent approaching the year 1993 be? Most important is tointernationalize as much as possible In terms of language training, theencouragement of international student mobility and international research.Secondly, to study the attitudes of institutions towards their responsibilitiesfor students. A striking difference between the US and European institutionsof higher education in that respect is that the US universities show muchmore responsibility for the lives of students. Often in European institutionsthe student in not noticed as an individual in that nobody knows she/he isthere, nobody seems to care that he/she is there and nobody seems to carewhat she/he does. That Importance shows little active institutionalresponsibility to an important constituency: the students. 60 SUMMARY OF THEINTERVIEW WITHDR JOHN K. FOLGER VANDERBILT INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY STUDIESVANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE JUNE 13 1990Interview summary 14THE USE OF INCENTIVES FOR FUNDINGThe use of Incentives in the funding mechanism, has received a growing interest In the US higher education over the years. They can bedistinguished Into two categories, incentives within the allocation formula's, for Instance output funding, and Incentives which are tied to the budget, toachieve specific goals. The latter could lead to tension In the stategovernment regarding Institutional relationship and institutional autonomy. But as long as Issues of content of teaching and research are left to theproper authorities, the feculty, the use of incentives next to the formula, show a legitimate concern of the constituencies with regard to certainoutcomes of priorities. The growing concern of public authorities to assure value for the dollar is a force that inspires the authorities to take action.A few examples of the type of goals which states are striving for through the use of incentives:* increasing minority participation;* decrease of attrition rate;* improving the basic skills of students.The experiences with the use of Incentives have shown that the layer that isaddressed within the institution Is Important. If any of the above mentioned goals are to be reached, the incentives have to be directed at thedepartmental level rather than at the institutional level. Incentives shouldresult In effective adjustment of faculty behavior. Only the faculty Is able toeffectively increaee minority participation, decrease drop-out and increase teaching quality. Reaching the departmental level by the state touches thedelicate level of academic freedom. States rhostly have an unwrittenunderstanding that they will not go detailed into the decisions of researchand teaching. For other goals, other layers might have to be addressed.SUCCESS OF INCENTIVE FUNDINGOther funding incentives can only be effective when they are directed toaccepted goals. The example of the most successful incentive, underiinesthat. The most effective incentive has been the stimulation of matchingmoney for raising outside endowment. The goal is accepted in that institutions want to raise extra money anyway, and It is easy to stimulatethe institutIonal administration to do so.In reality however, legislators, governors, state boards want to stimulatemany other goals through Incentives that have little support on campus or are difficult to direct to one of the institutional layers.In some cases the effect of incentives can be enlarged by feedback of theresults. For instance in the case of the politically decided goal for improvedteaching by using an assessment system that provides Information oninstitutional quality. Potentially an objectve assessment system is verythreatening to institutions. It could provide information that makes clear that educational quality is not as good as pretended or advertized. This couldgo61 have serious consequences to the student enrollment, which Is againconnected to institutional funding.In a time in which the Improvement of undergraduate teaching is debated, itis ra pity that such an open assessment system does not yet exist. The onlyinformation that might be relevant is the accreditation-judgement. But thejudgement are a non-public affair.INCENTIVES WITHIN ME FORMULA'SThe establishment of incentive-funding besides the formuia funding raisesthe question why these incentives could not be build in the regularmechanisms. In order to understand the development of these fundingschemes, some information on recent development in the US allocationsystems might be helpful.In the beginning of the 1980s, when a sharp decline of students wasexpected and public funds were gning down, budget reductions were oftenproposed in the form of reductions across the board.This was not experienced as an elaborate way of doing business, andfurthermore it was no incentive to improve institutional rwsponsiveness.This led to the strengthening of output elements in the basic ailocationmechanisms. The problem was, however, that serving so many differentconstituencies in terms of quality standards makes it next to impossible todefine standnrds which are central to funding.Is it possible to buiid in more incentives into the original funding model?More and more states are introducing this method especially to controlspending from the states. In some states, Colorado for instance,bureaucracy in terms of limited freedom of spending, has been eliminatedand replaced with other measures that relate to outputs and were politicianshave confidence in which are not subject to excessive gaming. An outputmeasure should take into account that the finish-line for some selectiveinstitutions is much harder to reach, than in less selective colleges.TENNESSEE PROJECTTennessee has developed an incentive funding program to stimulatequality. In practice 5% of the total volume of the state grant for highereducation is allocated to the institutions on the basis of the institutionalscores on a number of pre-set categories of goals. Each of the goals isfragmented into a number of indicators. The indicators are weighted perinatitution and scored, up to a maximum of 100 %.The incentive fund is appropriated as a lump sum. The six main goals are: 1Increase the proportion of institutional programs that receivespecialized accreditation2Increase the level and gains that students show on ACT-Compscores3Improve the scores of seniors on licensing and other exams intheir major field4Increasing alumni satisfaction (alumni surveys)5Remove weaknesses revealed in their programs6Developing and piloting new assessment instruments.Especially the second goal, the ACT-Comp score, has been a controversialinstrument because It is a general skills oriented test which measures theability to think critically, to write a.s.o, while the undergraduate education isa more \"contents or knowledge\" oriented general education program.Furthermore the tests wore presented to a sample of students by theinstitutions. In practice this could lead to misinformation if an institution didnot draw a randomly chosen sampie or if the chosen students were notadequately motivated to do the test. Rules had to be set on this issue. Dueto this type and other development the guidelines for the different measuresexpanded from r o over 30 pages in a decade of time.Leadership within the institutions learned over times to work with thesystem and appreciate it especially because it has a clear influence on the 6 ,162 political leadership. And indeed there strong support on the central statelevel for the incentive feature In the tudget, largely because it satisfies theaccountability expectations of the legislature and the governor.The incentives in the Tennessee project are directeo co the institution. Theinstitutions are responsible for the top down distribution of the Incentives.Most persuasive internal measures to stimulate improvement within theinstitutions are not test scores (this test is not tasting the objective that Ithink is important) but peer-review. This implies that it is difficult to combinethe formative purposes for imam& improvement with the summativepurposes for external accJuntability. They don't necessarily fit teyjather:what is imprenive for accountability purposes, may not be helpful forinternal improvement, told what is liked for improvement may be of novalue In terms of accountability.According to a number of evaluation studkis surrounding the project, thesuccess has concentrated on the Improvement on the goals 1, 2 and 3. Butthere is little evidence to suggest that the incentives have ca.sed majorchanges !n the instructional programs of institutions.The bureaucratic cost of the Tennsssee program are a point ofconsideration, but the system creates acceptability and credibility howeveragainst !a substantial cost.THE MARKETThe functioning of the market for the undergraduate level is not very strong.Little relevant information is available, a large portion of the institutions Isnot accessible for the majority of students, and costs limit possible mobility,eithbr because of high tuition rates at private institutions or out-of-staterates in the public sector.These conditions make if difficult to have the market work in a adequate andfree way. However, it could be improved by channeling more moneythrough the students. That will have the overall effect of stimulating themarket. A voucher system in thi form of student- aid could be a stimulatingfactor. Minnesota, comparable in size and population with Tennessee, hasabout ten times as much state student aid availcble whie lu an importantfactor. The places were the effect of the market and the interest of theindividual consumer seems to be the least influential, is in p ib'ic institutionswhich have mere students that apply than they have to admit. Theyapparently have to cater particularly to the students and they tend to lessconcerned and sensitive. The private institutions, having a very high tuition,tend to be more attentive to the students.MINORITIESIt has been an on-going ;attempt co try to enhance minority participation inhigher education. A miety of approaches have been used includingfinancial incentives, One is the award of special minority scholarships ortuition waver. On the state level special programs are designed. Tennesseeis now exploring an incentive program v, hich will provide incentive funds toinstitutions in order to be able to attract n Dre minority students and to helpthem overcome deficiencies by providing them peer tutors. This will helpstudents both at the entrance level and could enhance the ret9.itioli ate.This type of help draws the basic question if it is the resporsraility of thecountry to provide just an opportunity, with an or,dn door policy vorsusenhancement programs which improve people's changes to get in and becuccessful in the study.The appointment of minority faculty is an ir ,portant stimulus ds they serveas a role model and images. '-z 63 INTERVIEW WITH DR ANN TOMLINSON BUREAU OF INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCHME UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPILAUREL/HATTIESBURG (MIS), JUNE 25, 1990.Into Mew summary 15 1.8What has been the development of Institutional research over thelast years.Old It develop to a scientific body of knowledge, or just a tool forInstitutional management. aThe purpose of Institutional Research Is to answer 3pecificquestions about institutions of higher education. It is appliedresearch which involves collecting both quantitative andqualitative data and evaluating this data within a context togenerate useful information for the management of universities.often the process results in problem indentification and cancontribute to decision-making grounded by fact, rather thanpersonal inclinations or preferences. While institutional researchcan enhance university management during poriods of studentsgrowth with adequate financial sesources the period of the 1980'sor the \"status-quo decade\" described by Clark Kerr, informationbecomes more critica1 juring times of budget cuts and freezes. Inaddition the public is demanding quality and accountability.Institutional survival will depend on management and decisionswhich are bafied on accurate Information about educationaloutcomes and the cost effectiveness of programs and services.The 1990's have begun with many states experiencing economicshortfalls at a time when universities are confronted with recordhigh enrollment.As technology in the 80's made pc's more available, sophisticated,and user-friendly the sheer amount of data collection hasproliferated, it is now possible and common to count thefrequency or quantify almost every aspect of university life. It ismy opinion that institutional research is moving from a morequantitative approach to a more qualitative or analytic informationbase. Will this trend have a positive impact on universitymanagement? In reality the value of institutional research is stilldependent on the wisdom and integrity of the user in whateverenvironment.Is institutional research a tool or scientific body of knowledge? It isdifficult tot separate institutional research from the institutionalresearcher. The importance of the information makes it necessaryfor some one to be responsible for understanding the data baseand communicating it into relevant information to the appropriateaudience. The Institutional researcher needs to understand theprinciples of good research, as well as have an appreciation andperspective of an academic community. As a faculty member withover ten years teaching experience, I have a personal blas thatsupport offices can be more \"supportive\" when the roles of thefaculty, students, and teaching are understood and experienced.The process of completing a dissertation centainly famhiarizes onewith the process of research. Without these perspectives, howeverthey are attained, perhaps it would be more difficult to identify 65 65 problems from the data analysis and make recommendationscentral to the mission of teaching, research, and service.2Which issues have attracted the most attention of institutionalresearch over the past decade (monitoring the puloications,presentations et uminars, etc). Is there a visible trend towardscertain Lewes and topics?The issue of enrollment management certainly dominated most of the lastdecade. Enrollment management developed largely from a concern ofmaintaining enrollments by marketing universities, personalized recruitmentpractices and retention efforts reflected in University 101 courses. Marketingpractices; such as, targeting student populations and matching individualeducational needs to specific institutions made is necessary for institutionalresearch offices to communicate institutional charcteristics meaningfully.Retention of students necessitates \" cohort\" tracking to analyze students'progess. Projecting enrollments became another important challenge.Predicting university environments has proven difficult because of theimpact of external factors of economy. employment, technology, politics,etc. The trend of enrollment management resulting in a more coordinatedsevices with a focus on the student which is of course our raison d'etre. 3What are the current issues of the institutional research agendaand what are the expected issues of the future.The current trend in higher education is on stratigic planning and outcomesassessment. Shrinking financial resources has produced a need forinstitutional strategic plans based on accurate information and costefficiency studies. Since strategic plans begin with baseline data, the plancan only be as good as the data.Measuring outcomes of the university experience is a result of a publicdemand for accountability. This trend will intensify as our society demandsa better educated and highly trained population to keep the U.S. competitivein the world market of today. Assessing student growth and developmentmay be the most important role for higher education because the resultscould really bring about dramatic educational reform. 4How influential is institutional research within the institutionsand how are the results of institutional research used in theinstitutional policy?Institutional research is only as effective as the staff within the institutionalresearch officio and elsewhere on campus. The influence of institutionalresearch is dependent to a great degree on communicating the data withsufficient detail and yet general enough so that tho public can understand.Communication should include a three-step comnarative analysis:ainterpretation of the data;implications within the specific context, andrecommendations which should be relevant to institutional policy. 5Does institutional research have effect or influence state highereducation policy (or other funding or governing bodies)?Yes. Institutional research provides the information to state governingbodies. It is the responsibility of institutional researchers to assure that thedata elements have been defined in a standard format which is comparableto peer institutions. The institutional research data which are reported tostate and federal funding agencies are the basis of funding formulas and toa large extent determine the amount of financial funding the institutionreceives. The data must be organized to meet the agency's specificrequirements or definitions. 66 6What I. the role of Institutional research In the process ofinstitutional performance assessment (program review, datacollection, accreditation, etc.).Performance assessment or institutional effectiveness has become anexpectation or requirement for most accrediting agencies. In general, theinformation required for this process Involves pre-test and post-test typedata. Student performance must be measured at the beginIng of thepostsecondary experience and again at graduation. The informationrequired for this process is complex, large cohorts of students must betracked by computer. Assessmont Is also comprehensive because it requiresa coordinated effort of many people from administrators, faculty, students,staff, etc. The second aspect of comprehensiveness is that the entirecurriculum which includes a great variety of programs must be assessed.The quantity of people and programs alone makes the volume ofinformation a massive endeavor.The role of institutional resarch at a minimal level might be defined asproviding data which meet the definitions of each accrecilting agency. It isimportant to recognize that each accrediting agency requires information Ina specific format which may of may not match institutional reports andrecords. For example, full-time equivalent students is determined byinstitutional or state formulas which may differ from the formulas used byeach accrediting agency. The accrediting agencies don't just useinstitutional data which is readily available. What this means is that theinstitutional researcher must regenerate the same information in differentformats for every accrediting agency. Every report begins with a specific setof definitions and formulas wh:P..h are probably unique In some way.A maximal level of involvement is in planning assessment projects andcoordinating campus efforts. Since axreditation Is particularly an Americanapproach in education, perhaps it is appropriate to t;utline the basicinstitutional self-study process dSfollows. 1Define and reaffirm institutional mission2Development and review of program goals and objectives3Determination of methodology:instrumentsdesignsampleprocedures.4Data Analysi,5Review of Results6Recommendation to strengthen weaknesses7Evaluation of recommendations, (Nichols, 1987).Realistically institutional researchers could be involved in all of the aspects.Professional accreditation is a process which provides and opportunity tobecome better acquainted with that particular program and faculty in thatarea. The process involves so much work and so many people that it isdefinitely a time of academic community. Institutional research issometimes discovered through the accreditation process. In other words ifinstitutional research did not exist before accreditation, it evolves in theprocess. 6 7 67 CONTRIBUTION *) BY DR CLARK KERR PRESIDENT EMERITUSTHE UNIVERSITY OF CAUFORNIA AT BERKELEYBERKELEY, CAUFORNIAMAY/JUNE 1990Interview summary 10* the scheduled interview could not take place on the agreed date.Dr Kerr gave a written reply to the basic questionnaire. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY BERKELEYDAVISIRVINELOS ANGELESRIVERSMESAN DIEGOSAN FRANCISCO CLARK KERRPRESIDENT EMERITUSSANTA 18, 1990 TO:Olaf C. mcDaniel FROM:Clark Kerr RE:Responses to Delphi research project interview questions I.Strong aspects of the U.S. higher education system are:(I) universal access(2) great diversity among institutions and programs(3) excellence of training and research at highest levels(4) autonomy of individual institutions. Weak aspects are:(1) the low rate of transfe from two-year community colleges to four-yearinstitutions(2) the decline of the importance of the Liberal Arts II (Carnegie Classification)institutions which have historically provided diversity in American highereducation(3) very high number of increase in centralization of public institutions inLosystems--about half of all institutions are within centralized systems. 68 69 Challenges are:(1) introduction of more underrepresented minorities into student bodies andfaculties without too great a decrease in quality and funding of academicactivity(2) the great need for more Ph.D.s to replace retiring faculty members totake care of small growth in student numbers(3) the replacement and renovation of physical plant, much of it built inthe 1960s and early 1970s. These groups are organized around grievancesof individual groups and appear to be inclined toward the quick use ofviolence (as here in Berkeley). 2.See the above comments. 3.The Federal government will continue general role of vision of student aidand particularly will be required to increase the amount of grants based onneed.The Federal government will also be required to change its R&Dprogram to put less emphasis on military programs and more on economicprograms to offset R&D programs in the universities. 4.I rate the performance of the states overall very good but view the currenttrend toward centralization by the states as counterproductive. 5.I rate the best quality assessments as being:(1) which institutions attract the best students(2) which institutions attract the best R&D support in competition withone another.For Europe, I would say the same. 6.1rate accessibility to hi&her education overall as excellent. Ibelieve the transfer rights could be improved in the U.S. significantlyand in Europe on a massive basis. 7.a.Yes b.To have a combination of intense competition among institutions and severalsources of funds for which they can compete c.The strongest innovative forces are: the changing student market, thechanging research agenda and r!- entrepreneurial administrp.tors. Themost conservative force is the iculty. 8.The main role of faculty is to control academic programs.The most important measures in personnel policy are internal peer reviewand an active national market for high-level talent. 9.The role of institutional mission statements is two-fold: (1) to give membersof the university community an opportunity to talk together about the futurethey would like to achieve; (2) to use for public relations purposes. Many,however, are so poorly developed and so self-serving that they are useless. 10.The most prestigious institutions are private among the Liberal Arts Icolleges (Carncgie Classification) but not in other classifications. Amongthe leading research universities, about one-third are private and two-thirdsare public.C;)70 If public institutions were to be reduced or abolished, the result would bechaos.If the private institutions were to be reduced or abolished, deteriorationwould occur in the private sector but also the public. 11.My comments are based on experiences as Chancellor of the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, President of the University of California (system),Chairman of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education and the CarnegieCouncil on Policy Studies in Higher Education, director of a series ofstudies on presidential leadership and governing boards for the Associationof Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, and Co-chair of theEducation Commission of the States Task Force on State Policy andIndependent Higher Education. 0-1 71 CONTRIBUTION *) BY DR ELAINE EL KHAWAS AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATIONWASHINGTON DC, MAY/JUNE 1990Interview summary 16* the scheduled interview could not take place on the agreed date.Dr El Khawas gave a written reply to the basic questionnaire. U.S. Pi her Education: Present and FutureU.S. higher education today is quite healthy if one judges it on itsinternal dynamism, willingness to confront problems and innovate andin its overall performance in teaching, research and public service.Compared to the educational systems in Western Europe, the mechanismsfor decision-making -- especially differences in who initiates changeand who sets broad policy direction -- are unusual, but the broadissues -- of providing quality education to a sizeable proportion ofthe population with diverse preparation and purposes, and withinfinancial constraints -- is much the same.The greatest strengths of American higher education include: *Strong, continuing demand for higher education, includinggrowing interest in practical, flexible programs (e.g.,master's degrees; community college courses; courses conductedwith business and industry). *Well-managed institutions, operating with considerable autonomybut also with vigorous forward-looking objectives. *Substantial support for higher education in the businesscommunity, anchored in the participation of business leaders oncollege and university boards as well as in a multitude ofuniversity-industry cooperative projects. *Increasing attention to outcomes, i.e., to student achievementand to other evidence of institutional effectiveness. U.S. colleges and universities have confronted a variety of seriousissues in the last decade or so, but have adopted an activist responseto those issues. Reform \"movements\" abound today, many focused on thecurriculum, others devoted to enhancing opportunities for racial andethnic minorities or to numerous other purposes. Colleges andunive-d.ties, feeling challenged by the threat of decreasingenrollment due to demographic change, have responded with diverseefforts tc strengthen their institutions. This process has resultedin a healthy increase in functional differentiation among Americaninstitutions, especially those offering four-year degrees; althoughfew mergers or formal changes in status have taken place, manyAmerican colleges and universities have developed particular\"specialities\" or \"niches\" in the broader academic market.Some now 7 73 pride themselves on being \"regional\" universities, working closelywith and serving the needs of their area's industries andmunicipalities. Some have adopted curricular distinctiveness,offering a special strength in international studies or in cooperativeeducation.Others offer a thoroughly computerized campus or weekendcolleges and other innovative mechanisms for delivering education.The system's weakness are serious ones, including: *Uneven levels of preparation and motivation among students; *Costs outpacing revenues on a long-term basis; *Substantial inertia regarding curriculum change; *A sharply competitive academic labor market for facultyemerging in the mid-1990s and lasting more than a decade.The most critical long-term issue facing U.S. higher education is thatof costs and productivity. Colleges and universities have worthygoals and are reasonably efficient in carrying them out, but the costsof doing so are rising more rapidly than sources of available revenue.The public purse is increasingly called upon to respond to other needs-- funding for elementary and secondary education; highways andbridges and other transportation needs; and an aging population -- sohigher education will be constrained in what resources it can receivefrom public sources. At the same time, much as the U.S. is celebratedfor its private fund-raising activities, many campuses recognize thatthey are already receiving the most that can be expected from privatesources and cannot depend on such fund-raising for any expandedfinancial role. 2.Distinctive Characteristics of U.S. Higher EducationExisting literature accurately portrays the most distinguishingcharacteristics of U.S. higher education as including: *institutional autonomy;*multiplicity of funding sources;*diversity in all aspects;*competition;*great accessibility.I would add two more: (1) flexibility of educational offerings,including many \"second chances\" and (2) a penchant for problem-solving.The flexibility is often missed in descriptions of the formalstructure of higher education. But \"second chance\" options andopportunities to change directions abound, including: an alternativehigh sr.,-1 credential; considerable lateral movement among types ofinstituc...uns; procedures for, and special programs to facilitate, lateentry into education by adults; allowances for interruption and laterresumption of studies; relatively easy changes among most academic 7 744. specializations; and systems for recognizing learning acquired innontraditional settings. The student who spends four years at oneuniversity, without interruption and studying for only one major fieldof specialization, may well be the exception rather than the rule inthe U.S. today.Thf:re's no claim that U.S. higher education has solved all of itsproblems, but it's not for want of trying. Ask any collegeadminstrator what's new on her or his camfrtis; look through the(typically bulging) weekly newspaper, The Chronicle of Hi herEducation.Task forces and committees are at work on mos collegecampuse ...looking into particular problems and invariably emerging witha list of recommendations. The number of national conferencesoffering expert advice on this and that academic issue are toonumerous for even the most stalwart traveler to attend. It's part ofthe mindset of most college administrators to do more than administertheir programs; they also will have an agenda, a pet project or issuethat they intend to work on during the next few weeks or months. 3.The Role of the Federal GovernmentAt this point in our history, the American federal government playstwo major roles in higher education: (1) it is the major source ofresearch funds and, in this capacity has far-reaching influence on thedirection and extent of basic and applied research conducted in theU.S.; and (2) it is the primary source of student financialassistance, distributed by national criteria of financial need andavailable to students without restrictions on what educationalinstitution they will attend.These two roles will continue, although some observers believe thatthe relative impact of the federal government on student financialassistance will continue to diminish. Certain states and manycolleges and universities themselves have responded with their ownforms of student financial assistance to meet a growing gap betweenstudent costs and what the federal programs will provide.It is worth noting that both of these federal roles involvedistribution of funds on objer iteria (although the researchreview mechanisms are sometimo .45!ruled) and the funds are directedto individual recipients (rese, .ivehLigators or students). Theuniversities and col)eges do n. v....ontrol over how they are spent,nor do the grants have any \"st -,Wr..tached\" in terms of broad policydirectives for the colleges anr .ivetities.It is indirect support,not direct support for higher edwotion.Small programs of direct support el.so exist, (e.g., to supportinnovative projects or international outreach). Two such fundingareas are likely to expand in the future (but not to the level ofsignificant nationwide influence): support for graduate fellowships,and funding to improve science instruction in elementary, secondary,and higher education. The student financial aid program willcontinue, probably cov,,ring a decreasing share of student costs.There has been some tendency to add restrictive institutional 7:1? 75 requirements to the student aid program, requirements that areannoying and add paperwork but that, as yet, don't representsubstantial intrusion into college operations; thus, collegesadministering federal financial aid programs now must have studentscertify that they have registered for military service and that theyare \"drug-free.\" 4.The State Government's RoleThe trend, clearly, is toward increased state involvement. This israther universally considered a bad development by college anduniversity administratots. They have legitimate complaints that stateagencies sometimes \"micro-manage\" by stipulating such small matters aswhere supplies are to bought or whether very small amounts of moneycan be transferred from one use to another. In other instances,college administrators can point to educational nonsense imposed uponthem by impatient legislators. For example, in Florida, there is theGordon rule, which mandates that all Florida college students mustwrite 10,000 words (or is it 8,000 words?) during their first twoyears in college.The reason for increased state involvement is often said to be a callfor accuun'ability, for a way to defend state public spending to thetaxpayer.That rationale is easily offered, perhaps because it is soeasily defended. But there's a broader view of events as well. Thereis a crisis of financing for higher education in the U.S. today, thatis a result of a collision between two strong forces: steadilyincreasing higher education costs (as colleges and universitiesattempt to meet rising expectations) and similarly rising costs forpublic spending on other sectors, especially elementary and secondaryeducation; needs for prisons, for better transportation and forup-to-date telecommunications and other infrastructure needs; and forservices to a increasingly sizeable aging population. There are notenough public funds to go around to pay for all of these differentneeds, yet the population has demonstrated, through several recentreferendum votes, that it does generally not want to spend more onpublic services. In this broader context, increased state involvementcan also be interpreted as a way for state officials to hold back thepace of spending increases for higher education. Increased statescrutiny and calls for greater productivity go along with a messagethat there will be a slower pace of funding increases.The most productive accommodation to this new reality -- for bothstates and institutions -- is based on a mutual recognition of whateach partner can do well. If productivity gains are needed, it willnot be achieved by a \"top-down\" mandate. The nature of the academicsystem is that changes have their best prospects when they aregeneratee by the faculty, especially a small number of reform,-minded faculty. A state agency should start from this reality andlimit its efforts to direct change with a strong hand; it can setgoals, and timetables for changes, but it also would do well to designincentives for the small groups of faculty who would welcome theopportunity to improve their institution's performance. Seed-moneyfor planning and trying out innovations would be appropriate and, 7 76 probably, well-spent. Mechanisms for hearing from (i.e reallylistening to) the faculty view of how education works wo.A:4 also beuseful, via workshops or forums attended by state officials andfaculty alike. The faculty are the ones who see the real operatingproblems in education; they are the ones \"on the factory floor\" andare most able to describe what changes are needed and what changeswould not work. 5.Quality AssessmentEfforts to introduce quality assessment have often reflected amultiplicity of purposes. Different techniques vary in their abilityto serve these various purposes, so an initial imperative for anyplanner or policymaker is to choose among the purposes that can beserved by quality assessment. Is the purpose to spur improvement?to identify unacceptably weak programs? to recognize and rewardexcellence?to develop a \"merit\" basis for allocating scarce funds?Two aspects of the experience in the U.S. provide useful perspective.First, the assessment/evaluation methods that have worked best arethose -- such as are found in accreditation and in the use of outsidevisiting committees -- that are based on a process and procedures thatcollege faculty and administrators have developed and in which theyactively participate. It is self-regulation, which is not easilytrusted by outsiders who wish for a system they can control anddirect.But the test is one of relative efficacy: in view of thehighly decentralized way in which education works, and the diversemeans by which education is accomplished at the postsecondary level,a self-regulatory, faculty-driven process is the best systemavailable, with the best prospect of correctly identifying problemsand guiding resources to address those problems. There are hazardsthat it is too \"soft\" a mechanism, too permissive and forgiving, butthese hazards can be offset with a sufficient degree of publicscrutiny about the process, the standards that are employed and theresults obtained. In this light, methods worthy of future attentioninclude the mechanisms of accreditation (bearing in mind that someaccrediting bodies have more demanding processes than others), as wellas similar procedures that focus on the use of outside experts toreview departmental programs and assessments developed by faculty inthose programs.A second perspective from the U.S. experience is that performanceindicators (including institutional rankings) have greater meaning andvalue at lower levels of operating reality and, conversely, offerextremely restricted value at high levels of aggregation. Highereducation is sufficiently diverse as an operation, and its studentssufficiently diverse today too, that broad indicators -- describing anentire system, a university, or even one department's students -- haveso many embedded sources of possible distortion that they do notwarrant use for any meaningful purpose. It's a worthy aim, to developa set of simple, useful indicators.In practice, developing a fairindicator and then, especially, accurately interpreting why there ischange in an indicator, is an extremely time-consuming, oftenimpossible task that takes time and energy away from more important 771 issues.When, instead, at the disaggregated level, departmentchairpersons are given the tools for developing their own department'sperformance indicators, such indicators can be extremely powerfultools for improvement and productivity gains. In such a setting, thedepartment chairperson is able to adapt the \"cold\" numbers to a realsetting, to understand what's behind the numbers and to relatespecific changes and events to changes in the indicators. If thedepartment chairperson cares about improving the performance of thedepartment, such indicators can be extremely effective. 6.Access in U.S. Higher Educationwide access to higher education stands as a core value in contemporaryAnerican life. It is an ideal, of course, and its achievement isflawed in many specific ways. Each failure, in human terms, is aserious shortcoming. In larger view, however, it is fair to say thatthe U.S. has achieved an enviable degree of access and, too, it hasmechanisms in place that ensure a high degree of access.The bulwark of access in American are public (state-supported)four-year colleges and universities. They offer good education thatis well-regarded in the wider economy. They offer this education atreasonable costs to students; tuition is charged at most of theseinstitutions, but tuition averages about $1,700 for two semesters ofstudy at public institutions. These institutions are numerous, andgenerally within \"commuting\" distance of most of the population.Together, they accounted for 66 percent of all baccalaureate degreesawarded, 59 percent of all master's degree, and 65 percent of alldoctorate degrees awarded in the U.S. in 1986-87.Another important element of access, mentioned earlier, Is theelaborate structure of \"second chances\" that are available. Distancelearning, and credit for experiential learning could be mentioned too,as well as college-level instruction via television or college-levelinstruction held in prisons. Today, we celebrate adults who receivecollege degrees late in life, and most adults who did not attendcollege earlier in their lives have realistic options available tothem if they wish to undertake college study later in life.An \"elite\" sector of higher education certainly exists in the U.S.but, despite the fact that it gets the lion's share of mediaattention, it accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of undergraduateenrollment.Important too, is the fact that academic merit is theprimary factor governing admission decisions to elite institutions andthese institutions spend a considerable amount of their own funds tohelp needy students attend their institutions. This does not denythat, for a student from very restricted life circumstances, it isextremely difficult to assemble the proper credentials to meritadmiss!on at these elite schools.Stated more broadly, the degree of access must be defined in somespecific manner. The most typical indicator is the percentage of ahigh-school leaving group that goes on for postsecondary study. Onthis statistic, the U.S. has a long and proud record. A more 7t; 78 restrictive indicator, one that is increasingly talked about bybusiness leaders, is the percentage of the population that has acollege degree. Here, too, the U.S. ranks well among industrializednations.Another, more compelling indicator might also be devised,although it is not readily available: the percentage of thepopulation that is able, because of a higher degree, to achievesubstantial social mobility in one generation. Is it rare or typicalthat a young person from limited social circumstances is able toobtain an educational credential that provides passage into asatisfying and economically successful life? I'd estimate that, onsuch a measure also, the U.S. would be considered to be achieving agood degree of access.Speaking more personally, I would not be content with the level ofsuccess that any of these measures would show.Instead, I wouldprefer to call attention to the many steps in the educational pipelinewhere the system currently fails the student from limitedcircumstances. We have a substantial unfinished agenda. 7.The Adaptiveness of American Colle es and UniversitiesAdaptiveness and responsiveness to new social demands are extremelyappropriate descriptive characteristics of American higher educationin recent decades. Since the end of World War II, colleges anduniversities have been confronted with -- and have respondedwell to -- the challenges of new populations, enormous enrollmentgrowth, changing technology, and demands for ever more relevanteducation.The characteristics that contribute to a responsive style are noteasily identified. Some contributing factors might include: *The flexibility that faculty have in how they use their time *A tradition of self-study and continual improvement of eachacademic department's program, which includes a jointdiscussion among all members of the department *A faculty ethic that prizes teaching excellence (an ethic thatmay be threatened today by a shift toward research andadministrative endeavours) *Direct and informal faculty contact with students, which offersthe faculty member affirmation of his/her rola as an educator(also a tradition that some feel has been threatened by largerclasses and a shift toward research) *Institutional funding and services that provide essentialsupport for departments and faculty so that they canconcentrate on the academic program *An abundance of small grant mechanisms, allowing individualfaculty or groups of faculty to \"get a start\" on a new projector an innovative teaching approach 7%11 *The existence of many voluntary associations that areianovation-minded and that offer expert advice and resourcematerials that can be adapted to institutional circumstancesThe importance of the latter -- the many voluntary associations thatcall meetings, circulate newsletters, and maintain memaer networks --should not be underestimated. And note, too, that these associationsare generally absent from the higher education setting in othercountries.At their best, they play a critical role as a catalyst forchange.They enable groups of faculty at one college to hear abouthow other colleges have approacned a particular problem; and provide arewArd structure for innovation by offering a platform for faculty todescribe improvements they have made in their educational offerings,whether by presenting papers at meetings or through publishednewsletters and journels.8. Institutional missionln the U.S., institutional mission statements are, in most instances,documents generated 131 planners at a specific university or college.They are affirmed and ratified by the university's governing board,but in essence they represent statements by each institution'sleaders about their aims and aspirations for the institution.Although these types of statements are often ignored or given lipservice, when used well, they can be effective in expreseing auniversity leader's visions for the university, the directions thathe/she would like it to take, and the tempo of change that isnecessary.Mission statements can also be developed by state legislatures andstate agencies. This is especially done to set boundaries between oneuniversity and another or between one type of institution and another.One key example of the \"boundary-setting\" role of missicn statementsis found in the master plan adopted by the state of California. Itclearly demarcates the segment of the student population that is to beserved by each of the different eectors of public higher education inCalifornia and explicitly allocees the doctoral training to only onesector.Another clear boundary-setting mission stetement is thatgiven to community colleges in the U.S.; they may be responsivecommunity educational organizaticns in the broadest sense, but theirmandate is limited to offering academic programs for only the firsttwo years after high school. 9.The Role of the Public SectorThe public sector plays a vital role in American higher education. Asnoted above, it accounts for about two-thirds of all baccalaureate andhigher degrees conferred by American colleges and universities.Community colleges in the U.S., which are also public, provide a richarray of occupational, technical, and general education programs thatserve both their graduates and American business and industry verywell. 7 80 It is not accurate to say that most prestigious institutions areprivate.The University of Michigan, the University of California atLos Angeles and the University of California at Berkeley areindisputably world-class institutions. Other strong stateuniversities can also be named. In science especially, publicuniversities have an outstanding, and prestigious, record ofaccomplishment.Prestigious, private universities in America are long-established andwell-known internationally. And they protect their prestigecarefully, in part by choosing to excel on a limited range of possibleaccomplishments. They are a source of pride to Americans, but theircontribution is restricted and in no way can be compared to thedifferent, but still prestigious accomplishments of some of America'sstate-sponsored universities. annex 1additional notes Ed Hines DELPHI RESEARCH PROJECT -- OUTLINE OF RESPONSESPrepared for Olaf C.

c.Accountability mechanisms & efforts, by definition, will erode inst. autonomy,or they will be perceived as doing so.Moves to increase autonomy will, virtually always, cause tension & conflict.A structure needs to be put into place to identify these natural tensions,and provide for their resolution.Additionally, key leaders need to be sensitive, willing, & proactive.(See Newman's book on CHOOSING QUALIT Y, esp. aspiration, tradition,leadership, + the case studies) 5.Quality assessment:Foremost, decide on the purpose for quality assessment.Assessment for threshold performance is vastly different from assessmentfor either quality improvement or quality assurance.Both are valid.,n general, multiple indicators are better than any single indicator.Student evaluations are important, but so, too, are peer/superior evaluations.Additionally, evaluation can encompass productivity measures.E.g. evaluation of a research professor should include assessment of his/herresearch and scholarly productivity.evaluation of a teaching professor should include but not be limited toevaluations of teaching performance by students. 6.Accessibility of U.S. higher educationAre the most attractive institutions = to the most prestigious institutions?The most prestigious institutions tend to be more expensive to the student,more productive in researchand grantsmanship, and more selective.Accessibility is greatest in community colleges and non-selective four-yearcolleges (bath public and private).Accessibility is least in highly selective private liberal arts colleges and inresearch universities (public and private)In my view, the US higher educational system is highly accessible tovirtuallyeveryone who wishes tostudy there.Note, however, that selectedacademic programs anywhere and highly selective institutions tend to bequite INaccessible because of rigorous and demanding standards. 7.Institutional behavior: a.The adaptability and responsiveness are localized in some programs andin some institutions.Hoewever, in general community colleges and innovativeor experimentalliberal arts colleges tend to be the most a.,:aptive and responsive to change and to new ideas. Some academic programs and indeed some institutions are not adaptive and responsive at all. See Kerr, THE USES OF THE UNIVERSITY, new edition.b-c.Issues et al. which contribute to adaptability and responsiveness:Whether or not the campus mission is to be creative and innovative.E.g. community colleges tend to be institutionally innovative,and research universities tend not to be institutionally orprogrammatically innovative. Research universities, however,may b I highly supportive of innovation by professors who havefunded research projects and strong scholarly records.Whether or not the institution is oriented to the student as consumer. Whether or not the institution is oriented to producing research andscholarship.he strength of an entrepreneurialship attitude on campus.The strength of the service mission on campus. 8.The role of Vie faculty:To create, produce, reproduce, & disseminate knowledge.The basic missions of the higher educational institution comes into focus, here:teaching, research, service. More accurately, teaching- undergraduate v. graduate; research- basic v. applied; service - internal v. external.Stimulating faculty: tie economic, academic, & symbolic rewards to that whichis used to stimulate faculty and to the results of such efforts. 9.Institution& nission statements are used to define roles, relate roles to existingand anticipated environments, and serve to rally internal and external audiencesaround the mission(s).Mission set agendas as much as define roles. 10.The public sector:\"Most oftheprestigiousinstitutionsareprivate.\"This statement, which is commonly heard, is misleading. Among liberal arts colleges, most of the prestigious colleges are private.Among research universities, there are both public andprivate institutions represented with a larger number of privates than publics.One of the distinguishing features of American higher education is the combinationof public and private institutions.Under conditions of excess capacity, the entire national \"system\" of highereducation would not suffer because of a reduction in the public sector. Under crnations of filled capacity, a reduction in the public sector might beassociated either with increased demand in the private sector or with less student access and opportunity generally.Present fiscal circumstances in the states lead me to believe that highereducation is not going to be able to be supported at the level that it was in the past.As a result, higher education is becoming more stratified withsome campuses being more successful at increasing revenue from non-tax sources.The future \"quality difference\" will be experienced more by these somewhatmore prosperous campuses, while less prosperous campuses, generally unable 86 to identify revenue-raising mechanisms and who must rely on traditional taxsources, will becurne ever more mediocre and less distinguished. A number ofthese \"mediocre\" campuses, in my judgment, should be closed and convertedinto other public purposes, such as prisons and retirement homes. 11.See enclosed vita.

Weak aspects are:(1) the low rate of transfer from two-year community colleges to four-yearinstitutions(2) the decline of the impoLtance of the Liberal Arts II (Carnegie Classification)institutions which have historically provided diversity in American highereducation (3) very high number of increase in centralization of public institutions intosystems--about half of all institutions are within centralized systems. Challenges are: (1) introduction of more underrepresented minorities into student bodic3 andfacul,:ies without too great a decrease in quality and funding of academicactivity (2) the great need for more Ph.D.s to replace retiring faculty members tohake care of small growth in student numbers (3) the replacement and renovation of physical plant, much of it built inthe 1960s and early 1970s.

Themost conservative force is the faculty. 8.The main role of faculty is to control academic programs.The most important measures in personnel policy are internal peer revtewand an active national market for high-level talent. 9.ihe role of institutional mission statements is two-fold: (1) to give members e.'.7the university community an opportunity to talk together about the futurethey would like to achieve; (2) to use for publie relations purposes. Many,however, are so poorly developed and so self-serving that they are useless. 10.The most prestigious institutions are private among the Liberal Arts I.colleges (Carnegie Classification) but not in other classifications. Amongthe leading research universities, about one-third are private and two-thirdsare public.If public institutions were to be reduced or abolished, the result would bechaos.If the private/institutions were be Ledueed or abolished, deteriorationwould or.cur in the private sector but also the public. 11.My comments are based on experiences as ChanceLor of the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, Pre ident of the UnLversity of California (system),Chairman of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education and the CarnegieCouncil on Policy Studies in Higher Education, director of a series ifstudies on presidential leadership and governing boards for the Associationof Governing Boards of Universicies and Colleges, and Co-chair of theEducation Commission of the States Task Force on State Policy andIndependent Higher Education. 89 annex 2 list of questions, used as a basis for theinterviews 1The present situation and future expectations of the US higher education system.What are the strong and weak aspects of the system, and what are the challenges for the future? What is on the present political agenda? What issues are expected to be Important In the future?2The specific characteristics of higher education in the USA. The literature identifies certain characteristics of h.e. In the USA. Broadly these are seen as:institutional autonomy;*multiplicity of fundingsources;*diversity in all aspects;* competition;(peat accessibility.What do you see as the distinguishing characteristics of h.e. in the USA, compared, for instance, with the h.e. systems in Western Europe, and how do you view these characteristics?3Federal government's roleThe role of the federalgovernment In the USA is, regarding h.e, limited to the distribution of studentgrants and research funds. Is a tendency toward stronger involvement of the federal government to be expected in the future? What would beyour judgement of such change in the role of the federal government?4State government's roleThe States seem to be playing an increasingly important role especially in public h.e. Institutions. The literature shows how the calls for accountability has grow over the last fewyears. The cause of this increased focus on accountability is the desire to defend State public spending to the tax-payer.aWhat is your opinion of the present development of Stategovernment involvement in h.e. affairs?More generally speaking, how can the tension between theautonomy of the institutions on the one hand, mid the request for accountability (often executed in an autonomy threatening way) on the other, lead to a system which offers both institutions and State a workable atmosphere?What specific requests and methods for accountability might there be, that do not ernde the institutional autonomy, or causemushrooming unproductive bureaucracy?5Quality assessmentAn issue of growing importance in many Western-European countries is that of the quality assessment of teaching performance.aWhat are your experiences with the various types of qualityassessment in the USA (peer-review, accreditation, institutional self-assessment, qualitative and quantitative performance indicators, institutional rankings, etc.).Which methods would you recommend for further exploration In Europe and which methods would you advise against.6Accessibility of higher education In the USA It is often stated that the US higher education system is accessible toeveryone.
