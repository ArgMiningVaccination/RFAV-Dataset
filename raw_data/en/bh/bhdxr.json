The 2023-2024 Values and Vocations Fellowship The Values and Vocations Fellowship provides students the opportunity to explore the intersection of spirituality and social justice through community-based learning and a weekly integration seminar.

Fellows will volunteer 8 to 10 hours per week on a social justice project at a community organization. An additional two hours each week will be spent attending the integration seminar. During this seminar, fellows will engage in small group exercises, spiritual or contemplative practices and discussions about religion, spirituality, social justice, community engagement and vocation. Rev. Dr. Susan E. Young, Director for Religious and Spiritual Life, will lead the seminar. Fellows will receive a stipend of $1,000 each semester.
