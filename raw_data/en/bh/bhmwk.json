Theaim of scaling-up is to improve availability , access and adherenceto ART by all HIV-infected population. HIV-infected persons in peripheral (rural) areas are at increased risk for several medical co-morbidities including tuberculosis,bacterial and parasitic infections. As ART is successfully madeuniversally available, non-AIDS co-morbidities caused byhelminths and malaria will emerge as leading problems that willcomplicate care, adherence to ART and retention. Thesechallenges can be improved by comprehensive andmultidisciplinary management strategies. In addition a range ofinterventions such as counselling, use of treatment assist antsand integrated health services delivery need to be enhanced toimprove adherence and treatment of co-morbidities. However, concerns are raised regarding proper HIV/AIDS management in the peripheral (rural) settings which focuses onclinical monitoring and treatment of opportunistic infections.Clinical monitoring is based on WHO clinical st ages and CD4+T-lymphocyte counts. Clinicians in the peripheral (rural) settingsfaces challenges in accessing CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, HIVand AIDS clinical features not corresponding with WHO clinicalstages, co-infections and co-morbidity. The aim of the work reported in this thesis was to conduct research to investigate effects of concurrent parasites infectionsand challenges of HIV/AIDS case management on peripheral(rural) patients in order to contribute information towards bettercare for HIV/AIDS patients in Tanzania.xiii The studies were conducted at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Tanzania between April 2008 and June 2009.The research consisted of three sub-studies carried outconsecutively utilizing different study designs and populations. The first study examined the ef fects of parasite co-infection on CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, WHO clinical st aging andhaemoglobin. In addition, the study attempted to develop asimplified clinical staging by utilizing local experiences HIV/AIDSclinical manifestation. Adult patients registering for the first timeat HIV-clinic were clinically examined for malaria parasites andhelminths. CD4 counts and haemoglobin were also analyzed.Patients were initiated on treatment s according to their respectivediagnosis and followed up for six months. At 6 months, clinicalprocedures were performed similar to first contact assessment. The second study utilized a case-control design to elucidate factors associated with non-adherence to ART. Adult patientsattending care and treatment at the study clinics and being onART for at least three months were studied. Patient s with ARTadherence of less than 95%; and those with more than 95%were defined as cases and controls respectively. The third study was an observation study which documented experiences and lessons generated in the process ofimplementing ART services at Chalinze health centre. Clinicalprocedures were evaluated and document review was carriedout to solicit patients' characteristics and enrolment rates.xiv Main findings Of the 421 HIV -1 infected patients studied for p arasites co- infection, 198 (47%) were co-infected with one or more p arasites.While 93/421(22.1%) patients had helminths only co-infection,and 50/421(12.9%) had Plasmodium sp only co-infection. atistical associations between CD4+T-lymphocyte counts <200/\u00b5l, or WHO patients 18.8%). Parasites meanconcentration higher in p arasites co-infected patients (ranges47.6 to comp ared to patients without parasites co-infection (5.5pg/\u00b5l). HIV/AIDS clinical presentation showed that weight loss was the commonest symptom (48.3%); followed by chronic cough(40.8%). Most symptoms were found to be highly specific (rangingfrom 56.4% to 98.6%) with high positive predictive values (rangingfrom to 80%) in predicting p atients, and predicted well severeimmunosuppression alone or in combination of symptoms (withhigh likelihood ratios ranging from 1.83 to 3.27 at 95%CI).Headache, skin and fungal diseases presented highly butrelatively weak in predicting immunosuppression. The combination of 3 symptoms correlated with the WHO st ages III/IV with high specificity and positive predictive values, but hadxv lower sensitivity. The sensitivity of all the presenting symptoms remained lower than 52%, and was not improved by includingmore signs and symptoms in the analysis. In the evaluation of factors related to non adherence to ART, a total of 79 cases (non adherence) and 237 controls (adherent)matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of casesand controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge of ARTbenefits, adherence and eligibility . Majority of cases (73.3%) andcontrols (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services.In the univariate analysis: missed clinic appointment s due to lackof fare or other reasons and was associated with ART nonadherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-4.2,respectively). Disclosure to confidant s only and failure to discloseHIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence(mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1, associated (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7) with nonadherence to ART. Patients who were not satisfied with providerswere more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI1.2-3.8). In the multivariate analysis same factors were found tobe associated with no adherence to ART. The study at Chalinze health centre showed that, 611 care and 284 ART patients were attended between May 2007 and June2009. Majority of p atients 762/895 (85.1%) were adult s aged25-45 years, while children were 27/61 1 (4.4%) pre ART and 16/284 (5.6%) ART. 550/895 (61.5%) patients had CD4+Tlymphocytes d\"350/\u00b5l the cut-of f point for initiating ART. Thefrequency of symptoms was noted to significantly decrease withincreasing CD4 counts (p<0.001). In conclusion, we have looked at one set of p arasites and found high prevalence of malaria and helminths co-infection in HIV -infected individuals. Based on local helminths epidemiology andHIV-infected cohort specific helminths co-infection prevalencedata, mass treatment of soil transmitted helminths can bexvi confidently incorporated in HIV/AIDS care and treatment programs. HIV/AIDS clinics managing large cohort s should review and validate site specific HIV clinical manifest ations in comparisonwith CD4 counts and WHO clinical st ages. Based on localexperiences simplified guidelines are useful for resourceconstrained settings without CD4 counting facilities. These findings show that adherence is a dynamic process that varies depending on region or cohort specific adherence factors.Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specificadherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns. ART services can successively be provided at health centre level and encourages HIV-infected persons to seek care. However ,clinicians need regular clinical mentorship and supportivesupervision.1 Part I Introduction23 Chapter 1: Emergence and Evolution of HIV and AIDS 1.1 Global Burden of HIV/AIDS In 2009, UNAIDS and WHO published data showing that there are 33.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS globally. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region with 22.4 million peopleliving with HIV/AIDS. During the same period 2.7 million peoplebecame infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),1.9 million from sub-Saharan Africa and 2.0 million deaths wereaccounted for by AIDS worldwide while 1.4 million deathsoccurred in sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence of HIV variesconsiderably across sub-Saharan Africa ranging from less than1% in Niger to over 25% in Swaziland. About two thirds of infectionis through men to women sex (1) (2). Women account forapproximately 60% of people living with HIV/AIDS (1). 1.2 History and epidemiology of HIV The origin of the global HIV-pandemic is difficult to determine and when and where the first cases of AIDS and or HIV infectionoccurred are still unknown. However, retrospective studies incentral Africa reported on the epidemic increases of clinicaldiseases markers of AIDS in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Inaddition, HIV was later identified in blood samples collected fromcentral Africa which pointed to the earlier occurrence of HIVinfection in central African countries. The first reported AIDS cases were defined in young homosexual men in United States of America in 1981, who presented withaggressive Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3)(4)(5). During the same period, new cases of fatalwasting disease were described in sub-Saharan Africa inheterosexual men and women (6). Subsequently epidemiologicand virologic investigations identified the cause of AIDS asHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (7)(8).4 The route of HIV transmission was described few years later following observational studies in Europe, sub-Saharan Africaand America (9)[(10)(11). Although the disease affected differentgroups of the population in each of the three continents, it becomeapparent that HIV was transmitted through heterosexual andhomosexual contact; infected blood transfusion; intravenous druguse by sharing needles, therapeutic practices and verticaltransmission from mother to child (MTCT)(11)(10)(12). In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV transmission is largely through heterosexualcontact in adults, but also through MTCT and therapeuticpractices. During the early years of the epidemic it became clear that HIV/ AIDS was already spread worldwide killing young adults (15-49years). Sub-Saharan Africa was severely affected, harbouringtwo thirds of the global total numbers of HIV (13). Within the firstdecade of the pandemic, sub-Saharan Africa experienced ageneralized epidemic and was hit hard by the disease. Manycountries of the region reached HIV prevalence of 10% to 40%(14). Socio-cultural, civil unrest in the great lakes and economic factors facilitated the quick spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa region(15). Wide spread poverty, and cultural practices that encouragedinheritance of widows and ritual cleansing played a substantialrole in HIV transmission (16) (17). Poverty forces young womento engage into commercial sex; while young men migrate to urbancentres as traders and casual manual workers. These economicactivities exposed both young men and women to high risk sexbehaviour. The presence of behavioural factors and the biologicinfluence of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) facilitated rapidtransmission of HIV (18).5 1.3 Global HIV prevention methods After recognition of the major routes of HIV-infection, prevention measures were designed and instituted globally. HIVIAIDSawareness creation through mass education campaigns usingpublic media; and declaration of one's HIV-positive status inpublic; especially that of celebrities, created awareness of thedisease and helped to draw attention of the internationalcommunity (19). Abstinence; be faithful to one partner; and use of Condom (ABC) were introduced and still are key measures to curtail further spread of the disease (20). Male and femalecondoms provide a proven and affordable prevention option (21).Other measures include prevention of mother to child HIVtransmission (PMTCT) by use of Nevirapine, AZT or combinationtherapy (22). Blood screening for HIV and Syphilis beforetransfusion; and voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) areimportant interventions undertaken to prevent HIV infection.Needle exchange programs were introduced as part of theprevention methods for Intravenous Drug Use (IDU) (23). Recently, additional prevention measures include male circumcision, vaginal microbicides and use of antiretroviral inpost-exposure prophylaxis (24) (25). Male circumcision has beenendorsed by the World Health Organization as one of thepreventive measures after results of multi-country clinical trialsconducted in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa (26). Vaginalmicrobicides the only prevention method that can be controlledby women have been waited for more than two decades.Recently, a South Africa clinical trial produced results on vaginalmicrobicides containing tenofovir gel which provided efficaciousprotection against HIV-1 transmission in women (27). It is thefirst time for a biological intervention against HIV-1 to be verysuccessful with high level of efficacy. HIV-1 vaccines asprevention methods are under development (28), and severalcandidates are at various stages of development (29). Theexistence of different HIV-1 sub-types and the continuous6 mutation of the virus posses a great challenge to development of universal vaccine. In sub-Saharan African region alone thereis more than 5 different sub-types genetically distinct HIV-1isolates (30) (31). Successful implementation of the fore mentioned measures depends heavily on a country's political will, economicaldevelopment and readiness to acknowledge HIV as a humandisaster and availability of international community support (32).Uganda and Senegal represent two success stories in sub-Saharan Africa. Uganda has brought estimated prevalence ratedown to 5% by the end of 2001 from an estimated peak of closeto 14% in the early 1990s with strong prevention campaigns (20).HIV prevalence has stabilized in Senegal at a relatively low level(30). Uganda responded much earlier to the epidemic thanTanzania. Tanzania government acknowledged HIV/AIDS as ahuman catastrophe in 1999 almost two decades after the firstcase was described in Kagera Region (33). 1.4 HIV and AIDS care and treatment In 1986, dramatic progress in the medical treatment of AIDS was made by the introduction of azidothymidine or Zidovudine(AZT), an anticancer drug that was effective at slowing down theHIV virus (34). The U.S Food and Drug Administration approvedthe use of dideoxycytidine (ddC) in combination with AZT foradult patients with advanced HIV infection who were continuingto show signs of clinical or immunological deterioration. This wasthe first successful use of combination drug therapy for thetreatment of AIDS. More drugs were gradually introduced intomedical practice, including Lamivudine (3TC), Nevirapine andothers (35) . Successive use of combination antiretroviral therapy and theimprovement in health of those had been ill in hospitals in theUSA, created hopes of a complete cure. The approach to7 treatment was described as \"hit early, hit hard\", starting ART with the goal of virologic suppression and eliminate all reservoirs.It was learnt that aggressive treatment with multiple drugs canconvert deadly AIDS into chronic, manageable disorder likediabetes. Important issues of drug toxicity, resistance andadherence became considerations (36). Currently, there are more than 19 antiretroviral drugs approved for the treatment of HIV infection, in 3 mechanistic classes (37)(31): HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitorsand HIV entry inhibitors. Nucleoside Reverse TranscriptaseInhibitors (NRTIs): the primary mechanism of action of this classis inhibition of viral RNA-dependent DNA (NNRTIs) unlike the NRTIs, they are not directlyincorporated into the viral DNA but instead inhibit replicationdirectly by bind-ing to the enzyme reverse transcriptase.Resistance to these drugs develops rapidly, especial-ly whenused alone. Protease Inhibitors (PIs) competitively inhibit theHIV protease enzyme whose activity is critical for the terminalmaturation of infectious virions (37) (31). This inhibition prevents the maturation of virions capable of infecting other cells. HIVentry inhibitors include CCR5 inhibitors and integrase strandtransfer inhibitor (37). 1.4.1 HIV and AIDS current case management Until 2004, because of high cost and complexity of administering ARVs, drugs were mostly limited to treating HIV-infected patientsin the developed world (38). Due to global initiatives the pricesof antiretroviral drugs have fallen sharply, treatment is becomingwidely available and is provided free in developing countries.HIV case management is different between developed anddeveloping countries due to variable resources availability. Patientassessment, monitoring and treatment in developed countriesinvolve a range of complex laboratory testing and many drug8 regimes as compared to developing countries. For example in USA, drug resistance testing before initiation of therapy and useof CCR5 inhibitors (Maraviroc) which are expensive undertakingin developing countries. WHO developed guidelines for ART tobe used in resource limited countries and is adapted to countryspecific conditions (39). But still there is variability in HIV casemanagement in resource limited countries between central andperipheral (rural) clinics due to uneven resources allocation whichtend to favour the central clinics. 1.4.2 Patients' entry to HIV and AIDS care and treatment Patients are identified after a HIV-positive antibody test from: voluntary counselling and testing units (VCT); PMTCT at RCHservices and Provider Initiated Testing and Counselling (PITC)in medical wards and outpatient clinics; tuberculosis clinic;sexually transmitted Infection (STI) clinic. HIV-1 infection can bediagnosed by detection of specific antigens (DNA PCR in infantsand children<2years), antibodies or both from plasma, wholeblood, serum, or saliva. Health care workers provide rapid HIVtests (A sequence of two tests) and confirmatory tests may beperformed by using ELISA test or Western blot (where available)in laboratory (40). Before the test is performed; the patient istaken through a session of counselling and HIV education in agroup or one by one counselling depending on the setting [(41).Then, the patient has the option of accepting the test (Opt-out) . After confirmation of the HIV-positive status the patient is referredto the Care and treatment clinic for continuous managementand monitoring. 1.4.3 Initiation of antiretroviral therapy The initial assessment of a HIV patient includes clinical and laboratory evaluation (42). Then, the patient clinical disease isclassified according to WHO clinical disease staging criteria (43):Stage 1- Asymptomatic; Stage 2-Mild disease; Stage 3-Advanceddisease; and Stage 4-Severe disease. In places where laboratory9 investigation are not available; Patients with WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 are eligible for starting ARVs treatment. Laboratory investigation such as haematology, chemistry and CD4 cell counts are done to provide addition information andtreatment monitoring. ARV treatment is better commenced aftera combination of clinical and immunological staging. Althoughthere are addition considerations but a patient with CD4d\"350cells/mm3 is eligible to start ART regardless of clinical stage.Previous guidelines considered the cut-off point of CD4d\"200cells/mm3 as a threshold at which the body can still mountimmune response and below which the risk of OpportunisticInfection increases. Patients with HIV and tuberculosis co-infection regardless of CD4 cell count levels and pregnant womenwith CD4d\" 350 cells/mm3 are eligible for ART. ART is notindicated for patients with CD4>350cells/mm3. Beyond clinicaleligibility, it is important that the patient's willingness, readinessand ability to be on ART adherently be assessed and addressed.The patient is made to understand that ART is a lifelong treatment;and the importance of adherence to treatment and common drugtoxicities (39). The best time point to start ART treatment to asymptomatic patients with CD4>350cells/mm3; and modest levels of viraemia(less than 100,000 copies per ml); remains controversial (40)(36). Early depletion of gut CD4 lymphocytes, increasing viraldiversity and the poor generation abilities of key populations ofthe immune system provide arguments for beginning treatmentas early as possible. Additional considerations include long-termdrug toxicities; treatment costs and immune reconstitutiondisease are some of the complications of long term HAART (41). Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is recommended to all HIV infected patients with CD4<350 cells/mm3 or clinical stages 2, 3 and 4 including pregnant women in resource limited settings. Clinical trials have showed consistent benefit of Cotrimoxazole10 prophylaxis in the reduction of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV with varying CD4 counts with and withoutMycobacterium tuberculosis (44). The recommended criteria to start ART confer benefit to patients on continuous clinical monitoring identified prior to profoundimmunosuppression. Studies have shown that patientspresenting with pre ART of CD4<50cells/mm3, have a greaterrisk of death soon after starting ART (45). Several factors mayaccount to this high risk of mortality: at a lower CD4 cell countsevere opportunistic infection occurs including disseminatedTuberculosis (46); Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrometend to occur more frequent in patients with lowest CD4 cells.Patients in resource limited settings usually are identified late inthe disease progression with CD4<200cells/mm3 or clinical stage4. ART-LINC collaboration recoded 4% mortality rate in the firstsix months which dropped to 2% in the next 6 months of activepatients follow up. The early deaths were attributed to advanceddisease (47). 1.4.4 Antiretroviral therapy The standard of care for treatment of HIV infection has evolved from the use of single-drug therapy, to dual-nucleoside analoguetherapy to the current standard of care, 3-drug therapy with 2nucleoside analogues in combination with inhibitor or a protease inhibitor. First lineARV combination regimen for adults and adolescent ART naivepatients recommended by the WHO for use in resource limitedsettings or lopinavir/ritonavir Zidovudine (3TC) +atazanavir (ATV) with boost ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir These combinations were formulated considering less drugtoxicity, simplification of administration, less antagonism and fewchances of early development of viral mutations (41). Commonearly and potentially severe toxicities are hypersensitivity toNNRTIs (EFV and NVP) occurring within the weeks of therapy(48). Others include AZT-related anaemia and neutropeniapresenting within few months after initiation of (49).Stavudine causes long-term toxicities e.g. lipoatrophy andperipheral neuropathy; Stavudine is no longer in use in USA andEurope and is been phased out in resource limited settings (42).It is still in use in developing countries for reasons of cost andavailability. Hepatic, renal and lactic acidosis drug toxicitiesrequire laboratory tests to be identified. Common ARV toxicitiescan be summarized in the following groups: Haematologicaltoxicity most seen with AZT(50); Mitochondrial dysfunction TDF; caused by NNRTI and sometimes NRTI, ABC and somePIs; other metabolic abnormalities are more common withProtease Inhibitors (51) . 1.4.5 Clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients on ART Ideal patient and ARVs drugs monitoring involve: clinicalprogression; immunological; viral load measurement; and drugresistance monitoring. Drug resistance monitoring testing (by useof both genotyping and phenotyping); viral load (HIV RNA levels)measurement; and CD4 T-lymphocytes cell count in adults and12 CD4% in infants are part of the routine standard care in developed countries(39). In most sub Saharan countries patient monitoring is limited to: Clinical progression based on WHO disease stages and limitedlaboratory tests. Laboratory tests performed includehaematological, biochemistry and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.Each patient should have at least these tests done at baselinebefore initiating treatment. CD4+ T-lymphocyte count can thenbe repeated at least every 6 months. Monthly assessment ofhaematological and biochemistry parameters are performed toassess drug toxicities. ELISA assay of HIV-1 P 24 antigen in plasma is another method that can be used to monitor patients on ARTin places where viral load is not available (52). P24 ELISA assayis relative less expensive compared to viral load measurements,thus can be adopted for use in rural district hospitals. However, these methods and parameters cannot be used to monitor patients in peripheral (rural) health centres due to lackof qualified staff and laboratory equipments. Only district andreferral hospitals can perform these tests. Again, routine dailyshipping of samples from rural health centres to districtlaboratories is challenged by logistic issues like transportproblems and costs. It is therefore important to research theminimum essential laboratory requirements that can be used tomonitor HIV patients in rural settings. Good clinical progression is assessed by determination of weight gain and reduced morbidity from opportunistic infections; andimprovement in patient's quality of life. Appearance or persistingopportunistic infections, or lack of weight gain, may indicatetreatment failure and so the need to consider changing regimens.Treatment is to be considered successful if the viral loaddecreases by 1 to 2 logs (10 to 100 folds) from the baselinelevel. However in most cases, CD4+ T-lymphocyte count will beused instead of viral load thus a rise in CD4+ T-lymphocyte count13 will indicate success. Treatment failure on the other hand is indicated by a viral load increase of 0.3 to 0.5 logs or a 30% fallin CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (39). 1.4.6 T reatment failure The introduction of HAART worldwide improved the trends of HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality even in developing countries(53). Patients can now survive longer than before HAART (54)(55). Great efforts of the international community have beenemployed to assist developing countries, especially sub SaharanAfrica to fight AIDS. The combined efforts resulted in betterunderstanding of the dynamics of the epidemic. Universal accessto care and treatment through the UNAIDS \"3by5\" agenda isachieving success in making ARVs available to the poorcommunities in countries like Tanzania (43). However, treatment failure causes a considerable challenge to both patients and providers. Currently, there is no standarddefinition of treatment failure. The WHO defines treatment failurein three groups of clinical failure, immunological failure (basedon CD4 cell count) and virological failure. Clinical failure isconsidered when there is new or recurrent WHO stage 4conditions (with exemptions) (39). Immunological failure isdefined as fall of CD4 cell count to pre-therapy baseline (orbelow); or 50% fall from the on-treatment peak value; or persistentCD4 levels below 100cells/mm3. Virological failure is consideredwhen plasma viral load is greater than 10 3 copies/ml. Several other clinical and immunological issues need to be consideredbefore deciding existence of treatment failure. While virologicalfailure is inability to achieve an undetectable HIV-RNA(<50copies/ml) after six months of HAART or sustained rise ofHIV-RNA of >50copies/ml or >400 copies/ml followingsuppression below this level (56). There are a number of causes of treatment failure which include: HIV virus mutation; baseline patient characteristics; baseline drug14 side toxicity; pharmacokinetic issues; and other reasons specific toindividual patients. In the Swiss and Hopkins HIV Cohort Studies,some of the factors which were associated with higher risk forvirologic failure included lower CD4 cell count and symptomaticHIV disease at presentation prior to ART and missed clinicappointments (58). In addition suboptimal adherence to ART isassociated with treatment failure. These reasons are commonin rural limited resource settings in Tanzania (59). 1.4.7 Access, Availability and Adherence to ART Access to ART is a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa dueto limited resources and the high burden of HIV and AIDS. At theend of 2008, the estimated coverage of ART in this region was44% (60). Despite this encouraging progress, the majority ofpatients in need of ART in peripheral (rural) areas still are unableto access treatment given the distances from ART clinics. Thefew patients that access ART cannot sustain regular monthlyfollow-ups and often drop out of treatment. In recent years,considerable energy and money have been spent trying toachieve universal access to treatment for HIV and AIDS . Such efforts have generated replicable experiences regarding provisionof ART in peripheral (rural) settings. The extraordinary chronicdisease clinic at Saint Francis Designated District Hospital atIfakara is one of the few peripheral based programs reachingthe poor patients in need of ART (61). This program highlightsmajor issues in the process of scaling-up ART in resource limitedperipheral settings: first is the need for a functional patient referralsystem; secondly uninterrupted supply of ART. Stock out of ARTis critical in these remote (peripheral) areas where patients cannotafford return multiple clinic visits. The third lesson learned is theuse of treatment assistants, who support the patient to accessand adhere to ART. Non adherence to therapy is a major cause of drug resistance. It might be inevitable after prolonged periods of ARV use to develop15 resistance. However, the major interest is to delay drug resistance development because there are limited available drug regimensoptions. A patient is expected to achieve more than 95% ofadherence to protect resistance viral strain development (62).This level of adherence is challenging in resource constrainedsettings. Social and economic factors impact on the patients'capacity to achieve adequate adherence (63). Provision of freeantiretroviral therapy and promotion of social coping mayenhance adherence and reduce possibility of development ofdrug resistance (59). Stigma, poverty and distance from the careand treatment centres are some of the socio-economic barriersto adequate adherence to therapy. Other factors found to beassociated with drug resistance development include lower CD4cell of <200 cells/\u00b5l, and the missing of a scheduled clinic visit inthe past month (64). These factors are frequently found inresource limited countries. Population socio-economic diversities,antiviral drug resistance and the HIV virus dynamics need to beclosely studied. Pill burden and drug toxicities are additional problems contributing to poor adherence to ART (65) (66). Pill burden is been addressedby development of fixed dose combination formulations; anddrugs with long half life which can be taken once a day. A strategyto ensure lifelong compliance to HAART was suggested to bestructured treatment interruptions. The rationale for this approachwas based on the theory that the body immune system cancontrol low levels of viral replication after suppression by HAART.Treatment interruption was proved to have no clinical benefit inthe SMART trial (67). Several approaches are used by health care providers at care and treatment clinic to monitor patient adherence to ARVs andprophylaxis of opportunistic infections (OI). The most commonlyused are pill count; pharmacy records; patient adherence toscheduled visits and clinicians assessment. These methods areuseful monitoring tools when applied in combination.1617 Chapter 2: Co-morbidity, Opportunistic Infection and Interaction Residents of sub-Saharan Africa experience more ill health than people in other continents. This is due to the presence of endemicinfectious diseases coupled with HIV-infection and Opportunisticinfections. Co-morbidity can be defined as occurrence of combination of disease conditions in the same person at the same time.Opportunistic infections include all infections and malignancieswhich occur when the immune system is weakened. There aredifferent diseases causative agents found in the tropics, includingviruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths and arthropods (68).A relatively small percentage of these pathogens cause a majorityof serious health effects to HIV-infected persons (69). Thedistribution of these pathogens is very diverse depending onfavourable environment, social behaviours and ecological factorsthat result in their transmission (70). HIV and tropical infections affect each other mutually (71). HIV infection may alter the natural history of tropical infectiousdiseases, impede rapid diagnosis, or reduce the efficacy of antparasitic treatment (72). Tropical infections may facilitate thetransmission of HIV and accelerate progression fromasymptomatic HIV infection to AIDS. Disease severity dependson the virulence of the infecting organisms and the competenceof the immune system of the infected person (73). People withweakened immune system experience much more severedisease even to causes of mild infections (74). Persons infectedwith sexually transmitted diseases especially those associatedwith genital ulceration, have increased susceptibility to HIV-infection due to lack of skin protective barrier. Activation of the immune system by tropical infections renders the T-cell lymphocytes susceptible to HIV infection which results18 into HIV disease progression (75). Infections that activate the immune system and increases secretions of cytokines,chemokines and chemokines receptors have been shown toincrease the susceptibility and pathogenesis to HIV-virus infection(76). Diseases like tuberculosis and soiltransmitted helminths which causes up-regulation of CCR5expression facilitates HIV infection in individuals with theseinfections (77) . Infections that affect the cellular immune system have been shown to increase HIV-1 virus replication which resultsin disease progression (73). On the other hand, effects of HIV-infections on tropical diseases are the result of compromised cellular immune system becauseHIV targets CD4 + T lymphocytes and macrophages (37). Thus, organisms that require intact cellular immune system for theireradication can easily cause infection (78). The compromisedimmune system increases susceptibility to new infection andreactivation of latent infection (73). As result, HIVimmunosuppression facilitates infections, increase the rate ofinfection, change disease presentation and may complicatetreatment. Most of the major tropical diseases depend on CD4T-cell lymphocytes and macrophages for their elimination fromthe body, thus HIV infection fuels parasitic diseases (79). Forexample, risk of parasitaemia and clinical malaria is increasedin semi immune HIV infected adults in malaria regions (80).Isospora belli and cryptosporidium results into severe chronicdiarrhoea disease in HIV infected persons. These observations may explain why HIV in sub Saharan Africa is easily transmitted, and has a faster clinical progression andhigh mortality. Again, the above citations can explain thevariations in clinical presentation of HIV in this region. At thebeginning of the epidemic, chronic diarrhoea, wasting (slimdisease), chronic fever without an obvious source, and pulmonarydisease were the syndromes that marked AIDS (68). The clinicalpicture of AIDS had changed; the clinical presentation depends19 on the prevalent infectious agents. In holoendemic malaria regions recurrent malaria fever episodes is most common in HIVinfected persons (80). Enteropathic AIDS is most common insome areas, usually accompanied with diarrhoea (81).Tuberculosis, both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary, is thesupreme complicating infection. Herpes zoster is frequently thefirst clinical presentation, and has a 95% positive predictive valuefor HIV positive status (82). While in other settings septicaemiadue to non-typhoid salmonellae, Escherichia coli andStreptococcus pneumoniae was the most common diagnosis inHIV-infected persons (73) The current understanding of the interaction between HIV and tropical diseases calls for further research on; patient responseto treatment in presence of co-infection. And, further elucidationof the manifestation of HIV-related diseases in peripheral (rural)settings is needed to optimize patient clinical care. The importance of opportunistic infection to human health was manifested by the emergence of HIV. The risk of different groupsof opportunistic infections typically increases at different stagesof HIV infection in relation to CD4 Candidiasis.While T-cell lymphocytes count of lower than 200 cells/\u00b5l, several other diseases appear, including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Mycobacterium Avium complex and others (44). The highest risk for Opportunistic Infection occurs when the CD4count is between 50-100 cells/\u00b5l. Some of these diseases caninfect people with normal immune systems, but with HIV, theyoccur at a much higher rate. It also takes longer for a personwith HIV to recover from a disease than it takes for someonewith a healthy immune system.20 Table 2. 1: Distribution of selected opportunistic infections reported from studies in sub-Saharan Africa* COUNTRYSummary of common Opportunistic Infections Central Africa Cryptosporidium species, Salmonella species Uganda Cryptococcus Senegal Toxoplasmosis * Adaptation from Charles B Holmes et al Review of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1-Related Opportunistic Infections in Sub Saharan Africa: HIV and AIDS 200321 When the immune system is very weak due to advanced HIV disease or AIDS, some infections can result into systemicdissemination (Visceral leishmania) (83). Diseases like AIDS thatspread to involve a number of different organs, posses a greatchallenge to clinical management. Similarly, opportunisticinfections appearing at a late stage of HIV infection usually resultin a poor prognosis. For instance, Cryptococcus meningitis canoccur with CD4 T-cell lymphocyte count cells/\u00b5l and isassociated with high mortality (84). Mycobacterial tuberculosis is one of the most common opportunistic diseases that carry the highest cause of morbidityand mortality in HIV infected patients. HIV and Mycobacteriumtuberculosis have a synergistic interaction; each accentuatesprogression of the other resulting in increased morbidity andmortality in poor settings (86). Atypical mycobacterial also causeserious disease in immunocompromized patients (86) (87).Mycobacterium Avium complex is reported to complicate Immunereconstitution Syndrome in the first 3 months of ART initiation(88). Its diagnosis requires culture of lymph node fine needleaspirates. Therefore, it is difficult to diagnose MycobacteriumAvium complex in areas with limited access to laboratory withcapacity to perform mycobacterium culture. Various types of fungal infections are also common among HIV- infected patients. However, Cryptococcus neoformans andPneumocystis carinii Pneumonia are the most common life threatening fungal infection in AIDS patients (89)]. Candidiasis,despite of being the commonest fungal infection in HIV/AIDSpatients, its overall impact in patient disease progression andoutcome is less documented in sub Saharan Africa. A study inUganda found Oral Candidiasis in more than 70% of TASO clientsand was reported to cause mild to moderate discomfort to thepatients (90). However, the study did not describe the clinicaland immunological impact (CD4 increase) of Candidiasis to thepatients after treatment.22 Diagnosis of Opportunistic Infection is variable, some can be diagnosed clinically and others require laboratory tests forconfirmation. Opportunistic Infection with unique skin lesions likeCandidiasis and Kaposi's sarcoma can be diagnosed clinicallywith certain. While other Opportunistic Infection which presentwith multiple signs and symptoms like Tuberculosis,Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia and Cryptococcus may requirecombination of both clinical and laboratory tests to make adiagnosis. Other diagnosis methods for Opportunistic Infectioninclude: Microscopic examination, biopsy, X-ray, Blood tests andother disease specific specialized methods. Most of the Opportunistic Infections are preventable; either by use of ART or specific drugs recommended for prophylaxis ofOpportunistic Infection. For example, use of co-trimoxazole canprotect against Cryptococcus andM. Avium respectively (91). The main challenge remains to beadherence to therapy and implementation of the guidelines. Inaddition data is lacking on the actual prevalence of OpportunisticInfection, levels of adherence to therapy and pattern of guidelinesimplementation in rural settings.23 HIV- INFECTION /AIDS SYMPTOMS CLINICAL PERFORMANCE COMPETENCE + MOTIVATION- BARRIERS CLINICAL OUTCOME RECOVERY, CHRONICITY, DISABILITY OR DIAGNOSTIC TEST OF VARYING ACCURACY, UTILITY AND AVAILABILITY ARV TREATMENT OF VARYING EFFICACY AND TOXICITYPATIENT FACTORS -COMPLIANCE, PATIENT EDUCATION AND SOCIO- CO-INFECTION AND CO- MORBIDITY +OPP.INFECTION Figure 2. 1: Conceptual FrameworkECONOMIC FACTORS DEATH2425 Figure 3.1: Water crisis in the study area2627 Chapter 3: Epidemiology and Prevention of HIV and AIDS inTanzania 3.1 HIV-1 epidemiology in Tanzania HIV was initially found in a geographic band stretching from Central Africa across to countries of East and Southern Africa(14). The epidemic began gradually to move south throughUganda, Kenya and Tanzania to Southern African countries. Thefirst cases of AIDS were described in a hospital in Kagera regionwestern Tanzania in 1983. Apparently, AIDS was locallyassociated with cross border trade between Uganda and westernTanzania. Initially, HIV affected mostly traders and was named\"Juliana\" because of the popular brand of shirts imported fromUganda at that time. The disease quickly reached all big urbancentres of Tanzania. Prostitutes and their clients suffered fromprofuse chronic diarrhoea and profound loss of weight, and thenAIDS was named \"Slim disease\". The same \"Slim\" disease wasalready described in Uganda and Zaire (92) By 1985, the country had an estimated HIV prevalence of 1.3%, which increased steadily to reach 7% by the end of 2004 (93)(94). In 2003, between 1.2 and 2.3 million people in the agegroup 0-49 years were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS.The most vulnerable and affected groups include: women 30-34 years old; and men 40-44 years old; sex workers; people inthe transport sector, mines, police force, military, prisons andprisoners; refugees. Occasionally, a few elderly people get HIV-infection while caring their sick relatives and some forced intonew roles as caregivers without support themselves (95). Urbanresidents tend to have higher prevalence as compared to ruralresidents. However, overall women are much more affected thanmen, and the prevalence increases with age, education leveland wealth quintile (94). Three regions, Mbeya, Iringa and Dares Salaam, have a particularly high prevalence above 10% (93)(33).28 The major route of HIV transmission in the country is through heterosexual contact; exposure to infected blood; mother to childtransmission and intravenous drug use. Blood transfusion andunsafe injections might have contributed substantially to HIVinfection in children and adults in the early years of the epidemic(96). Needle sterilization by boiling and treatment of severeanaemia due to malaria disease by blood transfusion wascommon practice while methods of HIV screening of donatedblood were not available. Intravenous drug use with needlesharing and re-use is common in big cities, but is more prominentin Zanzibar. 3.2 HIV-1 prevention efforts in Tanzania Tanzania National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) was established and formally launched in 1988 with the overall aim of coordinating prevention activities, reducing the incidence ofHIV infection and its associated morbidity and mortality. A furtheraim was to establish a link between the government actors andnon-government organizations (NGOs) involved in HIV and AIDSactivities. This resulted into formulation of HIV and AIDS policies, Tanzania commission for AIDS (TACAIDS) and adaptation and implementation of global preventive measures. NACP receivestechnical and financial support from Global Fund to fight AIDS,Tuberculosis and Malaria, Clinton Health Initiative and PEPFAR(97). Other organizations like M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res areproviding additional funds and technical support. HIV-1 prevention messages and intervention are provided in almost all health care service delivery points in different forms.During routine clinical care patients are informed by health careworkers on the importance of abstinence, being faithful to onepartner, condom use, early HIV diagnosis and treatment ofsexually transmitted infections.29 Pregnant women are counselled and tested for HIV-1 at Reproductive and Child Health unit, and those who are found tobe HIV-positive receive PMTCT services. While infant feedingcounselling and safer pregnancy messages are provided to allantenatal attendees routinely as part of the health educationservices. There are also several other prevention programs designed to cover different at risk population groups in all parts of the country.Such as the condom use program which aims at improvingaccess and proper use of condoms, Voluntary counselling andtesting, work place HIV prevention for health care workers, malecircumcision, and several others. Radio and television broadcastHIV prevention messages. Figure 3. 2: Structure of the Tanzania National AIDS Control Program30 3.3 Challenges of expanding Antiretroviral Treatment in Tanzania The Tanzania National AIDS Control Program provides guidelines and coordinates the provision of free antiretroviral therapy forthe whole country. There are major challenges in terms of accessand adherence to ART. Despite the achievements ofregionalization of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) whichhave increased ART clinics coverage in the entire country, themajority of patients in peripheral areas travel long distances toART clinics and cannot be retained into care and treatment dueto transport constraints. Although some peripheral ART clinicsuse treatment supporters to enhance access and adherence toART (61), such strategies are not yet universal in Tanzania. These challenges are not limited to Tanzania: the use of ART in sub Saharan Africa (SSA) was delayed for more than a decadeafter introduction of combination ART in developed countries.The delay was a result of concerns that the weak health systemsand adherence problems in SSA populations may lead towidespread ARVs virological resistance (98) (99). Furthergrounds for concern were related to the possibility offragmentation of the health system and worsening health careinequalities on the grounds that there were more cost-effectiveinterventions available given the limited funding baskets at thetime (100) (101). There were other numerous health system factors that are still considered to date as major constraints to introducing ART inpoor resource settings including inadequate service deliveryinfrastructure, weak drug regulatory and weak supply systemsand demand side barriers (stigma and affordability) (102). It wasthought that these barriers would result in poor and unsustainedtreatment outcomes if not addressed before implementation ofART services.31 Health worker shortages in the face of HIV/AIDS have been exposed by the practice of delivering ART through primary healthcare services. The shortage of qualified staff to be specificallytrained and become comfortable in managing medical problemsin HIV-infected persons is still a major setback to achieving botha wide coverage and quality of care. In most rural settings,patients are managed by less qualified staff, with poor staff moralecaused by logistic difficulties, poor living conditions and lackingappropriate working tools (103). Such factors were consideredas serious barriers in scaling up ART and thus initially ART wereestablished in urban hospitals and further delayed in reachingmajority of people in rural areas. There are still more short comings raised against ART scaling- up in resource poor settings which are related to unintendeddiversion of resources away from other vital health care servicessuch as maternal and child health care services and nutrition(104). The issue of quality of care and sustainability of services is also considered as a major barrier since sustained funding to ensurean adequate health care system cannot be met by all SSAcountries. This is evidenced by failure of African Governmentsto fulfilling the Abuja declaration to commit 15% of their budgetsto health (105). Large-scale access to HIV/AIDS care andtreatment and prevention programs in SSA countries have beenmade possible by donor funded multinational investments. Inaddition, since ART programs reduce or delay mortality amongHIV-infected persons, countries will need to contain an ever-larger numbers of people living with HIV (106). Thereforefinancial, health system infrastructure and human resourcescapacity need to be strengthened to cope with the ever increasingdemand. However, these challenges were outweighed by the positive benefits of which the Global initiatives explicitly set out to achieve32 in order to save lives of HIV/AIDS patients. In SSA millions of dollars have being directed towards the reduction of medicineprices, infrastructure improvement, hiring and training of staff.The World Health Organization catalyzed these efforts byannouncing its aim to help put 3 million people on ART indeveloping countries by the end of 2005. In Tanzania, arehabilitation program was initiated where laboratories andconsultation rooms were upgraded and provided with all essentialequipment. Capacity building programs were undertaken to trainof health care workers to enable them to perform HIV-testing,CD4+T lymphocyte counting and HIV/AIDS case managementin all hospitals and selected health centres. Service delivery challenges related to the complex management of ART are being addressed through the use of simple fixeddose ARVs combination regimens, clinical and laboratorymonitoring, access to second line regimens and managementof side-effects. 3.4 Rationale for the PhD research The pattern and clinical manifestation of HIV and AIDS is changing continuously due to viral mutations, availability of OIsdrugs and co-infections; and is different from place to place.The region and population differences in the clinical picture sincethe early days of the epidemic were influenced by the endemicpathogens of the affected population and HIV virus mutations(107). With the introduction of ART and OIs prophylaxis, theclinical picture has changed even further. Since HIV/AIDS careand treatment in resource poor settings entirely depends on WHOclinical staging, it is justified to always update our knowledge ofHIV/AIDS clinical presentation. The priority is ascertainment ofthe heterogeneity of the clinical picture in HIV-infected semi-urbanand peripheral (rural) populations in order to improve on patientcare.33 There is a global focus on the management of AIDS and related OIs with little emphasis on co-infectious diseases which areprevalent in resource limited rural areas. This can be explainedby lack of clinical data on actual prevalence rate and impact ofco-infectious diseases on the health of HIV-infected people. Tobe effective in providing HIV/AIDS care and treatment inperipheral (rural) settings the emphasis should be propertreatment and monitoring of co-infections and or co-morbidityand treatment of opportunistic infections. Therefore, it is importantto estimate the prevalence of co-infections and HIV clinicalmanifestations in HIV and AIDS patients. This subsequently willresult into regular revision of the current HIV and AIDS care andtreatment guidelines. Patient adherence to ART plays a major role in the effectiveness of anti-HIV drugs. Poor adherence to treatment results inineffective suppression of viral replication which leads to theemergence of drug resistance viral mutations. Adherence totherapy can be monitored and managed at a health facility levelby clinicians. Proper monitoring requires understanding ofindividual patients' living context, barriers and influencing factorsto adequate adherence. The current adherence methods in usewere developed without consideration of populationheterogeneity between urban and peripheral (rural) areas. Thesedifferences need to be assessed and find out whether they impacton adherence. This PhD thesis addressed the above raised questions through a comprehensive approach to crucial issues important for the scaling-up care and treatment services to peripheral (rural) areas.3435 Figure 4.1: A nurse assistant explaining the study to patients3637 Part II Research Goal, Objectives and Principal Methods3839 Chapter 4 : Goals and Objectives 4.1 The goal of this study To conduct research to investigate effects of concurrent parasitesinfections and challenges of HIV/AIDS case management onrural and semi-urban patients in order to contribute informationtowards better care for HIV/AIDS patients in Tanzania.

Tumbi Regional Hospital islocated 40 km from Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital ofTanzania. The hospital has a bed capacity of 200 beds and servesas a regional referral Hospital. Chalinze Health Centre is located70 km from Tumbi Hospital at the junction of the main upcountryhighways with an HIV prevalence of 15%, whereas theprevalence in Pwani Region was 7%. Both heath facilities provideservices to a mixture of patients from semi-urban and ruralvillages. Most residents of Chalinze reside in rural villages andgenerate income from farming and trading of different types ofgoods. Tumbi Hospital runs two separate HIV/AIDS clinics for adults and children. At the time of initiation of this study in April 2008,Tumbi Hospital had enrolled a total of 3851 and Chalinze HealthCentre had enrolled a total of 450 patients to care and treatment.Chalinze Health Centre HIV/AIDS care and treatment clinicsstarted services in May 2007.41 4.2.2 Research approach and methods The research consisted of three sub-studies carried out consecutively utilizing different study designs and populations. Objective 1: To investigate challenges of HIV and AIDS case managementrelated to changing HIV-clinical manifestation and parasitic co-infections in rural and semi-urban settings and propose measuresto improve HIV-infected patient care. The approach: This was a longitudinal and descriptive study design and used a structured clinical report form adopted from the Ifakara clinical surveillance system and IMCI (for children)was used by the attending clinician (Principal investigator andthe assistant clinician) to document patient disease history, clinicalfeatures, diagnosis, laboratory investigation and treatment. Objective 2: To investigate factors associated with non-adherence to ART ina rural setting in order to provide data for public healthintervention. The approach A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital andChalinze Health centre. A structured questionnaire was used toassess adherence to doses, food instruction and time schedule.Patients with less than 95% adherence to time schedule; doseand food were defined as non-adherence cases. Patients with100% adherence became controls. A structured questionnairecontaining factors known to be associated with non-adherenceto ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate andmultivariate conditional logistic regression were performed toidentify factors associated with non-adherence. Objective 3: To document experiences and lessons generated in the processof implementing ART care and treatment at a health centre in aresource limited setting.42 The approach: This was a cross sectional study carried out to study patients registered between May 2007 to 31April 2009. Two different methods of data collection were used; non-participant observations of health providers' performance andretrospective pre ART and ART registers reviews. References 1. Unaids WHO.

However, there have been fewstudies to ascertain the interference of parasitic co-infection inresource limited settings where HIV/AIDS management largelydepend on CD4+T cells counts and WHO clinical staging. Thisstudy, therefore, aimed to determine the prevalence of parasitesand their association with CD4+Tcells changes and clinicalclassification of HIV-infection in patients attending care andtreatment in Tanzania. Methods Adult HIV-infected patients registering for the first time at HIV/AIDS clinics were recruited; physical examination and laboratorytests were performed at baseline and after 6 th months. Patients were assigned a clinical stage and screened for helminths andPlasmodium sp . co-infection, CD4+Tcells, haemoglobin and HIV- 1 p24 antigen. Results Of the 421 HIV-1 infected patients studied, 198 (47.0%) wereco-infected with one or more parasites. While 93/421(22.1%)patients had helminths only co-infection, and 50/421(12.9%) hadPlasmodium sp only co-infection. Mixed sp and helminths co-infection was diagnosed betweenCD4 or WHO clinical of anaemia (AOR 2.1, 95%CI63 1.3-3.2). In multivariable logistic (AOR 2.4, 95%CI 1.3-4.7)associated with CD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l at six months. HIV-1 P24antigen mean concentration was higher in parasites co-infectedpatients (ranges 47.6 to 56.9) compared to patients withoutparasites co-infection (5.5). Conclusions We have looked at one set of parasites and found highprevalence of malaria and helminths co-infection in HIV-infectedindividuals. Given the available reports on health impacts ofhelminths co-infection in HIV/AIDS patients and the anecdotalreports of helminths health effects even in HIV-uninfectedpersons, helminths and other prevalent parasites should not beignored in HIV/AIDS programs. And based on local helminthsepidemiology and HIV-infected cohort specific helminths co-infection prevalence data, mass treatment of soil transmittedhelminths can be confidently incorporated in HIV/AIDS care andtreatment programs. Introduction HIV-infection and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa present with diverseclinical characteristics reflecting the variety of prevalent endemicdiseases within each area. More than 100 different disease-causing agents are found in the tropics, including viruses,bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths and arthropods (1). Arelatively small proportion of these pathogens cause the majorityof serious health effects to HIV-infected persons (2). Distributionof these pathogens is geographically sensitive to favourableenvironments characterized by social behaviours and ecologicalfactors affecting the risk of their transmission (3). Concurrence of HIV and tropical infections affect each other mutually. HIV-infection in patients with parasites infection altersthe natural history of parasites diseases pathogenesis, impede64 rapid diagnosis, or reduce the efficacy of anti-parasitic treatment (4) (5). HIV-1 compromises the cellular immune system throughdestroying CD4+Tcells and macrophages (6) thus reducing theimmune system's ability to resist infection from endemicpathogens (7). HIV-infected persons are susceptible to newinfection and reactivation of (6) latent infections (1). As result,HIV-immunosuppression facilitates infections, increases theseverity of infection, changes disease presentation andcomplicates treatment (8). Of particular importance is theincreased risk of parasitaemia and clinical malaria semi immuneHIV-infected adults in endemic malaria regions (9). In addition to HIV-effects on susceptibility and pathogenesis of tropical diseases, people living with tropical infections are atincreased risk for HIV-infection and unfavourable diseaseprogression in personsmarked HIV/AIDS clinical manifestations in the early decades ofHIV epidemic. For example, protozoa infections caused chronicdiarrhoea which resulted into wasting (slim disease), chronic feverwithout an obvious source, and pulmonary disease syndromeswhich marked AIDS in sub Saharan Africa (11) (2). There isevidence that helminths species specifically alter HIV diseaseprogression. Interaction of Schistosome and HIV-infections withhost CD4+Tcells leads to bi-directional effects which are differentfrom sequelae caused by either infectious agent alone (12).Helminths infections lead to greater HIV-replication and diseaseprogression through immune activation of cellular mechanismswhich renders the CD4+Tcells susceptible to HIV-infectionresulting into increased viral load (13). High viral load isassociated with rapid CD4+Tcells death and disease progressionto AIDS (14). Untreated Strongyloides stercoralis causes hyper- infection syndrome in immunosuppressed patients during theearly stages of immune recovery after initiation of antiretroviraltherapy (ART). It is difficult to distinguish between the clinical65 manifestation of strongyloidiasis hyper-infection syndrome is distinguished and the immune-reconstitution syndrome inducedby HAART in patients with CD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l, an effect reversedby Albendazole treatment (17). Other complications of helminthsand malaria in HIV-infected persons include aggravation ofdiarrhoea, anaemia and fever symptoms (18). Although scientists still debate on the survival benefit of routine screening and treatment for helminths and other parasiticinfection in HIV-infected patients, helminths and malariainfections continue to cause morbidity and aggravated mortality(9). Treatment of parasitic infections could provide an immediatebenefit in areas where both HIV-1 and helminths are prevalent. Tanzania has overlapping high prevalence rates of HIV and parasitic infections (19). Scaling up of HIV and AIDS care andtreatment services have become well-established and widelyavailable, so quality of care becoming increasingly important andco-infections with latent helminths and malaria an important areato investigate. Monitoring of HIV-infected patients in resource limited settings depends on clinical presentation and CD4+Tcells measurements.However, there have been few studies to ascertain theinterference of parasites co-infection on CD4+Tcells and clinicalmonitoring of HIV-infected patients. This study, therefore, aimedto determine the prevalence of parasites and their associationwith CD4+Tcells changes and clinical classification of HIV-infection in patients attending care and treatment in Tanzania.66 Methods Study design Between April 2008 and March 2009, we studied HIV-infectedadult patients residents of catchments areas of Tumbi Hospitaland Chalinze Health Centre, both located in rural and peri-urbanareas outside of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Newly enrolled HIV-infected patients attending care and treatment services wereeligible for the study. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years,pregnancy, and patients with obvious severe disease conditionslike Tuberculosis, Cryptococcus Meningitis, Pneumonia andgeneralized Kaposi's sarcoma, or imminent transfer to anotherclinic. A study nurse identified eligible patients after completing routine clinic registration procedures. Patients were individually screenedfor eligibility after presenting key facts involved in the study;thereafter a standardized informed consent was administered.Consenting patients were assigned a study identification numberwhich was affixed on their clinic card and case file. The patientwas then referred to study clinician for clinical examination. Study clinicians recorded patients' clinical history, performed physical examinations and staging according to the Tanzaniaand WHO clinical guidelines for management of HIV and AIDS.Patients were referred to the laboratory for samples collection.Blood specimens were collected in EDTA tubes for enumerationof CD4+Tcells, haemoglobin and malaria smear, part of thesample was frozen and shipped to Ifakara Health Institutelaboratory for HIV-1 P24 plasma ELISA assays. Fresh stool samples were collected in sterilized plastic containers, and preserved in 10% formalin and were examined within 24hours by formol-ether concentration techniques (20). Stoolsamples found to contain ova or larvae, intensity of infectionwere estimated by quantitative analysis of the egg burden,67 according to the Kato-Katz thick-smear technique. Patients who could not produce stool on the spot were provided with sterileplastic containers and asked to bring fresh stool specimen ontheir next clinic visit. Sterile plastic containers were also used tocollect clean-catch urine specimen. Malaria, urine and haemoglobin results were availed to the patient on the same day; other test results were available on the followup visits. Study patients were scheduled follow up visit 14 daysafter initial contact to complete ART eligibility counselling andother assessments. Patients received standard treatments according to infections diagnosed: malaria was treated using Coartem ((artemether20 mg/lumefantrine 120 mg), helminths one and and Schistosomiasis was treated with Praziquantel (40mg/kg divided into 2 doses 6 hours apart). After the 14 th day contact, study patients were scheduled to monthly follow up visits regardless of their ART status. A date for the 6th month follow up visit was communicated to patients during their subsequent clinic visits. Clinical examination andlaboratory procedures performed at initial contact were repeatedat the 6 th month visit. Laboratory proceduresSpecimens for CD4+Tcells, haemoglobin, malaria, sputum, urineand stool samples were analyzed at Tumbi Hospital laboratory.CD4+Tcells analysis was performed using automated FACScount (BD Biosciences, California, USA). Biochemistry andhaematological parameters were (Italy) 80, technique and examined samples were fixed using sodium acetate-acetic (SAF) solution and microscopically examined forparasites microscopic examination wasperformed on urine samples. HIV-1 P24 sample analysis wascarried out based on the Ifakara Health Institute adaptedPerkinElmer Life Sciences's \"P24 Ultra sensitive Assay Protocol\"(ELAST\u00ae kit) (21)]. Data analysis Data was entered into Microsoft \u00aeAccess, and analyzed using Stata Intercooled version 9. Standard definitions of severeimmunological suppression were used in terms of the magnitudeof CD4+Tcells decline. Patients with CD4+Tcells below and above200 cells/\u00b5l were categorized as severely and moderatelyimmunosuppressed. Logistic regression models were used togenerate odds ratios associated with CD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l. Anattempt was made to compare patient groups according to theirspecies specific helminths infection but small samples sizesconstraints limited the ability to draw statistical inferences. Ethical approval The study received scientific and ethical approval from theMuhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences ResearchEthics Review Board (Ref.No.MU/RP/AEC/Vol.XII/58) Permissionwas granted by Region, District and hospital authorities. Informedconsent for participation was obtained from patients usingKiswahili language. Results A total of 464 subjects were enrolled into the study betweenApril 2008 and March 2009, 421 patients provided completebaseline data for analysis. Forty three patients were excludedfrom the analysis because of insufficient samples for69 parasitological diagnosis. Patients excluded did not differ from the remaining patients in terms of socio-demographiccharacteristics, CD4 cell counts and clinical presentation at thetime of enrolment. Baseline characteristics The mean age of participants was 35.7 (SD 34.6 to 36.9) andthe mean body weight was 51.6(SD 50.0 to 53.1). Women werethe majority of patients 261/421(62%). In total 272/421 (64.6%)of patients were living in rural areas and a high proportion of allpatients had primary education 336/421 (80%) with noremarkable differences between patient groups. The majority ofpatients used pit latrine for excreta disposal and obtained waterfor domestic use from mixed sources (Table 5 1). Among the 421 HIV-1 infected patients enrolled with complete data for analysis at initial assessment, 198 (47%) were found tobe co-infected with one or more parasites. Helminths-only co-infection was diagnosed in 93/421 (22.1%) patients, exhibited Plasmodium butno helminths co-infection. Plasmodium sp and helminthsco-infection was diagnosed in 55/421 (13.1%) patients (Table 51Table 5 1: Baseline demographic, social and clinicalcharacteristics of patients by parasites status attended at TumbiHospital and Chalinze Health Centre between April 2008 andMarch 2009 Plasmodium sp was the most common parasite isolated 105/ 421(24.9%). Of the helminths patients harboured one and up to five types of parasites. Multiple parasiteswere diagnosed in 89/421(21.1%) patients. Only one patient wasfound to harbour all five parasites (Table 5 2). At the time of enrolment into the study, more than half of the70 patients were in clinical stages III/IV and had \u00b5l (237/421(56.3%) and was 15.3 (SD 20.3). A higher HIV-1p24 concentration was found in patients with lower CD4 cellcounts and WHO clinical stages III/IV. An additional finding wasthe high concentration of (5.5pg/ml). High concentration of HIV-1 P24 isassociated with rapid HIV-1 disease progression. Effect of parasites co-infection on CD4+Tcells, anaemia and WHO clinical stagesOverall, parasites infected patients had lower CD4 cell countsthan parasites free patients, but this was not statistically significant(Table 5 3). Multiple infection was associated with CD4+Tcells<200/\u00b5l (1 vs. 2 parasites: OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.2-3.5; 1 vs. 3-5parasites: OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.5-10.7) than one parasite co-infection. The test for trend across ordered groups providedconsistently some evidence that the number of parasites isassociated with low CD4+Tcells counts. However, the result wasonly marginally significant (Z = 1.69, p=0.09) (Table 5 2). The associations of CD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l, anaemia (haemoglobin<8.0g/dl) and WHO clinical stage III/IV wereexamined in patients with and without parasites co-infections(Table 5 3). No statistical significant differences were observedbetween patients with and without parasites co-infection inassociation with CD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l. The adjusted odds ratiosfor parasites co-infected patients were less than one, except forpatients with mixed malaria and helminths, any helminths,strongyloides and Ascaris lumbricoides only infections (OR=1.2, 1.6, 1.5 and 2.2 respectively). The prevalence of anaemia was higher 64/198(32.5%) in parasite co-infected compare to 42/223(18.8%) in patients without co-71 infection. Parasites co-infection was associated with significant risk of anaemia (AOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.3 to 3.2). The odds of havinganaemia were high in patients with mixed helminths and malariainfection, increased by a factor of more than 3 (AOR=3.8, 95%CI 1.9 to 7.1) compared to patients without co-infection. Therewas a strong association between Ascaris lumbricoides and anaemia (AOR=5.3, 95%CI 1.8 to 15.7). Patients with any of thehelminths infection had almost two times higher odds of havinganaemia (AOR 1.9, 95%CI (1.1-3.3). Similarly, patients co-infected with hookworm had two times higher odds (AOR=2.1,95% CI 0.9-6.7) to have severe anaemia; however, thisassociation was not statistically significant. The associationsbetween either Strongyloides stercoralis or Schistosomiasis and anaemia were affected by small samples and did not demonstrateany statistically significant association with haematobium causes Neither multiple co-infection with any with single infection (AOR 0.8-1.7, 95%CI 0.4-5.2) was significantly associated with WHO clinical stagesIII/IV. Changes in CD4+Tcell counts after treatment Of the 421 patients for whom complete data were available atbaseline analysis, one patient died and 18 patients were infectedor re-infected with parasites during the 6 months follow-up period.At the end of 6 months follow-up, 196 (98.9%) of those withparasites and 222 (99.6%) of those without parasites at enrolmentwere attended and had complete data for analysis. In total312(74.1%) patients were started on ART during the period. We observed an increase in CD4+Tcell counts at six months on majority of ART patients with and those without parasites (Table5 4). Patients with parasites at baseline 151/196(77.0%)experienced increase in CD4+Tcell counts, the majority of whom72 were those with ART treatment 129/151(85.4%). Similarly, for patients without parasites co-infection, 147/222(66.2%) hadCD4+Tcell counts increased and majority 125/147 (85.0%) treatment. The mean CD4+Tcell counts increasewas 111.6(9.0) and 108.6(8.2) in patients with and withoutparasite infection at baseline respectively. The CD4+Tcell counts decreased between enrolment and 6 months follow-up in 45/196(22.9%) and 75/222(33.7%) patientswith and without parasites, respectively. The mean CD4+Tcellcounts decrease was 109.3(SD 14.9) and 101.2(SD 29.9) inpatients with and without parasites, respectively. Statistical significant difference was observed between patients with parasites co-infection who experienced CD4+Tcell countsincrease and those whose CD4+Tcell counts decreased(p=0.001). Similar results were observed in patients withoutparasites. Variables known to be associated with CD4 cell count changes, were included in multivariable logistic regression analysis,baseline CD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l was significantly (AOR associated with CD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l at six months (Table5 5). New infections with helminths or malaria were not associatedwith CD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l at six months (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 0.4-5.7). This is probably because of low parasite infection intensityto impact on CD4+ T-cell changes within the follow up period.The impact of P24 and WHO clinical stages in predictingCD4+Tcells <200/\u00b5l at six months was obviously influenced bythe initiation of ART (AOR 1.0, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.6). Discussion This study found malaria and helminths co-infection morefrequent in HIV-infected patients than other parasites. Theprevalence rate of helminths was 22.1% lower than study findingsin other sub-Saharan African settings(22) (23) but higher than73 results from studies in other rural Tanzania (24) (25). We isolated frequently hookworm, A. lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis in patients \u00b5/l not the common HIV-related protozoa which marked early AIDSmanifestation as causes of chronic diarrhoea. These findingscould be setting specific or a phenomenon of changing AIDSmanifestation because previous studies have reported higherprevalence rates of Cryptosporidium and Isospora belli among HIV-infected patients (22) (26). The prevalence of malaria co-infection in our study population was 24.9% higher than findings of previous studies in EasternAfrica (27) (9). The high malaria parasitaemia in this and otherprevious studies points to an important interaction between HIV-1 and malaria especially in our setting where large population ofsevere immunodeficiency patients and endemic malaria coexist.Malaria is known to cause transitory higher viral load while HIV-1 causes more clinical malaria, higher parasitaemia and higherrates of treatment failure in co-infected patients (5) (28). Mixed parasites infection is common in areas where various types of parasites coexist with favourable behavioural and ecologicalpatterns for transmission. The occurrence of polyparasitism inthe current study showed an inverse relationship with CD4-Tcells<200 \u00b5/l. Health effects of polyparasitism depends on thetypes of parasites co-infection, mixed intestinal bring persistent diarrhoea and anaemia. mixed helminths malaria infection, malaria can worsenmild anaemia due to helminths and impact on HIV-infectionoutcome. Although this study did show only a marginalstatistically significant trend towards severe immunodeficiencyas a result of polyparasitism, it highlights an important interactionespecially in settings with higher prevalence of HIV-1 andparasites infection. Therefore parasites co-infection in HIV andAIDS patients should not be ignored given the availability ofvarious reports pointing towards negative health outcomes. Site74 specific assessment need to be carried out to determine the relevant and abundance of parasites to that particular area toform the bases for intervention approaches. It is well established that CD+T-cell<200 \u00b5/l is associated with high risk of opportunistic infection and poor disease progression(29). On the other hand parasites co-infection facilitates CD4+T-cells decline (12) through various mechanisms. This study diddemonstrate a statistical significant association between multipleparasites co-infections and CD+T-cell <200 \u00b5/l before treatment,and the odds ratios tended to show some association. Therefore,parasites co-infection increases the risk of opportunistic infectionin HIV-infected patients. Then, this study finding gives theindication of a possible strong association in settings with highinfection intensities and their impact on CD4+ T-cell decline. The association of helminths and CD+T-cell <200 \u00b5/l in this study was also affected by the low intensities of helminths infectionand re-infection that occurred after treatment. An attempt wasmade to analyze each individual helminths species effects butthe samples were insufficiently small to provide basis forinference. Parasite re-infection and failure to control for theduration of infection complicated the estimation of the true effectsof helminths on CD4+ T cells decline and clinical manifestations.It is difficult to determine the duration of infection until theoccurrence of CD4+Tcells decline. Cohort studies in differentsettings of high and low parasite prevalence intensities canprovide adequate information on the specific interaction ofhelminths and HIV-infection. Health seeking behaviour is one ofthe important factors to be considered as cofounders in the roleof helminths co-infection in CD4+Tcell decline. Late presentationis a common phenomenon in this setting, a majority of patientsgoes to seek health care after having advancedimmunodeficiency. Thus, making it difficult to establish whichthe cause was and effect between helminths infection andCD4+Tcell decline.75 Our study population consisted of patients exposed to the common known risk factors for helminths infection transmission;largely involved persons with primary level education, limitedaccess to safe water supply; and used pit latrine, and some didnot use any latrine. Therefore human faeces pollution and highrates of transmission of soil transmitted helminths is evident inthis population. Improved sanitation combined with de-wormingprograms is likely to eliminate helminths transmission. Althoughthe current de-worming programs are focused on school childrenwith the highest burden of helminths infection, the prevalence ofhelminths in adults is also substantial because of the shift toadult population (30). Routine mass treatment in HIV-infectedpersons can be beneficial and provides an appropriate alternativepublic health approach to routine screening and treatmentespecially in regions with high burden of helminths. Anaemia is a common complication which occurs in 20-80% of HIV-infected patients and is associated with rapid diseaseprogression and mortality (31). The prevalence of anaemia inour study was significantly associated with any of the parasitesco-infections. The impact of parasites co-infection on anaemiawas more significant in patients with malaria and helminthspolyparasitism such an association was not demonstrated inpatients without parasites co-infection. HIV-infection can lead toanaemia in many ways in HIV-infected patients (32). Our resultsshow the additive effects of parasites co-infection on other causesof anaemia in HIV-infected patients. In areas where HIV-infection,helminths and anaemia are prevalent, the interaction of anaemiaand helminths or malaria in HIV-infection need to be emphasizeddespite of inadequate diagnosis facilities. In such settings somepatients, even when HIV-replication is controlled by ART, maycontinue to experience poor health due to anaemia secondaryto parasites infection. Increased CD4+Tcells susceptibility to HIV-infection caused by helminths co-infection was demonstrated by finding of a strong76 association between helminths co-infection and higher HIV-1 P24 antigen concentrations. This positive association can beexplained by the in vivo activation of CD4 +Tcells to >5pg/ml predictsdisease progression comparable to CD4+T-cells<350/\u00b5l (33), wefound higher HIV-1 P24 antigen concentration in parasites co-infected patients and majority of them needed ART for survival.These findings are contrary to previous reports that showedhigher viral loads in helminths free participants (34). A noticeable increase in CD4+Tcells was recorded in both parasites co-infected and uninfected patients between enrolmentand at 6 months. This change cannot be exclusively associatedwith treatment of helminths and malaria parasites. Our patientswere given Cotrimoxazole and ARVs together with treatment ofparasites. A statistical significant difference in CD4+Tcellsincrease was observed between the parasites co-infected anduninfected patients. This was because; a higher patients had CD+T-cell <200 \u00b5/l and startedearlier ART compared to uninfected patients. Therefore,helminths or parasites co-infection treatment benefits are moreexpressed if combined with ART and Cotrimoxazole. Cohortstudies comparing very high and very low parasite intensities inHIV-1 co-infected patients can provide useful information on theminimum essential burden of parasites responsible for CD4+ T-cells changes. Conclusion We have looked at one set of parasites and found highprevalence of malaria and helminths co-infection. Given theavailable various reports on parasites co-infection in HIV andAIDS patients, parasites should not be ignored in HIV and AIDSprograms. Incorporation of these programs should not wait the77 conclusion of the ongoing debate on de-worm or not de-worm. Instead, parasites co-infection in HIV-infected patients' areaspecific prevalence data can be used confidently to guideprogram approaches. In low parasite prevalence settings routinediagnostic screening is recommended and settings with highparasites prevalence mass treatment should be considered.

Lacking CD4counts facilities in rural health facilities remains a challenge.Simplified and sensitive clinical staging based on local clinicalpatterns is useful to ensure effective care without CD4 counts. Objectives To assess whether HIV local-based clinical manifestations canbe used to guide HIV management in settings with limited accessto CD4 counts in Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional study conducted at Tumbi and Chalinze healthfacilities, Tanzania, documented clinical manifestations and CD4counts in 360 HIV/AIDS patients. High frequency manifestationswere used to predict level of immunosuppression with CD4counts results as 'Gold standard'. Simplified management groupscomprised of severe and moderate disease stages were formedbased on clinical manifestations and CD4 counts. Results Weight loss (48.3%) and chronic cough (40.8%) were the mostreported manifestation in the study population; followed by. Mostsymptoms were found to be highly specific (ranging from 56.4%of weight loss to 98.6% of the combination of cough, diarrhoeaand difficult in breathing) with high positive predictive values(ranging from 56.8% of fatigue to 90% of the combination ofcough, diarrhoea and difficult in breathing) in predicting severeimmunosuppression. Chronic diarrhoea presented in 10.6% ofpatients, and predicted well severe immunosuppression eitheralone or in combination with other symptoms (with high likelihoodratios ranging from 1.83 to 3.27 at 95%CI). Headache, skin andfungal diseases presented highly but relatively weak in predicting91 immunosuppression. Although, the combination of three symptoms predicted well WHO stages III/IV with high specificityand positive predictive values had low sensitivity. The sensitivityof all the presenting symptoms remained lower than 52%, andwas not improved by including more signs and symptoms in theanalysis. Conclusions HIV/AIDS clinics managing large cohorts should review andvalidate site specific HIV clinical manifestation in comparisonwith CD4 counts and WHO clinical stages. Based on localexperiences simplified guidelines are useful for resourceconstrained settings without CD4 counting facilities.92 Introduction In sub-Saharan Africa, the transmission of HumanImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) occurs mostly throughheterosexual contact and the progression to AcquiredImmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and premature death is thereality for people in most poor areas with limited access toAntiretroviral Therapy (ART) [ 1, 2,3]. HIV disease progressesfrom an asymptomatic period of variable duration, through mildsymptoms, to severe disease characteristic of cellularimmunodeficiency [1]. Human Immunodeficiency Virus clinical presentation is known to be complex since AIDS was described in 1981[2, 3]. HIV canmanifest in a variety of ways depending on the organs affectedand concurrent infections prevalent in the area. The initial clinicalpresentation may mimic symptoms of common endemic diseasesin that particular region [4, 5] However, the severity ofmanifestation depends on the infected individual's baseline healthstatus. The most significant early manifestation of HIV infectionin Africa was marked by slim disease (diarrhoea and wasting);tuberculosis; variety of Opportunistic Infections (OI); weight loss,fever; and dermatological symptoms[2,5,6]. With the exceptionof tuberculosis which continues to increase, other AIDS relateddiseases are declining gradually due to the widespread use ofOI drugs. World Health Organization (WHO) has established a four stage clinical classification system determined by the presence ofOpportunistic Infections and other HIV related conditions [7] . This classification tried to incorporate most of the AIDS-definingillnesses occurring in all regions of the world making a globaltool for HIV/AIDS patients care and treatment. It has been avery useful tool in Sub Saharan Africa at the introduction ofantiretroviral drugs and establishment of HIV/AIDS treatmentcohorts [8]. It helped to capture rapid deteriorating patients and93 initiation of ART in settings with limited diagnostic resources and less trained clinicians. Antiretroviral drugs are widely available nowadays and continue to be scaled up in remote rural areas of sub Saharan Africa [9,10]. The aim of rapid scale up is to reach more people living withHIV and AIDS who cannot easily access ART services in urbanhospitals. The main challenges to this plausible strategy includeavailability of qualified health workers and laboratory services toensure quality care and the monitoring of drug use [11-13]. Inaddition, most patients including HIV-infected patients in SubSaharan Africa present late for hospital care and treatment whenthe disease has advanced [13-15]. By then initial AIDS signsand symptoms might have been treated empirically through selfmedication or use of herbal medicines. Such remedial actionsusually obscure important AIDS clinical features and make itdifficult for the attending clinician to solicit signs and symptomsto properly stage the patient. It is evident that HIV/AIDS patients' management in Sub Saharan Africa continues to be guided primarily by clinical staging [8, 16, 17] owing to the insufficient availability and/or frequentbreakdowns of CD4 cells count machines, shortage of qualifiedmedical personnel and laboratory reagents and other logisticissues and challenges [18]. On the other hand WHO clinicalstaging depends on a patient presenting signs and symptoms;knowledge and skills of the health care worker to make a definitivestaging [8,17,19]. Furthermore, WHO clinical staging is lesssensitive in identifying patients with CD4 cell counts between200 -350 cells per \u00b5L [4, 20] . Therefore, it fails to identify some patients in need of ART. Taking into considerations the complexities of HIV clinical manifestation in our setting which often does not match WHOclinical staging. Clinicians in lower health facilities, who areexpected to attend to HIV patients in their local settings, need94 simplified and easy to use clinical staging guidelines developed by utilizing site specific data and clinical experiences. Thisapproach could effectively support management of HIV/AIDSpatients in ART cohorts based on site specific experiences.Moreover, the broader availability of ART as well as newapproaches to deal with opportunistic infections call for a reviewof the clinical presentations seen within care and treatmentprograms in different settings. To date, no studies have proposedsimplified HIV/AIDS clinical staging based on local experience.With the inspiration of WHO validated HIV/AIDS clinical definition,our study aimed at developing simplified HIV/AIDS clinical stagingsystem based on data generated locally from peri-urban andrural health facilities to allow more effective patient managementand ART cohorts at peripheral level in the absence of CD4 counts. Methods Setting and study participants The study was conducted at Tumbi Regional Hospital andChalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region, Eastern Tanzaniabetween April and December 2008. Tumbi Regional Hospital islocated 40 km from Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital ofTanzania. The hospital has a bed capacity of 200 beds and servesas a regional referral Hospital. Chalinze Health Centre is located70 km from Tumbi Hospital at the junction of the main upcountryhighways with HIV prevalence of 15%. The Pwani Region HIVprevalence is 7%. Both facilities provide services to a mixture ofpatients from urban and rural villages. Most residents of Chalinzereside in rural villages and generate income from farming andtrading of different types of goods. Tumbi Hospital runs two separate HIV/AIDS clinics for adults and children since 2007. At the time of initiation of this study inApril 2008, Tumbi Hospital had enrolled a total of 3851 patients95 to care and treatment. And Chalinze Health Centre had enrolled a total of 450 patients to care and treatment. The inclusion criteria for our study population included those aged 15 and above years; permanent residence to the healthfacility catchments area; and first time enrolment to care andtreatment services; no prior use of ARVs and or co-trimoxazoleprophylaxis. A total of 360 female and male patients consented to participate in the study. Recruitment of study participants lasted for 3 months.The current recommended ARV combination regimen for adultsand adolescent include:AZT + 3TC+NVP or EFV,D4T+3TC+NVP/EFVTDF+FTC+NVP/EFVTDF+3TC+NVP/EFV Data collection Each consenting patient was clinically examined in the standardway that involved a detailed history, physical examination andlaboratory tests. Additional laboratory tests depended on thesuspected diagnosis. Patients' socio-demographic characteristicsand clinical information were recorded in a structured report formin addition to routine patient case report forms. Laboratory procedures Blood, sputum, urine and stool samples were collected andanalyzed. Blood samples were analyzed for CD4 cell counts,HIV-1 P24 plasma ELISA assay, haemoglobin, liver and renalfunction tests. Blood was collected in EDTA tubes for enumerationof CD4 cells by using (Pentra France) respectively. Thick Giemsa stained and microscopically examined for Malariaparasitaemia [21]. Sputum specimens were stained using Neelsen technique and examined for mycobacterium tuberculosis [22]. Stool samples were fixed using sodium acetate-acetic acid- formalin (SAF) solution and microscopically examined forintestinal parasites. Part of freshly passed Shigella species. direct microscopicexamination was performed on urine samples. This paperfocuses on CD4 cell counts results in comparison to the WHOclinical staging. Data analysis All data was entered into Microsoft \u00aeAccess, and analyzed usingStata Intercooled version 9. Each clinical symptom or sign was coded and counted individually to estimate the frequency of occurrences from every patient.About 140 different signs and symptoms were recorded. Thefrequencies were then used to estimate the proportion of patientswith that particular sign or symptom. Using CD4 count results and a cutoff point of 350 cells/\u00b5L patients were categorized into two management groups of severeimmunosuppression (CD4+ T-lymphocytes counts below 350cells per \u00b5L) and T-lymphocytes counts above 350 cells per \u00b5L). In addition,presented signs and symptoms were used to perform WHOstaging. Based on clinical manifestations of the study patients,we determined the probability of each symptom/sign alone or incombination of up to three to predict severe immunosuppressionand WHO clinical stages III/IV. The probability were determinedin terms of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihoodratio using CD4 cells count level as the \"gold standard\". Only97 symptoms which had high frequency and troubled the patient for more than two weeks were used. Ethical approval The study received scientific and ethical approval from theMuhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences ResearchEthics Review Board (Ref.No.MU/RP/AEC/Vol.XII/58).Permission was granted by Region, District and hospitalauthorities. Verbal informed consent for participation wasobtained from patients using local Kiswahili language. Results Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics In total, 360 HIV-infected patients consented to participate in thestudy and 331(91.9%) patients provided complete data foranalysis. Majority of the patients resided in rural areas223(67.4%), the others were from semi-urban areas. The medianCD4+ T-lymphocytes counts was 84(IQR patients withsevere immunosuppression comprising of 68(35.6%) males and123(64.4%) females. The median age was comparable in bothgroups of patients with severe or moderate immunosuppression.Patients classified with WHO clinical stage III/IV, 60(42.9%) hadmoderate immunosuppression and 54(28.3%) I/II had severe immunosuppression. Patient's main presenting symptoms and signs at recruitmentFrequencies of the most recorded symptoms and signs areshown in Table 6 2. We report symptoms and signs that persistedfor more than two weeks. Weight loss of more than 5 kg was themost frequent 160(48.3%), followed by chronic cough98 135(40.8%). Diarrhoea was less common 35(10.6%) in this study population. Recurrent fever was recorded in 132(39.8%) of thepatients; other symptoms with high frequency included headache105(31.7%); Peripheral neuropathy 57(17.2%) and fatigue88(26.6%). patients had various types of skin diseases, butPruritic Papular Eruptions was the most common dermatologicalcondition. Thirty six (11%) patients presented with genitaldischarge; 12(33%) of them had sexually transmitted infections.In addition to major clinical symptoms and signs; 132 (37%)patients presented with mild non-specific various clinical features.Major clinical features to predict severe immunosuppressionIn Table 6 2, Table 6 3 and Table 6 4 the performance of eachAIDS presenting symptom alone or in combination with othersymptoms in predicting severe immunosuppression isdemonstrated. The sensitivities of single main complain werebelow 50% except for weight loss of more than 5% and headachewhich was 51.8%. However, the specificity of most symptomswas high with fungal infection and chronic diarrhoea presentingthe highest specificities of 93.6% and 92.9% respectively.Sensitivity declined with higher combination of major symptomsper patient (Table 6 3 and Table 6 4). However, the PositivePredictive values (probability of correct diagnosis) for severeimmunosuppression increased with higher combination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhoea had about two times more likely to have severe immunosuppression (Likelihood ratio1.83, 95%CI 0.91 to 3.69). Diarrhoea is an important predictorof severe immunosuppression even when presenting in99 combination with other major symptoms (Likelihood ratio ranging from 1.78 to 4.03, for two and three combination of symptoms). Most of the symptoms documented as single or in combination with other symptoms had likelihood ratio of greater than oneindicating their association with severe immunosuppression.Whereas the likelihood ratio of headache (0.98, 95%CI 0.71-1.34), fatigue (0.96, 95%CI fatigue (0.87, 95%CI 0.51-1.49) were lessthan one indicating lack of association with severeimmunosuppression. Since most of the symptoms recorded are not part of the list of clinical conditions used to determine WHO clinical staging, wedetermined the diagnostic properties of combination of threesigns and or symptoms. The results in Table 6 5 show an attemptto use combination of three symptoms to allocate patients intoWHO clinical stages III/IV. The sensitivities ranged from4.6%(combination of cough, diarrhoea and difficult in breathing)to 37.3% (combination of cough, fever, weight loss) however thepredictive values were above 80%, indicating the high probabilityof correct allocation of patients to WHO stages III/IV if presentedwith multiple combination of major signs and symptoms. Thelikelihood ratios were greater than 2 in all the three combinationsindicating that it is useful to use these combinations to clinicallyclassify patients into WHO stages III/IV. Discussion This study attempted to explore the extent to which HIV/AIDSpresenting symptoms at a given location could be used to screenpatients with severe immunosuppression and eventually decideappropriate model of care for HIV-infected patients in settingswith limited access to CD4 counts. Since the number of HIV/AIDS patients with unusual clinical presentations continues toincrease due to viral mutations, self medications withOpportunistic Infection drugs and use of local herbs practices100 which mask the known classical HIV/AIDS manifestations. Review of clinical manifestations and development of validatedHIV-clinical staging that maximize both sensitivity and specificitytailored to a particular geographical and endemic area incomparison to the well established WHO-staging should beencouraged. The clinical profiles of about 34% of the study patients were unique and obscured not fitting with WHO clinical criteria, whichin turn resulted in WHO staging that was inconsistent with theirCD4 cell counts. The majority of the patients presented withclinical features of weight loss (and wasting); chronic cough; andpersistent fever for more than 2 weeks. These are commonsymptoms and signs which were described as early HIVmanifestation and were significantly associated with sero-conversion in the first decades of HIV epidemic [23, 24] andwere among the bases of WHO staging together with presenceof opportunistic infection. We also, observed a marked shift inAIDS clinical manifestation from the classical AIDS clinicalmanifestations [23] which previously was marked by profoundweight loss of more than 10% body weight; chronic diarrhoeaand prolonged fever to a mixed picture of signs and symptoms[23-25]. Although, our patients had reported weight loss, theweight loss was limited to more than 5 kg and less than 5%(data not shown) of their initial body weight. The clinical spectrumseen among the patients in both study sites are quiterepresentative to the current overall clinical pictures of the HIV/AIDS patients in the area. The two sites are the only care andtreatment centres in the whole area. Interestingly, only 10.6% of the patients presented with chronic diarrhoea which indicates a marked reduction in occurrence ofdiarrhoea among HIV/AIDS patients. Diarrhoea was well knownto affect between 40% and 80% of HIV infected persons andwas also associated with high mortality rates in Sub-SaharanAfrica [24, 26, 27]. The reduction in prevalence of diarrhoea in101 HIV infected people can be explained by the now broader availability of OIs drugs and co-trimoxazole without prescription. Working at care and treatment centres, we recruited newlydiagnosed HIV patients that were all included in the ART cohortsaccording to the national control programme. We expected torecord more pre-AIDS signs and symptoms such as generalizedlymphadenopathy, Herpes zoster and mucocutaneous lesions.Instead, one third of our patients presented with minor non-specific and often no symptoms. While, at the same time aboutone third of the patients had CD4 cell counts less than 350 cellsper \u00b5L. Herpes zoster was diagnosed in 5% of patients, most ofthem had CD4 cell counts below 200 cells per \u00b5L which is contraryto the common believe that Herpes zoster is a stage II disease.It is a reality in most rural, poor communities to accept a HIV testafter suffering for a long time and tried on all kinds of remedieswithout success. During this time their CD4 cell countsprogressively declined. Most of the known common HIV related opportunistic infections were less frequent than expected in this population despite manypatients having CD4 cell counts less than 350 cells per \u00b5L. It iswell established that patients at this level of CD4 cell countshave high risk of AIDS opportunistic infections and AIDS relatedcancers [28]. Tuberculosis was diagnosed in only 15% of thepatients despite the high frequency of chronic cough and difficultyin breathing. Patients with extra pulmonary tuberculosis andPneumocystis carinii pneumonia could be missed due to limited respective diagnostic facilities. The diagnosis of these diseaseswas based on sputum and chest x-ray findings. In routinepractice, tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients requires regularscreening at every visit because single screening does notexclude latent infection that can flare up in the course of HIVdisease progression. Cryptococcus meningitis and Kaposi's sarcoma were diagnosed in only 3% of the patients. However, the lower rate of HIV related102 cancers can be due to the small sample size of this study. Overall, the different clinical patterns and frequencies of opportunisticinfections may largely be due to changed approaches in theclinical management brought forward by (i) the broader availabilityof ART in combination with the establishment of care andtreatment centres as part of the national control program and (ii)the new approaches to handle prophylactically andtherapeutically opportunistic infections also outside the nationalHIV/AIDS control program. Patients with moderate immunosuppression are symptomatically expected to fit in WHO stages I/II whilst those with severe diseaseto be stages III/IV and vise versa. However, according to theirCD4 cell counts, 29% and 49% of patients in clinical stages Iand II were supposed to be in WHO clinical stages III or IVrespectively. Similarly, 37% and 25% of patients in WHO clinicalstages III and IV respectively, were supposed to be in WHOclinical stages I or II respectively. The level of incorrectclassification found in this study is almost similar to Ugandanexperiences where about 50% of patients were inappropriatelystaged [20]. In routine clinical practice WHO clinical stages determine the direction of case management. Patients in clinicalstages I and II usually receive long time appointmentsaccompanied by minimum laboratory investigations. While,patients in clinical stages III and IV usually receive clinical andlaboratory assessment to determine their eligibility to start ART.Therefore, when a sizable proportion of patients cannot be stagedcorrectly at first contact in ART clinics, the initiation of ART isdelayed and higher mortality rates can be expected in the firstthree months of ART [13]. More than half of our patients were in WHO clinical stages III and IV which was consistent to the number of patients with CD4cell counts of less than 350 cells per \u00b5L. This is the reality of latepresentation and a challenge to ART programs. Using the cutoff point for severe immunosuppression of CD4 cell counts <350103 cells per \u00b5L, comparison is more conservative based on the Tanzania Care and Treatment Guidelines [16]. Taking intoconsideration the high proportion of patients presenting late withobscured clinical features to care and treatment for the first time,it appears advantageous to classify patients based on localunderstanding of HIV-disease manifestations and to have at leastone CD4 count measurement before initiation of ART. Such anapproach simplifies the process of clinical management andreduces the chances of missing appropriate staging and henceavoid delays in starting ART can be avoided. In our study, skin diseases and fungal infections of the skin and mucous membranes indicated severe immunosuppression witha low sensitivity (10.9% and 7.9% respectively). Similarly, thesesymptoms were weak predictors of severe immunodeficiencybased on CD4 decline. Although these symptoms are frequentlydiagnosed cannot be used to categorize level ofimmunosuppression. Most of the symptoms showed lowsensitivity in predicting severe immunosuppression and a highrisk of false negative results, thus many patients with CD4<350can be missed if these symptoms are used in routine clinicalmanagement. However, these symptoms were highly specificand high positive predictive values which increased with thenumber of symptom combinations for severeimmunosuppression. Therefore the presence of combination ofHIV-specific clinical symptoms in a patient can be used to initiateART. Based on these study findings, exclusive use of WHO clinical staging of HIV/AIDS patients to decide appropriate model of care,remains a challenge for clinicians working in settings with limitedaccess to CD4 counts. The absence of clinical illness in fittingwith WHO clinical stages cannot be used to rule out the need forART. We then recommend use of HIV-specific symptoms basedon local experiences to classify HIV-infected patients into severeand moderate immunosuppression based on duration of clinical104 manifestations. This classification guided by local clinical experience - requires further validation. But for patients withunusual HIV-disease presentation estimation of CD4 counts isstill needed to decide model of care. We recognize the smallsample size used in this study as a limitation. However thecomposition of patients from rural and urban settings impliesthat the guidelines established can be used at a regional level.Therefore and besides our current own efforts, more studiesshould be conducted to validate the proposed approach ofstaging, not only for patients' classification but also for monitoringdrug side effects and treatment failure in other geographical andendemic settings. Conclusion The broader availability of HIV/AIDS treatment as well as newapproaches to deal with opportunistic infections, we call for areview of the clinical presentations seen within care and treatmentprograms in different settings. Besides applying the WHO clinicalstaging care and treatment centres that look after large cohortsof HIV and AIDS patients information should also develop andvalidate site specific guidelines based on local clinicalexperiences.

Non-adherence is one of the majorcauses of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidityand mortality caused by Opportunistic Infections. Optimal ARTadherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replicationand long term survival of patients. In order to develop effectivepublic health interventions in the context of scaling ART servicesto rural areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated withnon-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in rural areas.The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence in rural and semi-urban settings of Tanzania. Methods A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital andChalinze Health centre. A structured questionnaire was used toassess adherence to doses instruction and time schedule.Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as caseswhile those with more than 95% adherence became controls. Astructured questionnaire containing factors known to beassociated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings wasadministered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logisticregression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. Results A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sexwere studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2%and 84.8%) had good knowledge of ART benefits, adherenceand eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%)used public transport to access ART services. More than half ofcases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of fare or117 other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosureto confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive statuswere associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated (mOR1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7) with non adherence to ART. Patients whowere not satisfied with providers were more likely to be nonadherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). Conclusions These findings show that adherence is a dynamic process thatvaries depending on region or cohort specific adherence factors.Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specificadherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns. Background Tanzania like many other sub-Saharan countries with anestimated 2 million persons living with HIV and AIDS has thegreatest burden of disease [1], [2]. The prevalence is estimatedat 5.7% in the population segment aged 15-49 years old withwomen being highly affected than men [3]. The epidemic showsregional variations and urban residents have considerably higherinfection levels at 10.9% compared with rural residents 5.2%[4]. Tanzania benefited from the Global fund for HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis fund; SDC fund coupled with the U.S.APresidential Emergence Fund for AIDS which were madeavailable in 2004. The National response to HIV and AIDS addedcare and treatment in the prevention interventions package [5]. The Government of Tanzania introduced the HIV and AIDS care and treatment program with the aim of prolonging the lives ofPLHA, to restore their mental and physical functions and toimprove quality of life [1]. Through the National AIDS Control118 Program, the MOH Tanzania adopted a stepwise approach to scale up antiretroviral therapy (ART) services in the country. Apilot HIV/AIDS care and Treatment clinic was started in late 2004at Muhimbili National Hospital, which was then followed byestablishment of similar clinics in zonal and regional hospitals.A model integrated care and treatment HIV-clinic was establishedat Ifakara Hospital in April 2005 to document experiences andchallenges of providing ART in rural settings through appliedresearch [6]. This careful rather cautious approach was aimedat establishing capacity to provide training and supervision rolesto the lower facilities. However, due to increased demand forAntiretroviral therapy in all parts of the country a quick rapid scaleup strategy was implemented with support from Non-GovernmentOrganizations (NGO). HIV and AIDS care and treatment clinicswere established in selected rural health centres with largevolume of patients. ART has substantially decreased morbidity and mortality rates for those with HIV-infection in developed and developingcountries like Tanzania [7]. The use of simpler ARV fixed dosecombination regimens have overcome the prescriptioncomplexities. Thus, lower level health providers can prescribeARVs after short term training. Concerns about poor adherence to combination antiretroviral drugs (ARV) among patients living in resource limited settingshave been an important consideration in expanding the accessto ART [8]. Mainly due to possibility of poor adherence totreatment because of inadequate resources and ARV prescriptionrequirements that the drugs are taken on time, every time andside effects are managed accordingly [9]. Poor adherence toART is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leadsto increases in morbidity and mortality caused by infection withopportunistic diseases [10], [11]. Good adherence to ART isessential for maximal suppression of viral replication, avoidanceof resistance and long term survival of patients [12], [13], [2],119 [14]. A minimum of 95% compliance is needed to achieve the desired virologic outcomes [15], [12]. Many studies have examined adherence to ART in resource limited settings with varied results due to differences in socio-cultural and socio-economical contexts of the populations beingstudied [16]. Several factors have been found to be associatedwith sub optimal adherence to treatment. Medication factorssuch as dosing frequencies and higher daily pill numbers werehighly associated with poor adherence especially before thedevelopment of fixed dose combination [15]. Fixed dose ARVscombinations (FDC) have reduced the number of pills and thefrequency of intake is reduced to twice daily. In most resourcelimited settings commonly use Nevirapine-based HAART with HAART deliveredas FDC is convenient to take, easy to adhere to, potent, welltolerated, and reserves future treatment options in case of drugfailure [17] . Adverse drug side effects, lower level of patient education andlittle experience with HIV/AIDS symptoms are strongly associatedwith non adherence to treatment in some settings [18], [19].Understanding of adverse drug side effects can be a challengein setting with limited laboratory diagnosis, presence of infectionwith similar clinical manifestation and low level of education likemost of the rural areas in sub Saharan Africa. Good adherence to ART has been shown in sub Saharan Africa [20], [21], though cannot be generalized to all settings. In somerural areas where food is scarce and patients have to travel longdistances to seek care, adherence to dietary instructions andtime intervals between doses can result into sub optimaladherence to ART [22] [23]. Among the psychosocial attributes related to non adherence to ART include lack of social support, depression, active substance120 abuse and alcohol use, stigma and fear of disclosure of HIV sero status [24], [25], [26]. A rapid increase in HIV-1 prevalence and testing awareness among people living in rural and semi-urban communities hasbeen seen in Tanzania [27]. Rural populations have limited healthcare and social service resources. They typically report difficultiesin accessing appropriate health care including HIV care andtreatment services. Rural communities are classified as \"closed\"where social ties and networks are very strong. The nature ofthese networks decreases the possibility of the likelihood ofdisclosure since information is likely to spread fast, then potentialfor stigmatization and marginalization following disclosure [28],[22]. However these social networks are also useful in providingsocial and emotional support for People Living With HIV andAIDS (PLWHA). Adherence study findings in Tanzania are more likely to be different between urban and rural or semi-urban settings becausemost HIV care and treatment clinics are well established in urbansettings. Rural environments have different demographic,socioeconomic and cultural characteristics. In order to developeffective public health interventions in the context of scaling ARTservices to rural areas, it is important to evaluate factorsassociated with non adherence among HIV-infected individualsresiding in rural areas. The purpose of this study was to identifyfactors related to non adherence to ART in rural and semi-urbansettings of Tanzania. Patients and Methods The study was conducted at Tumbi regional hospital and Chalinzehealth centre in Coast region between May 2008 and November2008. Majority of the inhabitants of the hospital and health centrecatchments areas are subsistence farmers and traders. Theyoriginated from different ethnic groups and are mainly Islam orChristians.121 Since adherence to ART in most poor resource settings has been reported to be more than 95%, ascertainment of factors relatedto non-adherence is difficult. Therefore understanding thesecircumstances a case-control study design was chosen to bethe best and applied. We recruited adult patients aged 18-75 years old, who had been on ART for more than three months and agreed to participate inthe interviews. The process of identification and selection of nonadherence patients (Cases) and adherent (controls) involved useof pharmacy drug refill records. Patients with one or more misseddrug refills in the past three months were listed and contactedfor interviews. A structured questionnaire consisting questionson adherence to doses in the past 1-4 days, within the past week;adherence to time schedule; and the 30 days visual analogyscale (VAS) was used to determine the level of adherence toART. Adherence to doses was calculated as doses taken overthose prescribed. Adherence levels assessed using VAS wasdefined as full adherence if the patient marked 9.5 mm (95%) to10 mm (100%) and non-adherence marked less than 9.5 mm(<95%) of the prescribed doses taken since last refill. Onlypatients who were found non adherence to all by less than 95%were defined as non-adherence cases. A total of 79 non-adherence patients were identified, and consented to participatein the study and matched by age and sex to three adherentcontrols.122 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for cases and controls # Time assumed adequate for patients to be familiar with providers and services at the clinic*Time assumed to be adequate for patients to have experienced ART toxicity and side effects Data collection A structured questionnaire was administered to all cases andcontrols during a scheduled appointment or routine clinic visits.The questionnaire was constructed using factors found to beassociated with poor adherence to ART in similar settings in sub-Saharan Africa [23], [29], [30]. The key risk factors testedincluded: stigma, knowledge, provider-patient interaction, andselected social and behaviour factors. The questionnaire coveredsocio-demographic characteristics, social and behaviour factors.Eight items were developed to assess perceive availability ofsocial support to cover four themes: emotional support(confidant), financial support, counselling and care during criticalstate. Depression was assessed using a ten items questionnaireadopted from the version of the Centres for Epidemiologic StudiesDepression Scale (CES-D) accessible at http:// www .chcr .brown.edu/pcoc/cesdscale.p df. Two groups of knowledge was assessed, knowledge of ART (benefits, s l o r t n o C s e s a C a i r e t i r C s r a e y 8 1 = s r a e y 8 1 = e g A Duration on ART More than 3 months* More than 3 months Clinic attendance record Attended same clinic in the last 6 months# Attended same clinic in the last 6 months Level of ART adherence (Time schedule and dose) Less than 95% in all more than 95% in all y r o t a l u b m A y r o t a l u b m A s u t a t s l a n o i t c n u f t n e i t a P Mental state Competent and respond to questions Competent and respond toquestions 123 adherence, eligibility, names of drugs) and basic prevention methods (condom use, abstinence, avoid multiple sexualpartners, avoid needle sharing). Stigma was assessed in twothemes: negative self perception and discrimination experiencesat home and in their community. Statistical Analysis Data were entered using Microsoft Office Access 2007, cleanedand transferred to Stata version 10 for analysis. Patient matchedcase-control pairs were created using Microsoft Office Excel2007. Depression was scored as follows: 0 points rarely or noneof the time (< 1 day); 1 point some or a little of the time (1-2days); 2 points occasionally or a moderate amount of the time(3-4 days); and 3 points most or all of the time (5-7 days). A caseor control was categorized to have full support if responded tohave support in three or four of the themes, partial support wasone to two, and no support if responded to have no one to provideany of the four support themes. Knowledge was classified asgood if the respondents answered all the questions correctly.Distance was defined as the estimated distance of the patientresidency from the study clinic measured in kilometres. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non adherence.The criteria for selection of variables possible for inclusion inmultivariable analysis were based on p value of less than 5%.The strength of association was measured using matched OddsRatios (mOR). Ethical clearance The study received scientific and ethical approval from theMuhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences ResearchEthics Review Board (Ref.No.MU/RP/AEC/Vol.XII/58).Permission was granted by Region, District and hospitalauthorities. Verbal informed consent for participation wasobtained from patients using local Kiswahili language.124 Results Demographic characteristics Three hundred and sixteen patients receiving ART participatedin the study (79 cases and 237 matched controls). The mean(SD) age was 37.2 (8.5) years. About (64.2%) of the participantswere females, (65.8%) were married or cohabiting and (71.8%)were Muslims. Majority of the patients completed primaryeducation (73.4%), unemployed (74.1%) and (59.2%) reportedan average monthly income of less than US$50 (Table 7 1).Individuals were more often living more than 5km away from theART clinic (46.5% d\"5km vs. 53.5% e\"5km).There was nosignificant difference cases and controls patients withrespect to socio-demographic characteristics. Univariate analysis In a univariate analysis none of the socio-demographicdeterminants was found to be associated with non adherence toART (Table 7 1). Persons with undisclosed HIV-positive statusand those used alcohol were more likely to be non adherence(Table 7 3). Failure to disclose ones sero status was significantlyassociated with non adherence to ART (mOR 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Similarly, individuals who disclosed not to their relativeswere more than three times (mOR 3.3, 95%CI (1.3-8.5) likely tobe non adherence to ART. The odds of patients who drink alcoholwas almost two times greater compared to that of non alcoholdrinkers (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). As shown in Table 7 3, takingcare of under-five children, having episodes of depression andlack of support were not significantly related to non adherence.The proportion of patients without support was very low in bothcases and controls (12.7% for cases and 11.4% for controls,respectively). The majority of cases and controls rarelyexperienced episodes of depression (65.8% in cases and 72.2%in controls).125 A high proportion of controls (73.0%) never missed clinic appointments in the past three months. While more than half ofcases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of fare orother reasons. Failure to adhere to clinic appointment due tolack of fare and other reasons was found to be associated withnon adherence to treatment (mOR 4.2, 95% CI 2.2-8.1 and mOR2.1(1.2-4.2), respectively. Majority of patients (73.3% cases and64.9% controls) used public minibuses to access ART services.A very small proportion of cases (8.9%) compared to controls(44.7%) reside within a walking distance to the ART clinic (Table7 4). The proportion of patients with good knowledge of HIV-prevention was high (68.3%) among controls compared to cases (50.6%).Patients with poor knowledge of basic HIV prevention were twotimes more likely to be non adherence compared to patientswith good knowledge of ART (mOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.3-3.6). A highproportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%, respectively)had good knowledge of ART benefits, ART adherence and ARTeligibility. Self perceived stigma was not associated with nonadherence to ART (mOR 0.9, 95%CI 0.6-1.6) in this studypopulation (Table 7 4). Only one variable on patient-provider interaction; satisfied with providers, was related to suboptimal adherence to ART. Patientswho reported not to be satisfied with health care providers weretwo times more likely to be poor adherence to ART (mOR 2.0,95%CI 1.2-3.8). Spending long time with providers and frequentmeetings with counsellors were not associated with adherenceto ART (Table 7 5). Multivariable analysis In the final multivariate conditional logistic regression (Table 7 6)the following were identified as risk factors for non adherence:Missed clinic attendance due to lack of fare (adjusted mOR 6.4,95%CI 2.6-15.9), missed clinic due to other reasons (adjusted126 mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.1-4.8), disclosure of HIV-positive status to other than relatives (adjusted mOR 5.2, 95%CI 1.4-19.5) andfailure to disclose (adjusted mOR 2.8, 95%CI 0.6-13.5). Otherfactors included poor knowledge of basic HIV prevention methods(adjusted mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.1-3.8), Alcohol intake (adjustedmOR 1.8, services provided(adjusted mOR 1.8, 95%CI 1.1-4.2). Discussion Previous studies on ART adherence in Tanzania have utilizedcross-sectional and qualitative designs which lack the temporalorder [26], [31], [32]. This case control study design is unique inthis setting where adherence is reported to be more than 95%[33], [32], making non adherence a rare event. Thus case controlstudy provides an effective approach to analyze the possibleassociations, and potentially determines more accurately whichpossible factors are directly related to non adherence, and whichare merely related by a common cause. In this study, we did not find an association between adherence to ART and socio-demographic characteristics. Consistent withprevious studies on adherence to ART by gender, age andeducation levels [34]. The possible explanation for this finding isbecause we studied a homogeneous population with little socio-demographic and economic variations. Social support may enhance adherence through encouragement, reassurance, reinforcement, systematic cues, bolstering ofcompetence, and motivation or by masking the effect of stress,anxiety and depression. Social support was not significantlyassociated with adherence to ART in this study. This is in contrastto other previous studies where lack of support was related tosub optimal adherence to ART [25], [35], [36]. However theproportion of cases and controls without social support in thisstudy population was very low which possibly overshadowed theeffect of lack of social support. Equally depression was not127 associated with poor adherence, again, because of low proportion of cases that experienced depressive symptoms occasionally(3-4 days) and in most days (5-7 days). In other settingsdepression has been an important predictor of poor adherence[29], [35], [36]. The low proportion of patients without socialsupport and those who experienced depression symptoms canbe explained by the common phenomenon and sometime is arequirement for ART patients in rural care and treatment clinicsto have treatment assistants. A treatment assistant reminds thepatient about drug intake times, collecting drugs at health facilityand reporting side effects to the clinicians [6]. Stigma and discrimination against HIV-infected people was limited to perceived stigma in both cases and controls. Stigmawas reported as self blame and fear to disclose one's HIV-positivestatus to other people which may result into gossips and lose offriends. Though we found no significant relationship betweensuch perceived stigma and their treatment adherence, suchstigma may lead to patients' unwillingness or fear to take medicinewhen other people were present. None of the study participantsreported to have experienced stigma and social exclusionbecause of HIV-positive status. Other studies has highlightedstigma to be a barrier to adherence [37], [38]. The high burdenof HIV-infection and more than two decades of AIDS relateddeaths in our study population have created awareness andperception evolution that reduced the magnitude of stigma whichwas experienced in first decade of HIV-epidemic. In this study,majority of patients disclosed their HIV-positive status to fewfamily members and close relatives. Disclosure was significantlyrelated to adherence, and this can explain the perceived stigmain this study population. Fear of disclosure has been documentedto be among the barriers to adherence in African settings [16]. Alcohol consumption is one of the known barriers to ART adherence in both rural and urban settings [39], [37]. In somecommunities alcohol use is believed to temporarily alleviate HIV128 related psychological problems [38]. Alcohol use can result into forgetfulness of the dose timing and dietary instructions thataccompany some antiretroviral medications. Excessive alcoholuse can cause liver damage and exacerbate antiretroviral drugside effects. In agreement with these studies alcohol use was asignificant predictor of non adherence to ART in the present study.Our assessment of alcohol intake was limited to self-report ofconsuming alcoholic beverages two or more times in a week,there were no more questions to quantify the amount consumed.This can limit the strength of association between alcohol intakeand adherence to ART. However these findings indicate theimportance of regular alcohol counselling and education relatedto ART adherence among HIV-patients on ART. World Health Organization included free access to ART at the point of service delivery as a component of its public healthapproach for reaching universal access in low income countries[3]. Although coverage rates continue to increase but most ruralresidents still have to travel long distances to access ARTservices. Transport costs can pose an important barrier to clinicattendances and ultimately poor adherence to ART [23], [22]. Inthis study, most of the patients needed some form of transportto reach ART clinic. Majority of cases and controls used publicminibuses and therefore had to pay for the transport. We foundthat lack of transport money coupled with other reasonssignificantly associated with non adherence. Adaptation of thetuberculosis Direct Observed Therapy as a strategy to improveadherence to ART in settings like this need to address transportcost challenges. Dispensing of ARVs in quarterly bases afterthe first three months of monitoring adherence and toxicity, canreduce the transport costs and encourage adherence success.Where feasible government subsidized transport can reducecosts to the patients substantially [22]. The ongoingdecentralization of ART services to rural health facilities129 subsequently will reduce the transport needs for majority of the patients in Tanzania. Knowledge of basic HIV-infection prevention measures was significantly associated with adherence to treatment. Butknowledge of ART benefits, adherence requirements andeligibility was not related to adherence to ART. This contrastingfinding is explained by the high level of HIV-infection preventionawareness in the communities, and acts as a motivation of ARTadherence. Majority of the patients responded to two questionsthat assessed knowledge of ART benefits that ARVs prolong lifeand protect against opportunistic infections, compared toquestions on eligibility, adherence schedules, doses and namesof drugs. To remember the complicated names of ARVs, a highlevel of education is required; no wonder in some settingseducation level is associated with adherence [16]. However, inpractice lack of information and communication about treatmentis the actual barrier to treatment [37]. Although delivery of ARTcounselling and education in our study population is done inlocal spoken language, but there is a need to explore the contentof Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materialsused and how local disease concepts are communicated.Understanding and incorporating local peoples' perception andfeelings towards HIV/AIDS in developing IEC materials is one ofthe ways to impact ART knowledge to PLHA and improvecommunication between patients and providers. Good patient-provider relationship and patients' satisfaction with health care services have shown positive correlation withadherence to ART in some settings [40], [41]. Regular contact with either counsellors or long time spend with providers werenot associated with adherence. But, patients who felt not satisfiedwith the time they spend with providers were non adherent totreatment. Such patients probably were unable to express theirconcerns about medications. In this setting continued patientscounselling tailored to individual needs would improve adherence.130 ART patients taking care of children below 5 years may forget to take medications due to being busy or stress of caring for thechild. The lack of statistical significant relationship between caringof under-five children and adherence to ART is because the studysample is not big enough to segregate this variable betweenmale and females. Traditionally, daily care of children is the dutyof the females. Interpretation of our study findings must be taken in the light of its limitations. The time set of three months adherence was tooshort to capture non-adherence risk factors dynamics. Temporarychanges of risk factors making cases or controls become controlsor cases might have affected the analysis but we had to set thetime limit considering the possibility of recall bias. Conclusions We found that patient-important barriers to good adherence arefear of disclosure one's HIV positive status, use of alcohol, lackof good knowledge of basic prevention methods, unsatisfied withproviders and transport costs to ART clinic. These findings explainthat adherence is a dynamic process that varies depending onregion or cohort specific adherence factors. Adherenceimprovement strategies need to take into consideration sitespecific adherence determinants, patient experiences andconcerns. Dispensing of ARVs in quarterly bases can reducethe transport costs and encourage adherence success forpatients residing far from ART clinics. But more research isneeded on ART adherence and virological suppression in patientsresiding far away from ART clinics who may require a threemonths ARVs supplies.

NACP and NGOs embarked on ART services scale-upprogram aimed at improved ART availability and accessibility.Through this program ART services were established at HealthCentres and selected dispensaries. However, no previousdocumented experiences existed at country level to guideprovision of services. Therefore, this study was designed togather experiences and share lessons learnt with other healthcare providers and program implementing partners. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involved patientsenrolled to ART services between May 2007 and April 2009.Data collection involved observation of health providers'performance and retrospective ART and Care patients' registersreview. Results During the study period, 611 care and 284 ART patients wereattended. Majority of patients 762/895 (85.1%) were adults aged25-45 years, while children were 27/611 (4.4%) pre ART and 16/284 (5.6%) ART. (61.5%) patients had CD4+Tlymphocytes d\"350/\u00b5l the cut-off point for initiating ART. Thefrequency of symptoms was noted to significantly decrease withincreasing CD4 counts (p<0.001). However, numbness, parotidenlargement and genital discharge were not related to patientlevel of the most diagnosed AIDS definingillnesses. Sixteen patients on care died and 30 were lost to followup. Overall the clinical management was poorly performed. Conclusions In conclusion ART services can successively be provided athealth centre level and encourages HIV-infected persons to seekcare. However, clinicians need regular clinical mentorship andsupportive supervision.150 Introduction Tanzania HIV/AIDS care and treatment services were initially focused at District and other high level health facilities (MOH2005). Health centres were left out due to several reasonsincluding lack of qualified clinical staff, lack of adequateinfrastructure and supply logistics problems (Wyss 2004), (Katabira & Oelrichs 2007), (Kober & Van Damme 2004).However, many patients from remote rural areas experienceddifficulties in accessing care and treatment in District hospitals.The majority of patients in rural areas travel long distances toreach District hospitals and endure long waiting times in queuesat the clinics (Hardon et al. 2007). As a result, patients fail tofollow routine appointments and failed to adhere to appointmentschedules for ART treatment. Tanzania National AIDS ControlProgram (NACP) challenged with the rapid increase of AIDSpatients in District and referral hospitals recognized the need toestablish ART services at Health Centres and other selectedlower health facilities aimed at improving access and adherenceto ART, reduction of loss to follow up and stigma (MOH 2005).Consequently, NACP and Non-Governmental Organizations(NGO) implemented a regionalization approach aimed atincreasing the speed of ART scaling-up process to cover theentire country. Each NGO was assigned specific regions toimplement ART services and related programs. A national ARTaccreditation protocol was developed and used to assess healthcare facility infrastructure capacity, available human resourcesand potential volume of HIV/AIDS patients. Through this processChalinze health centre was accredited to provide ART serviceswhich were commenced in May 2007. A typical Health Centre has 15 bed capacities and is managed by an Assistant Medical officer supported by medical assistantsand assistant nurses. Laboratory services at the health centreare limited to basic haemoglobin, sputum, urine and stool151 microscopic examinations. Usually a Health Centre serves as a third level of health services referral hierarchy, followed bydispensary and village health post. A Health Centre is expectedto cater for a population of 50,000 people which is approximatelythe population of one administrative division in Tanzania. However concerns have been raised about the quality of ART services delivered in Health centres due to inadequate humanresource capacity and lack of laboratory facilities for monitoringCD 4 + T-lymphocytes testing (Van Damme et al. 2006), (Kober & Van Damme 2004), ( Katabira & Oelrichs 2007). Furthermore,establishment of care and treatment clinics at lower levels ofhealth care facilities poses challenges on the health system abilityto pull enough resources (Morrison 2002) to cope with increasedlogistics demands, supply chain management and supportivesupervision. Such challenges can be addressed by health centrepatient treatment cohort analysis. Currently there is no publisheddata on health centre experiences of delivering ART services inTanzania. This study therefore, was designed to gatherexperiences and share lessons learnt with other health careproviders and program implementing partners. The major objectives of this study were: (1) to describe HIV and AIDS case management at a rural health centre level in Tanzania,(2) to assess short-term outcomes of patients attending careand treatment at a health centre, (3) to describe experiencesand lessons learned in the process of implementing ART in arural health centre in Tanzania. Methods2.1. Setting Chalinze Health Centre is the largest rural Health Centre inBagamoyo District in Pwani Region, Eastern Tanzania. The healthcentre is located at Chalinze town, 80 km and 70 km fromBagamoyo District and Tumbi Region Hospitals, respectively.152 The Health centre serves inhabitants of seven villages around Chalinze town with approximately population of 300,000 people.Most residents are farmers and small scale traders and rely onhealth services delivered by the Health centre. The HIV-1seroprevalence in 2007 was 15%. The health centre startedoffering ART services in May 2007 with financial support fromPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) andtechnical support from Columbia University Mailman School ofPublic Health (ICAP). ICAP provided clinical training andmentorship, renovation of the health centre building to createrooms for ART services, procuring equipment and supplies, andestablishing systems to support laboratory services and datacollection. The staffs at health centre involved with ART servicesdelivery were trained for two weeks using training modulesaccredited by Tanzania National AIDS Control program. ARTtreatment started under the supervision and mentorship ofexperienced Doctors and Nursing officers from Tumbi RegionalHospital in collaboration with ICAP staff. The ART start-up clinicalteam comprised of one clinical officer (with diploma in clinicalmedicine), two medical attendants (nurses), one pharmaceuticalassistant and a data cum registry clerk. By the end of April 2009,858 adults and children were enrolled for ART services. 2.2 Clinical services process ART services are provided daily Monday to Friday, two days in aweek are dedicated to newly enrolled patients to receivecounselling, clinical examination and laboratory evaluation.Laboratory services at the health centre are limited to basichaemoglobin, blood, urine, sputum and stool microscopicexaminations. sent to Tumbi regional hospital twotimes every week and results were obtained in the following week.Reasonable referral networks existed with dispensaries, villagehealth posts, Bagamoyo District and Tumbi Regional Hospital.153 Patients starting to use ARVs are given an appointment according to treatment guideline to be seen at the clinic after two weeks.From then on, provided there are no side effects, patients areseen and given ARVs at 4 weeks intervals. Clinical officers aremainly responsible for patients' clinical examination, treatmentinitiation, regimen changes and follow-up patient clinicalevaluation. Assistant nurses provide counselling according tostandardized protocols. Patients were eligible for ARVs if were symptomatic (WHO clinical stage III or IV), and have CD4+ T lymphocytes count of <200\u00b5l.Patients are required to meet a number of additional criteriaincluding: completing ART counselling sessions, nominating a'treatment assistant' to assist with adherence. The first-line ARTregimen Tanzania is a zidovudine (AZT) and efavirenz (EFV). ART isoffered free of charge in all public facilities in Tanzania, includingChalinze health centre.ART monitoring is done using standardized National monitoringtools which include care and ART registers. Patients are issuedidentification cards, upon registration, bearing demographiccharacteristics and dispensed ARVs regimen or Cotrimoxazoleand appointment date for the subsequent clinic visits.Standardized treatment outcomes are monitored every monthin the patient master cards and updated each month in the ARTregister; thereafter quarterly reports are sent to the Ministry ofHealth. 2.3. Data collection Two different methods of data collection were used; non-participant observations of health providers' performance andretrospective pre ART and ART registers reviews. Healthproviders' performance indicators are summarized in the following154 Table 8 1. The researcher took the role of non-participant observer in the consultation room. Verbal Informed Consent was obtainedfrom patients and the attending clinicians. Observation checklist was used to systematically document the clinician's actionsand approaches. The check list was developed based on theNational HIV and AIDS treatment guidelines (MOH 2005 ) and contained minimum set of actions which must be carried out forthe care given to be classified as adequate quality care. Table 8. 1: Clinical actions assessed by observations A sample of 40 patients categorized in two groups of newly enrolled (first clinic attendees) and continuing clients wereconveniently selected for this assessment. This is to allowcollection of comparable and triangulation of data. The concern, however, is that people who know that they are being observed may change their behaviour. This challenge wasaddressed by making observation to last long enough (2 months),thereby making clinicians to eventually revert to their normalbehaviour. It has been established that few people have thecapacity to keep up a \"perfect\" artificial behaviour for extendedperiods. Data collected from pre ART and ART registers reviews included demographic characteristics, signs and symptoms at firstenrolment to the clinic, laboratory results, treatment regimen startand stop dates and the reason for change, and reasons fortreatment termination.

Data analysis Data was entered into Microsoft \u00aeAccess, and analyzed usingStata Intercooled version 9. The observation scores werecompiled for each clinical process and the proportion of casesin which it was executed. A minimum set of actions were setaccording to the category of the patients (New or follow up case)all of which must be carried out for a case to have been handledwith adequate quality of care. The cumulative personal years offollow-up was calculated from the date of enrolment to cut-offpoint of follow-up or lost to follow-up or death of the pre ARTpatients. Lost to follow-up was defined as three or moreconsecutive months since last scheduled appointment. Patientstaking antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) were excluded from mortalityrate analysis because no death occurred and ARVs wouldconfound findings. Ethical clearance The study received scientific and ethical approval from theMuhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences ResearchEthics Review Board (Ref.No.MU/RP/AEC/Vol.XII/58) Permissionwas granted by Region, District and health centre authorities.Informed consent for participation was obtained from patientsusing Kiswahili language. Results Over a period of about 25 months, a total of 895 pre ART andART patients were attended at Chalinze health centre. Of theART patients 284 were still active during the study period andprovided complete data for analysis. Thirty (4.9%) patients oncare and 55 (19.4%) on ART were lost to follow-up. The quarterlycumulative numbers of patients enrolled and retained into careand ART are displayed in details in Figure 8 1.156 Patients' characteristics are detailed in Table 8 2. Majority of patients were adults' aged between 25 to 45 years. Only 27/611(4.4%) pre ART and 16/284 (5.6%) ART children were enrolledduring the study period. Majority of the patients were females622/895 (69.5%), males had higher mean weight compared tofemales (mean 53.3 and 46.3 respectively).Most patientsreported to be working 605/895(67.6%) and 281/895(31.4%)were ambulatory. At presentation to the clinic, majority of patients550/895 (61.5%) had CD4+T-lymphocytesd\"350 and 531/895(59.3%) in WHO clinical stages III/IV. Sixteen patients oncare died at different times during the study period, contributingto mortality rate of 2.13(95%CI 1.31 to 3.48) per 100 patient-years, and 23/284 (8.1%) ART patients died, resulting ontomortality rate of 0.042(95%CI 0.01-1.01). More than half (152/238(63.9%)) of patients on ART had CD4+T cells<200/\u00b5l. A wide range of signs and symptoms occurred and were recorded at enrolment. Patients whose CD4+T-lymphocytes counts werelow had more symptoms and signs than those with relativelyhigher counts. The frequency of symptoms was noted tosignificantly decrease with increasing CD4 counts. However,numbness, parotid enlargement and genital discharge were notrelated to patient level of CD4+T-lymphocytes counts. Manypatients reported weight loss, skin itching or rashes which wasfollowed by fever, body weakness and productive cough. Chronicdiarrhoea was found in only 47/895(5.2%) patients wassignificantly related to CD4+T-lymphocytes counts levels(p=0.02). (Table 8 3). Majority of patients enrolled for care received HIV test from Voluntary Counselling and testing centres (VCT) (39.4%),followed by outpatient (24.2%) and MCH/PMTCT (12.6%) (Figure8 2). Patients at the outpatient, inpatient and Tuberculosis unitswere tested through provider initiated testing and counsellingprogram. Surprising no patients were HIV-tested at sexually157 transmitted infection clinic (STI clinic) despite of training all clinical staff at the centre in provision HIV testing. Overall 282 cases of AIDS defining illnesses (ADIs) were diagnosed and treated during the study period. The most frequentADIs cases PneumocystisPneumonia 3/282(1.1%) (Figure 8 4). Clinicians were trained to use three methods to evaluate patients' eligibility to start ART: WHO clinical staging, CD4+T-cells countor combination of these two. About 45.7% of patients wereevaluated using CD4+T-cells counts while WHO clinical stagingonly was used in 39.1% of patients, and both methods wereapplied in 15.2% of patients (Figure 8 3). The average consultation time was 4 minutes. Seventy-five percents of the consultations lasted less than 5 minutes andnone more than 10 minutes. All consultations were characterizedby inadequate history taking and lacked explanations of thedisease, prescription and or the ordered laboratory investigations.Physical examination in terms of inspection and palpation headto toe was performed in 39% of the patients in a sitting positionand 6% were asked to lie on examination bed. Unless the patientvolunteered to show a lesion on the body, most often cliniciansnever solicited for abnormalities. Most prescriptions wererepetitions of the previous medications and not the diagnosis ofthe day. Occasionally patients would remind the clinician toprescribe additional medicines for the new complaint. Discussion Our study presents quantitative and qualitative findings; thequalitative findings were enlisted through observation of health158 care providers but did not collect data on patients' perceptions of the services provided. We found that clinical managementwas poorly performed, marked with inadequate physicalexamination, inaccurate history taking and short consultationtimes. Despite expectations that clinical practice could beimproved after ART training, we did not find any evidence tosupport such hypothesis. This study is not the first article toreport on poor technical quality of care: similar practices havebeen reported by studies conducted in primary health carefacilities in Tanzania in relation to malaria case management(Gilson et al, 1993) (Nsimba et al. 2002). Clinical mentorshipand regular supportive supervision programs need to bestrengthened in order to shape the clinical practice in peripheralhealth care facilities. At Chalinze health centre we found an excellent referral system networks used to access ART services by patients from nearbydispensaries and the transportation of samples to Tumbi hospitallaboratory. Similar referral mechanisms can be established inany sites linking HIV-infected patients with care and treatmentcentres. The large number of patients enrolled for HIV/AIDS care and treatment at Chalinze health centre within the short period of 25months is alarming. However, it may be the result of increasedawareness of ART health benefits, decreased HIV stigma dueto ART availability close to patients' homes and the big burdenof AIDS in rural population (Posse et al. 2008). HIV/AIDSassociated mortality rates in rural areas of Tanzania is known tobe more than 15 times compared to HIV-negative deaths rates(M. Urassa et al. 2001). ART services availability within shortdistances encourages patients who were to travel for longdistances or even days to seek ART care and treatment. Theproximity to services motivates entry to care and encouragesretention in care.159 Our findings point to already established facts that, it is possible to provide ART services in rural resource limited settings usingexisting health care workers after up-grading their skills (Wyss2004). Despite of the weakness and short comings documentedby this study, clinic attendance was growing steadily, an indicationof high demand for services and some degree of patients'satisfaction was noted with the services rendered. Patientsstudied experienced numerous signs and symptoms whereby;cough, fever and non-specific skin rashes were the mostfrequently reported. It is important to note that persistent coughis becoming a major sign of AIDS overtaking weight loss andchronic diarrhoea. Profound weight loss, chronic diarrhoea andprolonged fevers were noted to mark major signs and symptomsof AIDS in the pre-ARVs era (WHO 1987, (Piot et al. 1984). Inaddition, pain in terms of headache, abdominal pain and burningor burning/tingling sensations, when both symptoms areconsidered across the pain trajectory becomes one of the mostfrequently reported symptoms. Pain has been reported in othersettings as one of the most frequent symptoms (Bhengu et al.2009), (Sukati et al. 2005). This finding suggests that painmanagement must be prioritized by clinicians caring for HIV/AIDS patients. The number of children enrolled was rather lower than the 12% program set target. However, diagnosis and provision of ART inHIV-infected children is more complex than in adults. Diagnosisof exposed infants up to 18 months of age requires HIV-p24,RNA or DNA polymerase chain reaction tests (Lyamuya et al.1996). And also CD4+T cell percentage is required instead ofabsolute CD4+T cell count for older children which were notavailable during the study period. Therefore enrolment of childrenwas only based on clinical manifestation and HIV antibodypositive tests. This way many HIV-infected children might havebeen missed. The ongoing implementation of early infantdiagnosis using DNA polymerase chain reaction and the family160 cantered program are expected to increase enrolment of children into ART. A great achievement was observed through the relatively high percentages of patients received HIV-test at Outpatient unit,Tuberculosis unit and some from the inpatient unit of the healthcentre. These findings signify the implementation of provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) a complement to VCT.PITC was initiated with the aim of increasing uptake of HIVtesting, improve access to health services for people living withHIV, and create new opportunities for HIV prevention at the timewhen Chalinze town had only one stand alone VCT centre. PITCis implemented using the Opt-out approach (WHO 2007)involving the health care provider specifically recommending anHIV-test to patients attended at any of the health centres' units.Then pre-test information is provided, followed by HIV testperformed in the usual way unless the patient declines to betested. Many studies have recorded high mortality rates in the first three months in patients who were initiated on ART with CD4<200/\u00b5l(Jerene et al. 2006). In contrast none of the patients on ARTdied during the study period, despite of the majority started ARTwith CD4<200/\u00b5l. The possible explanation on the lack of earlymortality can be due to the lower prevalence of severe anaemiain this population (mean haemoglobin 10.9 in ART patients).Severe anaemia (Haemoglobin <8g/dl) is known to be correlatedwith high mortality rates in AIDS patients (Langford et al. 2007). In this study setting WHO clinical staging was expected to be used more frequently than CD4+T cell count in deciding ARTinitiation. However, due to unsatisfactory history taking andphysical examination practices, clinicians had to wait for CD4+Tcell counts results and delayed to initiate patients on ART. Suchdelays might have contributed to the deaths of patients on care.161 Papular Pruritic eruptions (PPE) were the most frequently diagnosed AIDS defining illness in this population. Dermatologicalmanifestations remain a major issue for those living with HIVdisease because skin manifestations are often disfiguring andstigmatizing. The characteristic of skin problems in HIV-infectedindividuals clearly indicates immunosuppression and haveaccompanied AIDS from early days of the epidemic (Piot et al.1984), (WHO 1987). PPE is a cutaneous marker of advancedHIV-infection and is known to be uncommon in immune-competent persons (Resneck Jr et al. 2004), (Eisman 2006).Kaposi's sarcoma and Herpes zoster are companions of skinproblems in AIDS patients. Although, these disease conditionsoccur in low frequencies but are always present in HIV-patientcohorts and are associated with severe immunodeficiency(Goedert et al. 1998). Early detection and treatment have beenassociated with long term survival of patients (Eisman 2006).Thus strategies aimed at active case finding of Kaposi's sarcomaand PPE need to be developed and clinicians should be alert inassessment and initiation of interventions for these problems. Tuberculosis remains common ADIs in HIV and AIDS patients, and is an early Opportunistic disease in the course of HIV-infection which carries the highest case fatality rate (Dye et al.1999) (Corbett et al. 2003). At Chalinze health centreTuberculosis diagnosis rely entirely on clinical suspicion andsputum examination, but still more than 30% of ADIs cases weredue to Tuberculosis. This finding indicates that more tuberculosiscases can be diagnosed in this population if standardizedTuberculosis screening tools and chest x-ray examination areadded to the sputum microscopy examination. Intensified casedetection and contact tracing need to be instituted in tandemwith community based prevention measures. The potential limitations of this study include the fact that patients were not interviewed to solicit their views on the quality of careprovided.162 Despite of the aforementioned limitation, we have highlighted important findings which provide confidence to programmanagers and clinicians that health centres can provide ARTservices. In addition Health centre based ART services improvesaccess to many HIV/AIDS patients in rural areas. In conclusion, the successes and the weaknesses indicated by this study are the lessons learned and are essential referencesin the course of HIV/AIDS scaling-up process in rural Healthcentres. Proper linkage and referral network of health centreART clinics with nearby diagnostic facilities is essential to ensurequality health care in rural settings. Supportive supervision andclinical mentorship could be established simultaneously with theinitiation of ART services in health centres. Competing interest No competing interests expressed by authors.

Over the pastdecades, management of HIV and AIDS has advanced in variousfields ranging from development and testing of pre-ARVsresistance markers in HIV-drug na\u00efve patients, CD4+ Tlymphocytes monitoring to the use of fixed dose ARVscombination therapy. Nevertheless, HIV and AIDS continue tobe one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in SSA(1). Finding effective HIV cure remains the greatest hope forPLHA. Under the current circumstances and on the absence of an effective cure provision of optimum HIV care and treatment isthe only option to prolong lives of PLHA and prevent further HIVinfection. More important ART is becoming available in theperipheral (rural) settings where access to heal th services andproper medication is limited. In these settings, until recently HIVrelated deaths were common due to poor access to ART (2).Gradually, rural residents have started to experience benefits ofART after the establishment of care and treatment services atsome health centres. In poor resourced countries the public health sector have recorded remarkable benefits in patients' survival outcomes dueto availability of free ART compared to the period without ART(3). Despite of these achievements higher mortality rates in thefirst 6 months of ART compared to developed countries has raisedconcerns. It is possible that early higher mortality is caused byco-infections that lead to continuous co-morbidity coupled withlate presentation to care and treatment. The high burden ofOpportunistic infections and polyparasitism in poor tropicalpopulations profoundly affects the outcome of HIV/AIDS (4). Co-174 infections with unrelated parasites increase the parasites overall virulence and adversely affects the natural history andprogression of HIV/AIDS. It has become increasingly clear thatHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria occur predominantly inpopulations who are poly-parasitized. Helminths are the mostcommon parasites found in HIV-1, tuberculosis, and malariainfected populations. Almost all of the major tropical diseaseshave been linked with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.Several studies point to the increasing risk and severity of clinicalmalaria that result from helminths co-infection and orSchistosome infections in HIV-1. In Malawi, a study showed thatwomen infected with hookworms were at 1.8 more times higherrisk of having malaria than uninfected women (5). Gallagher etal. 2004 observed increased risk of mother-to-child HIVtransmission in pregnant women with helminths co-infection (6).In addition, there is some evidence that helminths infectionsadversely affect the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis or theprogression to active tuberculosis in HIV-1 infected persons.Taken together, this evidence indicates that co-infection with oneor more parasites or Opportunistic infections may profoundlyaffect the outcome of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. We are still in the early stages of appreciating the full extent of the co-morbidity that occurs when helminths are superimposedon HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Anaemia has beenrevealed as perhaps the most important of the leading co-morbidity conditions. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, helminths andmalaria infections results in Anaemia, with malaria responsiblefor the greatest burden. Severe Anaemia resulting from helminthspoly-parasitism and malaria produces several adverse healthconsequences among the three particularly important Africansubpopulations: pregnant women, children, and individuals withHIV-1 infection. Among individuals with HIV-1 infection, Anaemiahas been shown to be an independent risk factor for early death;correction of Anaemia results on decreased risk.175 Evidence of the extensive geographic overlap between HIV-1 infection and tropical diseases, together with the deleteriousinteractions between both groups of infections, suggestssignificant, new opportunities to reduce the burden of disease insub-Saharan Africa. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malariaprograms should therefore expand their portfolios to integratehelminths and other neglected tropical disease control to reducemorbidity and mortality in vulnerable populations. Our study identified about 30% of HIV-infected patients who could not be clinically staged appropriate according to WHO clinicalstages, because they lacked the required signs and symptomsrequired in the guidelines. Some of these patients were found tohave CD4+Tcells<200/\u00b5l the critical cutoff point below whichserious Opportunistic infections occurs. Despite the recentchange in criteria for ART initiation in resource limited settingsfrom the previous CD4+Tcells<200/\u00b5l to CD4+Tcellsd\" 350/\u00b5l (7),the challenge of access to CD4 count remains unresolved inperipheral (rural) HIV/AIDS clinics. Clinicians caring for HIV andAIDS patients in the peripheral (rural) are not able to decide onthe appropriate management for some patients. Although theWHO clinical criteria continues to be emphasized as the basisfor deciding initiation of ART, patients presenting with clinicalstages 1 and 2 can easily be regarded as early presenters dueto increased awareness of ART benefits and availability ratherthan an outcome of a changed manifestation of a severe diseasewhich requires further laboratory investigations, which remainsun accessible. Patients with Herpes zoster and Papular Pruriticeruptions which are clinical stage 2 conditions were found tohave CD4+Tcells<200/\u00b5l. Again, promotion of CD4 testing to allpatients is a practical approach which is not absolutely feasiblein peripheral (rural) settings where blood samples need to betransported for CD4 testing. However, cohort specific clinicalmanifestation profiles linked to CD4 count levels can complement176 decision on when to start ART in patients with symptoms not in fitting with WHO clinical staging listed conditions. Clinical staging is intended to guide decisions on when to start ART and when to start cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. HIV/AIDStreatment guidelines provide details of specific staging conditionsand criteria for recognizing them. Clinicians need to understandand know how to apply these criteria to individual patients.However, our findings at Chalinze health centre cast doubt onthe ability of some clinicians to appropriately clinically stagepatients. The brief clinical consultations which were not longenough to register complete history and clinical examinationraises questions on quality of case management in similarsettings. Thus CD4+Tcells count results become an importantfactor to appropriately manage the patient and avoid delayingART to patients in need. Introduction of job aids and simplifiedprotocols based on local experiences can improve the overallperformance of clinicians and better care of HIV/AIDS patients.Most patients who reported at the clinics during the study period(April 2008 to March 2009) had severe immunosuppression thisis indicated by their low median CD4 cell count at presentation(84 cells/\u00b5l (IQR 29-127)). This can be explained by latepresentation at the beginning of the program a characteristic ofmost HIV/AIDS programs in SSA. It is expected that as ARTservices continue to be widely accessible, patients will start topresent early to HIV-clinics and reduce losses to follow-up.Several other reasons explain why patients are lost to follow upand present late to clinics. Availability of alternative care providedby local traditional healers partly contribute to treatment delayingpatients to seek modern health care, no-adherent and dropoutof patients from care (8). It is a common experience in resourcepoor settings of Africa for HIV-patients to consult traditionalhealers for psychosocial and health care first before moving tohospital and or other patients move away from hospitals totradition healers. Collaboration and integration of traditional177 healers in HIV and AIDS care programs have benefited patients and the program in some settings of East Africa (9). Werecommend establishment of collaboration between traditionalhealers and HIV program in areas where the two services exist.Traditional healers need training to understand basic HIV/AIDSinformation including availability and benefits ART. They shouldbe encouraged to refer patients to hospitals and avoidconcomitant administration of herbal medicines and ART. Main findings and their implications for future research and interventionsThis study covered four important issues as outlined in the goaland objectives. These findings provide useful considerations inthe process of scaling-up and provision of ART in peripheral (rural)or semi-urban settings with limited resources. With respect to the first objective, the study documented and analyzed HIV and AIDS clinical manifestations and CD4+Tlymphocytes count, examined the sensitivity of each symptomor sign to predict CD4+T lymphocytes count d\"350 /\u00b5l. One keyfinding is that by combining three symptoms including diarrhoeawhich persisted for more than two weeks in a HIV-positiveindividual is a good predictor of CD4+T lymphocytes count d\"350/\u00b5l. Considering this finding and the fact that more than 50% ofthe patients present to HIV and AIDS clinics with CD4+Tlymphocytes count d\"200/\u00b5l, this has significant consequencesnot only on mortality as described in other studies, but also inthe approach to case management. In settings where CD4+Tlymphocytes counts are not readily available, local experiencesof prevalence and types of symptoms presented by those livingwith HIV/AIDS should be used to initiate ART. Operation researchto document cohort specific HIV clinical presentation correlatedto CD4 count levels should be undertaken in all clinics with largenumbers of patients.178 Some signs and symptoms experienced by HIV and AIDS patients occur across the trajectory of HIV-disease did notefficiently predict CD4+T headache, abdominal pain andperipheral neuropathy. These symptoms were found relativelyweak in predicting severe immunosuppression. It is also importantto note however that such symptoms may occur secondary totraditional herbal medications taken by patients prior to enrolmentto HIV-clinic and can influence the relationship betweensymptoms presented and CD4+T lymphocytes changes (10).Each symptom experienced by HIV and AIDS patients influenceson the patient's quality of life. Persistent headache is bothersomeand may signify an underlying serious systemic condition or co-medications. Skin lesions cause disfiguring and at times seriousdiscomfort due to itching, as a result self stigma, isolation anddepression. However, most of these symptoms can be controlledby using ART if initiated during the early stages of AIDS. HIV clinical manifestations most often mimic clinical symptoms and signs of endemic diseases common in a particular region(11). Bacterial infections including tuberculosis in HIV-infectedindividuals have been well studied because of their public healthimportance in most regions of the world (12). Parasites co-infection in HIV/AIDS on the other hand, have currently beengiven due attention, especially intestinal helminths which presentwithout specific signs and symptoms. However, further researchon the role of helminths and other endemic parasites comorbidityin addition to HIV disease and the impact of comorbidity on overallHIV and AIDS case management should also be explored. With regard to the second part of the first objective, the study investigated the interaction between parasites and HIV in termsof effects on CD4+T lymphocytes and clinical monitoring of HIV/AIDS patients. Current clinical practice in HIV/AIDS clinics donot routinely screen for parasites co-infection in HIV-patients.179 Such practices allow underlying morbidity caused by parasites to advance and complicate clinical outcome. Findings of this study suggest that there is a high prevalence rate of malaria and intestinal worms in HIV/AIDS patients. Thisshould form the bases for cohort specific studies to determinethe burden of parasites co-infection in HIV/AIDS patients andchoose the appropriate modality of care. Similarly, HIV/AIDSclinics should be seen as opportunity for implementingintervention studies to address the problem of co-infection andco-morbidity. Study results show the benefits of treating parasitesat the time of initiating ART through improved CD4+Tlymphocytes counts recovery equivalent to that of patients withoutparasites co-infection. It can be argued that if HIV/AIDS programscan implement mass treatment for endemic parasites at careand treatment clinics, recurrent morbidity and probably mortalitycan be further reduced. It is important, therefore, to conductresearch to establish local burden of parasites in HIV-infectedpatients' cohorts in order to guide interventions. The second objective of this study examined factors related of non-adherence to combination ART. Optimal ART adherence isessential for maximal suppression of viral replication and longterm survival of patients. Different settings have specific barriersthat influence adherence to ART; such barriers are not necessarilyshared by populations in other settings. This study identified twobehavioural factors: disclosure status and alcohol drinking asstrong predictors of non adherence to ART. Other non-behavioural factors were inadequate knowledge of basicprevention methods; poor adherence to clinic appointments(because of lack of money for transport) and unsatisfactory withproviders. Study findings clarify the dynamic nature of adherenceto ART and its dependence on setting-specific influencing factors.Adherence improvement strategies need to take intoconsideration site specific determinants, patient experiences andconcerns. It is even more complex to maintain adequate180 adherence in rural areas due to seasonality of economic activities and consequential seasonal household mobility especially insettings where farms are located far away from homes and intranshumance nomadic populations (13). There are several strategic options for Tanzania National AIDS Control Program to consider implementing or adopting forperipheral (rural) population. In the case of seasonal ortranshumance population migrants to farm lands quarterly mobileART clinics to selected farm sites could provide an opportunityto maintain adherence to ART. For non mobile population,patients residing far from the HIV/AIDS clinic quarterly ARVsprescriptions and or drug refills collected by a treatment assistantcan reduce transport costs and encourage adherence success.Nevertheless, research is needed on ART adherence andvirological suppression in patients receiving three monthly ARVssupplies. The Tanzania National AIDS Control Program incollaboration with district ART teams need to identify mobilepopulations and establish community-directed outreach ARTclinical teams. Such teams can be deployed in a regular basis tosites far from ART clinics. This strategy will ensure continuedaccess to ART and improve adherence for patients in mobilepopulation. For peripheral (rural) hard to reach populationestablishing ART refill stations within the community could beconsidered and will benefit inhabitants of these areas. HIV/AIDS care and treatment clinic provides an opportunity to deliver prevention messages and interventions to patients.Usually patients establish trusted relationship with health careproviders and hence are more likely to listen, accept and practiceprevention methods provided by health care workers. The studyfinding show that patient with inadequate knowledge of basicprevention methods were more likely to be non-adherent to ART.This finding is striking and can be extrapolated to the deficiencyin contents of health talks. Health talks are useful in terms ofHIV-infection control if delivered properly and contain relevant181 information. AIDS prevention messages constitute part of post HIV-test counselling and continuous health education deliveredto patients during routine consultations. It was therefore expectedthat patients would be knowledgeable of prevention messagesbut there was no compelling evidence found. The quality of provider-patient interaction is an important factor in determining patient satisfaction with the services provided,and responsible for poor access to services. Stress of the workenvironment creates a negative impact on the provider behaviour.Sometimes health providers become irritable and handle patientsin the wrong way because of infrastructure problems (patientovercrowding, lack of electricity and inadequate water supply).Overwork due to staff shortages which lead to performing ofmultiple tasks; and shortages of drugs and supplies (14)negatively impact on provider-patient relationship. The use ofnon-professional staff to perform some activities which do notrequire much of a medical knowledge (15), optimizes skills ofthe health worker to cope with growing patient loads. Regularsupportive supervision, opportunities for professional and careerdevelopment, and recognition of staff performance boost staffmorale, and job satisfaction (16). The third objective of this study focused on experiences and lessons learned in the process of providing ART in peripheral(rural) health centre. The process of scaling-up ART is seen asa comprehensive and equitable strategy to stem the burden ofHIV/AIDS in poor rural settings. However, the use of ART in poorsettings has been challenged mainly due to lack of adequateinfrastructure and the related medication costs (17). These issueshave been continuously addressed by the Internationalcommunity, but the widespread use of ART raises the issue oflack of experience and best model of care to be replicated insimilar settings.182 The following lessons derived from managing HIV and AIDS at the Chalinze health centre ART services outcomes to date andthe possibility of replication of similar achievements to othersettings, the following aspects stand out: (1) ART services canbe provided effectively at a Health centre by less trained medicalstaff after a two weeks training course in HIV and AIDS care andtreatment. (2) Proximity of ART services encourages entry andretention in care for patients who initially could not afford regulartravelling to access care and treatment services. (3) ProvidingART services at Health centre strengthens the primary healthcare system and it also provides the opportunity to benefit noneHIV health care services in terms of infrastructure improvement,improved laboratory diagnostics and strengthened referralnetworks. The concept of integrated HIV/AIDS care and treatment as pioneered in Tanzania by the St.Francis Designated DistrictHospital chronic disease clinic (18) has benefits beyond improvinghealth care system. At Chalinze health centre, the integratednature of ART services gives an opportunity to patients to receiveall appropriate essential services in a coordinated way. Thedramatic physical wellbeing of AIDS patients who were at aterminal stage and reduction in morbidity as a result of ART intakeincreased confidence in clinical care. As result, the multi-purposestructure of health centres services creates an environment thatenables HIV/AIDS patients to be accepted by their communitieswhere they live. Under this clinical arrangement, the role of ARTin reducing stigma and discrimination for PLHA can be realized.Furthermore, HIV and AIDS require multi-drug therapy over anextended period of time so providing ART at health centres closeto majority of the poor patients promises good treatmentadherence and reduction of risk factors for development of drugresistance (19)]. Under these circumstances and the benefitsobserved, it is possible to provide ART safely and effectively in aresource poor setting.183 Recommendations The findings of this study provide useful recommendations forHIV/AIDS program, health system and the community. HIV/AIDS program level(i) Introduction of additional screening tools for pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma Pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma requires x-rays and skin biopsy for diagnosis confirmation, respectively. The lack ofthese diagnostic technologies in rural health facilities resultsin missed diagnosis and occasionally suspected cases ofthese conditions receives referral at patients' own transportcosts. Many patients in this study presented with chroniccough and fever, while the number of patients diagnosedwith pneumonia was too low compared to the number ofcough cases attended. Similarly Kaposi's sarcoma lesionscan be easily missed by clinicians during clinical examination,especially lesions in the mouth and other body cavities.Development of symptom and signs based screening toolssimilar to the one used for screening tuberculosis will increasecase detection and provision of appropriate management.Additionally, symptom and signs checklist tools if usedproperly are likely to improve the quality of HIV-casemanagement in peripheral (rural) health centres. (ii) Integrated supportive supervision The goal of supportive supervision is to promote effective, efficient and equitable health care. Providers in health centres require regular supervision from supervisors who can provide clear guidance and sufficientinformation aimed at improving patient management184 procedures, provider-patient interactions and overall management of primary health care facilities. HIV and AIDS programs need to develop an intervention package containing all components of ART services. Theintervention package will then be used by Regional healthmanagers during routine supervision. (iii) Clinical mentorship program Periodic mentorship program for clinical staff need to beinstituted to enhance the knowledge and clinical decisionmaking skills of clinicians providing care to HIV and AIDSpatients. A multi disciplinary team of trainers drawn from theregion health management team equipped with skills toprovide one-on-one and small group case based trainingneed to be established. Such an intervention will improvethe quality of HIV case management and clinical outcomes. Health care delivery system level (i) Task shifting Task shifting must be seen as part of an overall strategy that includes tangible measures to increase, retain and sustainexisting and new cadres of staff. Existing staff need to beflexible, motivated and support the delegation of some of theirduties in order to cope with the increasing burden of HIV/AIDS. Examples of tasks which can be lay-health care at ahealth centre level include: provision of basic HIV support,treatment adherence and psychosocial support; record clerksfilling in basic patient information and measuring body weight.185 (ii) Staff shortages Addressing staff shortages through expanded training opportunities and incentives to attract health care workers toremain and or accept to move and work in peripheral (rural)health centres is an important step towards ensuring qualityhealth services. The use of retired health care workers toprovide less demanding services like antenatal care andvaccination should be encouraged to alleviate work load toexisting staff. (iii) Laboratory diagnosis Strengthening laboratory infrastructure at health centres requires the provision of basic equipments and training oftechnicians to improve their knowledge and skills and providequality results. Basic laboratory tests that are essential forroutine care like stool examination for helminths, urine,sputum, haemoglobin and blood slides need to be improvedat the Regional hospital and health centres. This should becarried out in tandem with the establishment of qualityassurance systems and refresher training of laboratorytechnicians. Sample transportation from health centre toregional laboratories for CD4 cells count analysis, resultsturnaround time and reliability of the results needimprovement. Coordination and communication betweenlaboratories, clinic units and patients, equipmentmaintenance and referral processes should be established. (iv) Routine screening of helminths in stool and urine; and malaria parasites in blood. Patients registering for the first time atcare and treatment clinics should be screened for parasitesprevalent in the area. Tanzania National AIDS ControlProgram need to incorporate parasites screening andtreatment in the HIV/AIDS case management guidelines andtreatment packages.186 (v) Changing HIV/AIDS clinical presentation Tanzania National AIDS Control Program in collaboration with clinics managing large HIV/AIDS cohorts need toregularly review HIV/AIDS clinical presentation and their utilityin WHO clinical staging. This approach will assist cliniciansin peripheral (Rural) settings to improve patient managementand reduce possibility of inappropriate clinical staging. Inaddition data will readily available for revision of Nationaltreatment guidelines. (vi) Availability of simpler CD4+T lymphocytes counts Development of simpler CD4+T lymphocytes counts testingtools which uses solar power and requires no electricity andor refrigeration (cold chain). HIV/AIDS patients' management continues to be guided primarily by clinical staging owing to the insufficientavailability (or frequent breakdowns) of CD4 cells countmachines, shortage of qualified medical staff and lack oflaboratory reagents due to logistic issues. CD4+Tlymphocytes count machines currently in use are verycomplex and require highly qualified laboratory techniciansto operate. These equipments cannot be installed inperipheral (rural) health centre with simple infrastructure andunreliable electricity supply. Given all these technical and logistic issues, we propose the development of a simple and user friendly CD4+Tlymphocytes count instrument which can be used inperipheral (rural) health facilities. The instrument shouldmimic the pregnancy test or the HIV-antibody testinginstruments used in Voluntary Counselling and Testing. Atwo compartment instrument with different colour coding foreach compartment categorized by the amount of CD4+Tlymphocytes concentration (CD4d\" 350 cells/\u00b5l and187 CD4>350 cells/\u00b5l to provide useful information to guide HIV/ AIDS clinical care. (vii) Improved (IEC) information Although IEC materials are available in health facilities theneed to improve information contents of these materials tocover patients' needs and concerns is critical. Patients needto be educated on ART benefits, adherence requirementsand eligibility to ART. The amount of information should bereduced and simplified to enhance easy recall. (viii) Poor quality of services provided Quality of care is a concern in health care facilities (20)and both technical and perceived quality of care needs tobe addressed through improved appropriateness ofdiagnosis, prescribed treatment and interpersonal careincluding proper advice. Intervention to improve quality ofcare should consider addressing staff motivation,improved counselling and patients' follow-up. (ix) Sub-optimal adherence to ART in mobile population NACP and District HIV/AIDS programs collaboratively can develop and implement adherence strategies to addressadherence problems affecting patients residing in mobile ormigratory populations. Community level i) Advocacy Community based advocacy of the benefits of ART and early clinical consultation after a HIV-test positive result is requiredto reduce the number of late reporting and poor adherence to188 ART. In principle health intervention programs should incorporate ART information with emphasis to access, benefitsand adherence requirements. This strategy will enhance earlyand appropriate treatment seeking behaviour. ii) ART refill stations Geographic access to health facilities is relatively good inTanzania with approximately 75% of the population livingwithin 5 km of a health centre or dispensary (21). Since notall health centres have the capacity to provide full range ARTservices. However, they provide an important infrastructurewhich could be used to improve access to ART in peripheral(rural) areas by establishing ART refill stations. The dispensaryprovides good infrastructure for storage of drugs andmonitoring of adherence to ART. Since the dispensary is withinwalking distances for most of the people in peripheral (rural)settings transport costs and waiting times is reduced. Implications for future research 1. Case-control studies are needed in peripheral (rural) and urban settings to determine factors contributing to delayfor seeking ART care after testing HIV-positive. This studyindicated substantial delay in seeking care following a HIV-test positive result. The consequences of delayed initiationof care and treatment are determinants to patient survival,ART effectiveness and HIV-1 transmission. 2. Cohort studies are required to determine the levels of adherence to ART and virological suppression for patientsreceiving three months ART supplies. The comparisongroup may be patients receiving routine monthly ARTsupply.189 3. HIV/AIDS Cohort specific studies on the types and burden of parasites and other important co-infections will be used to guide development of site specific interventionstrategies and case management approaches. 4. Cross-sectional studies specific to a geographical area and HIV/AIDS cohort are need to establish HIV/AIDSpatients' cohort specific clinical manifestations. Thesestudies will provide evidence for continuous amendmentsof care and treatment guidelines. References 1. Brinkhof MWG, Boulle A, Weigel R, Messou E, Mathers C, Orrell C, et al.
