He was the author of The New York Times bestseller and National Book Award winning How We Die, and has also written for The New Yorker, The New York Times, The New Republic, Time, and the New York Review of Books. This collection of essays by one of my favorite authors is aptly titled: Thoughts on a Life in Medicine, and given the long and varied experiences Dr. Nuland has had, this book had to be added to my ever growing collection of his prolific writings. Most of the essays are reprints from his articles over the years 1998 through 2004 originally published in the American Scholar. Their subjects are varied and directed to many different audiences, from medical professional colleagues to world leaders, pushing them to look closely at their world of rapid scientific development and its many consequences that the world may not even yet realize no less understand. From his first hand investigation into the art of acupuncture and its use in place of traditional Western anesthesia in the operating theater to the subject of human cloning and DNA manipulation, the wide range of interests and deep understanding that is the hallmark of this author's books is carried forward in this collection again. But he doesn't limit his thoughtful reflections to just scientific matters as can be seen in thoughts on grief in a chapter on Islamic fundamentalism and again in the final chapter where he shares his own grieving heart over a patient friend who dies waiting for a heart transplant. Still in other chapters we read his thoughts on such topics as the placebo effect, a long history of grave robbing, weight training by the elderly, electroconvulsive therapy (of which he has extensive personal experience), several classic medical textbooks, two great paintings of surgical teaching by Thomas Eakins, writing, and even his own responding to a call for \"a doctor in the house.\" While this collection isn't as interesting as his award winning How We Die or the more recent Art of Aging (both of which I recommend highly), for Nuland fans such as myself, it was worth plowing through those topics of non-interest if for no other reason than to discover that final chapter (which, unlike the other articles, is first published here in this book) where he bares his heart in telling of his patient's failed wait for a heart transplant. Yes, our doctors are human and feel with their hearts, and I for one think that is a very good thing, i.e., \"my kind of doctor.\" Anyone who mentions the Flexner report without mentioning that it helped to close down pretty much every medical school for black or women doctors has a big heavy stupid white privilege knapsack shoved up his ass. Otherwise not such a bad dude, loved the end piece about his bromance with a heart transplant patient. Soooo dry.... I will die a death of boredom! I quit only a few chapters in. This book is way too detached. I do not want academic doctor thoughts. I want to get to know the doctor as a human, to know how they think. If that is the kind of book you are looking for, look somewhere else. Life is short, and Art long; the crisis fleeting; experience perilous, and decision difficult. - Hippocrates The Uncertain Art: Thoughts on a Life in Medicine is precisely what you'd expect from the subtitle - the musings of a physician after a lifetime's work in the field (Nuland, a surgeon and teacher at the Yale School of Medicine was 78 when the book was published). The book is really a collection of essays that cover such diverse topics as the aphorisms of Hippocrates (or, more accurately, the one quoted above), electro-shock therapy, exercise, organ transplants, the history and potential future of medicine, medical emergencies in public places, a pun-filled description of laxatives and colon health, 9/11, patient confidentiality and others. Nuland has a pleasant and engaging writing style and the essays are quite good, though are marred by one otherwise unfortunate blot relating to the form of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) known as acupuncture. Nuland writes, in what might rise to the level of medical malpractice, that acupuncture could be used in place of anesthetic for procedures such as open heart surgery. For those unfamiliar with the technique, a bit of background is required. In TCM it is believed that a person's life force (called 'chi') flows through pathways called 'meridians'. Illness occurs when this life force becomes blocked or imbalanced. Acupuncture involves the use of thin needles inserted into the skin at points which are said to coincide with locations where these meridians cross. The needles supposedly unblock the chi and return he patient to health. To put it bluntly, acupuncture is a pre-scientific superstitious belief. It lacks a plausible mechanism for effectiveness (there is no such thing as chi or meridians) and rigorous controlled clinical trials show that acupuncture doesn't work. It's sad and disappointing to see an otherwise strong adherent of scientific medicine put his powerful intellect to work rationalizing himself into acceptance of unmitigated nonsense. To put a positive spin on this otherwise unfortunate episode, perhaps it provides a cautionary tale for us all in our use of critical thinking skills to ward off magical thinking. If a man as intelligent as Nuland is subject to occasional lapses in judgement, surely we are all susceptible. There were many interesting insights into not only the life of a physician but the art of medicine and the care, body and soul, of the patient. It is written in self-contained, essay-like format, so you can pick and choose which parts you find most compelling or interesting. The section on acupuncture was especially interesting, as was the explanation for why we say \"God Bless You\" after someone sneezes. This is a series of essays by Dr. Nuland who wrote How We Die. The most interesting chapters are about acupuncture, grave robbing for bodies in the last century, cocaine as an anesthetic in the past, and his vision of medicine by the end of this century...WOW!. You won't believe the chapter on treating women in the 1800's for \"hysteria\" (sexual) and double wow. My favorite book of his is Lost in America, a memoir. A collection of essays -- I liked some a lot, others I didn't care for. Wish there was a more central theme and more about how to manage difficult decisions/emotions/etc (similar to the heart transplant patient story at the end) but overall an interesting read. "}
