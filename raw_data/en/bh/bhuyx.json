Two of the most come models of health and healing are Western Medicine and Eastern Medicine. These two approaches are vastly The three main components of emotion are the physiological changes, the subjective feelings, and the associated behavior. A perceived dangerous event or stimuli would result in a physiological response known as the 'fight or flight' response, which prepares the person to either confront the danger or avoid it whereas, the cognitive aspect of emotion would be interpreting the person's feelings and processing the proper response for it. Thus, a bidirectional relationship does exist between the cognitive and biological factors in This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. There are four major theories behind the theoretical framework within this module. Those four theories are Structural functionalism, Conflict theory, Social construction, and Symbolic interactionism. These four theories plays a crucial role in the medical system and are seen within Anne Fadiman's novel The Spirit Catches and You Fall Down. In the universe, good and evil intertwine to form the lives of people and the environment around them. Humans have, even from the beginning, thrived off systematic order of things, whether it be tribes coming together to survive the elements, or your new class schedule finally coming in the mail. One predominate thing we tend to prosper from is unified religion. One major religion, Taoism (all though more commonly known as Daoism), emphasizes a now universal theory of the Yin and Yang. This theory has established itself in all sorts of media, from books in the library to the songs heard on the radio. Arguably one of the most controversial books in American Literature, The Great Gatsby, has collections of characters that fall into the theorem Complementary therapies are treatments that make up a range of services provided by the NHS. Treatments that are available are acupuncture, aromatherapy, art therapy, chiropractic, herbal medicine and homeopathy. These treatments are offered to patients who may have cancer or other illnesses. These treatments are also used to help maintain one's health, improving the immune system, sleeping patterns, increasing energy levels and help to depose of toxins. Complementary therapies are not clinically tested but have been used for many years and also most therapists are self employed. Native American author, Mourning Dove, stated, \"What kept us going, was the knowledge that everything on earth has its purpose, every disease an herb to cure it, and every person a mission. That is the Indian theory of existence.\" (Mourning, 1990, p. 69) Histories that deal with health, illness, and medicine in America, often make passing mention of Native Americans as healers or sources of knowledge about medicine. Similarly, histories of Native-American cultures and early European contact pay attention only to health and healing with respect to these cross-cultural interactions. Many books and articles have been written on Native American medicine. However, there have been virtually no scientific studies done on tribal healing practices, undoubtedly due to the spiritual nature of the treatments. Some of these historical pieces of literature attempt to assess the impact of Native-American knowledge of New World herbs on the knowledge and practice of early-American elite physicians and botanists. Healing and medical practices of Native Americans has been obscured by time but there is anecdotal evidence available and competing perspectives about the true values of Native American healing practices Roth, Ronica. \"Partners of the Heart.\" neh.gov. Spark Media, Inc., 2016. Web. 10 Mar. 2016. Recently, due to an increasing trend in the use of natural products and services, Herbal Therapist demands have sky rocketed. Below are written the top 5 ways to become an herbal therapist. Through using the skeleton of a children's story, The Tao of Pooh is able to project philosophical ideologies in a coherent and unformidable way. The Tao of Pooh does so by symbolically relating its philosophical attitudes and practices of Taoism through the use of Winnie the Pooh characters and stories. While there is much to critique and comment on, the topic to which I believe warrants the most discussion, is that of the self. The entire context of The Tao of Pooh is revolved of around one person, or bear for that matter, and how his doing, or not doing, compares to the actions of the other characters. In the spirit of Taoism, I will try to keep this evaluation fairly simple. When we rely on our Inner Nature and practice self-reliance In ancient China religion was very important. The three-main types of religion were Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism. Taoism was founded during the Zhou dynasty. It was founded in the 6th century and was founded by Lao-Tzu. This religion believes that every living thing should have a force going through them. People who believe in the Taoism religion don't really believe in a bunch of rules. The Taoism religion came up with the idea of yin and yang. They believed everything in nature dealt with yin and yang. The forces of yin and yang could be thought of as good or bad. Taoism can teach others that they should live with their heart and The Chinese practice and exercise of Falun Gong has a short history. But it plays an important role in China for political reasons. The history of Falun Gong is only ten years old. But the ideas and practices is based on a tradition throughout the entire history of the Chinese civilization. The practice is a different form of qigong. The cultivation of qi or the energy that flows throughout the human body and the universe, has been a theory in many different practices of Chinese culture. Even the traditional Chinese medicine is partially based on the theory of qi. During the ten years history, Falun Gong has developed millions of participants and followers. It also got a lot of attention from many others including the Chinese government. However Chinese women suffer from the unfair notion for thousands of years. The basic requirements of being virtuous women are \"Three Obediences and Four Virtues ()\". The \"Three Obediences\" were \"obey your father before marriage (); obey your husband when married (); and obey your sons in widowhood ()\". And the \"Four Virtues\" were \"Female virtues ()\", \"Female words ()\", \"Female appearances ()\" and \"Female work ()\". (Sun, 2015). The three obediences and four virtues occurred in ancient China society. It is a set of basic moral principle for women in Confucian. These instructions first appeared in the \"Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial\" and in the \"Rites of Zhou.\" (Kelleher, 2005) to describe traditional ceremonial and behavior. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities. (16) Virginia Henderson defined nursing as: \"The unique function of the nurse is to assist the individual, sick or well, in the performance of those activities contributing to health or its recovery (or to peaceful death) that he would perform unaided if he had the necessary strength, will or knowledge.\" (Vera,2014) Henderson states that \"The nurse is the only twenty four hour worker. We are the only people that will say we stay with you. They are the people that will do for others what they will do for themselves. They have the strength, will, and knowledge. We are the patient's alter ego. We should try to get in their skin and find out what they need. If the nurse is the best prepared person to help the patient and there is no doctor available, nurses diagnose and treat "}
