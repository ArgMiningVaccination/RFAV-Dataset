Each of the selected APIs presented a particular challenge in terms of producing tablets with suitable hardness, weight, uniformity, content uniformity and/or reliable dissolution profiles. PROSOLV\u00ae EASYtab SP was shown to perform considerably better than the corresponding physical mixture of its components for all formulations tested.
