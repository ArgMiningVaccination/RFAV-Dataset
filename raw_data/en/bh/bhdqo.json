It's one of the oldest and most respected medicinal traditions in the world. Today, it's practiced widely, both in India where it originated and around the world. The [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ayurvedic-medicine-in-depth) Ayurveda focuses on preventing disease, so its approach to treating constipation encompasses a whole range of healthy choices, rather than focusing solely on laxatives and immediate relief. In addition to natural laxatives, an Ayurvedic diet, exercise, and massage are key elements of maintaining a healthy digestive system.

[Ayurveda](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198827/) [doshas](/nutrition/vata-dosha-pitta-dosha-kapha-dosha), which are forms of energy at work in the body. While every person has all three doshas, one is generally dominant. The dominant dosha is expressed in a person's body shape, characteristics, and health vulnerabilities. Here's a brief overview of the three doshas: - Vata: a type of energy associated with movement, space, and air - Pitta: a type of energy associated with metabolism, fire, and water - Kapha: a type of energy associated with body structure, earth, and water Together, these doshas regulate your body functions. An imbalance between them results in illness, poor functioning, or disease. Ayurvedic medicine explains constipation as an imbalance in the vata dosha, which centers in the [colon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7559905/) Some Ayurveda practitioners say constipation is related to an excess of cold and dry elements in the body \u2014 remedied by adding warmth, hydration, and oils. Some of the Ayurvedic laxatives described below can be made into warm, soothing teas or taken in tablet form with water. Some are available in liquid form, too. Triphala One of the best known Ayurvedic laxatives is [Triphala](/nutrition/triphala#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3), a medicinal blend of dried fruits from the plants Emblica officinalis (Amalaki or (Haritaki). A recent animal and human [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5567597/) [Research from 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33465446/) You can buy Triphala in a powdered form, which is useful if you want to brew an Ayurvedic herbal laxative tea. Some people find the taste of the laxative tea bitter. If you do, add a teaspoon of honey after your tea has steeped. Lemon isn't recommended. You can also buy Triphala in tablet or liquid extract forms if you prefer. Senna [Senna](/nutrition/senna-tea), an herb used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an over-the-counter laxative. Compounds in the herb (sennosides) stimulate the lining of the bowel, usually bringing constipation relief in 6 to 12 hours. Senna is considered to be safe for adults and children when taken at the right dose and for less than [1 week](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547922/) Some people may experience stomach cramps and diarrhea when taking senna. Children in diapers may develop blisters if their diapers aren't changed often when they're taking senna laxatives. Senna isn't recommended for children under 2 or people with these health conditions: - heart disease - electrolyte imbalance - dehydration - Crohn's disease - an intestinal blockage - ulcerative colitis - stomach inflammation - appendicitis - hemorrhoids - anal prolapse It's also important to know that taking senna in combination with other herbal laxatives such as horsetail, licorice, aloe, buckthorn, and others could cause a big drop in your potassium levels. When your body doesn't have enough potassium, you can experience a range of [symptoms](/nutrition/potassium-deficiency-symptoms), including fatigue, muscle cramps, and heart palpitations. Himalaya Herbolax This Ayurvedic constipation remedy contains haritaki (Chebulic myrobalan), one of the same herbs in Triphala. contains another Ayurvedic plant medicine: trivruth (Ipomoea turpethum/Operculina turpethum), which has [laxative](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28989252/) Although there are no studies on the effectiveness of the Himalaya Herbolax product itself, research does confirm that [haritaki](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665098/) [trivruth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28989252/) Caution: Don't give Himalaya Herbolax to children It's important to talk with a pediatrician before giving Himalaya Herbolax to a child. One of the ingredients in Himalaya Herbolax is Cassia occidentalis, an herb used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat constipation and other ailments. The seeds of the Cassia occidentalis plant are poisonous if consumed in high enough amounts. [Research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011371/) Ayurveda includes a health protocol known as [Panchakarma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/mid/NIHMS116241/) One of the treatments, Panchakarma basti, is cleansing the bowel through the use of medicated enemas (basti). Basti often contain herbal blends suspended in oil or ghee. The liquid preparation flows through a tube inserted into your rectum. After holding the fluid for a short period of time (usually minutes), you release the liquid into a toilet. Precautions when using enemas Although enemas can be used at home, Ayurvedic medicine practitioners usually recommend that Panchakarma basti be prepared and administered in a healthcare setting. A practitioner can help determine which herbs and oils to use according to your individual needs. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348737/) The [National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/concerned-about-constipation) In Ayurvedic medicine, Panchakarma basti is usually a seasonal or short-term treatment. In some cases, however, it's used over a longer period. For example, one [2018 case study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6033722/) Ayurveda includes therapeutic whole-body massage with medicated oils both as a regular health practice and as preparation for Panchakarma cleanses. Research shows that abdominal massage and deeper colon massage therapies can help relieve constipation effectively. A small [2016 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26825564/) recommend a few [yoga postures](/health/fitness-exercise/yoga-for-constipation) to help move the bowel and relieve constipation. The recommended poses include: - bhujanghasana (Cobra) - trikonasana (Triangle Stretch) - ardha matsyendrasana (Half Spine Twist) - supta vajrasana (Sleeping Pelvis) - vajrasana (Diamond) - dhanurasana (Bow) sarvangasana (Shoulder Stand) - mayurasana (Peacock) - pavan muktasana (Wind Release) - naukasana (Boat) - halasana (Plow) - shalabhasana (Locust) - mandukasana (Frog) - paschimottanasana (Head to Knee) - katichakrasana (Standing Spine Twist) Although more research needs to be done to understand how yoga may affect the digestive system, some evidence shows that yoga has helped people with [irritable bowel syndrome](/health/yoga-poses-for-ibs), a health condition that often causes both constipation and diarrhea. A [2014 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25025601/) [Researchers](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(16)30555-9/fulltext) noted that yoga also helps with the anxiety that sometimes goes along with having IBS. Ayurvedic medicine emphasizes the importance of a whole-body approach to health and wellness. Combining the following Ayurvedic lifestyle choices with the constipation relief methods described above can help you prevent constipation while achieving a healthier overall digestive system. Customize your diet to your constitution What, when, and even how you eat can affect your bowel movements and your overall health in many ways. From an Ayurvedic perspective, your diet will best promote your health when it's matched to your individual constitution. [Ayurnutrigenomics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624353/) Using both modern medical assessments and Ayurvedic principles, Ayurnutrigenomics prescribes certain foods, therapies, and eating schedules that proponents say will help you avoid health problems such as constipation. More research needs to be done to understand what benefits this dietary approach may have. Increase your consumption of fruits and vegetables The [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/constipation/eating-diet-nutrition) Eating lots of fiber-rich whole foods promotes good bathroom habits, while processed foods, meats, and fast foods are linked to constipation. Avoid dehydration Practitioners of Ayurvedic and allopathic (Western) medicine agree that dehydration causes constipation. Researchers have long known that even [mild dehydration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14681719/) Commit to regular physical exercise The holistic approach of Ayurveda includes regular physical exercise. Inactivity isn't considered healthy, as it leads to sluggish digestion and an accumulation of the elements of earth and water in the body. For that reason, treating constipation involves physical movement, often through yoga. One small [2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446167/) Similarly, a [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5734236/) Consider alternative medications that don't contribute to constipation Certain medications are known to cause constipation. These include: - opioids - antidepressants - antacids containing calcium or aluminum - iron supplements - diuretics and some other medications that treat high blood pressure - antihistamines If you're taking a medication that constipates you, it's a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider about alternatives that don't cause that side effect. Ayurveda is a medical philosophy that takes a holistic approach to treating health issues such as constipation. Short-term relief can be achieved using natural Ayurvedic laxatives such as Triphala, senna, and Himalaya Herbolax. These remedies are plant-based, generally safe, and effective. You may also want to try a medicated enema or a medicated oil massage. An Ayurvedic approach to good digestive health also involves drinking plenty of water, eating more fruits and vegetables, and getting more physical exercise, especially yoga. In addition to potentially relieving constipation, yoga can improve your sense "}
