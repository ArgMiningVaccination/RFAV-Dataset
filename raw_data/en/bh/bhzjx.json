Using pharmaceutical techniques combined with a spiritual approach, they formulated a truly innovative line of quality products based upon the study of relationships between the substances and processes of nature and the human being. By cuLivating plants using organic and biodynamic agricuLural methods, harvesting them at peak times, and processing them with the utmost care, WELEDA believes it is possible to retain a plant's inherent qualities and healing properties.
