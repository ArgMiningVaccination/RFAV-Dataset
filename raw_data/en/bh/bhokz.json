[www.ahna.org](http://www.ahna.org/) CCAP Course Details Length - In-Person or online The course comprises four modules, each one over two full-day classes. The modules are spread out over 9-12 months. The modules must be taken in consecutive order. Contact hours are awarded upon completion of each module. Homework There is homework in the form of 40 case studies (10 per module), one for each essential oil studied. These are to be completed between modules and presented in class. They give the student an ongoing practical experience of applying essential oils in a clinical setting. Project Each student completes a research project that results in a written paper. Exam The exam is in 2 parts - a written test and presentation of a small research project - both parts are externally assessed. Certification Certification as a Clinical Aromatherapy Certified Practitioner (CCAP) is awarded after the completion of 40 case studies, project presentation, and successful written examination.

Disclosures The instructors teaching Clinical Aromatherapy for Health Professionals have no conflict of interest relative to the content of this educational activity. One of the requirements of the CCAP course is to complete a small research project. Some students carry out ambitious hospital-based studies that require IRB (Internal Review Board) approval. Others complete more modest, but still interesting, studies on family and friends exploring the effects of clinical aromatherapy on insomnia, menopausal symptoms, gender preference, memory enhancement, nausea and so on. There is new research into the clinical use of essential oils emerging all the time and it would not be possible to list it all on this website. However, there are many on-line databases, such as PubMed and Medline that will enable you to search. It is best to use the botanical name of the plant rather than 'aromatherapy'. R.J. Buckle Associates reads and critiques every study. Typically more than 50% are suitable for publication. However, very few students actually follow this path! Getting published in a peer-reviewed journal is hard work. The best paper is not written, it is rewritten. But unless your work is out there for the world to read, what you have done will have minimal impact. Dr. Buckle was a reviewer for NIH and NHS and says that the best research in the world has often started in a very modest way. Go on and have a try! Sometimes, a meticulously observed and documented case-study will be accepted for publication. \u2014Dr Jane Buckle PhD, MA, RN, Cert Ed IN-PERSON Each Module is $375 for non-AHNA members and $350 for AHNA members.
