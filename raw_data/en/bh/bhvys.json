Learn more in the pages below about what you can do for yourself, your family and your community. Masks are still effective tools to reduce the risk of spreading or being exposed to COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses. Masks protect you and others by reducing the amount of droplets that enter the air when someone coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes. Our recommendations on when most people should wear a mask change based on the level of COVID-19 spreading in the community. Currently, we are at a low level of COVID-19 community transmission. To reduce your risk of getting COVID-19, consider still wearing a mask in crowded indoor public settings, such as on public transit, at large events, and when shopping in crowded stores. "}
