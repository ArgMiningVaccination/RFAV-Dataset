Clients and coaches will typically start by identifying the problem area(s) that the client hopes to address\u2014then, the coach will help the client brainstorm potential solutions and explore concrete techniques to help the client attain their goals. [Coaching](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/coaching)is typically short-term and focused on finding solutions in the here and now, rather than exploring a client's past. In addition to strategies aimed at the client's specific concerns, coaches may encourage general stress management techniques such as meditation. Can a life coach help treat anxiety? Because the majority of life coaches are not licensed clinicians, they are not qualified to diagnose or treat anxiety. Anyone struggling with anxiety or another mental health condition should seek help from a licensed mental health practitioner. However, some coaching clients who struggle with subclinical anxiety report that working with their coach on other problems\u2014such as career dissatisfaction or unhealthy habits\u2014has a positive effect on their anxiety. Can life coaching be done online? Yes. While life coaching often happens in person, many coaches conduct sessions over the phone or via online platforms such as Zoom or Skype. Because life coaches are not subject to local licensing regulations in the same way that therapists are, they are able to see clients who live in other locations. How long does life coaching last? Life coaching tends to be a shorter-term process than therapy, though it does not always unfold over a specific period of time and is instead based on the coach's or the client's preferences. Coaching often takes place over three to 12 months but may be shorter or longer if necessary. About Psychiatrists, meds and Psychiatric Nurses.
