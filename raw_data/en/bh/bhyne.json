The purpose of this study was to determine the potency and efficacy of inactivated-vaccine i n addition with adjuvant against KHV in koi fish. The viral propagation was done using a KF-1 cell lin e in 25 cm2 flask. The cultured virus was harvested on 12 days post inoculation, and then the harvested virus w as inactivated with 0.1% formalin as inactivated-vaccine. Three hundred of test fish (10.38 \u00b1 1.25 g) m aintained in 126 L of plastic containers with aeration, and fed with pellets twice a day. After 14 days of ada ptation, the fish were divided into five treatments (A= vaccine; B= vaccine + Complete Freund's Adjuvant ; C= vaccine + Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant ; K+= positive control, and K-= negative control) and each treatment has four replicates. Vaccine was given by injecting intramuscularly of 0.1 mL per fish. All fish were challen ged by injecting intramuscularly of 0.1 mL of KHV virus with concentration of 104.58 TCID50/mL after 21 days post vaccination. The results showed that the B treatment had higher (P<0.05) values of hematocrit level, lysozyme activity, and titer of antibody compared with positive control. In addition, the survival o f fish in B treatment also had the highest percentages and significantly different compared to other treatment s (P<0.05). The conclusion of this research was the application of inactivated KHV vaccine in 0.1% for malin with the addition of Complete Freund's Adjuvant through the injection dose 0.1 mL fish-1 in 104.58 TCID50/mL capable to enhance the immune responses and raised the optimal protection of KHV antibody in koi Koi Herpesvirus Disease (KHV/KHVD) is a virus that causes the contagious disease in koi and goldfish (Ilouze et al., 2006). KHVD was first reported in Israel and the United States in 1998. Furthermore, the disease spread to other countries such as Poland, UK, Germany, and the Netherlands (Antychowicz et al., 2005). In Asia, KHVD outbreak was first reported in Indonesia in April 2002 (Melba, 2004). Fish infected with KHV showed pale white and necrosis in the gill filaments. Other clinical symptoms may include abnormal eye, pale body surface, mucus production, and pale spots on the skin. KHV outbreaks in some cases showed no clinical symptoms (Lio-Po, 2011). This virus can infect goldfish when the watertemperature ranging from 17\u00b0C-27\u00b0C whereas high virulence occurs at a temperature of 22\u00b0C-24\u00b0C (Perelberg et al., 2003). Deaths caused by KHV may reach 80%-95% (Sunarto et al., 2005). Several kinds of vaccines used in fish farming, among others; whole-cell vaccines, vaccines from cell components, and DNA vaccines. The viral vaccine is an antigen preparation derived from attenuated or killed. Yasumoto et al. (2006) in Japan developed a formalin-inactivated vaccine KHV by utilizing lipo- somal membrane applied to the fish feed. Nakajima et al. (1999) using iridovirus vaccine from GF cell grunt which was formalin inactivated for 12 days at 4\u00b0C and obtain 72% of relative percent survival (RPS). The type of adjuvant used is Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA). According to Aucouturier et al. (2001), IFA is a water in oil (W/O) emulsion, which is able to improve and stabilize the42Potency and efficacy test of a vaccine in addition with adjuvant ..... (Lili Sholichah) antibody titer. The purpose of this study was to de- termine the potency and efficacy of inactivated vaccine against KHV combine with adjuvant which produced from KF-1 cell cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Procurement Fish and Virus Isolates Three hundred of koi fish ( Cyprinus carpio ) used in this study (average weight of 10.38 \u00b1 1.25 g) were obtained from a private farm in Sukabumi, West Java which provides the SPF (Specific Pathogen Free) KHV through previous PCR test. Virus strain was namely BJMN-2, which was a collection of Research Station for Fish Disease Control, Depok, Indonesia. Cell Culture and KHV Virus KF-1 cells were used in this study. KF-1 cells were grown in T-flasks at 25\u00b0C to confluence incubated at 25\u00b0C. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was daily observed under a light microscopy. The viral cultured was harvested when cytopathic effect (CPE) had reached \u00b1 80%. Supernatant was taken and stored at -80\u00b0C until ready to use and mostly used for the measurement of TCID50. TCID50 Determination of tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was performed to quantify how much infec- tious virus was in a vaccine preparation. TCID50 cal- culation was based on the method of Reed & Muench (1938): Where: a= % positive at dilution below 50% b= % positive at dilution above 50% Production of Vaccines The harvested virus was inactivated refers to Yasumoto et al. (2006) with minor modifications. Unlike what did Yasumoto in common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) where the cell is inactivated with 0.3% formalin and stored for 48 hours at a temperature of 24\u00b0C before use. The vaccine in this study are inactivated with for- malin 0.1% of the KHV virus then filtered using a 450 nm millipore and directly used for the test.Adjuvants was substances added to vaccines to stimulate the immune response. Differences between CFA and IFA contained in the composition of the constituent material which was in 1 mL CFA consisted of 1 mg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the form of heat-killed/dried; 0.85 mL of paraffin oil ; and 0.15 mL mannide monooleate . However M. tuberculosis not con- tained in the IFA. The comparison between either complete or in- complete adjuvant and vaccine solution were 0.25/ 0.75 (v/v). The composition of adjuvant and vaccine was obtained from Agar Gel Precipitation Test (AGPT) which carried out previously. Vaccination Vaccination was performed by the method of in- tramuscularly injection with a volume of 0.1 mL/fish. The experimental design was Completely Random- ized Design with five treatments and four replica- tions as follows: treatment A: vaccines; treatment B: vaccine + Complete Freund's Adjuvant ; treatment C: vaccine + Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant ; K+: positive control (injected with PBS, tested challenged); K-: negative control (injected with PBS, challenged not tested). Fish were reared in plastic container sized 60 cm x 70 cm x 40 cm with stocking density of 15 fish container-1. Water temperature was range at 24\u00b0C- 25\u00b0C and fed with a pellet twice a day at satiation . The fourth replications in each treatment used for blood and serum sampling. Challenge Test Challenge test was performed on day 21 after vaccination and maintenance carried out for 14 days post challenge test. The fish were injected intramus- cularly with 0.1 mL of virus inucula/fish. Virus was diluted up to 100 times (10-2) of TCID50/mL have been done previously. TCID50 already used to obtain Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) from the Koch's postulates. Koch postulate test was done with serial dilutions using TCID50 dose without dilution, times and TCID50 dilution 10,000 times. Koch's postulates test showed that the LD50 was obtained on TCID50 dilution 100 times. Dose of 100 times of virus dilu- tion then was used for a challenge test by injecting 0.1 mL each fish. Measurement of Immunological Parameters Measurement parameters of the immunological system consists of antibody titer by ELISA, hematocrit, and lysozyme activity. aba 50%TCID5043Indonesian Aquaculture Journal, 11 (1), 2016, 41-47 Preparation of antigen for the ELISA test con- ducted prior to the KHV virus purification process according to Ronen et al. (2003). Purified protein of KHV antigen was measured by the method of Bradford. Antigen was coated 10 ug/mL in each well and incu- bated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Directly plate was blocked using 200 \u00b5L of PBS-BSA 1% and incubated at 22\u00b0C for one hour. Plate was washed three times with 400 \u00b5L of PBS-T. Serum samples were then added to each well of 200 \u00b5L (Duplo) and incubated at a tempera- ture of 22\u00b0C for three hours. Plate was washed three times with 400 \u00b5L of PBS-T. Koi carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) antibody (AQUATIC Diagnostics Ltd.) added about 100 \u00b5L in each well and incubated at 22\u00b0C for one hour. Plate was washed three times with 400 \u00b5L of PBS-T. Anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase antibody produced in rabbit (SIGMA-ALDRICH) was added to each well of 100 \u00b5L and incubated at 22\u00b0C for one hour. Plate was washed three times with 400 \u00b5L of PBS-T. One-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA was further added to each well of 100 \u00b5L and let stand for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u00b5L H2SO42M and do the reading optical density (OD) at 450 nm. The cut of value (CV) in this test was obtained by the equation: CV = Mean negative control + (2 x standard deviation) Hematocrit measurement is done by comparing a part of blood that settles (a) to all parts of the blood contained in the microhematocrit tube (b), hema- tocrit levels expressed as % volume solid blood cells were calculated by using the equation of: Measurement of lysozyme was conducted accord- ing the method of Kafilzadeh (2013) which 10 \u00b5L of plasma added into 190 \u00b5L liquid suspension of Micro- coccus lysodeicticus (Sigma) at 25\u00b0C. lysozyme x (1/(t p)) where: 1,000 was conversion of the absorbance (OD) into international units (UI), t was time (minute), p was plasma volume (mL), OD 30s is optical density readings on 30 seconds, OD 30m is optical density readings on 30 minutes Survival Rate (SR)where: Nt was the number of live koi at the end of the observation, No was the number of koi in the initial observation Relative Percent Survival (RPS) Statistical Analysis Results are presented as Means \u00b1 SD (standard deviation of means) and homogenic data was per- form before analysis. The SPSS (Version, 20.0) pro- grams were used for the statistical analyses. One- way analysis of variance (One-way ANOVA) was used to determine whether there were any significant differences between treatments. If so, all treatments were further tested by Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT). All test were performed at the 95% confi- dence interval (P 0.05) RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Survival Rate Survival of fish among treatments were signifi- cantly different (P<0.05). All fish in K- treatment (nega- tive control) survived until the end of the study. This was in contrast with the treatment of K+ (positive control) where at the end of the study fish alive only 15.55%. Fish in treatment A (vaccine), B (vaccine + CFA), and C (vaccine + IFA) successively survival of 68.88%, 82.22%, and 60.00%. The highest survival was achieved by treatment B. Value of survival and rela- tive survival were shown in Table 1. Relative Percent Survival While relative survival of both treatment A and C are not significantly different, but A and C signifi- cantly different with B (P<0.05). The highest relative survival was achieved by treatment B, its the same thing with the achievements of the percentage of survival. The survival of control fish were significantly different (P<0.05) compared with other treatments (Table 1). It indicates that vaccination improved sur- vival of fish. All fish in the negative control alive from the beginning to the end of the study, and unlike the case with the positive control, in which the remaining fish was only 15.55 \u00b1 3.84%. The highest survival was achieved by treatment vaccination with the addition of Complete Freund's Adjuvant /CFA (treat- ment B), followed by vaccine treatment (treatment A) and then treated with additional vaccinations In-100% x baHe 100% x NoNt(%) SR100 x control mortality Fish %vaccinated of mortality fish %1 RPS 44Potency and efficacy test of a vaccine in addition with adjuvant ..... (Lili Sholichah) complete Freund's Adjuvant / IFA (treatment C). The addition of the adjuvant vaccine was found to further increase the survival of fish than just vaccine only. It is shown that B was significantly different (P<0.05) with A and in accordance with the opinion of Kuby (2007), that the adjuvant is a substance when mixed with antigen then injected together will work to improve the immunogenicity of the antigen. While the effectiveness of the vaccine protection can also be seen from the relative survival in Table 1. The highest survival was achieved by treatment B followed treatment A and C. The treatments A was significantly different (P<0.05) with C. RPS were obtained in the treatment of vaccination meet the range for effective protection in the process ofvaccination unless treatment C (52.63 \u00b1 7.89%). This is in line with Amend (1981) that for effective pro- tection RPS suggested value of more than 60%. Based on the results of this study it is not advisable to use C treatment because C does not meet the minimum limit the effectiveness of vaccine protection. ELISA Assay Vaccination aims to induce long-term immunity by stimulating specific components of the immune response is an antibody by inducing the formation of specific antibody. Figure 1 shows absorbance of vaccinated koi higher than the control. Before vacci- nation antibody titers tend to be similar and not sig- nificantly different (P>0.05) among treatments. TheTable 1.

Absorbance values of K+ and K- during the study were below the CV , indicates that no protective antibodies against KHV. Positive anti-KHV antibodies formed in all treat- ments vaccination from 14 to 35 dpv. Anti-KHV anti- bodies begin to form at 7 dpv namely in treatment A and C as indicated by intersect to the line CV (Figure 1). While on treatment B had positive anti- bodies directly even reach the top of the formation of antibodies. This is presumably due to the effect of the vaccine and the addition of adjuvants in vaccines. Antibody formation is influenced by several factors such as temperature, dose of the vaccine, vaccine administration, the age, and weight of fish as well as the nature of the antigen (Ellis, 1988). The use of adjuvants capable of increasing the titer two times higher than without adjuvant (De Jong et al., 2003). In addition, adjuvants are also able to create a balance of humoral antibody response (Hunter, 2002). It shows that the inserted antigen be antigenic as capable of inducing an immune response to an in- crease in the value of antibody titers at vaccination treatment.Hematocrit Level Hematocrit level can be seen in Figure 2. Prior to vaccination and one week after vaccination there was no significant difference among treatments (P>0.05). At 14 dpv, there are significant differences (P<0.05) between K+, K-, C with A and B. The highest hema- tocrit levels achieved on day 21 dpv in treatment B and significantly different (P<0.05) with other treat- ments. At 28 dpv and 35 dpv hematocrit levels de- creased but treatment B was the highest and signifi- cantly different with other treatments (P<0.05). Hematocrit is the percentage ratio between the solid red blood cells and plasma in the blood. Gene- rally hematocrit before vaccination and one week af- ter vaccination tend to be low and stable (Figure 2). Entering the second week (14 dpv) hematocrit of treat- ment A and B slightly higher and significantly different (P<0.05) with the control and C. While the hematocrit reached the highest peak in the third week (21 dpv) is achieved by B. In normal conditions, he- matocrit levels of carp ranged from 32% to 43.8% (Radu, 2009). Shortly after the challenge test, hematocrit levels increased and then begin to decline until the end of the maintenance period. Decrease in hema- tocrit levels after challenge test showed that KHV infection that attacks fish is quite serious. Factors Figure 2.

This decrease was associated with hemorrhage in the base of the fin and bleeding in the brain. Lysozyme Activity Figure 3 shows lysozyme activity of fish. B efore vaccination, the amount of lysozyme activity was not significantly different among treatments (P>0.05). Lysozyme value of K+ and K- is significantly different (P<0.05) with A and C and also significantly different with the treatment B on the 7 dpv. At 14 dpv treat- ment K+ and K- significantly different compared 21 dpv the activity of lysozyme reached the highest peak in treatment B and significantly different from other treatments. A week after the challenge test (28 dpv) each lysozyme activity decreased and continue to decrease till 35 dpv. Treatment B still shows higher but not significantly different with treatment A (P>0.05) and significantly different (P<0.05) with K+, K-, and C. Lysozyme is an important component in the de- fence system against pathogens. Lysozyme in fish can be detected from the serum, mucus, plasma, andorgans such as gills and liver. Figure 3 shows the activity of lysozyme in general tends to increase after vaccination and tends to decrease after challenge test. Vaccination treatment can increase the activity of lysozyme and significantly different (P<0.05) with the controls. Increased activity of this enzyme is also obtained in tilapia injected ECP Pseudomonas fluorescens (Attia et al., 2012). According Saurabh & Sahoo (2008) lysozyme is a distributed hydrolase, and plays an im- portant role in the biological defense system. This enzyme has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflamma- tory properties. In addition, increase lysozyme activity closely associated with humoral factors that can increase phagocytic activity in fish (Veersamy et al., 2014). On the positive control (K+) is very clearly visible decrease in the activity of lysozyme after chal- lenge test. Lysozyme in fish is an indicator of non- specific immune response to the invasion of anti- gens. Lysozyme is the first layer of defense mecha- nism that is very important for fish to fight patho- gens (Saurabh & Sahoo, 2008). Lysozyme can increase phagocytic as opsonin or directly activate neutrophils and macrophages (Bhagwat et al., 2010).Figure 3.
