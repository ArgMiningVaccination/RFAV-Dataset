Support from the NIH will help the company make therapeutic molecules to block the activity of an HPV-specific protein important for its replication, preventing continued infection and the potential for development of cancer. This Phase I award, for about $225,000, will be administered by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease to identify drug-like molecules that inhibit the HPV-16 E6 protein. E6 is essential for viral replication and instrumental in bypassing host cell defenses and preventing apoptosis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, human papillomavirus affects about 79 million men and women in the U.S. Zhijian Lu, Ph.D. and CEO of Sunnylife Pharma, said there are no effective medical therapies for HPV. \"Those with persistent infections of specific subtypes are at a high risk for several cancers that often metastasize and account for 5 percent of cancers worldwide,\" Lu said. \"HPV vaccines are of no use to those already infected, are out of reach financially for economically disadvantaged countries, and it is unknown whether the vaccines will provide complete coverage over a long timeframe.\" These funds will be invested alongside Sunnylife Pharma resources to help develop small molecule therapeutics against HPV. Alison Strack, Ph.D. and chief scientific officer, will be the principal investigator and work in close collaboration with Dr. Elliot J. Androphy and Kampen-Norins professor and chair, Department of Dermatology at Indiana University School of Medicine. Sunnylife Pharma is located in the Purdue Research Park of Indianapolis.
