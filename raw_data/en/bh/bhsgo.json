According to Ayurveda , fasting helps attune oneself by establishing a more harmonious relationship between the body and the soul. This is necess ary for our well being as it ultimately nourishes both our physical and spiritual needs. Ayurvedic View The Ayurvedic medical system views the basic cause of many diseases as the accumulation of undi- gested and toxic materials called Ama . Ama becomes lodged in the digestive system, where it is then absorbed into the body to accumulate, spread and do harm. Regular cleansing of Ama keeps one healthy. By fasting, the digestive organs rest and all body mechanisms are cleansed and corrected, en- ergy is created; the body is made light, the senses sharpened, and health preserved. Since the human body is composed of 75% water, like the earth, the presence of toxins in our fluid body causes physical and emotional imbalances making some people tense, irritable, impatient and in the extreme, violent. Fasting acts as an antidote by clearing and regulating the fluid body, thus reducing the toxic load and acid content in the body. Emotional and physical equilibrium are the result. Ayurveda views disease as the accumulation and aggravation of one or more of the doshas (Vata , Pitta and Kapha ), which also spread from their normal place in the gastrointestinal track into the body tissues and create imbalance . As the doshas accumulate in excess they may combine with Ama to cre- ate an even more complicated condition. Fasting and cleansing is an easy method to control the over accumulation of the doshas. It is recommended to fast and cleanse under the guidance of an Ayurve- dic practitioner once to twice per year with the change of the seasons. Kitchari as Cleansing Food Ayurveda most often relies on a simple porridge like dish called kitchari to sustain the body during fasts. Kitchari means \"mixture\", usually of two grains. Kitchari is a particularly nourishing and very easy to di- gest mono -diet, and a perfect staple food to use during periods of cleansing. The two grains used, bas- mati rice and split mung dal, mixed with ghee (or sesame oil), provide the essential carbohydrates, pro- tein and clean essential fatty acids needed to sustain the body during a fast. Kitchari provides the mini- mal nutrients needed allowing us to avoid all of the questionable foods in our diet known to produce Ama . In short, kitchari is Ama reducing by virtue of being easy to digest. A kitchari fast is much less radical than a water fast and it allow s for an extended fasting time by main- taining basic cellular nutrition. The point is not to prove how long you can go without food, but to give the body enough time away from Ama producing foods so that the cleansing herbs and other detoxify- ing methods can do their work.

The Kitchari Fasting Period The fasting, or kitchari consuming, period should be for at least 3 days (for high Vata types especially), but may be as long as 10 to 20 depending on your constitution (stronger Kapha and Pitta types), work- load, and how you feel from day to day. Plan to do only light work during the course of the fast and only as much exercise as feels appropriate. Yoga is ideal. Walks, hikes in nature, meditation, and pra- nayama breathing exercises are also ideal for fasting times. The deepest cleansing process takes place during the kitchari fasting period. The longer it has been since you cleansed last the longer you may want to cleanse. Usually the process is complete in 3 to 5 days. Others may want to go longer if you wish to go deeper and lose weight, or if you have an imbal- anced over attachment to unhealthy foods. Besides reducing Ama , you will be cleansed of emotional attachments to the unhealthy foods in your life. Transition Days The kitchari fasting period is preceded and followed by 3 transitional days of very clean, organic and vegetarian eating with reduced food intake. An emphasis on steamed vegetables is preferred, though vegetable soups and a light quantity of basmati rice and fruit may be included. No animal products of any kind are allowed. The initial transitional days (Days 1-3) serve to prepare the body for the kitchari phase of the cleanse and include two procedures used to loosen and purge the intestinal Ama . These practices are known as Snehana and Virechana (see below). The transition days also work to prepare the mind for letting go of its favorite foods and attachments (coffee, sugar, chocolate, fast food, etc.). To properly select your vegetables refer to the Ayurvedic Food Guideline sheet for the foods favorable to the most dominant dosha you are intending to reduce. If you are in a caffeine habit it is advisable that you reduce the in- take of caffeine fradually leading up to the claense to avoid headache and distress. Snehana: Internal Oleation Snehana involves the ingestion of ghee (some practitioners prefer sesame oil) each morning, which serves to loosen sticky, fat soluble toxins and help to direct them towards the intestinal track. This pro- cess takes roughly three days to complete. Dharmanaut LLC Kitchari Cleanse 3 Snehana instructions Day 1: between 6-7 am, take 1 TBSP oil or ghee in \u00bc cup hot water Day 2: between 6-7 am, take 2 TBSP oil or ghee in \u00bc cup hot water Day 3: between 6-7 am, take 3 TBSP oil or ghee in \u00bc cup hot water The oil or ghee should be taken in liquid form on an empty stomach . 1/2 hour after taking the ghee , have a glass of warm water . If you feel slightly nauseous, have a glass of warm water with fresh lemon juice. Virechana - use of a strong laxative (castor oil) to purge the body of impurities Once Snehana loosens the Ama, Virechana flushes it from the body . A one time purgative procedure produced by the ingestion of castor oil on the evening of Day 3. This procedure does not remove all Ama from the body, but helps to clean the major toxins that weaken the digestive forces and by result the body will more effic iently digest the kitchari without further Ama production. At this point the kitchari can sustain the body while the detoxifying herbs work to scour Ama from the deeper tissues. Virechana instructions On the evening of Day 3 have a very light meal. Before bedtime, enjoy a 20-30 minute hot bath or shower . Then take 3 TBSP of CASTOR OIL. Put the Castor Oil in 1/2 cup of warm water. Cut an orange open. Squeeze in the juice from 1/2 orange into the cup, and stir to blend. Drink mixture all at once! Now bite into the other orange for a few seconds. The laxative effects will normally occur between 4-6 hours on the average. Expect to be awakened in the early morning by an urgent need to eliminate. Morning of Day 4 Dietary Guidelines 1. Don't eat until the majority of the laxative effect has worn off. 2. If you feel light and strong, proceed to making and eating your kitchari for breakfast. 3. If you feel weak, try warm water and juice (not grape), rest, then proceed to kitchari for lunch. Pay attention to the number of bowel movements you have after taking the laxative. Count each trip to the bathroom as one bowel movement. See the chart below to help dictate your diet. No bowel movements: Take more castor oil. Repeat above procedure during the mid morning. 1 - 3 bowel movements: This is the average. Follow the Dietary Guidelines above. 4+ bowel movements: Take your first kitchari for breakfast with plenty of warm water and honey. Observances Observe the following throughout the transition and detoxification phases: Drink 3 to 4 glasses of plain hot water per day. This is very important! Take 1 to 2 (10 - 20 minutes) hot baths or steamy showers per day. Steam room at spa or gym is OK. This serves to dilate blood vessels and the subtle channels, thus allowing toxins to be more efficiently removed. During the transitions days (1 to 3, and 9 to 11 above) eat only basmati rice and steamed vege- tables appropriate to your treatment protocols (i.e., pacifying to the dominant dosha being treated). Do NOT overeat. Dharmanaut LLC Kitchari Cleanse 4 Only eat the recommended foods and drinks prescribed for your cleanse. Eat if you're hungry don't if you're not. Avoid strenuous activity. A gentle home yoga practice is perfect. Avoid exposure to the cold, stay warm, especially head and neck. Herbs and supplements are to be taken only as advised. Please continue any normal prescription meds as advised by your physician. Detoxifying Herbal Therapies The classic Ayurvedic formula, Triphala , is used during the transition phases to assist in the cleansing of the intestinal track. Triphala also serves as a mild laxative and stool softener to improve digestive transit and optimal elimination. Stronger variations of the formula, such as Triphala Guggulu , may be pre- scribed during the kitchari consuming phase of the cleanse. Take Triphala only as prescribed. Common Experiences and Bodily Sensations of Detoxification Everyone responds to fasting and cleansing differently. Some feel euphoric and some struggle. Maybe a little bit of both. Everyone will experience some mild discomfort, or withdrawal from a food or habitu- ated substance and finish with a more vibrant and clear body and mind. Longer fasts (7+ days of kitchari) intending to lose weight may bring an unexpected increase in Vata dosha and its qualities, such as anxiety, nervousness, dryness and coldness, lightheadedness, an un- grounded and impulsive cravings for comfort foods such as sweets, salty foods, chocolates, or familiar foods from childhood). If so, increase the amount of kitchari modestly until the sensation goes away. By the second or third day you should begin to experience more energy and feel lighter in your body. That is a sign that the body is cleansing and beginning to function more optimally without aggravating Vata. Those on a long -term weight reducing protocol may also feel a sensation of warmth. That is the body working to access its reserves of energy in the layers of body fat. The process is known as thermogene- sis, in which the metabolic rate increases, burning fat to release heat as energy - this is a good thing for weight loss. It's not unusual to lose 10 pounds or more during spring fasts. You will know when a fast is complete when you feel and experience the following: regular bowel movements no gas clean tongue (no coating) fresh breath no lethargy or heaviness in the body and mind lightness in the body with good energy a general sense of happiness After you break the fast you may enjoy eating light for some time. An occasional mini fast with kitchari for a day here and there is suggested in the weeks following the fast. Should you feel an impulse to in- dulge in old habits , a mini fast serves to further break the link with that food. Ayurveda recognizes that each person is uniquely different. Follow your body wisdom. Listen to its re- quests. However, know the difference between a true bodily need and an impulse for something habit- uated to the mind. "}
