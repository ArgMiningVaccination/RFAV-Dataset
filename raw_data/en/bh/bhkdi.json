Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the prep aration and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles ge nerally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal contro l relevant to the prepara tion and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from ma terial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these conso lidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated fi nancial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain au dit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selec ted depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the cons olidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessmen ts, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit al so includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the r easonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presenta tion of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated September 30, 2021 on our consideration of Cincinnati Children's internal contro l over financial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Cincinnati Children's inte rnal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 7 (1) Accounting Policies - (a) Basis of Consolidation - Children's Hospital Medi cal Center (Cincinnati Children's), River City Insurance Limited (River City), CHMC Community Health Services Network (CHSN), Burnet BACE Properties LLC (BACE) and Avondale Rentals LLC (Avondale Rentals), which ar e under common management, are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as Cincinnati Children's. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Cincinnati Children's is an Ohio not-for-profit co rporation providing pediatric healthcare services, education, and related research. River City is a captive insurance company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Children's. CHSN is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Children's whose purpose is to manage primar y care practices in a community setting. Burnet, TSHCH, DTPM2, BACE and Avondale Rentals are who lly owned subsidiaries of Cincinnati Children's whose purpose is to hold land. (b) Supporting Organizations - The Children's Hosp ital (TCH) and Convalescent Hospital Fund for Children (CHFC) are both Ohio not-for-profit corporati ons that provide financial support to Cincinnati Children's. Effective March 19, 2021, CHFC ch anged the name of The Convalescent Hospital for Children and Orphan Asylum (CHCOA) to the Convalescent Hospital Fund for Children. The TCH and CHFC purpose clauses both specify the support of Cincinnati Children's as the organization's sole purpose. Additionally, certain endowment funds of these supporting organizations are restricted by the donors for specific operating pu rposes of Cincinnati Children's. As such, the assets of TCH and CHFC are recorded in Cincinnati Childre n's consolidated financial statements as an increase in Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organiza tions and an increase in Net Assets with Donor Restrictions. Changes in the fair value of Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations are recorded as a Gain in Interest in Net Assets of Supporti ng Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. The majority of receipts are from TCH and CHFC donor-restricted endowment funds or are other receipts that are designated by the supporting orga nizations' Boards of Trustees for specific operating purposes. The receipts are reflected in Gifts, contribu tions and other income with donor restrictions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Opera tions and Changes in Net Assets. Upon spending, such funds are reflected in Other restricted net ass ets used to support operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Other receipts are from TCH as designated by the sup porting organization's Board of Trustees to provide general support. The receipts are reflected in R eceipts from supporting organizations without donor restrictions in the accompanying Consolidated Statem ents of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 8 (c) Support Received from Supporting Organizations - TCH and CHFC provi de annual support to Cincinnati Children's through transfers of dividend and interest earnings on investments, net of investment management fees, administrative expe nses, and donor-required income reinvestments. The Supporting Organizations' respective Boards of Tr ustees may also make certain pledges of principal without donor restriction in support of key projects or initiatives at Cincinnati Children's. In January 2020, CHFC's Board of Trustees made a gift in the amount of $36,000 to support the construction of a new facility at the College Hill Campus and programmatic support of Cincinnati Children's Pursuing our Potential in Mental Health initiative. The agreement has ce rtain criteria that represent donor- imposed conditions that must be overcome befo re Cincinnati Children's is entitled to the assets promised. A contribution of $1,855 was made for the year ended June 30, 2021. The receipts are reflected in Gifts, contributions and other income with donor restrictions and in Net assets used for purchase of property and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. The following table details transfers between Cinci nnati Children's and Supporting Organizations in the Consolidated Statements of Opera tions and Changes in Net Assets: 2021 2020 Transfers of net assets with donor restrictions included in Gifts, contributions and other income: Cincinnati Children's from TCH $ 103,074 6,280 3,867 Total 109,354 92,141 Transfers of net assets without donor restrictions included in Receipts from (Transfers to) supporting organizations: Cincinnati Children's from TCH 3,757 3,475 (1) (37,181) (108,625) Total (33,424) (105,150) Receivables at June 30 Cincinnati Children's from TCH (2) - 10,587 Total $ - $ 10,587 (1) The purpose of this transfer is to establish fu nds designated to support divisional activities and strategic priorities. (2) This receivable relates to an expected paymen t upon the maturity of a life insurance policy. The policy matured in fiscal year 2021, and proceeds were transferred to Cincinnati Children's. (d) Revenue Recognition - The following revenue streams are subject to the revenue recognition guidance in Accounting Standards Codification No. 606 (ASC 606) \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\": 2021 2020 Net 207,082 220,386 $2,433,772 $2,280,553 Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 9 Net Patient Service Revenue Cincinnati Children's net patient ser vice revenue generally relates to contracts with patients in which the performance obligations are to pr ovide health care services to patients. As patients simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of health care provided by Cincinnati Children's, the performance obligations meet the criteria to be satisfied over time. Net patient service revenue is recorded as services are provided. Payment for such services is due between thirty to forty-five days from payer receipt of claim. Consideration for patient service revenue is va riable. Agreements with payers typically provide for payments at amounts less than established charges. Effective January 1, 2021, Cincinnati Children's si gned an agreement with an Ohio Medicaid managed care company in which performance obligations are to stand-ready to provide care for approximately 130,000 children. The performance obligation to st and-ready is satisfied over time. Cincinnati Children's is reimbursed under a variable capitati on methodology for hospital services. All physician and home care services are reimbursed based on pr ovider fee schedules. The hospital services are reimbursed through a variable capitation payment wh ich represents the amount remaining after payment has been made for (a) Cincinnati Children's phys ician services, (b) Cincinnati Children's home care services, (c) services provided to members by facilities outside the Cincinnati Children's network, and (d) an actuarially determined accrual for incurred but not reported claims (see Note 1h). Under delegation agreements, Cincinnati Children's receives fixed payments to perfo rm the required medical management, care management and care coordination functions. Medi caid managed care organizations retain risk for payments to providers. The amount of net patient service revenue recorded in fiscal year 2021 under this arrangement is $103,836. Laws and regulations concerning g overnment programs, including Medicaid and Medicare, are complex and subject to varying interpretation. As a result of investigations by governmental agencies, various health care organizations have received request s for information and notices regarding alleged noncompliance with those laws and re gulations, which, in some instances, have resulted in organizations entering into significant settlement agreements. Compli ance with such laws and regulations may also be subject to future government review and interpre tation as well as significant regulatory action, including fines, penalties, and potential exclusion from re lated programs. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not challenge Cincin nati Children's compliance with these laws and regulations, and it is not possible to determine the im pact (if any) such claims or penalties would have upon Cincinnati Children's. In addition, the contract s Cincinnati Children's has with third party payers also provide for retroactive audit and review of cl aims. At June 30, 2021, Cincinnati Children's has settled all Medicaid cost reports through 2016 and all Medicar e cost reports through 2019. Settlements with third party payers for retroactive ad justments due to audits, reviews or investigations are considered variable consideration and are incl uded in the determination of estimated transaction price for providing patient care. These settlement s are based on the terms of the payment agreement with the payer, correspondence from the payer, and Ci ncinnati Children's historical settlement activity, including an assessment to ensure that it is proba ble that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Estim ated settlements are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known based on new information or as years are settled and no longer subject to such audits, reviews, and investigations. Adjustme nts arising from a change in transaction price were not material in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Generally, patients who are covered by third party payers are responsible for related deductibles and coinsurance, which vary in amount. Cincinnati Child ren's also provides services to uninsured patients and offers those uninsured patients a discount, either by policy or law, from standard charges. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 10 Children's estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance and from those who are uninsured based on historical experience a nd current market conditions. The initial estimate of the transaction price is determined by reducing the standard charge by established contractual adjustments, discounts, and implicit price concessi ons. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to patient service revenue in the period of change. Consistent with Cincinnati Children's mission, care is provided to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Therefore, Cincinnati Children's has determin ed it has provided implicit price concessions to uninsured patients and patients with other uninsured balances. The implicit price concessions included in estimating the transaction price represent the di fference between the amounts billed to patients and the amounts Cincinnati Children's expects to collect based on its collection history with those patients. Patients who meet Cincinnati Children's criteria for ch arity care are provided care without charge or at amounts less than established rates. Amounts determin ed to qualify as charity care are not reported as net patient service revenue. Because the majority of its performance obligations re late to contracts with a duration of less than one year, Cincinnati Children's has elected to apply the optional exemption provided in FASB ASC 606- 10-50-14(a) and, therefore, is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the fiscal year. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied pe rformance obligations referred to above are primarily related to inpatient acute care services at the end of the fiscal year. The performance obligations for these contracts are generally completed when patient s are discharged, which generally occurs shortly after the end of the fiscal year. In both fiscal years 2021 and 2020, substantially all of net patient service revenue is derived from third- party payment programs (Medicaid, insurance comp anies and various managed care agreements). Cincinnati Children's classifies its patients by pa yer. The following table disaggregates Cincinnati Children's net patient service revenue by payer categor ies for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 Commercial insurers the percentage of accounts re ceivable by payer category as of June 30, 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 Commercial insurers 2% 3% 1% 2% 1 Specialty contracts are single case agreements or co ntracts for specialty services, such as transplants. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 11 Other Revenue Cincinnati Children's other revenue ge nerally relates to contracts with external organizations in which the performance obligations are to provide research services or other various fee-for-service arrangements outside the scope of healthcare serv ices. Relief funds received as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (C ARES) Act are also included in other revenue. See Note 1(s) for further discussion on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Revenue from industry contracts and certain govern ment contracts is earned based on performance obligations to provide research services to the ex ternal organizations. License and royalty revenue relates to contracts with other organizations in which our performance obligations are to provide intellectual property to the organization. Revenue is also earned for various other contracted fee-for- service arrangements where services are performed fo r external organizations outside the scope of healthcare services for Cincinnati Children's patie nts. Performance obligations for industry and government contracts, license and royalty contracts, and various other fee-fo r-service arrangements are satisfied over time. Consideration is fixed based on c ontracted price, and there is no significant variable consideration related to these agreements. (e) Graduate Medical Education - Cincinnati Children' s receives Federal gradua te medical education funding. Other revenue of $11,188 and $10,832 was recognized for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (f) Tax Exempt Status - Cincinnati Children's and CHSN are recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as exempt from federal income taxes under Section 5 01(a) of the Internal Revenue Code as charitable organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3). Ri ver City is a captive insurance company and has no income tax obligations. Burnet, TSHCH, DTPM2, BACE and Avondale Rentals are limited liability corporations whose income is taxable to Cincinnati Children's. The income tax provisions recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are immaterial for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Cincinnati Children's accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC) 740 \"Income Taxes\". It is Cincinnati Ch ildren's policy to classify the expense related to interest and penalties, if any, to be paid on underp ayments of income taxes within other expenses. There were no material penalties or interest recognized in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Fiscal years 2018 through 2021 are subject to ex amination by both the Federal and State tax jurisdictions. (g) Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents consist primar ily of money market inv estments (including money market mutual funds) and demand de posits. Money market investments have maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Cash is held primarily in two financial institutions. (h) Inventories and Prepaid Expenses - Inventorie s consist primarily of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals and are valued on an average cost method. As part of Cincinnati Children's variable capita tion agreement, reimbursement is reduced by an actuarially determined estimate for incurred but not reported claims. Cincinnati Children's recorded incurred but not reported claims of approximately $21,107 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The estimate is recorded as an increas e in prepaid expenses and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 12 (i) Marketable Securities - Cincinnati Children's accounts for its investments under ASC 958-320 \"Not- for-Profit ASC 958-321 \"Not-for-Profit Entities - Investments - Equity Securities.\" Cincinnati Children' s carries its marketable securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in invest ment income in the acco mpanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, Cinci nnati Children's marketable securities included 19% and 20% in U.S. Treasury securities, respectively. (j) Property and Equipment - Property a nd equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to forty years, as follows: Land Improvements 3-25 years Buildings and Building Improvements 5-40 years Equipment 3-25 years Cincinnati Children's evaluates long-lived assets under the provisions of ASC 360 \"Property Plant and Equipment.\" During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, Cinci nnati Children's did not incur any losses related to impairment of property and equipment. (k) Goodwill - Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price ove r the fair value of the net assets of an entity acquired. Cincinnati Children's acquired the assets of a pediatric primary care practice, resulting in goodwill of $8,583 in fiscal year 2021, and elected to apply the accounting alternatives available for not-for-profit entities. Goodwill is amortized over a 10- year period and tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs. During fiscal year 2021, $429 of amortization expense and no impairment losses were recognized. (l) Leases - Cincinnati Children's leases property and equipment under finance and operating leases. Cincinnati Children's determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets and lease obligations are recognized for leases with terms greater than 12 months based on the net present value of the future minimum lease payments over the le ase term at commencement date. When readily determinable, Cincinnati Children's uses the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present value of future minimum lease payments. However, most of Cincinnati Children's leases do not have a readily determinable implicit interest rate. For th ese leases, Cincinnati Children's uses a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the period and cash payment stream comparable with that of each lease. The right-of-use asset and lease obligations include a value for options to extend a lease if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. The current portion of operating lease obligations is included in the current portion of long-term debt and lease obligations and the non-current portion is separately stated as operating lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The related right-o f-use assets are included in operating lease right-of- use assets on the consolidated balan ce sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is in cluded in purchased services in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 13 The current portion of finance lease obligations is included in current porti on of long-term debt and lease obligations and the non-current portion is separ ately broken out as finance lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. The related finance lease right-of-use assets are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease right-of-use assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter period of th e lease term or the estimated useful life of the property or equipment. Such amortization expense is included in depreciation in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. (m) Costs of Borrowing - Interest incurred on borrowed funds, net of interest earned on restricted bond funds, during the period of construction of capital asset s is capitalized as a component of the cost of acquiring those assets. In fiscal years 2021 and 20 20, Cincinnati Children's capitalized $11,013 and $6,201 of interest related to cons truction in progress, respectively. Total cash paid for interest was approximately $33,655 and $3 0,130 and in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Deferred bond issuance costs and issuance premiums are amortized using the effective interest method over the period the related obligation is outstanding. (n) Interest Rate Swap Agreement - In fiscal year 2020, Cincinnati Children's entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk associ ated with the variable rate 2018Z and 2018AA bonds. The swap agreement is measu red at fair value and recognized in th e Consolidated Balance Sheets within other long-term liabilities. Cincinnati Children's r ecognizes gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement as non-ope rating gains and losses within net investment return on the Consolidated Statements of Op erations and Changes in Net Assets. (o) Net Asset Classifications - Cincinnati Children's re ports its financial position and activities according to the following net asset classifications: Net assets without donor restrictions - Net assets that are not subject to donor-imposed restrictions and may be expended for any purpose in performing the primary objective of the organization are classified as net assets without donor restrictions. These net assets may be used at the discretion of management of Cincinnati Children's. Net assets with donor restrictions - Net assets subj ect to stipulations imposed by donors or supporting organizations are classified as net assets with donor restrictions. Some restrictions are temporary in nature; those restrictions will be met by fulfilling a certain purpose or by the passage of time. Other donor restrictions are perpetual in nature, whereby the donor has stipulated the principal be maintained in perpetuity. (Continued on next page) Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 14 Net assets with donor restrictions are comprised of the following: 2021 2020 Subject to expenditure for specified purpose: Clinical 40,342 $ 36,377 Research 93,558 23,366 195,224 164,933 Subject to expenditure for specified purpose, at supporting organizations: Research 15,507 11,874 Education 3,526 21,255 16,276 Subject to expenditure based on Board discretion of the supporting organization, held at supporting organizations 2,202,814 1,648,127 2,202,814 1,648,127 Investment in perpetuity, the income from which is expendable for specified purpose, held at Cincinnati Children's: Clinical 917 381 Research 17,929 12,803 Education 1,352 999 General Administration and Othe r 3,000 1,893 23,198 16,076 Investment in perpetuity, the income from which is expendable for specified purpose, held at supporting organizations: Clinical 46,872 34,946 Research 2,099,458 60,430 2,319,643 1,754,675 Subject to appropriation and expenditure when a specified event occurs: Upon death of insured party 1,958 16,561 1,958 16,561 Total net assets with donor restrictions $4,764,092 $3,616,648 (Continued on next page) Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 15 (p) Revenue and Gains in Excess of Expenses and Losses - Th e Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets subtotals operating revenues, gains and other support, operating expenses and nonoperating gains as Revenue and gains in excess of expenses and losses. Other changes in net assets without donor restrictions are receipts from and tr ansfers to supporting organi zations, pension and post- retirement health liability adjustments, and net assets released from restrictions used for purchase of property and equipment, which are excluded from Re venue and gains in excess of expenses and losses. (q) Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial st atements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of Ameri ca requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of as sets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (r) New Accounting Pronouncements - In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02 Leases . ASU 2016-02 introduces a new lessee model that brings substantially all lease obligations and assets onto the balance sheet. Most of the existing lessor principles are retained, but ASU 2016-02 aligns many of those principles with the FASB's new revenue guidance. Cincinnati Children's adopted ASU 2016-02 on July 1, 2019. Ci ncinnati Children's elected the transition package of practical expedients available in ASU 2016-02 wh ereby, upon adoption, an entity need not reassess expired or existing contracts to determine whether the contracts are or contain leases or to determine lease classification. Cincinnati Children's additiona lly elected the short-term lease recognition exemption, a practical expedient which permits a le ssee not to recognize on its balance sheet assets and liabilities related to leases whose leas e term is twelve months or l ess. The impact of adoption on the consolidated financial statements on July 1, 2019 resulted in an increase in other noncurrent assets to record right-of-use assets and an increase in other cu rrent and noncurrent liabilities to record lease obligations for operating leases of approximately $13,748 representing the present value of remaining lease payments of the operating leases. Additiona lly, Cincinnati Children's recorded a credit to beginning net assets without restriction of $8,651 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 did not have a material impact on the c onsolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets or consolidated statements of cash flows. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Re quirements for Fair Value Measurement . The ASU improves the effectiveness of the notes to financial statements through changes to disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. The ASU is effective for fi scal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with retrospective application. Cincinnati Children's adopt ed the standard for the year ended June 30, 2021, and there was no significant impact to the consolidat ed financial statements as a result of adoption. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Internal-Use Software. This standard aligns the requireme nts for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, which mean s that it will be effective for Cincinnati Children's in the fiscal year beginning Ju ly 1, 2021. Cincinnati Children's is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt the provisions upon the effective date. In September 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-07, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Presentation and Disclosures by Not-for-Profit Entities for Contributed Nonfinancial Assets . This ASU changes the presentation and disclosure requirements for not-for- profit entities to increase transparency about Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 16 contributed nonfinancial assets. The ASU is effectiv e for annual periods beginni ng after June 15, 2021, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after June 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Cincinnati Children's is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and will adopt th e provisions upon the effective date. In March 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-03, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Accounting Alternative for Evaluating Triggering Events. The standard allows not-for-profit entities with an accounting alternative to evaluate the facts and circumstan ces as of the end of each reporting period to determine whether a triggering event exists a nd, if so, whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. An entity that elects this alternative is not required to monitor for goodwill impairment triggering events durin g the reporting period. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 20 19. Cincinnati Children's adopted ASU 2021-03 effective July 1, 2020. Adopting ASU 2021-03 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. (s) COVID-19 Pandemic - An order was issued by the Oh io Department of Health, effective Wednesday, March 18, 2020, that required all non-essential or elect ive surgeries and procedures that utilized personal protective equipment (\"PPE\") be cancelled. As a resu lt of this order, Cincinnati Children's experienced a decline in patient volumes which significantly affect ed financial results for fiscal year 2020. This order was rescinded effective April 30, 2020. On May 1, Cincinnati Childre n's began its \"Responsible Recovery for Kids\" plan, which included the re scheduling of previously cancelled procedures and reopening outpatient clinics in a gradual, thou ghtful, and safe manner. Cincinnati Children's experienced a significant decline in inpatient days, outpatient visits and surgical cases during the period the order was in effect. The financial impact of these declines are reflect ed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Changes in Net Assets for fiscal year 2020. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secur ity (\"CARES\") Act was passed by Congress on March 27, 2020 to aid organization and individuals with the economic impacts of COVID-19. Cincinnati Children's received $50,000 and $42,4 04 in relief funds from the Depa rtment of Health and Human Services in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Relief funds are recorded as other revenue in the Operating revenues, gains and other support section of the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets for the y ears ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. In addition to the distribution of relief funds, the CARES Act also included electable payroll tax credits and deferrals. Cincinnati Children's elected to de lay payment of the employer portion of the Social Security payroll taxes on wages paid from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020 in the amount of $45,656. Half of the total deferred amount is required to be paid by December 31, 2021 and the remaining portion is due by December 31, 2022. At June 30, 2021, deferred payroll taxes of $22,828 are included in Other Long-Term Liabilities, and $22, 828 are included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At Ju ne 30, 2020, deferred payr oll taxes totaled $17,013 in Other Long-Term Liabilities. A payroll tax credit was also available under the CA RES Act for employers that continued to pay their employees while experiencing significant declines in operations caused by government orders or mandates associated with the response to the COVID- 19 pandemic. The available credit was determined by the amount of eligible wages and healthcare be nefits paid to non-working employees. Cincinnati Children's recognized total credits $10,566 in fiscal y ear 2020, which is reflected as a reduction in the respective Salaries and Employee benefits expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. No such cred its were recognized in fiscal year 2021. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 17 (2) Liquidity and Availability - Financial assets available for genera l expenditure within one year of th e balance sheet date consist of the following: 2021 2020 Amounts available for general ex penditure Cash and cash equivalents $ 274,863 $ 274,854 Marketable securities 1,352,918 1,028,382 Patient 2,275,641 1,855,227 Less: Board-designated - available for general expenditure $2,175,641 $1,855,227 Cincinnati Children's has cash and cash equivalents, mark etable securities (more fully described in Note 4), patient receivables and certain other receivables which ar e liquid and available for general expenditure within one year in the normal course of operations. Accordi ngly, these assets have been included in the quantitative information above. During fiscal 2021, the Board of Trustees designated $100,000 from net assets without donor restrictions to be used to support Ci ncinnati Children's community pillar of the Pursuing Our Potential Together strategic plan. Cincinnati Children's has ot her assets limited to use for professional liability, self- insurance health care and debt service, as well as pe rpetual endowments with donor restrictions. These assets limited to use, which are more fully described in Not es 4 and 6, are not availabl e for general expenditure within the next year and are not reflected in the amounts above. Cincinnati Children's has $192,165 in outstanding obliga tions for which liquid funds must be available for payment in the event of a failed remarketing. Cinci nnati Children's maintains certain balances in cash and investments and has access to a $100,000 line of cr edit, as discussed in more detail in Note 9. Additionally, Cincinnati Children's is required to main tain certain liquidity ratios as outlined in bond covenants. As of June 30, 2021 and 20 20, Cincinnati Children's was in complia nce with all such covenants. Cincinnati Children's forecasts its future cash flows and monitors liquidity on an ongoing basis. (3) Reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash - The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash e quivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that su m to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $274,863 $274,854 Restricted cash included in other long-term assets 8,039 84,393 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $282,902 $359,247 Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 18 (4) Fair Value Measurements - Cincinnati Children's accounts for its assets and liab ilities under ASC 820 \"Fair Value Measurements.\" As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and re lated disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted Prices (unadjusted) in active market s for identical assets or liab ilities that are accessible at the measurement date for assets and liabilities. The fair va lue hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for identical or similar a ssets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are a few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or am ong market makers, or in which little information is released publicly and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3: Unobservable inputs, devel oped using Cincinnati Children's estim ates and assumptions, which reflect those that the market participants would use. Such input s are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. Determining where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy depends on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. In determining fair value, Cincinnati Children's utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value.

Furthermore, although manage ment believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participan ts, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain fina ncial instruments could result in different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The carrying amount and fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. Cincinnati Children's uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of common stock and mutual funds; such items are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 21 Cincinnati Children's primarily bases fair value for i nvestments in fixed income securities, including U.S. government securities, municipal bonds and corporate ob ligations on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate). Consideration is also given to the counterparty credit ra ting. Such items are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Cincinnati Children's interest rate swap agreement (N ote 14) is a derivative instrument valued using the income approach, which uses market inputs to discount future cash flows to a sing le present amount based on market expectations. Cincinnati Children's investment in High Yield Corporat e Obligations is an investment in a limited liability company whose investment objective is to achieve supe rior fixed income returns on invested funds through exposure to higher quality, less volatile, high yield debt securities. As set forth in the LLC agreement, the LLC will dissolve on March 29, 2040, but may dissolve ear lier under certain conditions . Any Investing Member may elect to withdraw, in whole or in part from the LLC on the last business day of any month or at such other date, as determined by the manager. The High Yield Cor porate Obligations is measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Cincinnati Children's investment in Full Discretion Fi xed Income is an investment in a limited liability company whose investment objective is to invest in ma rketable and non-marketable securities with issue and industry diversification. As set fo rth in the LLC agreement, the LLC will dissolve on May 22, 2047, but may dissolve earlier under certain conditions. Any Investing Me mber may elect to withdraw, in whole or in part from the LLC if the Member notifies of intent to withdraw sixty calendar days in advance. The Full Discretion Fixed Income is measured at fair value using th e net asset value per share practical expedient. The guaranteed insurance contract is recorded based on discounted cash fl ows, which is an approximation of fair value, and is classified as Level 3 based on time restrictions for redemption. Activity and transfers into and out of Level 3 a nd the reasons for those transfers are as follows: 2021 Guaranteed Insurance Contracts Purchases $132 Issues - 2020 Guaranteed Insurance Contracts Purchases $257 Issues - Cincinnati Children's policy is to recognize transfers in a nd out as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transf er. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no material transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3. (5) Losses on the Provision of Uncompensated Care - In accordance with its mission and pur pose, Cincinnati Children's maintain s a policy of providing medically necessary services to pediatric patients within its primary service area regardless of ability to pay. This primary service area has been defined to incl ude the four counties in Ohio, three counties in Kentucky and one county in Indiana that geographically surround Cincinnati. Under certain circumstances, Cincinnati Children's accepts patients from outside the primar y service area regardless of their ab ility to pay. Ci ncinnati Children's defines uncompensated care as services rendered to patient s whose families' annual income or net worth falls Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 22 below certain minimum standards. As such, losses absorbed by Cincinna ti Children's in rendering services to patients who are covered under governmental programs which are designed to aid low-income families (primarily the Medicaid program) are considered uncompensated care. The following information summari zes uncompensated care provided duri ng the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020: CHARGES 2021 2020 Charges under Medicaid and other entitleme nt programs $1,982,947 $1,877,045 Charity care not eligible for Medicaid assistance, at established charges 24,580 29,606 Other uncollectible self-pay, at established charges 19,442 27,404 and other uncollectible self-pay charges $2,026,969 $1,934,055 COSTS/LOSSES Estimated costs to provide uncompensated care $ 851,532 $ 817,078 Reimbursement from Medicaid programs (611,230) (493,257) Losses on the provision of uncompensated care (240,302) (323,821) Funds received from HCAP and tax levy 31,463 31,039 Losses on provision of uncompensated care net of HCAP and tax levy $(208,839) $(292,782) The 2021 and 2020 cost amounts reflected in the tables above are calculated using cost to charge ratios calculated from preliminary cost reports because the current year cost report is not yet available. Management does not believe the use of preliminary data would ha ve a material impact on the amounts calculated above. (6) Funds in Trust - Cincinnati Children's has certain funds, which are invested and held in trust for various specified purposes. Funds are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in net investment return in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations a nd Changes in Net Assets. The amounts of such funds, at carrying value, and the specified purposes for whic h such funds may be used, are set forth below: June 30, 2021 2020 Self-insurance Funds- Professional liability $ 159 $ 160 Employee health and workers' compensation 140 140 Bond interest and principle escrow funds 7,740 6,960 Endowment funds held in perpetual trus t 23,211 16,076 Bond proceeds held in trust for construction project - 77,133 $31,250 $100,469 Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands) 23 (7) Property and Equipment - Property and equipment cons ists of the following: June 30, 2021 2020 Land $ 42,158 $ 42,142 Land improvements 31,645 Buildings and building (1,314,050) Property and net $1,403,713 $1,310,805 (8) Professional Liability - Cincinnati Children's insurance program includes a self-i nsured retention for losses arising out of healthcare professional liability claims. The current self-insured retention for asserted claims is $10,000 ($25,000 in aggregate). Cincinnati Children's regularly purchases excess healthcare professional liability insurance on a claim made basis at varying levels. The actuarial present value of expected costs (includi ng incurred, but not reported claims) for the healthcare professional liability program of $22,184 and $20,939 for 2021 and 2020, respectively, has been accrued in the accompanying Consolidated Bala nce Sheets. Accrued healthcare pr ofessional liability losses have been discounted at a rate of 4% at June 30, 2021 and 2020. The costs of Cincinnati Children's healthcare professional liability program, including premiums paid for excess re-insurance, legal fees, settlements, judgments, and other administrative costs are include d in Supplies, Drugs and Other in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cha nges in Net Assets. Accrued losses funding levels are actuarially determined based on ma nagement's estimation of potentia l outstanding loss liabilities, payout patterns, and various other assumptions, and then adjusted to reflect its best estimate of the present value of expected costs for the healthcare pr ofessional liability claims. Healthcar e professional liability expense was $5,359 and $12,309 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(10) Employee Benefit Plans - Cincinnati Children's maintains non-contributory retirem ent plans covering substantially all employees. Among these plans is a defined benefit plan where bene fits are based on a formula which reflects years of service and salary levels. Cincinnati Children's funding policy for its defined benefit plan meets the funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Cincinnati Children's investment strategy with respect to pension assets is designe d to achieve a moderate level of overall portfolio risk in keeping with desired risk objective, which is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition. Cincinnati Children's adopted an Investment Policy that adjusts alloca tions between return-seeking assets and liability-hedging assets based on the funded status of the Plan and prevaili ng yields. As the funded ratio improves, allocations to liability-hedging assets increase accordingly. Cincinnati Children's seeks to maintain diversified portf olios and has adopted allocation targets within the return-seeking and liability hedging portfolios as follows: Return-Seekin g Allocation: Min - Tar get -Max Global 60% 70% t 50% - - 100% STRIPS (Long Duration Treasury In struments) 0% - 25% - 50% In order to maintain the portfolio's actual asset alloca tion in line with the target allocations specified above, rebalancing will occur periodically. As of June 30, 2021, Cincinnati Child ren's has made $126,400 in funding commitments in eleven investment partnerships of which $81,340 has been funde d. Additionally, Cincinnati Children's has made $72,500 in funding commitments in nine real estate investment partnerships of which $67,620 has been funded. It is anticipated that these co mmitments will be funded from liquid investments of the plan.

The fair value for investments in fixed income securities, including U. S. government securities and corporate obligations, is based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the term s of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) a nd considers the counterparty credit rating. Such items are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Investments in part nerships - U.S. equities, real estate, and bonds - are valued using the net asset value reported by the manage rs of the funds and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and sale transactions. The investments in investment partnerships generally are associated with liquidation restrictions that may range from 91 days to the life of the fund (up to fifteen years) and may require redemption penalties. Commingled investment funds are private funds for institutional investors valued at net asset value. The commingl ed funds primarily invest in activel y traded equity mutual funds, bond mutual funds, and US Treasury STRIPS with daily liquidity and no lockup period. There were no transfers between levels in fiscal year 2021 or fiscal year 2020. The following table reflects the wei ghted average assumptions utilized to determine benefit obligations: 2021 2020 Discount rate used to determine actuarial present value of the projected benefit obli gation 3.27% 3.33% Assumed rate of increase in com levels 3.50% 3.50% Long-term rate of return 5.50% 5.50% 1 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedien t have not been categorized in the fair valu e hierarchy.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial statements, we considered Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the pur pose of expressing our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control. Accordingly, we do not ex press an opinion on the ef fectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to preven t, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a comb ination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prev ented, or detected and corr ected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficien cies, in internal control that is le ss severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limite d purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, duri ng our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material w eaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Cincinnati Children's consolidated financial statements are free from material mi sstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the sc ope of our testing of intern al control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opini on on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Cincinnati Children's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Cincinnati Children's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; an d the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and th e Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonab le assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a di rect and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test ba sis, evidence about Cincinnati Children's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Cincinnati Children's compliance. Opinion on Each Ma jor Federal Program In our opinion, Cincinnati Children's complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a dir ect and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2021.

Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control over compliance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncomplia nce with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and co rrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combinatio n of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is le ss severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over complianc e was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identif y all deficiencies in intern al control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficien cies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be materi al weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. The purpose of this report on internal control over comp liance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of th at testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
