They can also contain perfume fragrances or essential oils that mask the odour of sweat in case the bacteria start growing again. Unfortunately, many deodorants do not produce a long-lasting effect and have to be reapplied several times a day. Antiperspirants significantly reduce perspiration or even stop it: no sweat - no body odour because the bacteria have nowhere to thrive. Antiperspirants are more effective than regular deodorants, but they are not perfect. The problem is that constant use of antiperspirants involves considerable health risks. Antiperspirants plug sweat gland ducts or make them constrict which may cause sweat gland inflammation (hidradenitis). Besides, most antiperspirants contain aluminium compounds such as aluminium chloride, aluminium chlorohydrate, and aluminium-zirconium compounds. Although they are not toxic at low doses, the may cause allergic reactions. Besides, mass market deodorants and antiperspirants may contain potentially harmful ingredients such as phthalates and parabens which makes them unsuitable for consumers who care for their health and prefer to use organic personal care products. Unlike regular deodorants and antiperspirants, Crystal body deodorants do not contain any artificial additives. They do not reduce or stop perspiration and thus do not disturb thermoregulation which makes them perfect even for very hot weather. Crystal deodorants are formulated with potassium alum (potassium aluminium sulfate), a natural mineral salt that has astringent, styptic and antiseptic properties. Potassium alum eliminates the bacteria responsible for body odour and inhibits their growth. Deodorant crystals (also known as deodorant stones or deodorant rocks) create a thin protective film on the surface of your skin that does not prevent your skin from breathing and does not block perspiration. This means that natural deodorants are highly unlikely to cause irritation or inflammation. Crystal mineral salt deodorants are free of aluminium chlorohydrate, aluminium zirconium, phthalates and parabens. They are formulated with only natural ingredients and are completely safe for human health and the environment. Crystal deodorants are not tested on animals. They also help to save money because a deodorant crystal can last up to a year! Crystal body deodorants are an excellent choice for those who are not satisfied with the effect of regular deodorants and antiperspirants and for those who are allergic to ingredients contained in mass market deodorants.
