Learning about chiropractic care has helped me eat better. Also, since I began getting adjusted and receiving care in this office, I have learned to treat my bones better too. I would like to tell others that chiropractic actually helps and it almost changes your life. Chiropractic care is awesome! -Noah J. Thank you Roan Family Chiropractic for honoring me with the title of 'Patient of the Month' and giving me a soapbox to tell others about my experience with chiropractic care...and how great I think you all are! (You really should hand out a crown and sash each month, I'd wear mine with pride!) As for some history, my husband and I have been under chiropractic care for over 19 years now. In that time, we have lived in many areas and therefore have been treated by several chiropractors. We have really only seen medical doctors for yearly check-ups and I attribute chiropractic, alongside healthy diet and exercise, with maintaining our good health throughout these years. Looking back, I also see how chiropractic care has helped in many other areas of my life. It opened my eyes to a more holistic approach to wellness and just a better way of living in general. I know I would have never considered natural childbirth nor question every single vaccine that my child was faced with. We started our children on regular adjustments days after their birth and they have always been the healthiest ones compared to friends' children who don't get adjusted. I am so incredibly thankful that I have not had to deal with ear infections, stomach problems, or things like sleeping issues. I'm convinced chiropractic has played a huge part in keeping them healthy and I know it has helped all of us stave off numerous colds and infections. We moved to Easton 4 months ago and one of the first things on my 'to-do' list was to find a chiropractor. I was so thankful to find a chiropractic 'home' on my very first visit to Roan Family Chiropractic. Abby welcomed me with the brightest sincere smile and I knew immediately it was going to be a good experience. I met with Dr. Andrea and Dr. Todd, who were not only professional, but both very personable and friendly and I knew then that I was in good hands. We went through the initial consultation and x-rays and Dr. Todd took on the difficult task of my continued care. I'm not the easiest patient as I have quite a difficult-to-adjust neck and I knew that if he could adjust me comfortably, I found the right place. He has worked with me regularly since I first arrived and I have to say, with great joy, that his adjustments are definitely the best I have received in my 19 years of chiropractic care. He doesn't give up when others have. I leave Roan feeling like a million bucks! Thanks so much for providing a cozy place to come and continue my family's journey in wellness. With many thanks and best wishes for a healthy, happy, and prosperous new year, Janis Enciso ~ and family! * A special thank you to Abby for keeping a sharp eye on my girls during my appointments, and for your incredible patience with them!! Chiropractic care has made a very positive difference in the life of our family. Dave and I began Chiropractic before we got married, when we realized we both had a lot of unresolved chronic back and neck pain. We both immediately experienced pain relief from our very first adjustments, and continue to feel great today as a result of Chiropractic. I (Marina) was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder, 16 years ago. Chiropractic has been the major factor in getting relief from my chronic pain. Chiropractic allows me to function normally and exercise regularly, and I am very thankful for that. I don't know where I would be without my regular adjustments. When our children were born, we knew immediately that we would have them adjusted from the very beginning of their lives. Dave and I both wish that we had the benefit of Chiropractic care when we were young, because we believe that it is the best way to become and stay healthy. Our kids love their adjustments and can't wait to come to their Chiropractic appointments! We would like to tell people who have not tried Chiropractic that it has been wonderful for our whole family. We believe that we are significantly healthier and stronger as a result of our Chiropractic care and would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel better and be healthier. David, Marina, Lexi, Asher and Lilla Hatch "}
