Call to Order Som Saha, Chair of the Health Evidence Review Commission ( HERC) , called the meeting to order . Role was called. Approval of Minutes MOTION: To approve the minutes of the June 12, 2014 meeting as presented. CARRI ES 10- 0. Director's Report Darren Coffman confirmed there will be an interim modifications Prioritized List published October 1, 2014. The new biennial list will be published January 1, 2015. Going forward, we will produce lists each January and October 1st. The implementation of the next biennial list will be HERC Minutes 8/14/2014 1 on either Oct ober 1, 2015 or January 1, 2016, depending on CMS's final decision on the implementation of ICD -10. Coffman reported that he and Saha held conversations with two potential osteopathic physician candidates for th e DO HERC vacancy and there has been a strong candidate for the consumer representative who has indicated interest in that vacancy as well . The Governor's Office may hold off making appointments until October for a November Senate confirmation. Value- based Benefits Subcommittee (VbBS) Report Meeting materials handout Treatments for Hepatitis C Saha announced that the Commission is tabling the discussion of this topi c after hearing the recommendation that came out of the VbBS's meeting that morning, along with input from CCOs and legislators and new reports/ guidelines that will need to be reviewed. Miscellaneous recommended changes to the Prioritized List Ariel Smits, Cat Livingston and Kevin Olson, MD, VbBS Chair, each helped to summarize a number of topics discussed at recent meetings . Smits reported the recommendations from the May 8, 2014 VbBS meeting not reported at the June HERC meeting: May 8th recommendations for interim changes, effective 10/1/14 include: Add a surgical code to the colon cancer line Add a surgical code to the vascular insufficiency of intestines line Combine open and closed hip fracture diagnoses on the hip fract ure line Add transurethral prostatic implants for treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy Remove multiple surgical codes from the covered sleep apnea line Revise the rehabilitation guideline to reflect criteria for rehabilitation services rather than lim its based on the number of visits Revise the sleep apnea guideline to further define daytime sleepiness and to specify that tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy surgical codes on that line are for treatment of children only Add a new diagnostic guideline specifying that computer -aided mammography for both screening and diagnostic purposes is not a covered service August 14 th recommendations for interim changes, effective 10/1/14 include: Remove certain nerve block procedure codes from the Prioritized List and advise DMAP to place these codes in the A ncillary File Add diagnosis codes for diabetic retinopathy to the diabetic retinopathy line Add ICD-10 diagnosis codes for certain types of diabetes to the appropriate diabetes lines Delete diagnosis codes for chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation from the migraine headache line Add a new coding specification to the tension headache line specifying that chiropractic and osteopathic manipulation are on this line only for pairing with cervicogenic headache. HERC Minutes 8/14/2014 2 Add codes for c hemodenervation of the anal sphincter to the uncovered chronic anal fissure line Delete codes for chemodenervation of extraocular muscles from the covered amblyopia line; those codes will remain on two covered strabismus lines Modify t he nerve block guideline to include the CPT codes for certain procedures and remake it into an ancillary guideline Add a new guideline which specifies that removal of tympanostomy tubes is a covered service Modify t he spinal disorders guideline to require objective evidence of neurologic injury or radiculopathy Modify t he rehabilitation guideline to limit the total number of therapy visits for all conditions to 30 per year, except for certain neurological conditions or when in an inpatient rehabilitation facilit y. Modify t he ly mphedema guideline to specify that compression dressings/garments are covered for treatment of lymphedema even in the absence of complications. Delete the Synagis guideline for RSV prophylaxis Add several new coding specifications regarding use of botulinum toxin; delete the guideline note regarding botulinum toxin use for bladder indications August 14 th recommendations for interim changes, effective 10/1/14 include: Add several surgical codes for sex reassignment surgery to the gender dysphoria line along with new guideline on when hormone therapy and surgical treatment is appropriate May 8 th recommendations for the 2016 biennial list include: M ove the diagnostic code for unspecified myopathy from the covered dysfunction lines to the uncovered fibromyalgia line. Add the diagnostic code for chronic fatigue syndrome to the new fibromyalgia line and retitle it Remove the diagnosis codes for injuries to the major blood vessels of the neck from one covered line to a more appropriate covered line Create a new lymphedema line and prioritize it in the covered region of the Prioritized List Create a new line for miscellaneous conditions requiring no treatment and prioritize it to the last line on the Prioritized List Merge the somatization and factitious disorder lines; prioritize into the non -covered region of the Prioritized List Combine the two hyperbaric oxygen lines (merge line 373 into line 336) Other recommendations were developed related to the prioritization of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but those will be presented for discussion at the November meeting along with the coverage guidance that they were based on. VbBS Chair Kevin Olson and staff then asked for clarification about incorporating coverage guidances into the List, specifically what to do with weak recommendations for and against . Saha clarified that VbBS has other considerations to weigh, including cost, public input, etc. They should use the entire document, including the GRADE -informed framework, to make an appropriate recom mendation for placement on the Prioritized List of Health Services. HERC Minutes 8/14/2014 3 MOTION: To accept the VbBS recommendations on changes to upcoming Prioritized Lists as stated. See the VbBS minutes of 5/8 /14, 8/8/14 and 8/14/14 for a full description. Carries: 10 -0. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Meeting Materials page 143- 264 Dr. Cat Livingston reviewed the background on the Commission's evaluation of the evidence of ABA for ASD, which began in August of 2013. Oregon Senate Bill 365 (2013) requirments . Requires state -regulated commercial health plans to approve and manage autism treatment, including ABA therapy and any other medical or mental health services identified in an individualized treatment plan. o Law applies to patients who seek care before age nine, minimum coverage of up to 25 hours of ABA per week , continuing as long as medically necessary. o Health plans that provide coverage to OEBB and PEBB must begin coverage in 2015 o Other health plans are required to begin coverage in 2016. The bill required HERC to evaluate the evidence for ABA and make a coverage decision for OHP. EbGS reviewed the evidence and adopted summary conclusions based on the modifi ed GRADE methodology used in the coverage guidance development process. Expert input and public comment was so licited and reviewed. In addition to specific comments, a total of 336 unduplicated citations were provided by public commenters. Each citation was evaluated to determine study design or article type and population characteristics (number and ages of included individuals), the abstract was retrieved and a link to the article provided when available. Given that the focus of most of the public commen t pertained to requesting that ABA be recommended for coverage in individuals over age 12, a detailed review of citations was limited to those studies. A random sample of 10% of single -subject research design ( SSRD) study types were reviewed in additional detail. In addition, all systematic reviews and meta - analyses of SSRDs were reviewed in more detail. EbGS met April 24, 2014, having reviewed the evidence, public written comment, in- person public comment and expert input and approved a modified evaluation of the evidence to send to VbBS. On further review of what is allowed under the M ental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, staff suggested and VbBS agreed to modify the language to be more descriptive of the studies and not include specific hour or duration limits of the treatment . Proposed scoring would place treatment of autism at approximately line 199, up from the current prioritization of 313. Coffman added that the implementation date, as determined by OHA leadership, will be January 1, 2015. This coincides with a new CCO contract/rate period and with the date when providers can be licensed/ certified to provide this care. HERC Minutes 8/14/2014 4 In June 2014, VbBS approved a new guideline on treatment of autistic spectrum disorder with applied behavioral analysis. Many of the studies and discussion centered around self - injurious behavior. There was some concern expressed that the guideline being recommended only impacted patients diagnosed with autism and did not include treatment for non-autistic patients with sel f-injurious behaviors. This condition responds in the same way to ABA as does a person with an ASD diagnosis. Public Comment Christie & Eric Riehl, as a parent s of a child with autism and self -injurious behavior , offered their perspective and advocated to allow coverage of ABA for patients outside of an ASD diagnosis. She urged the commission to include codes for inpatient treatment and to include other comorbid conditions. Tobi Rates , Executive Director of the Autism Society of Oregon and parent of two children on the autism spectrum who receive OHP services, expressed her gratitude to the Commission for taking on this complex issue, for the recommendations presented today and announcing a clear implantation date. She expressed concern with conclusion that the evidence for ABA for children 13 years and older is inconclusive. She said her advocacy group would continue to examine this issue. Maria Wynne Gilmour, Wynne Solution, an ABA provider and board certified behavior analyst of 15 years from Portland, added some statistics regarding self -injurious behavior. In the last 30 days, she has received 18 referrals for this condition of which 8 were children over 12 or adults. Gibson asked if ABA for self -injurious behavior, in the absence of an ASD diagnosis, is effective. Saha stated that the subcommittee determined it is effective. Chan, the subcommittee chair, suggested the evidence summary be reframed for clarity. Saha agreed, the subcommittee may look at editing their work but that would not preclude a vote today. Audience member Christie Riehl, asked additional implementation questions about coding problem behavior s vs. prim ary diagnosis, citing the guideline that is being replaced. Livingston assured all that ABA treatment will need prior authorization and will be considered by a medical reviewer. MOTION: To accept the VbBS recommendations to add codes and a guideline to the Prioritized List based on the EbGS evidence evaluation on applied behavior analysis for autism spectrum disorder and approve the staff recommendation to add ABA to Line 442 of the 1/1/15 list including self -injurious behavior (see Attachment A) . CARRIES: 10 -0. Cross -Sex Hormone Therapy & Sex Reassignment Surgery for Gender Dysphoria Meeting Materials pages 265- 269 Dr. Ariel Smits explained, t he January 1, 2015 Prioritized List includes gender dysphoria as a new, covered line (413) . HERC Minutes 8/14/2014 5 Currently, the only treatments approved for inclusion on that line are office visits, psychotherapy and puberty suppression medication for transgender and gender - questioning youth. Other treatments include cross -sex hormone therapy and sex reassignment (gender reassignment) surgery. o Additional evidence was reviewed about the efficacy of treatment, particularly in reducing suicide attempts, IV drug abuse, and other high -risk behavior . o Treatment significantly reduces depression and anxiety in patients. o The total cost to OHP of adding additional treatments is expected to be minimal. o Evidence support s adding cross -sex hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery , excluding the more cosmetic -focused procedures (breast augmentation, facial bone reconstruction). o Proposed scoring would place treatment of autism at approximately line 312, up from the current prioritization of 413. At the VbBS meeting earlier in the day, there was considerable discussion about the lack of an age restriction for surgical procedures. Smits confirmed that the Oregon age of consent for surgical procedures is age 15. Dr. Olson explained that these types of procedures should not be singled out for restriction until age 18 or even higher, as many other procedures which have life- long impact can be consented to at age 15. Tyack explained his position by saying there are so many things a 15- year-old cannot do. They cannot drive, serve in the armed forces, vote, ing est alcohol, smoke, etc. In general, he supports the procedure and feels sympathy for people who need the surgery but cannot get passed the issue of age of medical consent. Ahmann added his agreement and concern. Saha discussed whether anyone under the age of 18 should be able to consent to any surgery and stated that is a question for lawmakers in Oregon. He thought it would be a dangerous precedent to single out an exception for this one surgery. Williams discussed her understanding is that surgery it self comes near end of a long treatment plan. No one rushes into this irreversible surgery lightly or without preparation. Smits added the evidence shows there is a very low rate of regret recorded. Saha believes the stipulations in the guideline preclude one making a rash decision. Public Comment Danielle Askini, policy director for Basic Rights Oregon , asser ted that this invasive, life - altering treatment is only given as part of a lengthy continuum of care. Youth are required to have extensive evaluations by qualified mental health professionals and that the year of hormone therapy required in the guideline acts as another safeguard against rash decisions by youth. Jenn Burleton , Executive Director of TransA ctive, agreed with Ms. Askini , adding details about the lengthy path to surgery: assessments, reassessment, evaluation, referral and many other steps throughout the grow th cycle . Saha asked if families often support youths with gender dysphoria. Burleton responded affirmatively. Moreover, those living outside the home have advocacy and support as well. HERC Minutes 8/14/2014 6 Ahmann wanted to know how many surgeries are completed per year in Oregon. Burleton and Askini stated there are two physicians in Oregon who perform gender -confirming surgeries and estimated a very small percentage would undergo genital reconstruction. Burleton added, with access to puberty suppressing drugs, many procedures will become unnecessary, as the undesired sex characteristics will never fully develop. Smits added many individuals do well with certain medications and counseling and never pursue surgical interventions. She added, among California government employees, a study showed that 42 surgeries were perfor med over a 6.5- year period. Gibson commented that while he shares the concerns about age, we cannot rewrite the state statute about age of medical consent though the HERC process. MOTION: To approve the line rescoring, updated treatment description, and the addition of cross -sex hormone therapy and various surgical procedures to the gender dysphoria line, and the new guideline as recommended by VbBS (see Attachment B) . CARRIES 8 -2 (Opposed:Tyack, Abstained: Ahmann). Retreat Planning Coffman mentioned the HERC retreat is scheduled for O ctober 30, 2014 at a location TBD. Some commissioners expressed a wish to have the retreat be a closed meeting, feeling that would foster more open conversation. Coffman explained what constituted a public meeting; in part, a public body with quorum discussing or deliberating towards a decision. Saha advocated for a public meeting, commenting that a core HERC principle is transparency . Further, he argued, limiting the discussion to meet the restrictions of a closed meeting would effectively limit the Commission's ability for meaningfully discussion, necessitating another public meeting to rehash topics to allow for public deliberations. All agreed using a facilitator with familiarity with the HERC process and products makes sense. Staff suggested the possibility of a compromise, with half of the meeting closed, then opened as a public meeting to allow deliberation. Members would like participation in discussion limited to staff, commissioners, subcommittee members and advisory panel members. They clearly expressed their desire to hear no public comment that day. Staff will review public meeting law s to see what is possible. Public Comment There was no other public comment at this time. Adjournment Meeting was adjourned at 3:30 pm. Next s cheduled regular meeting - November 13, 2014, Meridian Park Room 117 B&C . HERC Minutes 8/14/2014 7 ATTACHMENT A Changes to Prioritized List Involving Applied Behavior Analysis Add codes as follows to Line 313 and 442 of 1/1/15 Prioritized List : Code Description Action 0359T Behavior identification assessment Add to 313 & 442 Follows 0359T 0360T 16- 45 min 0361T each additional 30 min Observational behavioral follow -up assessment Add to 313 & 442 Follows 0359T 0362T 16- 45 min 0363T each additional 30 min Exposure behavioral follow -up assessment Add to 313 & 442 0364T first 30 min 0365T each additional 30 min Adaptive behavior treatment by protocol Add to 313 & 442 0366T first 30 min 0367T each additional 30 min Group adaptive behavior treatment by protocol Add to 313 & 442 0368T first 30 min 0369T each additional 30 min Adaptive behavior treatment with protocol modification Add to 313 & 442 0370T Family adaptive behavior treatment guidance Add to 313 & 442 0373T first 60 minutes of technicians' time, 0374T each additional 30 minutes of technicians' time Exposure adaptive behavior treatment with protocol modification Add to 313 & 442 Revise Guideline Note 75 as follows effective 1/1/15: GUIDELINE NOTE 75 , APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS FOR AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER Line 313 There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of treatment (e.g., Applied Behavioral Analysis) for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, effective treatments may be available for co -morbid conditions such as mood disorders. When treating co- morbid conditions, that condition, not an ASD diagnosis, should be the primary diagnosis for billing purposes. The treatment of co- morbid mental health conditions should be consistent with the treatment methods, frequency, and duration normally applied to those diagnoses. Treatment of neurologic dysfunctions that may be seen in individuals with an ASD diagnosis are prioritized according to the four dysfunction lines found on the Prioritized List (Lines 78, 318, 375 and 407). Treatment for associated behaviors, such as agitation, that do not meet the criteria for co -morbid mental health diagnoses should be limited in frequency to a maximum of 8 hours of behavioral health service per month, subject to utilization management review by the mental health organization (MHO) or other relevant payer. Appli ed behavior analysis (ABA), including early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), represented by CPT codes 0359T -0374T, is included on line 313 for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. HERC Minutes 8/14/2014, Attachment A A-1 ATTACHMENT A Changes to Prioritized List Involving Applied Behavior Analysis GUIDELINE NOTE 75, APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS FOR AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (Cont'd) ABA services are provided in addition to any rehabilitative services (e.g. physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy) included in guideline note 6, REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES that are indicated for other acute qualifying conditions. Individuals ages 1 -12 Specifically, EIBI (for example, UCLA/Lovaas or Early Start Denver Model), is included on this line. For a child initiating EIBI therapy, EIBI is included for up to six months. Ongoing coverage is based on demonstrated progress towards meaningful predefined objectives (objectives should be achieved as a result of the EIBI, over and beyond gains that would be expected to arise from maturation alone) using a standardized, multimodal assessment, no more frequen tly than every six months. Examples of such assessments include Vineland, IQ tests (Mullen, WPPSI, WISC -R), language measures, behavior checklists (CBCL, ABC), and autistic symptoms measures (SRS). The evidence does not lead to a direct determination of optimal intensity. Studies of EIBI ranged from 15- 40 hours per week. Through Oregon's Senate Bill 365, other payers are mandated to cover a minimum of 25 hours per week of ABA. There is no evidence that increasing intensity of therapy yields improves out comes. Studies for these interventions had a duration from less than one year up to 3 years. If EIBI is not indicated, has been completed, or there is not sufficient progress toward multidimensional goals, then less intensive ABA -based interventions (such as parent training, play/interaction based interventions, and joint attention interventions) are included on this line to address core symptoms of autism and/or specific problem areas. Initial coverage is provided for six months. Ongoing coverage is based on demonstrated progress towards meaningful predefined objectives, with demonstration of medical appropriateness and/or emergence of new problem behaviors. Effective interventions from the research literature had lower intensity than EIBI, usually a few hours per week to a maximum of 16 hours per week, divided into daily, twice- daily or weekly sessions, over a period of several months. Parent/caregiver involvement and training is recommended as a component of treatment. Individuals ages 13 and older Intensive ABA is not included on this line. Targeted ABA -based behavioral interventions to address problem behaviors, are included on this line. The quality of evidence is insufficient to support these HERC Minutes 8/14/2014, Attachment A A-2 ATTACHMENT A Changes to Prioritized List Involving Applied Behavior Analysis GUIDELINE NOTE 75, APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS FOR AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (Cont'd) interventions in this population. However, due to strong caregiver values and preferences and the potential for avoiding suffering and expense in dealing with unmanageable behaviors, targeted interventions may be reasonable. Behaviors eligible for coverage include those which place the member at risk for harm or create significant daily issues related to care, education, or other important functions. Ongoing coverage is based on demonstrated progress towards meaningful predefined objectives, with demonstration of medical appropriateness and/or emergence of new problem behaviors. Very low quality evidence is available to illustrate needed intensity and duration of intervention. In the single- subject research design literature, frequency and duration of interventions were highly variable, with session duration ranging from 30 seconds to 3 hours, number of sessions ranging from a total of three to 8 times a day, and duration ranging from 1 to 20 weeks. These interventions w ere often conducted in inpatient or residential settings and studies often included patients with intellectual disabilities, some of which were not diagnosed with autism. Parent/caregiver involvement and training is encouraged. Add the following guidel ine note to the 1/1/15 Prioritized List: GUIDELINE NOTE 126 , APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS (ABA) INTERVENTIONS FOR SELF -INJURIOUS BEHAVIOR Line 442 Targeted ABA -based interventions towards self -injurious problem behaviors are included on this line when meeting criteria as defined in guideline note 75 APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS FOR AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER.

This therapy should be initiated at the first physical changes of puberty, confirmed by pubertal levels of estradiol or testosterone, but no earlier than Tanner stages 2- 3. Prior to initiation of puberty suppression therapy, adolescents must fulfill eligibility and readiness criteria, and must have a comprehensive mental health evaluation. Ongoing psychological care is strongly encouraged for continued puberty suppression therapy. Cross -sex hormone therapy is included on this line for treatment of adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria who meet appropriate eligibility and readiness criteria. To qualify for cross -sex hormone therapy, the patient must: 1) have persistent, well -documented gender dysphoria 2) have the capacity to make a fully informed decision and to give consent for treatment 3) have any significant medical or mental health concerns reasonably well controlled 4) have a thorough psychosocial assessment by a qualified mental health professional with experience in working with patients with gender dysphoria Sex reassignment surgery is included for patients who are sufficiently physically fit and meet eligibility criteria. To qualify for surgery, the patient must: 1) have persistent, well documented gender dysphoria 2) have completed twelve months of continuous hormone therapy as appropriate to the member's gender goals unless hormones are not clinically indicated for the individual 3) have completed twelve months of living in a gender role that is congruent with their gender identity unless a medical and a mental health professional both deter mine that this requirement is not safe for the patient 4) have the capacity to make a fully informed decision and to give consent for treatment 5) have any significant medical or mental health concerns reasonably well controlled HERC Minutes 8/14/2014, Attachment B B-1 ATTACHMENT B Changes to Prioritized List Involving Treatments for Gender Dysphoria GUIDELINE 127, GENDER DYSPHORIA (Cont'd) 6) have two referrals from qualified mental health professionals with experience in working with patients with gender dysphoria who have independently assessed the patient.

Minutes from the June 12, 2014 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved. (Passed 7-0, Pollack absent ) ACTION: HERC staff will post the approved minutes on the website as soon as possible. Topic: Hepatitis C Treatments Discussion: Livingston presented an issue summary. She briefly reviewed the MED report and the natural history of hepatitis C. She discussed that new trials are being released every week, and that a Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) report is expected in early 2015. She reviewed the staff recommendation to place treatment for hepatitis C with newer low -value agents low on the Prioritized List with a guideline Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 2 referring to the Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee Prior Authorization Criteria , which was recently adopted for fee- for-service clients . It was discussed that the prior criteria would have led to an estimated one -year cost of $168 million if applied to all OHP clients not a part of the ACA expansion, and with the revised P&T criteria this would limit the expected cost to approximately one-quarter of that amount . Kent Benner, from the Oregon Clinic offered invited testimony. He is a hepatologist member of the external \"Community Advisory Panel\" who helped develop the criteria adopted by the P & T Committee for prior authorization. He declared no conflicts of interest. He stated that the prevalence of hepatitis C has not yet reached its peak. He also discussed the costs associated with liver decompensation and this should be considered in a cost -effectiveness analysis, mentioning studies that show a 8-15 fold reduction in endpoints if the virus can be cleared. Studi es have typically excluded patients whom are sick with decompensation. H e believes there is sufficient data to validate the effectiveness of these new drugs , and that they are game changers. Dr. Benner explained the rationale for treating the patients more urgently needing care represented in the latest P & T criteria , but said that this \"triaging\" raises major clinical and policy questions. Public Comment: Lauren Sant, Director of the Caring Ambassadors program. She acknowledged Caring Ambassadors gets unrestricted funding from every pharmaceutical company. She said that that moving drugs below the funding line is against the law. She discussed that current therapies are toxic, and that keeping telapravir and bocepravir as an o ption is criminal. She request ed public input into the process. S he said that she was co- chair of the \"Fair Pricing Coalition\" for many years and acknowledged the high price of these drugs. Steve Nemerow, who represented himself and declared no conflicts of interest. He discussed his personal experience with Sovaldi and how this therapy cured him and allowed him to work and be functional. He said the committee shouldn't be saving money, but rather should be saving lives. BJ Cavnor, E xecutive Director of One in Four Chronic Health. He acknowledged his organization receives unrestricted education Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 3 grants from the pharmaceutical industry,although they have not received funding from Gilead. He argued that th e cost of no t treating hepatitis C needs to be looked at, not just the cost of treating. He also addressed the need to treat individuals with HIV co-infection. He reports working on price reduction of drugs since 1997. Dr. Olson asked to clarify what options were available to the subcommittee. Livingston discussed options of placing these treatments above or below a line, with or without a guideline, or to remain silent. Dr. Benner also asked some clarifying questions and stated that some of the studies of these medications have looked at non- treatment na\u00efve patients. Additionally a question was asked about whether patients with decompensation will improve, and the answer was it is unknown. There is the hope that this will remove people from the transplant list but the data is not there yet. There is also the reality that relapse rates are likely higher than in the initial studies. Mark Gibson discussed concerns about potential different coverage between fee- for-service and CCOs if these treatments a prioritized below the funding line. The subcommittee also discussed issues about price and there being an absolute limit to what can be funded for OHP , also balanced with education, child protective services, and public safety. If money were to be redirected from social supports to health care, then a net health deficit would be created. There was a discussion about price differences between different countries. and how, because of the price set, and the profit being derived from this drug, this is creating very difficult decisions. The moral aspects of the pricing of this drug were discussed. There was discussion about endorsing P&T Committee criteria . The group discussed the challenge that if it does cost ~ $40 million dollars, then where is that money going to come from and what other budgets are being put at risk ? There was a request for the future to address high cost medications with some sort of standard or consistent guideline. There was a discussion about the suggested criteria regarding drug and alcohol use and abuse. They decided that 6 months of abstinence from alcohol misuse or hazardous drinking and substance use (or misuse of prescription medication) was appropriate. Tyack announced a potential conflict of interest that did not require recusal. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 4 There were concerns about currently available economic analyses not showing that this will save costs. There was a discussion that the cost in Oregon should be known, up front, as well as projected costs and savings down the road. It was suggested the legislature would need to find additional funding to work around 2% cap. Another proposal was to not offer the drug and then the effective price may drop, this has been seen in oncology drugs. After discussion, the subcommittee requested that MOTION: To recommend keeping medical treatments for Hepatitis C on lines 205 and 360 with a guideline note referencing the P & T committee criteria, and to have staff bring back revised wording reflecting today's discussion to the August 14, 2014 VbBS meeting for additional review. CARRIES 8 -0.

MOTION: To approve the consent agenda as presented. CARRIES 7- 0. Recommended Actions: 1) Add 40530 ( Resection of lip, more than 1/4, without reconst ruction) to line 292/279 CANCER OF SKIN, EXCLUDING MALIGNANT MELANOMA 2) Add 77418 ( Intensity modulated treatment delivery, single or multiple fields/arcs, via narrow spatially and temporally modulated beams, binary, dynamic MLC, per treatment session) and 77 421 (Stereoscopic X -ray guidance for localization of target volume for the delivery of radiation therapy ) to lines 252/242 CANCER OF OVARY and 459/439 CANCER OF GALLBLADDER AND OTHER BILIARY 3) Add 35606 ( Bypass graft, with other than carotid- line 440/419 TRANSIENT CEREBRAL ( Split-thickness f ace, scalp, eyelids, mouth, neck, ears, orbits, genitalia, hands, feet, and/or multiple digits; first 100 sq cm or less, or 1% of body area of infants and children) and 15121 ( each additional 100 sq cm, or each additional 1% of body area of infants and children, or part thereof) to line 448/427 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE USUALLY REQUIRING TREATMENT 6) Add 14040 ( Adjacent tissue transfer or rearrangement, forehead, cheeks, chin, mouth, neck, axillae, genitalia, hands and/or feet; defect 10 sq cm or less) to line 459/438 HYPOSPADIAS AND EPISPADIAS 7) Add 62311 therapeutic substance(s) ,including anesthetic, antispasmodic, opioid, steroid, other solution, not including neurolytic substances, including needle or catheter placement, includes contrast for localization when performed, epidural or subarachnoid; lumbar or sacral) to lines 78/75 NEUROLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION IN BREATHING, EATING, SWALLOWING, BOWEL, OR BLADDER CONTROL CAUSED BY CHRONIC CONDITIONS; ATTENTION TO OSTOMIES and 318/297 NEUROLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION IN POSTURE AND MOVEMENT CAUSED BY CHRONIC CONDITIO NS 8) Add 90670 (Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 13 valent ) to line 3 PREVENTIVE SERVICES, BIRTH TO 10 YEARS OF AGE and 4 PREVENTIVE SERVICES, OVER AGE OF 10 of the October 1, 2014 list and line 3 PREVENTION SERVICES WITH EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS of January 1, 2015 list a. Advise DMAP to remove 90670 from the Excluded List. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 4 Topic: Nerve blocks Discussion: Smits introduced the summary document regarding nerve blocks. The subcommittee felt that the return of these codes to the Ancillary List was the better of the two proposed staff recommendations. This will allow the nerve blocks to continue to be treated as anesthesia for the peri -operative uses. Additionally, HERC staff could not find previous discussion/rationale for moving these codes from Ancillary to the Prioritized List. The Subcommittee felt that this was likely a mistake and should be corrected. The guideline note is recommended to be changed to an Ancillary Guideline. MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7-0. Recommended Actions: 1) Remove all nerve block CPT codes (64400- 64450) from lines on the Prioritized List 2) DMAP was advices to place CPT codes (64400- 64450) on the Ancillary List 3) Make the current nerve block guideline into an Ancillary Guideline and modif y to add the CPT codes. See Appendix A for final approved wording . 4) Note: The meeting materials mistakenly listed the code range as 64400-64550 Topic: Diabetic retinopathy codes Discussion: Smits presented the staff summary for this topic. Allergan representatives informed staff that GN 116 needs to be considered for modification to allow pairing of intraocular steroids with the new FDA approved indication for limited use in diabetic retinopathy. Staff agreed to look into this possible GN change and bring back for further discussion at the November, 2014 VbBS meeting. MOTION: To recommend the code changes as presented. CARRIES 7- 0. Recommended Actions: 1) Add the 362.0x codes (diabetic retinopathy, mild/moderate/severe, with or without proliferative retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema) to line 106/100 DIABETIC AND OTHER RETINOPATHY a. Advise DMAP to remove the 362.0x codes from the Excluded List b. Note: there was a typographical error in the meeting materials. The correct ICD -9 code is 362.0x, not 367. 0x 2) Add all codes in the E10.3xx family ( Type 1 diabetes mellitus with ophthalmologic complications) to line 100 DIABETIC AND OTHER RETINOPATHY for the January 1, 2015 Prioritized List Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 5 3) Add all codes in the E08.3xx family (diabetes due to underlying condition with retinopathy), E09.3xx family (drug or chemical induced diabetes with retinopathy), E11.3xx family (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with ophthalmologic complications) , and E13.3xx family (other specified diabetes with retinopathy) to line 30 TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS for the January 1, 2015 Prioritized List 4) Staff will review possible changes to GN116 for the November, 2014 V bBS meeting Topic: Tympanostomy tube removal Discussion: Livingston reviewed the material in the packet for this topic. There was min imal discussion. MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7- 0. Recommended Actions: 1) Make no changes to the placement of tympanic membrane perforation diagnosis codes 2) Add a new guideline specifying that retained tympanostomy tube removal is a covered procedure even if the underlying diagnosis for placement of these tubes was a non- covered diagnosis. See Appendix B for guideline wording. Topic: Spinal manipulation for tension and migraine headaches Discussion: Smits reviewed the materials in the meeting packet for this topic. The subcommittee discussed that the evidence for treatment of migraine headache and tension headache showed moderate to good evidence of lack of effectiveness, which is generally a rationale for removing a service from a Prioritized List pairing. There was some discussion about adding a guideline note specifying what is meant by \"cervicogenic headache.\" The group decided that such a guideline note could be added later if the health plans required assistance with this definition. MOTION: To approve the code changes and coding specification as presented. CARRIES 6-1 (Opposed: Hodges ). Recommended Actions: line 435/414 MIGRAINE 2) Add the following coding specifications to line 563/546 TENSION HEADACHES i. \"OMT and CMT (CPT 98926- 98929, 98940- 98943) line cervicogenic headache (R51).\" Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, Topic: Wearable cardiac defibrillators Discussion: Smits reviewed the packet materials regarding wearable cardiac defibrillators. Sarah Schmidt, represent ing Zoll, the company which manufactures Life Vest, gave testimony that the purpose of this device is a temporary use until ICD placement or until the pat ient has his or her medications optimized and no longer will need an ICD. Ms. Schmid t noted that the studies regarding the effectiveness of Life Vest have difficult ies in their methodology , although she was unsure w hat the issues with the methodology actually were. These methodology iss ues are the reason that no mortality benefit was seen in these studies . Ms. Schmid t stated that there are studies which show what the therapeutic shock rates were, and noted that she can provide these studies to HERC staff . She noted that in the Zoll studies, 74% of patients who received a shock were alive 6 months later. She noted that the Life Vest allows disc harge from hospital sooner. Zoll is currently conducting an RCT of the Life Vest with planned release of the results in fall 2015. Subcommittee discussion centered around how successfully the vests stop ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, and how often the shocks given by the vests are for these arrhythmias . It was noted that the lethal rhythms treated by this device generally have no symptoms other than sudden death, and so cannot be adequately treated by other means besides a bedside defibrillator. There is increasing numbers of requests for these devices. Hospitals and physicians are hesitant to discharge patients without these devices, as there is not another method in place to treat any fatal arrhythmias which might occur at home. Olson requested data on how often these devices are successfully converting serious arrhythmias. If was noted that the lack of evidence of effective reduction in mortality might stem from lack of patient compliance with wearing the device. Hodges noted that Life Vest use can be monitored, and that her health plan takes back the device if it is not being worn 21 or more hours a day. The decision was made to table this topic and have HERC staff find more information on the rate of successful shock of such lethal rhythms as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Action: 1) This topic was tabled until the November, 2014 VBBS meeting. Topic: Fibromyalgia related diagnoses (general conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome) Discussion: Smits reviewed the materials of general conditions related to fibromyalgia . The subcommittee felt that Rheumatism, uns pecified and Fasciitis, Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 7 unspecified should not be moved to the fibromyalgia line as this would raise their priority on the Prioritized List. Smits also reviewed the materials summarizing the research and recommendations regarding chronic fatigue syndrome. There was minimal discussion. MOTION: To approve the code changes and line name change as amended . CARRIES 7-0. Recommended Actions: 1) Move ICD -9 359.9 (Myopathy, unspecified) from lines 75,297,349,381 to the new fibromyalgia line 2) Keep ICD -10 G72.9 (Myopathy, unspecified) on the Excluded List. 3) Add chronic fatigue syndrome (ICD -9 780.71/ICD -10 R53.82) to the new fibromyalgia line Advise DMAP to remove ICD -9 780.71/ICD -10 R53.82 from the Excluded List 4) Change line name to \"Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and Related Disorders \" Topic: Coverage guidance \u2014Hyperbaric O xygen Discussion: Smits reviewed the packet materials regarding hyperbaric oxygen coverage. There was minimal discussion. MOTION: To approve the code and guideline note change as presented . CARRIES 7-0. Recommended Actions: For the biennial review (to be reviewed by HERC later in the day ) 1) Combine the two hyperbaric oxygen lines (lines 336 and 373) into one line placed at line 336 for the next biennial Prioritized List . For review by HERC in November, along with the coverage guidance , for potential inclusion in January 1, 2015 list : 1) Add ICD to line 3 36 TOXIC EFFECT OF GASES, FUMES, AND VAPORS REQUIRING HYPERBARIC OXYGEN 2) Remove from line 336 3) Modify GN 107 as shown in A ppendix A Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 8 Topic: Coverage guidance \u2014percutaneous interventions for cervical spine pain Discussion: The summary document was reviewed. A mistake in the recommendations was found: CPT 64490- 64495 was proposed for exclusion as well as for addition to 3 lines on the Prioritized List. The proposed placement on the Excluded l ist was a mistake. Hodges cautioned that there would be a large demand for these types of procedures is coverage is added. Gibson expressed concern that the recommendations from HTAS to cover cervical epidural steroid injections and facet joint neurotomy were weak and based on a weak level of evidence. Shaffer commented that HTAS was led to recommend coverage based on the evidence plus clinical expertise and a desire to avoid more costly alternatives, such as spinal surgery. Gibson noted that the CCOs could elect to cover these procedures for cases in which they would help avoid a surgery, without adding these services to the Prioritized List and requiring coverage in all cases. He was concerned about adding these procedures to the Prioritized List based on weak evidence and provider testimony. The HTAS report was reviewed. The rational for recommending adding coverage for epidural spinal steroid injections was found to be \"Though quality of evidence from trusted sources is very low, there is evidence fr om additional sources, namely a retrospective single cohort study, of some benefit when the recommended criteria are met. Additionally, other payer policies include a similar recommendation, namely Medicare and Washington State's payer policies.\" Williams expressed concern over using a retrospective cohort study as the basis for the decision. There was general concern over the low level of evidence and over using other payer policies as a deciding factor for adding a service to the Prioritized List. However, some members noted that these types of procedures may prevent surgery, reduce ER visits, lower narcotic use, and have other beneficial outcomes. HERC staff clarified that currently, epidural steroid injections are a ncillary. This was felt to give these procedures the same status as procedures already included for coverage on the Prioritized List \u2014such procedures must have evidence of ineffectiveness or evidence of harm or lower cost effectiveness compared to other procedures in order to be taken off the Prioritized List and therefore take away existing coverage. Procedures considered for initial addition to the list have a higher bar \u2014they must have good evidence of effectiveness. The group initially felt that ancillary procedures should have the low er bar of evidence for inclusion on the List. However, this topic was readdressed later in the meeting, and several subcommittee members expressed concern with this policy. It was felt that many a ncillary procedures were never formally reviewed and had a formal placement decision. Therefore, these procedures should be fully reviewed before addition to the List, just like new procedures. HERC staff agreed that this policy needed to be discussed further and placed it on the agenda for the VBBS/HERC retreat in October. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 9 Hodges noted that clarification of when epidural steroids should be covered, such as in the proposed guideline, would be very helpful for the CCOs as these procedures are currently covered as a ncillary. Shaffer noted that these injections are treatments and do not belong on the Ancillary List. Therefore, some placement decision needs to be made. The subcommittee members noted that facet joint neurotomy was currently excluded. The evidence summary in the HTAS report stated that the recomme ndation for addition to coverage was based on the following: \"Though quality of evidence from trusted sources is very low, the evidence shows there is some benefit when the recommended criteria are met. Coverage with these criteria was recommended by appointed expert.\" There was general agreement that expert opinion was not good enough evidence to justify coverage when the quality of evidence from trusted sources was very low. The group felt that facet joint neurotomy should not be added to the List. Initially, the subcommittee voted to approve the addition of epidural steroid injections with the appropriate guideline and to not approve the addition of facet joint injections (Vote 6-0 with Pollack abstaining). However, this decision was reopened at a later point in the meeting and voided (Vote 7- 0). The subcommittee wished to have this topic returned for further discussion to their November meeting. Actions: 1) HERC staff will add a discussion about the level of evidence required for adding ancillary procedures to the Prioritized List to the VBBS/HERC agenda for the October retreat 2) This topic was tabled for further discussion in November. Topic: Guideline Note 37, Disorders Of S pine With Neurologic Impairment Discussion: Smits introduced the summary document on this topic. There was no discussion. MOTION: To approve the guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 7- 0. Recommended Action: 1) GN 37 was modified as shown in Appendix A Topic: Rehabilitation guideline Discussion: Smits reviewed the packet materials regarding suggested changes to the rehabilitation guideline. Olson expressed frustration with the medical directors requesting changes to V bBS decisions when they are not coming to Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 10 VbBS meetings. Smits noted that there has not been a medical director representative on the V bBS for over a year, since Chris Kirk left. This meeting is the first official meeting for the new medical director representative, Holly Jo Hodges, who promised to bring the medical directors input to the V bBS meetings going forward. The subcommittee felt that the staff recommended wording, including the suggesting additional wording, for the rehabilitation guideline was acceptable. MOTION: To approve the guideline note changes as presented with additional optional langua ge in the meeting materials. CARRIES 7- 0. Recommended Action: 1) Modify the rehabilitation guideline wording as shown in Appendix A Topic: Lymphedema guideline Discussion: Smits presented the summary on proposed changes to the lymphedema guideline. John Beckwith, PT, testified that he was very concerned that the language in the guideline be very clear that compression dressings/garments were covered even when no complications were present. The subcommittee felt that the wording was sufficient. Hodges requested that clarification be made to the guideline to specify whether compression dressings included compression garments. Smits offered amended wording , adding in the term \"garments. \" Beckwith requested that chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) be covered for compression dressings when appropriate. Smits reviewed her previous findings that CVI includes a range of conditions, from very mild to quite severe. It would be difficult to write a guideline specifying at what stage CVI was covered. The subcommitt ee requested that HERC staff work with experts to see if some coverage of compression dressings/garments should be done for CVI. MOTION: To approve the guideline note changes as amend ed. CARRIES 7-0. Recommended Actions: 1) GN 43 was modified as shown in Ap pendix A 2) HERC st aff to evaluate potential coverage of compression dressings/garments for chronic venous insufficiency and bring back for subcommittee review at a future date Topic: Denture guideline Discussion: This topic was tabled until the November, 2014 V bBS meeting. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 11 Topic: Adenoidectomy \u2014revisions to the obstructive sleep apnea guideline and sinusitis surgery guideline Discussion: This topic was tabled until the November, 2014 V bBS meeting. Topic: RSV guideline Discussion: Livingston reviewed the summary document for proposed revisions to the RSV guideline. The CCO representatives testified that referring to P&T criteria would not be acceptable to them. The CCOs have their own committees and develop their own coverage criteria. They do not attend or participate in DMAP 's P&T Committee meetings and do not feel that their preferences or opinions are taken into account in the P&T decision making process. If no guideline referring to P&T was adopted, then coverage of Synagis would revert to the individual CCO P&T committee decisions (or DMAP P&T coverage guidance for fee- for-service patients). This was felt to be the preferable alternative. There was also public comment received from Paul Nielson, AstraZeneca, who raised concerns about the quali ty of the new American Academy of Pediatrics guideline on RSV prophylaxis. The subcommittee decided to not adopt a new guideline referring to DMAP P&T criteria. However, it was recognized that the current Synagis guideline was out of compliance with national coverage recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Because DMAP and CCO P&T committee decisions can be much more timely than VbBS/HERC guideline note changes, the subcommittee decided to remove the Synagis guideline and similar drug related guidelines and not add any guidelines referring to DMAP P&T decisions. MOTION: To approve the guideline note deletion but reject the proposed new guideline note . CARRIES 7- 0. Recommended Action: 1) Delete GN 69 Topic: Botulinum toxin Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document regarding Botox. The VbBS had previously indicated that they did not wish to have guidelines referring to the DMAP P&T coverage criteria (see \" RSV guideline \" discussion above). The proposed new guideline referring to P&T criteria was therefore not accepted. MOTION: To approve the coding changes, coding specifications and guideline note deletion but not the proposed new guideline note . CARRIES 7- 0. Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 12 Recommended Actions: 1) Add 46505 ( of internal anal FISSURE 2) Remove (Chemodenervation of extraocular muscle) from line 397/ 372 AMBLYOPIA 3) Do not add coverage for botulinum toxin injections for treatment of neck or lower back pain or chronic daily headaches 4) Keep the coding specification shown below on line 388/364 DYSTONIA (UNCONTROLLABLE); LARYNGEAL SPASM injection (CPT 64612, 64616) is included on this line 333.89/ICD - 10-CM G24.9).\" 5) Add the coding specification shown below to line 318/297 NEUROLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION IN POSTURE AND MOVEMENT CAUSED BY CHRONIC CONDITIONS a. \"Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 64642 -64647) is included on this line for treatment of upper and lower limb spasticity specification shown below to lines 452 STRABISMUS WITHOUT AMBLYOPIA AND OTHER DISORDERS OF BINOCULAR EYE ANOMALI 398 STRABISMUS AND OTHER CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF EYE; LACRIMAL DUCT OBSTRUCTION CHILDREN a. \"Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 67345) is included on this line for the treatment of strabismus due to other neurological disorders (ICD -9 378.73 /ICD -10 H50.89).\" 7) Add the coding specification shown below to line 421 ACHALASIA, NON - NEONATAL/382 ESOPHAGEAL STRICTURE; with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 43201) is included on this line for treatment of achalasia (ICD -9 530.0/ICD -10 K22.0).\" 8) Add the coding specification shown below to line 542/523 DISORDERS OF SWEAT GLANDS b. \"Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin injection (CPT 64650, 64653) is included on this line for hyperhidrosis GUIDELINE NOTE 103, CHEMODENERVATION OF THE BLADDER Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 13 Topic: Gender dysphoria Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document in the meeting packet. There was considerable discussion regarding concerns for lack of an age restriction for surgical procedures. Smits reviewed that the Oregon age of consent for surgical procedures is age 15. Olson felt that these types of procedures should not be singled out for restriction until age 18 or even higher , as many other procedures which have life- long impact can be consented to at age 15. Expert testimony by Danielle Askini from Basic Rights Oregon and Jenn Burleton from TransActive indicated that youth are required to have extensive evaluations by qualified mental health professionals and that the year of hormone therapy required in the guideline acts as another safeguard against rash decis ions by youth. There was a minor edit to the proposed guideline to add in a missing word. MOTION: To approve the line rescoring, updated treatment description, and the addition of cross -sex hormone therapy and various surgical procedures related to sex reassignment to the gender dysphoria line, and the new guideline as amended (Opposed: Tyack, Absent: Pollack) . Recommended Change treatment description of the gender dysphoria line to MEDICAL/PSYCHOTHERAPY MEDICAL AND SURGICAL TREATMENT ; PSYCHOTHERAPY 2) Rescore the gender dysphoria line as shown below : a. Scoring proposal Category: 6 HL: 6 Suffering: 4 Population effects: 0 Vulnerable population: 0 Tertiary prevention: 3 Effectiveness: 2 Need for service: 1 Net cost: 2 Score : 1040 Approximate line placement: 312 3) Add cross -sex hormone therapy to the new gender dysphoria Advise DMAP to remove CPT 55970 and 55980 from the Excluded List Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 14 5) Modify the guideline for the new gender dysphoria line as shown in Appendix A 6) Note that all of these recommended actions would take effect on January 1, 2015 when the new gender dysphoria line appears on the Prioritized L ist Topic: Hepatitis C Discussion: Livingston reviewed the summary document regarding treatments for hepatitis C in the meeting packet. Written testimony from CCOs , legislators and concerned citizens was received. The following public testimony was received verbally: Amy Burns and Mark Bradshaw from AllCare presented a collaborati ve statement from 9 CCOs. The collective strongly discouraged a guideline note requiring CCOs to adhere to the P&T Committee's drug use criteria. They strongly felt that each CCO manages their own drug use and formularies and this drug class should be no different. They also had specific concerns about the criteria including: 1) Allowing off -label use of simeprevir and sofosburiv 2) Allowing for off -label use for patients who are post transplant. This goes against OAR s that do not allow for investigational or experimental practices. There is no outcome data to support this. The l iver transplant population has not been studied and is not recommended in the Sovaldi package insert. 3) Subjective language around who can prescribe 4) Important psychosocial and medical factors around treatment that aren't addressed Jim Gardner, Oregon Council for PhMRA, a paid advocate, recommended not looking at single therapeutic products and raised legal concerns with this approach. Ann Murray, Bristol Myers Squibb, stated that she thinks this would be the first time HERC would have taken this approach, in which a treatments for a condition appear both on a funded and unfunded line. Subcommittee members made a request to PhRMA to decrease the cost of the drug, with the answer th at they appreciated the comment. Kimberly Wyatt, Willamette Valley Community Health CCO and Dr. Seth Adams, pharmacist with WVCH , offered public comment. They stated they have their own pharmacy and therapeutics committee and have already created PA criteria for approval of these medications. It is important to the CCOS to have freedom to develop their own criteria. If there was going to be Value-based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes, 8-14 -14 Page 15 accountability to another organization (DMAP 's P&T Committee ) then CCOs would have wanted to be responsible in the development of these criteria. Subcommittee members asked about the CCOs concerns regarding criteria in the proposed guideline note for drug and alcohol testing. It was clarified that they felt 6 months sobr iety was too short of a time. They also require a mental health evaluation to assess readiness to treat and ascertain whether patients are compliant with prescription drugs for other diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. Lorren Sandt, from Caring Ambassadors, and BJ Cavnor, 1 in 4 Chronic Disease, testified as well, both stat ing pharmaceutical funding for their organizations. San dt requested hepatitis C drug treatments should remain above the funding line and that everyone with hepatitis C should be treated with these drugs. She also pointed to the AASLD/IDSA guideline not requiring abstinence or sobriety. Cav nor requested a workgroup that would follow national guidelines and demanded that all people be allowed to come to the table. Dr. Ken t Benner offered testimony with no current conflicts of interest. He spoke about the community standard that was developed by local hepatologists , and discussed the rationale for this. Subcommitee members discussed the significant impact of these medications on the budget. There was a proposal to table the decision. Given the concerns CCO s have about the reference to P&T criteria , the need for ongoing dialogue, the new AASLD guidelines, it was felt that a final decision on this policy should be tabled until a future meeting. It was clarified that there will be a pharmacoeconomic anlaysis available by the November meeting and that an update d DERP report and NIC E guidelines may be available later this year or early next year as well. MOTION: To reject the proposed new guideline regarding treatment of hepatitis C and table the topic until a future meeting. CARRIES 7-0.

CALL TO ORDER Jim MacKay called the meeting of the Health Technology Assessment S ubcommittee (HTAS) to order at 1:00 pm. 2. MINUTES REVIEW No changes were made to the June, 2014 minutes. Minutes approved 3-0 (Keenen not present) . 3. REVIEW OF DRAFT COVERAGE GUIDANCE A) Alternatives to Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) Wally Shaffer reviewed the draft coverage guidance, noting that there are a large number of different procedures listed in the coverage guidance, some of which are not compared to TURP, which is the reference procedure. This topic will require expert input especialy because the source report is British and some procedures may not be in common use in Oregon. Only procedures which have been compared to TURP are included in the draft coverage recommendation. In addition, new technologies may have become available since the source review which was done in 2010. He introduced Dr. Eugene Fuchs, a Portland urologist who will serve as ad hoc expert for this topic. Fuchs noted that the TURP procedure used as a reference in the studies is no longer commonly used, as it's been replaced by bipolar TURP which has the advantages of less bleeding and also no risk of water intoxication (a serious side effect) . Though the literature mostly compares the older TURP procedure, in practice the subcommittee HTAS 9/22/14 Minutes Page 1 needs to compare the other interventions to the bipolar procedure; although there has not been a head -to-head trial, bipolar TURP is much more commonly used. The committee requested that staff add a footnote to the coverage guidance making clear where the study comparator was monopolar TURP. Fuchs also said there is little level 1 evidence for these other procedures other than the PVP laser procedure. Ahmann asked wheher the comparisons are still valid, given that there is an improved surgical procedure; Brian Shaffer, an audience member who is a Portland urologist , said that monopolar TURP operations are seldom used. In addition, he said you can't do as good a job with a laser as with bipolar TURP in many cases, and it takes longer , though laser vaporization is preferable when the patient is anticoagulated. Also, when a tumor is excised using electricity, there is tumor tissue for pathology, wher eas the laser vaporizes the tumor so it can be hard to know how much tissue has been removed. Wally Shaffer reviewed the GRADE table, noting that resource allocation was listed as low for outpatient procedures and moderate for inpatient procedures. He also noted that there is not likely to be a lot of patient preference as the variability will be driven largely by provider preference and availability. However , Fuchs noted that patients do request laser procedures after doing Internet research, so patient preference is a factor in his practice. In the discussion on HoLEP, Fuchs noted the lack of level 1 evidence; however , the subcommittee did not change its recommendation. Fuchs clarified that unlike the other laser techniques listed as laser vaporization, HoLEP is a laser enucleation technique and there is a specimen at the end of the surgery, though it also involves some vaporization as well. They also noted that the TUVP and TUVRP procedures are often done together (that is, the surgeon does some vaporization and some resection) and are adequately covered by the recommendation for coverage of TUVP , which Wally Shaffer noted should be a weak recommendation based on the low strength of evidence. TUVP is also known as the \"button\" procedure. For the laser vaporization techniques, Fuchs and Brian Shaffer said that the newer lasers are higher powered and therefore superior to many of the interventions done in the studies from the literature. One in particular is known as PVP or the \"greenlight\", and has better evidence to support it compared to bipolar TURP. MacKay suggested that this evidence be incorporated into the draft coverage guidance. The subcommittee noted the distinction between various laser techniques and discussed merging them all into a single recommendation but then decided to merge some lines and keep others separate. Brian Shaffer said there is an older laser coagulation technique that is questionable and no longer in use, but the laser vaporization techniques could be combined. Little confirmed that this wouldn't be problematic, as the distinctions in the evidence aren't all that significant, and the source guideline was based largely on expert opinion. The subcommittee clarified that laser coagulation could remain not recommended and that outdated laser vaporization techniques should not be recommended. After discussion of the various techniques, the subcommittee settled on classifying the procedures listed with a strong recommendation as follows: HTAS 9/22/14 Minutes Page 2 Bipolar TURP Laser vaporization/resection; for example, photoselective vaporization of the laser Prostate) TUIP (Transurethral Incision of the Prostate) The subcommittee wanted to list specific procedures under these categories as new technologies may be developed and many will fall into these categories. Wally Shaffer noted that one procedure seemed to have less evidence, the bipolar TUVP. It shows better results than TURP but but the strength of evidence is lower. Af ter discussion the subcommittee decided to make a weak recommendation for coverage based on expert opinion as well as the evidence. Brian Shaffer suggested that this procedure is often used in conjunction with a TURP to add additional coagulation. Discussion moved to the remaining topics with a weak recommendation in the draft. Brian Shaffer noted that TUNA and TUMT are in- office procedures. Although they are inferior to some other alternatives they may be appropriate for patients who are not good candidates for the more invasive procedures. There is a role for each of these procedures in different types of patients. After discussion the subcommittee decided to give them a weak recommendation for coverage to ensure availability of these procedures fo r those who could not tolerate a more invasive procedure. The subcommittee then discussed the procedures not recommended for coverage in the draft. They determined that the HoLRP is the same as HoLEP, so eliminated that recommendation. For botulinum toxin, HIFU, TEAP and prostatic urethral lifts, the subcommittee affirmed the weak recommendation against coverage. For Transurethral Artery Embolization the subcommittee decided to make a strong recommendation against coverage as it is still investigational in this country. Fuchs said it is being done in highly selected patients at OHSU by interventional radiologists ; he had one success but it is considered experimental . Brian Shaffer said he had a position paper from the Society of Interventional Radiologists saying it is a technically challenging procedure with possibility of complications and that they need more data. Shaffer noted that this may be covered for selected patients in CCOs and in the appeals process in the Oregon Health Plan. The subcommittee heard additional public comment from Suzy Geroux from American Medical Systems, which manufactures a laser device known as the green light laser or PVP or laser vaporization. She said it shows fewer side effects and better cost effectiveness as shown by Medicare data compared to other less invasive techniques used in the United States. PVP uses a KTP crystal or LDO crystal known as a green light which does make a difference. Sh e testified that the wavelength of the laser does matter. The current green light system uses a frequency which was not available for the NICE study. She included some references to studies showing prospective randomized trials sponsored by her company, and said that the 12- month data is in final review to be published in the Journal of Urology soon. She noted that the subcommittee already made the change she is advocating, moving PVP to recommended for coverage. She also noted that HIFU is not approved for use in the U.S. outside of clinical trials. HTAS 9/22/14 Minutes Page 3 She also said that TUVP is described several different ways in the coverage guidances. Some places it's described as electrovaporization. In terms of commonly accepted language they describe the TUVP as the rol ler ball. Fuchs and Brian Shaffer agreed that the roller ball is inferior to the button because of geometry though it is used for coagulation. After discussion of her comments the subcommittee removed its earlier recommendation against outdated laser vaporizations, and clarified the distinction between electrovaporization and laser vaporization as it could cause confusion. They asked staff to update the GRADE table, removing irrelevant comparisons and services for which there is no recommendation, but to leave the algorithms as they are since they reflect the evidence. After discussion, the subcommittee approved the draft coverage guidance to be posted for public comment after staff makes changes conf orming with the current discussion. Motion approved 4- 0. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE For men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostate enlargement, coverage of surgical procedures is recommended only if symptoms are severe, or if drug treatment and conservative management options have been unsuccessful or are not appropriate. ( strong recommendation) The following are coverage recommendations regarding surgical alternatives to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): Recommended for coverage ( recommendation): Bipolar TURP Laser vaporization/resection; for example, photoselective vaporization of laser Prostate) TUIP (Transurethral Incision of the Prostate) Recommended for coverage ( weak recommendation): TUNA (Transurethral Needle Ablation of Prostate) TUMT Microwave Bipolar TUVP Not recommended for coverage ( weak recommendation): Botulinum toxin HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) TEAP (Transurethral Ethanol Ablation of the Prostate) Prostatic urethral lifts for coverage ( strong recommendation): coagulation HTAS 9/22/14 Minutes Page 4 Prostatic artery embolization B) ADVANCED IMAGING IN THE STAGING OF PROSTATE CANCER Wally Shaffer presented the draft coverage guidance. Keenen asked whether ultrasound should be included. Wally Shaffer said it should be part of the workup but is not specifically in scope as advanced imaging . Little pointed out that the scope of the guidance is for patients who have already received a diagnosis, which would include the ultrasound- guided biopsy. The subcommittee elected not to put a strength of recommendation on this initial paragraph since its purpose is to set the context of the other recommendations, and evidence surrounding it was not evaluated. Shaffer noted that there is some discussion comparing ultrasound to MRI in the guidance, but MRI is superior. Ultrasound is only included as a comparat or. Ahmann said there may be controversy around the draft recommendation regarding MRI, which may be used to determine whether the cancer is extracapsular so that the surgeon could know that before surgery. But MRIs can give false information. The subcommittee discussed the use of the word routine around radionuclide bone scanning. Shaffer said if someone has back or hip pain and it's not clear whether it is related to the cancer , a bone scan may make sense. After discussion the subcommittee decided to leave the word routine in for this indication. For PET scan, the subcommittee elected to remove the word routine as there is no evidence of benefit. In addition they decided to delete the paragraph \" Imaging is not recommended for [routine] coverage in men with prostate cancer who are not candidates for radical treatment. (weak/strong recommendation) \", as it is too vague to implement and the recommendations above are sufficient . No additional changes to the draft coverage guidance were made. After discussion, the subcommittee approved the draft coverage guidance to be posted for public comment after staff makes changes conf orming with the current discussion. Motion approved 4- 0. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE To determine risk status and treatment options, prostate cancer clinical staging that includes PSA level and prostate biopsy with Gleason score is recommended for coverage. MRI is recommended for coverage for men with histologically proven prostate cancer if knowledge of the T or N stage coul d affect management. (strong recommendation) CT of the pelvis is not recommended for coverage in men with low - to intermediate -risk localized prostate cancer, unless MRI is contraindicated. (strong recommendation) HTAS 9/22/14 Minutes Page 5 Radionuclide bone scanning is not recomm ended for routine coverage in men with localized prostate cancer. (weak recommendation) Radionuclide bone scanning is recommended for coverage when hormone therapy is being deferred (through watchful waiting) in asymptomatic men who are at high risk of developing bone complications. (strong recommendation) PET imaging is not recommended for coverage in prostate cancer. (strong recommendation) 4. REVIEW RESCAN OF TOPICS APPROVED IN 2012 Little explained that these reviews are part of the normal process to consider which coverage guidances may merit an update. It is part of the HERC's process to complete such a review every two years. She reviewed the topics in the meeting packet. A) Artificial disks Keenen said for lumbar artificial disks that he doesn't understand the controversy as these cost less than the alternatives and have been shown to be equal to a fusion. The unknown is whether it spares future degeneration. They are not failing o r falling out. The cervical disk gets better results than lumbar. There is an FDA approval for a 2 -level disk. At some point he believes there will be data to show that it's better, particular in the cervical spine. The single level artificial disks were recommended by the previous guidelines. After discussions the subcommittee decided not to update the guidance as it was unlikely the recommendation would change. B) MRI for breast cancer screening. Little said that NICE and Washington state have new reports coming out, so the subcommittee asked to re- evaluate once both of these reports are out. C) Lumbar discography The subcommittee agreed not to re -evaluate this topic as no new information has been published other than the Hayes review. D) Hip resurfacing The subco mmittee decided not to initiate a new review. E) Viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the knee The subcommittee wants to re - evaluate this topic once the new AHRQ report comes out. The subcommittee voted 4- 0 to say no further reviews are needed at this time. For MRI for Breast Cancer and Viscosupplementation, the subcommittee would like to consider initiating a review when the additional studies noted above are available. 5. NEXT TOPICS Shaffer proposed three new topics: recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein, genetic tests of cancer tissue for potential response to treatment, and proton beam therapy. After discussion, the subcommittee decided that the recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein was a lower priority than the other two and staff can choose which of these to pursue.

The next meeting is scheduled for November 24, 2014 from 1:00 -4:00pm in Room 117B &C of the Meridian Park Hospital Community Health Education Center in Tualatin.

CALL TO ORDER Wiley Chan called the meeting of the Evidence- based Guidelines Subcommittee (EbGS ) to order at 2:10 pm. 2. MINUTES REVIEW No changes were made to the June 5, 2014 minutes. Minutes approved 6- 0. 3. STAFF REPORT Livingston provided an updated on the Evaluation of evidence for applied behavioral analysis for autism spectrum disorder. There was minimal discussion. A typo was noted and corrected . Motion approved to accept the revised version, passed 6-0 (Absent: Stecker) . EbGS 9/4/14 Minutes Page 1 4. COVERAGE GUIDANCE SCANNING Little discussed the process for reviewing coverage guidances and scanning for new evidence. There was a discussion as to how the update will be documented in the coverage guidances themselves and on the website if there are no changes based on the update d evidence review. The group decided to add the updated citations to within the coverage guidance itself and to add a notation saying that the coverage guidance remains unchanged based on an updated evidence review as of a certain date . The details of the updated citations may be kept separately, and available on the website. Scanning updates were performed for: Management of chr onic otitis media in children - there was minimal discussion. Indications for planned cesarean section - there was minimal di scussion. Knee arthroscopy for osteoarthritis - there was minimal discussion. Neuroimaging in dementia o Subcommittee members discussed a concern about planning and management decisions based on information that could be obtained through neuroimaging . EbGS decided to update the Coverage G uidance once two or three forthcoming reviews are published. Subcommittee members reaffirmed reevaluation every two years but in this particular case since trusted source reviews were found to be in process, these would be evaluated once published. They agreed that occasional variance from the standard two- year timeline would be appropriate in certain circumstances. Routine ultrasound in pregnancy - there was minimal discussion. Non-pharmacologic interventions for treatment -resistant depression o The subcommittee discussed the conflicting conclusions of the updated evidence sources. The fact that there are unpublished completed studies suggest s publication bias. Joondeph raised concerns about the issue of quality of life and whether this determines policy decision. Historically this had violated the ADA because of discrimination against people with disabilities. The re was a discussion that incremental quality of life is valuable regardless of disability status and that it is usually one of many outcomes considered in determining an intervention' s effectiveness. EbGS directed staff to investigate if transcranial magn etic stimulation (and direct subtype) is something that is done frequently and is worthwhile to investigate further given new conflicting assessments of the evidence. Advanced imaging for low back pain - there was minimal discussion. Low Back Pain: pharmacologic Interventions - there was minimal discussion. Low Back Pain: non- pharmacologic, non- invasive interventions - there was minimal discussion. Recommended Action s to HERC: 1) No changes based on updated evidence review: o Management of chronic otitis media in children EbGS 9/4/14 Minutes Page 2 o Indications for planned cesarean section o Knee arthroscopy for osteoarthritis o Routine ultrasound in pregnancy 2) Revisit once more information available : o Non-pharmacologic interventions for treatment -resistant depression - specifically transcranial magnetic stimulation 3) Review once updated trusted sources are available: o Neuroimaging in dementia o Advanced imaging for low back pain - o Low Back Pain: Pharmacologic i nterventions o Low Back Pain: N on-pharmacologic, no n-invasive interventions o Percu taneous interventions low back pain Motion Approved 6-0 (Absent: Stecker) . 5. REVIEW OF NEW DRAFT COVERAGE GUIDANCES A. Topic HOME BIRTH Livingston presented the Draft Coverage Guidance on Home Birth, reviewing the evidence, algorithm and proposed GRADE table. There was a extensive discussion about the quality of evidence available and the extrapolation of the evidence to the U.S. It was concluded that because observational studies are used, there is a major question of selection bias. Dr. Melissa Cheyney , the appointed midwifery expert , joined via phone conference. Cheyney discussed how the training of midwives in the U.S. is much more variable. She explained that the International Confederation of Midwives lays out standards. In the U.S there are two trajectories for becoming a direct entry midwife. One involves schooling and the other allows credentialing simply through apprenticeship without every going to school. Sixty percent of currently credentialed m idwives used the path to licensure without completing midwifery schooling. Thirty percent of certified midwives in the U.S. do not meet international criterial. Unlicensed midwives in Oregon are no longer allowed to practice after January 1, 2015. She also addressed how data is skewed because most of it is not about intended place of delivery (resulting in pregnancies related to planned home births which transfer to a hospital being counted as hospital births) . She addressed high transfer rates, especially of nulliparous women. Based on the available evidence it was agreed that it appears home birth is safe when performed by highly trained people in a system set up for normative home births. The education of midwives who participated in the studies (performed outside of the United States) is remarkably different than in the U.S. I t was EbGS 9/4/14 Minutes Page 3 clarified that the choice of home birth appears to be safe if we assume the intervention is the same in the United States as to the other studies ., However , it was acknowledged that training and systems of care are significantly different (and weaker) in the U.S. than in the studied countries. Subcommittee members also recognized that there are strong values and preferences that need to be respected. Subcommitee members reviewed the GRADE table. As a result of discussions the following changes were made: Quality of e vidence rating was downgraded to low because of the issues of selection bias and external validity Balance of b enefits and h arms: \"possible\" was added to qualify that the potential benefit can not be proven based on the low quality of evidence Intervention language was changed to \"Planned home birth\" Values and pr eferences was discussed and changed to \" low\" variability for planned home birth. The recommendation for planned home birth among low risk women was downgraded to \"weak\" based on the revised changes. The Coverage Guidance Development F ramework pathway for low risk women was changed to 2a1b, and in unselected women was changed to 2A2. Action: Due to time constraints, the draft coverage guidance box language was not reviewed. Changes to the GRADE table and algorithm were made as described. The d raft coverage guidance will be revisited at the November meeting and submitted for public comment at that time. 6. REVIEW OF PUBLIC COMMENTS A) Topic NUCLEAR CARDIAC IMAGING Little reviewed the public comment disposition document. Dr. Steve Heitner participated as the invited expert. He shared the importance of adding the word \"asymptomatic\" to clarify noncoverage for screening. There was a concern about lack of geographic access to stress echo. The coverage guidance box language was amended to include unavailability of stress echo. It was stated that there was evidence supporting equal efficacy, lower cost, and lower harm for stress echo as compared to SPECT . Subcommittee m embers recommend that the public comment disposition be updated to reflect this succinctly. There was an extensive discussion about the benefits of theorectically superior physiologic information, but which has unknown implications for health outcomes when compared to stress echo. Heitner shared EbGS 9/4/14 Minutes Page 4 that ischemia as assessed by echo prognosticates in the same manner as by SPECT. They also discussed how viability assessment is included in the exceptions ( e.g. pre-existing cardiomyopathy). They agreed that it is important to maintain access to diagnostic testing for clinicians , but the weight of evidence does not support superiority of SPECT at this time. SPECT would be indicated in select circumstances when stress echo would not provide optimal results. They agreed the following changes should be made to the draft Coverage Guidance: 1) Modify the box to allow SPECT coverage when stress echo is unavailable 2) Add \"asymptomatic\" to clarify screening populations 3) Edit the public comment disposition to clarify the evidence and decision- making A motion was made to approve the revised dr aft coverage guidance and forward to HERC. Motion approved 7-0. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE PET is not recommended for coverage for screening or diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) (strong recommendation). Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is not recommended for coverage for screening for CAD in asymptomatic patients (strong recommendation). SPECT is not recommended for coverage for diagnosis or risk stratification of CAD (strong recommendation) \u2014except in patients for whom stress imaging is required and stress ECHO is contraindicated, is unavailable or would provide suboptimal imaging *) *i.e. pre-existing cardiomyopathy, baseline regional wall motion abnormalities, left bundle branch block, paced rhythm, unsuitable acoustic windows due to body habitus, inability to utilize dobutamine in a setting where exercise is not possible or when the target workload is not achievable B) Topic ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Little reviewed the public comments disposition document. There was minimal discussion. The subcommittee agreed to delete the sentence referring to the risk of stroke being up to 8% per year based on the public comment that had concerns about this number. A motion was made to approve the revised draft coverage guidance and forward to HERC. Motion approved 7- 0. EbGS 9/4/14 Minutes Page 5 HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE AV node ablation is recommended for coverage only in persons with inadequate ventricular rate control resulting in symptoms, left ventricular systolic dysfunction or substantial risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Coverage is recommended only when pharmacological therapy for rate control is ineffective or not tolerated (weak recommendation) . Transcatheter pulmonary vein isolation is recommended for coverage for those who remain symptomatic from atrial fibrillation despite rate control medications and antiarrhythmic medications (strong recommendation) . Surgical ablation (pulmonary vein isolation or Maze procedure) for atrial fibrillation is recommended for coverage at the time of other cardiac surgery for patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control medications ( weak recommendation) . 7. PUBLIC COMMENT No additional public comment was received. 8. ADJOURNMENT The meeting was adjourned at 5:00 p m.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background Genetic testing detects alterations in DNA or chromosomes. Human genetic testing requires laboratory analyses of DNA, which is isolated from biologic samples, including cells, blood, or amniotic fluid. Tests for more than 1,300 genetic conditions are available. Genetic tests can be used to diagnose, predict risk for a future disease, inform reproductive decision- making, and manage patient care. There are eight categories of genetic testing: diagnostic, predictive, pharmacogenomic, prenatal, carrier, preimpl antation, newborn, and research testing. This guidance document will focus only on recommendations for prenatal, carrier and diagnostic genetic testing. Prenatal testing is used to identify a fetus's genes or chromosomes before birth and is offered during pregnancy based on the risk that the baby will have a genetic or chromosomal disorder. Carrier testing is used to identify people who carry one copy of a gene mutation, which can cause a genetic disorder if two copies are present. Carrier testing is primar ily offered to those with a family history of a specific genetic disorder and high-risk ethnic groups. Diagnostic testing is used to identify a specific genetic or chromosomal condition, and to confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected. Evidence Review General Prenatal Testing A search of guideline databases (MED core sources plus the American College of Medical Genetics and the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists) was conducted from 2008 to present and identified 28 guidelines, three of which addressed general prenatal care [NICE (2008), VA/DoD (2009), and ICSI (Akkerman [ICSI] 2012)]. All three were rated good quality and provided detailed guidance on general prenatal care, with specific recommendations related to genetic testing. All three recommend screening Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 3 measures and testing indications for aneuploidy screening, general risk assessment and screening options for hemoglobinopathies, cystic fibrosis, and structural abnormalities. One guideline addresses screening for Tay -Sachs di sease. Recommendations from all three guidelines are consistent with a few exceptions: Ultrasound screening for structural anomalies is recommended only by NICE (optional for ICSI and VA/DoD); and Method of aneuploidy screening is specified only by NICE, which recommends the combined test in the first trimester as the most desirable strategy. The other two guidelines do not recommend one strategy for testing over another. NICE does not recommend carrier testing for cystic fibrosis Prenatal genetic testing recommendations are summarized and compared in the table below: Indication/T est NICE (2008) VA/DoD (2009) ICSI (2012) Genetic risk assessment Validated questionnaire Validated questionnaire Validated questionnaire Hemoglobinopathies Screen all high - risk ethnic groups1, complete blood count test, hemoglobin electrophoresis test.

If first trimester screening is elected: second- trimester serum AFP screening and/or US should be offered to screen for open neural tube defects. For second trimester serum screening: Quad Marker Screen should be used rather than the Triple Marker Screen.

The results of these tests are held, and the patient then has a quadruple screen test performed between 15 and 19 weeks. At that time, the results of all the studies, combined with risk assessment due to the pat ient's age, are used to present a single- risk figure. Patients at \"high risk\" are offered amniocentesis (Trisomy 21 detection rate = 94- 96%). \"High risk\" is not defined, but qualified with the following language: \"Each clinician/health care organization will establish cutoff values for low and high risk based on laboratory and patient particulars. One system used is 1 in 200 as the cutoff.\" Serum integrated screening: A variation in which the first -trimester PAPP- A test result is combined with a second- trimester quad test to provide a single- risk figure is called a serum integrated screening. (Trisomy 21 detection rate = 85-88%). Stepwise sequential screening: The patient is scanned for nuchal translucency determination and has a serum PAPP -A analysis performed between 10 and 13 weeks. The results of these studies are combined with the patient's age-associated risk, and the patient is given a risk assessment for aneuploidy. The patient may choose at this time to undergo invasive testing (i.e., CVS), or a triple or quad screen at 15- 19 weeks. If the patient has the second- trimester test, a new risk is assessed based on the results of her age and both the first - and second- trimester screening test results (Trisomy 21 detection rate = 95%). Those at \"high risk\" are offered amniocentesis. \"High risk\" is not defined, but qualified with the following language: \"Each clinician/health care organization Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 6 will establish cutoff values for low and high risk based on laboratory and patient particulars. One system used is 1 in 200 as the cutoff.\" Contingency screening: The patient has the same first -trimester study described for the stepwise sequential test and is told the results. If the results are above an arbitrary cutoff, such as 1 in 50, she is offered CVS. If her results are below another arbitrary cutoff, such as 1 in 1,000, she is advised that no further testing is necessary. If the patient's risk falls between these two cutoffs, she is offered a quad screen after 15 weeks, and a new risk assessment is determined as in the stepwise sequential test (Trisomy 21 detection rate = \"high risk\" are offered amniocentesis. \"High risk\" is not defined, but qualified with the following language: \"Each clinician/health care organization will establish cutoff values for low and high risk based on laboratory and patient particulars. One system used is 1 in 200 as the cutoff.\" Genetic Counseling The NICE guideline does not address women with a family history of a genetic disorder, or specify indications for genetic counseling. The ICSI guideline does not specify indications for genetic counseling with the exception of women with a family history of Fragile X disease or mental retardation. The VA/DoD guideline recommend s that genetic counseling be provided to any woman identified as high risk , defined as advanced maternal age, personal or family history of genetic disorder or positive screening tes t result. Specific Prenatal Tests or Testing Techniques A search of clinical evidence sources and guideline databases (MED core sources plus the American College of Medical Genetics and the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists) was conducted from 2003 to present (2008 to present for guidelines). Twenty -four evidence reviews and 28 guidelines were identified, all of which addressed specific genetic tests with the exception of the three general prenatal guidelines discussed above. No quality assessment of the guidelines was done. Fetal Aneu ploidy Prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidy is suggested by use of maternal screening tests, as reviewed above. All such tests have less than perfect sensitivity and require definitive fetal testing if abnormal. Definitive testing for aneuploidy has historically been an invasive procedure, accomplished by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. However, recently, other methods to detect common aneuploidies have been developed. Four of these are outlined below. Quantitative Fluorescent -Polymerase Chain Reaction ( QF-PCR) Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 7 This is a PCR- based technique that consists of amplifying polymorphic markers located on the chromosomes of interest (generally, chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X or Y) to determine the number of copies of those chromosomes present per cell. The advantages of QF -PCR are that it requires a small sample (culture of amniocytes is not required), and the procedure can be automated, providing a rapid turnaround time at a lower cost than conventional cytogenetics. Moreover, diagnostic testing with QF -PCR eliminat es the unexpected or incidental identification of rare chromosomal abnormalities of uncertain significance. No evidence was identified that addressed this test. One guideline was identified, produced by collaboration of the Genetics Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) joined with the Prenatal Diagnosis Committee of the Canadian College of Medical Genetics in 2011. They state that \" QF-PCR is a reliable method to detect trisomies and should replace conventional cytogenetic analysis whenever prenatal testing is performed solely because of an increased risk of aneuploidy in chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X or Y.\" Microarray Testing Microarray testing generally refers to array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), which uses a high resolution analysis of the genome to identify losses or duplications to the chromosome. These deletions and duplications are referred to as copy number variations (CNV). Conventional chromosome analysis using G -banding will detect chromosome anomalies such as trisomies 21, 18 and 13, and monosomy X, along with many structural rearrangements. However, it only detects anomalies to a resolution of 5- 10 Mb (million base -pairs). Array CGH, on the other hand, is capable of detecting changes to a resolution of 1 kb (thousand base- pairs) which is smaller than the average gene, and customized arrays designed for prenatal diagnosis have been developed. One of the challenges of the application of CGH microarrays in the clinical setting is determining whether a copy number imbalance is de novo and likely to be causative, or inherited and likely to be benign. Copy number variants (CNVs) are categorized into those that are likely to be 'benign,' those that are likely to be 'pathogenic' and those of 'unknown clinical significance.' Copy number variants that overlap critical regions of established microdeletion or microduplication syndromes are likely to be pathogeni c, but there is a high incidence of CNVs in the normal population, making the significance of many CNVs uncertain. Although array CGH has higher resolution to detect these small chromosomal changes, it cannot detect balanced rearrangements such as transfor mations or inversions. Identifying CNVs of uncertain significance increases parental anxiety and makes genetic counseling more challenging. Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 8 For microarray testing, a systematic review found that array CGH detected 3.6% additional genomic imbalances when conventional karyotyping was normal, regardless of the reason for performing the study, and increased to 5.2% when the indication for performing the study was a structural malformation on ultrasound. Three guidelines were identified that address array CGH and make similar recommendations. None of the three recommend array CGH testing for pregnancies at low risk of chromosome abnormalities. All three recommend this technology when fetal structural abnormalities are identified on ultrasound or MRI, although one recommends that it be utilized only if conventional karyotyping is normal. All three also recommend genetic counseling for all patients utilizing the technology. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) DNA Testing This is a rapid technique that relies on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) that provides results in one to two days, in which fluorescently labeled DNA probes are bound to fetal cell DNA in a highly selective manner, allowing detection of changes in the number of specific chromosomes by detecting the fluorescence. To detect the most common disorders involving chromosome number, fluorescent probes are used that bind to chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y. However, this technique fails to detect many other potentially harmful changes in chromosomes that can be detected by conventional karyotyping, such as certain rearrangements of segments of chromosomes. One TA was identified that addressed this topic. It included three large studies that compared results obtained with FISH with those obtained with conventional karyotyping. Results suggest that FISH is a highly accurate test for detection of most, but not all, potentially harmful chromosomal abnormalities, with sensitivity and specificity for detection of the targeted abnormalities exceeded 99.5%. However, it is unable to detect 7% to 11% of potentially harmful chromosomal disorders that can be detected by karyotyping. Cell Free Fetal DNA Testing Fetal DNA circulates in maternal blood during pregnancy, making up approximately 10% of all circu lating DNA. Recently, cell free DNA testing has been used to identify common aneuploidies. These tests utilize maternal blood, from which fetal DNA can be isolated as early as ten weeks gestation. Repeated parallel sequencing can then detect an excess of the chromosome of interest of fetal origin, indicating the specific aneuploidy. Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 9 No evidence was identified in the MED report. One guideline recommends that cell free DNA testing be offered to patients at increased risk of aneuploidy5. They recommend that it NOT be a part of routine prenatal laboratory measurements or be offered to low risk women. The Blue Cross TEC Assessment Program analyzed this technology and identified eight studies that reported on the performance of cff -DNA for trisomy 21 screening in singleton high- risk pregnancies. They found that cff -DNA testing reduced the number of invasive confirmatory procedures needed and consequent associated miscarriages, while improving the number of detected cases of trisomy 21, compared to standard screening procedures in high- risk populations of pregnant women. They therefore concluded that ccf -DNA meets the TEC criteria. Tay-Sachs Disease Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficient activity of the enzyme hexosaminidase A (Hex A). It occurs in 1 in 2500 children of Ashkenazi Jewish parents, and is most common among people who are Ashkenazi Jewish, French- Canadian, or Cajun. Hex A activity can be measured in serum, white blood cells, or fetal trophoblastic cells, and is used as the initial screening test for TSD mutation carriers. However, in some cases, the enzyme test may not be diagnostic, and DNA analysis may be necessary to clarify ambiguous enzyme test results or to diagnose variant f orms of the disease. One review that included four studies and a retrospective analysis found that hexoaminidase A testing is accurate and impacts both pre and post -conception reproductive decision making. The review concludes that the evidence is sufficient to support the use of screening by Hex A enzyme testing individuals at high risk (Ashkenazi Jewish, French- Canadian or with positive family history) or partners of known carriers. It is also sufficient to support additional DNA analysis in individuals with ambiguous Hex A test results, suspected variant form of TSD or suspected pseudodeficiency of Hex A. The one guideline identified recommends that Hex A screening be offered to all pregnant Jewish patients if they or their partners have not yet been tes ted. Cystic Fibrosis Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease of the exocrine glands that is characterized by early onset of severe intestinal malabsorption, failure to thrive and recurrent chest infections and pneumonia which, if untreated, leads to death from malnutrition and respiratory failure in infancy or early childhood. The identification of the 5 Maternal age 35, suggestive US findings, history of prior trisomy pregnancy, positive aneuploidy screen or parental balanced robertsonian translocation with increased risk for fetal trisomy 13 or 21 Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 10 gene responsible for CF, CFTR, and its major mutations, allow for the identification of couples at risk who can be offered genetic counseling and prenatal CF diagnosis, and who can use the information to inform reproductive decision- making. Since heterozygotes are asymptomatic, carrier status assumes clinical significance only in the context of reproduction. A review of 10 population- based studies found carrier testing was 80% to 96% sensitive in Caucasians and 58% to 76% sensitive in Hispanics. Uptake rates for testing ranged from 68% to 95%. The evidence was sufficient to support the use of CF carrier screening if results will be used to guide decisions regarding childbearing or need for fetal diagnosis. A second review reported analytic sensitivity of 97.9% and analytic specificity of 99.4%, but clinical sensitivity of only 75%. Uptake rates in this review were reported as 85% to 100%, and of the affected fetuses identified, 83% were terminated. Four guidelines were identified, three of them addressing general prenatal care and offering differing recommendati ons. Two recommend that CF carrier screening be offered to all couples who desire it and have not been previously screened, while the third does not recommend screening. The one guideline that addressed CF carrier screening outside the context of general prenatal care recommends carrier testing in individuals and their partners with a positive family history, and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at 25% or greater risk of CF, and those with an echogenic bowel identified in the fetus. Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X Syndrome is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation, and results from a dynamic mutation (those that can change as they are passed down to future generations). In normal individuals there are six to 50 repeats of the CGG sequence of DN A at the Fragile X site. When the number of repeats ranges between 50 and 200, this is known as a premutation (PM); more than 200 repeats is considered a full mutation (FM). Full mutations inactivate the gene resulting in the Fragile X phenotype in all males (who only have one copy of the gene) and a proportion of females (all will be carriers, some will have the phenotype). A female with a PM or a FM may pass on a larger mutation than her own, resulting in offspring affected by Fragile X syndrome. Meanwhile, men with a PM may pass this onto their daughters, who will be of normal intellect, but may pass a larger mutation onto their offspring. The larger the size of the premutation repeat, the more likely is the expansion to a full mutation. A systematic rev iew that compared antenatal screening of low risk versus high risk women identified no studies, while a health technology assessment that compared different screening strategies for Fragile X syndrome found that population- based prenatal screening is more efficacious but significantly more costly than active cascade Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 11 screening6, with the incremental cost per Fragile X birth avoided being \u00a38494 for active cascade screening and \u00a3284,779 for population- based screening. Three guidelines address testing for Fragi le X and offer generally consistent recommendations. These include genetic counseling of all testing recipients, carrier screening of women with a positive personal or family history of fragile X -rated disorders, unexplained mental retardation or premature ovarian failure, and prenatal fetal DNA testing for known carriers. Heritable Thrombophilia Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, as are inherited thrombophilias. However, it is controversial whether there is an association between inherited thrombophilias and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as fetal loss, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and placental abruption. This possible association has resulted in increased screening for thrombophilias in pregnancy, although there has been no confirmation of treatment benefits. For heritable thrombophilia, one systematic review resulted in a recommendation to not screen for heritable thrombophilia in any group. One guideline was identified that addresses inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy. Regarding screening, it recommends against testing in women with recurrent fetal loss or placental abruption, and finds insufficient evidence to support testing in women with previous preeclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction. For women diagnosed with hereditary thrombophilia and/or with a history of thromboembolism, the guideline provides specific recommendations for which tests to perform, and for antepartum and postpartum management. Fetal Skeletal Dysplasia Skeletal dysplasias may present in the prenatal period when demonstrated by abnormalities on ultrasound. Differentiating these disorders in the prenatal period can be useful to distinguish known lethal disorders from nonlethal disorders and to assist with determining post -delivery management plans. One guideline was identified that provides specific recommendations for management based on abnormal findings of a second trimester ultrasound. Those recommendations include a determination of lethality based on ultrasound measurements, and molecular testing of pregnancies identified as at -risk for skeletal dysplasias. Spinal Muscular Atrophy Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseas e that results from degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons leading to atrophy of skeletal muscle and overall weakness. The incidence of SMA is approximately 1 in 6 Testing relatives of Fragile X patients to determine carrier status Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 12 10,000 live births, and it is reported to be the leading genetic cause of infant death, although milder forms allow survival into adulthood. Two guidelines were identified, with conflicting recommendations. One did not recommend screening for SMA in the general population, but did recommend carrier screening for those with a family history of SM A- like disease. The other recommends that carrier testing be offered to all couples. Ethnicities with Elevated Genetic Risk For ethnicities at increased genetic risk, two guidelines were identified with conflicting recommendations for screening those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Both recommend carrier screening for Tay -Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, and familial dysautonomia. One also recommends screening for Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, Mucolipidosis IV, Niemann- Pick type A and Gaucher disease type I, while the other only recommends that patient education materials be made available to patients concerning these conditions. Both groups also recommend carrier screening for Tay Sachs disease for individuals of French Canadian and Cajun origin. Genetic Counseling All three guidelines pertaining to microarray testing recommend that it be accompanied by genetic counseling. Guidelines addressing other specific genetic tests recommend genetic counseling be provided in the following situations: a positive cell free fetal DNA testing result, any cystic fibrosis carrier, women with risk factors for Fragile X or who request testing for Fragile X and women with a family history of, or who request testing for, spinal muscu lar atrophy. Evidence Summary Evidence- based guidelines for routine prenatal care are generally consistent regarding their recommendations related to genetic testing, recommending aneuploidy screening and screening options for hemoglobinopathies, cystic fibrosis, and structural abnormalities. Recommendations on specific tests were generally not based on trusted sources due to lack of availability of evidence and are derived from guidelines of variable quality. There are four options available for aneuploi dy testing in addition to the traditional method of karyotyping, which requires an invasive procedure (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling) and amniocyte culture. T hree of the four do not require the culture of amniocytes, allowing a more rapid turnaround time, but at the expense of a less accurate or complete diagnosis. They include QF -PCR, FISH testing and cell free fetal DNA testing. No evidence was identified for QF -PCR. The evidence for FISH suggests that it is a highly accurate test for detection of most potentially harmful chromosomal abnormalities, although it is unable to detect 7% to 11% of chromosomal disorders that can be detected by karyotyping. Cell free DNA testing reduces the Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 13 number of invasive confirmatory procedures needed while improving the number of detected cases of trisomy 21, compared to standard screening procedures , in high -risk populations of pregnant women. The fourth method, array CGH testing, is limited by difficulty determining whether a copy number imbalance is likely to be causative or benign, as well as the inability to detect balanced rearrangements. Evidence suggests that array CGH detects approximately 5% additional genomic imbalances when conventional karyotyping is normal, if the indication for performing the s tudy is a structural malformation on ultrasound. None of the three identified guidelines recommend array CGH testing for pregnancies at low risk of chromosome abnormalities, but all recommend it when fetal structural abnormalities are identified. For Tay -Sachs disease, the evidence is sufficient to support the use of screening by Hex A enzyme testing for individuals at high risk (Ashkenazi Jewish, French- Canadian or with positive family history) or partners of known carriers. It is also sufficient to support additional DNA analysis in individuals with ambiguous Hex A test results, suspected variant form of TSD or suspected pseudodeficiency of Hex A. For cystic fibrosis, the evidence is sufficient to support the use of CF carrier screening if results will b e used to inform decisions regarding childbearing or need for fetal diagnosis. For Fragile X Syndrome, three guidelines recommend carrier screening of women with a positive personal or family history of Fragile X -rated disorders, unexplained mental retard ation or premature ovarian failure, and prenatal fetal DNA testing for known carriers. For heritable thrombophilia, evidence supports and one guideline recommends not screening for heritable thrombophilia in any group. For fetal skeletal dysplasia, one guideline recommends determining lethality based on ultrasound measurements and molecular testing of at -risk pregnancies. For spinal muscular atrophy, two guidelines had conflicting recommendations, with one recommending carrier screening to all couples and the other recommending only for those with a family history of SMA -like disease. For ethnicities at increased genetic risk, two guidelines recommend screening those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, and familial dysautonomia, but disagree about screening for four additional conditions. Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 14 GRADE -INFO RMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the steps involved in developing recommendations. There are four elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and quality of evidence, are derived from the evidence presented in this document, while estimated relative costs, values and preferences are assessments of the HERC members . Indication Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence Resource Allocation Values and preferences Coverage Recommendation Use a validated questionnaire to assess genetic risk in all pregnant women Likely beneficial without known risks Low Limited Limited variability Administration of a validated questionnaire to assess genetic risk is recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) Screen high -risk ethnic groups for hemoglobinopathies Likely beneficial, minimal risks High Limited Limited variability Screening high risk ethnic groups for hemoglobinopathies is recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) Aneuploidy screening in first or second trimester Likely beneficial, minimal risks Moderate Moderate Moderate variability Screening for aneuploidy with any of the four screening strategies (integrated, serum integrated, stepwise sequential, and contingency) is recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) Serum triple screen is not recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 15 Indication Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence Resource Allocation Values and preferences Coverage Recommendation Perform an US for structural anomaly screen at 18- 20 weeks Possibly beneficial, minimal risks Low Moderate Limited variability Ultrasound for structural anomalies between 18- 20 weeks gestation is recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) Offer CVS or amnio for + aneuploidy screen, maternal age > 34, fetal structural anomalies, + FH, elevated risk of neural tube defect or maternal request Mixed - Moderate benefit depending on patient preferences, small risk (pregnancy loss 1/300- 500) Mixed High High variability CVS and amniocentesis are recommended for coverage for a positive aneuploidy screen, maternal age >34, fetal structural anomalies, positive family history, elevated risk of neural tube defect, or maternal request (weak recommendation) Genetic counseling is recommended for coverage prior to CVS/amniocentesis (weak recommendation) Aneuplo idy testing with QF -PCR Similar risk to karyotyping, may be more beneficial when rapid turnaround is required None Moderate High variability Test not available in the US - no recommendation made Array CGH testing when karyotype normal and structural anomaly on US Similar risk to karyotyping, similar benefits (detection of more chromosomal anomalies, but also more anomalies of no clinical significance, resulting in increased maternal anxiety Low Moderate Limited variability (because anomalies already identified) Recommended for coverage when major fetal congenital anomalies apparent on imaging and karyotype is normal (weak recommendation) Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 16 Indication Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence Resource Allocation Values and preferences Coverage Recommendation Aneuploidy testing with FISH Similar risk to karyotyping, may be more beneficial when rapid turnaround is required Moderate High High variability (because use for pregnancy decision making only) Karyotyping is first line test. If a rapid turnaround (i.e. at 22w4d or beyond) is required for reproductive decision- making, FISH is recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) Cell free fetal DNA testing High level of accuracy (98% detection rate with false positive < 0.5%). Less risk than karyotyping but less information provided (current tests only identify trisomy 13, 18 and 21) None Moderate High Moderate variability (many women would choose a noninvasive highly accurate test) Cell free fetal DNA testing is not recommended for coverage in women with elevated risk (maternal age>34, family history or elevated risk based on screening) (weak strong recommendation) Screening for Tay -Sachs carrier status using Hex A in high risk populations7 Benefits exceed harms Moderate Low Limited variability (most would choose to terminate) Screening for Tay -Sachs carrier status in high risk populations is recommended for cov erage. First step is H ex A, and then additional DNA analysis in individuals with ambiguous Hex A test results, suspected variant form of TSD or suspected pseudodeficiency of Hex A (weak recommendation) 7 Ashkenazi Jewish, French Canadian and Cajun Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 17 Indication Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence Resource Allocation Values and preferences Coverage Recommendation Screening for CF carrier status Potential benefit, minimal harm Moderate Moderate Moderate variability Screening for cystic fibrosis status is recommended for coverage once in a lifetime (weak recommendation) Screening for fragile X carrier status in women with +FH or risk factors8 Small benefit, depending on values of parents, minimal harm Low Moderate Moderate variability Screening for fragile X status in patients with a personal or family history of fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome premature ovarian failure unexplained early onset intellectual disability fragile X intellectual disability unexplained autism through the pregnant woman's maternal line adult Screening for thrombophilia No definite benefit, possible harm if prophylactic treatment undertaken (bleeding risks from anticoagulation) Low Moderate (if treatment undertaken) Limited Screening for thrombophilia is not recommended for coverage for recurrent pregnancy loss or in the general population (weak recommendation) Fetal genetic analysis of fetuses at risk for fetal skeletal dysplas ia based on US Mixed - Moderate benefit depending on patient preferences, small risk Low Moderate (cascade of testing) Moderate variability No recommendation made 8 Personal or family history of fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome, unexplained mental retardation, autism or premature ovarian failure (before age 40) Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 18 Indication Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence Resource Allocation Values and preferences Coverage Recommendation Spinal muscular atrophy carrier screening Small benefit, depending on values of parents, minimal harm None Low Moderate variability Screening for spinal muscular atrophy is recommended for coverage once in a lifetime (weak recommendation) Screening of Ashkenazi Jewish population for specific genetic diseases Likely beneficial, minimal risks Low Moderate Moderate variability Screening is recommended for coverage for those of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, and familial dysautonomia (weak recommendation) Expanded carrier screening Components likely beneficial, however, there is a risk of cascade testing, clinically unimportant results None Moderate. There is a cascade of testing. However, compared to individual diagnostic tests, this type of testing is much less expensive High variability Coverage is recommended for expanded carrier screening only for those genetic conditions previously identified with enough evidence or guidelines to support a recommendation for coverage (weak recommendation) Coverage is not recommended for an unlimited variety of tests offered as part of expanded carrier screening (weak recommendation) Genetic counseling Beneficial in greater understanding of risks and benefits Moderate Cost of appointment may be balanced by optimizing appropriate test utilization Low v ariability (most women would choose to see a genetic counselor) Pretest genetic counsel ing is recommended for coverage prior to CVS, amniocentesis, Fragile X, microarray, and spinal muscular atrophy screening (weak recommendation) Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix A Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 19 POLICY LANDSCAPE There were no quality measures pertaining to prenatal genetic testing identified when searching the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse . COMMITTEE DELIBERATIONS -EBGS In its review of this topic at its meetings April 4, June 6 and September 7, 2013, EbGS reviewed the initial draft coverage guidance and made the following decisions (some decisions from early m eetings were later reversed; the final decisions are reflected here): Did not include coverage for CVS/Amniocentesis for the indication of 'on maternal request' as a weak recommendation. Made no recommendation on QF -PCR as the test is not available in the United States. Recommended coverage for genetic counseling for women with certain risk factors. In Array CGH testing when the karyotype is normal and there is a structural anomaly on ultrasound, the subcommittee decided to remove the recommendation for genetic counseling, as counseling would already have occurred before the CVS/amniocentesis. For Array CGH with stillbirth at >20 weeks gestation, the subcommittee decided to strike the recommendation, as none of the evidence reviewed supports its use in improving future pregnancy outcomes. Decided to recommend coverage for Cell Free Fetal DNA testing for high risk pregnancies based on new evidence from trusted sources which was submitted during public comment. Changed the recommendation for thrombophilia screening to clarify that it is not recommended for screening, or for women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. Recommended coverage for spinal muscular atrophy only once in a lifetime with pretest genetic counseling. Recommended coverage for carrier screening in the Ashkenazi Jewish population for only four conditions rather than eight. COMMITTEE DELIBERATIONS - VBBS VbBS discussed the draft coverage guidance at its meeting 10/10/2013, reviewing a guideline note based on the draft coverage guidance. The subcommittee asked staff to consult with experts to incorporate the correct procedure codes into the guideline note, and added wording to allow a broader, but less expensive, test panel for additional Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 20 testing specific to patients of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. However, with regard to expanded carrier screening, the subcommittee chose not to make a similar statement , as some test panels currently available include traits such as eye color, and could be clinically irrelevant or inappropriate. COMMITTEE DELIBERATIONS - HERC The Health Evidence Review Commission reviewed the draft coverage guidance on March 13, 2014. The commission modified the criteria for coverage of genetic counseling prior to CVS, amniocentesis, microarray testing, Fragile X and spinal muscular atrophy screening to include patients considering those tests. Coverage guidance is prepared by the Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC) , HERC staff, and subcommittee members. The evidence summary is prepared by the Center for Evidence- based Policy at Oregon Health & Science University (the Center).

GRADE Element Descriptions Element Description Balance between desirable and undesirable effects The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed\u2014 the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Against: The subcommittee is confident that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Weak recommendation In Favor: the su bcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Against: the s ubcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Quality of ev idence across studies for the treatment/outcome High = Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate = Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low = Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low = Any estimate of effect is very uncertain. Coverage Guidance: Prenatal Genetic Testing Approved 3/2014 with DRAFT corrections for November 13, 2014 HERC meeting 22 Appendix B.

Question source : DMAP, HERC staff Issue : 92015 (DETERMINATION OF REFRACTIVE STATE) is included on 55+ lines of the prioritized list. However, this service is intended to be used for the purpose of prescribing lenses/spectacles. While there is value and medical justification for an ophthalmological exam for medical conditions such as diabetes and MS, the medical conditions other than visual acuity disorders do not support the need for the determination of refractory state. The prioritized list has line 455 DISORDERS OF REFRACTION AND ACCOMODATION which includes 92015 . Despite the funded condition on line 455 for the treatment of disorders of refraction, the OHP benefit plan limits the coverage of lenses and spectacles as follows: Current OAR: 410-140-0140(4)(d)Visual services for the purpose of prescribing glasses/contact lenses, fitting fees, or glasses or contact lenses for: (A) Pregnant adult women are covered, and a complete examination and determination of refractive state is limited to once every 24 months; (B) Non-pregnant adults are not covered, except when the client: (i) Has a medical diagnoses of aphakia, pseudoaphakia, congenital aphakia, keratoconus; or (ii) Lacks the natural lenses of the eye due to surgical removal (e.g. cataract extraction) or congenital absence; or (iii) Has had a keratoplasty surgical procedure (e.g. corneal transplant) with limitations described in OAR 410-140-0160 Contact Lens Services and Supplies; and (iv) Is limited to one complete examination and determination of refractive state once every 24 months.

Question source : DMAP and HERC staff Issue : Coverage for services in OHP benefit plan is define by either prioritized funded or non-funded condition/ treatment pairs or non-prioritized conditions managed by DMAP Lists. HERC makes recommendations for placement of non- prioritized diagnosis codes into any one of the four DMAP Lists (Excluded, Exempt, Ancillary, Diagnostic Workup) . Historically, the DMAP lists have not been published, are poorly defined, and inconsistently utilized to the intent of the Oregon Administrative Rules. Those lists that include diagnosis codes have been revised in an effort to improve access to healthcare by making transparent the management of those diagnosis codes not included on the Prioritized List, provide more precise and useful information to providers about benefit coverage, and improve the accuracy of claims processing. Old DMAP groups: Excluded = never covered/ not eligible for exception Exempt = Always covered Ancillary = always covered when the CPT code is above the funded line (could not find any definition of an ancillary diagnosis code) Diagnostic Workup File = always paid when paired with procedure codes above the funded line The new DMAP lists replace the use of the Excluded, Exempt, and Ancillary lines for diagnosis codes and are defined as follows: 1. Condi tions Not Covered (never covered/no exceptions) - This list is for the diagnosis codes that are specifically excluded by Oregon Administrative Rule and not eligible to be reviewed for coverage; a. Infertility b. Cosmetic c. Unrelated to improving health status d. Participation in experimental/ research programs 2. Undefined (usually not covered but eligible for review) - This list includes diagnosis codes that are unspecified. Some unspecified diagnosis codes are appropriately placed on the Prioritized List. Some unspecified codes may be used for both covered and uncovered diagnoses and are not placed on the List; these codes are eligible for review and for coverage if a more definitive diagnosis is not known. This list includes diagnosis codes that are VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Diagnosis Codes on Current DMAP Excluded List Suggested for Placement on the Prioritized List DMAP Files - Excluded List, Issue #684 Page 2 a. not definitive enough to determine line placement and ranking of the condition on the Prioritized List, or b. other coding is available to more specifically define and support treatment. 3. Informational (not covered/informational only) - This list is for diagnosis codes that are not valid to determine reimbursement or benefit plan coverage and may include diagnosis codes that are a. External Causes of Mortality b. Personal/ Family History not relevant to covered preventative servic es c. Health status codes d. Health Care Encounter codes (non-specific or redundant) e. Not eligible as a primary diagnosis 4. Diagnostic Workup File (payable when paired with procedure codes) - Diagnosis codes included on this list are only reimbursable with non- prioritized procedure codes that are in the Diagnostic Procedure List. It is intended to allow for diagnostic services to more definitively diagnose a. Signs & symptoms b. Conditions requiring further evaluation to better define the primary diagnosis In reviewing these lists, DMAP and HERC staff have identified ICD- 9 diagnosis codes that can appropriately be placed on the Prioritized List. HERC Staff Recommendations : 1) Add the ICD- 9 diagnosis codes on the following spreadsheet to the indicated lines on the Prioritized List and advise DMAP to remove them from their current DMAP lists VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Code Code Descriptions Proposed Placement Notes 20604 Arthrocentesis, aspiration and/or injection, small joint or bursa (eg, fingers, toes); with ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting50 RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY POLYARTHROPATHIES 157 PYOGENIC ARTHRITIS 290 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE ALWAYS REQUIRING TREATMENT 306 GOUT 468 OSTEOARTHRITIS AND ALLIED DISORDERS 511 PERIPHERAL ENTHESOPATHIES 533 BENIGN NEOPLASM OF BONE AND ARTICULAR CARTILAGE INCLUDING OSTEOID OSTEOMAS; BENIGN NEOPLASM OF CONNECTIVE AND OTHER SOFT SYNOVITIS AND TENOSYNOVITIS See arthrocentesis document 20606 Arthrocentesis, intermediate joint or (eg, temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, wrist, elbow or ankle, olecranon bursa); with ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting50, 157, 290, 306, 468, 511, 533, 597 See arthrocentesis document 20611 Arthrocentesis, aspiration and/or injection, major joint or bursa (eg, shoulder, hip, knee, subacromial bursa); with ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting50, 157, 290, 306, 422, 468, 511, 533, 597 435 INTERNAL DERANGEMENT OF KNEE AND LIGAMENTOUS DISRUPTIONS OF THE KNEE, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT INJURY/IMPAIRMENTSee arthrocentesis document 20983 Ablation therapy for reduction or eradication of 1 or more bone tumors (eg, metastasis) including adjacent soft tissue when involved by tumor extension, percutaneous, including imaging guidance when performed; cryoablationNon-Covered List See Issues document 21811 Open treatment of rib fracture(s) with internal fixation, includes thoracoscopic visualization when performed, unilateral; 1-3 ribs112 FRACTURE OF RIBS AND STERNUM, OPEN 21812 Open treatment of rib fracture(s) with internal fixation, includes thoracoscopic visualization when performed, unilateral; 4-6 ribs112 FRACTURE OF RIBS AND STERNUM, OPEN 21813 Open treatment of rib fracture(s) with internal fixation, includes thoracoscopic visualization when performed, unilateral; 7 or more ribs112 FRACTURE OF RIBS AND STERNUM, OPEN 22510 Percutaneous vertebroplasty (bone biopsy included when performed), 1 vertebral body, unilateral or bilateral injection, inclusive of all imaging guidance; cervicothoracic484 CLOSED DISLOCATIONS/FRACTURES OF NON-CERVICAL (bone included when performed), 1 vertebral body,unilateral or bilateral injection;...) were on line 507 (became line 484).

Diagnostic List 81415-8141 7 1) Exome testing 2) The human exome comprises only 1 -2% of the whole genome, it is this portion that codes for proteins, and was thought to contain 85% of all pathogenic mutations causing Mendelian disorders. The exome can be sequenced in only 48 h at roughly a third of the cost, with far fewer data to store and analyse compared to whole genome testing 3) GAP comments: VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/142015 Genetic Testing CPT code review 2 a. May find other genetic mutations that do not address the specific reason for the tests (i.e. BRCA1 mutation, etc.); therefore, need careful genetic counseling prior to testing b. Used when there are multiple anomalies in a child, or when other specific testing has not found a diagnosis. 20-30% chance of finding a genetic cause for a syndrome or developmental delay in a population of children who already had non-revealing testing c. Cost is about $5000 for a test, may be cost effective rather than doing a series of single gene tests d. Recommended change to non-prenatal genetic testing guideline: \"A genetic counseling/geneticist visit is required prior to ordering test .\" e. From Cary Harding: Regarding 81417: If any validation of an exome result is necessary, that should be done by another method rather than repeating an exome analysis 4) OHP medical director feedback: a. My main concerns are these: it appears that there is a great likelihood of identifying lots of \"noise\" mutations\u2014 things that may or may not have anything to do with the actual problem at hand...many [of the] genetic syndromes don't have any specific treatments that improve their outcome, so it might not alter treatment. It is possible that health monitoring might be changed, because we are basically screening for any genetic mutation. Depending on whether a specific diagnosis is reached, prognosis may change; further testing of parents would probably be needed to answer questions regarding family risk. So an argument could be made that it meets guideline D1, although it really is not clear. b. I would need CLEAR documentation how the genetic consultant believes the testing will treat the member. I do get provider feedback with a confirmed diagnosis would allow health plan benefits for the member otherwise not received and this is a majority of our current requests. Our CCO rarely approves this request on the basis it appears to be an investigation and is not assisting on a treatment plan. c. Until mutations are better known and we know which ones truly would materially benefit treatment/outcome, I concur testing would be investigational and hence not be covered by OHP plan. There also is the ethics concern raised...of uncovering incidental mutations that may be alarming to members and/or their blood relatives with uncertainty in what it means and whether any prophylactic treatment is indicated. I recommend testing be focused based on strong scientific findings for which recommendations include well-reasoned consideration risks vs. benefits . 5) Other expert input (Alison Adams Martinez, Ph.D. , Geneticist Oklahoma Health Care Authority) a. The published policies of most private payers indicate that they do not cover WES. However, once you get past testing more than 2-3 whole genes, it actually becomes more cost effective to do the WES up front and prevent the parade of single-gene test requests. So, I felt that the literature/other policies would support VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/142015 Genetic Testing CPT code review 3 us if we wanted to take a hardline stance against covering WES, but at the same time we could justify covering it in cases where the member's clinical features would make them eligible for genetic testing of multiple genes ...we agreed that we would reim burse for WES in select cases...[but] if we got too many claims that we would have to revisit the decision and not cover it at all. So far, we have paid for maybe 10 WES claims over the past year. In all cases, they met the criteria outlined by the ACMG. We've paid between $5 -7K per WES claim 6) Evidence a. TEC 2013 i. Has an algorithm indicating when testing may be indicated ii. Diagnostic yield 10-50% iii. Concern for many mutations found that have no or unknown clinical significance or are unrelated to the reason for testing iv. Medical management decisions, including initiation of new treatment or discontinuing inappropriate treatment, may result for only a subset of those diagnosed. v. Reproductive decisions for parents considering an additional pregnancy may be informed by determining the mode of inheritance. vi. Appropriate use of exome sequencing requires considerable genetic, clinical, and genetic counseling expertise. 7) Other coverage policies a. Aetna 2014 i. Exome testing is experimental b. Anthem BCBS 2014 i. Diagnostic genetic testing using panels of genes (with or without next generation sequencing), including but not limited to whole genome and whole exome sequencing, is considered investigational and not medically necessary unless all components of the panel have been determined to be medically necessary based on the criteria above. . 8) Recommendations: a. 81415, 81416 (whole exome testing, sequence genome Diagnostic List b. 81417 (re-evaluation): Non-covered List i.

See recommended changes to the Non-Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline 81440, 81460, 81465 1) Mitochondrial genome testing 2) Mutations of mitochondrial DNA can lead to a number of illnesses including exercise intolerance and Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS). Some evidence suggests that they might be major contributors to the aging process and age-associated pathologies. Recently a mutation in mtDNA has been used to help diagnose prostate cancer in patients with negative prostate biopsy. 3) Evidence a. Falk 2010 , review of mitochondrial disease i. Recommends whole mitochondrial DNA genome sequencing when a strong suspicion exists based on the symptom constellation and family history. ii. Panel testing of approximately a dozen \"common\" mtDNA point mutations that cause well-characterized disorders ...has historical significance but current utility primarily in adults. Indeed, the high cost of such limited point mutation panel testing currently approximates that of sequencing the entire 16,569 basepair mitochondrial DNA genome...it is typically more cost-efficient and ultimately informative to complete whole mitochondrial DNA genome sequence analysis to evaluate individuals (particularly children) with strong maternal pedigrees iii. It is important to realize that mtDNA may harbor other genetic abnormalities that are not detectable by whole genome sequence analysis. 4) GAP comments: \" May avoid muscle biopsy or other diagnostic studies. \" Dr. Cary Harding, a metabolic specialist, thought this test was appropriate in certain clinical situations. He recommended putting in a guideline requiring a genetics or metabolic consult prior to ordering the test. 5) Recommendation : Diagnostic List a. See recommended changes to the Non-Prenatal Genetic Testing Guideline i. Requires genetic or metabolic consult prior to ordering test 81470, 81471 Issue Summaries 11/13/142015 Genetic Testing CPT code review 6 2) Refers to forms of intellectual disability which are specifically associated with X- linked recessive inheritance. As with most X-linked disorders, males are more heavily affected than females. Females with one affected X chro mosome and one normal X chromosome tend to have milder symptoms. Unlike many other types of intellectual disability, the genetics of these conditions are relatively well understood. It has been estimated there are ~200 genes involved in this syndrome; of these ~100 have been identified. X-linked intellectual disability accounts for ~16% of all cases of intellectual disability in males. 3) The panel testing would include multiple of these known genes 4) Similar code coverage: a. CPT 81243, 81244 (Fragile X genetic testing) is covered with the following notation i n the genetic testing guideline: i. \"for individuals with intellectual disability/developmental delay. Although the yield of Fragile X is 3.5-10%, this is included because of additional reproductive implications .\" 5) GAC input: do not cover.

Genetic/Familial testing services (CPT 81211-81217) for women with a personal history of breast, ovarian and other associated cancers and for men with breast cancer should be provided according to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. Genetic/Familial should be provided as defined by the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. Colorectal Screening. V.1.2013 (5/13/13). www.nccn.org. 2) Genetic counseling should precede genetic testing for hereditary cancer whenever possible . a) Pre and post-test genetic counseling should be covered when provided by a suitably trained health professional with expertise and experience in cancer genetics i) \"Suitably trained\" is defined as board certified or active candidate status from the American Board of Medical Genetics, American Board of Genetic Counseling, or Genetic Nursing Credentialing Commission. b) If timely pre-test genetic counseling is not possible for time-sensitive cases, appropriate genetic testing accompanied by pre- and post- test informed consent and post-test disclosure performed by a board-certified physician with experience in cancer genetics should be covered. i) Post-test genetic counseling should be performed as soon as is practical. 3) If the mutation in the family is known, only the test for that mutation is covered. For example, if a mutation for BRCA 1 has been identified in a family, a single site mutation analysis for that mutation is covered (CPT 81215), while a full sequence BRCA 1 and 2 (CPT 81211) analyses is not. There is one exception, for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with a known mutation in the family, the panel for Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA mutations is covered (CPT 812 12). 4) Costs for rush genetic testing for hereditary breast/ovarian and colon/endometrial cancer is not covered.

Covered for predictive testing ONLY when a first degree family member has treatable iron overload (eg, *S and *Z): The alpha-1-antitrypsin protein level should be the first line test for a suspected diagnosis of AAT deficiency in symptomatic individuals with unexplained liver disease or obstructive lung disease that is not asthma or in a middle age individual with unexplained dyspnea. Generic testing or the anpha-1 phenotype test is appropriate is the protein test is abnormal or borderline. The genetic test is appropriate for siblings of people with AAT deficiency regardless of the AAT protein test results. h) CPT 81415- 81417, exome testing: A genetic counseling/geneticist consultation is required prior to ordering test i) CPT 81430-81431, Hearing loss (eg, nonsyndromic genomic panel: Testing for mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 need to be done first and be negative in non-syndromic patients prior to panel testing. j) metabolic consultation is required prior to ordering test. 3) Do not cover a more expensive genetic test (generally one with a wider scope or more detailed testing) if a cheaper (smaller scope) test is available and has, in this clinical context, a substantially similar sensitivity. For example, do not cover CFTR gene sequencing as the first test in a person of Northern European Caucasian ancestry because the gene panels are less expensive and provide substantially similar sensitivity in that context. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Definition of High Risk for Breast Cancer Question: H ow should high risk of breast cancer be defined? Question source: Genetics Advisory Panel Issue: GN3 defines which patients are at high risk for breast cancer, and therefore eligible for prophylactic procedures such as mastectomy or oophorectomy. The specifications in GN3, and referred to in the non-prenatal genetic testing guideline, are based on USPSTF criteria in place at the tim e the guideline was created. In 2013, the USPSTF changed their criteria for defining high risk to a recommendation for using one of several screening tools (see below). The NCCN published their own criteria for defining high risk in their 2014 guideline Genetic/Familial High Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian. Both the revised USPSTF and NCCN risk groups vary from the current GN3 definition. Additionally, NCCN has published an extensive guideline regarding what procedures should be offered to women based on an algorithm of their risk, which includes genetics as well as multiple other factors. As staff reviewed this topic, it was identified that the current guideline inappropriately allows prophylactic mastectomy and other treatments based on criteria for further genetic testing, not treatment. The NCCN 2014 guideline regarding treatment of breast cancer contains this statement: Except as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast and Ovarian and the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction, prophylactic mastectomy of a breast contralateral to a known unilateral breast cancer is discouraged. Contralateral mastectomy is still recommended for consideration in cases of invasive lobular carcinoma. From the USPSTF 2014 recommendations for genetic testing for breast cancer: For women who have at least 1 family member with breast, ovarian, or other types of BRCA-related cancer, primary care providers may use 1 of several brief familial risk stratification tools to determine the need for in-depth genetic counseling. Although several risk tools are available, the tools evaluated by the USPSTF include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool, Manchester Scoring System, Referral Screening Tool, Pedigree Assessment Tool, and FHS-7. The Referral Screening Tool and FHS-7 are the simplest and quickest to administer. All of these tools seem to be clinically useful predictors of which women should be referred for genetic counseling due to increased risk for potentially harmful BRCA mutations (most sensitivity estimates were >85%), although some models have been evaluated in only 1 study. To determine which patients would benefit from BRCA risk assessment, primary care providers should not use general breast cancer risk assessment models (for example, the National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Risk Assessment Tool, which is based on the Gail model) because they are not designed to determine which women should receive genetic counseling or BRCA testing. In general, these tools elicit information about factors that are associated with increased likelihood of BRCA mutations. Family history factors associated with increased likelihood of potentially harmful BRCA mutations include breast cancer diagnosis before age 50 years, bilateral breast cancer, presence of breast and ovarian cancer, presence of breast cancer in 1 or more male family members, multiple cases of breast cancer in the family, 1 or more family members with 2 primary types of BRCA-related cancer, and Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity. The USPSTF recognizes that each risk assessment tool has limitations and found insufficient comparative evidence to recommend one tool over another. The USPSTF also found insufficient evidence to support a specific risk threshold for referral for testing. Definition of who should be offered genetic testing for breast cancer syndrome rom the 2014 NCCN guideline for genetic testing for breast cancer: An unaffected individual with a family history of one or more of the following: -A known mutation in a breast cancer susceptibility gene within the family -2 breast primaries in single individual -2 individuals with breast primaries on the same side of family -1 ovarian cancer primary from the same side of family -First or second degree relative with breast can cer 45 y -1 family member on same side of family with a combination of breast cancer and 1 of the following: pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, brain tumors, cancer, leukemia/lymphoma; thyroid cancer, dermatologic manifestations and/or macrocephaly, hamartomatous polyps of GI tract; diffuse gastric cancer -male breast cancer Current guideline GUIDELINE NOTE 3, PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR PREVENTION OF BREAST CANCER IN HIGH RISK WOMEN Line 195 Bilateral prophylactic breast removal is included on Line 195 for women without a personal history of invasive breast cancer who are at high risk for breast cancer.

Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is included on Line 195 for women with a personal hist ory of breast cancer and any of the high risk categories listed above. In addition, contralateral prophylactic mastectomy of the unaffected breast is indicated for women with invasive lobular carcinoma. Prophylactic oophorectomy is included on Line 195 for women who have the BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Expert input: Dr. Andy Higgens, breast surgeon, Bend Growing trend nationwide to have contralateral mastectomy for decreasing patient anxiety and decreasing surveillance, despite lack of evidence of improved survival. Commercial insurers are not regulating contralateral mastectomy. The main benefit is peace of mind and symmetry, not medical survival or disease reduction. OHP will be an outlier if contralateral mastectomy is not covered by patient preference. Using risk groups to determine who should have contralateral mastectomy covered is problematic, as this is a rapidly developing area. Someone without a genetic abnormality or a 20% or greater risk of breast cancer would have contralateral mastectomy denied. This is not logical as this patient has more risk than the woman who has never had cancer but meets the NCCN requirement for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Recommends coverage for contralateral mastectomy unless medically contraindicated. Would remove the second paragraph of the proposed new guideline. Cost effective to do contralateral mastectomy in younger women given cost savings of avoiding years of mammograms and MRIs.

Question source : Katie Noah, Willamette Dental; DMAP Issue : Katie Noah noticed a discrepancy between DMAP rules and Guideline Note 62. Under the Dental Services Program Rulebook, 410- 123-1260, the rule shows that under 21 is 4 missing posterior teeth but over 21 is 6 missing posterior teeth for the benefit. http://www.dhs.state.or.us/policy/healthplan/guides/dental/123rb010112.pdf However, Guideline note 62 states that 4 or more posterior missing teeth per arch are required, not 6. On 1/1/2012, DMAP changed the coverage rules so adults age 21+ could only receive coverage of a partial dentures if they are missing 6 or more posterior or one or more anterior teeth. This was a benefit reduction and made coverage different for adults versus children. The guideline did not change at the same time. The rationale for this was: \"Limits on some dental services for adult clients (age 21 and older) due to reduced payments to managed Dental Care Organizations (DCOs) to comply with budget limitations required by the 2011 Legislative Assembly in SB 5529. This will help assure access to services through sufficient provider networks will be maintained following this approximate 11% reduction in capitation rates.\" Prioritized List Status: GUIDELINE NOTE 62, REMOVEABLE PROSTHODONTICS Line 477 Must have one or more anterior teeth missing or four or more posterior teeth missing per arch with resulting space equivalent to that loss demonstrating inability to masticate; third molars are not a consideration when counting missing teeth (D5211, D5212). Expert input: OHAP reviewed this guideline and felt that deletion of the guideline would provide the most clarity to the dental community. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Dentures Guideline and Rule Conflict Dentures , Issue #719 HERC recommendation: 1) VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Coverage of Tonsillar Hypertrophy Question : What is the HERC intent for coverage for tonsillar hypertrophy Question source : Lori Andrews, Referral Coordinator at Treasure Valley Pediatric Clinic in Ontario, Oregon Issue: Tonsillar hypertrophy [ICD-9 code 474.11 (Hypertrophy of tonsils alone)] is on two lines, one covered and one uncovered (lines 395 STREPTOCOCCAL SORE THROAT AND SCARLET FEVER; code 474.10 (Hypertrophy of tonsil with adenoids) only appears on the uncovered line only (line 574). The intention was to cover unilateral tonsillar hypertrophy, which is outlined in GN 36. However, this intent is not clear to health plans and other partners. The ICD-10 equivalent (J35.1) to 474.11 is also on both lines. From Ms. Andrews: I have a question about two very similar conditions on the prioritized list. ICD- 9 code 474.11 enlarged tonsils alone or tonsillar hypertrophy is a covered code. 474.10 enlarged tonsils and adenoids is below the line. When we make referrals to ENT as PCP, our providers are not able to determine if the adenoids are enlarged as only the tonsils are visualized, and we refer for dx code 474.11 which does not require an EOCCO referral #. ENT typically diagnoses 474.10, and then have to ask for a retroactive referral. Why is there such a difference between these two very similar codes? GUIDELINE NOTE 36, ADENOTONSILLECTOMY FOR INDICATIONS OTHER THAN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA Lines 49,84,395,574 Tonsillectomy/adenotonsillectomy is an appropriate treatment for patients with: A) Five documented attacks of strep tonsillitis in a year or 3 documented attacks of strep tonsillitis in each of two consecutive years where an attack is considered a positive culture/screen and where an appropriate course of antibiotic therapy has been completed; B) Peritonsillar abscess requiring surgical drainage; hypertrophy in adults; unilateral tonsillar hypertrophy in children with other symptoms suggestive of malignancy.

VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Hemangiomas Question : What changes should be made to the new hemangioma line and guideline? Question source: DMAP Hearings Division and HERC staff Issue : A new line for hemangiomas was created as part of the ICD-10 review. This change was made in response to the fact that the hemangioma ICD-9 code most often used was Ancillary, and intended for manual review to see if treatment was appropriate. The HERC decided to define when treatment should be undertaken by putting this code on the Prioritized List with a guideline note. This new line and guideline note will first appear on the January, 2015 Prioritized List. Recently, the DMAP Hearings Division received a request for coverage for treatment of a hemangioma diagnosis code (ICD -9 228.09) which is still present on the Ancillary List. HERC staff determined that this code was more appropriate for the Prioritized List and the equivalent ICD-10 code was on a line on this list. HERC staff also determined that further definition of when treatment of a hemangioma is NOT covered is required. January 1, 2015 Prioritized List : Line: 326 Condition: DERMATOLOGIC HEMANGIOMAS, COMPLICATED (See COMPLICATED Line 326 Hemangiomas are covered on this line when they are ulcerated, infected, recurrently hemorrhaging, or function-threatening (e.g. eyelid hemangioma).

Otherwise, they are included on line 636. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Intraocular Steroid Implants Question: what conditions should be paired with intraocular steroid implants? Question source: Allergan, Inc. Issue : Dexamethasone intravitreal implants (brand name Ozurdex) has recently been FDA approved for a new indication: the treatment of diabetic macular edema in patients who are pseudophakic or are phakic and scheduled for cataract surgery. Allergan Inc. is requesting that the HERC re-review coverage of dexamethasone intravitreal implants for this new indication. Psuedophakic refers to having an artificial lens in place in the eye (i.e. previously having had cataract removal surgery). Phakic and scheduled for cataract surgery refers to patients with cataracts severe enough to require surgery who are planning to undergo cataract removal surgery in the near future. These two groups ha ve been singled out as they do not suffer from one of the major adverse effects and increased costs of intraocular steroid implants, which is the formation of cataracts and the subsequent increased cost of cataract removal/lens implantation surgery. Previous studies have found that intraocular steroid implants are somewhat effective at treatment macular edema in the short term, but lead to long term complications (cataracts, glaucoma) which make the implants less effective and cost-effective than alternative treatments such as systemic steroid therapy. Current FDA approved indications for dexamethasone intravitreal implants: Retinal Vein Occlusion OZURDEX\u00ae (dexamethasone intravitreal corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) vein occlusion (CRVO). Posterior Segment OZURDEX\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye. Diabetic Macular Edema OZURDEX\u00ae is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema in patients who are pseudophakic or are phakic and scheduled for cataract surgery. At several VBBS and HERC meetings in 2013, dexamethasone intravitreal implants (Ozurdex) and fluocinolone intraocular implants (brand name Retisert) were reviewed for various indications. 1) Uveitis : P&T reviewed this indication in January, 2013 and concluded \"There is low quality evidence that there is no difference in visual acuity outcomes between fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant and standard of care with systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis. There is also low quality evidence that fluocinolone intravitreal implant may control inflammation in the eye faster and more frequently than standard of care, although both approaches decrease inflammation.\" These treatments were added to the line 106 DIABETIC AND OTHER RETINOPATHY with a guideline specifying that they appeared on this line for pairing with uveitis which was \"chronic, non -infectious, and affecting the posterior segment of the eye, and there has been appropriate trial and failure, or intolerance of therapy, with local and systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents.\" Line 106 is due to split into 3 lines in January, 2015. The CPT codes will only be included on line 363 VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14CHORIORETINAL INFLAMMAT ION for the ICD-10 List. HERC staff was also charged with finding more information on the effectiveness of treatment on intermediate uveitis, which is a non-FDA approved indication for implantable steroids . 2) Diabetic macular edema: P&T reviewed this indication in January, 2013 and found \"There is low quality evidence demonstrating potential benefit of fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant and dexamethasone implant for the treatment of diabetic macular edema, however significant complications have also been reported. There is insufficient evidence to support the use for diabetic macular edema or other off- label indications.\" Intravitreal steroid implants were not added as a treatment for diabetic macular edema. 3) Central retinal vein occlusion: P&T reviewed these treatments in January, 2013 and concluded \" There is moderate quality evidence demonstrating efficacy of dexamethasone intravitreal implant following central retinal vein occlusion .\" At the October, 2013 meeting VBBS/HERC added CPT 67028 only to line 445 VENOUS TRIBUTARY (BRANCH) OCCLUSION; CENTRAL RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION with a guideline specifying coverage was only for those individuals who have failed anti-VEGF therapy. 4) Branch retinal vein occlusion: This condition was not included in the P&T review conclusions. It was included in a NICE review that recommended coverage in certain limited situations. At the VBBS/HERC meetings, the commission felt that there was not enough evidence presented to make a decision on coverage, and HERC staff was directed to search for more evidence of effectiveness of intravitreal steroids for this condition. 5) Other conditions: the CPT code used for intravitreal steroid injections appears on line 387 CENTRAL SEROUS CHORIORETINOPATHY, but no evidence was found for use for intravitreal steroids for any condition on that line. A coding specification was added to line 387: \"CPT 67027 (Implantation of intravitreal drug delivery system) is included on this line for use with medications other than intraocular steroid implants.\" VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Current Prioritized List status: CPT of intravitreal drug system) and 67028 (Intravitreal injection of a pharmacologic agent) are found on lines 100 DIABETIC AND OTHER RETINOPATHY 284 RETINAL DETACHMENT AND OTHER RETINAL DISORDERS 290 COMPLICATIONS OF A PROCEDURE ALWAYS REQUIRING TREATMENT 323 PURULENT ENDOPHTHALMITIS 387 CENTRAL 453 DEGENERATION OF MACULA AND POSTERIOR POLE (67028 only) GUIDELINE NOTE 116, INTRAOCULAR STEROID IMPLANTS FOR CHRONIC NON- INFECTIOUS UVEITIS Line 100 Intraocular steroid implants (CPT 67027, 67028) are only included on Line 100 for with uveitis (ICD-9-CM codes 363.0x, 363.1x, 363.20 and 363.22), and only the following conditions are met: uveitis is chronic, non-infectious, and affecting the posterior segment of the eye, and there has been appropriate trial and failure, or intolerance of therapy, with local and systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents .

Conclusions: There is inadequate evidence for the use of intravitreal steroids for CRVO -ME due to a paucity of RCTs and well-designed observational studies on the topic; therefore, it is still an experimental procedure. 7) NICE 2011 , technology appraisal of dexamethasone implant for treatment of macular edema resulting from central retinal vein occlusion a. Dexamethasone intravitreal implant is recommended as an option for the treatment of macular oedema following central retinal vein occlusion. b. Dexamethasone intravitreal implant is recommended as an option for the treatment of macular oedema following branch retinal vein occlusion when: treatment with laser photocoagulation has not been beneficial, or treatment with laser photocoagulation is not considered suitable because of the extent of macular haemorrhage. c. Data analysis i. Dexamethasone for BRVO showed no difference in visual acuity compared to sham at 180 days, although there was significant improvement at earlier time points ii. Dexamethasone for BRVO was significantly better than sham only for those patients with previous treatment with laser coagulation 1. In the subgroup with BRVO and previous laser therapy 22.2% had an improvement in BCVA from baseline of at least 15 letters at day 30 compared with 2.8% in the sham group (p = 0.028). Differences between the dexamethasone and sham groups were also statistically significant at days 60 (p < 0.001), 90 (p = 0.011) and 180 (p = 0.022). Summary 1) Uveitis : some benefit seen with steroid implants; however, systemic steroid therapy appears to be equally effective. High rates of complications seen, including cataracts and increased intraocular pressure. Studies did not differentiate between posterior, intermediate, and panuveitis. The treatment appears to have an equal level of effectiveness and side effects for these 3 conditions. 2) Macular edema : Short-term benefit seen for intraocular steroid implants, but at the cost of an exceedingly high rate of complications (near 100% rate of cataract surgery required, high rates of surgical intervention for increased intraocular pressure). NICE concluded therapy was only cost-effective in eyes which already had undergone cataract surgery to reduce this complication risk/cost. 3) Retinal vein occlusion : For central retinal vein occlusion, some benefit seen with intraocular steroid implants, but anti-VEGF therapy has better outcomes with fewer complications. For branch retinal vein occlusion, studies have found no long term benefit while significant complications were seen. NICE completed a subgroup analysis and found that patients with BRVO who had previously undergone laser grid therapy had a significant improvement in visual acuity with steroid implants compared to sham. CENTRAL SEROUS CHORIORETINOPATHY. However, this diagnosis is a type of uveitis which is more appropriate for another line with other uveitis diagnosis codes and treatments. The placement of pars planitis was reviewed in October, 2009. At that time, pars planitis was on line 672, SENSORY ORGAN CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY . Several community ophthalmologists asked the HSC to move this diagnosis from its very low, uncovered line, to a higher, covered line. This request was denied as a review found little need for treatment. In June, 2010, as part of the biennial review at that time, several ophthalmologists again requested that the placement of pars planitis, among several other diagnoses, be reviewed. The ophthalmologists provided evidence that there were effective treatments for pars planitis, and that treatment was necessary in many cases. During this review, a new line was created, entitled Central Serous Retinopathy. This line was originally supposed to contain a variety of unrelated ophthalmologic diagnoses which only required treatment in some cases. Central serous retinopathy, pars planitis, and hypotony were placed on this line with a guideline regarding when certain of these conditions, including pars planitis, should be treated. Initially, this line was scored to an unfunded position, but it was later moved into the funded region. On review, pars planitis is also known as intermediate uveitis or posterior cyclitis. Its treatments are much the same as posterior uveitis and panuveitis. HERC staff recommends moving from the central serous retinopathy line to the very similar priority chorioretinal inflammation line. Current guideline note: GUIDELINE NOTE 10, CENTRAL 387 Central serous chorioretinopathy (H35.71x) is included on this line only for treatment when the condition has been present for 3 months or longer. Posterior Cyclitis (H30.2x) should only be treated in patients with 20/40 or worse vision.

VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Percutaneous Interventions for Cervical Spine Pain 1 Question: How should the HTAS Coverage Guidance regarding percutaneous interventions for cervical spine pain be applied to the Prioritized List? Question source: Health Technology Assessment Subcommittee Issue: HTAS approved a new Coverage Guidance at their July, 2014 meeting. This CG needs final approval by HERC at the January, 2015 meeting. The summary of the coverage guidance is shown below: HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE Therapeutic cervical spinal epidural injections are recommended for coverage for cervical spine pain with radiculopathy of six weeks duration ( weak recommendation ) only when all of the following criteria are met: documented neuroforaminal stenosis (without infection or neoplasia) radicular pain in a corresponding dermatomal distribution, pain is intractable and conservative therapy has failed, fluoroscopic guidance or CT guidance is utilized, interlaminar approach is utilized, no more than two injections without clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function, and maximum of three injections in six months. Epidural steroid injections of the cervical spine are not recommended for coverage (strong recommendation) for other types of neck pain or for headache. Therapeutic cervical intraarticular facet joint injections and therapeutic cervical medial branch blocks are not recommended for coverage for facet joint pain ( strong recommendation ). Facet joint radiofrequency neurotomy is recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) only when all the following criteria are met: at least 3 months of moderate to severe pain with functional impairment, pain is predominantly axial and not associated with radiculopathy, conservative therapy has failed, and complete or nearly complete pain relief (80% or greater) following fluoroscopically guided, low-volume local anesthetic blocks of the medial branch nerves, performed on two separate occasions using two commonly-used agents with different anticipated durations of action. This coverage guidance and HERC staff recommended changes to the Prioritized list were discussed at the August VBBS meeting. HERC staff recommended adding cervical epidural steroid injections to 4 spinal lines and facet joint injections to 3 spinal lines, both with new guidelines. After discussion, the VBBS decision was to continue to exclude these procedures. The major concerns of the VBBS were increase in costs if these procedures were covered, and the weak level of evidence supporting the HTAS recommendation to include these procedures. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Percutaneous Interventions for Cervical Spine Pain 2 HTAS relied on expert testimony and desire to provide options to surgery in recommending coverage. The epidural steroid injections are currently ancillary, whereas the facet joint injections are excluded. The VBBS requested clarification about the level of evidence needed to move a procedure from the ancillary list to the prioritized list. Based on the presumption that procedures on the ancillary list should only not be covered if evidence of harm or ineffectiveness was found, the VBBS decided to cover epidural steroid injections. However, due to the low level of evidence, the VBBS decided to not cover facet joint injections. Later in the meeting, however, the decision was regarding epidural steroid injections was reopened and the general decision was that HERC staff needed to obtain clarification on the level of evidence required to add something to the Prioritized List when it is on the Ancillary List. The decisions on both procedures were tabled until the November VBBS meeting. At the August HERC meeting, HERC members clarified the level of evidence required to add a previously ancillary procedure to the prioritized list. The HERC felt that ancillary list procedures were unlikely to have been reviewed in the past and should be subject to the same level of evidence requirements to be added to the prioritized list. In other words, Ancillary procedures needed to have good evidence of effectiveness to be added to the prioritized list. The HTAS summary of evidence is shown in the table below. The procedures in question had very low to low level of evidence of effectiveness. Expert input: Dr. David Sibell, OHSU Comprehensive Pain Clinic I've always found it interesting to see what different authorities view as evidenc e based medicine, when it comes to low back pain. My understanding is that, for acute radiculopathy, there is good evidence that transforaminal epidural steroid injection reduces pain for 6-8 weeks (though it does not reliably affect rate of surgery, which has many other determinants); and that physical therapy and waiting are also effective. For chronic low back pain, there are repeated studies that demonstrate prolonged improvement in pain and function in patients diagnosed with painful facet arthropathy. The problem is that there are also some very poor quality studies in this literature, and reviewers often group those studies together, even though they use non- standard techniques. It turns out that, if you do the procedure wrong, it doesn't work well...go figure. How likely is it that this treatment would be considered? It makes the highest degree of difference for patients with chronic low back pain (combined with physical therapy, in almost all cases) of anything we do. PT & CBT also have a considerable evidence base, for both acute and chronic LBP. I'm glad that medications are getting another look. The evidence is poor for the most commonly used therapies, so there is a chance to do something better for patients.

VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14COVERAGE GUIDANCE: ABLATION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Question: should the EGBS Coverage Guidance regarding ablation for atrial fibrillation be applied to the Prioritized List? Question source: Evidence Based Guideline Subcommittee Issue: EGBS approved a new Coverage Guidance at their September, 2014 meeting. This CG needs final approval by HERC at the November, 2014 meeting. The summary of the coverage guidance is shown below. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE AV node ablation is recommended for coverage only in persons with inadequate ventricular rate control resulting in symptoms, left ventricular systolic dysfunction or substantial risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Coverage is recommended only when pharmacological therapy for rate control is ineffective or not tolerated (weak recommendation) Transcatheter pulmonary vein isolation is recommended for coverage for those who remain symptomatic from atrial fibrillation despite rate control medications and antiarrhythmic medications ( strong recommendation) Surgical ablation (pulmonary vein isolation or Maze procedure) for atrial fibrillation is recommended for coverage at the time of other cardiac surgery for patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control medications ( weak recommendation ). Evidence Summary Ablation of the AV node or bundle of His in patients with AF results in lower heart rate at 12 months than pharmacologic treatment (moderate SOE), although there is no difference in mortality or exercise capacity (low SOE). Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) results in a greater likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm at 12 months than pharmacologic treatment (high SOE); most of the evidence for this finding is in patients with AF who have failed at least one AAD. This procedure (PVI) also results in lower risk of hospitalization over 12 months (moderate SOE) and improved QOL (moderate SOE), but the evidence is insufficient to assess the impact of PVI on mortality. The surgical Maze procedure, when done at the time of other cardiac surgery, results in a higher likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm than not performing the Maze (moderate SOE). Similarly, PVI done at the time of other cardiac surgery results in a higher likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm than not performing PVI (high SOE), and no apparent difference in all- cause mortality or stroke (low SOE).

(weak recommendation) Studies show mixed clinical significance of a lower heart rate. In those with persistently uncontrolled heart rate despite AADs, AV node ablation is a reasonable alternative to prevent the negative consequence s of an uncontrolled rate such as MI, exacerbation of CHF or cardiomyopathy. Transcatheter PVI vs. AAD Better maintenance of SR, fewer hospitalizations, better QOL, possibly lower mortality High/Moderate, based on 1 to 8 fair to good quality studies, depending on the outcome High Moderate Transcatheter PVI is recommended for coverage when a rhythm control strategy is desired (strong recommendation) Transcatheter PVI produces superior clinical outcomes to antiarrhythmic drugs alone when a rhythm contro l strategy is pursued Maze procedure Better maintenance of SR; possible (nonsignificant) increase in mortality Moderate based on 1 good and six fair quality studies Moderate (concurrent with other cardiac surgery) Moderate The Maze procedure is recommended for coverage at the time of other cardiac surgery if the benefits of maintenance of sinus rhythm are thought to Maze may help maintain sinus rhythm but concerning nonsignificant increased risk of mortality VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Indication / Intervention Balance between desirable and undesirable effects Quality of evidence * Resource allocation Variability in values and preferences Coverage recommen dation Rationale outweigh the potential risk of increased mortality (weak recommendation) PVI done with other cardiac surgery Better maintenance of SR High based on 5 good and 3 fair quality studies Moderate (concurrent with other cardiac surgery) Low PVI is recommended for coverage (weak recommendation) PVI may help maintain sinus rhythm without significant additional risks VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14 Current Prioritized List status ICD-9 427.31 Atrial fibrillation is on line 350 CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS CPT code Code description Current lines Suggested lines 33250 Operative ablation of supraventricular arrhythmogenic focus or pathway (eg, Wolff -Parkinson -White, atrioventricular node re -entry), tract(s) and/or focus (foci);

VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14COVERAGE GUIDANCE: NUCLEAR CARDIAC IMAGING Question: How should the EBGS Coverage Guidance regarding nuclear cardiac imaging be applied to the Prioritized List? Question source: Evidence Based Guideline Subcommittee Issue: EBGS approved a new Coverage Guidance at their September, 2014 meeting. This CG needs final approval by HERC at the November, 2014 meeting. The summary of the coverage guidance is shown below. HERC COVERAGE GUIDANCE PET is not recommended for coverage for screening or diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) (strong recommendation). Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is not recommended for coverage for screening for CAD in asymptomatic patients (strong recommendation). SPECT is not recommended for coverage for diagnosis or risk stratification of CAD (strong recommendation) \u2014except in patients for whom stress imaging is required and stress ECHO is contraindicated, is unavailable or would provide suboptimal imaging*) *i.e. pre-existing cardiomyopathy, baseline regional wall motion abnormalities, left bundle branch block, paced rhythm, unsuitable acoustic windows due to body habitus, inability to utilize dobutamine in a setting where exercise is not possible or when the target workload is not achievable Evidence Summary In asymptomatic individuals at high risk of CAD, there is no evidence of benefit for SPECT screening compared to no screening. In symptomatic patients at low to intermediate risk of CAD , evidence is conflicting with regard to ability to predict mortality and cardiovascular events, with one study finding no difference between ETT and SPECT, and another finding that stress SPECT and stress ECHO were better predictors than ETT and rest ECHO. In symptomatic patients at high risk of CAD, evidence is conflicting regarding rates of revascularization in those who undergo ETT compared to SPECT. Prognostic value does not differ between stress ECHO and stress SPECT. In populations with mixed risk of CAD , stress SPECT, stress ECHO, stress CMR and angiography do not differ in subsequent death or patient reported adverse cardiac events. SPECT and ECHO have similar prognostic abilities, and those tests as well as cardiac MR result in similar proportions of referrals to angiography or change in medical management. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14With regard to diagnostic accuracy, SPECT and ECHO have similar sensitivity (83% to 87%) and specificity (64% to 77%), although some analyses suggest that ECHO may be slightly more sensitive and SPECT may be slightly more specific. Extracardiac findings (which may require additional evaluation) are identified rarely with SPECT, and significantly less frequently than CCTA. Comparative evidence on the risks of various testing strategies is very limited, with the only apparent difference being that exercise stress has lower rates of adverse events than pharmacologic stress. SPECT has the highest radiation exposure of any testing strategy at a range of 7 to 30 mSv. SPECT appears to perform similarly in men and women, Caucasians and African-Americans, normal weight and obese patients, those with and without diabetes and those with and without hypertension. Evidence is conflicting regarding the value of ETT compared to SPECT. One study suggests that direct referral to angiography is the most cost effective strategy, with SPECT and cardiac MR being of moderate cost, and ECHO being the most costly. Another analysis finds that SPECT has low value compared to no screening in an asymptomatic population and compared to ETT in a low- to-intermediate risk population, and has comparable value compared to ECHO in all other populations. The evidence pertaining to PET is insufficient to draw conclusions for any outcome.

As such, surgical codes for the treatment of sleep apnea in adults were removed from the higher sleep apnea line 210 as there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness. Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy codes were left on Line 210 for children alone. However, children with craniofacial anomalies may need these surgical procedures and the removal of these codes may cause significant challenge when trying to get procedures covered. From Anna Kuang, Craniofacial plastic surgeon at OHSU We have a significant subset of craniofacial patients who need jaw surgery (distraction or formal jaw surgery) as means to obviate need for tracheostomy and or improve airway. Mandibular osteotomies the only surgical option besides tracheostomy (T&As helpful for managing them post op). Commonly affected kids: Any kid with a craniofacial syndrome may have associated micrognathia and glossoptosis WITH or WITHOUT cleft palate. And they can have midface hypoplasia that need midface advancement or distraction also WITH or WITHOUT cleft palate. Kids with skeletal dysplasia have assoiciated micrognathia and glossoptosis Pierre Robin Sequence diagnosis micrognathia, or WITHOUT cleft obstruction, septum, and or hypoplastic noses and need opens septorhinoplasty and other nasal surgeries. Diagnosis of OSA in pediatric population in difficult (multiple sleep studies, airway evals, CT/MRI's, repeat visits, multiple disciplines) and time consuming. Once the diagnosis is made, we often have to proceed quickly with surgical intervention. Only a small percentage of kids have CPAP as an option due to age and age/diagnosis compliance issues. Delay in approval or surgical intervention procedures is associated with increased morbidity. GUIDELINE NOTE 27, TREATMENT OF SLEEP APNEA IN ADULTS Line 210 CPAP is covered initially when all of the following conditions are met: VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in children with craniofacial anomalies Treatment of OSA (sleep apnea) in children with craniofacial anomalies, Issue #780 Page 2 12 week 'trial' period to determine benefit. This period is covered if apnea - hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) is greater than or equal to 15 events per hour; or if between 5 and 14 events with additional symptoms including one or more of the following: o excessive daytime sleepiness defined as either an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score>10 or daytime sleepiness interfering with ADLs, that is not attributable to another modifiable sedating condition (e.g. narcotic dependence), or o documented hypertension, or o ischemic heart disease, or o history of stroke; Providers must provide education to patients and caregivers prior to use of CPAP machine to ensure proper use; and Positive diagnosis through polysomnogram (PSG) or Home Sleep Test (HST). CPAP coverage subsequent to the initial 12 weeks is based on documented patient tolerance, compliance, and clinical benefit. Compliance (adherence to therapy) is defined as use of CPAP for at least four hours per night on 70% of the nights during a consecutive 30 day period. Mandibular advancement devices (oral appliances) are covered for those for whom CPAP fails or is contraindicated. Surgery for sleep apnea in adults is not covered (due to lack of evidence of efficacy).

CPAP coverage subsequent to the initial 12 weeks is based on documented patient tolerance, compliance, and clinical benefit. Compliance (adherence to therapy) is defined as use of CPAP for at least four hours per night on 70% of the nights during a consecutive 30 day period. Mandibular advancement devices (oral appliances) are covered for those for whom CPAP fails or is contraindicated.

Question source: Tracy Muday, MD, OHP Medical Director Issue: From Dr. Muday: We have lots of requests for adenoidectomy alone for young kids, usually under 4, sometimes under 2. My understanding of why they are doing the adenoidectomy alone is related to the risk of adenotonsillectomy in the younger group, and they feel that the adenoidectomy alone is likely to improve the kid's symptoms. Truthfully, my 3 ENTs have a gestalt of kids that they feel need tubes or adenoidectomy. The diagnosis that they use for this adjusts itself depending on what is covered. When OME was above the line, all the tubes were done with a dx of OME. When OME went below the line, they started paying attention to who had recurrent AOM, and that became the diagnosis. When we put limits on adenoidectomy with tubes for OME, they started coding for OSA and sinusitis Adenoidectomy for chronic otitis media Adenoidectomy for treatment of chronic otitis media was extensively reviewed in 2012 and guideline revisions made to clarify when this procedure is appropriate. Adenoidectomy was reaffirmed as a treatment for possible children with chronic otitis media receiving their second set of tubes in the Chronic Otitis Media guideline. Adenoidectomy for chronic sinusitis Adenoidectomy for chronic sinusitis was last reviewed in 2008. Some evidence was found that younger children (younger than age 12) may benefit for adenoidectomy for chronic sinusitis, but overall the body of evidence was scanty. Adenoidectomy was added to the chronic sinusitis line based mainly on expert opinion. It was noted that \" If surgery is indicated, evidence shows that adenoidectomy should be performed before endoscopic sinus surgery (which is currently covered).\" Adenoidectomy was added to the chronic sinusitis line for children younger than age 12 (42830, 42835). Adenoidectomy for OSA The obstructive sleep apnea guideline (GN 118) was extensively reviewed in 2013, but adenoidectomy as a single procedure was not reviewed. Evidence presented during this review focused on adenotonsillectomy.

GUIDELINE NOTE 51, CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION Lines 317, 481 Antibiotic and other medication therapy (including antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids) are not indicated for children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) (without another appropriate diagnosis). Patients with specific higher risk conditions (including craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, and cleft palate, or documented speech and language delay) along with hearing loss and chronic otitis media with effusion are intended to be included on Line 317. Otherwise hearing loss associated with chronic otitis media with effusion (without those specific higher risk conditions) is only included on Line 481. For coverage to be considered on either Line 317 or Line 481, there should be a 3 to 6 month watchful waiting period after diagnosis of otitis media with effusion, and if documented hearing loss is greater than or equal to 25dB in the better hearing ear, tympanostomy surgery may be indicated, given short- but not long- term improvement in hearing. Formal audiometry is indicated for children with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer. Children with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss should have hearing testing upon diagnosis. Children with chronic OME who are not at risk for language delay (such as those with hearing loss <25dB in the better hearing ear) or developmental delay (should be reexamined at 3- to 6- month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. Adenoidectomy is not indicated at the time of first pressure equalization tube insertion. It may be indicated in children over 3 years who are having their second set of tubes.

Neither addressed surgery 1) van den Aardweg 2010 , Cochrane review of adenoidectomy for chronic nasal symptoms in children a) N=1 study with 76 subjects who underwent adenoidectomy for improvement in episodes of common colds b) The risk differences were non-significant, being 2% (95% CI -18% (95% CI -28% to 7%) after 12 and 24 months, respectively. c) Authors' conclusions: Current evidence regarding the effect of adenoidectomy on recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms or nasal obstruction alone is sparse, inconclusive and has a significant risk of bias. 2) Brietzke 2008, meta-analysis of adenoidectomy for treatment of pediatric rhinosinusitis a) N=9 studies (10-121 subjects) i) 6 cohort, 4 case-control b) All studies showed that sinusitis symptoms or outcomes improved in half or more patients after adenoidectomy. c) The summary estimate of the proportion of patients who significantly improved after adenoidectomy was 69.3% (95% CI = 56.8 \u201481.7%, p < 0.001). d) Conclusion: Adenoidectomy reduces caregiver reported symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis in a majority of pediatric patients. Given its simplicity, low risk profile, and apparent effectiveness, adenoidectomy should be considered first line therapy for medically refractory, uncomplicated pediatric rhinosinusitis.

Adenotonsillectomy is very effective in treating OSAS. Adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy alone may not be sufficient, because residual lymphoid tissue may contribute to persistent obstruction. Expert Input \u2014Adenoidectomy for OSA Derek Lam, MD, OHSU ENT I'll have to take some time to do a more thorough literature review so I can provide some evidence, but off the top of my head I can tell you that there are definitely patients, especially younger ones, say 12-24 months for whom adenoidectomy alone may absolutely be an appropriate procedure for OSA. Often this may be the primary source of obstruction when the tonsils are small, and there is far less morbidity related to an adenoidectomy than a T&A (less pain, less potential for bleeding, faster recovery). As such, I think it would be a mistake to removal OSA as an indication for adenoidectomy alone. Because that would effectively put ENTs like myself in the uncomfortable position of recommending a T&A in order to get surgery authorized when an adenoidectomy alone would potentially suffice in situations where patients are clearly obstructing and need to have surgery. Admittedly this is a relatively uncommon clinical scenario, but certainly not so uncommon as to warrant removing this as an indicated procedure for OSA. Dr. Ericka King, MD, OHSU ENT I agree with Derek that there is certainly a cohort for whom adenoidectomy alone is a reasonable surgical intervention. There is fairly limited data, but I was able to find one study that directly assessed the question: Shintani et al. Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol 1998; 44:51. In this study, they selected children with an AHI of >10. Those with minimal tonsillar hypertrophy underwent adenoidectomy alone, with n=13. In this group, 84.5% demonstrated improvement on postop sleep study (defined as reduction of AHI by at least 1/2, with SpO2 nadir >85%). In the same study, kids that underwent T&A interestingly only had a 75.4% rate of improvement. This is obviously a small study and limited, but one of the few out there. The risks and recovery associated with adenoidectomy alone are much lower than a tonsillectomy, and I feel it is a very reasonable and valuable intervention in selected young children (<3 yrs) with isolated adenoid hypertrophy and history/PSG suggestive of OSA. Expert Input \u2014adenoidectomy for chronic sinusitis Dr. Ericka King, MD, OHSU ENT I disagree that the evidence supporting adenoidectomy is poor; actually it's fairly robust. The role in CRS is likely to be due to biofilm formation/ functioning of the adenoid pad as a bacterial reservoir; there is excellent evidence for this that I don't have time to summarize right now. Clinically, adenoidectomy alone has been shown to result in significant improvement in many studies, which are variably powered. Here are a few: - Takahashi et al. Acta Otorhinolaryngol Belg 1997; 51:85. study at 78 aged 5-7 with sinusitis and COME; 45 underwent adenoidectomy alone, the other 33 were controls. They found an improvement in symptoms win 56% after adeniodectomy vs 24% of the control group. - Vanderberg et al. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1997; 123:675. This group looked at 48 kids with CRS, and found complete or near complete symptom resolution in 58%, VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Adenoidectomy 7 some improvement in 21%, and minimal/no improvement in 21% after adenoidectomy alone. - Ramadan et al. Laryngoscope 2004; 114:2103. The authors studied 202 children with chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis by clinical and CT criteria that failed extensive medical management. They were randomized to endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) + adeonidectomy, ESS alone, or adenoidectomy alone. These groups showed 87.%, 75%, and 52% improvement rates respectively, with children 6 years and under less likely to improve than older children (60% vs 84% overall). Maximal medical management generally consists of prolonged antibiotics (3-6 weeks depending on the paper), nasal steroids and saline irrigations. This is a very difficult regimen for many young children, particularly the topical therapies. Additionally, for very good reasons we are trying to avoid CT scanning, particularly in young children. Thus, especially for young kids, I feel it is very reasonable to start with an adenoidectomy instead of a trial of medical therapy. Summary : Evidence supports use of adenoidectomy for medically refractory chronic sinusitis in children. Based on limited evidence, adenoidectomy alone appears to be effective for treatment of OSA in children without tonsillar hypertrophy.

Removal of retained tympanostomy tubes requiring anesthesia (CPT code 69424) or as an office visit, is included on line 427 as a complication, pairing with 385.83/ H74.8xX. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Breastfeeding supplies and support 1 Question: Should the guideline on coverage of breastfeeding support and supplies be clarified? Question Source: Breastfeeding Coalition of Oregon Christine Seals, CCO Medical Director Helen Bellanca, Maternal Child Family Program Director, Health Share Issue summary: There are concerns about inadequate or inconsistent coverage of both breastpumps and lactation support among OHP recipients. The January 1, 2015 Prioritized List refers to the HRSA guidelines to be covered on Line 3. HRSA specifically requires costs for renting breastfeeding equipment and comprehensive lactation support to be covered. The federal ACA requires coverage of breast pumps for lactating mothers and lactation counseling support for commercial plans . Both WIC and OHP currently provide breastpumps. Sometimes OHP CCOs are providing pumps as first line, and sometimes mothers are being referred to WIC if they need pumps. There are also concerns that inadequate WIC penetration may mean that There is currently no OHP coverage of lactation visits outside of the immediate postpartum hospital stay where it is bundled within the delivery hospital stay. There are implementation concerns about paying for lactation consultants separately based on the fact that these are often nonlicensed providers. From WIC, Bonnie Ranno Staff in WIC are excited about the inclusion of lactation services on HERC's prioritized list. There is such good evidence that the provision of lactation support, counseling, and equipment can increase breastfeeding exclusivity and duration, which then translates to significant health care savings and improved health for mothers and children. Our WIC breastfeeding team has gathered some information to help guide your writing of the HERC Guideline on Lactation Services. Please see the following attached documents: Recommendations and evidence base for the provision of lactation services in Oregon, with references Examples of what other states are providing in regards to Medicaid coverage of lactation services You had also asked about whether WIC would be able to change their policies regarding the provision of breast pumps for women returning to work or school. While WIC's funding for breast pumps is uncertain from year to year, we have been able to provide pumps for a number of WIC participants, and expect that we will be able to continue to do so, especially with some shifting from hospital pumps to personal pumps. It appears unlikely, however, that WIC's guidelines for electric pump distribution w ill broaden to include women who are not exclusively breastfeeding or those who are only away from their babies for a few hours. Those mothers would still qualify for a manual pump, though. I will also attach a FAQs document re Oregon WIC's breast pump pro gram, which provides additional information. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Breastfeeding supplies and support 2 In closing, we just want to reiterate that the HERC guideline will help to correct a real problem. CCOs have experienced a lot of confusion about lactation coverage, and clear guidance is needed. Putting lactation services on the prioritized list will help Oregon to Correct the equity issues that exist across the state in regard to lactation services Save money by preventing current and future health problems of mothers and babies Implement evidence-based and best practices pertaining to breastfeeding Fulfill Oregon Medicaid's requirement of complying with the Affordable Care Act Prioritized List status (as of January 1, 2015) Line 3 Included on this line are the following preventive services: 1.

Health insurance plans must provide breastfeeding support, counseling, and equipment for the duration of breastfeeding. These services may be provided before and after you have your baby. These rules apply to Health Insurance Marketplace plans and all other health insurance plans, except for grandfathered plans. Coverage of breast pumps Your health insurance plan must cover the cost of a breast pump - and may offer to cover either a rental or a new one for you to keep. Your plan may provide guidance on whether the covered pump is manual or electric, how long the coverage of a rented pump lasts, and when they'll provide the pump (before or after you have the baby).

The HRSA, ACA, USPSTF, and many others recommend comprehensive support to encourage and sustain breastfeeding. 2) Pumping - There are situations in which pumping would allow for short term uptake (e.g. medical necessity) and long-term provision of exclusive breastfeeding (e.g. inability of mother to provide breastfeeding directly because of work or school). The Prioritized List indicates breast pumps should be covered by its reference to HRSA Guidelines. Major federal and national organizations universally recommend coverage. VbBS Issue Summaries 11/13/14Breastfeeding supplies and support 11 a. There is inconsistency across CCOs and DMAP about expectations for coverage of breast pumps by OHP versus WIC. Currently, WIC is interested in continuing to provide breastpumps for women returning to work or to school. 3) Lactation support - there is not coverage for lactation support aside from what is bundled into the hospital delivery stay 4) DMAP is actively revising their rules for breast pump coverage HERC Staff Recommendation: 1.

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE Clinical Background The following clinical background summary is extracted from the WA HTA report (2013, p. 2-3). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves the systemic administration of 100% oxygen while the patient is inside a treatment chamber under pressures > 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). Hyperbaric oxygen was introduced as a medical treatment more than 200 years ago and has been advocated as a treatment for a wide variety of conditions over the years. Despite a large body of published literature, it remains unclear as to the indications for which HBOT is most effective and safe. Among the indications for which questions still remain are diabetic non- healing wounds, including foot ulcers; other non-healing wounds, including skin and tissue grafts, thermal burns, and surgical wounds; refractory osteomyelitis; late radiation tissue injury (LRTI); brain palsy; headache and migraine; multiple sclerosis; and sensorineural hearing loss. Foot wounds are one of the most common complications of diabetes and are responsible for substantial morbidity. At any given time, lower extremity ulcers affect approximately 1 million diabetics. HBOT is used along with traditional systemic and topical therapies to promote diabetic wound healing. It is purported to reverse anaerobic infection, improve blood supply, and reduce ischemic nerve damage. Chronic wounds other than those related to diabetes include venous and pressure sores, with causes that are related to venous insufficiency, pressure, trauma, vascular disease, and immobilization. Although the causes of chronic Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 4 wounds vary, in all cases, at least one of the phases of wound healing is compromised. Surgical wounds present a medical problem if they are large in size, especially if bones and tendons are exposed and therefore are not amenable to primary closure. By increasing the oxygen tension in hypoxic wounds, HBOT is thought to restore the level of oxygenation required for compromised tissue to function efficiently. HBOT is also proposed as a means of prepari ng a base for skin grafts and flaps or preserving compromised grafts and flaps. Thermal burns are the third largest cause of accidental death, with 300,000 serious burns and 6000 fatalities occurring annually in the United States. HBOT for thermal burns is directed at enhancing host defenses, preserving marginally viable tissue, protecting the microvasculature, augmenting neovascularization, and promoting wound closure. Chronic osteomyelitis can develop when bacterial or fungal infection within bone deprives the bone of its blood supply, and the resulting ischemia causes bone tissue necrosis. It has been hypothesized that the additional oxygen delivered during HBOT may promote collagen synthesis and angiogenesis in patients with hypoxic osteomyelitic wounds. More than 1.4 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer each year, and approximately half of these patients receive radiation therapy as part of their management. Radiation side effects can be categorized as either acute or delayed (chronic) complications; the latter may develop months or years after radiation treatment and collectively are known as late radiation tissue injury (LRTI) or late radiation side effects. Although any tissue may be affected, late radiation tissue injury occurs most commonly in the head and neck, chest wall, breast, and pelvis, reflecting the anatomical areas most commonly irradiated. Chronic radiation damage is called osteoradionecrosis (ORN) when bone is damaged and soft tissue radionecrosis when muscle, skin, or internal organs have been damaged. Evidence continues to emerge as to the effectiveness of HBOT for the treatment of LRTI, including ORN. The use of HBOT for brain injuries is based on a theory that oxygen availability to these cells stimulates the cells to function normally, reactivating them metabolically or electrically. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) , accounts for more than 1.3 million emergency room visits, approximately 275,000 hospitalizations, and 52,000 deaths annually. Cerebral palsy is a neuromuscular disorder that arises in children due to damage of the developing brain. This disorder occurs in 0.1% to 0.5% of live births and is Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 5 characterized by impairments of muscle control, the senses, and perception. There is no known cure for cerebral palsy; the usefulness of HBOT for the treatment of cerebral palsy relates to the possibility of restoring function in portions of the brain that have suffered damage due to lack of oxygenation or other trauma. More than 45 million individuals in the United States suffer from chronic, recurring headaches . Approximately 90% of headaches are primary headaches, which do not arise from an underlying medical condition. Cluster headaches are quite rare and occur in only 0.1% of the population. Migraine headache affects more than 28 million individuals in the United States and more than 300 million individuals worldwide. The theory is that HBOT might favorably influence vascular headache resistant to conventional drug therapy. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a dem yelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that afflicts an estimated 400,000 individuals in the United States and more than 2.5 million worldwide. The use of HBOT as a treatment for MS was originally based on the demonstrated ability of HBOT to produce vasoconstriction with increased oxygen delivery and some anecdotal evidence of efficacy. For several years, there was a flurry of investigation into its effectiveness for the treatment of MS, which produced a number of randomized studies in the U K, U.S., and Europe. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL), or sudden deafness, is a rapid loss of hearing with onset over a period of less than 72 hours. The estimated incidence of SSHL ranges from 5 to 20 per 100,000 persons per year but may be as high as 300 per 100,000 persons per year. HBOT has been proposed for the treatment of SSHL, the rationale being that the hearing loss appears to be caused by a hypoxic event in the cochlear apparatus; therefore, HBOT may potentially reverse the oxygen deficit, increase oxygen pressures in the cochlea, and improve microcirculation. Proving the effectiveness of HBOT for SSHL is complicated given the fact that up to two thirds of SSHL cases resolve spontaneously . Bell's palsy is an acute unilateral facial weakness without an identifiable cause. It is often a ssociated with ear discomfort, noise sensitivity and decreased tear production. It is estimated that it affects one person in 60 during their lifetime . Corticosteroids improve rates of recovery, while antiviral agents do not. It is hypothesized that in Bell's palsy, hypoxic d egeneration of the facial nerve can be reduced and functional recovery can be improved with use of HBOT. Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 6 Fractures of bone are common and typically heal within three to six months (Bennett, 2012a). However, the fracture healing process may be impaired leading to delayed or non-union of the fractured bone . Non -union is considered present when there has been no evidence of healing after six months . Rates vary widely, but range from 5% to 10% of fractures . In cases where there is a strong possibility of a delayed or non- union, extra interventions to promote healing are often appropriate. HBOT has been proposed as one of those interventions. Malignant otitis externa is a potentially fatal infection of the external ear canal and surrounding soft tissue and bone (Phillips, 2013) . It may be complicated by involvement of cranial nerves, principally the facial nerves and the contents of the jugular foramen. It is an uncommon condition mainly found in the elderly or in diabetics. Traditionally the mainstay of treatm ent has been prolonged antibiotic therapy, repeated debridement of necrotic tissue and sometimes aggressive surgical management. Hyperbaric oxygen has been proposed as a beneficial adjunctive therapy . Carbon monoxide is a gas generated from incomplete combustion, and p oisoning with CO is an important cause of injury worldwide (Buckley, 2011). In the United States alone, there are an estimated 50,000 annual incidences of CO poisoning. There are two syndromes that can occur after acute CO poisoning, persistent and delayed neurologic sequelae. Standard treatment for CO poisoning includes removal from the site of exposure, administration of supplemental oxygen, and general supportive care. The elimination of carboxyhemoglobin is shortened significantly by the administration of 100% oxygen at atmospheric pressure . The administration of HBO T further hastens this process. Dementia is a condition characterized by loss of memory, confusion, problems with speech and comprehension, and changes in personality (Xiao, 2012). T he number of dementia cases is projected to reach 81 million by the year 2040. Vascular dementia , the second most common form of dementia, is not a single disease but a group of syndromes based on a variety of vascular conditions . There are no current effective treatments, and possible benefits of HBOT have been proposed. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading c ause of death in the world (Bennett, 2011) . Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is defined as unstable or persist ent angina with or without myocardial infarction (MI). A significant number of patients with acute MI will suffer major morbidity or mortality, despite interventions such as thrombolysis or angioplasty. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been proposed to improve outcomes following ACS. Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection usually caused by Clostridium perfringens bacteria (Leof, 2012). Infection of this type is a medical emergency and can cause m yonecrosis, Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 7 gas production and sepsis and, without immediate treatment, may progress to toxemia, shock and death. Treatment usually consists of wound debridement and excision and can frequently require amputa tion. HBOT therapy has also been frequently used. Technology Description The technology description is extracted from the WA HTA report (2013, p. 3 -4). HBOT involves the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures > 1 ATA, the atmospheric pressure at sea level. Administering oxygen at pressures greater than 1 ATA requires compression. This is achieved by placing the patient in an airtight chamber. The pressure is increased inside the chamber, and 100% oxygen is given for respiration, which delivers a greatly increased pressure of oxygen to the lungs, blood, and tissues. There are 2 types of chambers used for administering HBOT: a monoplace chamber for a single patient; or a multiplace chamber used for multiple patients and medical personnel. No standard protocol has been identified for administering HBOT. Costs for HBOT were reported in the WA HTA report for three different populations, public employees, Medicaid and labor and industry. Costs, average treatment days and the range of days of treatment are presented in the table below: Population Public Employee Medicaid Labor and Industry Average allowed amount per patient $27,710 $46,774 $9,526 Average days of treatment 29 23 20 Range of days of treatment 1-101 1-93 1-120 Evidence Review Effectiveness of HBOT The majority of the evidence presented in this document that pertains to HBOT comes from the trusted sources listed at the beginning of this document. However, for several conditions, evidence was determined by HTAS to be insufficient for the committee to recommend policy, therefore they requested that additional evidence provided by the assigned expert be incorporated into this document. Two such evidence sources were utilized. One was the book , Hyperbaric Oxygen Thera py Indications , published by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) in 2014. The other, Murad 2013, is a systematic review of the literature on HBOT for all outcomes. The authors included 17 Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 8 systematic reviews that included 44 RCTs and 131 observational studies, plus an additional 5 RCTs published after the dates of the SRs. The authors (three of whom are members of the GRADE working group) then rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE for all indications for which there was sufficient information, and compared that rating to an assessment using the American Heart Association (AHA) criteria that relies primarily on study type. This AHA evidence quality grading system is used by the UHMS, and in this framework, level A evidence is derived fro m multiple RCTs or meta - analyses, level B is derived from a single RCT or non- randomized studies, and level C is derived from expert opinion or case studies. When the evidence is from one of these two sources, it will be identified as such by italics. Diabetic Nonhealing Wounds, Including Foot Ulcers Moderate- quality evidence from three systematic reviews (1437 participants), including 16 peer -reviewed studies reporting on the effectiveness of HBOT for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, suggests that the addition of HBOT to standard wound care promotes wound healing and limb salvage in the short term (WA HTA, 2013) . The results are clinically meaningful, with pooled data from three studies suggesting that eight patients would need to be treated with HBOT as an adjunct to standard wound care for an additional one person to have complete wound healing. In addition, the findings from two studies ( one good quality, one fair quality) provide moderate quality evidence that the effectiveness of HBOT to heal remains significant at one- year follow - up. Incidence of healing and wound size reduction are clinically synonymous but are often measured as separate research outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of HBOT to reduce wound size but given that the evidence supports HBOT for improved incidence of healing, it is reasonable to assume that further study into the effectiveness of HBOT to reduce wound size would find similar benefits. There is low -quality evidence suggesting no benef it from HBOT on quality of life (QOL) measures. A NICE guideline on inpatient management of diabetic foot problems recommends that HBOT not be offered as a treatment unless part of a clinical trial (NICE, 2012). However, the evidence review that supports the guideline included six RCTs, and allowed authors to conclude that there was moderate evidence that HBOT resulted in fewer surgical interventions and low evidence that it resulted in fewer major amputations. On the other hand, there was moderate evidence that HBOT did not reduce the number of minor amputations, or improve complete wound healing at 4 to 6 weeks, and low evidence that it does not reduce ulcer surface area. A cost - effectiveness evaluation found that an incremental cost -effectiveness ratio of around 25,000. Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 9 Other Nonhealing Wounds, Including Skin and Tissue Grafts, Thermal Burns and Surgical Wounds Overall, there is limited low -quality evidence from 12 peer -reviewed studies, suggesting that HBOT may improve healing when employed as an adjunct treatment for venous ulcers, flaps and grafts, and surgical reconstruction (without grafts or flaps) (WA HTA, 2013). There is low confidence in the reported estimate of effects for these conditions and the reported benefits should be interpreted with caution . Venous Ulcers The evidence for venous wounds includes two small RCTs (total N=46) and one case series (n=35). One of the RCTs found a significant reduction in wound area after 6 weeks but no difference at 18 weeks, while the other found a 59% reduction in wound area in the HBOT group compared to a 26% increase in the control group after 30 days. UHMS 2014 notes the existence of one RCT evaluating HBOT for treatment of leg ulcers of undefined etiology, but go on to state: \"HBOT treatment is not indicated in the primary management of venous stasis ulcers of the lower extremities.\" Murad 2013 states that for venous ulcers, the quality of evidence is listed as class B using the AHA grading system. The authors report that for the outcome of the proportion of ulcers healed, the relative effect size is 5.00 (95% CI 0.28 to 90.18), and using GRADE, has low quality evidence; evidence from one RCT was downgraded for increased risk of bias and imprecision, and upgraded for a large treatment effect. Surgical Reconstruction without Flaps and Grafts For patients who have undergone surgical reconstruction without flaps or grafts, the evidence is limited to two poor quality prospective cohort studies ( N=84 ). One found improved healing in more HBOT patients (89% vs. 83%), while the other f ound significantly more patients suffered infection and breakdown in the control group (78% vs. 17%). This indication is not addressed in the UHMS 2014 book or by Murad 2013. Compromised Flaps and Grafts For graft and flap survival, the evidence includes three RCTs (2 poor quality, 1 unknown quality), four case series and one additional study of unknown design. Total N=425. One of the RCTs found significantly better graft survival at 7 days in the HBOT group, while another found no significant benefit when compared to heparin and dexamethasone. The third RCT found improved healing of compromised skin grafts, while the study of unknown design reported significantly greater delay in wound healing in the control group (55% vs. 11%). Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 10 UHMS 2014 reported on a large number of animal studies. With regard to studies in humans, the authors report that there are no fewer than 16 studies supporting the effectiveness of HBOT for threatened grafts, which include a range of study types from RCTs to animal research. The only RCT discussed in detail (Perrins 1967) was included in the WA HTA report and was rated poor quality; it found that grafts survived in 64% of the HBOT arm compared to 17% of control (p<0.01). The authors also reference one retrospective cohort study and 8 case series to support their assessment. They state: \"the use of HBOT for the salvage of compromised grafts and flaps should be considered as a class 1b intervention according to the American Heart Association Evidence -based Guidelines as it is both useful and effective based on evidence from a single randomized trial and non- randomized studies with the potential benefit far outweighing the risks.\" Murad 2013 states that for split skin grafting, the quality of evidence is listed as class B using the AH A grading system. The authors report that for the outcome of complete graft survival at day 7, the relative effect size is 3.5 (95% CI 1.35 to 9.11), and using GRADE, has low quality evidence; evidence from one RCT was downgraded for increased risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness, and upgraded for a large treatment effect. For flap grafting for limb skin defects, the quality of evidence is listed as class B using the AHA grading system. Murad et al. report that for the outcome of flap survival at day 7, the relative effect size is 1.18 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.35), and using GRADE, has low quality evidence; evidence from one RCT was downgraded for increased risk of bias and imprecision. In addition, there is insufficient evidence from one study to determi ne the effectiveness of HBOT for crush injuries, insufficient evidence (primarily due to mixed results) from two studies to determine if HBOT is effective for the treatment of thermal burns, and insufficient evidence from one study to determine the effecti veness of HBOT for the treatment of acute traumatic peripheral ischemia. Crush Injuries For crush injuries, the evidence is limited to one fair quality RCT of 36 patients, which found significantly more complete healing in the HBOT group, but no difference in time to healing, number of amputations or length of hospital stay. UHMS 2014 reports approximately 600 clinical cases of using HBOT for crush injuries, and of those, approximately 80% reported positive outcomes. Only one RCT is specifically discussed ( Bouachour 1996), which was included as the only RCT in the WA HTA review and rated fair quality. UHMS states that complete wound healing Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 11 occurred in 94% of the HBOT group compared to 33% of controls (p<0.01), and that there was a need for additional surgeries in 6% of the HBOT group compared to 33% of controls (p<0.05). The description of this study in the WA HTA report adds additional information: \"...significantly more complete healing among the HBOT group (94% complete healing) compared with controls (56% complete healing) (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.11- 2.61; NNT, 3), no significant difference with regard to mean time to healing among the HBOT group (50.2 days) versus controls (55.8 days) (MD, 5.6 days; 95% CI, -19 to 7.8), no significant difference with regard to the number of amputations among the HBOT group (0) versus controls (2) (RR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.01- 3.89), and no significant difference in mean length of hospital stay among the HBOT group (22.4 days) versus controls (22.9 days) (MD, - 5.0; 95% CI, - 9.96 to 8.96).\" Murad 2013 states that for crush injuries, the quality of evidence is listed as class B using the AHA grading system. The authors report that for the outcome of complete wound healing without necrosis requiring excision, the relative effect size is 1.70 (95% CI 1.11 to 2.61), and using GRADE, has low quality evidence; evidence from one RCT was downgraded for increased risk of bias and imprecision. Thermal Burns For patients with thermal burns, the evidence includes two fair quality RCTs (N=141). One found no significant difference in hospital length of stay, additional surgeries or mortality, while the other found better time to healing in the HBOT group (20 days vs. 44 days). Acute Traumatic Peripheral Ischemia For acute traumatic peripheral ischemia, the evidence is limited to one case series (n=23) that did not provide detailed data. Refractory Osteomyelitis Low-quality evidence from 23 primary data studies ( one fair quality nonrandomized controlled trial , one poor quality nonrandomized controlled trial , 21 case series ) suggests that HBOT may be effective as an adjunct treatment for refractory osteomyelitis but there is low confidence in the reported estimate of effects (WA HTA, 2013) . There is some evidence from the one small, fair -quality, nonrandomized trial that HBOT may reduce the rates of relapse infection (0% vs. 33%), but this is contradicted by the other nonrandomized trial, which found no significant difference in relapse rate (14% for HBOT, 7% for control) . The latter trial (n=28) also found no benefit from HBOT as an adjunct to surgery and antibiotics with regard to cure (79% cure for HBOT vs. Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 12 93% cure for control). Further good- quality studies are necessary to determine the effectiveness of HBOT for the treatment of refractory osteomyelitis. UHMS 2014 reports that the evidence pertaining to the use of HBOT for refractory osteomyelitis consists of 26 reports, three of which utilized some kind of comparison group, although none were RCTs. The authors recommend the use of HBOT either before or after surgical debridement, depending on location of the infection, rationalizing that: \"The overwhelming majority of available studies supported the use of HBOT as a beneficial adjunct in the management of refractory osteomyelitis .... Treatment success rates generally exceeded that found in the literature for \"standard of care\" therapy using antibiotics and debridement alone....\" Murad 2013 states that for refractory osteomyelitis, the quality of evidence is listed as class B using the AHA grading system. The authors report that for the outcome of infection cure, the relative effect size is 0.85 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.15), and using GRADE, has very low quality evidence; evidence from one prospective cohort study was downgraded for imprecision. Late Radiation Tissue Injury There is moderate- quality evidence from 35 primary data studies suggesting th at HBOT improves outcomes of late radiation tissue injury affecting bone and soft tissues (WA HTA, 2013) . There is no overall estimate of effect because of the heterogeneity between studies, but the evidence suggests that radiation -induced tissue and bone damage to the head and neck, anus, and rectum show consistent clinical improvement with HBOT. There is also moderate- quality evidence that HBOT reduces the risk of developing ORN following tooth extraction in a previously irradiated area. Brain Injury For TBI, moderate quality evidence consisted of seven studies that included 571 people (Bennett, 2012b). The results of two studies indicate use of HBOT results in a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of people with an unfavorable outcome one month after treatment using the Glasgow Outc ome Scale (GOS) ( RR for unfavorable outcome with HBOT 0.74,95% CI 0.61 to 0.88, P = 0.001). This five- point scale rates the outcome from one (dead) to five (good recovery); an 'unfavorable' outcome was considered as a score of one, two or three. Pooled data from final follow - up showed a significant reduction in the risk of dying when HBOT was used (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88, P = 0.003) and suggests we would have to treat seven patients to avoid one extra death (number needed to treat [NNT] 7, 95% CI 4 to 22, moderate quality evidence). The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) has a total of15 points, and two small trials reported a significant improvement in GCS for patients treated with HBOT Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 13 (mean difference [ MD] 2.68 points, 95%CI1.84 to 3.52, P < 0.0001), although these two trials showed considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 83%).The improvement of 2.68 points in GCS is difficult to interpret. This scale runs from three (deeply comatose and unresponsive) to 15 (fully conscious), and the clinical importance of an improvement of approximately three points will vary dramatically with the starting value (for example an improvement from 12 to 15 would represent an important clinical benefit, but an improvement from three to six would leave the patient with severe and highly dependent impairment). In general, the studies were small and carried a significant risk of bias. None described adequate randomization procedures or allocation concealment, and none of the patients or treating staff were blinded to treatment. Evidence from six poor or very -poor-quality primary data studies are insufficient to determine if HBOT is effective in improving health outcomes among patients with brain injuries other than TBI (WA HTA, 2013) . Cerebral Pals y There is insufficient evidence from six studies ( two RCTS and four observational studies) to determine the effectiveness of HBOT for the treatment of cerebral palsy (WA HTA, 2013) . Inconsistencies in the direction of the results, a paucity of studies, small sample sizes, differences in baseline characteristics, and the number of treatment sessions provided, all contributed to the low -quality grade assigned to motor function, which was considered the major outcome of interest. Fair - to poor-quality obser vational data suggests an improvement in motor function and other disease-specific subjective outcome measures among children receiving HBOT, but a fair -quality RCT found no additional benefit from HBOT among children receiving HBOT versus those receiving pressurized air. Multiple Sclerosis Moderate- quality evidence from nine trials suggests little effect of HBOT on outcomes related to MS (WA HTA, 2013). Two small, good- quality trials found modest benefits, while seven fair-quality trials found no benefit. Furthermore, the statis tical benefits observed in the two positive trials are unlikely to translate into clinically significant benefits for the patient. Of note, there were no RCTs found on this topic post 1990, and there appears to be little interest in further investigation into the use of HBOT for MS. Migraines and Cluster Headaches Low-quality evidence from three fair-quality RCTs suggest that 40 to 45 minutes of HBOT is effective in significantly relieving an acute migraine attack (WA HTA, 2013) . Just two patients need to be treated to obtain significant relief for one additional patient. There is no evidence that HBOT can prevent migraines, reduce the nausea and vomiting associated with migraines, or reduce the need for rescue medication, based on Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 14 two fair quality trials . There is insufficient evidence from two studies to determine the effectiveness of HBOT for preventing, relieving, or terminating cluster headaches . Sensorineural Hearing Loss Low-quality evidence (due to mixed results) from eight RCTs is inconclusive as to whether there is a benefit of HBOT for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss in the acute phase (WA HTA, 2013). A large systematic review suggests that HBOT is beneficial among patients who present within two weeks of onset of the disease; however, there is no evidence that the statistical benefit observed translates into a functional benefit, and the results from a recent RCT do not suggest benefit from HBOT . Moderate- quality evidence suggests that HBOT provides no added benefi t to patients presenting with chronic sensorineural hearing loss. Murad 2013 reports that for chronic idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (> 2 weeks after presentation), the quality of evidence is listed as class A using the AHA grading system. The authors report that for the outcome of any improvement in hearing, the relative effect size is 0.64 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.33), and using GRADE, has very low quality evidence; evidence from one RCT was downgraded for increased risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness. Delayed or Non- healing Fractures No studies met the inclusion criteria of the review that addressed this indication (Bennett, 2012a). Authors identified three ongoing RCTs. Three excluded RCTs either did not report fracture healing outcomes or had been abandoned. Bell's Palsy No RCTs met the inclusion criteria of the review that addressed this indication (Holland, 2012). One small RCT (n=79) that did not meet criteria because the outcome assessor was not blinded reported that patients treated with HBOT had facial function recovery more of ten than those treated with prednisone (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.53). Malignant Otitis E xterna No RCTs met the inclusion criteria of the review that addressed this indication (Phillips, 2013) . Carbon M onoxide Poisoning Seven RCTs of varying quality were identified; one was excluded because it did not evaluate clinical outcomes (Buckley, 2011) . Of the six remaining trials involving 1361 participants, two found a beneficial effect of HBO T for the reduction of neurologic sequelae at one month, while four others did not. One of these is an incomplete publication (an abstract of an interim analysis). Although pooled random effects meta - analysis does not suggest a significant benefit from HBOT (OR for neurological deficits 0.78, 95%CI 0.54 to 1.12), significant methodologic and statistical heterogeneity was Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 15 apparent among the trials, and this result should be interpreted cautiously. Moreover, design or analysis flaws were evident in all trials. Importantly, the conclusions of one positive trial may have been i nfluenced by failure to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing, while interpretation of the other positive trial is hampered by a high risk of bias introduced during the analysis including an apparent change in the primary outcome. Both were also stopped early 'for benefit', which is likely to have inflated the observed effect. In contrast three negative trials had low power to detect a benefit of HBO T due to exclusion of severely poisoned patients in two and very poor follow -up in the other. One trial that was said to be finished around eight years ago has not reported the final analysis in any forum. (Strength of evidence: very low) Murad 2013 reports that for carbon monoxide poisoning, the quality of evidence is listed as class A using the AHA grading system. The authors report that for the outcome of resolution of signs and symptoms at 4- 6 weeks, the relative effect size is 0.78 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.12), and using GRADE, has very low quality evidence. Evidence from multiple RCTs was downgraded for increased risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision. Vascular Dementia One study involving 64 patients was included in the review (Xiao, 2012) . It compared HBOT as an adjuvant to donepezil with donepezil alone. This one study was judged to be of poor methodological quality. Patients receiving HBOT plus donepezil had significantly better cognitive function than the donepezil only group after 12 weeks of treatment, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (WMD 3.50; 95% CI 0.91 to 6.09) or by Hasegawa's Dementia Rating Scale (HDS) (WMD 3.10; 95% CI 1.16 to 5.04). There were no deaths or withdrawals, and the study did not mention safety assessment at all. Global function, behavioral disturbance and activities of daily living were not investigated in the study. (Strength of evidence: very low) Acute Coronary Syndrome Six trials with 665 participants contributed to this review (Bennett, 2011). There was a significant decrease in the ris k of death with HBOT ( RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.92, P = 0.02). The extent of heart muscle damage was lower following HBOT, as shown by a lesser rise in muscle enzyme in the blood (mean difference (MD) 493 IU, P = 0.005) and a better LV ejection fraction (MD 5.5%, P = 0.001). There was evidence from individual trials of reductions in the risk of major adverse coronary events (MACE) (RR 0.12, P = 0.03); re- infarction (RR 0.28, P = 0.04) and dysrhythmias following HBOT (RR 0.59, P = 0.01) , and the time to relief of pain was reduced with HBOT (MD 353 minutes shorter, P < 0.00001). One trial suggested a significant incidence of claustrophobia in single occupancy chambers of 15% (RR of claustrophobia with HBOT 31.6, P = 0.02). The authors conclude: Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 16 For people with ACS, there is some evidence from small trials to suggest that HBOT is ass ociated with a reduction in the risk of death, the volume of damaged muscle, the risk of MACE and time to relief from ischemic pain. In view of the modest number of patients, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting, this result should be interpreted cautiousl y. The routine application of HBOT to these patients cannot be justified from this review . (p. 4) (Strength of evidence for risk of death: low) Gas G angrene Evidence pertaining to the use of HBOT for this indication is limited to four retrospective comparison studies and 13 case series (Leof, 2012) . All four of the retrospective comparison studies compared mortality rates between patients treated with HBO T and those receiving standard wound care. All four studies found that HBO T improved survival rates. One of the cohort studies included reported that amputation rates among survivors were lower for HBO T patients (18%) than for controls (75%). The significance of these findings was not reported. (Strength of evidence: low) Optimal Dose , Frequency and Duration of HBOT The available data from 13 studies provides insufficient evidence to determine the optimal treatment frequency , duration or dose for HBOT (WA HTA, 2013) . No studies reported on the optimal duration of treatment sessions; there were mixed results from subgroup analysis involving 8 studies looking at frequency; and significant heterogeneity means that there is low confidence in the available results from five studies that looked at dose. Harms of HBOT There is moderate evidence suggesting that harms associated with HBOT are generally mild and self -limiting (WA HTA, 2013) . The majority of reported harms include barotrauma, temporary visual disturbances, and, more rarely, oxygen toxicity. Occasional reports of seizures represent the most serious side effects. The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) of Australia reported an overall harms incidence rate of 6.3%; 17% incidence of general pain or discomfort during decompression; 4.8% incidence of ear pain; 1.5% incidence 0.9% changes; barotrauma; 0.34% incidence pain; and 0.1% incidence of claustrophobia. Notable indication- specific harms found in the literature include the following: Among patients with late radiation tissue injury, there were reports of ear pain (16% in a trial of 150 patients), transient myopia (3% in one study 8% in another), and confinement anxiety (1.7%). Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 17 Pooled data from two trials reported severe pulmonary complications (defined as either, rising oxygen requirements and infiltrates in chest x -ray or cyanosis and hyperpnoea so severe as to imply hyperoxic pneumonia\") among 13% of TBI patients receiving HBOT compared with none in the control groups (RR, 15.57; 95% CI, 2.11- 114.72). One study reported ear problems among 47% of children with cerebral palsy receiving HBOT versus 22% among controls (P significant but value not reported). Another study reported a 12% seizure rate and found that 35% of patients reported ear problems. Another reported that 8% of 50 children stopped treatment due to adverse events, including seizures, and one other study reported 1 seizure in an observational study of 230 patients. Among patients with MS, a 2011 Cochrane Collaboration review reported 77 patients (55%), across 4 trials, suffered temporary deterioration in visual acuity in the HBOT group versus 3 patients (2.3%) in the sham 24.87; 95% CI, 1.44- 428.5; NNT, 1; 95% CI, 1 -2). Six of the case series evaluating HBOT for gas gangrene reported on harms (total N= 337). Two deaths were attributed to HBOT treatment, and seizures occurred in 7% of patients. Among patients with TBI, two studies reported an incidence of 13% for significant pulmonary impairment in the HBOT group versus 0% in the non- HBOT group (P = 0.007). Differential Efficacy or Safety The evidence is insufficient to determine the differential effectiveness and safety of HBOT according to sex, race, ethnicity, disability, wound duration, or treatment setting (WA HTA, 2013) . There is evidence of very low quality suggesting that younger TBI patients may recover faster with HBOT than older patients. There is low quality evidence suggesting that radiation dose influences the effectiveness of HBOT to prevent ORN among head and neck cancer survivors. There is low quality evidence that transcutaneous oxygen measurement ( TCOM ) is a good predictor of response to HBOT when measured under hyperbaric conditions, and there is mixed evidence as the whether TCOM can predict response to HBOT by first measuring the response of a wound to normal air or to 100% oxygen breathed at sea level. There is insufficient evidence from poor -quality studies to determine the differential safety of HBOT across populations. Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 18 Costs of HBOT HBOT may be cost -effective under very specific assumptions of effectiveness and costs (WA HTA, 2013) . All included cost analyses found HBOT to be cost -effective or cost saving. However, the available economic evaluations were severely limited by sparse cost data and unreliable efficacy and cost estimates used to make model assumptions. Only one model was found to be robust during sensitivity analysis, making most estimates very unreliable. Overall, there is low -quality evidence to suggest that HBOT may be a cost -effective treatment under certain conditions, for certain populations and indications. Evidence Summary Moderate- quality evidence supports the addition of HBOT to standard wound care to promote short term wound healing and limb salvage among patients with diabetic foot ulcers with continued improvement at one year follow -up. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of HBOT on QOL or other health outcomes. There is also moderate- quality evidence suggesting that HBOT improves outcomes of late radiation tissue injury affecting bone and soft tissues. Moderate- quality evidence also suggests that HBOT reduces the risk of dying following TBI and may improve functional outcomes. There is limited low -quality evidence suggesting that HBOT may improve healing when employed as an adjunct treatment for venous ulcers, flaps and grafts, crush injuries, and surgical reconstruction (without grafts or flaps) but more study is needed to support the current evidence. Low -quality evidence (due t o mixed results) is inconclusive as to whether or not there is a benefit of HBOT for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss in the acute phase of the disease. HBOT may reduce the rates of relapse infection among patients with refractory osteomyelitis but further good- quality studies are necessary to confirm this finding (very low quality evidence) . Low-quality evidence suggests that 40- to 45 -minutes of HBOT is effective in significantly relieving an acute migraine attack , but there is no evidence that HBOT can prevent migraines, reduce the nausea and vomiting associated with migraines, or reduce the need for rescue medication. Low quality evidence suggests that HBOT may decrease the risk of death and other major adverse coronary events in patients with ACS, and may decrease the risk of death and amputation in patients with gas gangrene. Moderate- quality evidence suggests little benefit of H BOT for the treatment of MS. Low - quality evidence suggests no benefit of HBOT for preventing, relieving, or terminating cluster headaches. There is also no evidence that HBOT is beneficial among patients presenting with chronic sensorineural hearing loss. There is insufficient evidence, Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 19 primarily due to mixed results or an overall paucity of studies, to determine if HBOT is effective for the treatment of thermal burns, cerebral palsy, brain injuries other than TBI, delayed or non- union of fractures, bell's palsy, carbon monoxide poisoning, vascular dementia or malignant otitis externa. Overall, there is a low quality of evidence to suggest that HBOT may be a cost -effective treatment under certain conditions and for certain populations and indications, but current data are insufficient to determine the most cost -effective uses of the technol ogy. There is moderate- quality evidence from across studies that harms associated with HBOT are usually mild, self -limiting, and with most resolving after the termination of treatment. The most common harms include myopia, barotrauma, claustrophobia, and oxygen toxicity. Life- threatening adverse events are rare but do occur on occasion and can include seizures and death. Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 20 GRADE -INFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the steps involved in developing recommendations. There are four elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop the recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and quality of evidence, are derived from the evidence presented in this document, while estimated relative costs, values and preferences are assessments of the HERC members.

Against: The subcommittee is confident that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Against: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Quality or strength of evidence rating across studies for the treatment/outcome1 High : The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate : The subcommittee is moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with some limitations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. Low: The subcomm ittee's confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. Very low : The subcommittee has very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Typical sets of studies are nonrandomized studies with serious limitations or inconsistent results across studies. 1 Includes risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 27 Appendix B.

HERC Guidance Development Framework HERC Guidance Development Framework Principles This framework was developed to assist with the decision making process for the Oregon policy -making body, the HERC and its subcommittees. It is a general guide, and must be used in the context of clinical judgment. It is not possible to include all possible scenarios and factors that may influence a policy decision in a graphic format. While this framework provides a general structure, factors that may influence decisions that are not captured on the framework include but are not limited to the following: Estimate of the level of risk associated with the treatment, or any alternatives; Which alternatives the treatment should most appropriately be compared to; Whether there is a discrete and clear diagnosis; The definition of clinical significance for a particular treatment, and the expected margin of benefit compared to alternatives; The relative balance of benefit compared to harm; The degree of benefit compared to cost; e.g., if the benefit is small and the cost is large, the committee may make a decision different than the algorithm suggests; Specific indications and contrai ndications that may determine appropriateness; Expected values and preferences of patients.

Coverage Guidance: Indications for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy DRAFT for HERC Meeting Materials 11/13/ 2014 37 The use of HBO therapy is covered as adjunctive therapy only after there are no measurable signs of healing for at least 30- days of treatment with standard wound therapy and must be used in addition to standard wound care. Standard wound care in patients with diabetic wounds includes: assessment of a patient's vascular status and correction of any vascular problems in the affected limb if possible, optimization of nutritional status, optimization of glucose control, debridement by any means to remove devitalized tissue, maintenance of a clean, moist bed of granulation tissue with appropriate moist dressings, appropriate off -loading, and necessary treatment to resolve any infection that might be present. Failure to respond to standard wound care occurs when there are no measurable signs of healing for at least 30 consecutive days. Wounds must be evaluated at least every 30 days during administration of HBO therapy. Continued treatment with HBO therapy is not covered if measurable signs of healing have not been demonstrated within any 30- day period of treatment. B.

I understand that you are considering elimination of reimbursement for hyperbaric oxygen treatment of CO poisoning. I am writing to tell you that I believe that would be a mistake. Thank you for taking the time to comment. 2 Last year, I served as the Clinical Expert for the State of Washington Health Technology Assessment of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. You may find it interesting that we did not even consider three commonly treated diagnoses where hyperbaric oxygen is considered proven, primary treatment -- decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, and CO poisoning. Thank you for providing this information, along with the transcript of the WA HTA meeting. 3 I understand that your group is going back and re -evaluating yet another time clinical studies that are now over a decade old. You will not find the answer in meta -analyses such as that done by the Cochrane Group or the American Society of Emergency Medicine. All clinical trials in the area have had some flaws, some more than others. They have all used different endpoints (some clinically irrelevant) and have had varying degrees of follow -up (some even using questionnaires self -administered by the patient at home when they would not return for re-evaluation). All have also used different protocols for treatment of hyperbaric and control patients (one hospitalizing control patients not rece iving hyperbaric treatment for three to six days of oxygen by mask, something that is not even done at their own institution or any other hospital in the world). There is no surprise that averaging six totally different studies yields no firm conclusions and the usual recommendation that \"more good quality studies are needed.\" Well, it has been over a decade since Weaver published his clinical trial as lead articl e in the New England Journal of Medicine. No trials randomizing hyperbaric oxygen with normobaric oxygen are underway at this time, to my knowledge. I would probably be aware of it if there were any. HTAS is aware of this controversy, and has elected not to mak e a recommendation regarding coverage or non -coverage of H BOT for CO poisoning. 4 In the meantime, what is a managing physician to do? When you get severe CO poisoning tonight because of malfunction of your furnace and are taken to the emergency department, the physician there may call a regional or national expert in hyperbaric medicine for advice. Do you want the expert to say, \"I don't know what to do because I am waiting for more high quality clinical trials to be performed and published\"? Of course not. You would want the expert's opinion based upon his or her synthesis of the data available. And that opinion might be to give hyper baric oxygen in selected cases. See comment #3 Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2014 Page 2 HERC Coverage Guidance - Indications For Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Disposition of Public Comments Ident. # Comment Disposition 5 The most common hyperbaric treatment performed for CO poisoning in the US is one treatment, followed by up to two additional treatments if the patient remains symptomatic. The treatment is typically done as an outpatient and the goal is prevention of chronic brain injury. The alternative is oxygen by mask in the emergency department until the patient's blood carbon monoxide level is normal and the patient is asymptomatic (usually 6 -12 hours). Thank you for this information. 6 The most similar experimental approach to this common practice was the study by We aver and that is why most experts in the field use it for guidance instead of meta -analyses that give no management recommendations and simply call for additional research. Weaver demonstrated that a practical hyperbaric protocol reduced the incidence of c hronic brain sequellae by 50% at one year, as compared to oxygen at sea level pressure. There were methodologic problems with the Weaver study, as noted in the coverage guidance. Because of this controversy, HTAS has removed any reference to this condition in the coverage recommendations. 7 I am sure that the cost of treating patients with CO poisoning with hyperbaric oxygen does not even show up on your state budget radar screen. Of an estimated 50,000 emergency department visits for CO poisoning in the US annually, only about 1,500 (3%) are treated with hyperbaric oxygen. The rest are treated in emergency departments (which may actually be more expensive in some situations, depending on the hospital's emergency department hourly c harge for occupancy of a room). My speculation is that you are talking about less than $20,000 annually for hyperbaric oxygen treatment of selected carbon monoxid e-poisoned patients in Oregon. Is your group willing to deny that and accept the responsibility that you are instead allowing you citizens to develop chronic brain injury because \"more well designed clinically studies are needed\"? I hope not . Thank you for this information See comment #3; HTAS is not recommending against coverage for CO poisoning. B 1 Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment regarding hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). This is a subject of considerable concern to the citizens of Oregon. Thank you for taking the time to comment. 2 Attached is a review published in the prestigious British Medical Journal regarding evidence based medicine and the effectiveness of the parachute. Although it was written as satire, it points out a crucial concept relevant to your current endeavor defining indications for HBOT. HTAS is aware of the parachute example, and in fact, it has been referenced by public commenters for a variety of previous topics that HTAS has considered. 3 Higher levels of evidence are based on large scale human Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT), which we believe reflects medical reality. But, as the BMJ article symbolizes, not everything in reality can be reduced to such large scale RCT's for many reasons, not the least of which is the ability to collect large control populations, with very similar characteristics, willing or ethically appropriate to forgo a recognized treatment in the name of science. That is to say, there are simply not sufficient numbers of people willing, nor should be selected, to jump out of an airplane without a parachute in order to prove the value of the parachute for those who do. That does not negate the effectiveness of the parachute. HTAS is aware of this and agrees that RCTs a re not always feasible. When they are not can be considered feasible is a matter of common sense to some, but a matter of opinion to others. Indeed, whether or not a clinical trial is reasonable is explicitly considered in the guidance development framewor k attached to every coverage guidance (see pages 30 -36). In the parachutes example, clearly no one would disagree with the feasibility of performing a RCT. Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2014 Page 3 HERC Coverage Guidance - Indications For Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Disposition of Public Comments Ident. # Comment Disposition 4 We have the same difficulty with HBOT. There is a paucity of level 1A evidence for HBOT, not for lack of interest or motivation, but due to the practical and ethical impediments to producing a good RCT. In the case of the diabetic foot ulcer, for example, how can we possibly find a large cohort stratified for consistency in diabetes control, medica tions required for that control, medical comorbidities, obesity, smoking history, arterial disease, degree of neuropathy, quality of footwear, access to medical care and socioeconomic factors, all of which directly impact the outcome of the wound as confounding variables. Rather than negate the value of lower levels of evidence, especially experimental studies which are at the bottom of the \"evidence pyramid\", this is an inherent, hidden detraction of higher levels of evidence, including an RCT. It is erro neous to equate a well -designed RCT in an animal model with \"poor\" evidence. HTAS is not entirely clear on the point that the commenter is making. We agree that stratifying a cohort based on a number of factors known to influence the outcome of procedure i s challenging, but can usually be accomplished statistically in the analysis. A well designed RCT in the animal model is not \"poor evidence\", but has limited applicability in humans. The second point I will try to make is the problem of consolidating t he entire spectrum of skin grafts and flaps into a single diagnostic category. There is a vast difference between a split thickness skin graft, a large, complex myocutaneous surgical flap, and a traumatic compromised tissue flap. It is erroneous to compare these as the same condition in assessing the effectiveness of HBOT for \"grafts and flaps\". It is here where the parachute problem becomes especially pertinent. In my experience treating patients with HBOT, one of the most urgent needs for this therapy is in a woman with breast reconstruction in which the nipple/areolar complex becomes compromised postoperatively. Hyperbaric oxygen is the treatment of choice as the nipple/areola becomes dusky, purple, dying and, I might add, physically and psychologicall y irreplaceable tissue. This is an emergency situation, but does not threaten life or limb. You will never see any RCT supporting the effectiveness of HBOT in this situation. The evidence will always be, at best, deductive and based on experimental models, low level \"poor\" evidence. But I can assure you that if this situation arises with you or a loved one, you ARE going to want HBOT and you are going to want it NOW. It would be erroneous for the State of Oregon to disallow, or even delay in any way, insura nce coverage of this crucial treatment of a potentially devastating disfigurement on the basis of lack of evidence that will never exist. Although considerably more rare, the same may be said of sudden blindness in acute central retinal artery occlusion, or deafness in acute sensorineural hearing loss. Carbon Monoxide poisoning is yet another example where human RCT studies will never exist. The coverage guidance document currently recommends coverage of HBOT for compromised flaps and grafts. Is the comment er suggesting that coverage NOT be recommended for some subset of flaps and grafts? If so, which subset is not defined. Central retinal artery occlusion is not addressed in this coverage guidance. See comments A3 -7 regarding CO poisoning. Regarding acute sensorineural hearing loss, the appointed expert provided additional information, referencing a 2012 Cochrane review and the AAO practice guideline. This information was reviewed by HTAS at their April meeting , and is repeated in comment #C4 . 5 I appreciate the due diligence being done by the Oregon Health Evidence Review Commission. I know you will read this with due consideration. I hope you will all enjoy the parachute Thank yo u for your comment.

C 1 Thank you for the opportunity to provide additional comments regarding the OHA technology assessment on hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In large part, I have no disagreement with the recommendations of the technology assessment. I appreciate all of the work that has gone into the review by the OHA, and I will make this as brief as possible. Thank you for your comment. 2 There are three indications for which the HERC assessment does not recommend hyperbaric medicine that are all in dications that have been reviewed and approved by the UHMS (thermal burns, refractory osteomyelitis, acute idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss). The current UHMS indications book uses AHA criteria and not GRADE methodology, so it is difficult to u se GRADE to argue for the use of HBOT. Dr. Murad's paper comparing the AHA criteria with GRADE is very informative, but has limitations in that it asks one single question and one single outcome for each hyperbaric indication. This limits the ability of a heterogenous body of literature to provide high quality, consistent answers for a single patient population. HTAS does not disagree regarding the use of GRADE in this instance. HTAS has incorporated the Murad review into this coverage guidance. 3 I am c urrently chair of the UHMS Clinical Practice Guideline Oversight Committee, and Dr. Murad is a member of the oversight committee as well. We are currently undertaking a more detailed review of all of the indications for HBOT using GRADE methodology, so we will shortly have a better ability to provide a more direct answer for these indications. My request would be for the HERC take these new publications under consideration (after they are published) in order to update their guidance documents. HTAS will be sure to review this additional information when this coverage guidance is updated. 4 Until then, please consider the comments regarding ISSHL that I have already been submitted to the committee. In brief, the Cochrane review on ISSHL did fi nd that there was a significant improvement in the decibel level of hearing gain, but questioned the clinical significance of that improvement. I have provided the WHO definitions for hearing loss, showing that there was a significant improvement from moderate and severe hearing loss to minimal hearing loss, which does not require the use of hearing aids. Additionally, the American Academy of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery recommends HBOT for ISSHL (CPG attached), as there are no other treatment o ptions that have had a similar improvement in hearing, which can be life -altering. The reference provided is a process document outlining the methods used by the AAO to develop their practice guidelines. The AAO practice guideline on ISSHL was previously s ubmitted by the commenter, and response was provided in another document (HBOT Supplemental Review: Additional Review of Evidence Provided by Public Commenter) and already reviewed by the committee. Commenter's previous statements regarding amount of heari ng improvement demonstrated in the Cochrane review, and WHO hearing loss definitions, are correct , and are repeated below for ease of consideration : \"for patients with severe hearing loss (61 -80 dB loss) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), the improvement was 37.7 dB. For patients with moderate hearing loss (41 -60 dB), the Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2014 Page 5 HERC Coverage Guidance - Indications For Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Disposition of Public Comments Ident. # Comment Disposition improvement in hearing was 19.3 dB. Using the WHO grades for hearing impairment, this represents a significant improvement from both of these categories to the slight hear ing loss (26 -40 dB) category (see attached slides courtesy of Heather Murphy- Lavoie, MD), which does not usually require a hearing aid. Considering that the costs of hearing aids are between $1500 -3000 per pair, need to be replaced every few years, and do not provide fully functional hearing, a limited course of HBOT ($2000 -5000 for a series of 10 sessions) may be a more cost effective and superior clinical result. \" The previous response to this comment is repeated below: The American Academy of Otolaryngology Clinical Practice Guideline (Stachler 2012) states the following with regard to use of HBOT for sudden hearing loss: \"Value judgments: Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is not widely available in the United States and is not recognized by many US clinicians as an intervention for ISSNHL, the panel felt that the level of evidence for hearing improvement, albeit modest and imprecise, was sufficient to promote greater awareness of HBOT as an intervention for ISSNHL.\" The authors of the g uideline reference the SR included in the WA HTA report (Bennett 2007), and in summarizing this review, state the following: \"Although the chance of a 50% improvement was not significantly increased following HBOT, the chance of a 25% increase was. Data in dicated that a physician would need to treat 5 patients with HBOT therapy to improve 1 person's hearing by 25%. Whether this is truly clinically significant is debatable.\" A literature search performed by the guideline authors identified one additional RCT published after the date of the SR which found no significant difference between HBOT and the control arm in the percentage of patients who regained hearing either Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2014 Page 6 HERC Coverage Guidance - Indications For Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Disposition of Public Comments Ident. # Comment Disposition moderately or completely. The authors conclude with the following: \"Given the small number of patients in the trials reviewed, methodological shortcomings, and poor reporting, the reported findings of benefit should be interpreted cautiously. The substantial cost, the potential adverse effects (including barotrauma), a question of the clinical s ignificance of reported benefits, and the confounding effect of cointerventions (steroids, antivirals, rheologic agents) make it difficult to weigh benefits and harms.\" Center for Evidence -based Policy June 2014 Page 7 HERC Coverage Guidance - Indications For Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Disposition of Public Comments References Provided by Commenters Commenter References A (1) Weaver, L.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for Surveillance for Breast Cancer Recurrence Following Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction https://www.hayesinc.com/subscribers/subscriberArticlePDF.pdf?articleId=16955 While the risk of locoregional recurrence is low after mastectomy, recurrences in residual breast tissue or the chest wall may be difficult to detect in a timely manner. Breast MRI is more sensitive than mammography for diagnosis of breast cancer; however, the rates o f false -positive findings on postoperative MRI images of the breast limit the clinical utility of this test in women who have undergone reconstruction. Because there are numerous surgical techniques for reconstruction after breast cancer, and various histo logical types of breast cancer, designing a clinical trial with adequate power to examine the usefulness of breast MRI for surveillance for recurrence in patient subgroups could be challenging. The use of breast MRI increases facility utilization and costs due to the need for contrast media and the possibility that the test findings will prompt additional testing including 1 HERC Coverage Guidance monitoring report August, 2014 MRI for breast cancer screening biopsy.

Screening Asymptomatic women with dense breasts and normal mammograms for breast cancer. Accessed on September 9, 2014 from http://www.bcbs.com/blueresources/tec/vols/28/28_15.pdf Author's Conclusions and Comment As with mammography in general, the decision on which imaging modality(s) to use hinges in part on the tradeoff between detecting cancers and performing a much higher number of unnecessary biopsies to detect those cancers. This topic is clearly subject to continued controversy, as the response to recommendations to potentially reduce the number of screening mammograms for asymptomatic women in their 40s has shown. A related, but probably less difficult, issue is how many screening tests women undergo. There are several areas where technologies are changing and where future studies may clarify the choices to be made. For example, ABUS performs faster and is less operator - dependent than handheld ultrasound. How the differences between ABUS and handheld US will translate into differences in health outcomes for women with dense breasts remain to be seen. Additional research on tomosynthesis may also be helpful. Given the variety of potential choices, careful studies of multiple modalities on the same women are useful. Because different types of imaging may be more or less accurate in detecting different types of breast cancer (e.g., invasive tumors versus ductal carcinoma in situ or larger [e.g., greater than 1 cm] or smaller tumors) or detecting it in women with different characteristics besides breast density (e.g., large versus small breasts), comparing the results of various types of breast imaging in different pop ulations cannot be addressed simply by adjusting for women's age, tumor stage, etc. There is also a trade -off between enhancing the number of expected cancers by, for example, selecting women with additional risk factors, versus testing these technologies in a true screening population likely to be encountered in clinical practice. Finally, the assumption that finding more cancers using additional techniques besides mammography produces better health outcomes on a population level will need to be verified. Women with dense breasts on mammography are at higher risk of breast cancer and of having any cancer missed by mammography. One possibility is to use additional imaging for women with dense breasts and normal mammograms. Both MRI and US have been 2 HERC Coverage Guidance monitoring report August, 2014 MRI for breast cancer screening suggeste d by different groups. Existing evidence on US suggests that adding it to mammography will increase the cancer yield while also increasing the number of recalls and unnecessary biopsies. One study showed that adding MRI to mammography and US increases the sensitivity while decreasing the specificity. Digital mammography is more sensitive than film mammography for women with dense breasts. Insufficient evidence is available on other modalities, such as tomosynthesis and automated breast ultrasound. NICE. ( 2013).

One addresses women with a personal history of breast cancer, another women with dense breasts and the third, women with a history of familial breast cancer. Because there are two sources that are currently being updated and likely apply to a broader population, it may be desirable to delay update of this guidance until those reports are available. 5 Topic: VISCOSUPPLEMENATION FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE Coverage Recommendation (Box Language): Viscosupplementation should not be covered for the treatment of pain associated with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

In the SRs identifying benefits, IAHA was noted to be most efficacious around eight weeks. Prolonged effects of IAHA were observed in studies that compared it to other active treatments, particularly intra- articular corticosteroid injections. In the SRs that observed no benefits of IAHA for knee OA, one highlighted a particularly large placebo effect which appeared to skew the IAHA effectiveness, while an other noted that probable industry bias swayed results in favour of IAHA. The other two SRs observed no clinical benefit; however, it was proposed that IAHA could be an alternative to non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs in older populations at risk for adverse events, due to its compar able favourable safety profile. Three of the identified guidelines do not recommend IAHA for the treatment of knee OA10 - and another does not include any conclusive recommendations. Of the four guidelines that recommend IAH A use for knee OA, one conditionally recommends IAHA for patients with inadequate response to initial therapy, another recommends IAHA use for moderate to severe knee OA (noting this was based on consensus only), and the other two guidelines provi de algorithms for IAHA use.

Annals -nine trials involving 12 667 adults met inclusion criteria. Sixty - eight had a sham control, 40 had a follow -up duration greater than 3 months, and 22 used cross- linked forms of hyaluronic add. Overall, 71 trials (9617 patients) sh owed that viscosupplementation moderately reduced pain (effect size, -0.37 [95% CI, - 0.46 to - 0.28]). There was important between- trial heterogeneity and an asymmetrical funnel plot: Trial size, blinded outcome assessment, and publication status were assoc iated with effect size. Five unpublished trials (1149 patients) showed an effect size of -0.03 (CI, -0.14 to 0.09). Eighteen large trials with blinded outcome assessment (5094 patients) showed a clinically irrelevant effect size of - 0.11 (CI, - 0.18 to - 0.04). Six trials (811 patients) showed that viscosupplementation increased, although not statistically significantly, the risk for flare -ups (relative risk, 1.51 [CI, 0.84 to 2.72]). Fourteen trials (3667 patients) showed that viscosupplementation increased the risk for serious adverse events (relative risk, 1.41 [CI, 1.02 to 1.97]). Limitations: Trial quality was generally low. Safety data were often not reported. Conclusion: In patients with knee osteoarthritis, viscosupplementation is associated with a small and clinically irrelevant benefit and an increased risk for serious adverse events. VADOD.(2014).

Topic: LUMBAR DISCOGRAPHY Coverage Recommendation (Box Language): Lumbar discography should not be a covered service for patients with low back pain and uncomplicated lumbar degenerative disc disease.

Spinal fusion and discography for chronic low back pain and uncomplicated lumbar degenerative disc disease. Olympia, WA: Health Technology Assessment Program. Retrieved from http://www.hta.hca.wa.gov/discography.html Scanning results: One review and one protocol were identified in the core sources that was published after the date of the WA HTA report. Summary results and/or conclusions are presented below: Hayes. (2010). Discography for Diagnosis of Low Back Pain. Accessed on September 9, 2014, from https://www.hayesinc.com/subscribers/subscriberArticlePDF.pdf?articleId=1893 Conclusions: The available evidence indicates that lumbar discography can result in high false - positive rates in identifying pain -producing discs, although pressure -controlled injection and strict classification of results can reduce the false -positive rate to 10%. When surgical outcome was used as the reference standard, some studies found a high degree of correlation between discography findings and degree of pain relief following surgery, while others failed to find any contribution of discography to surgical outcome. Inconsistencies among studies may relate to the variable results of these surgical approaches and/or to differences in disco graphy protocol. In the only study comparing discography with an alternate diagnostic approach, outcome after spinal fusion was worse in patients undergoing discography than in patients undergoing discoblock (intradiscal anesthesia) but the source of pain differed in the discography and discoblock groups. Therefore, available data do not clearly establish the efficacy of lumbar discography or the comparable value of lumbar discography relative to other methods in identifying the source of low back pain or determining surgical candidacy and do not clarify whether a positive discogram is sufficient to warrant surgery, particularly when using updated standards for defining positive discograms. Data do suggest that lumbar discography, as currently performed, is not commonly associated with serious adverse effects. Based on available data, the following Hayes Ratings are assigned: 1 HERC Coverage Guidance monitoring report August, 2014 Lumbar Discography C - For lumbar discography using pressure -controlled injection and updated criteria for positive discograms in patients with chronic s evere low back pain who are potential candidates for spinal surgery, when conservative care has failed, and other diagnostic tests have not clearly confirmed a suspected disc as the source of pain. D - For lumbar discography in patients who have a contrain dication to the procedure. This Rating reflects concerns regarding the safety of this procedure in these patients. _____________________________________________________________________________ Chou, R., Qaseem , A., Snow, V., Casey, D., Cross, J.T., Jr., Shekelle, P., Owens, D.K.; Clinical Efficacy Assessment Subcommittee of the American College of Physicians; American College of Physicians; American Pain Society Low Back Pain Guidelines Panel.

Artificial Disc Replacement for Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease. Reviewed Dec 17, 2013. https://www.hayesinc.com/subscribers/subscriberArticlePDF.pdf?articleId=11387 Conclusions: Several moderate -size randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of artificial cervical discs with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) have been published. Evidence to date demonstrates that total disc replacement (TDR) is at least as effective as ACDF in improving signs and symptoms associated with degenerative disease and improving quality of life (QOL) 2 HERC Coverage Guidance monitoring report August, 2014 Artificial disk replacement for up to 2 years. The evidence also shows that total disc replacement (TDR) reduces the need for reoperation and reduces the incidence of dysphagia. Low -quality evidence suggests that TDR reduces the risk of new adjacent segment disease (ASD) but may have higher rates of intraoperative and perioperative complications. Reliable follow -up data for more than 3 years are lacking, which is an especially serious limitation regarding the evidence for the intended advantage of TDR (reduction in long- term ASD). Positive but sparse evidence suggests that bilevel TDR is less safe than single- level TDR, but a few studies with several limitations suggest that it is comparable to bilevel ACDF in safety and efficacy. Hayes Rating (based on 12 RCTs) : B - For single -level TDR for the treatment of cervical disc disease in patients who are candidates for ACDF and who do not have forms of degenerative disc disease, allergies, comorbidities, or concomitant treatments that are expected to interfere with successful arthroplasty. D2 - For TDR in patients with multilevel cervical disc disease who are candidates for ACDF. This Rating is based on positive but very sparse evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of TDR for the treatment of multilevel disease. Hayes. (2013). Lumbar Total Disc Replacement for Degenerative Disc Disease. https://www.hayesinc.com/ subscribers/subscriberArticlePDF.pdf?articleId=6963 Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that, compared with spinal fusion, lumbar total disc replacement (LTDR) for degenerative disc disease (DDD) using the ProDisc or Charit\u00e9 may lead to improved o utcomes lasting 5 years after surgery. However, the longer -term clinical outcome of LTDR is still unclear. The evidence from uncontrolled long -term studies suggests that potential degeneration of adjacent discs and facets and wear of the polyethylene part of the disc may occur and that, in some cases, revision surgery may be needed. Long -term follow -up results from randomized controlled studies are available from only 2 randomized trials, and it is, therefore, not known if the benefits of LTDR are maintained. Furthermore, patient selection criteria still need to be refined. Hayes Rating (based on 9 RCTs) : C For LTDR using the ProDisc or Inmotion (formerly Charit\u00e9) in patients with DDD who would otherwise undergo lumbar spinal fusion. This Rating is based on the evidence suggesting that these discs may lead to improved outcomes compared with spinal fusion, the concern about potential degeneration of adjacent discs and wear of the disc itself, and the potential need for revision surgery. D 2 - For LTDR using the Maverick, FlexiCore, or Kineflex discs in patients with DDD who would otherwise undergo lumbar spinal fusion. This Rating is based on the paucity of evidence for these types of artificial discs. 3 HERC Coverage Guidance monitoring report August, 2014 Artificial disk replacement Jacobs W, Van der Gaag NA, Tuschel A, de Kleuver M, Peu l W, Verbout AJ, Oner FC.

Moreover, these analyses only represent a highly selected population. The primary goal of prevention of adjacent level disease and facet joint degeneration by using total d isc replacement, as noted by the manufacturers and distributors, was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. Unfortunately, evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias, while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. Non -randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent, blinded outcome assessment, which was not the case in the excluded studies. Therefore, because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years, we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale, despite the fact that total disc replacement s eems to be effective in treating low-back pain in selected patients, and in the short term is at least equivalent to fusion surgery.\" NICE. (2009). Prosthetic intervertebral disc replacement in the safety and efficacy of prosthetic intervertebral disc replacement in the lumbar spine is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. NICE. (2010). Prosthetic intervertebral disc replacement in the efficacy of prosthetic intervertebral disc replacement in the cervical spine shows that this procedure is as least as efficacious as fusion in the short term and may result in a reduced need for revision surgery in the long term. The evidence raises no particular safety issues that are not already known in relation to fusion procedures. Therefore this procedure may be used provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent an d audit.\" 4 HERC Coverage Guidance monitoring report August, 2014 Artificial disk replacement Summary: The recently published evidence is conflicting, with two sources supporting the current coverage guidance recommendations for cervical artificial disc and one contradicting them. Similarly, one source supports the current coverage guidan ce recommendations for lumbar artificial disc and two sources contradict them.

Retriev ed from http://www.hca.wa.gov/hta/Documents/hip_final_report_100913.pdf Efficacy (2 year): There is MODERATE evidence from three small randomized controlled trials that hip resurfacing (HR) is similar to total hip arthroplasty ( THA - replacement ) with respect to short- term (<2 year) functional, quality of life, and activity outcome. Efficacy (>2 year): There are NO DATA available to assess efficacy beyond two -year follow -up. Effectiveness (Short- term, <5 years): There is LOW evidence from studies directly comparing HR with THA to suggest that short term (5 years) patient -reported outcomes, clinician -based outcomes, and pain are similar comparing HR and THA. Activity scores tend to be slightly higher (better) in HR patients. Effectiveness (Mid -term, 5 -10 years): There is INSUFFICIENT evidence from one cohort study to suggest that at an average of 5.9 years follow -up, patients treated with HR may have better quality of life and activity outcome scores, but similar functional scores, compared with those treated with THA. Revision (Short -term, 5 years): There is HIGH evidence from three large registry studies that short -term revision risks are higher in patients treated with HR compared with those treated with THA. At three years, there is between 20 -50% higher risk of revision among those receiving HR vs. THA. The absolute risk is 3% in the HR group and between 2- 3% in the THA group. At five years, the higher risk is between 30 -80% . The absolute risk ranges from 5 to 6% in the HR group and 1 to 4% in the THA group. Revision (Mid -term, 6 -10 years): There is HIGH evidence from three large registry studies that 7 and 10 -year revision risks are higher ranging from 40 -100% in patients receiving HR versus THA. The absolute risk at 7 years is between 6 -9% in the HR group and between 3 - 4% in the THA group. Revision (Long -term, 10+ years): There is LOW evidence from one registry study that 11 - year revision risks are higher in patients receiv ing HR (10%) versus THA (7%). Complications: There is HIGH evidence from up to 3 RCTs and up to 6 observational studies that femoral component loosening occurs 8 times more frequently in HR patients than in THA patients, 2.7% vs. 0.3% heterotopic ossification occurs nearly twice as often in HR patients compared with THA patients, 19.8% vs. 11.4%. dislocation occurs less frequently in HR vs. THA patients, 0.5% vs. 2.8%. There is MODERATE evidence that deep infection occurs less frequently in patie nts undergoing HR compared with THA, 0.4% vs. 1.8%. The risk of femoral neck fracture and avascular necrosis in HR patients is 2% and 1%, respectively. Metal Ion Safety: There are consistently higher median concentrations of the primary metal ions cobalt and chromium in the blood or hair of HR patients compared with non - MoM THA (MoP and ceramic) patients in 5 studies with up to 3 -year follow -up. High blood levels of cobalt and chromium are associated with poor outcomes (revision or poorly functioning hip) c ompared with low blood levels in patients receiving HR in 3 studies. Higher serum ion levels of cobalt and chromium are associated with pseudotumor formation following MoM HR and MoM THA in 3 studies. MoM hip prostheses (both HR and THA) are not associated with an increased risk of cancer compared with THA with other bearing surfaces in 3 registry studies. There is no negative impact on renal function across 6 studies evaluating patients following MoM HR or MoM THA. Revisions: There is INSUFFICIENT evidence from one small study reporting similar functional and quality of life outcomes comparing HR revision with THA revision at final follow -up (range, 2 -7 years). Subpopulations: There is HIGH evidence from a large registry study that the diagnosis of develop mental dysplasia (DD) modifies the rate of revision in HR and THA; those with DD receiving HR have significantly higher revision rates than those receiving THA or those with other diagnoses receiving HR or THA. There is HIGH evidence from a large registry study that gender modifies the rate of revision in HR and THA; females receiving HR have significantly higher revision rates than females receiving THA or males receiving HR or THA. Smaller femoral component head size results in significantly higher revision rates for those receiving HR while larger femoral component heads result in higher revision rates in those receiving THA. NICE. (2014). Total hip replacement and resurfacing arthroplasty for end- stage arthritis of the hip (review of technology appraisal guidance 2 and replacement and resurfacing arthroplasty are recommended as treatment options for people with end -stage arthritis of the hip only if the prostheses have rates (or projected rates) of revision of 5% or less at 10 years. Summary: The recently published evidence does not contradict the current coverage guidance recommendations. Topic: Management of Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion in Children Coverage Recommendation (Box Language): Antibiotic and other medication therapy (including antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal steroids) should not be covered for children with children with otitis media with effusion (OME) (without another appropriate diagnosis). There should be a 3 to 6 month watchful waiting period after diagnosis of otitis media with effusion, and if documented persistent hearing loss is greater than or equal to 25dB in the better hearing ear, referral for tympanstomy surgery may be covered, given short, but not long - term, improvement in hearing. Formal audiometry should be covered for children with chronic OME present for 3 months or longer. Children with language delay, learning problems, or significant hearing loss should have hearing testing covered initially upon diagnosis. Children with chronic OME who are not at risk for language or developmental delay should be reexamined at 3 - to 6- month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. Adenoidectomy should not be covered at the time of the first pressure equalization tube insertion. Patie nts with craniofacial anomalies, Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and patients with speech and language delay along with hearing loss should have coverage based on an individualized treatment plan.

Scanning results: Eight reviews were identified in the core sources that were published after the date of the MED report (some were updates of Cochrane review s included in the guidance document). Summary results and/or conclusions are presented below: Williamson, I. (2011). Otitis media with effusion in children. BMJ Clinical Evidence, 01(502), 1 - 30. Oral antibiotics, antihistamines plus oral decongestants, or mucolytics may be of no benefit in OME, and can cause adverse effects. Oral corticosteroids are unlikely to improve symptoms in OME, and can cause growth retardation. Intranasal corticosteroids are unlikely to be of benefit in children with bilateral otitis media with effusion. Ventilation tubes may improve short -term outcomes, but the clinical effect size is small. They may also increase the risk of tympanic membrane abnormalities. Ventilation tubes improve hearing for the first 2 years, but have no longe r-term benefit, and may not improve cognition or language development. Adenoidectomy may improve hearing when performed with tympanostomy, but the clinical relevance of the improvements is unclear. Combination treatment with ventilation tubes plus adenoide ctomy may be more effective than adenoidectomy otitis media in children. (2010). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 1. Art. No.: CD007810. DOI: 10. 1002/14651858.CD007810.pub2. Main results: Fourteen randomised controlled trials (2712 children) studying the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with otitis media were evaluated. Most of these trials were too heterogeneous to pool in a meta -analysis. Loss to follow up varied from 0% to 63% after two years. Adenoidectomy in combination with a unilateral tympanostomy tube has a beneficial effect on the resolution of OME (risk difference (RD) 22% (95% CI 12% to 32%) and to 39%) for the non -operated ear at six and 12 months, respectively (n = 3 trials)) and a very small (< 5 dB) effect on hearing, compared to a unilateral tympanostomy tube only. The results of studies of adenoidectomy with or without myringotomy versus non -surgical treatment or myringotomy only, and those of adenoidectomy in combination with bilateral tympanostomy tubes versus bilateral tympanostomy tubes only, also showed a small beneficial effect of adenoidectomy on the resolution of the effusion. The latter results coul d not be pooled due to large heterogeneity of the trials. The effects of adenoidectomy on changes of the tympanic membrane or cholesteatoma have not been studied. Authors' conclusions Our review shows a significant benefit of adenoidectomy as far as the re solution of middle ear effusion in children with OME is concerned. However, the benefit to hearing is small and the effects on changes in the tympanic membrane are unknown. The risks of operating should be weighed against these potential benefits. van Zon A, van der Heijden GJ, van Dongen TMA, Burton MJ, Schilder AGM. for otitis media with effusion in children. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 9. No.: CD009163. 10.1002/14651858.CD009163.pub2. Main results: We incl uded 23 studies (3027 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points of evaluation. Overall, we assessed the studies as generally being at low risk of bias. Our primary outcome was complete resolution of OME at two to three months. The differences (improvement) in the proportion of children having such resolution (risk difference (RD)) in the five individual included studies ranged from 1% (RD 0.01, 95% CI - 0.11 to 0.12; not significant) to 45% (RD 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.65). Results from these studies could not be pooled due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Pooled analysis of data for complete resolution at more than six months was possible, with an increase in resolution of 13% (RD 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.19). Pooled analysis was also possible for complete resolution at the end of treatment, with the following increases in resolution rates: 17% (RD 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24) for treatment for 10 days to two weeks, 34% (RD 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.50) for tre atment for four weeks, 32% (RD 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47) for treatment for three months, and 14% (RD 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.24) for treatment continuously for at least six months. We were unable to find evidence of a substantial improvement in hearing as a result of the use of antibiotics for otitis media with effusion; nor did we find an effect on the rate of ventilation tube insertion. We did not identify any trials that looked at speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Data on th e adverse effects of antibiotic treatment reported in six studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity. Increases in the occurrence of adverse events varied from 3% (RD 0.03, 95% CI - 0.01 to 0.07; not significant) to 33% (RD 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.44) in the individual studies. Authors' conclusions: The results of our review do not support the routine use of antibiotics for children up to 18 years with otitis media with effusion. The largest effects of antibiotics were seen in children treated con tinuously for four weeks and three months. Even when clear and relevant benefits of antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must be balanced against the potential adverse effects when making treatment decisions. Immediate adverse effects of antibiotics a re common and the emergence of bacterial resistance has been causally linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003423.pub3. Main results: Sixteen studies (1880 participants) were included in the review. No statistical or clinical benefit was found for any of the interventions or outcomes studied. However, treated study subjects experienced 11% more side effects than untreated subjects (number needed to treat to harm = 9). Authors' conclusions: The pooled data demonstrate no benefit and some harm from the use of antihistamines or decongestants alone or in combination in the management of OME, therefore we recommend against their use. Perera R, Glasziou PP, Heneghan CJ, McLellan J, Williamson I. for loss associated with otitis media with effusion. (2013). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 5. Art. No.: CD006285. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006285.pub2. Main results: Eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were predomi nantly assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. There was no evidence of selective reporting. Pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than one month, nor at more than one month. Similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure -tone audiometry and non- discrete audiometry. Pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite m easure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04). None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions. Authors' conclusions: All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow -up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Primary care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. Further research should also consider the duration of treatment, the long -term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life outcome measures for children and families. Browning GG, Rovers MM, Williamson I, Lous J, Burton MJ. Grommets (ventilation tubes) for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children. (2010). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 10. Art. No.: CD001801. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001801.pub3. Main results: We included 10 trials participants). Some trials randomised children (grommets versus no grommets), others ears (grommet one ear only). The severity of OME in children varied between trials. Only one 'by child' study (MRC: TARGET) had particularly stringent audiometric entry criteria. No trial was identified that used long -term grommets. Grommets were mainly beneficial in the first six months by which time natural resolution lead to improved hearing in the non -surgically treated children also. Only one high quality trial that randomised children (N = 211) reported results at three months; the mean hearing level was 12 dB better (95% CI 10 to 14 dB) in those treated with gromme ts as compared to the controls. Meta -analyses of three high quality trials (N = 523) showed a benefit of 4 dB (95% CI 2 to 6 dB) at six to nine months. At 12 and 18 months follow up no differences in mean hearing levels were found. Data from three trials that randomised ears (N = 230 ears) showed similar effects to the trials that randomised children. At four to six months mean hearing level was 10 dB better in the grommet ear (95% CI 5 to 16 dB), and at 7 to 12 months and 18 to 24 months was 6 dB (95% CI 2 to 10 dB) and 5 dB (95% CI 3 to 8 dB) dB better. No effect was found on language or speech development or for behaviour, cognitive or quality of life outcomes. Tympanosclerosis was seen in about a third of ears that received grommets. Otorrhoea was commo n in infants, but in older children (three to seven years) occurred in < 2% of grommet ears over two years of follow up. Authors' conclusions: In children with OME the effect of grommets on hearing, as measured by standard tests, appears small and dimini shes after six to nine months by which time natural resolution also leads to improved hearing in the non -surgically treated children. No effect was found on other child outcomes but data on these were sparse. No study has been performed in children with es tablished speech, language, learning or developmental problems so no conclusions can be made regarding treatment of such children. Simpson SA, Lewis R, van der Voort J, Butler CC. Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children. (2011). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 5. Art. No.: CD001935. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001935.pub3. Main results: We included 12 medium to high- quality studies with a total of 945 participants. No study documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. The follow - up period was generally limited, with only one study of intranasal steroid reporting outcome data beyond six months. There was no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of hearing loss associated with OME. Pooled data using a fixed -effect model for OME resolution at short -term follow up (< 1 month) showed a si gnificant effect of oral steroids compared to control (RR 4.48; 95% CI 1.52 to 13.23; Chi\u00b2 2.75, df = 2, P = 0.25; I\u00b2 = 27%). Oral steroids plus antibiotic also resulted in an improvement in OME resolution compared to placebo plus antibiotic at less than o ne month follow up, using a random - effects model (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.49; five trials, 409 children). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.01, I\u00b2 = 69%). There was no evidence of beneficial effect on OME resolution at greater than one month follow up with oral steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) or intranasal steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) at any follow -up period. There was also no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of symptoms. Authors' conclusions: While oral steroids, especially when used in combination with an oral antibiotic, lead to a quicker resolution of OME in the short term, there is no evidence of longer -term benefit and no evidence that they relieve symptoms of hearing loss. We found no evidence of benefit from treatment of OME with topical intranasal steroids, alone or in combination with an antibiotic, either at short or longer term follow up.

(Prepared by the RTI -UNC Evidence -based Practice Center under Contract No. 290- 2007 -I.) AHRQ Publication No. 13 -EHC091 MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Results: We identified 59 studies through the earlier reviews and our independent searches. Generally, studies examined interventions in otherwise healthy, non -infant children. We did not find any eligible studies covering complementary and alternative medicine. Findings are reported for clinical and functional outcomes, and harms. Variation in length of tympanostomy tube (TT) retention corresponded to whether TT were designed to be short versus long term, but variation in TT type was not related to improved OME and hearing outcomes. Tympanostomy tubes decreased OME for 2 years compared with watchful waiting (WW) or myringotomy, and improved hearing for 6 months compared with WW. OME resolution was more likely with adenoidectomy than no treatment at 12 months. Adenoidectomy and myringotomy were superior to myringotomy alone in relation to OME and hearing outcomes at 24 months. Adenoidectomy and TT were superior to WW for hearing outcomes at 24 months. Autoinflation was superior to standard treatment at improving OME at 1 month. We found no benefits from oral steroids at 2 months, or topical steroids at 9 months. In relation to functional outcomes, TT and WW did not differ in long -term language, cognitive or academic outcomes. Tympanosclerosis and otorrhea were more common in ears with TT. Adenoidectomy increased the risk of postsurgical hemorrhage. In one study of a subgroup, adults receiving autoinflation were more likely to recover from OME than those in the control group at one month. We found no studies examining the influence of any health care factors on treatment effectiveness. Conclusions: There is evidence that both TT and adenoidectomy reduce OME and improve hearing in the short term, but both treatments also have associated harms. Large, well- controlled studies could help resolve the risk -benefit ratio by measuring AOM recurrence, functional outcomes, quality of life measures, and long -term outcomes. Finally, additional re search is needed to support treatment decisions in subpopulations, particularly those with comorbidities and those who have received a pneumococcal vaccine inoculation. Summary: The recently published evidence does not contradict the current coverage guidance recommendations. Topic : INDICATIONS FOR PL ANNED CESAREAN SECTI ON Coverage Recommendation (Box Language): Planned cesarean section (CS) should be covered for: Breech presentation (if external cephalic version unsuccessful or contraindicated; and vaginal breech delivery is unavailable, undesired, or contraindicated) Partial or complete placenta previa Morbidly adherent placenta Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive mothers who are not receiving anti- retroviral therapy, are receiving anti- retroviral therapy and have a viral load of 400 copies per ml or more, or who are co -infected with Hepatitis C Primary herpes simplex virus infection in the third trimester Twin pregnancy (if the presenting twin is not vertex) Planned CS should not be covered for: Preter m birth Small for gestational age Suspected cephalopelvic disproportion Maternal Hepatitis B infection Maternal Hepatitis C infection Elective (without obstetrical or medical indication) For prior cesarean delivery and other conditions for which there is insufficient evidence* of clear benefit over harms, coverage may be based on an individualized treatment plan.

Two were published prior to 2010 and assessed as up to date without changes after 2010. Of the remaining five, two identified no RCTs, and hence were empty reviews. The other three addressed cesarean section for a variety of conditions; main results and author's conclusions are reported below: Dodd JM, Crowther CA, Huertas E, Guise JM, Horey D. Planned elective repeat caesarean section versus planned v aginal birth for women with a previous caesarean birth. (2013). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 12. Art. No.: CD004224. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004224.pub3. Main results: Two randomised trials involving 320 women and their infants were included. However, data for maternal and infant clinical outcomes were available from one trial with very low event rates, involving 22 women only. For the primary outcomes maternal death or serious morbidity (one study; 22 women; risk ratio (RR) not estimable), and infant death or serious morbidity (one study; 22 women; RR not estimable), there were no statistically significant differences between planned caesarean birth and planned vaginal birth identified. Authors' conclusions: Planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned VBAC for women with a prior caesarean birth are both associated with benefits and harms. Evidence for these care practices is largely drawn from non -randomised studies, associated with potential bias. Any results and conclusions must therefore be interpreted with caution. Randomised controlled trials are required to provide the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of both planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned vaginal birth for women with a previous caesarean birth. Alfirevic Z, Milan SJ, Livio S. Caesarean section versus vaginal delivery for preterm birth in singletons. (2013). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 9. Art. No.: CD000078. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000078.pub3. Main results: We included six studies (involving 122 women) but only four studies (involving only 116 women) contributed data to the analyses. Infant There were very little data of relevance to the three main (primary) outcomes considered in this review: There was no s ignificant difference between planned immediate caesarean section and planned vaginal delivery with respect to birth injury to infant (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95%, confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 5.62; one trial, 38 women) or birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women). The only cases of birth trauma were a laceration of the buttock in a baby who was delivered by caesarean section and mild bruising in another allocated to the group delivered vaginally. The difference between the two gr oups with regard to perinatal deaths was not significant (0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.14; three trials, 89 women) and there were no data specifically relating to neonatal admission to special care and/or intensive care unit. There was also no difference between the caesarean or vaginal delivery groups in terms of markers of possible birth asphyxia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.14; one trial, 12 women) or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.60; four trials, 115 women) and no difference in attempts at breastfeeding (RR 1.40, 95% 0.11 to 17.45; one trial, 12 women). There was also no difference in neonatal fitting/seizures (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.32; 77 women), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 82.01; one trial, 12 women) or respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.10; three trials, 103 women). There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to meconium aspiration. There was also no significant difference between the two groups for abnormal follow -up in childhood (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.22; one trial, 38 women) or delivery less than seven days after entry (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24; two trials, 51 women). Mother There were no data reported on maternal admissions to intensive care. However, there were seven cases of major maternal postpartum complications in the group allocated to planned immediate caesarean section and none in the group randomised to vaginal delivery (RR 7.21, 95% CI 1.37 to 38.08; four trial s, 116 women). There were no data reported in the trials specifically relating to maternal satisfaction (postnatal). There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to postpartum haemorrhage. A number of non-prespecified secondary outcomes were also considered in the analyses. There was a significant advantage for women in the vaginal delivery group with respect to maternal puerperal pyrexia (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.53; three trials, 89 women) and other maternal infection (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.02 to 6.78; three trials, 103 women), but no significant differences in wound infection (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.18 to 7.70; three trials, 103 women), maternal stay more than 10 days (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.65; three trials, 78 women) or the need for blood transfusion (results not estimable). Authors' conclusions: There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of a policy of planned immediate caesarean delivery for preterm babies. Further studies are needed in this area, but recruitment is proving difficult. Hofmeyr GJ, Barrett JF, Crowther CA. Planned caesarean section for women with a twin pregnancy. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. (2011). Issue 12. Art. No.: CD006553. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006553.pub2 Main results: One small trial with unconfirmed allocation concealment compared caesarean section with planned vaginal birth in 60 women with vertex/non -vertex twin pregnancies. There were no differences in perinatal outcome. The trial was too small to exclude the possibility of clinically meaningful benefits of either approach. There is one additional trial currently ongoing. Authors' conclusions: There is a lack of robust evidence to guide clinical advice regarding the method of birth for twin pregnancies. Women should be informed of possible benefits and risks of either approach, including short- term and long -term consequences for both mother and babies. Future research should aim to provide unbiased evidence, including long -term outcomes. Summary: The recently published evidence does not contradict the current coverage guidance recommendations. Topic: Knee arthroscopy for osteoarthritis Coverage Recommendation (Box Language): In the absence of other appropriate indications, arthroscopic lavage and debridement of knee osteoarthritis (or osteoarthrosis) should not be covered.

Summary results and/or conclusions are presented below: Reichenbach S, Rutjes AWS, N\u00fcesch E, Trelle S, J\u00fcni P. Joint lavage for osteoarthritis of the knee. (2010). Cochrane D atabase of Systematic Reviews. Issue 5. Art. No.: CD007320. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007320.pub2. Main results: We included seven trials with 567 patients. Three trials examined arthroscopic joint lavage, two non -arthroscopic joint lavage and two tidal irrigation. The methodological quality and the quality of reporting was poor and we identified a moderate to large degree of heterogeneity among the trials (I2 = 65%). We found little evidence for a benefit of joint lavage in terms of pain relief at three mont hs (SMD - 0.11, 95% CI - 0.42 to 0.21), corresponding to a difference in pain scores between joint lavage and control of 0.3 cm on a 10 -cm visual analogue scale (VAS). Results for improvement in function at three months were similar (SMD - 0.10, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.11), corresponding to a difference in function scores between joint lavage and control of 0.2 cm on a WOMAC disability sub -scale from 0 to 10. For pain, estimates of effect sizes varied to some degree depending on the type of lavage, but this variatio n was likely to be explained by differences in the credibility of control interventions: trials using sham interventions to closely mimic the process of joint lavage showed a null -effect. Reporting on adverse events and drop out rates was unsatisfactory, a nd we were unable to draw conclusions for these secondary outcomes. Authors' conclusions: Joint lavage does not result in a relevant benefit for patients with knee osteoarthritis in terms of pain relief or improvement of function. Summary: The recently pu blished evidence does not contradict the current coverage guidance recommendations. Topic: Neuroimaging in Dementia Coverage Recommendation (Box Language): Screening of asymptomatic patients for dementia with neuroimaging should not be covered. Structural neuroimaging should be covered to rule out reversible causes of dementia.* In patients with mild cognitive impairment, imaging should not be used to predict progression of the risk of developing dementia. Functional neuroimaging (PET, SPECT or fMRI) should not be covered for screening, diagnosis, or monitoring of dementia. Source report: Clark, E.E., & Little, A., (2010). Imaging in dementia.

Summary results and/or conclusions of the two completed reviews are presented below: Zhang S, Smailagic N, Hyde C, Noel -Storr AH, Takwoingi Y, McSh ane R, Feng J. 11C -PIB-PET for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). (2014) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 7. Art. No.: CD010386. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010386.pub2. Main results: Conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in nine studies. The quality of the evidence was limited. Of the 274 participants included in the meta - analysis, 112 developed Alzheimer's dementia. Based on the nine included studies, the median proportion converting was 34%. The studies varied markedly in how the PIB scans were done and interpreted. The sensitivities were between 83% and 100% while the specificities were between 46% and 88%. Because of the variation in thresholds and measures of 11C -PIB amyloid retention, we did not calculate summary sensitivity and specificity. Although subject to considerable uncertainty, to illustrate the potential strengths and weaknesses of 11C - PIB-PET scans we estimated from t he fitted summary ROC curve that the sensitivity was 96% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87 to 99) at the included study median specificity of 58%. This equated to a positive likelihood ratio of 2.3 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07. Assuming a typical conversion rate of MCI to Alzheimer's dementia of 34%, for every 100 PIB scans one person with a negative scan would progress and 28 with a positive scan would not actually progress to Alzheimer's dementia. There were limited data for formal investigatio n of heterogeneity. We performed two sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of type of reference standard and the use of a pre -specified threshold. There was no effect on our findings. Authors' conclusions: Although the good sensitivity achieved in some included studies is promising for the value of 11C -PIB-PET, given the heterogeneity in the conduct and interpretation of the test and the lack of defined thresholds for determination of test positivity, we cannot recommend its routine use in clinical practice.11C -PIB-PET biomarker is a high cost investigation, therefore it is important to clearly demonstrate its accuracy and standardise the process of the 11C -PIB diagnostic modality prior to it being widely used.

Beta Amyloid Imaging with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for Evaluation of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease or Other Causes of Cognitive Decline. \"beta amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) to evaluate suspected Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other causes of co gnitive decline does not meet the TEC criteria.\" Has regulatory approval Evidence is insufficient to support conclusions concerning the impact of beta amyloid PET imaging with florbetapir F18 on health outcomes. The evidence to date focuses solely on t he correlation between the results of beta amyloid PET imaging and other indicators of cognitive decline, clinical diagnoses, and histopathologic results. Studies are needed to define the accuracy of beta amyloid imaging according to age (since beta amyloid deposition increases with age in cognitively normal individuals). Further evidence is also needed on the link between the test results and improving health outcomes. Because evidence is insufficient to permit conclusions on the effect of beta amyloid P ET imaging on health outcomes, any improvement cannot be established. Comparative benefit cannot be established lacking sufficient evidence. Have not been evaluated outside the investigational setting. Summary: The recently published evidence does not contradict the current coverage guidance recommendations. Given three reviews currently in progress, it may be reasonable to consider updating this guidance once those reviews have been completed. Topic: Routine Ultrasound in Pregnancy Coverage Recommendation (Box Language): Routine ultrasound for average risk pregnant women should be covered only: Once in the first trimester for the purpose of identifying fetal aneuploidy or anomaly (between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation) and/or dating confirmation. In some instances, if a patient's LMP is truly unknown, a dating ultrasound may be indicated prior to an aneuploidy screen. Once for the purpose of anatomy screening after 18 weeks gestation Only one type of routine prenatal ultrasound should be covered in a single day (i.e., transvaginal or abdominal).

Hayes was the author of the WA HTA report, and the document contains essentially the same information. Summary: No evidence has been published in the trusted sources since this guidance document was created. Therefore, it appears unlikely to need updating. Topic: Non -pharmacologic Interventions for Treatment Resistant Depression Coverage Recommendation (Box Language): In patients with an episode of major depressive disorder who have failed an initial trial of antidepressants, psychotherapy should be covered. In patients with an episode of major depressive disorder who have failed at least two or more pharmacologic treatments the following treatments should be covered: 1) Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 2) Electroconvulsive therapy Vagus n erve stimulation should not be covered.

Summary results and/or conclusions are presented below: Nonpharmacological Treatments for Treatment Resistant Depression. (2014) http://www.hca.wa.gov/hta/Documents/TRD_final_report_022114.pdf Summary: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been in use for decades, but its efficacy has not been extensively investigated in rec ent decades. Only 2 small sham -controlled trials of ECT published in 1980 and 1981 and a comparison of ECT with new pharmacotherapy published in 1997 were reviewed for this report. Trials published prior to 1980 were excluded from the 2011 AHRQ evidence re port on Nonpharmacologic Interventions for Treatment -Resistant Depression in Adults and hence were also excluded from the present report. Even the included RCTs of ECT may have limited generalizability to current practice because of differences in standard antidepressant (AD) medication regimens. Some investigators have considered ECT the standard treatment for TRD against which to compare repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as an alternative more acceptable to patients. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of rTMS compared with sham stimulation in patients with TRD. There is no evidence suggesting that rTMS is more effective than ECT, and the comparability of the 2 treatments has not been conclusively established. Although sham -controlled studies of rTMS showed no adverse effect on cognitive function, comparator trials did not prove rTMS to be safer than ECT in this regard. No serious safety issues were identified in trials of rTMS. Several variations are possible for the way ECT and rTMS are delivered, but optimal treatment parameters have not been identified. There is no evidence of at least moderate quality that establishes an association between the treatment effect of ECT or rTMS and the type of subgroup characteristics listed in Key Question #3. These conclusions regarding ECT and rTMS are consistent with the conclusions of the 2011 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evidence review, although the AHRQ conclusions were based only on studies in which patie nts had experienced 2 failed antidepressant (AD) trials. The authors of the AHRQ review noted that findings from the overall evidence base were consistent with findings specific to studies defining TRD as 2 AD failures but that the effect of combining patients meeting different definitions of TRD was unclear. The AHRQ review did not address treatment parameters and addressed only a limited number of patient characteristics (see Appendix V). There is some positive evidence suggesting that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is efficacious as a treatment for TRD, but pooled estimates of response and remission were nonsignificant. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been studied only in very small case series with pretest/posttest (before -and-after ) analyses; although mean improvement was demonstrated, no conclusion regarding causality may be made. DBS can result in serious complications. The literature provides very little direct evidence of improvement in quality of life (QOL) or functional status attributable to the technologies of interest. However, there is some evidence that lower symptom scores are associated with better function and QOL (this issue was not systematically investigated for this report). Thus, improvement in depression symptoms may also result in improvement in QOL and general function. Evidence of the durability of post -treatment benefits is sparse or missing for all of the technologies of interest. One of the deficiencies of existing research evidence is the lack of a standard definition of TRD. The literature suggests a growing consensus that failure of 2 prior adequate trials of AD medication is an appropriate definition of TRD. The evidence review ed for this report suggests that rTMS and ECT are effective even when TRD is defined as 1 failed AD trial. There was low -quality evidence suggesting that the effectiveness of ECT diminishes as medication resistance increases. The oft -cited STAR*D trial d emonstrated that the effectiveness of new AD medication also diminishes with each round of failed treatment. No studies directly assessed the effectiveness of rTMS according to degree of medication resistance. Where reported in studies of tDCS, patients ha d generally failed 2 AD trials in their lifetime, but the evidence does not permit a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of tDCS by degree of medication. Studies of DBS required a failure of 3 prior AD trials. Related to the lack of a standard definition of TRD is the need for greater standardization in the manner in which the adequacy of AD trials is defined and whether medication resistance should be demonstrated in the current episode. Regarding the duration of an adequate AD trial, 6 weeks was the most common threshold in studies that addressed this issue in inclusion criteria, American Psychiatric Association guidelines on the management of MDD advise that an AD trial should be continued 4 to 8 weeks, and other sources suggest 10 to 12 weeks f or an adequate trial. No distinction was made in the studies reviewed for this report between patients who were and were not compliant in previous AD treatment. Very few studies clarified whether patients were enrolled on the basis of AD failure at any tim e in the past or on the basis of failure during the current episode. No studies of any of the technologies of interest compared the technology with usual care or evaluated the technology as an add -on to usual care. Only 2 comparisons of nonpharmacologic t reatment (ECT in 1 study, tDCS in the other) with a new AD medication as the control were identified. More studies providing a comparison with real- world alternatives are needed, ideally with a sham- controlled arm as well as a new pharmacotherapy or usual care arm. BCBS. (2014). Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Depression. http://www.bcbs.com/blueresources/tec/vols/28/28_09.pdf Has regulatory approval Three large, and many small, trials have compared TMS with sham for treatment - resistant depression. Two of the large trials employed a \"duration adaptive design\" that enforces dropout of patients failing to improve after 3 weeks. Effect estimates after the initial 3 -week follow- ups a re potentially biased and longer term follow -up of these trials is difficult to interpret. Limited data have been reported from the third trial because it is unpublished. No significant results were reported in the intention -to-treat analyses after 6 or 16 weeks of TMS. Results from other small trials, along with the 2 large published trials, have been included in meta- analyses. Although pooled effect estimates from the meta- analyses favor TMS, results from the later and potentially biased follow -up of the 2 large trials were used. Only one of the 7 meta -analyses reviewed evaluated study quality. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov identified unpublished completed studies. The available evidence does not permit conclusions regarding the effect of TMS on health outcomes. The available evidence does not permit conclusions on whether TMS improves the net health outcome. Lacking evidence to support conclusions about the effect of TMS on health outcomes, it is not possible to compare with established alternatives. Have not been evaluated outside the investigational setting. Summary: The recently published evidence is conflicting, with the WA HTA review supporting the current coverage guidance recommendations and the BCBS technology evaluation contradicting it. The primary discrepancy appears to be that BCBS believes that two of three large trials may be biased because of the trial design, and in addition, they are concerned about the existence of unpublished studies.
