This Programme incorporated two existing pr ogrammes fr om the World H ealth O rganization, the Expanded P rogramme on I mmunization and the former P rogramme for Vaccine D evelopment, and a ne w unit for Vaccine S upply and Q uality was established. The P rogramme thus has terms of r eference that span from basic v accine r esearch, thr ough v accine pr oduction and quality contr ol, to helping ministries of health plan and manage their immunization ser vices and contr ol vaccine-pr eventable diseases. This document is the thir d strategic plan for the G lobal P rogramme for Vaccines and I mmunization. I t cov- ers the period 1998 to the y ear 2001 and describes the targets and indicators for the P rogramme for each main heading. The plan is compatible with the WHO-wide A ctivity M anagement S ystem (AMS) and is reviewed and r evised annually . A four-y ear strategic plan and a two-y ear budget will be pr oduced ev ery two years. The strategic plan is written for thr ee gr oups of people: the managers of the P rogramme itself , the Programme 's contributors (be they financial contributors or contributors in time and effor t) and WHO' s administration. The plan helps the P rogramme to be clear about its objectiv es and activities. I t also opens the P rogramme to scr utiny and debate, encouraging br oad discussion about its priorities and activities and ho w best they can be achiev ed. The document has four sections: sSection one describes briefly the G lobal P rogramme's mission, principal objectiv es, and priorities. sSection t wocontains a summar y of the P rogramme 's planned costs, budgets, unmet needs for 1998-1999 and expected income for 1998. sSection thr eecontains a description of the pr ogress made during 1994-1997, the achiev ements and constraints. M ilestones and indicators ar e given - with funds needed, funds av ailable and unmet needs. This information is r epeated for each of the P rogramme 's principal activities under three headings: Self-sufficiency Disease contr ol New vaccines sSection f our contains fiv e annex es with details of the high priority countries for the differ ent disease r eduction activities.IXGPV mission, structures,objec tives and pr iorities The mission of the G lobal Programme for Vaccines and Immunization: A world in which all people at risk ar e protected against vaccine-pr eventable diseases.The table b elow pr esen ts the tar gets of the P rogramme under the 13 ar eas of w ork of the G lobal P rogramme f or Vaccines and I mmuniza tion.

Meanwhile, laboratory and field studiesconfirmed the safety of using vaccine vials for multiple sessions,thereby eliminating the need to discard liquid vaccine at theend of each session.Then, in 1997, the first vaccine vial monitor(VVM) was introduced into the programme, making it easier forprogrammes to accept the use of liquid vaccines onsubsequent days. However, many countries, especially thosereceiving donated vaccines, are not yet using appropriate vialsizes, nor have they adopted the multi-dose vial policy. MILESTONES/TARGETS By 1998: s Vaccine vial monitors (VVMs) introduced on two vaccines - in addition to oral polio vaccine. s Vaccine wastage for liquid vaccines reduced by 50%. By 1999: s VVMs introduced on remaining vaccines used inimmunization programmes. By 2000: s Vaccines provided in containers that maximize efficiency. INDICATORS s Doses used per target population/doses shipped toprogramme ( Status: as of December 1997, 57%). s Number of vaccines used in immunization programmes with VVM ( Status: as of December 1997, one vaccine).Maximising efficiency of vaccine containers UNTIL recently, over 50% of vac- cine used in routine immuniza- tion was thrown away at the end of theday to avoid the risk of loss of potencydue to possible exposure to heat. Once amultiple-dose vaccine vial had beentaken out of a refrigerator or vaccinecarrier and opened for use, there was noway of knowing whether it was stillpotent after several hours at a highertemperature. As a result, all partly usedvaccine vials were thrown away at theend of the day. Additional doses werelost when the potency of the vaccine wasin doubt after a breach in the cold chain.Further wastage occurred when the stat-ed number of doses could not beobtained from the vaccine vial due tothe inefficient design of the vial andstopper.

VI VACCINE E VALUATION IN ENDEMIC AREA WITH PO TENTIAL RISK OF OUTBREAKS The incr eased number of typhoid fev er cases r eported in Uzbekistan during the last fe w years highlights the potential for a major epidemic in this countr y. Epidemiological studies hav e sho wn that incr eased incidence is likely to be r elated to the use of water in U zbekistan which originates fr om open r eservoirs in neighbouring Tajikistan. In Uzbekistan, distribution of purified water to the whole population is not feasible. Although other public healthmeasur es kno wn to pr event the person-to-person spr ead of typhoid fev er will be initiated, based on pr evious experience in the r egion, it is the opinion of exper ts that contr ol of a potential epidemic of multi-dr ug resistant typhoid strains will need complementar y inter ventions as w ell.

The Programme comprisesthree units: Expanded Programme on Immunization Vaccine Research and Development Vaccine Supply and Quality The Expanded Programme on Immunization focuses on the prevention of selected childhood diseases and, through support to national immunizationprogrammes, aims to achieve 90% immunization coverage of children born eachyear. Its goals are to eradicate poliomyelitis from the world by the year 2000,reduce measles deaths and incidence, eliminate neonatal tetanus as a publichealth problem and introduce hepatitis B vaccine in all countries. Vaccine Research and Development supports and promotes research and development associated with the introduction of new vaccines into the ExpandedProgramme on Immunization. This includes research and development of newvaccines, improvement of immunization procedures and support toepidemiological studies. Vaccine Supply and Quality ensures adequate quantities of high quality, affordable vaccines for all the world's children, supports the efforts of governments tobecome self-reliant as regards their vaccine needs, and assists in the rapidintroduction of new vaccines.
