VSV-EBOV was developed by a scientist hired in the Canadian public health system. Like many advances in science, this one came from alertness to unexpected results. Because Canada 20 years ago lacked adequate high-security biocontainment laboratory facilities, while such level-4 labs were in process [Dr. Feldman used a safer method](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/the-canadian-vaccine-how-scientists-in-a-country-without-a-single-case-of-ebola-wrestle-the-deadly-disease-to-the-gorund)of studying Ebola. He attached an Ebola glycoprotein to an unrelated virus called VZV, vesicular stomatitis virus, a virus not particularly dangerous to humans that caused disease in sheep and cows. He was infecting mice with this modified VZV-EBOV virus, and noticed that they were not getting sick. He wondered if the glycoprotein was inducing immunity, so got permission to try a real Ebola virus on the mice. They survived. This research was picking up in the early 2000's, and post 9-11 there was renewed interest and funding for combatting bioterrorism. The US military paid to test the potential VZV-EBOV in monkeys. It was effective. A small US company bought the rights to the vaccine but then nothing happened to develop it for almost a decade. The decade in which our Bundibugyo epidemic occurred, though this strain was different so the vaccine may not have helped us. Why the long dormancy? Ebola occurs sporadically, in rural African places, affecting predominantly poor and isolated populations. That was not enough to drive the market towards profitability for vaccine development. Then in 2014-2015, an Ebola epidemic in West Africa raged out of control. There was panic that this disease would spread out of Africa. It became clear that a larger company would need to buy the vaccine rights to move forward on testing and development. Merck bought the vaccine, and GAVI [stepped in](https://www.blogger.com/)to push development forward. Pharmaceutical companies are profit-driven entities, and there is not much profit in Ebola. I know that many people put faith in the free market to solve our problems, but in this case we would NOT be where we are today without GAVI. [GAVI](https://www.gavi.org/)is an organization seeded with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation that now includes dozens of other private foundations and national entities, a massive alliance to bridge the gap between need and profit. Simply by [infusing 5 million dollars](file:///Users/jennifermyhre/Downloads/Ebola%20roadmap%20-%20public%20summary.pdf)into Merck to get the vaccine up and running for clinical trials, and promising up to 300 million dollars into the future, we went from a monkey-experiment to viable human use. By the time they were able to field test, the massive multi-country West African epidemic was nearly over, and those trials were not sufficiently powerful to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. However the capacity was now primed to be ready for the next disaster. GAVI continued to push behind the scenes from 2016-2018, actually quite remarkably they went against their own policy in order to fund a vaccine that was not yet licensed. When Ebola was confirmed in North Kivu province, Eastern DRC, on August 1, 2018, they were ready. This epidemic is not showing signs of control yet Over the last ten months 122,695 people have been vaccinated in a ring strategy: once a diagnosis is confirmed, all the contacts of that person then all their contacts are vaccinated. Initial results from this epidemic [show 97.5% efficacy](https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/ebola-ring-vaccination-results-12-april-2019.pdf)for this vaccination, though it takes about ten days to see immunity so the post-exposure strategy has some drawbacks. Health care workers have been immunized in the region pre-exposure as well. The VSV-EBOV vaccine still has not been adequately studied for licensure: dose, duration of immunity, need for a booster dose, safety in children and pregnant women, etc. are all unanswered questions. Our Serge medical workers in DRC and Uganda received the vaccine, but we sadly missed the moment when it was being offered. The hospital where we work is probably the closest in Uganda to the DRC border, about 60 miles from Beni and 100 from Butembo/Katwa, the disease epicenters, with thousands of people crossing the borders and dozens of alerts for potential cases we have felt both vulnerable to exposure, and awed that none has yet occurred. We assumed that if a case was documented in Uganda, we would be offered the vaccine then, and hoped it wouldn't be too late. the location of the disease does not inspire action . . . this is a close-up of the DRC-Uganda border zone.

About to be jabbed [another $9million](https://www.gavi.org/library/news/press-releases/2019/gavi-boosts-funding-for-ebola-outbreak-response/)for this epidemic response. There are good people making good decisions out there, which gives us all hope. A decade ago, a vaccine for Ebola was a dream in a book. Now we actually got one. Amazing. "}
