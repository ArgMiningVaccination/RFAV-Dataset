Which supplements, diets and foods can extend lifespan and improve longevity?", "sitename": "NOVOS", "date": "2022-03-16", "cleaned_text": "What are the best supplements, diets, and other interventions to slow down aging and live longer and healthier? With all the conflicting research out there, it can be difficult to know where to turn for the best recommendations. In an effort to bring you the most up-to-date and accurate information, we've compiled our thoughts on this topic below. But first, let's look at why it can be challenging to make sense of all the available advice \u2014 and why the NOVOS Complete Longevity Protocol is the one we recommend for living longer and healthier. Why do we need a longevity regimen? It's easy to get lost in a maze of conflicting studies. There is no shortage of research on aging and longevity. However, there is a lack of consensus among these studies and their interpretations by scientists, doctors, and nutritionists. The most common problem with nutritional science is that it doesn't always give us clear answers about what works best for each individual person, nor does it necessarily account for the synergistic effects of various supplements working in harmony for our health. Here are just some of the reasons to be skeptical about the \"typical\" recommendations for health and longevity. 1. Official recommendations often fall short As we [discussed before](https://novoslabs.com/best-food-supplements-to-take-even-when-you-eat-healthy/), people often need higher amounts of vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients than what official government recommendations advise (the \"recommended daily allowances,\" or RDAs). These recommendations are often based on crude measurements and old studies and mainly focus on the short term-effects of deficiencies; they often don't look at the long-term effects, given most studies only last a few weeks or months. 2. Most MDs are not trained in preventive medicine and longevity Unfortunately, most medical doctors are not trained in slowing down aging, prevention, nutrition, and supplements, so many patients are on their own. Additionally, some health professionals believe that official recommendations and meta-analyses are perfect evidence and definitive and that for each ingredient, the right doses are all properly figured out and calculated. Unfortunately, biology and health are very complex, and many clinical trials and meta-analyses have various shortcomings (e.g., short time periods, using only one or a few ingredients, using crude biomarkers, and so on). 3. Blood tests are bad at tracking down deficiencies Some people believe they don't need supplements because they have a \"normal\" blood test. However, blood tests are bad at tracking down deficiencies, so don't over-rely on them, as we explain [here](https://novoslabs.com/are-blood-tests-good-to-assess-your-health-and-longevity-status/). 4. \"If you eat healthily, you don't need supplements\" Many people believe that if they eat healthily, they don't need supplements. However, even when you eat healthily, there is still a high risk of getting suboptimal amounts of vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients. For example, people eating a more plant-based diet are at higher risk of iron, zinc, and B vitamin deficiencies. Supplements are necessary because humans are not made by nature to properly absorb all nutrients, given evolution doesn't prioritize the long term, as we explain [here](https://novoslabs.com/are-supplements-necessary/). An epidemic of overnourished, nutrient-deficient people? To make a long and complicated story short, we believe that there is an epidemic going on, in which many people are deficient in various micronutrients, most commonly iodine, magnesium, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, iron, choline, calcium, and others. Deficiencies in these micronutrients can cause lots of \"vague\" complaints such as brain fog, fatigue, muscle aches, sleep problems, concentration problems, hyperactivity, allergies, constipation, irritable bowel disease, joint pains, and others. Most doctors find these complaints difficult to treat, given they are not properly trained in nutrition, supplements, and prevention in general. Even worse, deficiencies in vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients over the course of decades could increase the risk of serious diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes, auto-immune diseases, heart disease, and macular degeneration and can increase the rate of aging. To remedy this, we compiled a list of fundamental supplements, foods, and other interventions to adopt into your long-term health routine for optimal health and longevity. We call this ultimate guide the \"NOVOS Longevity Protocol.\" Note: all brands, products, or websites mentioned are not sponsored. That way, we can provide you with impartial recommendations. We find this very important! The NOVOS Longevity Protocol A. Supplements Tips: - Look for common vitamins and minerals like calcium, vitamin D, iron, and zinc at large retailers such as CVS or Boots, or through sites like iHerb - Good supplement brands include Solgar, Jarrow, Douglas Labs, Doctor's Best, and NOW Foods - Ask your pharmacist or MD if they can provide you with a high-quality brand or supplement - Try NOVOS Core and NOVOS Boost to combine certain supplements synergistically as part of your overall supplement regimen MORNING B vitamin complex Why: Key for converting food into energy (metabolism), creating new blood cells, and maintaining healthy skin cells, brain cells, and other body tissues. When: Take in the morning or at noon, not in the evening, as B vitamins can provide energy. How much: Take a high-dose vitamin B complex containing all B vitamins at least a few times the recommended daily allowance (RDA). Important: - The vitamin B complex should contain at least vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9 (B11 or folic acid), and B12. All these B vitamins work synergistically. - Don't take in more than 20-25 mg of vitamin B6 per day \u2014 too much vitamin B6 can lead to nerve damage in the long term. Examples (not sponsored): [Douglas Labs Stress-B-Plus](https://www.douglaslabs.eu/stressbplus.html): or 1/2 pill per day. [Thorne Stress B-Complex](https://www.iherb.com/pr/thorne-research-stress-b-complex-60-capsules/49834): 1/2 pill per day. [Doctor's Best Fully Active B complex](https://www.iherb.com/pr/doctor-s-best-fully-active-b-complex-with-quatrefolic-30-veggie-caps/50940): 1/2 pill per day. Phosphatidylcholine Why: Used to make a key neurotransmitter that contributes to memory; may help to reduce fat deposits, alleviate ulcerative colitis symptoms, and support metabolic health. When: After breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner, or before bedtime. How much: Three times 420 mg per day or twice 840 mg per day. Important: - Ideally, combine phosphatidylcholine with phosphatidylserine (1 to 3 times 100 mg per day, e.g. [this brand](https://www.iherb.com/pr/jarrow-formulas-ps-100-phosphatidylserine-100-mg-120-capsules/280)\u2014 not sponsored); the latter is also important for better brain function. - In some people, phosphatidylserine can lead to reduced sleep, so take it in the morning or try a lower dose. Examples (not sponsored): [Solgar Phosphatidylcholine](https://www.solgar.com/products/phosphatidylcholine-softgels/): 3 capsules per day (3 x 420 mg), one after breakfast, one after dinner, and one before sleep. [Natural Factors Phosphatidylcholine](https://www.iherb.com/pr/natural-factors-phosphatidyl-choline-pc-420-mg-90-softgels/2649): 3 capsules per day (3 x 420 mg), one after breakfast, one after dinner, and one before sleep. Vitamin D Why: Strengthens muscles and bones, improves mood, boosts heart function and mood, and reduces inflammation. When: After breakfast. How much: 4,000-5,000 international units (IU, not microgram) per day; with this dosage, there is hardly any risk of accumulating too much vitamin D in the body. Important: - Take vitamin D3, not vitamin D2. - Always combine vitamin D with vitamin K. Vitamin D improves uptake of calcium, while vitamin K ensures the calcium ends up in the bone and not artery walls, where it could lead to arterial calcification. - 40 IU of vitamin D = 1 microgram of vitamin D. So 4,000 IU of vitamin D = 100 micrograms of vitamin D. Examples (not sponsored): [Douglas Labs Vitamin D](https://www.douglaslabs.com/vitamin-d-5-000-i-u.html): one per day, after breakfast. [Jarrow Vitamin D3](https://www.amazon.com/Jarrow-Formulas-Supports-Metabolism-Softgels/dp/B003B6RB98): one per day, after breakfast. Vitamin K Why: Assists in blood clotting, regulation of blood calcium levels, and bone metabolism. When: After breakfast. How much: Take vitamin K2 (not only or just vitamin K1), minimally around 180 to 360 microgram (ug) per day. Important: - Ideally full spectrum vitamin K2, containing one or more menaquinones (e.g., MK-4, MK-7, MK-9, etc). - Always combine vitamin K with vitamin D supplements. These two substances work synergistically. - If you take anticoagulant drugs (blood thinners), first contact your health practitioner before taking vitamin K. Examples (not sponsored): [Life Extension Super K](https://www.iherb.com/pr/life-extension-super-k-90-softgels/90368): one tablet per day, after an (ideally fatty) meal. [Life Extension Super K Elite](https://www.iherb.com/pr/life-extension-super-k-elite-30-softgels/90369?rec=iherbtest-pdp-related): one tablet per day, after an (ideally fatty) meal. [Doctor's Best Natural Vitamin K2 MK-7](https://www.iherb.com/pr/doctor-s-best-natural-vitamin-k2-mk-7-with-menaq7-100-mcg-60-veggie-caps/61585): two tablets per day, after an (ideally fatty) meal. Zinc Why: Aids immune system and metabolism function, reduces inflammation, and reduces the risk of age-related diseases. When: After breakfast. How much: 15 mg per day. Important: - Don't take more than 25 mg per day of zinc via supplements. Too much zinc can also be unhealthy. - Never take zinc together with copper, given they inhibit each other's absorption. So take zinc, for example, in the morning and copper in the evening. - The exact form of zinc is not important (e.g., zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, and zinc glycinate are all OK). Examples (not sponsored): - Available at CVS, GNC, Holland & Barrett, Boots, and many other (drug)stores. [Holland & Barrett Zinc](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/holland-barrett-high-strength-zinc-tablets-15mg-60005711): one tablet after breakfast. Vitamin C Why: Induces autophagy, improves the epigenome, can improve mitochondrial function, and positively impacts aging; one of the [key ingredients in NOVOS Core](https://novoslabs.com/novos-anti-aging-longevity-supplement/vitamin-c-anti-aging-supplement-longevity/). When: After breakfast and after dinner. How much: 2 x 400 - 500 mg per day. Examples (not sponsored): - Available at CVS, GNC, Holland & Barrett, Boots, and many other (drug)stores. [21st Century Vitamin C](https://www.iherb.com/pr/21st-century-vitamin-c-500-mg-250-tablets/41309): two per day, after breakfast and after dinner. Omega-3 fatty acids Why: May protect against certain diseases and conditions such as cancer and heart disease and help control conditions such as lupus, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis. When: After breakfast, lunch, or dinner. How much: An omega-3 supplement containing at least 1,200 mg of DHA + EPA. Important: - Make sure you take at least 1,200 mg of DHA + EPA per day; low doses have little effect. - Buy high-end omega-3 supplements of which the omega-3 is not too oxidized (low TOTOX value). Most supplements contain highly oxidized omega-3s. - Opt for the triglyceride form of omega-3 (not the ethyl ester form), as from fish or algae. - Ideally, buy a supplement that contains both triglyceride omega-3 (e.g., from fish and/or algae) and the phosphatidylcholine form (e.g., from krill). - Also, regularly consume fish roe (e.g., herring roe, lumpfish roe, salmon roe, caviar), given it contains the lysophosphatidylcholine form of omega-3, which is much better taken up by the brain. - Learn more about how to properly take omega-3 fatty acids [here](https://novoslabs.com/what-are-the-best-omega-3-supplements-a-guide/). Examples (not A Why: Helps to support and maintain optimal health of the immune system, eyes, and reproductive system. When: After breakfast. How much: Take retinol palmitate at 1 x 2,500 units (half a tablet) per day. Important: - Take the animal form of vitamin A (retinoids, e.g., retinol palmitate) and not the plant-based form (carotenoids) as supplements. Not all carotenoids are converted properly into retinoids. - Always combine a vitamin A supplement with a vitamin D supplement. - Don't take high doses of vitamin A (e.g., more than 10,000 units per day, given this can, for example, interfere with vitamin D metabolism). Examples (not sponsored): [Solgar Dry Vitamin A 5000 IU](https://www.solgar.com/products/dry-vitamin-a-1500-mcg-5000-iu-tablets/): take half a tablet per day. Magnesium Why: Magnesium malate combines magnesium and malic acid to help boost blood sugar control, mood, and exercise performance while reducing chronic pain. When: After breakfast and before bedtime (magnesium helps to promote relaxation). How much: Take magnesium malate powder, 2 x 1,000 mg of magnesium malate (1,000 mg of magnesium malate contains 150 mg of magnesium) per day. Note: if you take [NOVOS Core](https://novoslabs.com/product/novos-core/), you don't have to take extra magnesium, given NOVOS Core already contains 2,000 mg of magnesium malate. Important: - Do not use magnesium oxide supplements (most common). The best forms of magnesium are magnesium malate and magnesium glycinate (they have improved absorption, and [malate](https://novoslabs.com/novos-anti-aging-longevity-supplement/malate-magnesium-anti-aging-supplement-longevity/)and [glycinate](https://novoslabs.com/longevity-ingredients-glycine/)extend lifespan). - Use a powder, such as magnesium malate powder, given most supplements in pill form contain not enough magnesium. Use a weighing scale (with an accuracy of 0.01 g); these cost around $20 online, like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenTour-Digital-Kitchen-Scale-Multifunction/dp/B07D7P7MJJ/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2KYN15V17DA5X&keywords=0.01g+digital+scale&qid=1647454422&sprefix=0.01g%2Caps%2C193&sr=8-4)(not sponsored). - Make sure you take in around 300 to 500 mg of pure magnesium; this corresponds to a much higher amount of magnesium malate or magnesium glycinate (some labels are Examples (not sponsored): [SeekingHealth Magnesium Malate powder](https://www.seekinghealth.com/products/magnesium-malate-100-servings): 2 x malate (1,000 mg of magnesium malate contains 150 mg of magnesium) per day, after breakfast and before bedtime. Choline Why: Choline is essential for brain and nervous system functioning, playing a role in memory, mood, muscle control, and other functions. It's also essential for forming the membranes around your body's cells. When: In the morning and bedtime. How much: Ideally, choline chloride (since choline bitartrate can sometimes make people too tired): 1 or 2 x 250 mg. Important: - Choline is very important for epigenetic maintenance, DNA stability, brain health, and metabolic health. However, high doses could (depending on your gut microbiome) lead to the production of TMAO, a metabolite created by bacteria in the gut that could contribute to atherosclerosis. Studies looking into choline intake and the risk of heart disease are contradictory nonetheless (R). - Choline is very important for health; a deficiency in choline can increase the risk of fatty liver disease (R), DNA breaks (R), reduced brain health (R), and so on. - If you are doubtful, you can take only phosphatidylcholine and not choline: phosphatidylcholine supplements have not been shown to increase the production of TMAO (R). Or you can take half of the amount of choline (around 250 mg per day), with around 1,200 to 1,600 mg of phosphatidylcholine per day on top of that. Examples (not sponsored): [MyProtein Vitacholine](https://www.myprotein.com/sports-nutrition/vitacholine/11724598.html): 3 capsules daily (this is more than advised on the label), ideally combined with phosphatidylcholine (1,200 to 1,600 mg per day \u2014 see earlier), e.g., one in the morning after breakfast, one after dinner, and one before sleep. High-dose iodine Why: Your body relies on iodine for proper thyroid function, and we recommend a dosage that's at least 8 times higher than governments recommend, as we explain here. When: After breakfast. How much: Iodine pills or droplets (containing both iodine and iodide): around 1,000 - 1,300 microgram (ug) (= 1 - 1.3 mg) per day. Important: - Often, blood tests are normal while still being iodine-deficient (TSH levels are not an accurate measure of iodine deficiency). - Regularly recommended doses of iodine (e.g., 150 ug per day) often have little to no effect. Only when people start to take higher doses (e.g., 1,000 ug per day) do they feel (much) better (e.g. improved thinking, warm feet and hands, better sleep). - It's important that the supplements contain both iodine and iodide. - Gradually build up your intake of iodine. Start with around 100-150 ug/day, and double the dose every 2 weeks until you reach around 1,000-1,200 microgram (= 1-1.2 mg) per day. - To build up your iodine intake stepwise, iodine droplets enable convenient dosing (see further below). When you reach the desired maximal dose, you can use iodine pills. - People who have thyroid problems or who are at risk should be extra careful and discuss with a health professional experienced in thyroid disorders, supplements, and preventive medicine (learn more here). - Given many people are (mildly) iodine-deficient, a sudden increase of iodine will make the thyroid gland work harder; producing free radicals that can damage the thyroid tissue. So always take with iodine the following supplements that protect against free radical damage: - Vitamin C: 2 x 500 mg per day (500 mg in the morning, and 500 mg in the evening) - Selenium: 100-150 microgram (ug) per day (take selenium yeast, not selenium methionine) - Vitamin E via 3 daily handfuls of almonds, hazelnuts, and/or sunflower seeds Learn more how to properly take iodine supplements [here](https://novoslabs.com/how-to-properly-treat-thyroid-disorders-especially-iodine-deficiency-and-hypothyroidism/). Examples (not sponsored): [Life-flo Iodine Plus Drops](https://www.amazon.com/Life-flo-Iodine-Plus-Drops-Ounce/dp/B003B6WXVY/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3DTJHT6234B1Y&keywords=iodine+iodide+droplets&qid=1647281204&sprefix=iodine+iodide+droplets%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-6): start with 3 droplets (150 ug) per day and gradually increase. [Horbaach Iodine droplets](https://www.amazon.com/Supplement-Potassium-Vegetarian-Tincture-Horbaach/dp/B07QB58ZBM/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3DTJHT6234B1Y&keywords=iodine+iodide+droplets&qid=1647281083&sprefix=iodine+iodide+droplets%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-5): start with 3 droplets (150 ug) per day and gradually increase. [Iodoral pills 6.25 mg](https://www.optimox.com/shop/iodoral-iod-6.25/): You can buy a pill cutter and cut pills up into 4 to 5 pieces. A multivitamin Why: Take a multivitamin on top of all substances listed on this page to help fill in any nutritional gaps in your diet. When: After breakfast. How much: One per day. Important: - Despite multivitamins containing too little of various substances (like too little calcium, potassium, or magnesium), the goal is to fill in the gaps regarding more rare elements, like manganese and molybdenum, as we explain [here](https://novoslabs.com/what-is-the-best-multivitamin-and-the-best-way-to-take-a-multivitamin/). - Combine your multivitamin with the other supplements listed on this page to make sure you take in all vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients in sufficiently high amounts, proper doses, and the right form. - Try to avoid multivitamins with \"synthetic\" and/or pro-oxidative vitamin E derivatives like tocopheryl succinate or tocopheryl acetate (take vitamin E mainly via food, as we describe below in the nutrition section). We explain more on how to properly take a multivitamin [here](https://novoslabs.com/what-is-the-best-multivitamin-and-the-best-way-to-take-a-multivitamin/). MIDDAY/AFTERNOON Calcium Why: Calcium is essential for building and maintaining strong bones and ensuring the proper functioning of the heart, muscles, and nerves; it may also protect against cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure. When: Afternoon and evening, as indicated below. How much: 2 x 500 mg, one tablet in the afternoon and one tablet in the evening (e.g., before bedtime, given calcium can also have a calming effect). Important: - Do not take calcium together with iron, as they inhibit each other's absorption. - Do not take more than 1,000 mg in one go, as this can lead to too high of a calcium peak in the blood, which could accelerate calcification of the arteries. Take a maximum of 500 mg of calcium at one time. - Always combine calcium with vitamin D and vitamin K (vitamin D improves the absorption of calcium while vitamin K enables calcium to enter into the bones and not into the blood vessel walls). Examples (not sponsored): - Available at CVS, GNC, Holland & Barrett, Boots, and many other (drug)stores. [Walgreens Calcium 500 mg (with vitamin D3)](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/nature-made-calcium-500-mg-with-vitamin-d3-tablets/ID=prod3950628-product): two per day (taken apart from iron), e.g., one in the afternoon and one before sleep. EVENING (AFTER DINNER) Copper Why: A mineral found throughout the body, copper aids with red blood cell formation and healthy functioning of the immune system and nerve cells. When: After dinner. How much: 2-3 mg per day. Important: - Don't take more than 4 mg of copper per day via supplements. Too much copper can be unhealthy. - Never take copper together with zinc, given they inhibit each other's absorption. So take, for example, zinc in the morning and copper in the evening. Examples (not sponsored): [Holland & Barrett Chelated Copper](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/holland-barrett-chelated-copper-tablets-2mg-60001330): one per day. Iron Why: Iron is key for red blood cell formation; note that certain people, such as pregnant women or those with certain medical conditions, may be prone to low iron levels, making supplementation even more important. When: After dinner. How much: 1 x 15 mg per day. Important: - Never take iron with calcium tablets; they inhibit each other's uptake. For example, take iron in the morning and calcium in the afternoon or evening. - Don't take too much iron; this can be unhealthy (causing too much oxidative damage). So take a maximum of 45 mg per day of iron to be on the safe side and divide over different doses (do not take 45 mg at once). - If you are a woman (women have a higher risk of iron deficiency) or when you consume little red meat, consider taking up to 30 mg of iron per day (ideally spread over two different doses, e.g., 15 mg in the morning and 15 mg in the evening). - It takes at least 3 to 6 months to feel a difference (e.g., more energy) when supplementing with iron. - Sometimes blood tests can be normal (normal ferritin, transferrin, red blood cell width values) but one still can be (mildly) iron-deficient. - Ideally, take iron glycinate (this form is also more gentle on the stomach). Examples: - Available at CVS, GNC, Holland & Barrett, Boots, and many other (drug)stores. [Holland & Barrett Iron 15 mg](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/holland-barrett-iron-15mg-with-vitamins-minerals-caplets-60005395) Vitamin C (see earlier, improves absorption of iron and reduces oxidation of iron and copper). Phosphatidylcholine (see earlier). Choline (see earlier). BEDTIME Melatonin Why: A hormone vital to the natural sleep-wake cycle, melatonin promotes restful sleep and relief from certain sleep disorders. When: 20-30 min. before bed. How much: 300 to 1,000 micrograms (0.3 to 1 mg). Important: - Do not take high doses of melatonin (more than 1 mg). A too high dose causes a steep melatonin peak in the blood, which is not natural. It can also lead to daytime drowsiness. - Always take extended-release melatonin, which is gradually taken up. This emulates a natural increase in melatonin. Also, normal-release melatonin causes a too-fast increase and decrease of melatonin levels, which can interfere with sleep. - Melatonin has been shown to increase lifespan. So even people with no sleep problems but older than 40 or 50 could consider taking it. - We talk more about melatonin and many other tips to improve sleep [here](https://novoslabs.com/tips-to-sleep-well-sleep-better-fall-asleep-faster/). Examples (not sponsored): [Life Extension 6 hour extended-release 750 ug](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Extension-Melatonin-Release-vegetarian/dp/B00BUXKP60): 1 tablet 20-30 min. before bedtime. Magnesium (see earlier, helps you to relax before sleep). Calcium (see earlier, helps you to relax before sleep). Phosphatidylcholine (see earlier, can support healthy sleep). Choline (see earlier, can support healthy sleep).

Nutrition The NOVOS Longevity Diet A healthy diet is the most important method for a healthy, long life. Consume a longevity diet based on the following rules: 1. Drastically reduce your intake of sugary foods, like cookies, candy, cake, candy bars, confectionery foods, etc. Be mindful of \"healthy\" substances that still contain a lot of sugar, like yogurt, (oatmeal) porridge, ketchup, salad dressings, etc. 2. Don't or almost never drink soda. Mainly drink water. Also drink green or white tea or coffee (max 3-5 cups per day). Drink little alcohol (max 1 glass per day with alcohol-free days) or even better, no alcohol. 3. Consume little bread, potatoes, pasta, or rice. These foods are made of starch, which are long chains of glucose and still increase glucose levels in the blood. Replace bread, pasta, rice, and potatoes with: - Legumes - Vegetables - Mushrooms - Quinoa 4. Vegetables (e.g. broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, Brussels sprouts, etc.) should be the basis of your diet, not pasta, potatoes, or rice. Examples: - Instead of bread in the morning, eat a bowl of vegetable milk with quinoa flakes, nuts, blueberries, and avocado pieces. - Instead of potato mash, consume broccoli mash. - Instead of rice, consume mushrooms. - Instead of pasta, consume lentils. 5. No or very little red meat (beef, pork, mutton, veal). Replace red meat with: - White meat: poultry. - (Fatty) fish: e.g., salmon, herring, anchovy, sardines. - Mushrooms: e.g., oyster mushrooms. 6. Consume more healthy fats. Fats are very important for proper functioning of the brain, immunity system, heart, eyes, and so on. Many people in the west consume too little fats. Consume more healthy fats by increasing your intake of (eat daily): - Fatty fish (e.g., salmon, herring, anchovy, sardines) - Nuts (especially walnuts) - Seeds (flaxseed and chia seed are very rich in omega-3 fatty acids) - Dark chocolate - Olive oil - Olives - Avocado Examples of dishes: Breakfast - A bowl with blueberries, walnuts, sliced avocado, and high-fiber quinoa flakes with cashew (vegetable) milk, and dark chocolate and an apple as a dessert. The night before, put frozen blueberries and frozen sliced avocado already in a bowl in the refrigerator so they are thawed the next morning. Lunch or dinner - Chicken or salmon, with legumes (e.g., cannellini beans) and vegetables (e.g., broccoli).

Vegetable protein Hemp protein 30 to 45 grams of pure protein per day. Mix in a glass of water or smoothie. Add stevia or [NOVOS Core](https://novoslabs.com/why-novos-core-is-one-of-the-best-anti-aging-supplements-available/) to improve taste. Important: - Many people, especially women or people who eat healthily, don't take in enough protein. Too little protein can lead to weakness, fatigue, brain fog, a low immune system, dizziness, etc. - We recommend also consuming sufficient amounts of white meat (poultry) and fatty fish as protein sources. Make sure you at least take in at least 60 grams of protein per day via food and vegetable protein powder. - We prefer hemp protein as the best plant-based protein source. Rice protein and pea protein are often more difficult to digest. Pea protein can contain too much lectin. - Do not take animal-based protein like whey protein. Whey protein is a strong simulator of mTOR and other aging pathways. Learn more about animal protein and aging [here](https://novoslabs.com/why-high-animal-protein-carnivore-diets-accelerate-aging/). Vitamin E-rich foods Hazelnuts, almonds, and pumpkin seeds Consume at least 3 handfuls of high-vitamin E foods, namely hazelnuts, almonds, and pumpkin seeds daily. Important: - Vitamin E is crucial for optimal health. However, most people don't take in enough vitamin E. - We, however, do not recommend taking vitamin E supplements, given they mostly contain synthetic forms of vitamin E, or only forms of vitamin E (e.g., alpha-tocopherol) and not the 7 other forms of vitamin E found in nature, and so on (we explain more [here](https://novoslabs.com/best-food-supplements-to-take-even-when-you-eat-healthy/)). - Increase your vitamin E intake via consuming high-vitamin E containing foods, like almonds, hazelnuts, and pumpkin seeds. However, even these \"high-vitamin E\" foods don't contain a lot of vitamin E, so it's important to eat a lot of them: at least 3 handfuls per day. Selenium-rich foods Brazil nuts Consume 1 to maximum 2 Brazil nuts per day. Important: - Brazil nuts contain high amounts of selenium, in the proper forms. This is preferred over taking selenium supplements. - Do not consume many Brazil nuts per day, given they contain very high amounts of selenium. - If you do want to take selenium supplements, take selenium yeast supplements and not selenium methionine supplements (in the morning, 100-150 ug of selenium per day). - Do not take more than 150 ug per day of selenium. Too much selenium can be unhealthy. Fish roe For longevity, it's important to consume lots of foods with high amounts of omega-3, like fatty fish, walnuts, flax seed, and chia seeds. We, however, also recommend consuming daily, or at least a few times per week, fish roe such as herring roe, salmon roe, and/or lumpfish roe. These are high in a specific form of omega-3, namely lysophosphatidylcholine-based (LPC) omega-3. This form is especially important for brain health. Learn more about fish roe and omega-3s [here](https://novoslabs.com/what-are-the-best-omega-3-supplements-a-guide/). Potassium salt Use potassium salt (potassium chloride) instead of regular salt (sodium chloride) on food. Important: - Many people do not consume sufficient amounts of potassium. Use therefore salt consisting of around 66% to 85% potassium chloride and the remainder being sodium chloride (classic salt). - Salt consisting of very high levels of potassium chloride (>85%) tends to taste bitter but would be even healthier. - \"Pink Himalayan salt\" and similar salts are not \"healthy\" alternatives given they still mainly contain (>98%) classic salt (sodium chloride). - If you suffer from serious kidney disease, please consult your health practitioner first before taking extra potassium. Examples (not sponsored): [LoSalt](http://www.losalt.com/us/product/introducing-losalt/): on food. Fasting Fast at the start of every season (every 3 months) for 3 days. Important: - During fasting, drink plenty of water and also white or green tea. - Take 3 tablespoons of caprylic acid (in the morning, at noon, and in the evening) and electrolytes (potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium) during fasting to prevent too much muscle breakdown, and to reduce stress on the heart muscle and on the nervous system: - Calcium: 2 x 500 mg per day, in the morning and in the evening. - Magnesium malate: 2 x 2,000 mg, once in the morning and once in the evening (note: the 2,000 mg dosage is for magnesium malate, not magnesium). - Potassium salt (containing 66 percent potassium chloride and 33 percent sodium chloride): 2 x 2,000 mg, once in the morning and once in the evening. Learn more about the proper way to fast [here](https://novoslabs.com/best-fasting-method-for-longevity-and-health-and-weight-loss/). Caloric restriction Instead of 3 meals, consume two meals per day. Caloric restriction has been shown to slow down aging and drastically reduce the risk of various diseases. In between (as a replacement for a meal), consume nuts, as they quickly suppress hunger. Meal timing Ideally, consume most of your foods early in the day (like in the morning or around noon). The body can progress macronutrients (carbs, fats, and protein) best early in the day. Studies show that consuming the same amount of calories earlier in the day is significantly healthier than later in the day (learn more here). Avoid eating a (heavy) meal in the evening. Try to not eat at least 4 hours before going to bed. Avoid diets Most diets are unhealthy, especially in the long term. High-protein diets accelerate aging (learn more [here](https://novoslabs.com/why-high-animal-protein-carnivore-diets-accelerate-aging/)). Many diet foods and drinks are composed of bad macronutrients (fats, protein, and carbs) and [ inadequate micronutrients](https://novoslabs.com/best-food-supplements-to-take-even-when-you-eat-healthy/) (e.g. synthetic vitamins, missing vitamins, etc.). C. Prescription drugs Some [longevity hackers](https://novoslabs.com/what-are-longevity-hackers/) take prescription medications for longevity and to improve their health. However, there is the risk of side-effects, and at this point in time there have not yet been done long-term studies (clinical trials) in humans testing specific prescription drugs for longevity. Below is a list of the most common prescription drugs taken by longevity hackers and health enthusiasts. - Metformin: 2 to 3 x 500 mg per day, 20 min before the biggest meals of the day - Acarbose: 25 mg before each meal - Rapamycin: 2 mg every 5 to 7 days - Selegiline: 1 mg per day - Low-dose aspirin: 80 mg per day Are prescription drugs better than supplements for anti-aging? We explain more [here](https://novoslabs.com/natural-ingredients-versus-drugs-to-slow-down-aging/). We go deeper into metformin for longevity [here](https://novoslabs.com/metformin-versus-other-anti-aging-supplements/). D. Exercise Exercise daily for at least 30 min. Do the following types of exercise: - Aerobic exercise: fast walking, running, cycling, swimming, dancing, fencing, etc. - Anaerobic exercise: weight lifting, climbing. - Stretching (e.g., Pilates). - Buy a smartwatch that can track your daily activities and exercises (e.g., Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch). - Find YouTube videos with exercise coaches you can do exercises with. - Download exercise apps on your smartphone. - Get a fitness subscription. E. Sleep Sleep and a regular rhythm are very important for optimal health and longevity. - Get to bed at the same hour, ideally before midnight. - Get enough sleep: Try to sleep around 8 hours. - Wear blue-light blocking glasses 30 min. before sleep. - Try to walk outside for at least 20 min. in the morning. If not possible, wear blue-light-emitting glasses after waking up. - Take supplements that improve sleep and are also healthy, like extended-release melatonin (750 ug), calcium (500 mg), magnesium (300 mg), and valerian extract. We listed 50 tips to sleep better [here](https://novoslabs.com/tips-to-sleep-well-sleep-better-fall-asleep-faster/). F. Relaxation Stress accelerates and shortens lifespan. It's important to regularly relax and reduce stress in your life as much as possible. - Follow meditation courses. - Follow yoga courses. - Use meditation apps, like [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com)or [Calm](https://www.headspace.com). - Buy meditation and relaxation devices. - Practice mindful breathing. - Engage in self-hypnosis by listening to specific autosuggestions to better deal with depressive thoughts, anxiety, etc. - Find a good psychologist to help and support you, also when you are feeling psychologically healthy. - Try to do more outdoor walks, ideally in nature or parks. - Get a pet.
