If neutrophils predominate in periportal inflammation, a course of antimicrobial therapy in addition to pentoxifylline and vitamin E would be reasonable. If there is no clinical and serum biochemical improvement in 2 weeks and there is evidence of biliary obstruction (\\625% of bilirubin is conjugated bilirubin), then ur- sidiol (10 mg/kg PO every 24 hours) treatment could be added. If brosis is judged to be moderate to severe on ultrasound or biopsy, colchicine (0.03 mg/kg PO every 24 hours) could be used to inhibit or even diminish brosis. Colchicine is an alkaloid derived from treating hepatic collagen synthesis along with anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory ef- fects. 227 Colchicine should not be used if PA toxic- ity is suspected or if megalohepatocytes are present, as it is known to inhibit mitosis, as do PAs. There is one report of fatal bone marrow suppression in a horse being treated for chronic active hepatitis with colchicine. 228 Silymarin, a standardized extract of the milk this- tle seeds (Silybum marianum) is commonly used in the treatment of chronic liver diseases in several species including the horse. 229,230 Flavonolignans are the most common class of compounds present in milk thistle extract, and of the group, silybin (silib- inin) is considered to have the most hepatoprotective properties. 229,230 The percentage of silybin was found to be quite variable among commercial milk thistle extract products. Experimental studies have demonstrated antibrotic, antioxidant, and metabolic effects of silybin but human studies have been insufcient in conrming the clinical efcacy in chronic liver disease. 229 In normal horses, a stan- dard bioavailability study of orally administered silibinin found less than 1% available. 125 SAMe is another nutritional supplement commonly used in the treatment of chronic liver disease in small ani- mal veterinary medicine. SAMe is a compound made primarily in the liver as a byproduct of methi- onine metabolism. Following oral administration, absorption, and trans-sulfuration, SAMe is con- verted into glutathione, a powerful antioxidant. SAMe is believed to stabilize cell membranes, pro- mote secretion of bile, and has anti-inflammatory properties. Despite these potentially favorable benets and information to suggest that SAMe syn- thesis is depressed in chronic liver disease, high- quality randomized studies to demonstrate clinical efcacy were not found. 232 There are no studies on bioavailability or efcacy in the horse. If the inflammatory reaction in the diseased liver is more lymphocytic than neutrophilic then immu- nomodulatory therapy with corticosteroids or aza- thioprine can be used. In some horses with chronic liver disease and a mononuclear inflammatory re- sponse, treatment with 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone for 5-7 days followed by a tapering dose of dexa- methasone or switching to prednisolone has resulted in clinical and laboratory improvement for several months in several cases that I have treated, and a few cases have had a full recovery. Nutritional support for chronic liver disease is extremely impor- tant and some guidelines are found on page 95. One nutritional recommendation for chronic liver disease that has recently changed is that protein intake in patients with chronic liver disease should not be reduced unless HE is present. In years past, the traditional recommendation for nutritional sup- port in cases of chronic liver disease was to feed a low-protein diet. 233 Prognosis for chronic, active liver disease in horses can often be determined by clinical and se- rum biochemical response to therapy. 22,147,234 -236 Quantitative assessment of hepatic function using 99mTc-mebrofenin could be performed but studies in horses with liver disease are not available. 237 Prior to therapy, the degree of brosis and level of serum bile acids can be used as prognostic indicators. 22 8. Hepatic Encephalopathy HE is a neurologic disorder associated with liver failure. HE is common in horses with either acute or chronic liver failure, and in foals with portosys- temic shunts. Primary hyperammonemia syn- dromes in horses also have clinical and laboratory ndings (increased ammonia) similar to HE. The pathophysiology of HE is complex, and likely in- volves several gut-derived neurotoxins, cerebral and systemic inflammation, cerebral vascular dysfunction, and neuroendocrine abnormalities. 238,239 High con- centrations of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ammonia have been most commonly incriminated as causing the pathophysiologic events of HE. 240 Am- monia (NH 3,unionized and a weak base) is toxic at high concentrations and believed to easily pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by diffusion while the rel- atively nontoxic ionized ammonia (NH 4fl ) is limited to a transcellular route for translocation. Ammo- nia is produced mainly within the gut during protein digestion and amino acid deamination and the con- centration of ammonia in the blood is regulated by the urea cycle in the healthy liver. Therefore, liver failure often leads to hyperammonemia in both blood and CSF. 240 Astrocytes normally use ammo- nia when synthesizing glutamine from glutamate, but excessive ammonia presented to astrocytes can disrupt the equilibrium. 241 Ammonia is believed to play a key role in the development of HE, with increased glutamine, effects of varying amounts of glutamate and neurosteroids on N-methyl-D- aspartate receptor activity, all playing a central role in ammonia metabolism and HE. 241 Increased am- monia metabolism by brain astrocytes results in accumulation of glutamine, which is known to dis- rupt water balance in the brain leading to cytotoxic edema. 238,241,242 Increased ammonia concentra- 92 2015fiVol. 61fiAAEP PROCEEDINGS FRANK J.
