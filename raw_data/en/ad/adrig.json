Introduction Let me refresh your m emory conce rning DARPA's strategic plan. D ARPA's m ission cont t o be to act as the techn ical en abler for rad ical in novation for national security. We a re pursuing th ree m ain m ission areas that have e ndured since D ARPA's founding in 1958, even as individual techn ologies change . DARPA's e nduring mission lutions Nationa l-Level Pro blems. The Ag ency's p riority is on problems that may impact our national survival. To be the technical ena bler for th e innovation required fo r our warfighters to ac hieve dominance acros s the range of military op eration s - Operational Dominance. To develop and exploit high-risk Core Tech nologies for our Natio n's defense. In the a rea of National-Level Prob lems, DARPA's programs are f ocused on biological war fare defense a nd information assu rance and su rvivability. Th e biological warfare defense effo rt is d eveloping therapeutics countermeasur es, a dvanced sens ors, advanced diagnostics, ai r an d wat er purification devices, and genetic sequencing codes for potential b iological th reat ag ents. In the area of in formation assu rance and survivability, DARPA is developing techno logies to raise strong barriers a gainst cy ber attac k and provide c ommanders with mechanism s to see, c ounter, tolerate and survi ve sophisticated cybe r atta cks. DAR PA invests a pproxim ately 15 percent of its an nual budget in this mission area. In the area of ena bling Operational Dominance , DARPA i s invest ing in technologies and sy stems for affordable, precisio n moving targ et kill for bo th offensive and defen sive missio ns and dynamic comman d and control cap abilities fo r mobile n etworks and near-real-tim e logistics plan ning and replanning. Other programs include techno logies and system s that will en able future warfare con cepts for air, space, lan d and sea. We b elieve that one key to Operation al Domin ance w ill be co mbined man ned and unman ned operations - this will g ive the future U.S. m ilitary an overwhelming edge. Our inv estments in advanced, h igh-speed networks, complex syste m design and op eration, w ireless co mmu nicatio ns, micro circuits th at co mbine in formation technologies a nd biological syste ms, and other a reas, will enable t he U.S. to c onduct successful com bined m anned and unmanned military o perations. Prov iding this tech nical ed ge is th e key to our involvement with the Arm y in devel oping F uture Combat Systems (FC S). Our vision for FC S is revolutionary - a n etwork-centric land wa rfare syste m of systems composed of manned and unmanned nodes. It will g ive the U.S. a cap ability th at no other nation possesses. Our Unmanned Combat Air Vehi cle (UCAV) programs are an other example of o ur Ope rational Dom inance invest ments. We are working jointly with the Air Force and t he Na vy to develop autonomous unmanne d systems that will b e able to work with manned aircraft to effec tively and afford ably sup press en emy air d efenses, and for th e Navy, also conduct surveillance missio ns. With these syste ms, the U.S. will b e able to use an unmanned aircraft for dangerous operations rath er than put pilots at risk. The unmanned system will o perate au tonomously with in the rules of engagement, in associatio n with man ned aircraft, to prosecute its mission. It will n ot be fire an d forget - humans will main tain command and control through out the mission, and th e vehicle w ill retu rn to base to be used again. This will tru ly be a revo lutionary capab ility. The U.S. also must have Operational Dominance in space. The Orbital Expre ss program is developing technologies to allow the auto nomous rendezv ous, refu eling and repairing of satellites on-orbit. Th is will g ive us unprecede nted abilities to upgrade our space-base d assets. Approximately 40 perce nt of our annual budget is invested in the Operational Dominance mission area. 2DARP A's Core Technology investments include information technology, microsy stems techn ologies, materials technologies, m icro-electrom echanical system s, beyond s ilicon com plementary m etal oxi de semiconduct or technologies, op toelectron ics, sensors, and actuators. It is t he resu lts of all of these investmen ts that will allo w DoD to build system s and capab ilities fo r future operatio nal dominance. In addition, investm ents in th ese core areas prov ide DAR PA with a unique outreach into commercial and dual-use technology. DARPA's invest ments in inform ation techn ologies will provide informatio n superiority to the DoD th rough revolutionary adva nces i n embedded a nd autonomous systems performance c comm unications; and age nt-base d system In DARPA is inves tigating chi p-scale microsyste m technologi es that integrat e the core ogies of electronics, photonics micro-electrom This ew ortun revolutionize an miniaturize co mmunicatio ns, targ eting and analytical syste ms, as well as se nsors. DAR PA invests approximately 40 percent of its annual budget in the Core Tech nology mission area. I will now go into more detail ab out DARPA's i nvestments in curren tly o ngoing and planned programs. Th e Depa rtment is in the middle of a st rategy review an d a Quadre nnial Defense Review. As these re views com plete, we may propose ch anges to some of the details o f these efforts. So , with that understan ding, I'll lau nch into an overview of our programs. Technical Soluti ons t o Nation al-Level P roblems DARPA's is h igh-risk, high-payoff military techn ologies to enable operational dominance, a nd avoid technological surprise. In today 's world of em erging asymmetric and transnation al threats, our concern focuses on two principal national security issues: protection from biological warfare attack a nd protectio n from inform ation attack . \"We will work to defen d our pe ople and our all ies against gro wing threats: the threats of missiles; informati on w arfare; the threats of biol an d weapons . . . We will be creatin g the mil itary of the future, one that takes full adv antage revol --President Bush, Janu ary 26, 20 01 PROTECTION FROM BIOLOGICAL WARFARE ATTACK A clear and growing national security n eed is protectio n of ou r military fo rces fro m biological warfare at tack by both military and terrorist organizations. DAR PA's goal is to deter or thwart su ch attack s with a Bi ological W arfare Defe nse thrust foc used on sensors, medical diagnostics and c ountermeasure s, air and water purification, pat hogen genet ic sequencing, building protection, and consequence managem ent. Sensors To detect the presence of a threat agent, DARPA is investing in the development of adva nced Bio Sensor s that are ro bust, au tonomous, fast, an d sen sitive to multiple biological wa rfare a gents. D ARPA's mass spect rometer hol ds the promise of extraordinarily fast an d robust identificatio n of al l known biological warfare pathogens. The first-generation prototype was eval uated in field trials last year a gainst simulants; based on these trials as well a s other techno logy development, we are n ow making desi gn and e ngineeri ng m odifications to develop a rob ust and automated identification an d detectio n cap ability u sing time-o f-fligh t mass sp ectrometry. Th e program is also devel oping a nucleic-aci d-based microarray sensor to integrate and automate DNA/RNA isolation, labeling, and hybridization procedures into a single platform. The program has al ready developed a first- gene ration sen sor designed to determine whether ant hrax is prese nt, to enabl e fast separation of hoaxes from real threats. We are ev aluating the sen sor's performance th is year for po ssible tran sition to a number of partners, and we devel oping an improved, hierarc hical sensor in FY 2002. 3Another part of th e sensor program is investigati ng whether it is possible to build sensors around cells or pieces of tissu e to alert u s to the presen ce of a toxi c environm ent. These Tissue Ba sed Bio logical Senso r (TBBS) sy stem s use t he physiological response of biological cells and t issues to detect biological or chemical threats. The TBBS program is fabri cating new devices base d on high-density microarray s to detect the presence of engineere d agents (or as-y et uni dentified thre ats) fo r which there are no antibodies or g enetic seq uences. We con structed laboratory prototypes in FY 2000, including an integrated chi p microarray that incorporates live r tissue and measure s liver respon se following exposure to biological agents an d ch emical to xins. We then took hand-held syste ms that incorporate electrically active cells into the field at the U.S. Marine Corps base at Twe ntynine Palms, CA, and tested portable life su pport systems to provide on-site sup port for these syste ms. In F Y 2001, we are continuing devel opment of thes e system s to sc reen them agai nst a wide r list of ch emical and biological th reats and to determine the limits of sensitivity, false alarm rates, and the effects of in terferran ts. The Metabolic plements TB BS efforts. It is invest igating biological practices that allow organisms to adapt to environm ental extremes and is using those p ractices to engi neer new cellular s ystems such as platelets and red blood cells. In FY 2000, MECS research ers d emonstrated dramatic improvements in the stab ility o f cells by genetically en gineering them to increase their resistan ce to drying for storage. In FY 2001, the program is designing and testing cell and tissu e systems that reliab ly report on viral and bacterial exposures and i nvestigating key sensor featu res to m inimize false p ositives and maximize sig nal stren gth. Medical Diagnostics an d Countermeasures In th e event of a biological at tack, the U.S. will n eed to iden tify tho se who have been exposed to a bio logical warfare ag ent and to distinguish them from th e \"wo rried well,\" as well as fro m th ose with natural d iseases th at might require different treatment. The refore, identifying disease m arkers that can serve as rapid indicators of expos ure is one of the focus areas of the Advanced Medical Diagnos tics program. One group at Stanford University is l ooking for genetic mark ers by testin g human cell cu ltures exposed to a vari ety of infect ious disease agent s and other stimuli. In FY 2000, the researche rs identified a num ber of human ge nes that are selectively turned on or off in response to infection, a nd in FY 2001, they are testing for these m arkers in clinical settings suc h as hospitals. An other activ ity in this program is identifying mark ers in breath that may be used to determin e who has been expo sed to a potential path ogen. In FY 2001 , the pro gram identified specific biochemical markers using non- invasi ve m ass spectrosc opy that can provi de critical inform ation from breath sa mples. Future studies will look for these m arkers in breath in models of pathogen expo sure (in model syst ems). In FY 2001, we made sign ificant progress in establishing diagnostic detection equipment based on antibod y detection of pathogens. The program transitioned this ti me-reso lved fluorescen ce tech nology to the Centers for Disease C ontrol, and it is now being validated fo r use in public health facilities; the system has been tested against a number of biological p athogens. Rapid sequ encing techn iques also progressed sign ifican tly in FY 2001, and the pro gram is transition ing results to the private sect or for further development. The Unconventional P athogen Countermeasures (UPC ) program pa thogens. This includes an ti-viral and antibiotic drug discovery an d development as well as vaccinations. Three UPC projects, plant -based vaccine product ion, optim opment ded nitial DARPA expe riments, and we are tran sitioning them to the U.S. Army Med ical Research Institute for In fectious Diseases (USAMRIID) fo r furth er development. In additio n, the U.S. Army Institute for Su rgical Research, Fo rt Sam Houston, is ev aluating skin deco ntamination by nanoemulsion techn ology. In FY 2001, we anticipate transitioning other successes t o USAMRIID, i ncluding novel antibiotic therapeutics, a ntibiotic target methodologies, and novel DNA vaccines a nd platform s. A nove l vaccine enha ncer developed under the UPC program is lik ely to tran sition to the Cen ters for Disease Con trol or USAMRIID later th is year. By FY 2002, we expect to have additio nal programs ready for transition including vaccine candidates , novel enzym e antibacter ial thera peutics, and new a pproaches to usi ng computers to a ccelerate the proce ss of discovering therapeut ics. Building Protection In addition to the component tech nologies, DARPA is developing complete syste ms solutions to counter th e biological wa rfare thr eat. T he goal of the Immune Buildi ng program, which is just getting underway in FY 2001, is to make military b uildings far less attractiv e targets fo r attack by chemical o r biological warfare ag ents by 4reducing the effectiv eness o f such attack s via activ e and passive resp onse of heatin g, ventilatio n and air infrastru filtra tion, etc.). This am bitious go al can on ly be achieved through a combination of techn ology devel opment and systems-level experimentation. The program is leveraging earlier efforts i n these technol ogies - for example, decont aminating foams and novel materials that can be used for both chemical and biological filtratio n - and ex tending them for use in this app licatio n. Th e program is also devel oping new com ponent techn ologies specifically ication, such as new gase ous decontamination techniques that can follow the c ontaminant into t he sm all, inaccessi ble spaces withi n buildi ngs, spec ialized low- pressure-d rop filtratio n for use at return vents, and high-efficien cy/lon g-lifeti me sources o f ultraviolet radiation for on-the-fly neutralization o f agents. In addition, se veral industry teams are eval uating candi date architectures for building protection sy stems. In F Y 2002, the program will test successful techn ologies and prototypes as part s of complete p rotectio n system s, and we will evalu ate the most promising arch itectu res exp erimentally at fu ll scale, as a first step in the design of \"optimal\" prot ection systems. Air And Water Purifica tion Clean air an d water are cru cial to the sustained operatio n of our Military Serv ices in the ev ent of a biological and chem ical warfare attack. To-date, our program in Air and W ater Purification has d emonstrated encouraging results. Warfighters m ust be able to obtain po table wate r quickly - their wat er purification devices a nd beverage containers must be integrated in order to work and pack away toget her. One project, t he New Ge neration Hydration System , will p roduce m icrobiologically safe d rinking water and beverages from sources of un known quality an d will provide an efficient storage and delivery system for hands-free, on-the-move hydration. One of the program's key design objectives is to be abl e to purify all av ailab le wat er sou rces in the field, including desa linating seawater. We plan to meet this requi rement by devel oping a forward osmosis membrane. The ciple ex periments showing techn ical feasib ility. During the remainder of this year, t he program is optimizing the compone nts of the system, e.g., i ncreasi ng the wat er flux through the membrane and d emonstrating rem oval of volatile o rganic compounds and other harmful contamin ants fro m the water. In FY 2002, the program will make the system more rug ged and will in tegrate th e forward osmosis compone nt with a standard m ilitary hydration bag (such as a Cam elback). The Mari ne C orps plans to t ransition DARP A's Ne w Gene ration Hy dration System as an official enha ncem ent program . The Ai r and Wat er Purification p rogram is also de veloping pi oneering app roaches for advanced gas mask filters. To day's masks have higher-th an-desirab le breath ing resistan ce, and their cap acity (th e period of time they effectively filter) is li mited. Recently, we have dem onstrat ed the proof-of-principle that microfibrous c arriers m ake better use of c arbon to adsorb chem ical agents and that th ey accom plish this with an inherent pa rticulate filtration capability. For th e next two years, our work is aim ed at re ducing the pressure dro p by at least a facto r of two over current C2A1 canisters, wh ile m aintaining the equivalent period of time the filters op erate effectiv ely. PROTECTION FROM INFORM ATION ATTACK The Un ited States p ossesses li mited capabilities to protect ag ainst sophisticated cyb er attack s. Defend ing against distributed, coordinated attacks requi res t echn ology and infrastructure that com mercial industry is not developing. To address t his challen ge, DARPA in itiated the Third Generati on Security (3GS) suite of programs defe Defe nse De partment's adva nced information sy stems. The goal s of these programs are to rai se strong barriers to cyber attack and provide commanders with tech nology to see, cou nter, to lerate, and survive sop histicated cyber attacks. In FY 200 0, the 3G S suite of DARPA programs made significant progress to ward these goals. Th ese pr ograms: Devel oped and dem onstrated techniques to detect malicious c ode an d confine damage caused by mobile malicio us code; Identified survivability p rinciples to allow con tinued operations throug h a wide class of cyb er attack s; Devel oped distributed security techn ologies to overcome the limitations o f perimeter defense strategies (i.e., firewalls) ; 5 Devel oped intrusion det ection and correlation techniques to enable detection of certain kinds of stealthy network-based attacks and t o reduce t he overwhelming num bers of sec urity alerts that operat ors fac e by recogn izing actio ns that are part of si gnificant multi-step attack scen arios; and Devel oped modeling techniques to determine h ow the effects of at tacks or defensive resp onses m ight impact th ility to perform mission-critical fu nctions. In FY 2001, the 3G S programs are integrating evolving security tech nologies to achiev e automatic defense, assess correlated attacks, achieve pre liminary situ ation understan better assessm ents of damage and co ntainment, and develop a har dened core. DAR PA is using experimentation an d techn ology transition partnerships with operational commanders to evaluate these advanced defensive techn ologies and transitio n them to warfi ghters. Also this year, con ceptual system definition studies will b egin to apply the results of the 3GS program s to m ake th e DoD's Global Inform ation Grid (GIG) m ore survi vable in the face of cyber attack s. In FY 2002, the suite o f programs will u se previous system concept studies to design both a surv ivable prototype of an exem plar GIG system and a Cyber Pa nel for monitor and control. Next year, t he program will: Dem onstrate the ab ility o f mission-critical syste ms to operate through cyber attack s; Develop a new fam ily of protocols resilien t to both serv ice denial an d traffic an alysis; Devel op techniques for detecting and correlating disturbances acro ss large n etwork s to allow respon se to wides pread attacks i n real time; and Devel op and demonstrate tools for sel ecting and car rying out collective defe nsive act ions i n response to correlated cy ber attacks. Enabling Operational Dominance DARPA is the technical enabler for the revo lutionary innovation requ ired for our warfigh ieve Operational Dominance - d ominance acr oss the range of military operat ions. DARPA is emphasi zing development of tech d syste ms to enable affo rdable, precisio n, moving targ et kill fo r both offensive and defensive missio ns. We are also developing techno logies an d systems to provide dynamic co mman d and control cap abilities to our com mande rs, including the advanced com munications a nd m obile networking techn ologies necessary for assured commu nication s and in formation superiority. O ther programs focus on techno logies to allow planning and replanning in near-real-tim e. Lastly, DAR PA is inv esting heavily in tech nologies and system s that will en able future warfare conce pts for combined manned and unmanne d operations , and operations i n spac e, on land, at sea and in the air. AFFORDABLE , PRECI SION, MOVING TARGET KILL Current approa tim e-critica l surface m oving targets include area-of-effect munitions and m an- in-the-loop targeting. These approaches traditionally in volve large, very ex pensive weap ons, the potential fo r larg e collateral d amage, and, often , the requiremen t to put the warfighter in harm's way . DAR PA is responding by devel oping low-cost, highly capabl e weap ons net worked t o a variety of airborne sen sors for offensive and defensive missions, ad vanced se nsors c apable of detecting targets hidden in foliage, and cam ouflage an d broadband antennas that can be electronically reconfigure d. The Affor dable Moving Sur face T arget E ngage ment (AMSTE) program is devel oping technologies to make it feasi ble and practical for the warfighter to preci sely, rapidly, and affordably engage individual moving surface vehicles. The program will dem onstrate that, without expensive modifications t o existing an d planned systems, networked sen sors a nd wea pons ca n be integrated to provide robust, precise standoff engagem ent of m oving surface targets. In FY 2000, t he AMSTE progra m completed a se ries of we apon system trade studies that eval uated AMSTE c ompone nt architectures, devel oped and performed real-time laboratory experiments to asses s the acc uracy and robustness of fire con trol algorithms using radar data collected from multiple airborne sensors, and completed detailed system designs of an experimental AMSTE system. These stu dies demonstrated the feasib ility of the AMSTE con cept and identified orting technolo gies requiring further development and matu ration. In 6FY 2001, the AMSTE pr ogram awarded tw o con tracts, to Northrop Grumman Corp. Integrated Systems Sect or (Melbourne, FL) and to Rayth eon System Co. (El Segund o, CA ), to dev elop and assem ble prototype AMSTE expe rimental systems (rep resentative radar sensors, data links, and weap ons) for live flight experimentation. At the end of t his year, a series of developmental fli ght experiments will cu lminate in the delivery o f GPS-gu ided precision weap ons agai nst moving vehicles, targeted by standoff networked sensors using AMSTE p recision fire co ntrol techniques. Furth er exp erimentation with the AMSTE system is planned for FY 2002, and the program will d evelop and i ncorporate cri tical enhancem ents to address hi gh-confidence track m aintenance i n highly cluttered environments. The Advanced Tactic al Targeting Technology (AT3) program is devel oping and dem onstrating technologies that will radic ally improve today 's capa bility to target surface-t o-air missile (SAM) threats through t he use of networked, next-generation electronic support measures s ystems. AT3 enabl es the rapid and acc urate targeting of precision-guided wea pons to counter t he modern, m ore capable enem y SAM syste ms, whic h are using inc reasingly sophisticated tactics su ch as early emitter sh utdown, making them particularly ch allen ging targ ets. In FY 2000, the program successfu lly co mpleted initial so ftware algo rithm development, non-real-tim e flight tests, test data an alysis, and a c ritical desi gn re view. The data collections focused on a few critical issu es: platform-to-platform deco rrelation from electronically or m scanned systems, multipath, and geolocation performance. Usi ng realistic e mitters, w e condu cted these tests w ith a co mbination of leg acy h ardware, new AT3 hardware, and off-th e- shelf navigation s olutions, a nd all technical objectives were achieve d. The succes sful conclusi on of the tests laid the foundation for our continuing development work in AT3. DAR PA has sel ected Raytheon Defense Sy stems Company (Tucson , AZ) to conduct th e program's seco nd p hase. Thi s year, t he program is fabri cating AT3 test hardware, conducting h ardware-in-the-loop and ground tests, and con tinuing software algorithm development. In FY 2002, the program will com plete real- time flig ht tests of the AT3 packages ag ainst real threats, an alyze th e test data, and continue software algorithm devel opment based on the collected flight-test data. A new generation of co llection syste ms will provide dram atically increased volumes of high-fidelity d ata to the operation al decisio n-maker. The challeng e will b e to manage and synchronize th ese ad vanced collectio n syste ms with task ing, processing , exploitatio n, and disse mination capabilities to provide critical in formation in a con stantly chan ging operational situation. T he (AI M) program is providing th e tech nical foundation for ISR supp ort through the development of an automated syste m to optimize the task ing of ISR assets t o meet users' needs. The AIM program is developing and advancing tech nologies in areas of multi-no de collabo ration , sem i-automated reaso ning, and math ematica l programmin g. The resulting AIM cap abilities will tran sition to DoD auto mated planning and comma nd, con trol, communications, c omputers systems as appr opriate. In FY 2001, the AIM program is installin g the Mu lti-Asset Syn chronizer at th e U.S. Southern Command to particip ate in Exercise Unified End eavor. AIM is providing enh anced co ordination and visualizatio n of m ultiple diverse co llection assets, en abling collection managers to assess th e utility of the techn ology and to provide valuable feed back to gu ide furth er development. In FY 2002, AIM cap abilities will b e further ex tended to p rovide near-real-tim e re-task ing of asset s to resp ond to contingencies and to maximize ex ploitation system product value. The goal of the DARPA Counter Cam ouflage, Conce alment, and Deception (Counter CC&D) program is to an d demonstrate a fo liage pe netration (FOPE N) synthetic apert ure ra dar (SAR) to provide the war fighter with all-weather, day/night cap ability to detect targ ets hidden by foliage and cam ouflage. In FY 2000, the FOPEN SAR was i nstalled on an Army RC-12 ai rcraft, and the program conducted prelimin ary flig ht tests t o validate th e real-time im age fo rmation so ftware a nd verify that the system coul d provide the required i mage resol ution and sensitivity. This year, th e FOPEN SAR has demonstrated excellen t image quality in the VHF and UHF bands and will co mplete t he preliminary RC-1 2 fligh t tests b y imaging vehicles h idden under foliage at Ca mp Nav ajo, AZ, to estab lish the cap change-detection algo rithms. In FY 2002, the RC-12 FOPEN SAR will fly an extensi ve series of flights to co llect th e data necessary to train , test, refine and validate algorithms in differe nt foliage environments. Th e program will also cond uct experiments to determine the ability o f FOPEN SAR to perform terrain mapping and terrain characterization. The Symbi otic Communic ations program will er airbo rne sy ape rture rada ages, ve ry accurate (National Im agery and Ma pping Agency level four) terrai n height m aps, cat egorize terrain (for e xample trees ve rsus roads), a nd dete ct and locate slowly m oving ground ve hicles. This system is a passi ve, bistatic recei ver, m aking it difficult for a dversaries to 7detect and c ounter the system . This approach will allow our warfighters to gathe r the battlespace data they need without putting themselves at risk. In FY 2001, an expert Government team and two contractor team s will d evelop syste m concepts an d ground-based experiments to validate tech nical feasib ility and to refin e performance predictions. In FY 2002, the two contractor t eams will co nduct early fligh t tests, ach ieve radar pro cessing of si gnals of interest, and dem onstrate bistatic aperture radar processi ng. DAR PA is conce rned a bout the threat of at tack b y large num bers o f low-cost air vehi cles - fr om unsophisticated cruise missiles to small fixed-wing aircraft. Thi s asym metric threat can em erge ver y quickly, and there are m any ways an adve rsary can acquire such a t hreat, e.g., m anufact uring them indigenously, importing them from cou ntries, or conv erting existing assets. In itiated in 1996, the goal of the Low Co st Cruise M issile Defe nse (LCC MD) program is to develop a viable, affo rdable op tion for countering such an attack without reso rting to our current inventory of intercept ors (designed for far more sop histicated threats) and running the risk of being overwhelmed by shee r numbers of attacking platforms. The LC CMD program is devel oping and dem onstrating affordable seek ers for use on a low -cost intercept or system . Seekers represe nt approximately two -third s the cost of a typical interc eptor system . Last year , the program conducted laboratory testing of a laser radar see ker and a novel microwa ve-frequency noise radar seeke r. In FY 2001, the program is conducting field-testing of the noise radar seeker and initiatin g developmen t of an affo rdable micro-electro mechanically switch ed electro nically scan ned array (MEMS ESA) seeker. In FY 2002, the program will co mplete a p reliminary d esign of the MEMS ESA seek er an d fabricate subas semblies of its antenna syste m. The U. S. Army Space and Missile De fense Comm and ha s expresse d great interest in this program, and has funded an effort this year to e valuat e low cost cruise missile defe nse options. The Real Ti me Battle Dam age Asses sment (RT-BDA) pr ogram is developing and dem onstrating new techniques to automate the assessm ent of target battle d amage. Th e program will use tactical an d theater syn thetic aperture radars co ordinated with weapon s deliv ery to image the targ ets before, du ring, and following th e strik e to enable imm ediate assessm ent of the strike effect iveness. This year t he program is cond ucting instrumented dat a collectio ns of real b attle d amage on realisti c targ ets to produce a database to supp ort fu rther research in signature exploitation techni ques. Th e pro gram is also invest igating imaging radar B DA phenomenology and rther mature these initial alg orithms to prov ide damage localizatio n and assess ment, and they will b e implemented and evaluated in a real-tim e laboratory system . The Global P ositioning E xperiments program address es the problem of enem y jam ming of t he Global Position ing Syste m (GPS). The prog ram will d emonstrate the use of airbo rne pseudolites, wh ich are h igh-power, GPS-like to broadcast GPS signa l and restores GP S navi gation over a theater of ope rations. T wo field dem onstrations last year show ed that signals broadcast from airborne pseudolites can be used in place of satellite broa dcasts to provi de good quality navi gation t o military GPS receivers with only softwa re m odifications to the receive rs. In FY 2001, the program is conducting laboratory an d field tests to demonstrate th at beamformer an tennas can protect th e airb orne pseudolite fro m jamming. In FY 2002, the program will c ombine these two key pieces of the concept by flying an aircraft in the presence of powerfu l jamming and demonstratin g the abilit y of a beamforming antenna to allow t he aircraft to acquire a satellite sig nal and reb roadcast it as a pseudolite. Preparations will also b egin for a m ultiple, airborn e psuedo lite d emonstration. DYNAMIC COMM AND AND CONTRO L One key aspect to operational dom inance is the ability of the commander to access critically needed inform ation and to control that inform ation dynamically. Info rmation technologies can provide this ability b y allowing disparate information syste ms and databases to interop erate quickly and efficiently. Ot her tec hnologies allow commanders to devel op operational plans quickly and revise their plans in near real-time to capture new information or counter an adversary's act ivities. Mo bile networking tech nologies are also important, as fu ture warfare con cepts envision small units a rmed with com prehensive knowle dge of the battle space a nd able to comm unicate while m aneuveri ng. The military has a unique need for com munications networks that can be formed an d reformed rapi dly without a fixed infrastructure, and t hat are hi ghly secure and resi stant to jamming; DARPA ha s a n umber of i nvestments in these areas. Othe r program s are focuse d on the a pplication of info rmation tech nology to the critical military ch allen ge of controlling and automating the lo gistics pipeline and planning process. 8Near-Real-Time Planning and Replannning Many rece nt studies agree t hat future U.S. a dversaries ar e unlikely to challen ge the U.S. d irectly. Rather, it is more lik ely th at they will presen t an asymme trical th reat, developing and using app roaches th at av oid U.S. streng ths and e xploit pot ential vulne rabilities rsaries ll attem pt to con ditions effectiv ely d elay, d eter, or co unter the app licatio n of U.S. m ilitary cap abilities. DARPA is undertaking high-risk research to help our military an d intellig ence ag encies id entify threats b efore attack s happ en. This will allow d eterren ce or deflectio n of unconventiona l but potentially d evastatin g attack s against o ur military forces a nd in frastructu re. T he DARP A Asymme tric Threat initiativ e will d evelop a su ite o f new technological capabilities to better detect, co rrelate, an d understand these asymmetric t hreats. The Hum an Identific ation at a Dis tance program beg an in August 2 000. In FY 2001, the Hu man Identificatio n at a Distan ce program is d eveloping automated multi-modal surveillance tech nology for id entifyin g humans at a distance using different biom etrics tec hniques suc h as face and body pa rts identification, infra red and hyper-spectral imagery , gait and t emporal hum an dy namics, non -imaging physiological base d-biometrics, and remote iris scan. In FY 2002, t he progra m will assess the capa bilities of each bi ometric to ident ify people at a distance. B ased on the assess ment, the program will further dev elop the most prom ising bi ometrics and i nvestigate ng the As ymmetric Envir onment (WA E) program will develop and demonstrate sp ecific predictive too ls to better an ticipate and act against terro rists. WAE is a rev ap proach to ictive indicators of terrorist-specific attacks an d beha viors by examining their past beha vior in the broad context of their political, cu ltural an d ideological en vironment. In itial resu lts demonstrate th e feasib ility of developing automated and adaptive behavior prediction m odels tuned to specific terrorist groups or individuals. It uses their past behaviors and the c onsequence s of thei r dee ds, as well as the a ntecedent activities that le d up to t he act, to predict what, when, where, how and why they will strike next . Over the past year, WAE developed a m odel able to predict an act ive terrorist group's next tactic (assa ult, bom bing, assa ssination, hijacking, or n o attack). The model was val idated against archival data co vering 66 attack s over 17 year s. In FY 2001 , WAE is exp anding its pr edictive model and validation process to increase th e lev el of detail fo r predictions of target characte ristics, tim efram es, geographical locatio n, and motivating factors. In FY 2002, WAE will extend its p redictiv e model development and validation to include other group s and ind ividuals; th ese models will th en be used to dev elop an intervention-testin g env ironment. The Evidence Extr action and Link Discovery (EEL D) program will develop aut omated discovery, extraction and linking of sparse evi dence in larg e amounts of classified an d unclassified data sour ces. EELD is developin g detectio n capabilities to extract relev ant data an d relation ships abou t people, org anizatio ns, and activ ities fro m message t raffic and o pen source dat a. It will then link together related item s that co mprise p otential terrorist g roups or sce narios, and learn patterns of different groups or scenarios to identify new organizations or em erging threats. EELD's initial activities dem onstrated th e feasibility of extracting relations hips from text and validated t he detectab ility o f patterns represen ting terrorist g roups an d scenarios. EELD also d eveloped two promising techn iques for learni ng patterns o f activity, and de veloped functional system concept s to guide technology developments. In FY 2001, EELD will d evelop techn iques fo r evidence extr actio n, link disco very and pattern learn ing, v alidate the detectab ility o f patterns in classified data, and initiate collectio n and characterizatio n of d ocuments for techn ology evaluations. In FY 2002, EELD will evelop and demonstrate tech nology to extract relatio nships, and detect an d learn si ngle-link type patterns. Projec t Ge noa, in the process o f concluding, provides the structure d argum entatio n, deci sion-making a nd corporate memory to rapi dly deal with and ad just to dynamic cri sis managem ent. Pro ject Genoa is devel matica cumulate ev idence, facilitate collaboration while pro tecting critical in formatio n and test h ypotheses that su pport d ecision-making at th e national level. In FY 2000, Proj ect Geno a matured and tran sition ed a new \"the matic\" search engine to Intelink . nse Intellig h as agreed to be a tran sition partner for Project Genoa technology. In FY 2001, Genoa evi dence-accumulation com ponents are being delivered to the Office of the Secretary o f Defen se and Joint Staff Directorate for In tellig ence (J2), th e Joint Co unter- intellig ence Analysis Gro up, and U.S. Pacific Co mmand. In FY 200 2, these tran sition activities will b e completed . 9The Command Post of the Future (CPOF) program is devel oping tools that enable commanders to rapidly acqui re a dee p understand of any military situation, leading to faster and better deci sion making and m ore effective employment of m ilitary fo rces. In th e past year, CPOF has developed several p rototypes of the BattleBo ard, a mobile co mmand interface t hat provi des the commander with a visual int erface to s ubordinates, s uperiors, peers, and staff that significantly improves situation awareness and has demonstrated an order of magnitude reduction in time to plan while at th e same time improving the rob ustness of plans. In FY 20 01, CPOF is ex tending research into team collaboration tools and augmenting the co llaboration and visualizatio n tools in the BattleBo ard with reason ing tools t hat will provide t he commander with the a bility to attach in telligent m onitors t o places, objects, and tim es in the battlesp ace, effectiv ely u sing the BattleBo ard as an exten sion of his memory an d expertise. In FY 200 2, CPO F will ad d a d ialog system to the BattleBo ard providing the co mmander with rich er, mo re natural ways to query information in th e comman d and control syste m. Add itionally, CPOF will in tegrate the BattleBo ard in to existing Army and M arine Corps command and control systems. The Active Te mplate s program is devel oping and delivering cri tical com mand and co ntrol software tools for special ope rations forces (SOF). These t ools e nable c omma nders t o plan four times fast er, coordinate deci sions immediately, synchronize co mbined-arm s operat ions, and control resources that dictate the outcome of the figh t. In FY 2000, the t emporal plan e ditor and execution chec klist tool were tested success fully in thr ee SOF exercises and subsequ ently ad opted by a number of SOF or ganizatio ns. In FY 2001, DARPA is d eveloping a geo-spatial ed itor for p lanning and track ing SOF missions on a map or an imag e. In FY 2002, the program will u se default reason ing to develop a networked spreadsheet th at allows users t o coordinate information, get intellig ent assistan ce fo r decision -making, an d reu se solutions to similar p roblems solved in th e past. Advanced information technologies are being act ively applied to warfighter logistics support, making that support secu re, scalab le, and robust, an d to collaborative log istic an d operational planning and execution capabilities for the Global Combat Su pport System . The objective of the Advanced L ogistics Projec t (ALP) is to demonstrate th e feasi bility of using advanced agent -based technology to make a re volutionary improve ment in how the DoD provides logistics sup port to the warfigh ter. The Adv anced Logistics Pro ject is a joint DAR PA/Defense Lo gistics Age ncy effort , in partnership with the U.S. Transportation C ommand an d the Joint Staff Director for Logistics. The project has de veloped a di stributed syste ms tech nology that will rev olutionize dynamic p lanning, execu tion, and overall info rmation management of the DoD log istics enterprise. In FY 2000, the proj ect dram atically en hanced the arch itectu re to prov ide the capability to devel op and manage m ultiple concurrent logistics plans. The program wor ked with the Defe nse Age ncies an d Military Serv ices to identify hig h-payoff pilot p rojects an d developed several app lication s. One is operatio nal today at U.S. Transportation Command, and another is operating at the De fense Supply Center Columbus, a c ompone nt of the Defen se Logistics Ag ency, an d is sch eduled to go into full operat ion by late June. The p rogram concl udes this year h aving demonstrated a syste ms arch itectu re that has the cap ability to : generate an ite m-level logistics p lan in under an hour; totally co ntrol the transportation pipeline; co ntinuou sly g enerate ti me-phased su pport and sustain ment demands; monitor th e execution d etails down to the ind ividual ite ms against real-tim e informatio n from the real world; and dynam ically repair the pl an when necessary. If this te chnology we re fully fielded i n the m ilitary, it wo uld allow the military logistics en terprise to : gain control of the logistics p ipeline; en able the warfigh ter to project and sustain overwhelming com bat power sooner; perm it forces and materiel to be de ployed, t racked, sustained, an d redeployed more effect ively and ef ficiently with reduced reliance on l arge Do D inventories; provide users at an y lev el the ability t o effectiv ely interact du ring planning and execu tion; and, link operatio ns with logistics staff elem ents at all echelons. As an infrastru cture for global logistics, an operation al ALP cap ability wo uld truly enabl e Focused Logistics as envisioned in Joint Vision 2020. The Ultra*Log program is devel oping inform ation technol distribu ted, very ch aotic warti me conditions. Th is pro gram will build upon - and extend - the revolutionary technologies de veloped under the Advanced Logistics Pro ject in the areas of security, scalab ility an d robu stness to ensure istics su pport to the warfi ghter und er th e most ex treme kinetic and inform ation warfare conditio ns. If successful, this would se rve as a tem plate for c reating agent -based distributed command and co ntrol systems operating at all echel ons that coul d dynamically recover f rom inform ation attacks, i nfrastructure l oss, and other real-world problems that plague effective planning a nd control in com plex wartim e environments. In FY 2000, the program identified several critical su rvivability technology extensions such as adapt ive communications protocols, layered ce rtificate and e ncryption-based data securi ty, and techni ques for 10recovery from catastrophic inform ation loss, as well as th e processes for measuri ng and expe rimentally eval uating them. In FY 2001, the program is co ncentrating first on building the fou ndation for surv ivability in the core architecture to in clude secure in formation management, increased fault-toleran ce, an d syste m scalab ility. Th e p first larg e-scal e evalu ation and assessm ent in late 2001, to inclu de a Red Team attack of the log istics inform ation system during a representative Major Reg ional Contingency (MRC) scen ario. In FY 2002, the prog ram will fo cus on expanding the logistics in form ation syste m's cap ability t o detect threats and change syste m-state d ynamically in respon se to those threats. The military con cept of \"Th reatCo n\" will b e incorporated into the software ag ent arch itectu re to su pport dynamic reconfigu ration fo r enh anced su rvivability in increasing ly chaotic con ditions. In the program's seco nd major assessm ent in th e late 2002, the prototype system will atte mpt to detect various threats and failures and deploy appropriate counterm easure s during the represe ntative M RC scenari o. The prim ary them e of the Joint Theater Logistics Advanced C oncept Tech nology Dem onstration (AC TD) is logistic co mman d and con trol. Th e ACTD will lev erage current and emerging techn ology to produ ce, and rapidly transition, ad vanced co llaborativ e logistic and op erational p lanning and execution capabilities for th e Glob al Combat Su pport Syste m (GCSS). It will build a series of web-b ased Joint Theater Logistics Decisio n Support Tools that will en courage operation s and log istic co llabo ration during planning and requirements determin ation and execution t racking, a nd whi le realigni ng resources t o meet changing operation al situ ations. Th e Joint Theater Logistics ACTD will correct existing l ogistic deficiencies and provide the capa bilities necessary to e nsure t he future coordinated sustainability for logistic operations. This AC TD builds upon th e success of the Joi nt Dec ision Support Tools and technical architecture developed under the earlier Joint Logistics AC TD, and incorporates technologies from DAR PA's Advanced Logistics Project, the Command P ost of the Future, and other AC TDs targeted for Joint Task Force operations . The t arget use r for Joint Theater Lo gistics ACTD is at the operational level: th e Joint Task Force, its Service com pone nts, and major Service logistics organizations. In FY 2000, the Joint Theater Log istics ACTD cond ucted an initial d emonstratio n of co llaborative products, allowing operations an d logistic users, i n real-time via the web, t o coordinate shared conce pts for planning and execution. This effort i nclude d selection of c ombat and c ombat support forces, missions, locati ons, and time phasing. In FY 2001, the Joint Theater Lo gistics ACTD is demonstratin g the ability to collabo ratively develop operation al cou rses of action the corresp onding logistic supportab ility assess ments for fuel, eng ineer, and other commodities in a Jo int Task Force env ironment. In FY 2002, the ACTD will p rovide a lo gistic watch board capability to monitor and replan ongoing lo gistic op eratio ns in real-ti me, with flex ible visualizatio ns to provide rapid drilldown for assessm ent details. Th e Joint Theater Log istics ACTD p roducts will tran sition through the Defe nse Information Sy stems Agency i n FY 2003 as a Pilot Serv ice Pro gram, with expected fielding to GCSS in FY 2005. Mobile Networking Technologies The Airb orne unications Node (ACN) program is d eveloping a multi-mission payload that will simultaneousl y provide, in a single package, ass ured communications and radio frequency exploitation (signals intellig ence, el ectron ic warfare an d inform ation operation s) for joint and multinational forces on maneuver. The payload will be scalab le for application on a wid e rang e of platforms. It will en able high-bandwid th, beyond-lin e- of-sigh t conn ectiv ity an d will allo w the tactical co mman der to dynamically recon figure his av ailab le assets to satisfy changing mission priorities. In FY 2000 , the three co mpeting Phase I co ntractor team s demonstrated th eir architecture and proof-o f-concep t designs for AC N. Th e prog ram selecte d two team s to incorpo rate mu lti-mission functionality (e.g ., assu red communicatio ns and radio fre quency ex ploitatio n) into their arch itecture and begin development of th e techn ologies necessary to implement the multi-mission design. In FY 2001, the p rogram is demonstrating subsystem perf ormance t hrough detailed laboratory testing and sim ulation. In FY 200 2, the pro gram will v alidate mu lti-missio n functionality in an end-to-end n in a laborato ry env ironmen t. The Sma ll Unit Operatio ns Situation Aw areness Sy stem (SU O SAS) program is devel oping and integrating key com munications, navigation, and situational awareness technologies for use by light, early-entry forces in restrictive terrain where t hey curre ntly cann ot com municate. The program is technologies to enable warfighters to communicate clandest inely in buildings, tunnels, jun gles an d mountainous terrain using self-form ing, computer-controlled networks th at co ntinuou sly monitor the env ironment, mission needs and the tactical situ ation, and op timize t hemselves to ensure that commu nicatio ns are always m aintained. Th ese cap abilities will g reatly increase th e effectiv eness and survivability o f small, d ismounted forces. Last year, a series of con tractor labo ratory 11and field tests were highly successf ul in demonstrating SUO SAS' clandestine communications waveform and i ts non-GPS method f or preci sely locating sol diers inside b uildings. I n FY 2001, the program is com pleting the detailed hardware an d software desi gns, fabricating the major prototype compone nts, and integrating m easuri ng syste m-level rmance. co mplete p rototype-lev el field performance testin g and analysis, providing important measures o f the technological adva nces f or implementation by the Ser vices i n their communicatio ns and situation awaren ess sy stems. Tran sition details are cu rrently being discussed with the Arm y. The WolfPack program is devel oping new el ectronic warfare t that can hold enemy emitters (comm unications a nd radar) a t risk battlespace while avoidi ng di sruption of frie ndly military protected commercial radi o communications. The WolfPack concept emphasi zes an ai r-deployable, ground- based, cl ose proximity, distributed, networked architecture to obtain radio frequency spect rum dom inance . The WolfPack concept is to use a net work of nodes t o sense the radio frequency environment, ascert ain the type an d configuration of the threat, and ca rry out a preci se, c oordinated res ponse. That resp onse can ei ther be t o disable communications an d radar re ception, or to relay the geol ocation information of the threat transm itter. In FY 2000, a team made up of ntatives from governm ent, acad emia, and the WolfPac k conc ept a nd highlighted the critical areas of technology devel opment through a nalytical assessm ents of critical technology a nd perform ance tradeoffs. This year, the program is star ting development of high-risk, high-payoff techno logies su ch as wi deband antennas, precision geolocation techniques for urban terrain, spectrum deni al techniques for dense threat environments, and e xtremely s mall micro-jamm ers. The program is sel ecting com peting cont ractor team s to design the system archi tecture and develop critical com ponent technologies. I n FY 2002, the WolfPack program will finalize the system designs and con duct laborat ory and lim ited filed dem onstrations of compone nt technologies for network management and emitter n ode and network identificatio n, classificatio n and geolocation . \"On land, our heavy forces w ill be lighter, our light forces will be more letha l. All will be eas ier to depl oy and to sustain. In the air, we will be able to strike across the world with pinpoint accurac y, using both a ircraft and unma nned systems. On the ocea ns, we will conn ect inform ation a nd weapons i n new ways, maximizi ng our abilit y to project po wer over la nd. In space, we'll protect our net work of satellit es essential to the flow of our commerc e and the defens e of our common interests.\" --President Bush, Februar y 13, 2001FUTURE WARFA RE CONCEPT S DAR PA is investing i n a number of diverse t echnologies a nd prototype demonstration s that will en able fu ture op erational con cepts for a wide variety o f critical military missions c ombining manned and unmanned sy stems and i n spac e, in the sea, on land, a nd in the air. The i nvestments for c ombined m anned an d unmanned warfare ar e significan t. The autonomous robotics tech nologies being developed today will allow future warfighters to acco mplish their m issions more effectively with less risk of casualties, th us preserv ing the U.S. m ilitary's m ost important resou rce, its p eople. In space, we a re pursuing re volutiona ry m ethods to extend t he life of spacecraft while they are on-orbit. W e have programs to reduce th e frictional drag on ships , analyze future missions f or attack s ubmarines, an d improve the performance o f towed sonar arrays. For land warfare, we are developing a hybrid-electric d rive reconnaissan ce, su rveillan ce an d targetin g vehicle, cove rt optical tags fo r precisely locating o bjects at ki lometer-ra nges, and altern atives to antipersonnel lan dmines. In the air, we are developing active control of flows using a variety of very small-scale act uators, and, based on our success with the Miniature Ai r Launche d Decoy program , we are fabricatin g a low-co st in tercep tor to enga ge enemy cruise missiles. Combined Manned and Unmanned Operation s Flying m anned aircra ft into hostile terr itory to strike targets or to su ppress enem y air defe nses places the aircrew s at great risk. The DARP A/Air Force Unmanned Com bat Air Vehicle (UCAV) Advanced Technology Dem onstration will prove tha t som e of the most hazardous missions ca n be perform ed effectively by an unmanne d vehicle and made operational by 2010, while, at the sam e time, red ucing costs and risk to human life. DARPA firmly believes that the unit recu rring fly-away co st of th e UCAV weapo n system will be one-third that of th e Joint Strik e Figh ter and that operations and support co sts, co mpared to a curren t manned fighter squ adron, will be redu ced by 75 p ercent. Th e pro gram began its second phase in 1999, selectin g a single con tractor to conduct a comprehensive seri es of si mulations, ground tests, an d flight tests usi ng a su rrogate aircraft , two ful l-scale air vehicle dem onstrators, and a reco nfigurable mission control station. The first UCAV demonstrator air vehi cle was previewe d last year, and t he test flight program started this year. T he X-45A air ve hicle is curren tly co mpleting engine runs and will syste matically move through a series of taxi tests toward a first flight late th is Summer. In 12parallel, a seri es of simulations will d emonstrate th e ability o f an operator to manage a UCAV in a realistic b attle environment. Th e remainder of the curren t phase of the UC AV pro gram, extendin g through FY 2003, will demonstrate: compatibilit y of the unmanned system with the e nvisione d 2010 battlesp ace; robust ness and security of communicatio ns with the air v ehicle; th e feasib ility o f adaptive, au tonomous control of th e air vehicle, with advanced cogn itive decision-aid s for the \"man-in-the-loop\" system o f coordinated, m ulti- vehicle flight; affordability o f operation s and sup port costs; an d deployability o f the system . The pote ntial of the unmanned approa ch to hazardous air missions has also res ulted in a joint DAR PA/Na vy Naval UCA V (UCAV -N) program. The Na vy has a nee d for sea- based, highly survivable, effective and affordable air po wer t o conduct deep strike, sup pressio n of en emy air d efenses, and surveillan ce m issions as part of an integrated air cam paign. A Naval Unm anned Combat Air Vehicle can prosec ute the enem y integrat ed air de fense syste m and high-value targets with relativ e impunity with out placing a pilot in h arm's way. In add ition, a UCAV-N capability th at can maintain continuous vigilance will en able adv anced surv eillan ce, su ppression of enemy air defenses, and i mmediate le thal strike for att acking tim e-critical targets. DAR PA and the De partment of t he Na vy have a greed to a joi nt program to validate the cri tical technol ogies, processes and sy stem techn ical feasib ility o UCAV-N Advanced Techn ology Dem onstration program is structured in two phases: first, analysis and preliminary design, and seco nd, developmen t and demonstration. In July 200 0, DARPA aw arded two Section 84 5 ag reements to Bo eing and Northrop Grumman for analysis an d preliminary desi gn of a UCAV-N air system, and t hose s tudies we re completed in March 2001. In April of 2001, the Phase I contracts were modified to permit more com plete system preliminary desi gn and to begin risk reduction of critical tec hnologies, processes and syste m attributes. A succ essful co nclusion to Phase I would lead t o a seamless transi tion int o Phase II in January 2002. Phase II will continue through December 2004. The jointly fun ded, collabo rative DARPA/ Army Future Combat Systems (FCS) d emonstration program will define the concep t design for a n ew generation of d eployab le, ag ile, versatile, leth al, su rvivable, sustain able and dominant combat syste ms. The program will d evelop innovative tech nologies to g et more firep ower to the battlefield quickly, estab lish dominance on ce th ere, and redu ce th e risks to U.S. so ldiers. A co llaborative syste m of manned a nd unmanned platforms is the key FCS enabl er. DARPA and the Arm y are deve loping the technologies to achieve this new way of fi ghting, m anaging the de velopment risks carefully in orde r to field a highly success ful combat syste m. The pro gram will d evelop a prelimin ary desig n and fabri cate an d test an FCS co ncept demonstrator th at will show how th e collaboration of m anned and unmanned vehicles can establish dominance on the battlefield . At the same time, the program is developing radically innovative enabling techn ologies fo r insertio n in the demonstrator. These jo intly fu nded enabling tech nologies will p rovide mobile, n etworked command, control, FY 2001, the FCS program entered a co mpetitiv e concep t development phase and is co nducting a series of government-run expe riments to eval uate potentially revol utionary impact of vari ous t echnologies on land warfare. In ad dition to this design and dem onstration effort, DAR PA is supporting eight programs to provide supporting technologies: The Unm anned Ground Combat Ve hicle program, to provide increased mobility, ac cess and flex ibilit y for ground com bat units; The Perception for Off-Road Robotics program, which will so lve problems in autonomous ground vehicle m obility; The Organic Air Vehicle program to provide sm all gro und com bat units with their own air vehi cle for surveillan ce and for use as a co mmunicatio ns relay; The JIGSAW program, using laser im aging to facilitate th e identification of targets hidden under foliage; The Comm and and Con trol program , which will develop the necessa ry architecture for a com bat system such as FCS with distribu ted capabilities; 13 The FCS Communications program, for the robust, sec ure links bet ween m utually supporting vehicles needed on the battlefield ; and The NetFires program, a continuation of the Advanc ed Fi re S upport System, to provide precision, vertically lau nched m issiles. The Unm anned Ground Comba t etermining the perfo rmance benefits asso ciated with design of ground combat vehi cles unrestrained by the need to acc ommodate a c rew. The re sulting vehicles are expected to show radical improvements over their crewed counterparts in deployability, en durance, an d obstacle negotiatio n. Th is pro gram began in FY 2001 and will g enerate sev en preliminary un manned vehicle syste m designs for payloads of approximately 330 pou nds and 330 0 pou nds b y year- end. These p ayloads ar e notionally asso ciated with sensor missions and sensor plus weapo ns missio ns. In FY 2002, the program will select at least fo ur designs to conduct critical subsy stem testing (power systems, suspe nsions, structural dynamics, and c ontrols) in conjunction with design refinement in preparation for prototype fabrication, w hich should begin in the Summer of 2002. The Perception for Off-Road Robotics program is determining the extent of autonom ous ground navigation that can be achieved in t he near-term to support tactical as sumptions being made for robo ts in FCS. This p rogram is structured arou nd unscripted fiel d testing perception approaches usin g state-of-t he-art sen sors, algorithms, and processing capability in a wid e variety of env ironmental co nditions. Example multiple perception approaches include dual perspectiv e sen sing with a small unmanned air v ehicle assist ing the ground vehicle, or combined act ive and passi ve sensi ng with radar and infrared sensors. Some appr oach es al so use st rong adaptive learning algori thms to place sens or data in the context of t he local terrain a nd sim plify the identification of hazards. The field tests will in corporate o n-the-fly learn ing by the robo ts an d operation in coordinated team s (in cluding unmanned air vehicles). Th is prog ram began in FY 2001 and will inv olve four co mpeting perception syste m teams, each prepa ring two surrogate vehicles for a utonom ous m obility and perc eption te sting in FY 2002 . In FY 2002, three of these app roaches t o participate in field testing in forest, desert, mountainous, and outdoor urban terrain under both day and night conditions. Th ese tests will b e used to refin e the algo rithms and assess th e performance (and potential perform ance) of each a pproach unde r these widely va rying c onditions. The resul ts will provi de validated d ata for FCS sim ulation models. The purpose of the Organic Air Vehicle (OA V) program is to provide gro und combat units, including Future Combat Syste ms units, with a cap ability to detect adv ersary tro ops concealed in forests or behind buildings or hills - anywhere that U.S. forces d o not have a direct line-of-si ght to the hostile force. Today the military must sen d out human scouts to locate an d identify en emy troops, a slow an d dangerous process. Th e air v ehicle will b e small, lightweight, and inexpensive enough to be carried, launched, and operated by lower-echelon ground units. The goal is that the OAV desig n be less than on e foot in any dimension , weig h less than two kilog rams, and cost approximately $1,000 each in quantities o f 100,000 or mo re (co st for the air v ehicle with out payloads). Th e air vehicle will carry a variety of sen sors, su ch as LIDAR, in frared , or electro-op tic devices to detect v ehicles or individual soldiers. In itial te sting of an OAV cand idate, the Lift Au gmen ted Ducted Fan was co mpleted satisfacto rily last year. In FY 2001, we will co nduct flig ht tests o f promisin g vehicles an d develop flight control software. Th e program will fin alize in tegratio n of co mplete, scalab le vehicles and sensor packages in FY 2003. The Hummingbird A160 program is developing a rev olutionary adv ancemen t in the cap abilities o f helicopters. The p rogram began i n 1998 to satisfy a military need of the Arm y and t he Marine C orps for an a ffordable, vertical take-off and landing unmanned ai r vehicle with a long ferry-range (greater than 2500 nautical miles) an d high- enduran ce (greater th an 24 to 48 hours) cap ability with substantial p ayloads. Th e A16 0 is also being developed as a sensor and communications platform for U.S. Special Operations Command a nd the DAR PA/Army Fut ure Combat Syste ms program. Au tomated fligh t controls an d an au tomated ground statio n will allo w op eration of the aircraft with minimal operator training. The flight control system and gr ound station we re demonstrated successf ully last year wi th a surrogate unmanned helicopter. The rotor system was al so demonstrated on a ground-based rot or test stand i n the past year, and the first A160 air vehicle is expected to begin flig ht-testing th is year . In FY 2002 and 2003, the A160 program will integrate and demonstrate sev eral surv payloads. The JIGSAW program is devel oping LADAR sensors to enable com bat identification by humans. Unlike video data, LADAR sensors will p rovide three-d imensional inform ation that can penetrate ho les in foliage and assem ble in formatio n from multiple viewpoints as t he sen sor moves aroun d the potential targ et. This program, 14which started in FY 2001, is collecting experimental data mimicking FCS environments an d is developing software to perform the assem bly an d visualizatio n of three-d imensional information. In FY 2002, the pro gram will b uild prototype LADAR sensors with integrated software to perform experi ments in realistic scenari os. The objecti ve of the FCS Comm and and Contr ol program is to devel op an integrated com mand and co ntrol syste m for the Future C ombat System Unit Cell th at en ables two to six people to comman d all org anic assets, both manned a nd unm anned, i n combat. Since the proposed a rea of infl uenc e, operational reach, and lethality of the cell's orga nic assets are com parable to that of a curre nt operation al battalio n, this program is atte mpting to redu ce the command and control staff b y a fact or of 10 . Th e current battle co mman d approach is sto vepiped in nature and is not integrated. The operational constructs of FCS dictate the need for a respon sive, integrated command and control system to support th is new app roach to distribu ted networked battle. Th e program began in Octob er 2000, and has m apped i nformation fl ows, tasks, operational constructs and technical build re quirements for the integrated comman d and co ntrol arch itecture. Th is year, th e prog ram co ntinues research in integrated battle co mman d and modeling and conducts an initial p ilot test s imulation of a un it cell in combat. We begin a series o f four ex periments in integrated battle co mman d in Octob er 200 1, with the final ex periment planned for April 20 03. The objective of the FCS Communications program is to create a real -time, mobile, ad hoc network capable of operating with the extrem ely low probab ility of detection and robustne ss to jamming necessary for positive robotic and fire control requirements. In FY 2001, th e program selected c ontractors to devel op critical ena bling techn frequencies; low Radio ) technol ogy for dynam plex ra dio freque ncy environm ents; mobile ad hoc net work technology for smoothly blending the high bandwidth and low bandwidth technologies into an assured sing le netwo rk; and network modeling and simulation. In FY 2002, the program will do wn-select to a single team for system integration and dem onstration. The Future Com bat Syste ms and the U.S. Marine Cor ps' conce pt for Operational Maneuve r from the Sea both envision the use of f orces rapidly depl oyed by air and se a that need t o be abl e to call upon preci sion, responsive firepower guided by beyond-the-horizon targeting . The NetFires program is devel oping a family of sm all, container-launch ed missiles to provide massive, responsive, precision firepower early in a conf lict an d is a k ey element supporting beyond-line-of-sight eng agements for the DARPA/Army Fu ture Combat Syste ms program. NetFires is designed for low lo gistics burden and low life-cycle cost: a single C -130 c ould delive r a shipping container with 150 NetFires missiles capabl e of e ngaging 150 separat e targets up to 200 kilometers away . The syste m is sh ipped in its lau nching container, requires no additional launch support equ ipment, and can be fired remotely from trucks, HMMWVs, or a va riety of ot her platforms. NetFires' rounds are ready to fire immediately, resulting in a much higher po tential rate of fire th an is possib le with cu rrent howitzers or missile lau nchers. Last year, the progra m tested both a variable thrust motor, a key enabl ing technology, and a launche r. This year we are continuing to verify the operation of the variable thrust motor, having successf ully dem onstrated m aximum-flight- duration m otor burn-tim es. Both missile contract ors have success fully conducted their first boos t test vehicle launches, a nd we are conducting see ker ca ptive flight tests and extensive wind tunnel tests; air drop tests of the loitering attack m issile will take place th is summer. Initial ungui ded air vehicl e flight-testing be gins this year, a nd extensive, fully integrated missile flig ht-testing will be cond ucted in FY 20 02 and 2003. One key to developing intelligent, autonomous, unmanne d platforms is adva nced software. The Softwa re fo r otics (SDR ) program is devel oping robot software t echnologies to allow a si ngle soldier to interact naturally with and intuitively con trol a large swarm of very sm all micro-robots performin g a co llectiv e task . In FY 2000, SDR demonstrated statistical ly grounded, prob abilistic co ntrol algorithms suitable for d irectin g the action s of a do zen micro-rob ots. In FY 2001, the program is demonstratin g the ab ility of a sin gle soldier to control the behavior of a swarm of 100 simulated micro-robots. In FY 2002, SDR will demonstrate th ese en semb le behaviors on a swarm of 100 physical micro -robots and will tran sfer the softwa re to ph ysical robo t platfo rms. Space Operations The Orbital E xpress program is designed to create a revo lution in space op eration s. It will d emonstrate th e feasibility of refueling, upgrading, a nd extending the life of on-orbit sp acecraft. Automated spacecraft will perform all o f this space work, lowering the cost of doing business in space an d providing radical n ew cap abilities for military sp acecraft su ch as h igh maneuverab ility, au tonomous orbital o peration s, and satellites th at can be 15recon figured as missions change or as techn ology advances. Giv ing military sate llites th e cap ability to maneuver on-orbit would provi de them with dram atic adva ntage s: they would be a ble to eva de attacking s pacecraft and c ould escap e observation by making their orbits less p redictab le to adversaries. Last year, th e program sele cted multiple contractor tea ms to recommend the op arch itecture for an on-orbit serv icing infrastru cture. Th e tea ms reported to DARPA on the space missions they determined would bene fit the most from being se rviced, e.g., surveillan ce satellites th at co uld be maneuvered to coo rdinate overhead co verage with air strikes to prov ide timely battle dam age assessm ent if they could be refueled, or space base d rada rs that could be upgra ded wit h faster processo rs instead of waitin g for new satellites to be launched. In FY 2001, the team s are d esigning a pair of spacecra ft for an on-orbit de monstration of the ena bling t echnologies needed t o make on-orbit servic ing fea sible - autonomous guidance, n avigatio n, and contro l software to control satellite ren dezvous an d prox imity operation s, sensors to measure and match relativ e satellite motions, wid e capture-rang e grapp le and so ft do cking mech anisms, and open satellite bus arc hitectures th at ca n accept plug-i n upgra de compone nts. The program will select one team to build com pone nts necess ary for th e on-orbit demonstration and continue devel opment of key technol ogies. Fabrication and ground-test of the two space ve hicles wi ll co ntinue through FY 2004, with laun ch of the space experiment anticipated for late 20 04. The Cohere nt Comm unications, Im aging and Tar geting (CCIT) p rogram coul d lead to m ore efficient syste ms for track ing satellites and tran smitting communicatio ns to them from mobile platforms. C urrent system s, whic h use ada ptive optics (fl exible mirro rs whose s urface can be cha nged to co mpensat e for atm ospheric aberrations or distortions), are t oo heavy to use i n mobile platforms. The C CIT program will dem onstrate aber ration-free communications, i maging, and tracking using the coherent properties of laser light and aberration correction devices that employ micro-electro mechanical ( MEMS) tech nology. FY 2001 is th e first year of the program, and we are designing and modeling the CCIT system and developing aberration correctio n. Th e program is developing three device typ es, and we will assem ble th e most pro mising into a labo ratory CCIT system in FY 2002. A ll three Military ices are potential cu stomers as CCIT pro vides cap abilities for secu re co mmu nication s. Maritime O perations The goal of the Robust Passive Son ar (RPS) program is to significan tly in crease the perform ance of tactical towed sonar sy stems by cancel ing out surface shi pping noise, the primary cause of i nterference . The R PS pr ogram accom plishes by innovative ssing te chniques coupled with multi-dim ensiona l receive a rrays and ot her e xternal inform ation. The expect ed net system perfor mance gain is 10 t o 20 decibels , and the system is expecte d to di ctate fu ture ar ray and acoustic sens or field desi gns. Las t year, t he program bega n devel opment of the space -time processi ng algorithms to reject interfere nce. In F Y 2001, the program is begi nning development of a p rocessi ng syste m that wi ll integrate th e various algo rithms and is al so planning an in itial d ata collectio n exercise. In FY 2002, the program will co nduct data co llectio n exercises wit h the Navy and carry ou t a preliminary p erformance assessm ent of the integrated system . The Subm arine Pa yloads and Se nsor s Program was a joint DARPA/ Navy program to investigate missio ns for attack submarines in the future, the payloads an d sen sors neede d to conduct these missions, and the impact of these cha nges on the overall subm arine design. Two consortia, formed in 1 999, provided final reports to DARPA and Navy last year, a nd program managem ent of this effort has transferred to the Na vy this year. Concepts gene rated under the study will enabl e the Navy to investigate new payload and se nsor techn ologies for its Virginia Class subm arines. In F Y 2002, DAR PA is eval uating the res ults of the study in consideration of other DAR PA invest ments in m aritime techn ologies. Seve ral innovative techn in underwater p ropulsion c once pts, underwater litto ral warfare co ncepts and antisub marine research can be co mbined to enable new warfi ghting capabilities. One such id ea is a very fast , highly ag ile underwater fi ghting vehicle employing vo rtex combustor technology for propulsion a nd advance d sensor tec hnologies for targeting surf ace ships and subm arines in the littoral regions. The Buoyant Cable Array Ante nna (BCAA) program is devel oping a submarine phase d array antenna in a towed buoyant cab le form at, which will pro vide high bandwidth, full duplex co mmunicatio n cap abilit ies wh ile a submarine is op erating at sp eed and at depth. Over th e next decade, increased emphasis on joint litto ral operations, network cent ric ope rations, and a dvanced threat sens or systems wi ll over whelm the su bmarine's ope rational connectivity. In F Y 2000, the program devel oped and tested antenna and tran smit a lgorithms in con trolled environments, i.e., labo ratory an d in-water co nditions. In FY 2001, DAR PA is con ducting open-ocean testin g of th e 16antenna system to dem onstrate critical perfo rmance milestones. FY 2002, the integrated sy stem will be fa bricated, deployed from both a su rface ship and a s ubmarine, and t ested at sea t o dem onstrate high bandwidth connectivity from a subm arine. The Friction Dra g Redu ction (FDR) is developing a multi-scale m odeling capab ility fo r turbulent flow to allow sh ip desig ners to decrease friction drag by at least 30 pe rcent with a commensurate increase in endurance and/or payload fraction a nd pos sibly significantly increasing s peed. adva nces i n computational ogy, FDR will exam ine whethe r injecting polym ers and m icrobubbles will achieve these goals. In FY 2001, DARPA i s modeling differen t drag -redu ction mechanisms. In FY 2002, DARPA will co ntinue modeling activities, an d begin syste m optimizatio n and desig n of near fu ll-scale lab ex on long-term altern atives to antiperson nel landmines th at would prev ent adversaries fro m maneuvering at-will. The Self-Healing Min efield is developing an antitank minefield that co mpletely eli minates the need for an tiperson nel landmines. Th e military u ses antiperson nel landmines within an antitank minefield to prev ent dismounted soldiers from fin ding and disabling the antitank mines. In the Self-Healin g Min efield, no antipersonnel lan dmines are u sed. Instead , antitank mines detect a breach attempt via mine-to-mine co mmunication and the minefield responds by self-re positioning a fraction of the mines rem aining i n the m inefield to f ill in the breach. In FY 2000, t he program bega n designing and testing three concepts for the antitank mine mobility syste m and communicatio n syste m, investigated behavioral respon ses to breaching, and completed preliminary fi eld-testin g of a liq uid fuel-based hop ping mobility system. Du ring FY 2001, the program is test ing and refining the three syst em concepts, cu lminating with the construct ion of at least 10 prot otype i nert m ines ng FY 2002, the progra m will complete final testing of the first gene ration prototype mines at Fort Leonard Wood, MO. The Reconn aissance , Sur veillance and T argetin g Vehicle (RST-V) prog ram will d evelop, demonstrate an d transition to the Serv ices four hybrid-electric d rive, lightweigh anced nology demonstrator cles that t ransported inside a V-22. T he RST-V's com pact, V-2 2 airlift-requ irements- driven design also makes it attractiv e for t ransport in a wide variety of aircraft, including the CH-47 and CH-53 helicopters and the C-1 7 and C-1 30 fixed -wing aircraft . Th e vehicle will in corporate ad vanced integrated survivability te chniques and an advanced suspension . It wil l carry tegrated sensor Th e RST-V platform will provide s mall-unit tactical reconnaissance tea ms, fire su pport coordinators, and and insertion of a m ulti-sensor vehicle to provide battlespace a wareness. La st year, the first two vehicles rolle d out and the program demonstrated the ability to tran smit digital v ideo and to operate using battery-o nly mode, diesel-engine-only mode, an d diesel-electri c hybrid mode. In FY 2001, th e program is particip ating in the U.S. Navy Exten ding the Litto Battlesp ace Advanced Con cept Techno logy D emonstration and U.S. Marine Corp s Capable Warrio r Advanced Warfigh ting Ex periment to demonstrate the silen t watch /silen t movement capability o f a hybrid-electric v ehicle. Du ring the exp eriment, Force ce, an d targeting in tegrated command, sensor suite digitally lin ked into the Exten ding the Litto ral Battlesp ace wide-area n etwork arch itectu re. Th e thir d and fourth vehicles will also be rolled out this year. During FY 2002, the vehicles will u ndergo survivability, au tomotive, and active su spension performance t esting. The Opti cal Tags program is estigating op tech and in novative fabricatio n techniq ues for covert, kilom eter-ra nge, optical tags sy stems for downed pilot e xtraction, covert tra cking, and precision targeting. Specific application s will b e select ed based on their operation al significan ce an d user inp ut, and then demonstrated in meaningful warfighter experiments. Du ring FY 2001, appliqu\u00e9-based tags are being fabricated and demonstrated at kilometer ran ges. A l ive techni cal demonstration for earl y-entry and s pecial operation forces i s planned for late-Su mmer 2 001, when we wi ll demonstrate specific v ehicle identificatio n with in a co nvoy, ind ividual soldier id entificatio n and locatio n marking app licatio ns. During FY 2002, tests of mproved tags in m ore st ressing, operationally realistic situ ation. 17The Tactical Sensor s program is developing the architecture, sensors, and other technologies to incorporate unattend ed grou nd sensors in to the suite of tools useful to the warfi ghter for detectin g and classifyin g time critica l targets. Th e system will co nsist of miniature, low-po wer in ternetted unatten ded ground sensors, d eployed in clusters and fuse d wit h longer-ra nge space a nd airborne system s. In FY 2001, th e em phasis is on qua ntifying syste m perform ance, d eveloping targ et classificatio n algorithms, and initiatin g planning tools. In FY 2002, the program will fin alize the syste m design and build a nu mber of system s for demonstratio n and validation in the field. Air Operations The Small Sc ale Propulsion Systems prog ram is d eveloping a new class of propulsion system s that will b e smaller than any existing engines, i.e., less than seve n centimeters di ameter and ge nerating thrusts of l ess than 10 kilogram s. The new eng ines will en able development of very sm all missiles to use against small targets, sm all unmanned vehicles fo r clo se-in surveillan ce, an d new sp ace-laun En gines being developed include a shirt-button-sized turbo-jet engine, a rocket engine only 12 millimeters wi de by five millimeters thick, an efficien t and high-thrust seve n-centimeter di ameter turbo-jet, and pulse program bega n det ailed desi gn of the engines. D uring F Y 2001, the program is completing det ailed desi gns, finishing the fabrication of the button-sized turbo-jet engine, and testing the pulse detonation engine prototype and the turbo- pumps for th e 12-millimeter ro cket. Th e program will fin ish fabricatio n and testin g in FY 2002. The performance of any system th at travels th rough air or water is d ominated by the ability to control the flow over its surfac es. To-date we ha ve bee n limited to pa ssive control m ethods s uch as surface sha ping. Recent adva nces in ve ry small-scale actuators a re being use d in the Micro-Adaptive Flow Control (MAFC) program to enabl e active control of flows using a variety of very small-scale actuators. T he MAFC program com bines adaptive control, distributed sensor arrays, and advanced m iniature actuators to provide a cl osed-loop control system for a particular application. T he program is begi nning to demonstrate rev olutionary performance im provem ents for aeros pace a nd marine applications. Performance im prove ments as large as 30 percent have been ac hieve d, with momentum inputs 10 to 50 times sm aller than t hose use d in conv entional systems. MAFC techn ologies are bei of appl ications, including: ada ptive lift-on-demand f or and uninhabited aircraft ; lightweight gas-turbine engines; control of car go aircraft jet en gine exha ust o n the gr ound for safe loa ding operations; and steering projectiles for ex tended range and precision. In addition, MAF C technol ogies hold prom ise for i mproved payload cap acity fo r rotorcraft, enh anced aircraft m aneuverability, ex tended vehicle ran ge, and decrease d fuel burn at lower total system cost . The applications a re guided by system-level performance bene fits and cost assess ments. In FY 2001, several promising co ntrol devices a re testing protocols and dem onstrating open- loop flow control. We tested a pr ototype full-scale flow cont rol system on a C -17 engine an d est ablished that it would not adversel y affect engi ne performance. An a ctive ho ver download alleviation sy stem for the V-22 perform ed better than e xpect ed at one -tenth scale, w ith a 20 percent increase in overall v ehicle liftin g capacity; testin g will p rogress to one-quarter scale in FY 2002. The program will d emonstrate fu lly in tegrated MAFC subsystem s in FY 2002 and Exploiting High-R Techn ologies con investments info rmation tech nology, micro system s tech nologies, advanced materials, and micro-electromech anical syste ms (MEMS). It is t he resu lts of th ese inv estments that allo w us to build the syste ms and capabilities fo r operatio nal dominance of th e future. In an exciting new initiativ e, Bio Futures, we have begun to in vest in program s that lie at th e intersectio n of biology, information tech nology, and the physical scien ces, having realized that th e biological scien ces, when cou pled with DARP A's trad provi de powerful a pproach es for addressi ng m any of the most difficu lt challen ges facing DoD in the next 15 to 20 year s. And in the Beyo nd Silico n Complementary Metal Ox ide Semicond uctors we are pursuing a radi cally different appr oach to the fabrication of l ogic and memories, en abling enorm ous gains in co mputation al power in rovide informatio ilitary through revo lutionary adv ances in: 18 embedded aut onomous syste ms software; High performance c omputing com pone nts; Networking; Seamless compute r interface s for t he warfighter; Ubiquitous computing an d communication resources; and Agent-base d systems. Information techn ologies such as c omputing and networking have come a long way , but their future remains unlimited. Ne w technologies offer great promise, e.g., wireless an d power- and energy-awa re com puting devices, embedde d computers (that is, com puters interacting in real-time with networks of se nsors and act uators), wideband n etworks, MEM devices, mputational biology Howev er, these n ew techno logies also require ad ditional development if Do D's future co mputing syste ms are to be able to take full advantage of them. Embedded and Autonomous Systems Software As c omputers are increasingly embedde d in the real world with networks of act uators and sensors interacting with physical d evices in real-ti me, it is important to design middleware fo r connecting the computing intellig ence to the physical syste m. Adva nced ms are increasingly bec oming totally depe ndent on the efficacy of their embedded com puting system s. Consequently, as we en deavor to imp rove the functionality o f military syste ms, either for reas ons of great er autonomy or hi gher performance re quirements for the warfighter, we must devel op methodologies, tools, and technologies for embedded software that are: Verified and valid ated by design so as to redu ce th e need for ex tensive testin g; Reasona bly well separat ed from the und erlying com puting pl atform to ena ble their upgrade as new process ors become avai lable; and Composable so as to allo w for the addition of new fun ctionality w ithout ex tensive rewriting of the legacy code . As DoD system s increasin gly tran sition from platform-centric to network-centric weapo ns system s, dev eloping a new generation of tech nologies th at can greatly en hance the adaptivity, assurance, and affo rdability of embedded software is essen tial fo r U.S. n ational secu rity. To address th is need, the Progr am Comp osition for Embedded Systems (PCES) pro gram is creatin g new tech nology for programmin g embedded syst ems that will substan tially reduce developmen t and validatio n effort and improve the flexibility an d confidence of th e resu lting software. Th e technology produced by the PCES program in FY 2000 h as been used to refact or complex monolithic operating systems into modular com pone nts that can be reassem bled rapidly to build cust om embedded c ontrol systems. In FY 2001, the program is developing and applying static anal ysis techniques for real-time em bedd ed sy stems' properties and dem onstrating these t echniques to enhance the performance an d robustness of operational avionics missio n computing system s. In FY 2002, the PCES program will d evelop and apply intermediate rep resentation s and mechanisms for code composition and transfo rmation that will syn thesize ad aptiv e software t o control and enhance the quality o f serv ice prop erties of data-stream ing missio ns perform ed by advanced unmanned air vehicles. The Mobile Code So ftwa re program develops software tech nology to reso lve time-critical co nstraints in logistics and mission-planning, including integrated m aintenance and mission planning to support the operation of Marine Attack Squadrons, real-time mission planning and dynamic rep lanning experiments for unmanne d combat air vehicle operation, and adaptive sca n-scheduling for electronic wa rfare plat forms. Dem onstrations of M obile Code S oftware in real-time, distributed, resource m anagem ent of radar se nsors for tracking m oving objects showed that negotiation -based approach es can meet the time requirements of electronic warfare application s. Th e Mob ile Code Software program solves the resource managem ent problem through the interaction of lightweight, mobile software com pone nts. We use a bot tom-up or ganization approach and neg otiation as t echni ques for res olving ambiguities and conflicts to get log istics an d mission-planning solutions th at are bo th \"go od enough,\" and \"soo n enough.\" In FY Code Software uccess dem ed real-tim e negotia tion t echnology in 19missio n planning with user s at Mar ine Aircraft Group 13, Yuma, AZ. In FY 2001, the pr ogram is scalin g-up the techn ology to demonstrate integrated planning maintenanc e planning using real-time negot iation. In FY 2002, Mobile Co de Software will de monstrate rap id, dynamic, negotiatio n-based re-planning in highly decent ralized e nvironm ents and in electronic wa rfare applications. The Mobile A utonomous Robot Software (MARS) program is devel oping software techn ologies that can enable m rategies to automatical ly generate so phisticated robo t behaviors su ch as au tonomous navigation and real-tim e obstacle av oidance. Th ese se nsor-mediated beh aviors will reduce the requ irement for remote operat or control for as urban com bat battle spaces. In FY 2000, MAR S dem onstrate d a suite of off-line learnin g techn ologies that can ra pidly gene rate desired robot behaviors with minimal hand coding of the control software. In FY 2001, the program is dem onstrating o n-line learning ques that rable, adaptive behaviors witho ut human intervention. The ultimate goal is to allo w the warfigh ter to task a robot in th e same terms as h e or she might task a human. In FY 2002, MARS will d emonstrate a train able, perception-based autonomous indoor navigation capability. The goal of t he Software-Enabled Co ntrol (SEC) program is to leverage increased proces sor a nd m emory capacity to achieve higher perform ance and m ore reliabl e software c ontrol sy stem s for m ission syste m platform s. Military ap plicatio ns include in tegrated avionics design and vehicle co ntrol for high-performance un manned air vehicles (UAVs) and unm anned com bat air vehicles (UCAVs), as well as up grade potential fo r existing airfram es such as th e F-15 E, F-18 , and AV-8 B. This research will yield control tech nology that is rob ust enou gh to with stand extreme envi ronments and to enable highly autonomous, cooperating mission sy stems. In F Y 2000, the SEC program desi gned an open software architecture for hybrid discret e and continuous control that supports better integration of control mode l ogic with continuous control laws, i ncluding synchronized switching and new s oftware scheduling mechani sms. In FY 2001, a p rototype implementation of t he hybrid multi-mode co ntrol soft ware i s being completed f or single-vehicle uses , including predictive m odeling of environmental effect s (e.g., wind gusts, turbulence) and safely con trolling mode tran sitions under such effects. Th is tech nology will pro vide enhanced maneuverability/evasive cap ability f or UAV/U CAV system s and enhanced robustness under extreme conditions for piloted syste ms, in creasing the warfigh rovide better-co ntrolled between complex operatio nal fligh t modes (inh erent in vertical takeoff and landing UAVs and high performance/transonic manned ai rcraft), thereby reducing safety risks to the warfigh ter an d vehicle. In FY 2002, the program will d evelop adaptive hybrid control serv ices to ensure stab le operation an d extend the control software desi gn to support highly coo rdinated control platforms. Coordinated multi-m odal control techn ology w ill si mplify th e task of controlling groups of unmanned vehicles, increasing th e cap acity of a sing le warfigh ter to safely control large numbers of air and ground vehicles. This technology will d irectly su pport management of authority with in group s, sup porting the u ltimate goal of enabling safe c ombined manned and unmanned operations. From avionics sy stems to smart weap ons, em bedded i nformation p rocessi ng is the pri mary source for superiority in weap on systems. The new wave of inexpensive MEMS-based sens ors and act uators and t he continued progress in com puting and c ommunicati on technol ogy will further acc elerate th is trend. W eapon system s will becom e increasingly \"information ri ch,\" where em bedde d monitoring, control and diagnostic functions penetrate deeper and with smaller granularity in physical co mponent stru ctures. V irtually all n ew and planned syste ms illu strate th is tren d: propo sed ture fun ctionally integrated \"open flat av ionics architectures,\" inhe rently distributed architectures for National Missile Defe nse and Future C ombat Systems, mission cont rol soft ware arc hitecture f or UCAV, and many others. T hese sy stems all requi re solutions that the Networked E mbedded and Auton omous Software Technol ogy (NEST) program is ap plicatio n- independent, customizable, and a n\" of physical syste ms. Th targ et is to build MEMS-b ased, dependable, real-ti me, embedded applicatio ns comprising 100 to 100,000 co mputing nodes. In FY 2001, NEST is designing Open Experimental Platf orms (including a \"sm art structure\" an d a distributed vehicle appl and NEST i The sm art structure application p rovides act ive, aco ustical/structural mode dam ping a nd ada ptive dam age identification in payload fairings. The distributed vehicle application implements closed-l oop coordination am ong large number of sensors and micro-v ehicles in pu rsuer-evader sim ulations. In FY 2002, p rogram will emonstrate t he software techn ology applications usi ng lightweight, wireless communication networks. 20 High Perfor mance Computing DAR PA's investments in information technology are also providing technology and tools to design high performance com puting components that are ada ptable (i.e., the computer har dware c an be m odified by its own software ), with process ors em bedde d close t o the m emory to prev ent data starv ation and allo w pow er- and energy- aware com puting. Many defense app licatio ns such as dynamic, sen - that is, th e processo r is so fast th at it has to wait for memory to be accessed from random access me mory betwe en operations, thus slowing down the computation. Prior analysis showed that m emory access was growing at th e rate of se ven pe rcent annually, while Moore's Law predicted the doubling of processo r speed every 18 months. This program is aimed at reducing this imbalance. The Data I ntensive Systems program is d eveloping innovative data access techn iques to solve this prob lem and enable new m ilitary ca pabilities. For ex ample, if th e processi ng portions of th e computer arch itecture are physically clo ser to th e memory locatio n, data can be retrieved more quick ly. In FY 2000, the program designed and simulated intelligent me mory controlle rs, ada ptive caches, a nd memory syste ms. In FY 2001, we are completing the concept development and testing of the early prototypes and dem onstrating a 16-fold improvem ent in the speed at wh ich memory is m ade available to the processor for data intensive app licatio ns. Energy and powe r manage ment has now becom e a critical facto r for future em bedded and larg e scien tific computing a pplications. T he Power Aware Com puting/Communication program is devel oping an integrated software/ hardware power m anagem ent techn ology suite comprised of novel techniques that may be ap plied at all levels of a syste m - from the chip to the full syste m. Th is will en able embedded com puting system s to redu ce energy requ iremen ts by a hundred- to a tho usand-fold in military ap plicatio ns rang ing from hand-held computing devices t o unmanned ai r vehicles. I n FY 2000, we be gan power aware com puting and com munications resea rch, metrics, an d missio n scen arios. FY 2001, th e progr is ev aluating and prioritizin g individual FY 2002, pow er management technologies will b e demonstrated showing a p otential 1 0-fold power/en ergy sav ings for and issions, i ncluding La nd Warrior Dismounted S oldier, distributed sens ors, a nd unmanne d combat air vehicles. Networking DoD applications are highly bandwidth-intensive, and their dem anding requirements cann ot be m et by the commercially devel oped networking technologies that are optimized f or web browsing and low data-rate data streaming. The Next Gener ation Interne t program, endi ng this year, has developed the key techn ologies, both in hardware and soft ware , to enable access to extrem ely high bandwi dth. The program has deploye d a national-scale SuperNet test bed that ties together several doze n sites at multi-gigabit rates. A num ber of hi gh-speed, end-to-end networking records we re es tablished during our experimentation. These earl y experiments also reveal ed the vulnerability o f existing networking protocols to bandwidth-intensive flows, and have stimulated a number of efforts to stream line the networking protocol. This year, t he new protocols that enable high-speed acces s at 40 gigabits pe r second are being integrated into network int erface c ards a nd tested alon g with all-optical burst s . The Gigabyte Applicatio ns program is devel oping technologies for a robust, high-speed networking infrastru cture in a heterog eneous environment. By ex tending high-bandwid th capability to wireless link s, it will b e possible to deploy high-speed networks with many hundreds-of-megabi t- to gigabit-per-sec ond ca pacity in rem ote tactical locatio ns with no pre-existing fiber infrastru cture. Su ch link s will also enable high-speed reach back to a command post or to the U.S. Thi s can be contrasted to approximately 20 m egabits per sec ond connectivity made availab le to a handful of U.S. in stallatio ns during the Bosnia con flict - a speed totally in adequate for d istributing sensor output, maps, high-reso lution imagery an d other intellig ence data in real -time. Th e prog ram is also devel oping key DoD applications t hat take adva ntage of a robust capability to stream gigaby tes to terabytes of real- time data. In FY 2001, the program is test ing multi-an tenna wireless network ing techn ology that has the potential for gigabit end-to-end radio frequency connect ivity. In FY 2002, the program will dem onstrate the sensor stream s from radars operatin g in differen t bands or 21locatio ns are network ed and coherently p rocessed to dramatically en hance the sen sitivity an d be arization (TIDES) is creatin g technology to enable English spea kers to locate and use network-acce ssible ultiple langua knowle of those la nguages. Last yea r TIDES starte d developing key com pone nt technologies and c ooperated with Thi rd Fleet in a field experim ent called Strong An gel that ap plied early v ersion s of th e technologies to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in a mock exe rcise in Ha waii. In FY 2001, TIDES is making the technologies m ore ro bust and using them in a more am bitious expe riment called Int egrated Fleet ed at global infectio us disease mo nitoring , that will b e conducted in Bed ford, MA, and San Diego, CA. In FY 2002, the program will add cross-document, cross -language summarization an d translatio n capab ilities d will co nduct experim ents in additional langu ages of defense interest, i ncluding Chinese and Ara bic. Ubiquitous Computing Miniaturized, l ow cost sensors will b ecome more cap able and pervasive in future m ilitary syste ms to detect ground-moving targets and biological and chemical warfar e agents, and for military operations in urban terrain. To fully u tilize th ese sen sor capab ilities, we m ust develop software th at can create an ad-hoc network of deployed sensor devices, an d process i nformation collected by the sensors for recon naissan ce, surv eillan ce, an d tactical u ses for the warfighter. The Inform ation Technol ogy for S ensor Netw orks (SensIT) pro ducing software that en ables fl exible an d powerfu l sensing cap abilities for ne tworked micro -sensors. Du ring FY 2000, the pro gram devel oped new algorithm s for ad hoc se nsor networks, and methods for c ooperative sensin g. The initial version of the SensIT software with dynamic p rogrammin g ability was demonstrated at the U.S. Marin e Corps base at Twentynine Palms, CA, where e xtensive data from acoust ic, seismic, infrared and other sensors was col lected to devel op m icro-sens or network m ethods f or detecting, classifying, a nd tracking ground moving targets an d comm unicating this data to (and recei ve tasking from ) a re In FY 2001, the program is devel oping an integrated software s uite and conducting field dem onstrations, also at Twentynine Pal ms, CA. Thi s demonstration will in clude inter-networking of groun d sen sors with sen sors on mobile platforms such as un manned air vehi cles, p redicting target movem ents, im aging the targets and relaying the im age data to a co mmand ce nter for confirmation. In FY 2002, the program plans a field demonstration and two joint experiments with the Marine Corps. Th ese d emonstration s will featu re fully in tegrated so ftware th at highlights the new operational cap abilities of low-latency networks of programmable, multi-modal micro-sensors for rapi d tracking of ground m oving targets and for detecting and classifying of threats in urban environments. A grand challenge for information technology is bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Computers sh ould di sappea r into the ba ckground while inform ation becom es ubi quitous. The Ubiquitous Com puting program focuses o n developing the underlying tech nologies to provide accessib le, under standable, relevant information to mobile users, based on an u nderstanding of t he use r's tasks and i nformational needs, to provide the user with greater and more timely situ ational awaren ess - thereb ral including: foot-print operating sy TinyOS, that es self-organization of small com puting de vices, suc h as those i n the SensIT d istributed sensor network vehicle track ing demonstratio n; an initial, co mponent-based architecture to provide seam less com puting suppo rt to m obile ground troops , ena bling th em to have access to digital inform ation neede d for thei r tasks; and an arc hitecture to support sec ure, m obile access to \"p ersistent data ,\" i.e., data that m ust be stored and accessed for some period of time, suc h as logistics and casu alty in formation. In FY 2001, the program is developing s oftware c omponents to support nom adic da ta access and re presentations for task-level com puting. Agent-Based Systems The DARPA Age nt Markup Language (DAML ) progra m is creating technolo gies that enable software a gents to identify, communicate with, and understand other software a gents dynamically in a web-en abled en vironment. Agents, which are s oftware programs that run without direct human control or constant supervision to accomplish goals sp ecified b y the user, can be used to collect, filte r and process info rmation - a crucial n eed of co mmand, eveloping an extended XML m arkup 22language that ties th e information on a page to machine-read able sem antics, th us creatin g an environmen t where software ag ents can function. Th is effort will p rovide new techn ologies for operational users by integrating information across a wi de va riety of het erogeneous military sources a nd systems as t he techn ologies are depl oyed in both command and control and intellig ence app lication s. Last year, in the first year o f the program, DAM L devel oped the first working draft of the soft ware l anguage a nd co ordinated it with the World Wide Web Consortium. In F Y 2001, the program is releasing working versions of Briefing Tools, Searc h Tools, and Ontology Creation T ools, an d is defining and testing a toolset for military appl ications o f DAM L techn ologies. In FY 2002, the prog ram will d eploy the DAML Search to ol on an operatio nal Intelink node and prototype selected DAML t ools to enhance search and retrieval to ols at t he Center for Army Lesso ns Learn ed and other military an d civilian venues. Inform ation superiority in the modern battlefield requires that the military b e able to rapidly assem ble a set o f disparate information sy stems into a coherently interoperating w hole. T his must be do ne wi thout system redesi gn and may include -DoD ernmental syste ms, syste ms sep arately d or com mercial-off-t he-shelf and open-s sys ent standa rd. The Contr Base d Sys tems (CoABS) p rogram is building on the technology of ru n-tim e interop erability o f heterogeneous syste ms to develop new too ls for facilitatin g rapid system integratio n. Last year, CoAB S developed and demonstrated a flexible information infrastru cture and an interop erability to ol called the Ag ent Grid, which supports the dynamic depl oyment of com plex applications for m ilitary com mand an d control. The Agent Grid was demonstrated to the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics C ommand Research , Development and Engineeri ng Center (CECOM), Fort Monmouth, NJ, and to the Air Force Resea rch Laboratory ( AFRL), R ome, NY. CECOM is now investigating the Agent Grid for use in their battlefi eld command and control system s, such as the Man euver Control System , and AFRL is ex perimenting with the Agent Grid to solve interoperab ility issu es for Air Fo rce missions. In FY 2001, CoABS is using agent technologies an d tools in military scenar ios to dem onstrate the run- time integration and ility o f heterog eneous syste ms in applicatio ns that ad dress present an d future comman d and control problems. In FY 2002 , CoABS will tran sition run-time integration capabilities to the Military Services by providing the com mand and c ontrol infrastructure for Joint Forces C ommand's nium Challeng '02 , operating Co mman der Advanced Tech nology Dem onstratio n, and facilitatin g new op eratio nal cap abilities fo r the Air M obilit y Co mman d. At present, com plex military problem-solving tasks are eith er performed totally by human operations officers and intellig ence analysts, o r with minimal assistan ce by small knowledg e bases. C omputer train ed in in telligence techno logy must fo rmulate these knowledg e bases. Th e Rapid Knowledge Formulation (RKF) program is devel oping m ethods t o conduct rapid database sea rches, c onstruct knowledge bases, an d draw inferences for key information. T he RKF program is enabl ing end-users to directly enter knowledge into knowledge bases an d to create massive kno wledge ba ses (106 axioms) in less th an one year. It will allow artificial in tellig ence novices t o directly grasp t he cont ents of a knowledge base and t o compose f ormal theories without formal logic training. As a resu lt, it will enable m ilitary and rtise plex tasks by pidly devel oping, extending, and expa nding sm all knowledge bases by a fac tor of 10. Because these knowle dge bases are re quired for a nalysis of harde ned and deeply buried targets, offen sive and defensiv e information operations, and weap ons of mass d estruction capability assessm ents of terrorist o rganizatio ns, the cap abilities en abled by RKF will b e extremely u seful. Th e RKF program began in FY 2000 and dem onstrated a l anguage and and theory expl anation capabilities; it developed 10 to 20 core th eories. In FY 2001, RKF i s demonstratin g direct kno wledge entry b y a single, novice user at a rate of 2,000 axiom s per month entered into a knowledg e base that addre sses easures. By the of FY 2002, RKF will d emonstrate k nowledg e entry o f a biological warfare ch allen ge problem at a rate o f 50,000 axioms per month from each of 25 subject-m atter experts. MICROSYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES DAR PA's pursuits in microsy stems technol ogies are d riving a ne w chip-scal e rev olution in electronics, photonics, and micro-electro mechanical syste ms (MEMS) dem onstrating re techn ologies and pho tonics for m ilitary in formation system s. 23The objecti ve of the University Opto-Centers program is to estab lish multi-investigator university optoelectronic centers with programs closely cou pled to photonic industry researc hers to devel op and demonstrate chip-scale opt oelectronic int egration technologies. The development of advanced, chip-scale optoelectronic modules is essential for future, high-performance m ilitary sens or and information processing systems. U niversity- based resea rch provides the knowledge base an d the highly cap able exp ertise to both in novate and sup port the development of these cap abilities with in industry. In FY 2000, the Un iversity Op to-Cen ters estab lished new capabilities for the design, fabrication an d demonstration of c hip-scale m odules that integrate phot onic, electronic and m techn ology researc h goals and identified m ethods to fac ilitate industry access to t hese technologies. In FY 2001, the program is evaluating s pecific chip-scale integrat ed m odule designs and success of engaging indust ry com mitment to the program. In FY 2002, the program will fab ricate an d test in dividual ch ip-level su b-assem blies for later u se in prototype development. The Flexible Emissiv e Displa y program was est ablished in FY 1999 and i s developing and dem onstrating large-a rea, high-resolution, flexible, emissive, ru gged displays for DoD applications. T he development of rugged, lightweigh t, inexpensive, flex ible displays will be useful for aircraft, sh ips, land vehicles, and foot soldiers. In FY 2000, the program conducted demonstrations in all thr ee key technology areas: backplanes , emissive m aterials, and substrates. is demonstrating low-cost, high-speed, roll-to-roll assem bly process for plastic-film liq uid crystal d isplays an d is de monstrating a flexible, lig htweigh t, emissi ve, color, electrol uminescent display base d upon plastic material. By the end o f this fiscal year, t he program will have demonstrated em issive color display video ca pable of greater than 80 lines per inch on a flexible substrate. The prim ary hum an-machine in terface rem ains the visual disp lay o f informatio n. The DoD has a d iverse rang e of needs for display technolo gy, and today most of these n eeds (approximately 8 0 percent) can be met by commercial part s, while the rem aining re quire ru ggedized or cu ng this year, bega n 13 years a go a nd invest ed over $650 million in display and related techn ologies. The HDS program has pl ayed a si gnificant role in meeting today 's DoD display needs . At the start of the program, cathode ray tube techn ology dominated most applications. Liquid cry stal displays (LCDs) we re just beginning to emerge as an altern ative, primarily fo r power- efficien t, ligh tweigh t laptop computer applicatio ns. Th e primary su ppliers of these tech nologies were in Japan and were unwillin g to work wit h DoD con tractors. Tod ay, fo r most of t he displays i mportant to the Do D, LC Ds continue to dominate, but new technologies are em erging that include MEMS mirror a rrays, light emitting di odes (LEDs), and thin film electro-luminescen ce displays. These latter types of di splays are a vailable from both domestic and internation al sou rces, bu t the dominant LCD su ppliers are still cen tered in the Far East (Ko rea, Taiwan and Japan). Howe ver, the m arket for LC Ds is highly com petitive, prese nting a robust market place in whic h DoD suppliers have ready acces s to the m ost Device tech nology, which is finding applicatio n in th e Co mmon Large Area Disp lay Set fo r Airborne Warn ing and Control Syste m, Joint Surveillan ce an d Targ et Attack Rad ar Syst em and E-2C airbo rne system s and UYQ-7 0 aboard ship; cho lesteric liquid crystal tech nology that can maintain a static image without consuming po wer a nd is finding appl ication for information management syste ms by the Army Military P olice; s mall (one-inch) activ e matrix LCD fo r use in head- mounted dis plays being tra nsitioned t o the Arm y's new reconnaissa nce/attack helicop ter, the R AH-66 Com anche; and low-vo ltage thin film electro luminescence displays for th e forward look ing infrared d isplays in the Army's Abram s M1A2 System Enhancem ent Program . A m ajor investm ent area for t he HDS program has been i n devel oping flexible emissive di splays, including organic light emitting diodes and flexible substrate techn ologies. These technologies a re bec oming available but face c onsiderable manufacturability and long-te rm reliabili ty challen ges. Ho wever, they offer th e promise of roll-up or \"window-sha de\" displays for com pact, porta ble comm and and con trol app licatio ns. In addition, the HDS program h as supported, on a co st-sh ared b asis, th e U.S. Disp lay Consortium (USDC). Th e USDC is m ade up of U.S. display indu stry co mpanies an d provides su pport for the devel opment of display manufacturing equipment, proc esses an d materials. The Consortium has co mpleted more than 40 projects, including 25 that resu lted in commercia lization o f new tools or aterials for fabricating LC D, electro-l uminescent or orga nic light emitting diodes. Relative to defense nee ds, today 's truly global market for high definition displays and t he far greater commercial ap plicatio ns of these d evices has resu lted in an advantageous position for the Do D. Th e DoD strateg y 24as we go forward is to make use of th e global industrial cap ability wh ere it is av ailab le, using existing acqu isitio n guidelines, with con tractors b uying most display co mponents in a highly co mpetitiv e, rap idly ev olving and increasingly robust m arket place. In the future, DARPA will limit its resear ch and developm ent investm ents to focused specific needs where industry is not yet leading the way and a military advanta ge is foresee n. The Photonic Analog-to-Digital Converter Technol ogy program will ap ply photonic tech nologies to improve analog-to-digital converter performance to achieve 12- to 14-bit reso lution at sam pling rates up to 10 g iga-sam ples per sec ond. Sampling at these very high rates enabl es use of m ore complex radar waveforms and i mproved signal- to-noise performance, p roviding enhanced resolution and improve d target imaging for military radar systems. The ability to directly p erform analo g-to-digital conversion of multi-gigahertz sign als at the sou rce, while preserv ing their en tire spectral co ntent, will h ave sign ifican t impact on the performan ce of a wi de rang e of radar, electron ic warfare and commu nicatio n syste ms and create n ew arch itectural possibilities for these syste ms. In FY 2000, the program eval uated alternative desi gns for the optical clock, optical sam pler, and electronic quantizer modules. In FY 2001, the program initial photonic analog-digital co nverter ev aluation and finalizing the design for the dem onstration m odule. In F Y 2002, the program will integrate the photonic clock and sam pler modules nverters per secon d. Trad itional app roaches to intercon nects based on wire in terconn ectio n lead to information processing syste ms that are bulky, heavy, and pow er-hungry. The communication bandwidth and spee d possible with these electro nic interconn ects is lower th an that of the processo r itself, lead ing to bottlenecks within th e syste m. Th e Very L arge Scale Int egration (VLSI) Photonics program is devel oping photonics techn ology that uses optical links i nstead of electronic wire links for chip-to-chip and board-to-board com munications. This new technology will allo w data tran sfer rates faster th an a terab it per second, wh ich is cru cial fo r high-speed processing app licatio ns such as syn thetic aperture radar and automatic targ et recogn ition. In addition, VLSI Photo nics will en able a 10 0- to 1000-times reduction in power and size for these system s. The m ost im porta nt accom plishm ent in the VLSI Photonics program has been the demonstration of the capability to manufacture vertical-cavity surface-em itting lasers with yields of ove r 99 percent on large-area (t hree- inch) wafers. Tech nology for manufacturing conv entional lasers will n ever ach ieve th is lo w-co st, larg e-area capability. Surface-em lasers rated the l owest threshol d curre nts of a ny lasers eve r manufact ured, with estim ated lifeti mes of well o ver 50 years. In FY 2000, the program used o ptical links to transfer useful data between chi ps to allow benc hmarking performance agai nst traditional electrical approach es. We are planning the two major capstone dem onstrations of the program for the third and fourth quarters of FY 2001, the program's final year. T he first involves data processi ng in synthetic apert ure radar, and the sec ond in hypers pectral imaging. Both of these ap plicatio ns generate larg e quantities o f data that are curren tly difficu lt to process in real-time. Th e reduced size of the optical com pone nts and inc reased data proces sing spee ving more than power-volume product for synthetic aper ture radar two-dimensional fast Four ier trans form computations. T his program has success fully captured t he interest of s ystems designers, incl uding commercial h igh-end work station designers, an d has stim ulated the creatio n of at le ast two start-up activ ities to pursue the continued devel opment of the technology. Thermal imaging rem ains a cornerston e tech nology for many military applicatio ns, including small u nit operations, ground, air and sea target acquisition, missile seekers , and threat warning. Significant strides have been made in converting thermal imaging technology from cryogeni cally cooled detectors to uncooled thermal detectors, which have the potential to improve detector performance by a factor of 10. The Uncooled Infrared In tegrated Sensor s progra m has catalyze d a major shift in focal plane array technology. For many years, t he standard uncooled array was based upon a pixel size of 5 0-by-50 micrometers an d an arra y form at of 3 20-by-240 picture elements. This relativ ely large pixel size li mited both the system resolu tion and target acq uisition range, and most importantly, restricted the options av ailab le to the syste m designer. Last year, th is program demonstrated for the first ti me the ability to fabricate u ncooled infrared sensors with a pixel size o f 25-by-25 micrometers, a 7 5-percen t redu ction in area. Although the rmal sensitivity shoul d be reduce d for sm aller pixe ls, the se nsitivity was m aintained 0.050 degrees Kel vin, ex ceeding curren t uncooled perform ance. Th ese efforts will tru ly rev olutionize th ermal i maging, providing lower cost sensors for current systems and al lowing the integratio n of im aging micro-sensors into nov el platform s such as micro air vehicles a nd robotics. A 320-by-240 array incorporating this str ucture demonstrated two times the target acqui sition range of the typical unco oled infrared sensor. In F Y 2000, the program began t he investigation of n ew con cepts for thermally sensitive microstructures. In FY 2001, the program is demonstrating a 25100-gram imaging se nsor with pe rformance accepta ble icro air es. In FY 2002 , the program will incorpo rate high respon sitivity materials in to the detector structures and integrate m aterials an d microstructures i nto imaging arrays. This will establis h the viability of ance in a packa ge 10 to 100 times s maller and at one-ten th the cost o f current thermal imaging se nsors. The objective of the Photonic Wavelength and Spatial Signal Processing program is to develop integrated electronic and opt oelectronic devi ce a nd module technologies that allow the dynamic and r econ figurable manipulation of bo th the wavelen gth and spatial attrib utes of light for adapting, sensing and image pre -processing. The recon figuratio n and data pre-pro cessing capabilities o f these techn ologies will allo w the design and manufacture of real -time sensi ng and imaging systems. These sy stems coul d be de ployed in a wi de variety of tactical systems, such as n ight vision system s, early warn ing sensors, and autonomous platforms. Th is will b e a sig nifican t improvement over the current generat ion of se nsing and imaging sy stems, most of w hich are not capable of real- time data co llectio n, analysis, and presentation. Th e tech nology will allow hyperspectral imaging in real-ti me in a single, ch ip-scale micro system . Th e data contained in a given scen e will b e processed , in term s of spatial an d spect ral content, on-chip at the sensor/imaging array through the heterogeneous integration of detector ar rays, micro -optics, an d controlling electro nics. Th is app roach will resu lt in greater th an an order of m agnitude reduction in the am ount of data that must be transmitted to a user, thereby reducing demand on constrained bandwidth links. Furthermore, sin ce processing is done at the sen sor, faster and more reliab le decisio n making will b e enabled, e.g ., rapid detectio n, identificatio n, an d classificatio n of ch emical and bi ological agent s. The same suite of technologies can also be used in the detectio n and recog nition of targ ets an d objects that are otherwise obscured from view. During FY 2000, the first year of the program, we developed the basi c source and detector device technologies that cove r spectral bands between 350 nanometers an d 14 microm eters. In F Y 2001, the program is demonstrating emitters and detecto rs in th e spectral band 350 to 500 nanometers. In FY 2002, the program will d evelop micro- machined optical ele ments fo r the spect ral band 300 to 500 nanometers an d three to five m icrons in the infrared band. The Advanced Lit hography program is seek ing solutions to critical technical ba rriers i n emerging m icrocirc uit fabricatio n tech nologies th at are essen tial to improving the computational speed, functio nality, size t, and of microelectron ics. These p erformance will b enefit essen tially all ad vanced military systems, including computation and signal processing for communications, s ensing, and guidance sy stems. In FY 2000, the program develope d key tool com pone nts, materials and proce ssing to accelerate the a vailability of emerging litho graphy tech nologies beyond 193 nanometers. In FY 2001, the program is d emonstrating key compone nts of a m askless wafer writer a nd key c ompone nts fo r lithogra phy of 0.07-m icron features. In FY 2002, the pro gram will d evelop key too l components, m aterials and processin g for bo th maskless an d pro jection approaches for lithogra phy at 0.05 m icrons and will fabricate prototype devi ces for m ilitary applications with featu res of 0.1 micron in size. Th e FY 200 2 budget level for the Adv anced Lithog raphy program will reflect an d support th e semico nductor in dustry's decision regarding next generation d ecided to pursu e extrem e ultraviolet lithogra phy as o ppose d to optical and x-ray lithography technol ogies . DARP A's Advance d Lithography program will t herefore re duce in vestments in those areas wh ile con centrating on lead ing edg e technologies critical to military needs - maskless an d nanolithography. DARPA will co ntinue to push the lead ing edge of lith ography into the sub-35 nanometer range, while industry prov the engineering developmen ts for n ext generation lithographies. In addition, DAR PA in itiated a broad effort to identify and develop the next-generation of microcircuitry compone nts to ove rcome the traditional li mits of curre nt silicon technology. T his effort, Bey ond Silico n Complementary Metal Ox ide Sem iconductors, is d iscussed later. The obje ctive of the Three-Dimensional I maging program is to develop the ability to rapidly cap ture a th ree- dimensional imag e of a target an d determine its d etailed target profile. Th is will sig nifican tly en hance th e ability to identify targ ets in cluttered back grounds and to correctly id entify friendly vers us unfriendly targets. Imaging from fast-m oving pl atform s and the requirem ent to enga ge m ultiple targets necessitates the devel opment of an imaging array, which, using a sin gle flas h of laser illu mination, prov ides bo th intensity an d target depth inform ation. The Th ree-Dimensional Imaging program focuses on the materials, detect or, a nd unique el ectronics techn ology required to obtain, in a single, very short-duration, eye-safe laser pulse, a target depth profile or three-dimensional image of the targ et. Key inn ovations in th e technology are the ability to incorporate gain into the detecto r structure, fabricate fo cal plane arrays of high-gain detecto rs sen sitive at short-wav e infrared wavelengths, and to integrate range-proces sing circ uitry into the unit cells at each detector. In FY 2000, the program evaluated fundam y detection de vices in the short-wave infrared wavelengths, with a foc us on material defect reduction and the uni formity enha ncem ent necessary for array devel opment. Thi s year, the program has demonstrated a fou r-by-fou r detector arra y with a gain of 30 at on e gigahertz and will complete invest igations of novel high-gain det ector conce pts. In FY 2002, the program will dem onstrate a low-power system with a range reso lution of one to six inches at o ne to two kilometers. The Steered Agile Beams (STAB ) program is devel oping small, lightweight laser beam steering technologies for the replac ement of large, mechanically steered mirror system s for free-space optical co mmunications a nd infrared countermeasures sy stems. Ne w solid-state/micro-com pone nt technologies such as optical MEMS, patterned liquid crystals an d micro-optics will p rovide the opp ortun ity to incorporate sm all, ultra-lig ht, rapidly steered laser beam subsy stems into a broader range of military platforms and m an-transportable applications. These a dvance d subsystem s will enable laser desig nators to simultaneously engage multiple targ ets, in crease bo th sm art weapon kill ratio and delivery p latform stand-off distance (and , therefore, laun cher surv w full 360 -degree infrared countermeasures co verage around aircraft an d other high-value military assets, an d provide a secure, covert means of high-bandwid th tran smission programs for special op eratio ns forces and sco ut intellig ence preparatio n of the battlefield . During FY 2000, th e pro gram d etermined the optimum mix of technolo gies to be developed, and established ST AB system architectures and perform ance objectives for s ubsyste m components to fo rm the basis for managing risk and technical progress. In FY 2001, the program is devel oping, fabricating and evaluating the beam steering, emitter, a nd detector compone nts and downselect the most promising app roaches. In FY 2002, the program will develop design goals for assem bled components and fabricate in dividual laser beam steerin g compone nts. High -performance rad io frequ ency system s are critical to a wid e rang e of advanced military rad ar, electron ic warfare a nd se cure c ommunication applications , but they ar e curre ntly restricted to deployment on l arge weap ons platforms due t o the size, we ight and powe r characteristics of electronic s-based radio frequency com ponents. Th e Radio Freq uency L ightwave Inte grated Circuits program will d evelop smaller, lig hter, yet h igher performance photonics-based radio frequency com pone nts capabl e of operating over a much broader range of radio frequencies, while also providing the form fact ors re quired by the small and rapidly mobile weap ons platforms of t he future. This program, which began in FY 2000, is identifying promising ap proaches t o photonic com pone nts or enhanced radio fre quency appl ications. The fi rst year was spe nt developing radio freq uency photonic modules that enabl e links with zero net radio frequency loss from input to output and demonstrating optically integrated modules capable of performing com plex radio frequency functions. In FY 2001, the program is identifying key applications for integrated radio freq uency photonic modules, pro ducing initial p rototypes, to ev aluate their perform ance. In FY 2002, the progra m will integr ate recently develope d emitter s, wave guides, detectors an d integrated circuits to produce radio frequency photonic component prototypes. ADVANC ED MATE RIALS DARP A's Structural Mat erials program is tailo ring the properties an d per formance of structural materials to lowe r the weight and inc rease the perform ance of de fense sy stem s. Technologies are bei ng pursued tha t will lead to ultra-ligh tweight ground vehicles an d spacecraft th rough the use of structural am orphous metals or multifun ctional materials. The program is also devel oping improve d body armor for the individual soldier. The Multi functional Ma terials program explores m aterials that com bine the function of structure with another critical syste m fun ction (power, rep air, ballistic p rotectio n, etc.). Fo r example, in FY 2001 the p rogram is demonstrating the use of fuel cells w hose physical str ucture also serv es as the functional structure for the syste m or platform , significan tly redu cing power generation in weig ht-sensitiv e micro air vehicles. An exam ple is a micro air ve hicle with a wi ng that is the structure , the ante nna, and t he fuel cell wall (hydrogen inside, air ou tside). In FY 200 2, the program will in vestigate st ructu res that co mbine ballistic pro tection with structure. The goal of t he Lightw eight Body Arm or program is to significan tly red uce the wei ght of soldier bod y arm or designed to stop 30 cal iber armor piercing bullets to an aereal densi ty of 3.5 pounds per square f oot. Three ul tra- lightweight body arm or concepts, two of which use act ive arm or techniques, a re supported by the U.S . Army Training and Doct rine C ommand Sy stems Manage r-Soldier. The DARPA program is the first to investigate how active arm or systems could be safely a nd effectively em ployed for personnel protection. Th is year , the program is 27selecting the most viable concept for further devel opment, with subsequent dem onstration of an armor system by the Army planne d for FY 2002. The Structural Am orphous Materials program exploits th e tru ly un ique properties ( toughness, str ength, ballistic p roperties) o f structural a morphous materials fo r critical d efense application s such as b allistica lly resistan t ship structures and as a rep lacement for depleted uran ium in anti-arm or projectiles. In FY 2001, we are d eveloping approaches f or proce ssing these adva nced materials in bulk at reasona ble cost. In FY 2002, we wi ll evaluate the properties of these m aterials in t he context of making si gnificant improve ments for defense a pplications. The objective of the Mesoscopic Integr ated Conform al Electronics (MICE) progra m is to be abl e to create electronic circ uits and m aterials on a ny surface, e.g., t o print electrical circ uits on t he fram es of e yeglasses or interwov en with clothing. The MICE prog ram will p rovide a number of benefits to the DoD. The ability to print ruggedized electron ics an d/or antennas on conformal surfaces su ch as helmets an d other wearab le gear will prov ide new cap abilities and functionalities to the future warfi ghter. MICE tech nologies will eli minate th e need for solder, there by greatly increasi ng the robustness of electro nic circu itry, an d the need for printed wiring bo ards, enabling significa nt wei ght sa vings for a num ber of military electronic plat form s. To accom plish thes e objectives, t he program is devel oping manufacturing tools that directly write or pri nt electronic component s suc h as resi stors, capacitors , antenna s, fuel cells, and batteries on a wide variety of substrat es and with write speeds that approach or exceed c ommercial printing tech nologies - all at s ignifica ntly decrease d processing com plexity and cost. Recent efforts have demonstrated the ability to print metal lines on curv ed surfaces, feature sizes as s mall as five microns, and print speeds cl ose to one meter per sec ond. One of the most exci ting developments has bee n the dem onstration of printed zinc-air batteries that have four times more volumetric p ower density th an commercial b atteries. With these dem onstrations i n hand, industry is moving forward with plans to use M ICE tools for printing bat teries, fuel cells, conf ormal antennas, and circuit interconnects. Pl ans for upcoming years i nclude printing high-gain ant ennas on conform al surfaces, printing s olar cells and fuel cells fo r integrating energy sourc es with the ele ctronics, and making high-qu ality electro nic parts at v ery low tem peratures. The Smart Materi als and Struc tures De mons trations program has applied existing smart materia ls in an appropriate de vice form to re duce noise and vibration and to achi eve aer odynamic and hy drodynamic flow control in various structu res of m ilitary in terest. Th ese devices can facilitate a p aradigm shift for t he design o f undersea vehicles, engine inlets, aircraft wings, and helicopter rotor blades. Demonstrations have included small, high- bandwidth devices fo r aco ustic signature reduct ion of marine turbo-m achinery, shape m emory alloy (SM A) actuators to control the sh ape and attitu de o f fighter inlets to ach ieve higher aero dynamic efficien cies and perform ance, flexible ski ns with em bedde d SM A wire s that perm it continuous c ontrol surface shape changes for improved aerod ynamic performan ce art Wing), and small, p owerfu l actu ators cap able of fitting into the con fined interior space of a rotating helicopter rot or blade for noi se and vi bration reduction (Smart Rotor). We are als o exploring novel way s to make com pact hybrid actuators that will employ smart material driving elements to creat e a new class of efficient, high energy de nsity actuators i n a package that is s maller a nd lighter th an conv entional hydraulic and electromagnetic actuators wi th similar powe r ratings. Thes e new act uators coul d lead t o consi derable weight savi ngs and re duce d complexity and m aintenance i n smaller aircraft an d have application s to the con trol of new typ es of hypersonic missiles. W e concluded the marine and aircraft demonstratio ns earlier th is year, and will conduct the final Sm art W ing wind t unnel te st of a scal e-model unmanned combat air vehicle in the NASA Langley Transon ic Dy namics Tu nnel later th is year. Con struction of full-scale helicopter ro tor b lades in th e Sm art Ro effort is curre ntly unde rway, and wi nd tunnel and whirl stand tests are planne d for late 2001. The overall goal of t he Smart Rotor effort is to successful ly dem onstrate acoust ic noise and vibration re ductions in a flight test aboar d an MD900 Explorer in ear ly 2002 . The Exoskele tons for Hum an Perform ance Augmentation program is devel oping technologies to enhance a soldier's physical p erform ance to enable him, for example, to handle more firepower, wear m ore ballistic p rotection , carry larg er calib er weap ons an d more ammu nition, and carry su pplies greater distances. Th is will p rovide increased leth ality an d survivability o f ground forces in co mbat en vironmen ts, esp ecially fo r soldiers figh ting in urban terrain . Work ing with significan t interest and tech nical in put from the operatio nal military, we are ex ploring systems with vary ing degrees of sophistication and com plexity, ranging from an un powered m echani cal appa ratus to full powered mechani cal suits. The program is addressi ng key technology developments, including energy-efficient actuation sc hemes and power sources with a rel evant operational life, activ e-con trol approaches that sense a nd enha nce an motion, biomechanics and hum an-machine in terfaces , and system design and integration. In 28FY 2000, the program eval uated innovative actuation concepts using chemical energy sources s uch as hydrocarbon fuels t o provide m echanical m otion. In FY 2001, resea rchers are and testin g integrated technologies, activ ities th at will co ntinue in FY 2002. Biomimetic te chnologies loo k for in spiratio ns from biological system s to create hardware wi th superior capabilities. On e focus of the biomimetics e fforts in the Controlled Bio logical and Bi omimetic Sy stems program is to explore the unique mobility o ffered by legged platform s. Th e program d esigned small, leg ged robotic vehicles (the size of a sh oebox) for fau lt-toleran t mobility o ver rough terrai n where wh eeled and track ed vehicles o ften fail. Field -testing with the Marin e Corps has dem onstrated that these platform s have sign ifican t mobility in operatio nal environments such as u rban terrain where larg e ob stacles an d unp lanned rou gh terrain impeded mobility. Preliminary assessm ent of the six-legged platform s called Rhex and Scorpion have shown superior performance i n benc hmarking tests agai nst wheels and tracks and in operational environments of interest. The program now plans to explore developmental prototypes an d define additional military u tility for these leg ged robotic vehicles. We are interested in including additional fundam ental principles of l egged performance, ne w biomimetic struct ural and functional materials an d enhan ced software. Th e program will u ltimately ad d sensor p ayloads for navigation and guidance and to perform specific military appl ications such as reconnaissance, or identification and removal of unexploded ordinance. The Functional Materials program is developing non-structural materials and devices that enable si gnificant advances in commu nicatio ns, sen sing and computation for th e military. Examples in clude: magnetic materials fo r high sensitivity, magnetic field sensors and non-volatile, rad iation-hardened magnetic memories; l ight-emitting polymers for flexible displays; and f requency-agile materials based o n ferrite and fe rroelectric oxides fo r high sensitivity, com pact tu ned filters, o scillato rs, and antennas. In FY 2000, th e program demonstrated light-emitting polymers for flex ible displays with performances alm valent with inorganic atives. Th a frequ ency-ag ile, lig htweigh t patch antenna for UHF satellite co mmunicatio ns that has 20 times less volume than existing antennas an d, thus is su itable for low-p rofile m ounting on the roof of military vehicles. We also developed a v ery low cost, h igh performan ce ferro electric p hase shifter fo r monolithic thin-film electro nically steered antenna ap plicatio ns. In FY 2001, the program is expanding its work in electro activ e polymers to include the development of thin-film spatial filters th at will i mprove by a fact or of 10 the speed and power requirements for sensors for missile d efense. In addition, the program is exploring the development and app licatio n of artificially engineere d nanocomposites or \"meta-materials\" for eving el ectromagnetic properties unobtainable in nature. In FY 2002, the program will d emonstrate act uators th at mimic b iological muscles for ro botic app licatio ns and meta- materials co ncepts a number of im portant DoD elect romag netic app licatio ns. Th e program will d emonstrate a one-megabit, fu lly rad iation-hard memory by the end of FY 2002. This m emory will b e com petitive with conve ntional memories and will defin itely replace some, if not all, of the e xisting random access semiconducto r memories like Flash, Dynamic Random Access Mem ory (DRAM) a nd Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). This memory technology is tran sitioning to the Defen se Threat Reduction Age ncy and the Nav y Triden t Prog ram, and it is beginning to gene rate a significant amount of commercial invest ment. The Tota lly Agile Senso r Systems (TASS) program is devel oping ultra-sensitive ra dio fre quency receivers using high-temperature sup erconductivity (HTS) filters and low-no ise am plifiers. This techn ology will p rovide sen co ence an d signals intellig ence m issions pursued by the U.S. military an d intellig ence co mmunities. Th e goal is to enable superconducting filters and amplifiers th at can achieve up to 10 times the ran ge com pared to conv entional means for detection of low-lev el signals. In FY 2000, the program invest igated seve ral methods t o \"tune\" the frequency of HTS fi lters. In F Y 2001, the program is worki ng toward s tun ability o f 30 to 50 percent of b ase freq uency demonstrating a syste m to detect an d geolocate so urces of unintended radiatio n for th e Riv et Joint aircraft. In FY 2002 , the program will push tunability to 100 percent of b ase frequency, with automatic electro nic selectio n with in one milliseco nd. Th e pro gram will co nsider u sing the technology for non-im aging iden tificatio n and location of battlefield targets. Current sens or syste m architectures se nse signals from a phy sical stimulus, transduce the m to elec trical signals, convert th e electrical sig nals to digital fo rm for pro cessi ng by computers, and finally ex tract critical in formation from the processed si gnals for exploitation. Integrated Sensing and Pr ocessi ng (ISP) a ims to replace this chai n of processes , each optimized separat ely, with new methods f or designing sensor systems that treat the entire system as a single e nd-to-e nd process that ca n be optimized gl obally. The ISP approach is expect ed to enable order-of- magnitude perform ance improvement in detectio n sensitivity and targ et classificatio n accu racy, with no change in 29computational cost, acro ss a wid e variety o f DoD sen sor sy stems and network s, from surveillan ce to rad ar, son ar, optical, and other wea pon guidance sy stems. FY 2001 was the first year of fu nding for this program. In FY 2001, the program is devel oping new mathematical fram eworks for global optimization of se nsor system perf ormance. I n FY 2002, the prog ram will implement physical an d software p rototypes of th e new methodology in test b ed systems such as m issile guida nce and automatic ground target re cognitio n for valida tion a nd to support con tinuing iterativ e development of new design methods for sen sor system s. The Virtual Electrom agnetic Test Range (VET) progra m will develop and de monstrate fast, accurate three- dimensional com putational electromagnetic prediction codes e nabling practical rada r cross -section design of full- size air v ehicles with realistic material tre atments an d details an d components su ch as cav ities, th in edges, an d embedded antennas. Su ccess will p rovide th e predictive modeling phase of aircraft d esign with an order of magnitude savings i n man-hours; two orders of magnitude reduction in com putation expe nses m ay be o btainable. An order of magnitude reduction in range and model cost s is also predicted. The biggest impact of these new capabilities is l ikely to come in the form of cost redu ction s for modificatio ns and upgrades to existing air v ehicles. In FY 2001, the p rogram is developing the capability to predict scatterin g from deep cavities, g aps, crack s, and thin edges with high fidelity. In FY 2002, it will d emonstrate th e cap ability for h igh fidelity p rediction from multi- sensor apertures and arrays. It has been reco gnized that cu rrent and future b attery technology will n ot provide sufficien t energy to meet the requ irements of military missions unless multiple batteries are carried through out a mission, an incredible expe nse i n logistics and m ission effectiveness. T his limitation could also significantly degrade the usefulness of emerging systems such as robots and other sm all unm anned vehicles. To a ddress t his issue, DAR PA began the Palm P ower program in FY 2001 with the goal of developing and demonstrating techn ologies to reduce t he logistics burden for the dismounted soldier by devel oping novel energy conve rsion devices ope rating at 20 watts average power with 10 to 20 times the energy density of batteries. The prog ram is exa mining several ap proaches that can conve rt high-e nergy -content fu els to electricity, with an em phasis on approa ches that can use available military fuel s. Am ong t he techn ologies being considered are: direct oxidation sol id oxide fuel cells; extremely compact fuel process ors for integration with proton exchange m embrane f uel cells; novel small engines; new approaches to solid state thermionic em ission a nd thermoelectrics coupl ed to advanced miniature com bustion syste ms; an d advanced materials an d materials p rocessing . In FY 2002, the prog ram will ev aluate new materials and conce pts compone nts and their integrat ion with microelectronics whi le improving perf ormance and ena bling new capabilities. The MEMS program has bee n focusing on devel oping integrate d, micro-assem bled, m ulti-com pone nt for applications as to be used for biological detection, oxin identification, D NA anal ysis, cellular anal ysis, drug preparation and drug delivery. Over th e last sev eral years, m any significan t programs were estab lished with in DARPA that leverage MEMS tech nology. One such new activ ity is th e Micro Power Gener ation program. The developmen t of micro power so urces will en able ultra-m iniaturizatio n and functionality of new stand alone systems. The use of MEMS techn ology has already dem onstrated si ze power re duction, perf ormance enha ncem ents, new sensing concepts and new fun ctionality in weapon systems and platforms. Micro power sou rces will b e the key compone nts in ultimate miniaturization and integration of standal one, se lf-contained, wireless m icro- sens ors a nd micro- act uators that can be deployed rem otely in clusters to drast ically enha nce s uperiority of weap on systems and field awaren ess. An other new activ ity is th of NM ASP will enable ultra-m iniaturized (the size o f a wristwatch or hearing aid ) and ultra low-po wer UHF co mmunicators/GPS receiv ers, greatly improving the mobility and location iden tificatio n of in dividual warfighters. NMASP technologies will the se new compone nt level technol ogies , as well as ne w methods for production of mass spect rometers, cal orimeters, bolometers, and high-resolution infrared imaging devices. The objective of the BioFluidic Chips (BioFlips) program is to demonstrate tech nologies fo r self-calib rating, recon figurable, to tally in tegrated bio-fluidic chips emical param eters and on-chip, direct interfac e to sam ple collection. In FY 2000, its first year, Bi oFlips identified promising microfabrication platform s to integrat e fluidic chip c ompone nts and develo ped seve ral subsy stem approaches t o achieve syste m specifications. T he program used advan ced m odeling of m icroscale fluidics to evaluate these 30subsystem In FY 2001, BioFlips is developing closed-loop bio-fluidic chips plex cel lular and m olecular proce ssing through the integration of individual biomolecul ar transport com pone nts and in situ sensors for local feedba ck control of the fluid param eters. In F Y 2002, the program will dem onstrate optimization of subsystems and c ompone nts for integration into prototype systems. Exam ples of prototype systems include m icro flow cytom eters that a re the size of a wristwatch , a sam ple prep aration microsystem that ex tracts purified DNA fro m whole blood samples, and a wristwatch-sized physiological monitor that can acquire body fluids through the skin for measuri ng blood gas partial pressures, pH, BIOFUTUR ES (BIO:INFO:MICRO) DARPA's investig ations at the intersection of biology, in formation technology and th e physical scien ces (Bio:Info:Micro ) began in FY 2001 with the realizati on that th e biological scien ces, wh en coup led with the traditional stren gths of DAR PA in material s, information and m icroel ectronics, co uld provide pow erful approach es for addressing many of the most difficult challenges facing DoD in the next 15 to 20 years. Chief among these challen ges is prev enting human perform ance fro m becoming the weak est link on the future battlefield . For example, DoD m ust be able to m aintain the d ecision-making a nd fi ghting ca pability of th e soldi er in the f ace of asymmetric attack (e.g., biological warfare defense), st ress and increasin gly complex military o perations. We will explore and devel op new capabilities and methods for perform ing com plex m ilitary operations by applying what we learn from the models provided by living sy stems, whi ch function and s urvive in a com plex environment and adapt , out of necessity, to ch anges in that environment. In shor t, the combination of biological scien ce an d technolo gy offers an aven ue into the understanding - and development for defense a pplications - of systems that are ca pable of com plex, robust, and adaptive operations using fundam entally unreliable com ponents. As we pro ceed with th e Bio:Info:Micro initiativ e, tw o development themes emerge that have become our organizing principles: critical h uman facto rs for future warfigh ting, an d complexity in military o perations. Th e proliferation of tech nology on the battlefield and the open-market availab ility o f extremely capable weapon ry are dram atical ly shorte ning the timelines for critical decision-m aking while increas ing the c omplexity of the battlespace. The too ls we d evelop at th e intersection of biology, informatio n tech nology, and the physical scien ces will en able radically n ew co mman d cap abilities to deal with this in creased complexity in warfare, while add ressing the increasing dem ands being pl aced on our warfighters. Critica l Human Factors fo r Fu ture Wa rfigh ting: Hu man physical an d cognitive limitatio ns often constrain technological supe riority and superior wa rfighting, especia lly in a future battlespace tha t will con tinue to increase i n complexity an d tempo. A major thru st for DARPA's Biologic al Sci ence and Tec hnol ogy program is to explore solutions to exten ding human perform ance. Solutions include extending physical an d cognitive performan ce during the stress of military operat ion, and interacting with complex, teleoperated, semi-autonomous, a nd autonomous syste ms. Th e program is explo ring biological p rinciples and practices t o enable new capab ilities to sustain or extend human performance fo r future warfi ghting. Th e program will investigate therapeutics, sensors, materials, n eural and mechanical int erfaces , biological or biom imetic controllers , and le memory and training. Complexity in Milita ry Op erations: Military op eration s and system s are increasi ng in complexity. Do D must explore new solutions able to maintain superi or performance in spite o f increased complexity. Li ving system s demonstrate robust solutions as t hey oper ate in a co mplex wo rld by optimizing per formance t hrough ada ptive evolution. A major thrust at DARPA will b e to explore and develop new cap abilities to perform complex military operation s based on the principles an d pract ices o f biology. Of p articular interest to DoD are b iological cap abilities for: regenerat ive, c ooperative, or a processing; gnition isition; maneuverability d navigation; stab ility in wid e environmental extremes; and communication of singular or networked systems. Three pro grams illu strate DARPA's em phasis on human facto rs and complexity in military op eration s: The Metaboli c Engineering for Cellul ar Stasis program is invest igating biological pract ices t hat allow organisms to adapt to environmental extremes (water, te mperature, salt ) and using these practices to e ngineer new cellular systems such as pl atelets and re d blood cel ls. In FY 2000, this revolutionary effort demonstrated the functional reco very of dry platelets and ot her cells that coul d be u sed in therape utic or diagnostic applications f or 31DoD. Fu ture effo rts will fo cus o n new en gineering methods and practices th at resu lt in the enh anced stabilizatio n of cells an d tissu es. The Bio-Computation Pr ogram is expl oring and devel oping com putational methods and m odels at the bio- molecular an d cellu lar lev els for a variety of DoD an d national security applications. The program is de veloping powerful, synthetic com putations t hat can be implemented in bio-substrates, an d computer-aided analytical and modeling tools that predi ct and control cellular processes a nd sy stems of living cel ls. The D oD ap plications o f the program include the ability to pred ict cellu lar-lev el effects of chemical and biological ag ents an d the underlyin g pathogenic processes; the effect of st ress on cell functions (such a s circadi an rhythms) that affe ct warfi ghter perform ance; a nd mechanisms fo r controlling these effects. We are selectin g performers in FY 2001. In FY 2002, the program will b egin to develop scalable, DNA-b ased computing and storage and computational models that capture the behavior of mechani sms in living cells underlying pathogenesis and rhythms that are co mmon to many molecular-scale processes i n chemistry, biology and en gineering (el ectronics, opt ics, M EMS) through expe rimental and t heoretical anal yses. T he program is begi nning this year by developing experiments, models, phenomenological relationshi ps an d scal ing laws fo r a ra nge of bio-molecular rec ognition processe s (i.e., a ntigen- antibody, DNA hy bridization, enzyme-substrate interactions) and bio-fluidic transport processes i n microsy stems. In FY 2002, SIMBIOSYS will d evelop transdu ce th ese m olecular reco gnition sign als to measurable electrical/optical/m echanical signals through i ntegrated on-chip ele ments that interface with t he biological recognition process. We wi ll charact erize and quantify innovative transduction (and signal amplification) m through experiments and models. BEYOND SILIC ON COMPLEME NTARY METAL OXIDE SEMIC OND UCT ORS We are a pproaching the end of a remarkabl y successf ul era in computing - t he era i n whi ch Moore's Law reigned a nd where processi ng power per dollar doubled every year. In large pa rt, this succe ss was a res ult of adva nces i n complementary metal oxide se micond uctor (CMOS)-base d integrated circuits. Although we ha ve come to expect, a nd plan for, the e xpone ntial incre ase in processi ng power i n our everyday live s, today Moore 's Law faces imminent chal lenges both from the phy sics of deep -submicron CMOS devices an d from the eno rmous cost s of next- gene ration fabrication plants. Thi s situation requires DoD to consider a ra dically different approach t o the fabricatio n of l ogic and memories - a pro gram we call Beyo nd Silicon CMOS. The Bey ond Silico n CMOS thrust is starting in FY 2001. Th e initiativ e is aimed at m aintaining the phenomenal progress in microelectron ics in novation that has serv ed military syste ms designers so well o ver the last 3 0 years. Taking advantage of advanced m aterials depo sition and processi ng techni ques that enable increasing control over material an d device structu res down to nanoscale d imensions, the Beyond Silico n MOS initiativ e will en able low - cost-to-m anufacture, reliable, fast, a nd secure inform ation syste ms critic al to m eet future m ilitary needs. Because the tra nsistors can be m ade so small, we ca n make chi ps with a very large number of tran sistors p er chip, which allows greater fault toleran ce and high speed (fu ture m icroprocessors based on these techn ologies will ru n at sp eeds 10 to 100 times fast er than today's best gigahertz-level clock rates). And, with the resulting great er computational power, we will b e able to run more co mplex algorithms to improve security. In the case o f the ultimate computers that ex ploit quantum mechanical effects, w e will be able to mak e use of physical p henomena not available in today's electro nic devices to achieve computational capabilities unav ailable by traditional tech niques. With a goal to develop new device capab ilities, DAR PA is exp loring n-based an C ompone nts an d sy stems leveragi ng quantum effect s, an d innovative approaches to com puting designs incorporating these c ompone nts, will allow low- cost, seam less, \"pe rvasive computing\" (making generally avai lable the kind of com puting power normally associated with larg e computing fac ilities); u ltra-fast com puting; and sensing and actu ation devices. Mu ch as today's desktop com puters have the power of the super-c omputers of a decade or so ago, these c hip-scale com puters will en able sup er-computer-like cap abilities in portable mach ines. The military i mpact co uld be, for example, to enable a co mputationally in tense synthetic ap erture radar capability on a small u nmanned air v ehicle. 32The Beyon d Silico n CMOS th rust is com posed of five p rograms that will d evelop new cap abilities fro m promising information processing com ponents using both inorganic and organic substrates an d component s and systems leveragi ng quantum effect s and chaos. The first of the Beyo nd Silicon CMOS pro grams is Comp ound Semicond uctors (ABCS ). goal is to develop low-power, high-frequency electronics ci rcuits and i nfrared sources based on the ant imonide family of compound sem iconductors. Specific g oals inclu de circuits wi th over 104 devices pe r circuit operat ing at frequencies above 100 gigahertz and c onsum ing less than one fem towat t (10-12 Joules per second ) - a tw o-order-of- magnitude improvement over today's cap abilities (i.e., 10 times faster, co nsuming one-ten th the power). Specific infrared source goals include operating above th ermoelectr ic-cooled temperatures, w ith much greater efficiency fo r continuous wave, m id-wave i nfrared and single-mode op eration in the long-wave i nfrared ran ge. In FY 2001, this program demonstratin non-silicon -based t device applica tions. In FY 2002, ABCS subst rate technology will acc elerate recent breakthroughs in later al epitaxial ov ergrowth and thin-film d elaminating and rebond ing to develop a sou rce for ABCS su bstrat es with essen tially an y desired the rmal or el ectronic prope rty. Another program is Integra ted Mi xed Signal Analog/Digital and E lectronic/Photonic Systems (NeoCA D) with a goal of devel oping a nd demonstrating innovative approaches to com puter-aided design of mixed si gnal (anal og/digital) and m ixed el ectronic/photonic systems. The objective is to design and prototype the ultra-complex micro systems having the high degree o f integratio n and complexity n eeded for military a nd co mmercia l applications. In FY 2001, NeoCAD is devel oping fast algorithms for non-linear a nalysis mixed si gnal systems (anal og a nd photonic devices), a nd the program is extending al gorithm methods t o non-linear problems. In FY 2002, NeoCAD will de velop m odel order re duction methods (for a nalog and photonic de vices) to enable the creatio n of device behavioral models, and will d evelop and demonstrate top-down design capabilities for an alog, mixed si gnal and m ixed el ectronic/photonic systems match the effi ciency currently achi eved with digital-only designs. The goal of the Spins In Semicond uctors program is to change the paradi gm of ele ctronics from electron charge to electron spin. This can ha ve p rofound impact on t he performance (spee d and power dissipation) of memory and logic for computation and for optoelectronics for communications. We ca n ultim ately expect increases in bot h stora ge densities and processi ng speeds of at least 100 to 1000 tim es. This will give the warfighter the ability to process and assi milate much more data th an possible by other m eans and make him much more situationally aware . Many DoD sy stems wil l also benefi t from this significantly enhanc ed pe rformance by enabl ing much more sophisticated si gnal processi ng by allowing our systems to handle significantly more data. For exam ple, if we are su ccessfu l, we will p rovide orders of m agnitude more flex ibility to our remote sen sing assets. Th e program has al ready dem onstrated long-lived electron spi n cohere nce in se miconductors, w hich translates to very long spin-propag ation distances. In FY 2001, we will demonstrate that sp in informatio n can propag ate acro ss boundaries bet ween different semicond uctors in a het erostructure without any loss of s pin information. In FY 2002, we intend to demonstrate a ve ry high-speed optical switch using spin precession to control optical polarization. The Polymor phous Com puting Architectures program is devel oping a revolutionary approach to implementing embedded computing syst ems that su pport reactiv e, multi-mission, multi-sen sor, an d in-fligh t retargetable missions a nd reduce the time needed for pay load a daptation, optimization, and ve rification from years to days to minutes. Thi s program breaks t he curre nt development approach of \" hardware first and s oftware l ast\" by moving bey ond conventional com puter har dware an d software t o flexible, polymorphous com puting systems. Thi s program is just beginning and i s identifying react ive, in-mission com puting r equirements and potential polymorphous com puting concept s in FY 2001. In FY 2002, the program plans t o model and eval uate candi date polymorphous com puting arc hitectures. The Quantum Inform ation Science and Technol ogy (QuIST) program is de veloping information technology devices and s ystems that levera ge quant um effects and technol ogies for scala ble, re liable, and secure qua ntum computing a nd com munication. Quantum computers and c ommunication sy stems are p otentially much m ore capable a nd secure t han today's syste ms and ca n serve DoD's increasing need for secure c ommunication a nd computational power to meet the stringent requirements of military data and si gnal processing. The QuIST program begins this year with investigations of component s and archi tectures of quantum information processing systems, 33along with algorithms and protocols to be implemented on those syste ms. In FY 2002, the prog ram will demonstrate techni ques for fa ult-tolera nt com putation and secure c ommunication, a nd will dem onstra te compone nts of quantum photonic com munication systems. In a re volutionary departure from today 's pai nstaking circuit fabrication m ethods , the Molecul ar-scale Electronics (Moletronics) program is pursuing the construction of circuits using nan oscale com ponents such as molecules an d inexpensive che mical self-asse mbly processes. Th ese ch emicall y asse mbled system s will h ave high device density (scal eable to 1011 devices per squ are cen timeter, ab out 100 times th at of curren t silico n integrated circu its) an d low power. It is now realized t hat requirements fo r electrical powe r drive m uch of the i nform ation-a ge infrastructure, placing e ver great er need to obtain low-powe r electronic sy stems. In FY 2001, th e program demonstrated both the ab ility to reversibly switch memory molecules at ro ols\" of computation an d \"NOT\" gates), and a working 16-bit memory at 1 0 times the density o f silico n Dynam ic Random Access Mem ory (DRAM). In FY 2002 and 2003, we will optimize the perform ance of t he molecular devices, dem onstrate a molecular gai n device, increase devi ce densi ty, and devel op innovative archi tectures that exploit the unique properties of switching on the molecular scale to demonstrate the adva ntages of electronics on this scale. Conclusi on Both Presi dent Bush and S ecret ary Rumsfeld continue to highlight the nee d to take ad vantage of ne w possibilities o ffered by the ongoing techno logical revo lution, as well as to develop defenses again st modern technological th reats. I hope that this short su mmary of DARPA's i nvestment strategy h as outlined how DARPA stands read y to do both - provide techn ological o pportunities for our warfigh ters, and harness techno logy to provide advanced defenses. Ou r pro posed program, of course, will h ave to change as th e nature of th e threat ch anges, and as the strategy for coping with those t hreats evolves. I thank you for the opportunity to spea k with you today , and welcome your questions. 34 Appendix - Examples of DARPA' s Scien ce and Technology Investments in Support was structure d to attack risi ng m issile cost s with a combination of process an d product chan ges t o reduce the cost and cycle tim es for tactical missile manufacturing. The results are bei ng felt in over 13 military systems, including: a common inertial measuremen t unit for the Wind Correcte d Mun itions Disp enser; commercial p arts activ ities for the Low Cost Autonomous Attack Syste m and Arm y Tactical Missile Syste m; flex ible m anufacturing system s for Patrio t Ad vanced Cap ability-3 ; electron Anti-Tan k weap ons; co mmon test approaches for the Evo lved Sea Sp arrow Missile (ESSM) and Sting er; multi-missil e facto ry approaches for th e AIM-9 M Sidewind er, th e Rollin g Airfram e Missile, ESSM , Javelin, and BAT brillian t anti-arm or subm unition; and improved soft ware too l approaches for BAT an d the Advan ced Precision Kill W eapon Syste m. The DARP A Com pact Las ers program was devel oped to defend aircraft agai nst heat-seeki ng missiles. The diode-pumped, mid-infrared, solid-state laser technology developed i n the program has been s elected to provide the multi-ban d laser fo r the Air Force 's Phas e I Large Air craft In frared Cou ntermeasur e pro gram. This pr ogram's purpose is t o protect large a ircraft from all curr ently fielded m an-portable heat -seeking m issiles. Phase I of the program will outfit larg e tran sport aircraft such as th e C-17 and the C-13 0 with defensive systems th at use the DARP A-sponsored lase rs. For m any airborne sy stems involving video or infrared sens ors, a wi ndow protects the senso r from the environment. Flat or gently curved windows can cause drag and other degradations to platform performance. In the Precision Optics program, the wi ndow is shaped to meet the nee ds of the aer odynamic envi ronment, rat her than forced to fit commo nly used optical sh apes for aircraft a nd missiles. Th is redu ces th e aerod ynamic drag, which will increase t he range or velocity of the missile, and maintains low observab ility. Precisio n Optics tech nologies were demonstrated in an advanced variant of the Sting er missile. Th is varian t of Sting er, lik e all oth er electro - optic/in frared guided missiles, had an aerodyn amically blunt, hemispherically sh aped dome. Using Precisio n Optics technology, the n ew seek er head incorpo rated an ellip soidal-sh aped dome fo r red uced aero dynamic drag and used correctors to c ompensate fo r the look-angle-dependent aberrations. The seeker succe ssfully acquire d and trac ked targets at Redstone Arsenal, AL. The Army and Navy are c onducting development efforts to use the DAR PA techn ology in adva nced missiles. The recog nition cap abilities on e-foot resolution syn thetic ap erture imag ery th at is increasi ngly avai lable from operational platform s. The MSTAR algorithms were eva luated as a c omponent targ et recognition al gorithms with the model-based M STAR algorithms. The M STAR algorithms have demonstrated correct detection rates of 90 perce nt or better, and identification rat es of detected targets of 80 percent or better. The MSTAR -enhanced SAIP sy stem assists an anal yst in forming re ports and i dentifying target types a mong a set of more than 30 modeled target types. SAIP has tra nsitione d to a J oint Program Offi ce in the Army Space Program Office, which is integrating SAIP cap abilities in to the operatio nal Tactical Exp loitatio n Syste m. The GPS Gui dance Package (GGP) program has developed a sm aller, lower-cost, long-life navigation system based on highl fi ber optic gyros, silicon accel erom eters, and miniature GPS receivers. The Arm y is testin g the GGP th is Sp ring as an improvemen t for th e Mu ltiple Lau nch Rocket System firing unit. Th e adoption of GGP will give the Army the poi nting accur acy it needs for its fire support at a fraction of the lifecycl e cost of the current Arm y system. As U.S. tactical aircraft e ngage a ta rget, the radars of an adversary's integrated ai r defense system may track them. DAR PA has devel oped the low-cost Miniature Air-Launc hed Decoy (MALD) to c onfuse these de fense s. This program achieved its afford ability o bjectiv e, an average unit flyaway p rice of $30,000 (FY 1995 dollars) if 3000 units are produce d. This price is many times lower t han cu rrently available air-launched decoys, and de program managem ent has 35been s uccess fully transferre d to the Air Force, with flight-t esting continuing th is year. The Ai r Force is planni ng a \"Silver Bullet\" procurem ent of 100 to 150 MALD units beginning in FY 2002. In the detection and identificatio n of b iological warfare agen ts, an tibod y-based sensors have trad itionally h ad difficulty distinguishing between t he organism that causes ant hrax and other nat urally occu rring, non-pathogenic relatives wi thin the same genus. Under DARPA sponsorship, resea rchers have devel oped a set of antibodies that are highly sp ecific to anthrax, but not to its non- pathogenic relatives. Cur rently, f our of these Anthrax A ntibodies are being evaluated by the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defe nse C ommand (E dgewood Area, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD) as a possi ble replacem ent for the ant hrax an tibodies in DoD an tibody-based sensor s. This will decrease th e possibility o f false alarm s caused by cross-reactiv ity of the antibodies that identify t he bioagent. Another DARPA de velopment is of ne w antibody-binding reporting m aterial called Upconver ting P hosphor s (UPT) for use in sens ors for biological warfare a gents. Many conventional sensors use fl uorescent tags to report the presence of a bi ological warfare a gent as m anifested by a binding event taking place (e. g., antibody-to-antigen binding), but the tags have several shortcomings. Fl uorescent tags absorb and emit lig ht in so limit sensor sensi tivity. ad dition, a ( different fluo resce nt wavel engths) exist. On the other hand, the UP T materials are engineered with a novel arrangement of e nergy states to allow ab sorption and emission in widely differen t wav elengths, allo wing much greater sen sitivity. Also , 18 separat e UPT tags have been developed. T he UPT materials are cu rrently under evaluation by the Joint Program Offic e-Bio Defe nse for suitability as a re placem ent to t he fluore scent ta gs in the c urrently fi elded \" Smart Ticket\" se nsors. Enhanc ed Consequenc e Man agement Plannin g and Support System (ENCOM PASS) has been transitioned to the Crisis Co nsequence Man agement Initiativ e (CC MI) labo ratory located at Sp ace an d Naval Warfare Systems Center-San Dieg o, CA (SSC-S D). CC MI is responsible for other DoD projects that involve aerial surveillan ce and intellig ence support. Th e CCMI lab oratory is currently wo rking in cooperatio n with Joint Forces Comman d to in stall th e ENC OMPASS co mponents in supp ort of their mission for Homeland De fense. DAR PA's ENC OMPASS invest ment has led to the development of a com mercially avai lable software program for overall resources m anagem ent for c risis response. Key com ponents of the ENCOMPASS program have been t ested at Pacific Wa rrior and the Air Force Inform ation Warfare BattleLab in San Antonio, TX. In addition, the Air Force's Lightweight Epi demiology Ad vanced Detection a nd Em ergency Response System (LEAD ERS) uses ke y compone nts of ENCOMP ASS and will be installed at Wilford Hall Medical Center and Brooks Air F orce Base, San Antonio, TX. Th e Air Force Su rgeon Gen eral's office is also in the process of i nstallin g LEADERS at Air C ombat Command, L angley, VA, and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC. DARPA h as helped in the development of a n ew Navy tran sition lab oratory, th e Con cept Ex ploration Labo ratory (C XL), th at fo cuses o n techno logy for military medicine. Th is facility i s located at SSC-SD, with expe rts in operational planning from the Naval Heal th Research C enter and SSC -SD. The CXL vision is to become the focal point for al l adva nced m edical technology for testing an d eval uation before prototypes are transitioned to the Fleet. CXL is wo rking closely with the Pacif ic Co mman d to support Cobra Gold in Thailand and the Kern el Blitz Exp erimen t at Cam p Pend leton, CA, in June 2001. The ap plication of fi ber-optic technol ogy to high-capacity data-links f or electronic warfare, ra dar a nd rel ated application s offers a substantial ad vantage in term s of increased d ata-han dling capability an d reduced size an d weight ove r that of exi sting co pper cabl ing. DAR PA's photonics programs have ost ponents that interface elect ronic subsystem s to fiber ca bling. These tec hnologies, such as vertical cavity surface em itting lasers, have resulted in a suite of optoelectronic technologies t hat are being considere d for future insertion into platforms. In pa rticular, the Navy 's Fi beroptic Roadmap initiative and t he Navy 's planned upgrade for the EA -6B aircraft are m aking use of much of t he technology develo ped in th ese DA RPA pho tonics pr ograms. Over the past year, DARPA's Advanced Microelectr onics program has dem onstrated an i mpressi ve array of results fabricatio n n switch ing devices with useful electrical ch aracteristics an d having the world's sho rtest ch annel length (10 nanometers). In addition, this program also de monstrated a fabricati on process that uses only conventi to ce tran features (180 nanometers is current state-of-art in production). These s hort-channel transistors have 36unconventional device stru ctures but are com patible with ultra large-scal e integration into dense in tegrated circu its. Electrical measurem ents show that these new tra nsistors are also very fast, attain ing switch ing speeds in the few picosec onds range, thereby enabling future signal processing chips to operate at speeds on the order of 10s of gigahertz. Se veral other a gencies - t he Nat ional Reconnaissance Office, National Sec urity Agency, and the De fense Threat Reducti on Agency - a re now c ollaborating with the AM E program cont ractors to investigate ap plication s of this na noscale technology. The A nti-Torpedo T orpedo (ATT) is a ne w Na vy approach to coun ter-to rpedo attack that has significan t volume const for cont rol electronics. A MEMS-based T orpedo Exploder package offers the require d perform ance in a vo lume compatible wit h the ATT d esign. The exploder incorporates two MEMS devices that have been devel oped over the past three years , a com bination flow sens or/accelerom eter and an actuator. The ATT ntly undergone two successf ul sea t rials and the Navy has made the decision to continue development. The availab ility o f DARPA's MEMS e xploder was on e key enabler for this Nav y program . In the area of smart munitions, over the past several years t wo co mplimentary DAR PA programs have devel oped MEMS Inerti al Measurement Units (IMUs) for u se in the guidance package for artillery shells. These MEMS IMUs provide re quired g uidance in a sm all package ca pable of withstanding the 50,000 Gs shoc k experienced when the shell is fired. Fo llowing the DAR PA demonstration of th e capab ilities o f the MEMS IMU, both the Navy and Army have programmed fu nds for additional devel opment leading to production. 37 "}
