You becomes systematically aware of your physical body and inner world by following a set of verbal instructions as you mentally scan your body. This state of consciousness is similar to that of a dream state, promoting deep relaxation of our bones and muscles, lowering blood pressure and stress hormones, improving endocrine and immune function, regenerating neurons in the brain, and regenerating our cells. benefits of a Nidra Meditation Supports Endocrine & Immune Functions Supports Regeneration & Repair of Cells Equivalent to 4 hours of R.E.M.

Our Sound Therapy sessions utilize a combination of wind chimes and bowls made of quartz crystal and precious stones to create a relaxed atmosphere aligning our body, mind and spirit to the melodies; raising our vibrational frequency. These practices highlight how the experience of sound manifests not only through hearing but also through tactile physical vibrations and frequencies. benefits of a sound THERAPY Boosts Mood Tune Out Distracting Thoughts Enhances Self Connection Reduces Stress & Anxiety Deeply Relaxing Activates Alpha & Theta Brainwaves + HYPNOBIRTHING Hypnobirthing is a childbirth preparation technique that emphasizes the use of self-hypnosis, relaxation, and breathing techniques to achieve a more comfortable birthing experience. The practice of hypnobirthing is based on the idea that fear and tension during childbirth can cause pain and complications, and that through relaxation and mental preparation, women can have a more positive and empowering birth experience. Overall, hypnobirthing offers an alternative approach to traditional childbirth preparation that empowers women to take an active role in their birthing experience and promotes a sense of calm and confidence during this transformative time. + NEURO-LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING (NLP) Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a powerful tool which can be used to help improve mental health.
