RECEIVING CONSIDERATION FROM A THIRD PARTY FOR PATIENT REFERRAL Sixty-fifth Specification: ( Paragraph M.). FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE RECORDS ( Paragraphs A. and A. and and D. and D. E.. and Paragraphs I. and 1.8.). Nqligence is the failure to exercise the care that would be exercised by a reasonably prudent licensee under the circumstances. 35mns wereutilized by the Hearing Committee during its deliberations:.- Department of Health. This document, entitled \"Definitions of Professional Misconduct Under the New York Education Law\" sets forth suggested definitions for gross negligence, negligence, gross incompetence, incompetence in the practice of medicine and fraud in the practice of medicine.DISCUSSION Respondent was charged with seventy-four specifications alleging professional misconduct within the meaning of Education Law $6530. This statute sets forth numerous forms of conduct which constitute professionalmisconduct, but does not provide definitions of the various types of misconduct. During the course of its deliberations on these charges, the Committee consulted a memorandum prepared by General Counsel for the iS set forth below. 36Dractice is defined as an intentional misrepresentation or concealment of a known fact. An individual's knowledge that he/she is making a misrepresentation or concealing a known fact with the intention to mislead may properly be inferred from certain facts. Using the above-referenced definitions as a framework for its deliberations, the Committee concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the above delineated specifications of professional misconduct should be sustained. The rationale for the Committee's conclusions Incomnetence is an unmitigated lack of the skill or knowledge necessary to perform an act undertaken by the licensee in the practice of medicine. Fraud in the NepliPence is the failure to exercise the care that would be exercised by a reasonably prudent physician under the circumstances, and which failure is manifested by conduct that is egregious or conspicuously bad. Gross IncomDetence is a lack of the skill or knowledge necessary to practice the profession. Gross adju.n&orcon@ementary practice of medicine. In particular the committee found Dr. Bock to very credible. His testimony was not slanted to advocate the Respondent's position but was objective and he was found to be knowledgeable with respect to the Respondent's practice modality. Dr. Baker's credibility was 37becre&bl&ithoseareasinvolving-the Maliha. The Committee found him to be a credible witness. However, they found his medical experience to be limited in both the type of practice that the Respondent is engaged in, namely complementary alternative medicine, and in some cases the type of patient presented, and therefore his testimony with respect to certain areas of that practice and certain patients was discounted. The petitioner also presented Dr. David C. Brittain as a fact witness. Dr. Brittain had conducted an interview of the Respondent and testified about his report of that interview. He was found to be a credible witness. The Respondent presented the testimony of three expert witnesses, Drs. Schachter, Bock and Baker. The Committee found Drs. Bock and Schachter to Maliha is a physician who is board certified in emergency medicine and family medicine. There was no evidence of any bias on the part of Dr.Dr. Maliha, M.D. as its expert witness The Petitioner presented William Maliha repeatedly testified that the Respondent's patient histories, physical examinations, laboratory work-ups, documentation of initial and working diagnoses and the accuracy of the medical records for the patients presented did not meet acceptable standards of medical care. With the few exceptions noted, the Committee found itself in agreement with his testimony relating to the histories, physicals, documentation of initial and working diagnoses and accuracy of records and sustained those charges. With respect to the repeated charge of not adequately evaluating the patients enumerated, the Committee agreed with the Respondent's experts 38CharPeR Dr. Recurring Patient , the GSDL and NSR.questionable as he was found to have a conflict of interest since he hadpreviously treated the patient he testified about which affected his objectivity and in the course of that treatment provided what might be construed as an incorrect diagnosis so that Patient C would be admitted to the hospital. The Respondent also testified on his own behalf. The Committee found him to be well versed in his type of medical practice. At times they felt his testimony was evasive or inconsistent. in particular with respect to the charges relating to coding -be conflicting treatment which may be detrimental to the patient's health unless the patient has specifically prohibited the Respondent from contacting the other physician. The Committee did conclude that in all cases charged, the Respondent sent specimens to the GSDL, when he knew or should have known that it 39.Patients were self-referrals and/or did not present with any life threatening symptoms. Although the Committee did not sustain these charges it felt that the Respondent needs to develop a system which would prompt his conferring with a patient's previous and/or concurrent physician when there is an acute medical issue that the Respondent would not be addressing or if there -that the Respondent's paradigm of using laboratory tests as the method of evaluating each patient was an acceptable practice. As such, the Committee also did not sustain the repeated charge of ordering excessive and/or not medically indicated laboratory tests. The Committee did conclude that the Respondent needs to document his interpretation of the laboratory results. The Committee also determined that the Respondent as an adjunct-care provider did not violate the standards of practice by not consulting with thevarious patients' concurrent or prior treating physicians. The majority of the -Respendent documented diagnostic codes for conditions he did not evaluate or treat, the Committee concurred with the Respondent that with a few exceptions, for those conditions listed, he did an appropriate evaluation and where indicated did treat. Whether or not it was inappropriate to evaluate the patient for some or 40charge &at-the --Withrespect-to&repeated GSDL's lack of certification was not credible. Furthermore, in all cases charged, the Committee concluded that the Respondent did provide erroneous codes to the patients for the purpose of obtaining third party reimbursement and this constituted professional misconduct. The Committee did find all of the Respondent's patients' records to be deficient. Although the Committee believed he spent sufficient time with each patient his documentation was totally inadequate. As a result of thatdeficiency, in each instance where the Respondent made a diagnosis of disseminated systemic candidiasis he failed to document the basis for this diagnosis and therefore those charges were sustained.was not certified by New York to do such tests.

Thus, although the respondent formulated a working and initial diagnosis he did not document it. It was not clear from the recordsICD- 9 codes are not sufficient as working diagnoses in a medical chart and are meant to be used solely for billing purposes. Additionally, the Respondent continued to use some of these codes even after the test results found them inapplicable to the particular patient. Patient all of these conditions was not charged. The Committee notes that the - Respondent did evaluate and found the patient's RBC lead levels, which are the definitive measurement, to be normal. Therefore, there was no obligation to notify the Public Health authorities. The Committee disagreed with the Petitioner's expert and found that the Respondent did not prevent the patient from getting care but rather worked with the patient's other concurrent and prior physicians. He did not refute the other physicians' approach but adopted a different treatment approach without refuting or adopting their diagnosis. The Committee did 42The Committee concluded that the Respondent did not prescribe ciprofloxacin. This was based on the fact that there were no prescriptionsproduced and the corroboration by the patient's mother that the patient was not prescribed this medication. This was not the conclusion the Committee reached with respect to the Respondent prescribing an antihelminthic. The patient record contained no evidence of a parasitic infection to justify prescribing any such substance. The charges relating to the elevated levels of lead were unfounded. The Patient 43the.

As with Patient B the Committee did not find that the Respondent violated the standard of care with respect to the patient's lead levels in his blood for the same reasons cited above. Additionally, in this case although the hair analysis results were elevated, there was a high level of probability of it being a false reading. The Respondent prescribed Nizoral for this patient. Although find that the Respondent failed to document the medical indication for a number of the medications he prescribed for this patient and therefore sustained those charges. Additionally, with respect to Patient C and D the Committee notes there were clerical errors in the diagnostic codes in the patients' records which resulted in the record indicating that the Respondent evaluated these patients for certain conditions for which he did not.

The Respondent was also charged with entering into a scheme with GSDL to permit certain uncertified diagnostic laboratory testing. \"Scheme\" is defined as a plan of action. The Petitioner did not produce any evidence of any plan that the Respondent devised with GSDL to obtain such testing. Additionally, a representative of GSDL testified that when they were advised that some laboratory results generated from samples from New York were being delivered to addresses outside the state they instituted an audit and ceased delivery of test results to those non-New York addresses which were determined to not be actual clinical practices.

The Committee determined that the Respondent's conduct amounted to aconflict of interest which was contrary to accepted standards of practice.

The claim by the Respondent that he never made any profit from this practice is irrelevant.

This determination was reached upon due consideration of the full spectrum of penalties available pursuant to statute, including revocation, suspension and/or probation, censure and reprimand, and the imposition of monetary penalties. The Committee unanimously agreed that the Respondent's license should not be revoked.

Had the Respondent taken the time he could have used legitimate codes for these patients. The Committee felt that the findings relating to the GSDL and NSR which led to sustaining specifications of fraud and moral unfitness convey an aspect of dishonesty in the Respondent.
