The occasional and sudden form is often caused by a Gastro-Intestinal (\"GI\") virus, such as the recent noro-virus, which can also cause purging from the other end of the GI tract, i.e. vomiting. Sudden diarrhea can also be caused by food poisoning, when we eat food that is populated with an organism that irritates the GI tract itself or thro ugh toxins. However, recurrent or persistent diarrhea is a ver y different animal, and as with constipation, it is m ore important than the discomfort that it produces--it represents a serious problem that is both a result and a cause of illness. Previous articles have discussed leaky gut syndrom e, stomach acid and enzymes, and constipation; therefo re this article will only briefly touch upon these concepts and their related GI anatomy and physiology. Persistent diarrhea is a medical emergency because it depletes the body of water and critical minerals (s odium and potassium, amoung others, collectively called \"electrolytes\"). Though we can survive without drin king water for up to a few weeks (depending upon the environmental conditions), because diarrhea so rapi dly depletes us of our internal supply, that serious di arrhea can kill in a matter of days. Until modern medicine discovered bacteria, parasit es, and vaccines, diarrhea was a major cause of illness and death. The increased life expectancy that we all e njoy compared to just 150 years ago is due to public hea lth measures of sanitation and vaccination, which large ly prevent diarrheal illness. Unfortunately, third wo rld countries still have significant morbidity and mort ality due to poor nutrition and sanitation, with consequent d ealth of the young and old from diarrhea. Though the averag e adult is supposed to drink approximately 8 cups of water day, the body pours numerous quarts of fluid and it 's own cells into the GI tract each day to facilitate dige stion. This water is absorbed throughout the small and large in testine, so by the time stool exits the body, there is only 5 ounces this water left. Digestion not only requires huge amounts of fluid; the entire process, including liver function , consumes 25% of our energy. This is why most creatures, whe n ill, lose their appetite--it is done to preserve energy and water. (So our mothers were wrong, eating while very sick does not help us heal, with the possible exception of th in fluids such as chicken soup!) The body also loses water through the skin and uri ne, but it works hard to limit this loss, and will shut down these functions in cases of dehydration. In extreme cases of diarrhea, where the lining of the GI tract is damaged, blood and mucus also appears in t he stool. This is usually called colitis, or Inflammatory Bow el Disease (\"IBD\"). Modern medicine breaks colitis in to two forms--Crohns Disease, which can affect the entire GI tract, and Ulcerative Colitis which usually affects the co lon. In addition, many people have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or \"IBS\", which is not inflammatory. Whil e classic IBS involves alternating diarrhea and const ipation, some people have more of one or the other. While Modern Medicine makes a distinction between all of these conditions, Holistic Medicine finds th ese distinctions somewhat arbitrary. In many cases, pe ople progress from one to the other. IBD has an auto-im mune aspect, where a confused immune system attacks the GI tract. In many cases, there is a family history of auto-immune disease. However, genetics determine only 2 0% of our health--our lifestyles dominate by turning the bad and good genes on and off. We know this from identical twin studies, where twins have different disease profile s based on life factors. Fortunately, the holistic approac h to colitis largely overlaps with the holistic treatment for au toimmune disease, so there can be healing of both (and other ) conditions simultaneously. Why Diarrhea? The body's reason for diarrhea is often simple--it can't or doesn't want to handle what is in the bowel. Th e same usually goes with vomiting. Assuming that the body is wiser than our mind (modern man's mind is only 50- 100,000 years old; our digestive wisdom is hundreds of millions of years old), we should acknowledge and b e thankful for the message that our inner wisdom prov ides. However, because the symptoms of diarrhea are inconvenient and at times disabling, Modern Medicin e, as it does with many conditions, has developed drugs that suppress diarrhea. This may be OK for a business t rip or other time-limited issue, but to chronically use a suppressive often allows the root cause to be misse d until the diarrhea spirals into a relentless, non-respons ive misery. In such cases, desperate patients agree to have sec tions of their bowels surgically removed. Holistic Approach Any treatment that is complex and dangerous reeks of manipulation; whereas a treatment that is simple an d elegant suggests that the root cause is being addre ssed. The holistic approach for diarrhea and colitis is relat ively simple. It assumes that there are toxins that need to be eliminated, deficiencies that need to be corrected, and then repairs the GI tract's lining and ecology. This ap proach is successful in up to 90% of patients. The approach sometimes begins with diagnostic test s; other times, when the story and situation are strai ght- forward, treatment can begin rapidly, and the respo nse (or non-response) to the treatment can validate the ass essment or indicate a need for further testing. While a conventional stool test can sometimes iden tify bad bacteria, yeast or parasites, there are limitat ions to the stool test. First of all, one or two stool samples may not yield sufficient quantities of the offending organi sm. Secondly, for some species, the lab technician must sift through the sample, looking for parasites or eggs. This job qualifies for the TV show \"World's Dirtiest Jobs\". Depending upon the diligence and experience of the technician and quality of the sample, parasites may or may not be found. Thirdly, the lower colon has little oxygen in its contents\u2014most of the species living there are d esigned to live with little oxygen--called anaerobic organi sms. Therefore, when a stool sample is exposed to the ai r, some of these organisms can perish or be significantly s uppressed to limit detection. Lastly, it is hard to quantify the ratio of good to bad bacteria or yeast based on a sample. S ince there is always some, detecting bad bacteria or yea st may or may not have any meaning. There are ways around these limitations. Firstly, one lab has developed a test using DNA amplification, t he same method used by CSI's to magnify the DNA found in a fingerprint or other small sample. In such a case, the 3/3/09-2 diarr_ab.wpf \"Diarrhea, IBS and Colitis\" M Cheikin MD Page 2 organism doesn't need to be found, only it's DNA. In another test, the urine is tested for markers that are produced by \"bad\" bacterial and yeast species and i f present, represent significant presence and toxicit y. However, the absence of such markers does not fully rule out these organisms. This special urine test also looks for markers for good bacteria, and if decreased, sugges ts the need for \"pro-biotics\". Holistic Treatment So, whether the tests are done first, or saved til l later, treatment is initiated with natural agents, and the response provides additional diagnostic information. The toxins that need to be considered include: bac teria, yeast, parasites, certain foods, chemical toxins, a nd emotional/energetic toxicity. The deficiencies that need to be addressed include critical vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and oils that are needed for the body to repair the lining of the gut , to enable the immune system to mount an attack when there are offending organisms, and/or to suppress the immune system when it attacks the GI tract. It is almost always effective to begin with \"pro-b iotic\" bacteria and yeast. These are the good organisms t hat can re-populate the GI tract and push out the bad organ isms. It is also important to remove known toxins from t he diet and lifestyle--which include hydrogenated oils , artificial sweeteners, caffeine, alcohol, cigarette smoke, pesticides, preservatives, colorants, and cosmetics (which are absorbed through the skin). Foods that are kno wn to be allergenic should be removed, which include at leas t, all dairy, gluten, soy and nightshades. Since food all ergy is a hidden but very prevalent condition, and in allergy the body can react to a single molecule, it is not sufficien t to remove most of these foods--they must be totally eliminated, for a while at least. Some allergens persist for months. Once the situation is stable, missed foods can be re-int roduced one at a time to observe whether there is a reactio n. Special mention should be made of Celiac Disease a nd gluten sensitivity (\"GS\"). Gluten is a family of p roteins which are in different amounts in most grains, most ly wheat, spelt, rye, barley, and oat. Some people in herit a genetic sensitivity to glutens--and consumption of gluten will trigger an auto-immune reaction to the gut lin ing. Up to 90% of GS goes undiagnosed, and sometimes the te sts are falsely negative (i.e. the person has GS but th e test says there is none). Therefore, eliminating all grains except rice and quinoa is strongly advocated. Some people have sensitivities to foods without having a frank immun e response, sometimes called food intolerance. This situation will be discussed in a future article. The last toxin that needs to be briefly addressed are heavy metals such as lead and mercury, which though subtle, can alter immune, hormonal and nerve cell f unction an be a hidden cause of any disease. Often, these measures alone will make a significan t difference. Identifying and correcting deficiencie s of critical nutrients, through supplementation, if tol erated, is an important component of healing. Important suppl ements include glutamine, fish oils, gamma linoleic acid ( an anti- inflammatory omega-6 oil), vitamin D, and others. Sleep should be considered a nutrient that needs sufficie nt quality and quantity. Additional measures include the adding of \"pre- biotics\", compounds that support the GI lining and the good bacteria that populates the gut. In addition, when the lower GI tract is dysfunctio nal, it can reflect and/or cause dysfunction of the stomach , pancreas, gallbladder and upper GI tract. Addition of digestive acid and enzymes (under the supervision o f a properly trained practitioner) can be a critical co mponent of healing. Supporting the body's detoxification syst ems through special supplements can also be necessary. Chronic illness can cause adrenal fatigue; testing and or treatment may be indicated early or late in the pro cess based on numerous considerations--see the article o n this topic published previously. Lastly, the energetic aspects of the gut should al ways be considered. In Ayurvedic (Indian) and Chinese medicine, the colon has a significant relationship to emotional and spiritual themes of control, survival , obsession, anxiety, grief and depression. A remark able healing has been experienced by numerous \"unrespons ive\" patients by the addition of yoga, acupuncture and o ther specific energy treatments. There are additional tests and measures that are i n the tool box of the holistic practitioner. Most cases of diarrhea and colitis can be healed, even after decades, if t hese principles are applied systematically in a collabor ative relationship between a patient and holistic practit ioner.
