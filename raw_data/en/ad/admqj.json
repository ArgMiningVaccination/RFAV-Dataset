Benefits of Chiropractic Care Chiropractic care has many benefits for patients suffering from chronic pain and other health conditions. These benefits include: Muscle Flexibility: Regular chiropractic adjustments can help increase joint and muscle flexibility, improving mobility and the ease of daily activities. Athletes benefit more from the procedure because it improves their performance. Affordability - Compared to traditional medical care, chiropractic manipulation is a more affordable treatment option for chronic back, shoulder, and neck pain. For one thing, no medications are required before, during, or after the chiropractic spinal adjustments, which saves a significant amount of money on one's treatment budget. Faster Relief - Chiropractic care is needed to relieve acute and chronic back and neck pain. Typical adjustments can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. Because your body's needs are being assessed, your first appointment may last longer. People who receive chiropractic care report that they recover faster than those who use traditional medical solutions. Reduced Blood Pressure - Chiropractors can significantly help patients with high blood pressure who do not want to take medications. Patients' blood pressure levels can be dramatically reduced by targeting the cervical spine or neck during spinal adjustments. Reduced Allergies - Misalignment of the spine can disrupt brain signals, resulting in an irregular immune response. Multiple allergies are caused by signal interference. Chiropractic therapy can realign the spine to improve communication with the brain and regulate allergic reactions. Relief from Multiple Pains - Chiropractic care can help relieve pain in the neck, back, shoulders, feet, ankles, arms, shoulders, wrists, and other areas of the body. It can also help with stress, arthritis, joint pain, and discomfort, among other things. Athletes suffering from injuries can also benefit from chiropractic adjustments. Our Process and the Journey to Recovery Our process and journey to recovery for patients come in three stages. They include: Consultation and Examination We provide chiropractic solutions by performing a physical examination of your body to understand the uniqueness of your condition when you visit Metro Healthcare Partners. This examination will help us decide on a chiropractic solution/procedure that will be effective for your body. Our expert chiropractors will also talk with you about how you feel, where it hurts the most, and how it's affecting your daily life. During this time, our doctors can also review your medical history. Pain Relief Our expert chiropractors will provide a unique or general solution to your problem after understanding the specifics of your health condition, and you may feel better immediately or hours later. A spinal adjustment can often clear an obstruction in the communication pathway between the brain and the body, allowing the body to heal itself. Recovery After the procedure is completed and your pain is relieved, you must return to our chiropractic office for regular weekly checkups. Our chiropractors will provide you with a treatment plan that includes exercises, home therapies, and a diet plan you should follow. This plan will promote total body wellness while also relieving pain. The visits could be twice weekly or once a month, but in chiropractic medicine, saying goodbye to your chiropractor once the pain is gone is not ideal. Why Choose Us?

Chiropractic Care for Car Accident Injuries According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, [over 5.2 million non-fatal car accidents occurred in the country in 2020](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/813266), with almost 2.3 million people sustaining injuries from these collisions. Even minor fender benders can cause major back and neck pain that starts within hours or days of an accident. Regular visits with an experienced chiropractor can help you recover quickly with significantly less pain. Metro Healthcare Partners offers [multi-specialty healthcare services in Brooklyn](https://www.metrohealthnyc.com/services/), NY, including chiropractic, orthopedic, and neurological care. Below, our team shares details about chiropractic services for work and non-work-related auto crash injuries. Common Injuries From Car Accidents Though vehicle collisions are incredibly common in the U.S., the injuries they cause vary from person to person. For example, a person could have bone fractures from the crash's impact, whereas someone else could have cuts from broken window glass and bruising due to seatbelt and airbag impact. Not every injury requires a chiropractor. Still, most people find chiropractic treatments like spinal manipulation, muscle relaxation, and targeted exercises for the following conditions beneficial for their long-term recovery. Whiplash Cervical spine injuries from car accidents contribute to an estimated 869,000 cases, with [whiplash accounting for over 840,000 of those injuries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457520300713). Whiplash is an impact injury to the back, shoulders, or neck that occurs when your head jolts quickly in one direction. It can occur if your car crashes into another vehicle or object and if you brake suddenly. Within a few days of a car accident, you might experience neck pain with a limited range of motion if you have whiplash. Upper arm pain and headaches are other symptoms of the condition. Muscle, Ligament, and Nerve Pain The force of a vehicular collision can cause spinal injuries like muscle, ligament, and nerve pain. Through targeted spinal manipulation and other treatment plans, a chiropractor can relieve pain from back injuries that could trigger pain or discomfort throughout your body. Herniated Discs Sometimes, car accidents can push intervertebral discs out of place. The discs are the soft cushions between spinal bones that help you move and twist. A sudden force pushing a disc out of alignment could cause substantial back pain and reduced mobility. How a Chiropractor Can Help You After a Car Accident Because chiropractors provide alternative medical care for musculoskeletal injuries, like repetitive strain and soft tissue injuries, chiropractic care could address many problems stemming from car accident injuries. A seasoned chiropractor has the training and expertise to treat the whole body after a traumatic experience like an auto crash or an accident on the job. With the right chiropractic care after an accident, you could experience several benefits, such as the following: - Inflammation reduction: Chiropractic treatments can help reduce inflammation, which is the painful swelling around injured muscles. These treatments put the body back into alignment and lower white blood cell production around the injury, allowing its swelling to subside. - Limited dependency on medication: Some people use medication for pain management after an accident. Chiropractic care offers drug-free pain relief. - Range of motion and flexibility improvements: Chiropractors focus on patients' injured limbs or muscles, allowing for a marked improvement in their range of motion and flexibility. - Pain relief: Because chiropractors understand how spinal misalignment can cause pain throughout the body, they work to relieve aches and discomfort by targeting the pain at its source instead of treating its symptoms. Can a Chiropractor Help You After a Work-Related Injury? A car accident chiropractor can help you recover after a car crash, whether the event occurs in a company vehicle or private transportation. So, can chiropractic care help you after sustaining other work-related injuries? The short answer is yes. Each profession creates risks to employees, even office jobs. Repetitive bodily movements, negligence, unsafe working conditions, and an employer's failure to accommodate workers' safety can lead to serious workplace injuries. For instance, a person could get into a car accident while working if their employer fails to maintain the vehicle's upkeep or if another driver hits the company car. Chiropractors can create individualized treatment plans for various conditions to help people recover from work-related injuries, including the following: - Headaches due to workplaces accidents, poor posture, or muscle tension - Carpal tunnel and other repetitive motion conditions - Slip and falls - Tendinitis - Rotator cuff injuries - Back and neck pain [Up to 90% of serious workplace injuries are caused by human error](https://www.jjkellersafety.com/news-articles/Preventing-human-error-in-the-workplace#:~:text=According%20to%20recent%20studies%2C%2080,are%20caused%20by%20human%20error.), according to recent studies.
