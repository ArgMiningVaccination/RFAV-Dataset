The printed copy of the Chronic Pain Guidelines may be updated before the next edition is printed. All updates will b e posted on the electronic version. Link: https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/healthprofboards/ChronicPainGuidelines.pdf Last revised: January 2020 TENNESSEE CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC NON -MALIGNANT PAIN The purpose of these guidelines is to define appropriate treatment of chronic pain, a common and often serious condition. We want to foster timely and appropriate treatment for pain, which improves both the ability to function and quality of life. These guidelines are intended to be used to support clinicians in their treatment of patients with chronic pain with particular reference to the prescribing of opioid medications. We want to avoid addiction and adverse outcomes. Optimal treatment of chronic pain, defined as pain lasting longer than 90 days, is an interdisciplinary process that includes many interve ntions which do not always involve opioid pain medications. The method used to formulate these guidelines included a review of national expert panel recommendations and state practice guidelines, multiple listening sessions with clinicians in Tennessee, oversight by a multidisciplinary steering committee and recommendations from an advisory committee with strong representation by clinicians with specialty training in pain medicine. Draft clinical guidelines were also circulated to a broader group of profess ional associations within Tennessee, including but not limited to mental health and substance abuse and work ers' compensation programs. The importance of management of chronic pain is apparent by the following facts: In 2018, Tennessee continues to rank in Top 10 per capita prescription rate for opioids in the US. Unintentional overdose deaths increased to 1, 818 (from 1,776 in 2017 ), in spite of declining MMEs. This exceed s deaths due to motor vehicle accidents, homicide or suicide in 2018. The number of babies born dependent on drugs who suffered from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) declined by approximately 17%, for the first time in almost 10 years . In 2019, the decline continues. In the midst of this Substance Use Disorder epidemic, chronic pain is likewise a significant public health problem. At least 116 million US adults \u2014more than the number affected by heart disease, diabetes and cancer combined \u2014suffer from common chronic pain conditions. The long term goals of appropriate pain management are to improve symptoms, function and overall quality of life while minimizing adverse effects, addiction, overdose deaths and NAS. These guidelines can help providers reduce problems associated with prescription opiates while maintaining access to compassionate care and appropriate medications for patients living with chronic pain. These guidelines are organized into three sections and appendices contain additional tools and guidance. The guidelines apply to all healthcare providers. These guidelines would not apply to patients in a hospice program or in a palliative care setting with a life expectancy of six months or less. These guidelines do not apply to patients admitted to a hospital. These guidelines are not meant to dictate medical decision making. They are guidelines of generally accepted medical practice rather than absolutes. Providers still have flexibility to deal with exceptional cases. Occasional deviation from these guidelines for appropriate medical reasons is to be expected and documented.

I: Prior t o Initiating Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non -Malignant Pain SEC SECTION I: PRIOR TO INITIATING OPIOID THERAPY FOR CHRONIC NON -MALIGNANT PAIN Chronic Pain Guidelines 1 Version 3TR - 2020 A. Key Principles Prior to Initiating Opioid Therapy 1. A patient having been prescribed opioids by a previous provider is not, in and of itself, a reason to continue opioids. 2. Reasonable non-opioid treatments should be tried before opioids are initiated. Opio ids should be initiated only after other reasonable, appropriate and available treatments for the pain condition have been considered. 3. All newly pregnant women should have a urine drug test administered by the appropriate women's health provider. 4. The provi der should discuss a birth control plan to prevent unintended pregnancy with every woman of child-bearing age who has reproductive capacity when opioids are initiated. 5. The patient's medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging results, electro -physiologic testing, and other elements supporting the plan of care, should be documented in the medical record prior to initiating opioid therapy. 6. Chronic pain shall not be treated by the use of controlled substances through telemedicine. B. Initial Evaluation: Steps Prior to Initiating Trial of Opioid Therapy 1. A specific evaluation and history of the patient's pain condition should be obtained. The examination should include the nature and intensity of the pain, past and current treatments for pain, a ny co-occurring disorders and the effect of the pain on the patient's life functioning, including but not limited to work, relationships, recreation and sleep. 2. The presence of important co-morbid medical conditions should be assessed and considered when deciding whether to initiate opioids. This includes age of the patient and medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, diabetes or congestive heart failure. 3. An initial, condition -appropriate physical examination of the patient should be conducted. A systems review shall be conducted as well. 4. The possible presence of co-occurring mental health disorders should be considered when deciding whether to initiate a trial of opioids. Screening should occur for disorders such as depression, anxiety and current or past Substance Use Disorder and, if present, these should be addressed in the creation of a treatment plan (See Mental Health Appendi x). 5. A review of prior records directly related to the patient's chronic pain condition is encouraged before opioids are prescribed. 6. Women of child-bearing age who have reproductive capacity should be asked about the possibility of pregnancy at each visit. For women who wish to avoid unintended pregnancy, use of long-acting reversible contraceptiv es should be discussed, or referral to appropriate high-risk obstetrician made (See Women of Child Bearing Age Appendi x and Pregnant Women Appendi x). SECTION I: PRIOR TO INITIATING OPIOID THERAPY FOR CHRONIC NON -MALIGNANT PAIN Chronic Pain Guidelines 2 Version 3TR - 2020 C. Establishing a Diagnosis There shall be the establishment of a current diagnosis that justifies a need for opioid medications. D. Assessment of Risk for Abuse 1. The prescriber shall assess the patient's risk for misuse, abuse, diversion and addiction using a validated risk assessment tool prior to initiating opioid therapy. (See Risk Assessment Tools Appendix) 2. The prescriber should obtain a Urine Drug Test (UDT) (or a comparable test on oral fluids) prior to initiating opioid therapy. (See Urine Drug Testing Appendix) 3. Based on the combined information of the validated risk assessment results, the Controlled Substan ces Monitoring Database (CSMD) results and the UDT results and past records, an initial assessment should be made about a patient's risk of misuse, abuse or diversion of medications. The prescribing of opioids, if medically indicated, shall take this risk assessment information into account in the prescribing of opioids and the patient's treatment plan. (See CSMD Appendix) E. Goals for Treatment 1. The primary goal of treatment should be clinically significant improvement in function. 2. A treatment plan should be d eveloped at the onset of treatment and is expected to include other treatments or modalities beyond opioids, both non-pharmacological and pharmacological. The provider should make reasonable attempts to implement this treatment plan, allowing for barriers such as finances, accessibility and resource distribution. 3. Treatment Plans should establish treatment goals with all patients, including realistic goals for pain and function. One widely used assessment is the 3- item PEG Assessment Scale Pain average Interference with Enjoyment of life Interference with General Activity 4. The patient should be counseled that the goal of chronic opioid therapy is to increase function and reduce pain, not to eliminate pain. Documentation of this discussion shall be included in the medical record.SECTION II: Chronic Pain Guidelines 3 Version 3TR - 2020 Initiating Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non - Malignant Pain CTIO NON -MA Section II: Initiating Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non -Malignant Pain Chronic Pain Guidelines 3 Version 3TR - 2020 A. Key Principles When Considering Prescribing Opioids. 1. National data suggest s risk of overdose death starts at 40 MEDD in opioid naive patients with the greatest risk in th e population is in the first two weeks of treatment. The risk of overdose for all patient populations increases tenfold at 100 MEDD. Tennessee data suggests the tenfold risk may start closer to 81MEDD. 2. When opioids are used for acute pain, clinic ians should prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate -release opioids and should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. Three days or less will often be sufficient; more than sev en days in some instances is appropriate and shall be documented in the medical record. 3. When starting opioid therapy as a primary care provider for chronic pain, clinicians should generally prescribe immediate -release opioids instead of extended -release o r long acting opioids. Some deviations are expected and the reason should be documented. 4. Any product containing buprenorphine, whether with or without naloxone, may only be prescribed for a use recognized by the federal food and drug administration. Unless there is a documented diagnosis of opiate addiction in medical record, the patient received treatment from a provider practicing under a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 823(g)(2) and who is counted toward the total of number of patients set forth in that statute. 5. Benzodiaze pines should be generally avoided in combination with chronic opioid therapy. When the opioid dose reaches 120mg MEDD and the benzodiazepines are being used for mental health purposes, the provider shall refer to a mental health professional to assess necessity of benzodiazepine medication. 6. Buprenorphine/naloxone combinations shall be avoided for the treatment of chronic pain. 7. Although Methadone is a viable treatment option, it should be reserved for the treatment of addiction . However, Methadone may be use d by a pain specialist for treatment of pain. A pain specialist should understand the complexities of Methadone. The decision to treat should consider all available treatments . 8. Should treatment deviate from recommended guidelines, the reasons shall be docu mented in the medical record. B. Upon Initiating Opioid Therapy 1. The initiation of opioids should be presented to the patient as a therapeutic trial. 2. When initiating opioid therapy, the lowest dose of opioids should be given to an opioid - na\u00efve patient and then titrated to effect. 3. Informed consent for the use of opioids in treating pain must be obtained prior to initiating treatment. Informed consent documents typically cover: potential risks and anticipated benefits of opioid therapy, potential side effects, likelihood of physical dependence, risk of over-sedation, pregnancy, risk of impaired motor skills, risk of addiction and death. (See Sample Informed Consent Appendix) 4. A written treatment agreement should be used with the patient at the time opioids are first prescribed for chronic pain. Treatment agreements typically cover reasons, for which opioids may be discontinued, the practice policy on early refills, policy on lost Section II: Initiating Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non -Malignant Pain Chronic Pain Guidelines 4 Version 3TR - 2020 prescriptions or medications, expectation for safe storage of medications, use of one pharmacy and expectations about periodic drug testing. The treatment agreement shall include an expectation that a female patient will tell the provider if she wishes to avoid unintended pregnancy and if she becomes pregnant. (See Sample Patient Agreement Appendix) 5. As these new guidelines are implemented, practitioners may provide a bridge of opioids for up to six months while the assessment process is carried out. During this time a patient may be continued on a trial of opioids without a fully completed assessment. No provider is obligated to continue opioid therapy that has been initiated by another provider. If the initial evaluation of the patient does not support the need for opioids, a discussion about risks and possible treatment of withdrawal shall be included in the documentation of clinical reasoning for opioid cessation. 6. Providers must continually monitor the patient for signs of abuse, misuse or diversion. An unannounced UDT (or a comparable oral fluids test) should be done twice a year at a minimum. (See Urine Drug Testing Appendix) . C. Women's Health 1. The provider should discuss a method to prevent unintended pregnancy with every woman of child-bearing age who has reproductive capacity before opioids are initiated. 2. The practitioner should obtain a signature indicating that any woman who wishes to become or is at risk to become pregnant has been educated about the risks and benefits of opioid treatment during her pregnancy. 3. Women of child-bearing age who have reproductive capacity shall undergo a pregnancy test prior to the initiation of opioids. 4. Women of child-bearing age who have reproductive capacity should be asked about the possibility of pregnancy at each visit. For women who wish to avoid unintended pregnancy, use of long acting reversible contr aceptives should be discussed, or referral to appropriate high risk obstetrician made. (See Women of Child Bearing Age Appendix and Pregnant Women Appendix ). SECTION III: Ongoing Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non - Malignant Pain SECTION III: SECTION III: ONGOING OPIOID THERAPY FOR CHRONIC NON - MALIGNANT PAIN Chronic Pain Guidelines 5 Version 3TR - 2020 A. Key Principles 1. All chronic opioid therapy should be handled by a single provider or practice and all prescriptions should be filled in a single pharmacy, unless the provider is informed and agrees that the patient can go to another pharmacy for a specific reason. 2. Opioids should be used at the lowest effective dose. 3. A provider should not use more than one short -acting opiate concurrently. If a provider deems it necessary to do so then the medical reasons shall be clearly documented. Documentation of the discussion of the five A's (analgesia, activities of daily living, adverse side effects, aberrant drug-taking behaviors and affect) at initiation of chronic opioid therapy and at follow up visits shall be included in the medical record B. Ongoing Therapy 1. Patients on opioid doses of 120mg MEDD or greater should be referred to a pain specialist for a consultation and/or management. If a provider cannot make the required consultation as outlined above, then he/she shall clearly document why not. 2. Clinicians should review the patient's history of controll ed substance prescriptions using the Controlled Substance Monitoring Database (CSMD) data to determine whether the patients receiving opioid dosages or potentially dangerous combinations 3. Providers must continually monitor the patient for signs of abuse, misuse or diversion. A UDT (or a comparable oral fluids screen or test) should be done twice a year at a minimum. (See Urine Drug Testing Appendices) 4. Based on the combined information of patient behavior, collateral information, the CSMD results, the UDT (or Oral Fluids Test) results and past records, an ongoing risk assessment should be made about a patient's risk of misuse, abuse or diversion of medications. The prescribing of opioids, if medically indicated, shall take this risk assessment information into account on an ongoing basis. Adjustments to the patient's treatment should occur in a timely manner based on this information . Inconsistent results from the treatment plan should be addressed immediately and documented action taken as appropriate. 5. Emer gency department physicians should keep the specialist and the primary care provider informed about changes in a patient's condition and any emergent incidents or conditions. 6. Opioids are to be discontinued when the risks, side effects, lack of efficacy or presence of medication or aberrant behavior outweigh the benefits. Opioids sometimes have to be discontinued due to financial or third-party coverage issues. A taper of opioids may or may not be indicated, depending on the clinical situation. (see Tapering Protocol Appendix) 7. Appropriate documentation of CSMD query should be included in the medical record. (see CSMD Appendix) 8. Clinicians should offer or arrange evidence based treatment for patients with substance use disorder . Referral to an Addiction Special ist may be appropriate in some cases. C. Women's Health 1. The provider should discuss a method to prevent unintended pregnancy with every woman of child-bearing age who has reproductive capacity when opioids are initiated. (See Women of Child Bearing Age Appen dix and Pregnant Women Appendix ) SECTION III: ONGOING OPIOID THERAPY FOR CHRONIC NON - MALIGNANT PAIN Chronic Pain Guidelines 6 Version 3TR - 2020 2. The provider shall advise every woman of child-bearing potential on opioids that she be on a method to prevent unintended pregnancy specifically considering long acting contraceptive methods. 3. The treatment agreement shall include an expectation that a female patient will tell the provider if she becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant. 4. If she plans to become or becomes pregnant she shall be referred to an obstetrician. 5. When a UDT is performed, results must be documented in the medical record. The appendices that follow contain specific references from the guidelines as well as other pertinent information about the resources available in the State of Tennessee concerning Substance Use Disorder, the efforts to curb overdose death and other support systems centered around these topics . APPENDICES 7 CORE COMPETENCIES In early 2018, a group of presidents, chancellors and deans from some of Tennessee's medical educational institutions met with Governor Haslam to discuss each institution's efforts to address the opioid epidem ic. There was consensus among the group that curricula may need to be reassessed given new research on the impact of opioids. These individuals also supported the idea of a commission and helped nominate members to what became the Commission on Pain and Ad diction Medicine education. Members of the Commission, appointed by the Governor, represented a broad range of medical fields, specialties and associations across Tennessee including: Representatives from the Tennessee Academy of Physician Assistants, Te nnessee Association of Nurse Anesthetists, Tennessee Dental Association, Tennessee Hospital Association, Tennessee Medical Association, Tennessee Nurses Association, and the Tennessee Pain Society; Deans or their designees of DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine at Lincoln Memorial University, East Tennessee State University Quillen School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, Tennessee Health Science Center, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center; Professors in a Tennessee dental school, a pharmacy sch ool, a physician assistant training program, a nursing school, and a veterinary school; a licensed pharmacist; and the Tennessee Commissioner of Health. The Governor charged the Commission with the development of 12 competencies for current and future curricula so that future prescribers receive instruction and training regarding, at a minimum: Effective treatment for acute and chronic pain, including alternatives to opioids to manage pain; The potential risks and effects of using opioids to treat pain, i ncluding physical dependency and addiction, and effective discontinuation of opioids; Proper identification of and treatment for patients demonstrating misuse or abuse of opioids; and Utilization of the Controlled Substance Monitoring Database Below you w ill find a list of the 12 core competencies developed by the Commission on Pain and Addiction Medicine Education.

CIES APPENDICES 11 TN TOGETHER A comprehensive plan to end the opioid crisis in Tennessee TN Together is a multi -faceted plan, comprised of legislation, more than $30 million (state and federal funds) through Governor Haslam's 2018 -19 budget and other executive actions to attack the state's opioid epidemic through three major components: 1) Prevention, 2) Treatment and 3) Law Enforcement. Prevention Through reasonable limits and appropriate exceptions, decreases supply and dosage of prescription opioids - initial opioid prescriptions will be limited to a three -day supply Implements a public awareness campaign to raise awareness about the potential dangers of opioid use and provides resources and support to those struggling with addiction Identifies wom en of childbearing age who are chronic opioid users and provides targeted outreach about risks, contraception and treatment in order to aid in the prevention of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) births Establishes a commission to formulate current, evi denced -based pain and addiction medicine competencies for adoption by medical and health practitioner schools Treatment Provides more than $26 million in funding (state and federal) for treatment and recovery services for individuals with opioid use disorder. Improves data access and sharing to better and more timely identify critical hotspots for targeting resources and to increase information about patient and community risks Creates a statewide public/private treatment collaborative to collec tively serve Tennesseans who are struggling with opioid addiction Provides funding to the state's zero to three court programs for transportation needs relative to therapeutic and family support services Law Enforcement Increases state funding to attack the illicit sale and trafficking of opioids through additional law enforcement agents and training Updates the controlled substance schedules to better track, monitor and penalize the use and unlawful distribution of dangerous and addictive drugs including fentanyl analogues Provides every Tennessee state trooper with naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose prior to paramedic arrival Find out more at www.tntogether.comAPPENDICES Chronic Pain Guidelines 12 Version 3TR - 2020 PAIN MEDICINE SPECIALIST Pain Medicine is the medical specialty dedicated to the prevention, evaluation and treatment of people with chronic pain. While most Physicians, Advanced Practice Nurses, and Physicians Assistants have training and experience in the management of chronic pain, Pain Medicine Specialist s have fellowship training from ABMS , AOA, or additional training in pain medicine sufficient to obtain ABPM diplomat status. Current protocols regarding the delineation of prescribing authority to and supervision of Advanced Practice Nurses with certifica te of fitness for prescribing and Physicians Assistants for prescribing to treat chronic pain continue to apply. Pain Medicine Specialists deal with patients being treated with more than 120 milligram morphine equivalents daily dose because they are at least eleven times more likely to suffer an adverse effect including overdose death. The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) are the primary physician certification organization s in the United States. The ABMS and the AOA assist 24 boards in grant ing certificates in 124 specialty and subspecialty areas. The AOA assists 18 boards in granting certificates in 57 specialty and subspecialty areas. The ABMS certifies pain medicine fellowship programs that res ult in subspecialty certification in Pain Medicine are under the Boards of Anesthesiology, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Psychiatry and Neurology. The American Board of Pain Medicine (ABPM) is not affiliated with the ABMS or the AOA and does not over see fellowship training programs. The ABPM administers practice -related examination for Pain Medicine to qualified candidates who have achieved specified requirements in graduate medical education, licensure and controlled substances authorization, ABMS bo ard certification (not necessarily in pain management), practice experience, continuing medical education, and adherence to ethical and professional standards. Diplomats of ABPM have certification in Pain Medicine. The State of Tennessee sets forth two tiers for the treatment of pain management: Tier 1 Non -Pain Medicine Specialist: 1. All providers who wish to treat patients requiring less than 120 milligram morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) shall: a. Hold a valid Tennessee license issued by their respective board through the Department of Health and a current DEA certification. b. Attend Continuing Education pertinent to pain management as directed by their governing board. c. We recommend, but do not require, that providers have completed three years of residency training and be ABMS or AOA board eligible or board certified. 2. All providers wishing to treat patients requiring 120 MEDD or more shall consult with a Pain Medicine Specialist. 3. Providers treating patients with ongoing opioid therapy (prescribing of 120MEDD for more than six months in any calendar year) shall obtain at least one annual consultation with a Pain Medicine Specialist. Patients with more complicated cases may require more frequent consultation. APPENDICES 13 Tier 2 Pain Medicine Specialists: A Pain Medicine Specialist is defined by T.C.A. \u00a7 63 -1-301(9) as: 1. Has a subspecialty certification in pain medicine as accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) through either the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) o r the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), or is eligible to sit for the board examination offered by ABMS or AOA; a. Holds an unencumbered Tennessee license; and b. Maintains the minimum number of continuing medical education (CME) hours in pain management t o satisfy retention of ABMS or AOA certification. Any exceptions to this requirement shall be approved by the respective regulatory board; 2. Attains American Board of Pain Medicine (ABPM) diplomate status; a. Holds an unencumbered Tennessee license; and b. Maintai ns the minimum number of CME hours in pain management to satisfy retention of ABPM diplomate status. Any exceptions to this requirement shall be approved by the respective regulatory board; 3. Is board certified by the American Board of interventional Pain Ph ysicians (ABIPP) by passing exam 1 on or before June 30, 2016, and holds an unencumbered Tennessee license and maintains the minimum number of CME hours in pain management to satisfy retention of ABIPP diplomate status; provided, that on and after July 1, 2016, a new applicant shall only qualify as a pain management specialist under this subdivision (9)(C) if the applicant is board certified by the American Board of Interventional Pain Physicians (ABIPP) by passing parts 1 and 2 of its examination, and hold s an unencumbered Tennessee license and maintains the minimum number of CME hours in pain management to satisfy retention of ABIPP diplomate status; or 4. Has an active pain management practice in a clinic accredited in outpatient interdisciplinary pain rehab ilitation by the commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities or any successor organization and holds an unencumbered Tennessee license. It should be noted that should Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 63 -1-301(9) change the law would render any part of these guidelines obsolete upon taking effect. APPENDICES 14 MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT TOOLS There are several validated mental health screening and assessment tools available for use by physicians and healthcare professionals. Below are some names and links to these. 1. Patient Health Questionnaire - 2 (PHQ -2). This is a simple two -item screening tool. If it is positive on either item, the clinician should offer another more detailed questionnaire to better assess the presence or absence of a depressive disorder. One link to this screening tool: http://www.cqaimh.org/pdf/tool_phq2.pdf . 2. Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ -9). This nine -item tool screens for a depressive disorder, and often is used as a follow -up to th e PHQ -2. It's easy to score and use. Here 's one link to a copy: http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/images/res/PHQ%20 -%20Questions.pdf . 3. Zung Self -Rating Depression Scale (Zung). This is a 20 -item written questionnaire. One copy is at http://healthnet.umassmed.edu/mhealth/ZungSelfRatedDepressionScale.pdf . 4. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham -D). This is 21 -item screening questionnaire. Cutoff scores <7 is normal. http://img.medscape.com/pi/emed/ckb/psychiatry/79926 -1889862 -1859039 -2124408.pdf 5. A fairly comprehensive article on screening for d epression in medical settings is http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1859039 -overview . This article reviews several scales. 6. Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -item Scale (GAD -&). This is a 7 -item scale to screen for generalized anxiety. One link is: http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical - practice/GAD708.19.08Cartwright.pdf . 7. Primary Care PTSD (PC -PTSD). This is a four item screening test for Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder. One link is: http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical -practice/PC -PTSD.pdf . 8. One excellent source for a number of screening tools for various mental health disorders is from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHS A), which is a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A link to a site that lists a number of tools is: http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical -practice/screening -tools . 9. CAGE Questionnaire for Drug Use a. Have you ever felt you ought to cut down on your drinking or drug use? b. Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking or drug use? c. Have you felt bad or guilty about your drinking or drug use? d. Have you ever had a drink or used drugs first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover (eye-opener)? Scoring: Item responses on the CAGE questions are scored 0 for \"no\" and 1 for \"yes\" answers, with a higher score being an indication of alcohol problems. A total score of two or greater is considered clinically significant. APPENDICES 15 MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT PROGRAM Methadone has been used in the treatment of opioid dependence for over 30 years. It has been found to be both effectiv e and safe in long term administration. Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) is the continual administering and dispensing of Methadone and other federally approved medications at relatively stable dosage levels, in conjunction with the provision of appropr iate social, clinical, and medical services for an individual who is dependent on an opiate or morphine -like substance. An adequate individualized daily dose of methadone eliminates drug craving, prevents the onset of withdrawal, and blocks (through opiate cross -tolerance) the effects typical of other opiates, such as heroin or morphine. Efficacy of treatment is based on elimination of or reduction in illicit/inappropriate drug use, elimination or marked reduction in illegal activities, improved employment, pro-social behavior and improved general health. Patients taking stable doses of methadone are able to drive and operate heavy machinery in the same manner as individuals not taking methadone. Also methadone can be utilized when patients are pregnant (it is also monitored as needed and/or during every trimester). MAT is designed for an unknown and possibly indefinite period, according to the need of the individual. The only appropriate measure of time in treatment is how long it takes the individual to overcome a life of addiction. All programmatic decisions regarding eligibility and admission criteria for MAT conform to regulations from the Dept. of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and Tn. State Methadone Authority. Clinics offering MAT are accredited through CARF (Commission for Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) or similar bodies. Most patients are self-referred and must agree to coordination of care with their primary care physician and/or mental health practitioner. Dual enrollment in pain management is inappropriate and not allowed. Patients are subject to random bottle checks. Initially, all patients are required to visit the clinic daily for dosing. As patients establish a reliable track record (counseling, licit drug screens, absence of behavioral problems/criminal activity, gainful vocational, educational, or employment activity, safeguarding of medication), they gradually earn \"take home\" medication for self-administration . The most trustworthy patients come to the clinic once every 28 days. Typical methadone doses range from 60-120 mg daily. Longstanding opiate abusers with high tolerance often do best staying on MAT with the supportive environment of the clinic staff. Younger patients or those with shorter abuse histories are more likely to be able to wean off methadone entirely. Public Chapter 912 will be enacted on January 1, 2017. The act creates nonresidential office -based opiate treatment facilities. This will require any facility defined as a Nonresidential office -based opiate treatment facility to attain licensure as such by the Department of Mental Health & Substance Abuse Services. Nonresidential office -based opiate treatment facilities refers to facilities that a re prescribing buprenorphine or products containing buprenorphine to 50% or more of its patients and to one hundred fifty patients or more. This legislation requires the TDMH&SAS to promulgate rules in consultation with the Department of Health. APPENDICES 16 WOMEN'S ISSUES: WOMEN OF CHILD BEARING AGE All women with reproductive capacity receiving a prescription for an opiate shall be educated about the risks of opiate use during pregnancy including the risk of physical dependence and addiction in the woman, the potential of physical dependence and withdrawal in the newborn, and possible long term consequences to the child. 1. Upon initiation of opioid therapy, the provider shall recommend reliable contraception such as long term reversible contraceptives and appropriate referrals should be made. 2. Any woman with reproductive capacity, who is presently under physician care for chronic pain management or medical replacement therapy, shall be counseled on the importance of reliable contraception such as long term reversible contraceptives. Appropriate referrals should be made. 3. The treatment plan shall include an expectation that a female patient will notify the provider if she becomes, or plans to become, pregnant. 4. The possibility of pregnancy should be assessed prior to initiation and continuation of any opioid or opioid replacement therapy. This risk should be assessed at each visit and prior to any refill for long-term therapies. A pregnancy test should be performed if there is any possibility of pregnancy. This should be documented in the medical record. 5. A woman who desires to become pregnant and is under physician treatment for chronic pain management and/or opioid replacement therapy shall be counseled on the potential risks of Intra -Uterine Drug Exposure. A referral for prenatal counseling should be made. Alternative treatment modalities should be discussed. Informed consent should be obtained prior to continuation of opioid or opioid replacement therapy. 6. Education shall include the potential risks of stopping her medicati ons on her own during her pregnancy which include: the risk of relapse, risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine withdrawal, fetal distress, and fetal demise. 7. A woman on opioid therapy who becomes pregnant or desires to become pregnant shall be referred to or consult with an Obstetrician and appropriate Pain Management Specialist or Medical Replacement Treatment program. APPENDICES 17 PREGNANT WOMEN 1. The OB and medical treatment physician should work together to encourage compliance with both chronic pain management or medical replacement therapy plan, and prenatal care. 2. A risk assessment, UDT, and CSMD check should be performed before initiating any opiate or benzodiazepine during pregnancy. 3. A UDT should be performed at intake to prenatal care. If positive, the mother should be referred to appropriate chronic pain management or replacement therapy specialists. The risks of Intra -Uterine Drug Exposure should be discussed, and documented, and random UDT should be performed during the prenatal course. 4. If a woman has a positiv e UDT on initial prenatal visit, A UDT should be performed upon admission for delivery to help identify the infant at risk for NAS. 5. Appropriate discontinuation has been shown to be safe for fetus during pregnancy. However, unintended consequences from tape ring may outweigh benefits. (Bell J, Towers CV, Hennessy MD, et al. Detoxification from opiate drugs during pregnancy. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2016) APPENDICES 18 RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS There are several validated risk assessment tools available to pain clinicians. Below i s some information on the most commonly used tools and links so that they can be obtained. Some tools are copyrighted and some are not, and practitioners should adhere to legal guidelines in making and obtaining copies for their use. 1. BRI (Brief Risk Inter view). This is a short (5 -10 minutes) clinical interview that is a validated risk assessment tool (Jones & Moore, 2013). Questions are asked about such topics as past misuse of opioid medications, presence of mental health disorders, personal history of Substance Use Disorder and family history of Substance Use Disorder . It also incorporates information from UDT's, past medical records and the CSMD. It classifies patients into risk categories of Low, Low Medium, Medium, Medium High, High and Very High. The scoring system and questions to be asked can be downloaded for free from www.tedjonesresearch.com . Interview information can also be scored on -line anonymously at that website. 2. DIRE (Diagnosis, Intractabilit y, Risk, Efficacy score). This is a staff/interviewer rating scale that uses information about the patient's diagnosis, engagement in treatment and psychiatric issues (Belgrade, Schamber and Lindgren, 2007). The numerical score categorizes patients into th e categories of \"not a suitable candidate for long -term opioid analgesia,\" and \"good candidate for long-term opioid analgesia.\" link to a pdf copy: http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/research/centers/CHWE/Docu ments/D.I.R.E.%20Score.pdf . 3. ORT (Opioid Risk Tool). This is a brief ten -item patient -completed written questionnaire (Webster & Webster, 2005). It may be the most widely used risk assessment tool in the field. It asks for information such as personal and family history of Substance Use Disorder and psychiatric issues. It classifies patients into Low, Medium and High risk categories. One link to a copy is: http://www.partnersagainstpain.com/printouts/Opioid_Risk_Tool.pdf . 4. PMQ (Pain Medication Questionnaire). This is a 26 -item patient -completed written risk questionnaire (Adams, Gatchel, Robinson, et. al., 2004). One study has shown that it is the best overall written risk assessment tool available.5 Questions include such topics as opinions about pain medication and pain treatment, obtaining pain medication, and past med ication -aberrant behavior. A few items are reverse scored, making it just slightly more difficult for staff to score. It classifies patients into Low, Medium and High categories of risk. Here is one link to a copy: http://www.opioidrisk.com/node/507 . 5. SOAPP (Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain). This is a 24 -item patient - completed written risk assessment questionnaire (Butler, Budman, Fernandez, et. al., 2004). One study has shown that th is questionnaire has the best sensitivity of any patient -completed questionnaire (best at identifying those patients which later engage in medication aberrant behavior).7 Items use a five -point rating scale and ask about such topics as impulsivity, cigaret te smoking, overtaking medication and past substance abuse. It classifies patients into Low and APPENDICES 19 High risk (no Medium category). One link to a copy is: http://www.painedu.org/soap.asp . Please check with the au thors about fees at http:// www.painedu.org/soapp.asp . 6. SOAPP -R (Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain - Revised). This 24 -item patient -completed questionnaire is a revision of the SOA PP (Butler, Fernandez, Benoit, et. al., 2008). The SOAPP -R is a widely used risk assessment tool. It uses a five -point rating scale in asking questions about such topics as impulsivity, legal problems, past Substance Use Disorder and past sexual abuse. I t classifies patients in risk categories of Low and High risk (while it refers to a Medium category in the SOAPP -R manual, there has been no validation on the use of the Medium category). One link to a copy is: http://www.opioidrisk.com/node/610 . Please check with the authors about use and fees at http:// www.painedu.org/soapp.asp . 7. BRQ (Brief Risk Questionnaire). patient -completed questionn aire (Jones, Lookatch and Moore, 2015)8. It asks patients about a wider range of variables than other risk assessment tools, asking about such issues as history of theft of medication, current help with medication storage, past incarceration and literacy. Patients are categorized into Low, Medium or High risk categories. It appears to be a more sensitive screening tool in identif ying risk but may also tend to overrate a patient's risk. It can be obtained on a free download from www.tedjonesresearch.com . APPENDICES 20 CSMD: CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE MONITORING DATABASE Background The Tennessee ( T N ) Controlled Substance Monitoring Database (CSMD) is a prescription monitoring program designed to provide healthcare practiti oners with a comprehensive view of a patient 's controlled substance prescription history. The purpose of the CSMD is to increase the quality of patient care by equipping healthcare practitioners with accurate, timely information that the practitioners can use to determine when patients acquiring controlled substances may require counseling or intervention for substance abuse, by collecting and maintaining data regarding all controlled substances in Schedules II, III, and IV dispensed in this state, and Sche dule V controlled substances identified by the controlled substance database committee as demonstrating a potential for abuse. Further, the database is to be used to assist in research, statistical analysis, criminal investigations, enforcement of standard s of health professional practice, and state or federal laws involving controlled substances. Access to Information Information sent to, contained in, and reported from the database in any format is confidential, not public record and not subject to subpoe na. Access is made available to the CSMD only as provided for in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 53-10-308 and to the following persons: Personnel of the committee specifically assigned to conduct analysis or research; Authorized committee, board, or departmen t personnel or any designee appointed by the committee engaged in analysis of controlled substances prescription information as a part of their assigned duties and responsibilities; A healthcare practitioner conducting medication history reviews who is in volved in the care of a patient or making decisions regarding patient care or patient enrollment; a healthcare practitioner or supervising physician of a healthcare practitioner conducting a review of all medications dispensed by prescription attributed to that healthcare practitioner or a healthcare practitioner having authority to prescribe or dispense controlled substances, to the extent the information relates specifically to a current or bona fide prospective patient of the healthcare practitioner, to whom the healthcare practitioner has prescribed or dispensed, is prescribing, dispensing, approving of the prescribing or dispensing, or considering prescribing or dispensing any controlled substance.

CSMD DATA The CSMD contains prescription information from all dispensers of controlled substances in TN and also those dispe nsers who ship to a patient residing in TN. This includes mail-order pharmacies and some Veteran 's Affairs pharmacies as well. The CSMD collects and maintains dispensing data regarding all controlled substances in Schedules II, III, IV, and V controlled substances ( I n J u l y 2 0 1 8 t h e CSMD Committee decided that Schedule V prescription drugs are to be reported due to concerns of potential abuse). Data is to be submitted at least once every business day for all the controlled substances dispensed, but no later than the close of business on the following business day. TN Together legislation changed the prescription reporting requirements to the TN data collection which populates the CSMD. Dispensers of controlled substance prescriptions were to ensure that their pharmacy dispensing system was compliant with the ASAP 4.2A (June 2017 version) by January APPENDICES 22 1, 2019. Some of the changes are highlighted below: Medical Necessity ICD-10 code Partial Fills All data in the CSMD is reported as submitted to the data collection website by the dispenser. Therefore, if there are any questions about the data a practitioner should contact the dispenser identified within the report. The dispenser can, in turn, correct any errant information by coordinating with the TN's data collection vendor. Neither the data collection vendor nor the T N Department of Health can edit prescription information found in the CSMD. For additional reporting information please consult the TN Data Collection Manual. Registration All prescribers and dispensers of controlled substances in TN must register for access to the CSMD. Healthcare practitioners wishing to register with the CSMD to access prescription information are required to navigate to www.TNCSMD.com and choose the \"register\" link. A registration form will appear requesting information used to validate a healthcare provider 's statutory authority to access CSMD data. A username and instructions to set up a password will be sent to the approved registran t after validation and processing. A healthcare provider may also choose to allow an unlimited number of licensed and up to two unlicensed delegates to register with the CSMD in order to retrieve prescription information on the prescriber or dispenser 's behalf. The delegate should navigate to www.TNCSMD.com and register for a separate account. In addition to supplying self-identifying information, the delegate must provide information which identifies the supervisor permitting access to the CSMD. A user name and instructions to set up password will be sent to the delegate after validation and processing. The delegate will get an email with a username and instructions to set up a password that will allow th e delegate to log into the CSMD but delegate will not be able to run a patient report until the supervisor logs into to the CSMD and approves the relationship with the delegate. Once the approval process is complete, the delegate may access CSMD informatio n on behalf of the healthcare provider. All access by any user leaves an audit trail that can be monitored and accessed as needed. A supervisor and or delegate may revoke the relationship in the CSMD at any time. Law enforcement personnel engaged in an official investigation or enforcement of state or federal laws involving controlled substances wishing to request information must follow a distinct process outlined in T.C.A. \u00a7 53-10-306 (a)(6) in order to request information from CSMD administration. CSMD Reports Patient Report A patient 's CSMD report contains a variety of information related to the prescriber and dispenser of controlled substances. After entering the search criteria, a pick list of potential matches appears to consider incorporating for creation of the patient report. Please note that many patients may have a similar name or date of birth as another patient in the CSMD and it is possible for erroneous information to be incorporated into the patient report if inappropriate patients are selected during this process. Once the patient report is generated, a CSMD user will see a list of all patient IDs incorporated into APPENDICES 23 the report along with address information. The user will also see a list of all prescriptions attributed to the selected patient IDs in reverse chronologic order. On the right side of the first page is an estimated morphine equivalent dose that the patient is currently taking. At the end of the p at ien t report there is a listing of all prescribers and dispensers associated with the patient 's selected prescription history, as well as additional information used to calculate the morphine equivalent dose. Prescriber Self -Lookup A prescriber can utilize the prescriber self-lookup report for multiple purposes. The report is useful for identifying potential prescription fraud, i.e. a stolen prescription pad or phoned -in prescriptions. It is also a useful snapshot of a prescriber 's patient population and the prescriptions attributed to the prescriber. All data in the CSMD is reported as submitted to the data collection vendor by the dispenser. Therefore, if there are any questions about the data a prescriber should contact the dispenser identified within the report. The dispenser can, in turn, correct any errant information by coordinating with the state's data collection vendor. Neither the data collection vendor nor the T N Department of Health can edit prescription information found in the CSMD. Future Enhancements The CSMD Committee and TN Department of Health are committed to utilizing the CSMD to protect patient health and prevent prescription drug abuse and diversion. As resources become available, enhancements will be incorporated into the CSMD to further this mission. Enhancements such as enhanced prescriber reports and integration of the CSMD into clinical workflows are being investigated as well as to continue to share data with additional states or jurisdictions as laws allow. Any suggested improvements can be sent to csmd.admin@tn.gov for consideration. Operational and Legal Resources The statute governing the operation of the CSMD is found under T.C.A. \u00a7 53-10 Part 3 and the supporting rules are 1140-11. Current Federal Regulations (42 CFR Part II) protect the confidentiality of patien ts in a federally recognized Substance Use Disorder treatment facility and thus their dispensed medications are not included in the CSMD. The statute making doctor shopping illegal is found under T.C.A. \u00a7 53-11-402 and \u00a7 71-5-2601. The statute requiring reporting of a doctor shopper to law enforcement can be found at T.C.A. \u00a7 53-11-309. A form to report a potential doctor shopper to law enforcement is available at: https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/healthprofboards/csmd/PH -4152.pdf , and p lease send the form to the Tennessee Dangerous Drug Task Force at 423 -267-8983. Additional information about the CSMD as well as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and the Data Collection Manual can be obtained by navigating to the state CSMD CONSENT: Controlled Substance Agreement Please read the information below carefully and ask your provider if you have any questions relating to the medication prescribed to you. Using Controlled Medications t o Treat Pain a. These medications are used to treat moderate -to-severe pain of any type, and to treat anxiety and stress associated with moderate -to-severe pain. b. These medications are best understood as potentially effective tools that can help reduce pain, improve function, and improve quality of life c. Using these medications requires that both the physician and patient work together in a responsible way to ensure the best outcome, lowest side effects, and least complications How Do Opioids work? a. Opio id medications work at the injury site, the spinal cord, and the brain b. They dampe n pain, but do not treat the underlyin g injury c. They may help to preve nt acute pain from becoming persis tent chron ic pain d. Thes e medications may work differentl y on differen t peop le because of a numbe r of factors. e. Side effect s and complication s will also individuall y vary How do Benzodiazepines work? a. The benzodiazepines are a class of drugs with varying properties, which act by slowing down the central nervous system. b. Benzodiazepines are useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, agitation, seizures, and muscle spasms. While Benzodiazepines do not treat acute or chronic pain, they are taken by patients with pain for other issues (such as anxiety or muscle spasms). c. These medications may work differently on different people because of a number of factors. d. Side effects and complications will also individually vary What to Expect When You Take Controlled Medications for Pain and Related Conditions a. Pain relief b. Reduction of anxiety and stress caused by pain c. Side effects What Should Not Be Expected From Treatment with Controlled Medications a. Cure of the underlying injury b. Total elimination of pain, anxiety, and stress c. Loss of ability to feel other physical pain Negative Effects of Controlled Medications Vary in Different People 1. Opioid Side effects : a. Common effects include: Constipation, dry mouth, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, euphoria, forgetfulness, difficulty urinating, and itching b. Uncommon effects include: Confusion, hallucinations, shortness of bre ath, depression, lack of motivation 2. Benzodiazepines Side effects : a. The most common side effects include: Clumsiness or unsteadiness, dizziness or lightheadedness and drowsiness; slurred b. Less common side effects include: Anxiety; confusion ( may be more common in the elderly); fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat; mental depression; abdominal or stomach cramps or pain; blurred vision or other changes in vision; changes in sexual desire or APPENDICES 25 ability; constipation; diarrhea; dryness of mouth or increased thirst; false sense of well - being; headache; increased bronchial secretions or watering of mouth; muscle nausea or vomiting; problems with urination; trembling or shaking; unusual tiredness or weakness 3. Physical dependency : a. Opioid medicatio ns will cause a physical dependency marked by abstinence syndrome when they are stopped abruptly. If these medications are stopped or rapidly decreased the patient will experience chills, goose bumps, profuse sweating, increased pain, irritability, anxiety , agitation, and diarrhea. The medicines will not cause these symptoms if taken as prescribed and any decision to stop these medications should be done under the supervision of your physician in a slow downward taper. b. Benzodiazepines may be habit -forming ( causing mental or physical dependence), especially when taken for a long time or in high doses. Some signs of dependence on benzodiazepines are: A strong desire or need to continue taking the medicine; a need to increase the dose to receive the effects of the medicine. Withdrawal effects occurring; for example, irritability, nervousness, trouble in sleeping, abdominal or stomach cramps, trembling or shaking. 4. Misuse of medications: Addiction This is a psychological condition of use of a substance despite sel f- harm. Between six and ten percent of the population of the United States have problems with Substance Use Disorder and addiction. Controlled medications are likely to activate addictive behavior in this group of people 5. Diversion: It is illegal to share your controlled medications with other people. It is illegal to provide false information to a prescriber in an attempt to obtain controlled medication. It is illegal to doctor shop, or visit multiple doctors in attempt to obtain controlled medications. Federal and state laws exist to address diversion problems. It is critical that you safeguard your controlled medications and use them only as prescribed by your doctor. 6. Driving : Studies of patients with chronic pain demonstrate improved driving skills when taking certain controlled medications, but individuals may have problems driving and need to realistically assess their own skills, as well as listen to others who drive with them to determine if they should be driving while taking these medications. You should consult the State Department of Transportation if you have questions about driving and taking controlled medications. This is especially important if your work involves driving, making important decisions that affect others, etc. Common Sense Rules for Using Controlled Medications a. Follow your doctor's recommendations . b. Do not take more or less pills than prescribed without discussing this first with your physician and receiving permission to do so. c. Do not share medications with family or friends . d. Do not take medications from family or friends . e. Do not stop these medications abruptly. Dose reductions need to be discussed and cleared by your physician. This is important no matter which controlled medication you take. f. Do not sell medications . APPENDICES 26 g. Do not take medications in any manner other than prescribed. For example do not chew or inject your medications . h. Keep all medications out of reach of children . i. Do not leave your prescriptions or controlled medications lying around unprotected for others to steal and abuse them . j. Do not operate a motor vehicle if you feel mentally impaired using controlled medications. You are responsible for exhibiting good judgment in your daily affairs, including your use of controlled medications. k. Alcohol use should be curtailed when using controlled medications . Continued Use of Controlled Medication is based on your physician 's judgment and a determination of whether the benefits to you of using controlled medications outweigh the risks of using them. Your physician may discontinue treating you at his or her discretion. Your physician may require a consultation with an addiction specialist. Your physician may require more frequent visits. We believe in treating your pain and we recognize the value of controlled medications in this process. When used properly, controlled medications can help restore comfort, function, and quality of life. However, as stated above, controlled medications may also have serious side effects and are highly controlled because of their potential for misuse and abuse. It is important to work with your physician and communicate openly and honestly with him or her about your pain control needs. By doing so, medications can be used safely and successfully. By your signature below, you are acknowledging that you have read and reviewed these matters with your physician and that you have sufficient information to make a decision to use the controlled medications prescribed. You should NOT sign this form if you do not believe you have enough information to make an infor med decision about your use of controlled medications and how they fit in to your pain management treatment plan. Patient Name: _________________ Physician Substance Treatment PATIENT NAME: PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN/SITE: I understand that this agreement between myself; and (insert name of medical office/group) is intended to clarify the manner in which chronic (long - term) controlled substances will be used to manage my chronic pain. Chronic controlled substance thera py for patients who do not suffer from cancer pain is a controversial issue. I understand that there are side effects to this therapy; these include, but are not limited to, allergic reactions, depression, sedation, decreased mental ability, itching, difficulty in urinating, nausea and vomiting, loss of energy, decreased balance and falling, constipation, decreased sexual desire and function, potential for overdose and death. Care should be take when operating machinery or driving a car while taking these medications. When controlled substances are used long-term, some particular concerns include the development of physical dependence and addiction. I understand these risks and have had my questions answered by my physician. I understand that my (insert name of medical group) physician will prescribe controlled substances only if the following rules are adhered to: All controlled substance prescriptions must be obtained from your (insert name of medical group) primary care physician. If a new cond ition develops, such as trauma or surgery, then the physician caring for that problem may prescribe narcotics for the increase in pain that may be expected. I will notify my primary care physician within 48-hours of my receiving a narcotic or any other controlled substance from any other physician or other licensed medical provider. For females only: If I become pregnant while taking this medicine, I will immediately inform my obstetrician and obtain counseling on risks to the baby. I will submit urine and/ or blood on request for testing at any time without prior notification to detect the use of non-prescribed drugs and medications and confirm the use of prescribed ones. I will submit to pill counts without notice as per physician's request. I will pay any portion of the costs associated with urine and blood testing that is not covered by my insurance. All requests for refills must be made by contacting my (insert name of medical group) primary care physician during business hours at least 3-workdays in advance of the anticipated need for the refill. All prescriptions must be filled at the same pharmacy, which is authorized to release a record of my medications to this office upon request. A copy of this agreement will be sent to my pharmacy. Pharmacy name/ad dress/telephone: APPENDICES 28 The daily dose may not be changed without my (insert name of medical group) primary care physician's consent. This includes either increasing or decreasing the daily dose. Prescription refills will not be given prior to the planned refill date determined by the dose and quantity prescribed. I will accept generic medications. Accidental destruction, loss of medications or prescriptions will not be a reason to refill medications or rewrite prescriptions early. I will safeguard my controlled substance medications from use by family members, children or other unauthorized persons. You may be referred to an appropriate specialist to evaluate your physical condition. You may be asked to have an evaluation by either a psychiatrist or psychologist to help manage your medication needs. If your physician determines that you are not a good candidate to continue with the medication, you may be referred to a detoxification program or evaluation by a pain management center. These medication s may be discontinued or adjusted at your physician's discretion. I understand that it is my physician's policy that all appointments must be kept or cancelled at least 2-working days in advance. I understand that the original bottle of each prescribed controlled substance medication must be brought to every visit. I understand that I am responsible for meeting the terms of this agreement and that failure to do so will/may result in my discharge as a patient of (insert name of medical group) . Grounds for dismissal from (insert name of medical group) include, but are not limited to: Evidence of recreational drug use, of drug diversion, of altering scripts (this may result in criminal prosecution), of obtaining controlled substance prescriptions from other doctors without notifying this office, abusive language toward staff, development of progressive tolerance, use of alcohol or intoxicants, engagement in criminal activities, etc. Patient 's Signature Witness ' Signature Date Date APPENDICES 29 URINE DRUG TEST ING Drug testing of patients receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT) is recommended by numerous entities, including the American Pain Society (APS), the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM), American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP), th e Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).1-18 The purpose of drug testing is to identify the presence of expected and unexpected prescribed medications and identify the use of illicit substances to enhance patient safety and promote public health and welfare. Therefore, testing should target common drugs of abuse, both prescription and illicit. Unexpected urine drug test (UDT) results are seen frequently, with one study showing 27% of patients with no behavioral signs pre senting with unexpected positive UDT results.6 A study in a pain management program at an urban teaching hospital reported a 45% rate of unexpected toxicology results. The prevalence of illicit drugs in UDT results of pain management patients has been repo rted between 10.9 and 24%.5,19,20 Given these circumstances, a consistent approach to UDT based on validated risk models and clinical evaluation is advised ( See Risk Assessment Tools Appendix) . Historically, most urine drug testing performed for complianc e assessment purposes incorporated two steps: screening and conrmation. This screen and confirm testing paradigm was developed for the workplace setting due to its ease of use and lower costs. However, this approach presents many pitfalls for use in the c linical setting. Immunoassay (IA) is the most common method used for screening, and is frequently employed by on - site, point - of-care testing (POCT) in outpatient clinics and hospital laboratories. The most frequently used definitive or confirmatory metho ds include gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Depending on how LC/MS/MS is performed, it may also be used as a screening method.21 IA tests are qualitative in nature and detect the pr esence or absence of a drug class and provide the advantage rapid results. However, IA tests have significant cross -reactivity with other substances, resulting in lower sensitivity and specificity when compared to confirmation testing. Studies of presumpti ve positive IA tests show high rates of false -positive results when sent for confirmatory testing Table 1 Table 1. Reported rates of presumptive positive results which did not confirm (false positives)22-23 Immunoassay Manchikanti, et al (2011) Kirsh, tested 76.2% Table 2. P artial list of drugs which can cause a false -positive IA result. Table 2: Cross -Reacting Compounds on Immunoassay (IA)21 IA Test Potential Drugs Causing a False either metabolize to morphine, and are therefore a \"true\" positive result A true negative test result means that at the time of collection, the concentration of drug/metabolite fell below the test cutoff, or threshold. Due to different rates of metabolism and excretion and interpatient variability in a drug's period of detection, a tru e negative result may occur because the specimen was collected beyond the expected window of detection. A false negative result occurs when a drug/metabolite was present in the specimen, but was not detected by the testing method used. Reasons identified a s possible causes of false negative immunoassay results include the following: Lack of cross -reactivity -Opiate immunoassays are targeted for natural opioids such as codeine and morphine and may not reliably detect synthetic or semi -synthetic opioids, such as hydrocodone, oxycodone or oxymorphone. Rates of false negatives have ranged from 30 - 72%.23-24 Drugs not included in testing -Commonly abused prescription drugs may not be included in the immunoassay including drugs such as: carisoprodol, methadone, immunoassay -Most immunoassays only detect parent drug. For instance, most immunoassays are cross -reactive to opioid normetabolites at a rate of 0.1%. However, many patients excrete only opioid normetabolit es, ranging from 2.2 -53.1%, depending on drug.25-26 Thresholds are too high -Most immunoassay screens were developed for workplace drug testing where thresholds are typically higher than in clinical settings. False negatives for illicit drugs are common wi th immunoassay screening when higher thresholds are used. Dilute specimen -The most common attempt to beat a drug test is to ingest excess water, which can be effective in producing a false negative result. Specimen validity testing, performed as part of co nfirmatory testing, is effective in identifying dilution attempts. Adulterated or substituted specimens -Adulterants may be added to a specimen to mask the presence of illicit drugs. Specimen validity testing, performed as part of confirmatory testing, is effective in identifying adulteration attempts. APPENDICES 31 Due to high rates of false positive and negative results, consideration should be given to performing confirmatory testing when making treatment decisions. Oral fluid confirmation testing is a widely acceptab le and growing alternative to UDT in pain management patients, especially in cases of shy bladder, severe renal impairment or suspected urine specimen tampering/substitution. Oral fluid testing is increasingly used due to ease of collection, limited invasi veness and opportunity for direct observation. Most prescription drugs of interest in pain management and illicit drugs are readily detectable in oral fluid when proper collection procedures are followed.27-28 One notable difference between oral fluid and urine is that the disposition of parent drug and metabolites is reversed. While metabolite concentrations typically exceed parent drug in urine, parent drugs are generally more readily detectable than metabolites in oral fluid. This may be relevant for patients with impaired or absent metabolism due to pharmacogenetics or drug -drug interactions, especially for drugs that are extensively metabolized and only detected by metabolite presence in urine. The increased detection of parent drugs in oral fluid may b e useful to assess compliance in these circumstances, particularly when urine specimen adulteration or tampering is suspected.21,29 Frequency of drug testing is left to the prescriber's discretion, but general guidelines can be discussed, based on the rela tive risk for addiction or death of the patient. As detailed elsewhere in these guidelines confirmation testing is required prior to the outset of COT and at least twice per year for all patients on COT. Lower risk patients would typically be maintained on this frequency. Moderate risk patients would be tested 3 -4 times per year. Higher risk patients and those over 100mg MEDD should be tested 4 -5 times per year. Instances of aberrant behavior such as lost or stolen medication may also prompt additional scre ening. Higher risk patients may also need routine confirmation testing because certain aberrant behaviors will appear normal with office -based (POCT). Unexpected results from POCT should be sent for confirmatory testing. It is important to note that a pati ent's level of risk may change over time30 and therefore risk should be reassessed periodically to determine if more or less frequent testing is warranted. When conducting testing, a prescriber should inform the patient of the reason for testing and the po tential consequences of the results. Ideally, testing should be performed at random intervals when possible to maximize effect on compliance. Interpretation of UDT results can be difficult, as opioids undergo extensive metabolism after ingestion; the metab olism is affected by pharmacogenetics, drug -drug and drug -food interactions.31-32 Many prescription opioids are metabolized to other commercially available opioids, which can complicate interpretation. (A metabolism chart for codeine, hydrocodone and oxyco done is included at the end of this appendix -Figure 1). Pharmaceutical impurities can be another source of unexpected results, which have been described as occurring in up to 1% of the label medication quantities. The following impurities have been describ ed in literature:33-36 Hydrocodone Codeine in morphine. In some instances, metabolites may be present in the absence of parent drug. Normetabolites are products of CYP3A 4 metabolism, which is subject to induction and inhibition by drug -drug and drug - food interactions. Morphine, hydromorphone and oxymorphone are pharmacologically active metabolites which are products of CYP2D6 metabolism, which is subject to drug inhibitio n and pharmacogenetic variability. Additionally, minor metabolism can produce other metabolites. For example, small amounts of hydromorphone are possible after morphine use and small amounts of hydrocodone are possible after codeine use. The enzymes respo nsible for this metabolism have not been identified and metabolism may not take place in all patients.21 In confirmation testing, unexpected sources of a detected metabolite should be considered; a table of potential causes of unexpected positive results i s included in Table 3. Table 3: Possible sources of unexpected positive opioid markers Drug Identified Comments on Alternative Sources Codeine Pharmaceutical impurity in morphine (up to 0.5%).33 Pharmaceutical impurity in hydrocodone (up to 0.15%).33 Codeine may be present after use of heroin.37 Codeine is a component in several prescription and OTC cough suppressants. Codeine may be present after ingestion of poppy seeds, typically at lower concentrations than morphine.12 Products containing opium may re sult in positive findings primarily for morphine, with codeine at lesser concentrations. Dihydrocodeine Dihydrocodeine is a component in several prescription cough suppressants. Heroin Heroin -specific markers include parent heroin, 6-acetylmorphine (6AM) , and 6- acetylcodeine. Other metabolites which include codeine, sometimes hydromorphone. Hydrocodone Minor metabolite of codeine: hydrocodone concentrations in concentration.38 (most notably OxyContin\u00ae, up to 1%).33 Hydrocodone is a component of several prescription cough suppressants (e.g., Tussionex\u00ae, Hycodan\u00ae). Hydromorphone Minor metabolite of morphine: hydromorphone concentrations usually under 6% of the morphine concentration.39-43 Hydromorphone sometimes appears as a metabolite of morphine after heroin ingestion. Pharmaceutical impurity in oxymorphone (up to 0.15%).33 APPENDICES 33 Table 3: Possible sources of unexpected positive opioid markers Drug Identified Comments on Alternative Sources Morphin e Poppy seeds in food products (bagels, salad dressings, etc) may result in morphine concentrations in urine up to 2,000 ng/mL.12 In rare instances, poppy seeds have resulted in higher morphine concentrations, but these occurrences are considered exception s.44-49 Codeine concentrations are typically less than half the morphine concentration (or lower) after poppy seed ingestion.49-50 Poppy seeds are unlikely to cause a positive morphine result in oral fluid or blood.12,50 -51 Pharmaceutical impurity in h ydromorphone (up to 0.15%).33 Products containing opium may result in positive findings primarily for morphine, with codeine at lesser concentrations. Oxycodone Pharmaceutical impurity in oxymorphone (up to 0.5%)33 Due to interpatient variability, a bro ad range of observed patterns of parent drug and metabolites is possible. If a provider has questions about interpretation of toxicology results, they should contact the laboratory director, toxicologist, or local Medical Review Officer. APPENDICES 34 TAPERING PROTO COL There are many reasons to discontinue chronic opiate therapy. Any time the risks of the continued opiate use outweigh its potential benefit, the therapy should be discontinued. Violation of the controlled substances could be another reason to discontin ue opiates. 1. Opiate discontinuation does pose the potential for withdrawal syndrome. This typically consists of nausea, vomiting, myalgia, headaches, abdominal pain, and sweating. These symptoms are not usually serious, and while not fatal, opiate withdraw al can cause discomfort. It should be noted, however, that benzodiazepine withdrawal does have the potential to be life threatening. 2. Low dose opiates may not require weaning at all. If the decision is made to discontinue opiates, steps should be taken to minimize the impact of opiate withdrawal syndrome. It is the responsibility of the current prescribing provider to address this issue. 3. There are several different weaning protocols outlined by various sources. A conservative approach recommends a 10% reduct ion in the original dose per week. Other sources state that a 25% reduction every 4 days should avoid withdrawal syndrome. The more rapid protocols recommend for a daily reduction of 25-50% of the previous days dose. The Tennessee Department of Health does not recommend any one specific weaning protocol. 4. There are also several different medications that can help alleviate the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Clonidine can diminish some of the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Clonidine can be administered 0.1- 0.2mg orally every 6 hours or with a transdermal patch at 0.1mg/24hours. Hypotension and anticholinergic side effects may be encountered with clonidine. Weaning opiates is not always indicated when they are to be discontinued. If recent urine drug screening has shown that opiates are not present in the patient 's system, then a weaning protocol would not be necessary. 5. If drug diversion were suspected then prescribing additional opiates would not be indicated. In any circumstance where prescribing additional opiates to a patient is thought to constitute more risk to the patient or to the community than the potential for withdrawal syndrome, no additional opiates should be prescribed. APPENDICES 35 MORPHINE EQUIVALENT DOSE Morphine equivalent dose (MED) is the equipotent dose of any opioid in terms of morphine. Morphine is widely regarded as the \"standard\" for the treatment of moderate to severe pain and is used as the reference point. As MED increases, the likelihood of an adverse effect increases, therefore identifying at-risk patients is a crucial first step towards improving patient safety. Various MED charts are available for use in clinical practice, for instance, the Tennessee Controlled Substance Monitoring Database (CSMD) utilizes a chart of conversion factors create d by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The conversion factor is entered into the following formula: MED Conversion Formula: (Drug Strength) * (Drug Quantity) * (Morphine Equivalent Multiplier) MED= ______________________________________ _________________________ (Day Supply) CDC guidance states that fentanyl and buprenorphine patches are exceptions to using the above formula to compute MEDs. This exception only applies to the transdermal patch formulation, not the other dosage forms of either drug. A calculation of MED for these transdermal patch formulations must incorporate the frequency of patch rotation, which may vary depending upon the prescriber 's directions. Therefore, even though the duration of use of each patch may be less than the typical number of days, the quantity of drug that a patient receives each day remains constant because of the continuous release rate of active ingredient from the patch. Due to its complex pharmacokinetic properties, methadone exhibits an exponential increase in MED as dose increases above approximately 30 to 40 milligrams of methadone per day. Particular caution is warranted when methadone therapy approaches or exceeds these daily doses, or when a concomitant medication may inhibit methadone metaboli sm through the cytochrome CYP450 system. No MED chart can adequately account for the patient -specific responses to a particular agent as risk of adverse events from taking any opioid can be dose-independent and may begin at low doses. Some of the variables include: age, gender, genetic variability in drug metabolism, drug-drug interactions, opioid tolerance and organ dysfunction such as renal and hepatic impairment, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and abnormal levels of protein binding. Therefore, any conversion chart should only be used as a guide when formulating treatment plan. Dosing should be individualized and begun at conservative doses, based on assessment of risk. APPENDICES 36 CO-PRESCRIBING NALOXONE I. Introduction and Epidemiology 1. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2017 there were 70,237 deaths due to drug overdose nationwide, with 47,600 of those deaths being the result of an overdose involving any opioid, and 17,029 of those deaths involving a prescription opioid. Tennessee had 1818 overdose deaths in 2018. 2. Naloxone is a medication approved by the FDA for the use in reversing the effects of an overdose involving opioids, classified as a pure opioid antagonist, and works by blocking opioid receptor sites to reverse an opioid overdose, and is available in multiple dosages and routes of administration, which include intramuscular, intravenous, and intranasal formulations. II. Risk Factors for outpatient setting only Patients may be at risk of an overdose for reasons rela ted to opioid dose or pre -existing condition that could negatively interact with the opioid. These patients include those who: 1. Are taking an opioid greater than 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day (MME/day) 2. Are taking benzodiazepines 3. Reportedly use or have used heroin, illicit synthetic opioids, or misuse prescription opioids or otherwise have an Opioid Use Disorder 4. Have any other mental illness unrelated to substance use 5. Reportedly have non -opioid substance use disorder or report excessive alcohol use 6. Have prior history of overdose 7. Have respiratory conditions such as COPD or sleep apnea 8. Patients taking an opioid who have children or other dependents in the home who could have access to the medication 9. Patients with an opioid prescription who have d ifficulty accessing emergency medical care 10. A family member, friend, or other person in a position to assist a person at risk of experiencing an opiate -related overdose III. Co-prescribing Naloxone 1. The Tennessee Chronic Pain Guidelines Committee recommend that clinician(s) should incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone when factors that increase the risk for opioid overdose, such as history of overdose, history of substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (greater than or equal to 50MME/day), or concurrent benzodiazepine use, are present. The best way to ensure that a patient has access to naloxone is to simultaneously prescribe naloxone to the patient at the same time a prescription for an opioid is writt en. While there are other introduction points for naloxone before an overdose, this can ensure that an at -risk patient has access to naloxone before a prescription opioid overdose has the opportunity to transpire (See II). APPENDICES 37 2. The prescriber should provide a prescription for naloxone hydrochloride or another drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the complete or partial reversal of an opioid overdose event to a patient at risk as defined above in II. Exclusions for palliative and h ospice care may be considered. IV. Options for Providing/Receiving Naloxone 1. According to Tennessee Code 63 -1-101, a licensed healthcare practitioner may write a prescription for naloxone for a patient, when acting in good faith and exercising reasonable care, both with an opioid prescription or any time following the prescription of an opioid. 2. Patient may receive naloxone from a dispensing licensed pharmacist educated on the proper use of naloxone who is dispensing under the supervision of a prescriber(s) by way of collaborative pharmacy practice agreement pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 63 -10-217. In 2016, Public Chapter 596 authorized pharmacists across the state to enter into a collaborative pharmacy practice agreement with the Chief Medical Officer for the Tennessee Department of Health which allows a trained pharmacist to initiate a prescription for naloxone for those that are at risk for an opioid overdose or may be in a position to assist someone who is at risk for experiencing an opioid overdose. 3. Patient may receive naloxone through a pharmacy that has an active standing order. 4. Drug Coalitions may also have Naloxone provided by grant. V. Statewide Collaborative Pharmacy Practice Agreement Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 63 -10-217 states the requirements for a collaborative practice agreement to exist between a pharmacist and a prescriber. 1. Collaborative Pharmacy Practice Agreement (CPPA) shall be between one or more licensed pharmacists and an individual licensed prescriber or more than one licensed presc riber in an organized medical group. 2. CPPA must explain the parameters set around the patient care services provided by the pharmacists, which must also fall within the authorized prescriber's scope of practice. 3. Patient care provided by the pharmacist must be documented and readily accessible to the authorized prescriber or must be communicated to the authorized prescriber within 3 business days. 4. A copy of the CPPA must be accessible at each practice site engaged in CPPA. 5. CPPA must be reviewed and renewed at least biennially. Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 63 -1-157 authorizes the chief medical officer for the department of health to implement a statewide collaborative pharmacy practice agreement specific to opioid antagonist therapy with any pharmacist licens ed and practicing in the state of Tennessee. 1. Under this CPPA, a pharmacist may dispense naloxone to any individual at risk of an overdose or any individual at risk of witnessing an overdose in which they are in a position to assist the person at risk of an overdose. 2. Pharmacists must be trained in naloxone administration within the past two (2) years. 3. CPPA must adhere to the requirements set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 63 -10-217. APPENDICES 38 VI. Healthcare Provider Education As stated previously, per Tennessee Cod e Annotated \u00a7 63 -1-152, evidence of the use of reasonable care shall include the receipt of training regarding how to administer naloxone, which can be achieved through the completion of the online overdose prevention education program offered by the Depar tment of Health as evidenced by a certificate of completion. 1. More information on Naloxone Training for healthcare professionals, please According to Board of Pharmacy rule 1140 -03-.01 - Responsibilities for Pharmaceutical Care, \"Upon the receipt of a medical or prescription order and following a review of the patient's record, a pharmacist shall personally counsel the patient or caregiver \"face -to-face\" if the patient or caregiver is present.\" A licensed, au thorized pharmacist must educate and train the patient or caregiver on the proper use of naloxone upon the dispensing of the medication. 1. Training on the administration of naloxone for the general public can also be found SAFETY NET Tennessee 's Substance Use Disorder Treatment System 1. Substance Use Disorders are a pervasive public health issue that has roots in individual, family, peer, and community conditions. Substance Use Disorders negatively impact families and children, increases crime, threatens public safety, and imposes tremendous social and economic costs to every community. Not surprisingly, it also prompts a wide range of responses across the public and private institutional systems. 2. The National Survey of Substance Use Disorder Treatment Services (N-SSATS) examines facilities providing substance abuse treatment services conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). N-SSATS collects data on the location, characteristics , services, and number of clients in treatment at alcohol and drug abuse treatment facilities (both public and private) throughout the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other U.S. jurisdictions. It looks at 208 facilities in Tennessee: 3. The Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, Division of Substance Abuse Services (TDMHSAS -DSAS), serves as the single state authority for receiving and administering federal block grant funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/SAMHSA and state funding to serve indigent uninsured individuals around the state who have a substance use disorder. The mission of TDMHSAS -DSAS is to improve the quality of life of Tennesseans by providing an integrated network of comprehensive treatment services for Substance Use Disorder , fostering self-sufficiency and protecting those who are at risk of substance misuse, dependence and addiction. 4.

TDMHSAS licenses organizations to provide a continuum of treatment services for substance use disorders throughout the state. Services include outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial hos pitalization, residential treatment, clinical halfway house, social detoxification, medically monitored detoxification, medically managed detoxification, and opioid treatment. Many of these agencies accept commercial insurance, TennCare, and self- pay. N-SSATS found that 81.7% of Tennessee's Substance Use Disorder treatment providers offer outpatient treatment services, 32.7% offer residential services, and 6.7% offer hospital inpatient services. 6. The Tennessee Redline is a 24/7 addiction treatment and recove ry hotline that connects Tennessee residents with state funded, addiction treatment and recovery services.

APPENDICES 41 PRESCRIPTION DRUG DISPOSAL Proper Disposal Unwanted, unused or expired prescription drugs present substantial risks to communities through the potential for abusive use or by damaging the environment as a result of improper disposal. Residential supplies of pharmaceutically controlled substances , those found in home medicine cabinets, have become the supply source of choice for many young people and individuals abusing substance. According to the 2011 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrat ion's National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), more than 70 percent of people abusing prescription pain relievers got them through friends or relatives, a statistic that includes raiding the medicine cabinets of family and friends. Easy access to prescription drugs is one factor leading to the prescription drug epidemic and an effective method to control access is development of mechanisms for safe, convenient, and responsible disposal . The State of Tennessee has been actively engaged in two types of disposal activities: Take -Back Events and Permanent Prescription Collection Boxes . Take -back events are one-day events where the public is encouraged to discard their unused, unwanted, and expired medications including prescription drugs from their homes. In addition to removing prescription drugs from the community these events are intended to increase awareness of the prescription drug epidemic, inform the public about the need for safely disposing of prescription drugs, and raise awareness of local permanent disposal sites available year round. Prescription drug collection boxes are established as permanent disposal sites located within law enforcement agencies where community members can safely deposit prescription drugs in a secure container. To be compliant with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations, drug collection boxes must be located with a law enforcement entity to ensure access to prescription drugs is carefully control led and that substances are properly destroyed once collected. Since the beginning of 2012, the number of permanent prescription drug collection boxes has more than doubled from 36 to 82 boxes. This achievement would not have been possible without the Tenn essee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, and the Tennessee Department of Health working together to ensure the availability of disposal boxes and working with law enforcement agencies to identify and establish safe prescription drug disposal sites. One of the goals of this multi -agency collaboration is to establish at least one permanent prescription drug collection box in all 95 counties of the state. Establishing permanent prescription drug collection boxes as the method for Tennessee citizens' to routinely dispose of medications will require continued public education concerning their use and ease of access, thereby increasing their use and reducing the amount of substances available for abuse and increase home and community safety. Locations of permanent drug collection boxes may be found at https://www.tn.gov/behavioral -health/substance -abuse OF OPIOIDS IN WORKERS ' COMPENSATION MEDICAL CLAIMS The use of opioids in Workers ' Compensation is a significant component of the medical care of injured workers, not only in Tennessee but across the United States. Injuries to the back, knees, and shoulders are among the most frequently occurring workers ' compensation injuries. These injuries frequently result in the injured worker experiencing chronic pain and the use of opioids has become a routine practice in the medical care for this type of injury. A recent study by NCCI for the state of Tennessee found that 11% of workers ' compensation medical costs nationwide were attributable to drugs. In Tennessee the percentage is even higher, 16%. Of the top ten drugs prescribed for workers ' compensation patients in Tennessee, 22.5 % were opioids (Hydrocodone -Acetaminophen - 16.0 hen - 2.2%). The number of deaths attributable to accidental overdose is not tracked in Tennessee or most other states. It has been estimated that the number of deaths countrywide is in excess of 200, but that estimate may be low as the number of deaths in the two states that track opioid use would account for 25% of that estimate .1 These statistics are cause for concern and were a consideration in Public Chapter 289 passed by the General Assembly in 2013 that included a provision mandating the adoption of medical treatment guidelines to be effective January 1, 2016. Pain management will be the first guideline developed. Tennessee is one of many states that are undertaking the development of guidelines for pain management with the goal of promoting the optim um use of opioids. The table below lists the states with pain management medical treatment guidelines and the basis of those guidelines. 1 Reducing Inappropriate Opioid Use in Treatment of Injured Workers: A Policy Guide.

Op ioids should be used only after all other appropriate and available treatments for the pain condition have been exhausted.\" Supporting rationale: Modern pain medicine is a multi -disciplinary practice. When considering opioids for therapy, a practitioner should try a variety of appropriate non -opioid treatments for chronic pain prior to the initiation of narcotics, and use opioids only as a last resort. A thorough work up to support a diagnosis for opioids should include a history and physical, psycholog ical screening, functional assessment, diagnostic studies, and specialist opinions. After an appropriate diagnosis for narcotics is found then the primary care provider can initiate nonnarcotic treatment such as: 1. Non-opioid medications 2. Functional trea tments 3. Psychological treatments 4. Coordinated care with specialists 5. Injection therapy 6. Complimentary therapeutics A variety of non -opioid medications are used in pain medicine. Anti -inflammatories are a first line medication used in arthritic pain and other mild to moderate chronic pain conditions. Anti -spasmodics and muscle relaxants are useful adjuvants for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions like chronic spasticity, myofascial pain. Antidepressants and anti -neuroleptics are commonly us ed neuroadjuvants used for fibromyalgia, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathies, and myofascial pain. Antidepressants can also have an added benefit of relieving symptoms of anxiety and depression that are commonly associated with chronic pain patients. Any of the aforementioned medication that can cause sedation should be used with care if they are initiated prior to or in conjunction with narcotics. Functional treatments are restorative modalities that can help patients to improve their general mobili ty and strength while improving pain. Early in a chronic pain condition a patient should be referred to a physical therapist or occupational therapist for an assessment and treatment of a chronic pain patient's disability. Manual manipulation, strengthen ing exercises, land based therapies, aquatic therapy, electro - stimulation treatments, home exercise programs, bracing, ultrasound are part of the functional treatment armamentarium for chronic pain patients. Additionally, periodic functional assessments a re encouraged to demonstrate the efficacy of treatment prior to and after the initiation of narcotics. Often times patients will have a primary diagnosis that's best treated by a specialist while receiving concomitant chronic pain treatment. A specialist referral prior to the initiation of narcotic treatment is encouraged especially if the etiology of the chronic pain condition can be treated without narcotics and can be attenuated or cured with alternative pharmaceuticals or surgery. It is also helpful to get a specialist opinion on whether certain conditions constitute a chronic pain condition and whether that condition is best treated with narcotics. Mental health referral for a chronic pain condition is helpful early in the treatment process. Recog nition of anxiety disorders, depression, post -traumatic stress disorder, and other mental health disorders at the APPENDICES 48 beginning in the treatment of pain is important. Chronic pain is a significant stressor and providing coping mechanisms and other strategies may reduce maladaptive behaviors in patients such as overtaking pain medications and obtaining medications not prescribed to the patient. Relaxation techniques, biofeedback, individual and group sessions, and other skills are all useful adjunctive treatme nts in the chronic pain patient population. Simple injections for pain including joint injections trigger point injections, and botulinum injections have a role in the primary care providers' non-opioid treatment plan. There are some injections that are best performed by a specialist and a referral to these specialists early in a patient's care is encouraged prior to the initiation of narcotics. Also for consideration for primary care providers treating pain are other non -Allopathic treatments for pain. Chiropractic treatments, exercise, massage, alternative supplements and medications may all have a role in treating chronic pain conditions. Treatments like yoga, tai chi, acupuncture, and mindfulness meditation can attenuate pain and restore/ preserve function for some people. APPENDICES 49 ACUTE PAIN GUIDELINES Acute pain is pain present for less than 90 days. Acute and chronic pain are among the most common reasons for physician visits, for taking medications and are major causes of work disability. Severe chronic pain affects physical and mental functioning, quality of life and productivity. Acute pain may be spontaneous, surgical or due to an injury. The lowest dose for the shortest duration is recommended to avoid dependence and abuse. Long acting opioids should be avoided in the acute setting. Patient deserves pain relief. Patient should be educated that pain reduction is the goal, not being pain free. It may be difficult for the medical provider to determine whether the patient has had adequate pain re lief. Acute Low Back pain is the most common pain presentation to medical providers. Medical provider should determine if patient has Mild, Moderate, or Severe pain. Treatment Strategy : Use Multimodal approach, to include - Nonpharmacologic Therapies: Heat, Rest, Massage, Acupuncture, Physical Therapy (listed order is random). Pharmacotherapy: First -line recommendation 2 -4 weeks of non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medication drugs (NSAIDs). Second -line recommendation (if pain persists) trial of non -benzo diazepine muscle relaxant, Cochrane systematic review reveals good evidence for short term relief of acute low back pain. If pain persists after trial of above or if patient has contraindications to above Opioids may be considered but have poor evidence o f effectiveness to support use. Study showed that acute non -traumatic, non -radicular pain, non -radicular low back pain did not show difference in pain or disability after 7 days of Naproxen alone compared to Naproxen along with oxycodone. According to Ce nters for Disease Control (CDC) Opioids should be prescribed only when necessary. If opioids are being considered by medical provider should use lowest effective dose for shortest duration necessary current recommendation is for less than or equal to a 3 d ay supply (consider use of Tramadol (if not contraindicated)). Higher dose and longer duration of taking opioid has been linked to Long -term use and abuse and diversion. Medical provider should evaluate patient for Opioid Use disorder and check State C ontrolled Substance Database prior to prescribing. APPENDICES 50 PERIOPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT Perioperative pain is pain in the period before, during, and after surgery. The pain can be an acute or chronic comorbid condition, an acute or chronic condition related to t he disease or trauma for which the surgery is being performed, or occurring as a result of the surgery. Pain during the perioperative period is best managed through a combination of targeted treatment methods (multimodal analgesia) including: 1. expectation and anxiety management 2. activity and mobilization when appropriate 3. medications when needed: o non-opioid pain medications should be trialed first -line for mild to moderate pain o opioid medications for severe pain 4. regional anesthesia when appropriate Effective multimodal pain management in the perioperative period can result in improved operative and postoperative outcomes and reduce the risks of adverse outcomes related to short -term and long -term opioid exposure. Prior to Surgery If opioids will be prescribed before surgery, they shall not be used in isolation. A documented multimodal analgesic plan should accompany any prescription for pain prior to surgery. When an opioid is used to treat pain, the lowest effective dose shall be prescribed. For opioid prescr iptions longer than 3 days, the surgeon shall screen the patient for risks of misuse (including checking the CSMD) and document these in the medical record; the surgeon and patient shall review and sign an opioid contract and agreement. The patient shall b e informed of the risks of opioid medications used during and after surgery as part of the surgical informed consent, including the risks of neonatal abstinence syndrome in women of childbearing age and the risk of relapse in patients with a history of sub stance use disorder. For patients with a history of substance use disorder, a plan for management, including consultation with a specialist when appropriate should be documented. In female patients pregnant or of childbearing age, a plan for management, including consultation with a specialist when appropriate should be documented. After Surgery If opioids will be used to control operative and post -operative pain (in the hospital after surgery and at hospital discharge through the post -operative recove ry period), a multimodal analgesic plan should be documented that involves use of the 4 items listed above. If opioids will be used to treat post -operative pain, the following shall be documented by the surgeon to guide subsequent care: The relevant ICD -10 Code for the diagnosis requiring opioid medications at discharge included on the opioid prescription. The non -opioid and non -medication pain treatment options that are being used, or were considered but not indicated in the particular patient. The expec ted pain duration for the type of surgery performed. The expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids, with an accompanying taper plan. APPENDICES 51 TENNESSEE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OPIOID PRESCRIBING GUIDELINES 1. One medical provider should provide all opioi ds to treat a patient's chronic pain. 2. The administration of intravenous and intramuscular opioids in the ED for the relief of acute exacerbations of chronic pain is discour aged. 3. Emergency medical providers should not provide replacement prescriptions for controlled substances that were lost, destroyed, or stolen. 4. Emergency medical providers should not provide replacement doses of methadone for patients in a methadone treatment program. 5. Long -acting or controlled - release opioids (such as OxyContin\u00ae, fentanyl patches, and methadone) should not be prescribed from the ED. Exceptions may include terminal care and cancer -related pain. 6. ED providers are encouraged to review the Tennessee Controlled Substance Monitoring Database prior to writing prescriptions for controlled substances in the ED. 7. Physicians may send patient pain agreements to local EDs and work to include a plan for pain treatment in the ED. 8. EDs should coordinate the care of patients who frequently visit the ED using an ED care coordination pr ogram. 9. EDs should maintain a list of clinics that provide primary care for patients for all payer types. 10. EDs should perform screening, brief interventions and treatment referrals for patients with suspected substance use disorder . 11. The administration of Demerol (Meperidine) is the ED is discouraged. 12. For exacerbations of chronic pain, the emergency medical provider may contact the patient's primary opioid prescriber. The emergency medical provider should only prescribe enough pills to last until the offic e of the patient's primary opioid prescriber opens. 13. Prescriptions for opioid pain medication from the ED for acute injuries, such as fractured bones, in most cases should not exceed three days. 14. ED patients should be screened for Substance Use Disorder prior to prescribing opioid medication for acute pain. 15. The emergency physician is required by law to evaluate an ED patient who reports pain. The law allows the emergency physician to use their clinical judgement when treating pain and does not require the use of opioids. APPENDICES 52 PEDIATRICS PAIN Children of all ages deserve compassionate and effective pain treatment. As in adult pain, there are two types of pain in the pediatric setting, namely acute and chronic pain. Acute pediatric pain is defined as pain less than 3 -6 months in duration for patients ranged between 0 and 18 years . In these cases, analgesics should be used in effective doses, but pain and symptom management and supportive care should not be limited to medication alone. Healthcare practitioners should recognize that pain treatment and prevention is essential even when children are too young or cognitively unable to report the extent and severity of their pain. Fear, anxiety and even chronic pain can develop as a result of painful experiences in ch ildhood. Concerted efforts should be undertaken to reduce or eliminate anticipated acute pain whenever possible for routine medical procedures in children. For example this may include the use of topical local anesthetics for immunizations and phlebotomy, as well as penile nerve block or EMLA prior for circumcisions. Other acute pain treatments may include all of the current modalities for treating pain in adults, as well as local, general, or regional anesthesia for invasive procedures and surgeries as preemptive pain control measures. Chronic pediatric pain is defined as persistent pain for greater than 3 - 6 months for patients ranged between 0 and 18 years. Pediatric chronic pain is an under -recognized diagnosis in the United States. It is estimated t hat 11 to 38% of children in the United States suffer from a chronic pain syndrome. The number of pediatric patients admitted to US hospitals with chronic pain diagnoses increased by 831% from 2004 to 2010. For example, a typical pediatric chronic pain pa tient profile is a Caucasian female approximately 14 years old with headaches, abdominal and musculoskeletal pain, and depression and anxiety, according to a study published online July 1, 2012 in Pediatrics . Childhood chronic nonmalignant pain has significant costs due to lost wages for the family and medical utilization. In addition, both acute and chronic pain in childhood predisposes children to p ain in adulthood, continuing this cycle of disability, suffering, and economic burden through the entire life of a patient. Acute and chronic pain that goes unrecognized and untreated could lead to long -term changes in the child's nervous system and make the incidence of chronic pain as an adult more likely. Recommendations from the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics: Expand knowledge about pediatric pain and pediatric pain management principles and techniques. Provide a c alm environment for procedures that reduce distress -producing stimulation. Use appropriate pain assessment tools and techniques. Anticipate predictable painful experiences, intervene, and monitor accordingly. Use a multimodal approach (pharmacolog ic, cognitive, behavioral, and physical) to pain management and use a multidisciplinary approach when possible. Involve families and tailor interventions to the individual child. Advocate for the effective use of pain medication for children to ensur e compassionate and competent management of their pain. APPENDICES 53 The Tennessee Department of Health believes that appropriate pain care for acute and chronic pain should be available to all children. Pain treatment for all children should be multi -modal and interd isciplinary. If at all possible due to physiological effects of opioids on the body's developing hormonal and neurological systems, long -term opioid use should be avoided. The Tennessee Department of Health recognizes that pediatric chronic, non -cancer pa in is a complex, heterogeneous disease entity that requires coordinated, interdisciplinary treatment to improve patient outcomes. The Department of Health also understands that not all areas in the state will have access to interdisciplinary care teams fo r pain, so the Department of Health encourages a coordinated care model where the pediatric primary care provider consults with specialists for best practice care in these complex situations. The goal for all providers is to effectively manage the child's pain and improve function while avoiding or minimizing the use of opioids when possible Diagnosis Pediatric chronic, non -cancer pain includes persistent (ongoing) and recurrent (episodic) pain in children with chronic health conditions (e.g., arthritis or sickle cell disease) and pain that is the disorder itself (e.g., migraines, functional abdominal pain, complex regional pain syndrome) Musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, and headaches are the most common diagnosis for chronic non - cancer pain in child hood. Other diagnosis include neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders and disease -related pain such as related to sickle cell disease, arthritis, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and severe neurological impairment. Developmental and gender factors are important when considering pediatric pain diagnosis and treatment. With increasing age and more advanced pubertal development, the occurrence of pain problems can increase. Across most forms of chronic pain in childhood and adolescence, females assume a much higher prevalence in comparison to males. Assessment Comprehensive clinical assessment of a child with chronic pain and associated disability should ideally include consideration of the biological, biomechanical, psychological, and sociocultural factors within a developmental context. The initial evaluation should include a complete medical and pain history, including onset, intensity, quality, location, duration, variability, predictability, exacerbating, and alleviating factors. O ngoing management and reassessment, however, should avoid reinforcing a concern for pain intensity and rather focus on functional indicators of improvement. Psychosocial assessment of the child and family focuses on an assessment of the child's beliefs abo ut pain, emotional functioning, coping skills, and impact of pain on daily life including sleeping, eating, school, social and physical activities, and family and peer interactions. A complete physical and neurological examination that includes observation of the child's general appearance, posture, and gait should be performed with the focus on but not limited to the affected area. Basic vital signs and growth parameters should be obtained during at least the first evaluation. Judicious laboratory and ra diological studies are useful if a specific disease is suspected. APPENDICES 54 Parental and Family Roles When treating pediatric patients, the role of the parents and family is extremely important. Parents (and other caregivers) play pivotal roles as observers of c hildren's pain and interpreters of its meaning. These adults also heavily influence compliance with recommendations. Children and the adults who care for them are interdependent, and pediatric professionals must work with them as a whole. The emotional well-being and health status of the parents can influence a chronic pain child's function and the child's perceived abilities or disabilities. Maternal distress and her child's chronic pain are likely bidirectional in nature. Educating the parents and t he family are fundamental to the care of a chronic pain child, especially in the context of the child's developmental stages and the potential influences of the family's coping abilities throughout the child's formative years. Pediatric providers are enco uraged to help parents and families find resources to help them cope with the economic and emotional stresses of caring for a child with chronic pain. Interdisciplinary Treatment The goals of treatment in all chronic pain patients, including the pediatri c population, are to increase function and improve quality of life. A biopsychosocial model to treating chronic pain is appropriate for most chronic pain conditions and an interdisciplinary team is most adept at delivering the care. Referral to a pediatr ic pain program should be considered for children with complex or refractory problems. Meta -analytic reviews support the efficacy of cognitive -behavioral interventions, including relaxation, and biofeedback, for pain reduction in children with headache, a bdominal pain and musculoskeletal pain. Interdisciplinary teams often need the support of school systems, counselors, and social services. Non -opioids Non-opioid medical treatment can be helpful when indicated. Analgesics should be titrated to effect ive doses where side effects are minimized. Non -opioids are the preferred first line medications for chronic pain when possible. Specialists should be consulted for medical treatments for the underlying etiology of chronic pain in order to minimize the r eliance on analgesics. Minimally invasive treatments may be helpful in certain, select situations. The pediatric provider should consider consultation with a board certified pain specialist who is adept with pediatric cases for such injection therapy wh en conservative treatments have failed. Opioids American Pain Society's Position Statement in 2012 on the \" Assessment and Management of Children with Chronic Pain\" concludes that opioids are rarely indicated in the long -term treatment of chronic non malignant pain in children, although they may be beneficial in certain painful conditions with clearly defined etiologies (e.g., sickle cell disease, incurable degenerative joint and neurodegenerative diseases, etc.). Consultation or referral to a pediatr ic chronic pain specialist should be strongly considered in these cases. Included in this appendix will be centers in Tennessee and other states for referrals to interdisciplinary centers dedicated to the treatment of chronic pediatric pain. Tennessee De partment of Health realizes that not all patients will have the necessary resources to go to APPENDICES 55 an interdisciplinary program located in a metropolitan city. Therefore we advise that the pediatric provider coordinates with medical specialists, physical therap ists, social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists, school counselors, integrative and complementary services, support groups, and other local resources/agencies to best deliver services for the chronic pain patient and the family. If opioids a re used, pediatric providers are expected to comply with the Chronic Pain Guidelines. Pill counts, Urine Drug Tests, risk assessment, and Controlled Substance Monitoring Database checks as per Tennessee Chronic Pain Guidelines should be applied to all non -cancer chronic pain children on opioids. Parents should sign the medication agreement and be fully aware and be educated on their responsibilities to the Tennessee Chronic Pain Guidelines and standards of the state of Tennessee. Pediatric providers have the responsibility to uphold the Chronic Pain Guideline standards if their patients initiate long term opioid therapy. Additionally, pediatric pain providers should uphold the Pain Clinic Guideline standards if they have greater than 50% of their patient s on opioids. Adolescent females on opioids after their first menses should have a conversation about neonatal abstinence syndrome, and adolescent females on chronic opioids should be encouraged to start a long acting, reversible contraceptive if they bec ome sexually active. Tennessee Department of Health is also aware that diversion of medications can occur in the adult and pediatric population. Diversion in the pediatric population can occur from the parents, the care givers, family members, or friends , and there may be instances that the pediatric/adolescent patient may be involved in diversion, abuse, or misuse of medications. The pediatric pain provider must be aware of these issues and directly address these issues of medication non -compliance and diversion with the patient, parent, caregiver, and other family members. An immediate plan of care must be established when there are signs of misuse, abuse, or diversion with clear and concise documentation. It is advisable for the pediatric provider to consult with a pain specialist (as defined by the Tennessee Department of Health) annually when opioids are used for the pediatric chronic nonmalignant patient. Pediatric providers are encouraged to continue opioids in select cases and when coordinating care with other specialists including a board certified pain specialist. In the case of palliative and cancer related pain in the pediatric population, opioids may be used to relieve intractable pain. Often times in these situations, patients are under t he care of oncologists and palliative teams that are comfortable being more aggressive with opioids. Alternatives to opioids are always preferred when they are available and proven to be effective for the individual patient. Outcomes As stated before, Tennessee Department of Health believes that functional improvement is a better outcome measurement for successful treatment over pain intensity scores. Physical and emotional functioning are important outcome measures. School reintegration, socializati on with peers and family and meeting developmental milestones (when possible) are critical components to functional improvement. Improvements in sleep quality are indicators that a provider's treatment for pain is helping. Decreased emergency department visits and hospitalizations for chronic pain exacerbations are also helpful indicators of treatment efficacy. Outcome measurements are not limited to the child. Providers may also consider parental and familial outcome measures like emotional and econom ic stressors and like global treatment satisfaction. APPENDICES 56 If opioids are used, clear documentation of functional improvement with most of the aforementioned outcome measures should be clearly documented.

Studies of acute pain in dentistry demonstrate that an appropriate dose of an NSAID should manage the vast majority of moderate to severe pain experienced by dental patients. There is some evidence that suggests alternating acetaminophen with an NSAID may be beneficial for managing moderate to severe pain. Only in a minority of situations is an opioid required for patien t pain. The following guidelines should be considered prior to prescribing an opioid. 1. Check the CSMD to determine if the patient has an existing prescription for the same diagnosis over the same period of time OR if the patient is currently taking any typ e of opioid? o Yes Do not prescribe o No Evaluate risk factors: Does the patient's medical history suggest signs of substance abuse and/or diversion? Given the efficiency of non -opioids, do the benefits of prescribing an opioid outweigh the risks? Consider a lternatives to controlled substances and document in dental record Establish preliminary diagnosis, treatment plan and document in dental record o Is the prescription for pain? Mild to moderate pain First consider an NSAID or an adult dose of 1,000 mg aceta minophen q4h. If NSAID insufficient, then consider a combination of acetaminophen or an NSAID with codeine 15 -30 mg. If insufficient consider a combination of acetaminophen or an NSAID with codeine 30 -60 mg. 2. If the use of an opioid is determined to be app ropriate then: o Limit the number of tablets dispensed for any opioid prescription. For example: For codeine 15 mg combinations (e.g. Tylenol #2) maximum of 36 tablets For codeine 30 mg combinations maximum of 12 tablets For hydrocodone 5 mg or 7.5 mg comb inations maximum of 12 tablets APPENDICES 58 3. If the patient returns complaining of unmanaged pain, and this is confirmed by history and clinical examination, then: o Reassess the accuracy of the diagnosis and/or source of the patient's pain o Consider non -pharmacologic ma nagement of the patient's pain, including direct treatment (e.g., pulpectomy, incision and drainage, extraction) o Consider recommending or prescribing the maximal dose of the NSAID or acetaminophen and discontinuing the opioid o Prescribing an increased dose of the opioid should be considered last 4. If the patient returns after a second prescription for an opioid: o Advise the patient that no further prescriptions for an opioid will be issued without consulting with the patient's primary care provider and/or a de ntal specialist with expertise in pain management and referring as appropriate APPENDICES 59 TERMS/DEFINITIONS Acute Pain: pain of sudden onset usually from a single, \"fixable\" event commonly seen with surgery, accidental injury or inflam mation, however, can be from unknown cause; short duration from days to less than 3-6 months as associated with healing; considered our biological red flag that sends warning signals through the nervous system that something is either wrong within the body or that a hurtful activity should be avoided to prevent further or repeat damage. ABAM: American Board of Addiction Medicine. The American Board of Addiction Medicine, Inc. (ABAM) is a not-for-profit 501 (c)(6) organization whose mission is to examine and certify diplomats. It was founded in 2007 following conferences of committees appointed by the American Society of Addiction Medicine. This action was taken as a method of identifying the qualified specialists in Addiction Medicine. ABAM offers a rigorous certifying examination that was developed by an expert panel and the National Board of Medical Examiners, as well as maintenance of certification examination to ensure that ABAM - certified physicians maintain life- long competence in Addiction Medicine. (From ABAM Web Site.) ABMS : American Board of Medical Specialties. The ABMS is comprised of 24 medical specialty Member Boards. AOA: American Osteopathic Association. The AOA serves as the professional family for more than 104,000 osteopathic physicians (D Os) and osteopathic medical students. The AOA promotes public health and encourages scientific research. In addition to serving as the primary certifying body for DOs, the AOA is the accrediting agency for all osteopathic medical schools and has federal au thority to accredit hospitals and other health care facilities. ASAM: American Society of Addiction Medicine. American Society of Addiction Medicine is a professional society representing over 3,000 physicians and associated professionals dedicated to increasing access and improving the quality of addiction treatment; educating physicians, other medical professionals and the public; supporting research and prevention; and promoting the appropriate role of physicians in the care of patients with addictions. (From ASAM Web Site.) Allodynia: pain caused by a stimulus or action that does not normally cause pain, like light touch, pressure or a gentle breeze on skin. Chronic Pain: pain lasting longer than expected healing time, may last for many months, years or a lifetime, may be constant or in intervals; cause may be unknown or result of recent or previous acute pain episode; may be related to another chronic disorder, such as arthritis, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, or cancer. Hyperalgesia: an increase d response to a stimulus that normally would induce a mild discomfort. MAT: is the use of medications with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a \"whole -patient\" approach to treatment of substance use disorders. MAT is primarily used for the tr eatment of addiction to opioids such as heroin and prescription pain relievers that contain opiates. The prescribed medication operates to normalize brain chemistry, block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids, relieve physiological cravings, and nor malize body functions without the negative effects of the abused drug. APPENDICES 60 While MAT may be a viable option for some patients, it is simply a tool in the toolkit when treating substance use disorders, and appropriate therapy should be chosen in consultation w ith a licensed healthcare provider.2 MME: Morphine Milligram Equivalents Neuropathic Pain: chronic pain caused by the nervous system. Nociceptive Pain: acute pain as a response to a noxious stimulus. Opioid Na\u00efve: patients who are not chronically receivin g opioid analgesics on a daily basis. Opioid Tolerant: patients who are chronically receiving opioid analgesics on a daily basis. Pain: is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Pain is personal and subjective. Pain Medicine Specialist: Pain Medicine is the medical specialty dedicated to the prevention, evaluation and treatment of people with chronic pain. Additionally (See Pain Medicine Specialist Appendix) Palliative care : is specialized medical c are for people facing serious illness, focusing on providing relief of suffering (physical, psychosocial, and spiritual), to maximize quality of life for both the patient and the family. Within palliative care, serious illness is defined as a health condit ion that carries a high risk of mortality and negatively impacts a person's daily function and/or quality of life; and/or excessively strains caregivers.3 Somatic Pain: pain originating from the muscles and/or bones.
