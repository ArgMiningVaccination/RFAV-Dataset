In the period following transfer, the trans formation envisioned by the tripartite health plans and agreements can be seen in emerging changes to programs and services as well within the broader health system . Changes will continue as programs and services are reviewed and adapted to further align with the First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness and the 7 Directives t hat guide FNHA operations. Purpose The purpose of this FNHA Programs and Services Guide is to provide a listing and detailed description of First Nations Health Programs and Services to be delivered or funded during the period covered by the FN HA Multi -Year Health Plan in accordance with th e Canada Funding Agreement Section s 5.3 (1) and 5.4 (1)(e). This document is intended to encompass programs funded by the Canada Funding Agreement , and it also includes a section summarizing programs supported by funding received from the federal government via the Canada Consolidated Contribution Agreement . Program and Service Delivery As described below, the FNHA enables programs and services in several different and complementary ways. FNHA -Funded: A signif icant number of programs and services are funded by the FNHA and delivered by communities and their mandated health organizations. Funding Arrangements describe the funding relationship, mandatory program requirements and accountability expectations betwee n the FNHA and the funding recipient. Depending on the nature of the Funding Arrangement, communities have significant flexibility in the design and delivery of the programs described in this Guide, in areas including mental health, wellness programs and h ealthy child development. Shared decision -making and partnerships between reg ional health authorities, First Nations within the regions, and the FNHA continue to grow, strengthen a nd evolve, particularly when supported by emerging data a nd evidence, and the sharing of successes across regions . New recipients represent new aggregated health service delivery entitie s amongst BC First Nations and health authority partners as a result of the implementation 2 of the regional enveloping process that supports new and innovative service delivery projects . FNHA -Delivered : The FNHA also directly delivers a number of programs and services, many of which directly relate to and support the local programs and services delivered by communities. These include Health Benefits, Environmental Public Health, Health Protection, Nursing , and Surveillance and Research . As part of the transform ation in BC, the FNHA is increasingly assuming direct service delivery in new areas , including within primary hea lth care and mental health and wellness service areas . A stream of funding within the Canada Funding Agreement supports the broader commitments of the tripartite p arties in implementing the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan, mainly in the areas of community engagement and governance. Beyond the Canada Funding Agreement funding, the FNHA receives federal funding through a Canada Consolidated Funding Agreement in support of a number of new or expanded programs and services. This Guide describes the programs and services in each of the above areas. As noted in the introduction, a number of program reviews , new FNHA service lines and capabilities, and other improvements are being impleme nted that will result in the ongoing innovation, improvement and transformation of the suite of programs described herein and in the FNHA Multi -Year Health Plan . See Appendix 2 for a list of contacts for each program area . Note that these contacts may change over time. This guide is updated annually to reflect changes in FNHA programming and associated policy frameworks . If you are unable to contact a program/service area lead, please call FNHA at 1-604-693-6500/Toll Free: 1 -866-913-0033. 3 Section 1: Health Benefits First Nations Health Benefits Dental Medical Supplies & Equipment Medical Transportation Mental Health Pharmacy Vision Care Oral Health Program Dental Therapy Program Children's Oral Health Initiative 4 First Nations Health Benefits Overview The Health Benefits Program is a key FNHA program that administers health benefits and manages the Medical Services Plan for Health Benefits clients . FNHA assumed responsibility for the Health Benefits Program on July 2, 2013. To ensure continui ty of services for Health Benefits clients , FNHA entered into a \"buyback\" agreement by purchasing the administration of some benefits from Indigenous Services Canada's Non -Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program. This has allowed FNHA time to establish the necessary systems and infrastructure to facilitate transition from NIHB to alternative providers selected by FNHA. The first phase of this transition took effect on October 1, 2017, with the majority of drug benefit administration transitioning from NIHB to BC PharmaCare and other agencies established within BC to provide necessary benefits to all British Columbians. This transition was intended to improve access to benefits and services, support Health Benefits clients to have access to services available to all other provincial residents, streamline the approval process for limited coverage drugs, and address the need for Health Benefits clients to navigate both federal and provincial services . On September 16, 2019, FNHA completed the transition of ser vices from NIHB when the administration of dental, vision care, medical supplies and equipment and some pharmacy benefits transitioned to Pacific Blue Cross. Guided by the direction provided by communities and Health Benefits clients , and working in align ment with the FNHA's vision and plans, the Health Benefits Program administers benefit coverage for medical and dental services that are not covered by provincial, federal or third -party insurance plans. The Health Benefits Program is delivered in partners hips with federal and provincial governments, service providers and most importantly, with First Nations communities, to provide coverage for health benefits. Additionally, the Health Benefits Program supports access to essential medical care for Health Be nefits clients by managing the Medical Services Plan (MSP) and covering ambulance bills for Health Benefits clients . The Health Benefits Program approaches its work through relationships with health partners and aims to deliver person -centred benefits within the parameters of our funding and structural framework. 5 Program Objectives The Health Benefits Program strives to provide health benefits to Health Benefi ts clients in a manner that : provides benefits appropriate to their unique health needs and enables access to those benefits in a manner that meets people where they're at; empowers individuals to take ownership over their health and wellness journey and reinforces FNHA's role as a partner in those journeys; contributes to the achievement of an overall health status that is comparable to the Canadian population as a whole; is managed in a cost -effective manner that promotes transparency and administrative e fficiency and simplicity, whenever possible; is integrated with the provincial health system; demonstrates strong partnerships with provincial and federal governments, service providers and BC First Nations communities; promotes cultural safety and humilit y in the health care system; and champions the BC First Nations Perspective on Health and Wellness and embeds this philosophy throughout the health care system, shifting the system from a sickness -treatment model into a wellness model. Program Principles Informed by these objectives and FNHA's 7 Directives, the Health Benefits Program is guided by the following principles: provide coverage for medically necessary items and services, as well as travel to access medically necessary health services; strive t o provide comprehensive coverage that limits out -of-pocket costs to Health Benefits clients , whenever possible; provide coverage that is, at minimum, comparable to the federal NIHB Program and informed by professional medical judgment and industry standar ds; and be consistent with best practices of health services delivery and evidence -based standards of care. Eligibility Health Benefits clients must meet the eligibility criteria that are mandated by the Health Benefits Sub -Agreement. In order to be eligi ble for the Health Benefits Program, an individual must be : 6 a) a registered Indian according to the Indian Act or an infant up to 24 months old of an eligible parent ; b) a resident of British Columbia, as defined by the Medical Services Plan ; and c) not funded or insured under any other benefit system or benefit plans provided by i) federal legislation, a federal policy or under agreements entered into by Canada, and/or ii) a First Nations organization pursuant to self -government agreements, land claim ag reements, contribution arrangements or internal policies or plans. Health Benefits clients receiving pharmacy benefits must have active Medical Services Plan coverage in addition to the eligibility criteria above. The federal government may change the e ligibility criteria for the Health Benefits Program in accordance with the British Columbia Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance . FNHA will, at minimum, adopt the changes set by the federal government but may choose to extend el igibility beyond what the federal government has set out. FNHA also has agreements to manage the Medical Services Plan for non -Health Benefits clients that are not governed by the Programs and Services Guide . Providers The Health Benefits Program works to ensure that Health Benefits clients receive care from providers who have the relevant training and qualifications necessary for their role and who operate within their scope of practice, as appropriate . 7 Health Benefit Areas In accordance with the British Columbia Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance , the Health Benefits Program will, at a minimum, provide health benefits in the areas of pharmaceuticals, dental care services, vision care services, medical transportation, and medical supplies and equipment. Currently, the Health Benefits Program pays for specific items and services under the following benefit areas for eligible Health Benefits clients : Dental The dental benefit provides coverage for dental services to maintain good oral health, prevent cavities and gum disease, and restore function. Medical Supplies & Equipment The medical supplies and equipment benefit provides coverage for certain medical items for Health Benefits clients who receive care at home. Medical Transportation The medical transportation benefit supports Health Benefits clients accessing medically necessary health services not available in their community of residence. Health Benefits Clients may be provided with funding for meals, accommoda tion, and transportation as required. Mental Health The mental health benefit provides Health Benefits clients with access to counselling services from a qualified mental health provider. Pharmacy The pharmacy benefit provides coverage for pharmacy it ems and medications, including prescription and over -the-counter items. Vision Care The vision care benefit provides coverage for eye exams and prescription eyewear to ensure Health Benefits clients maintain good eye health. Coordination of Benefits 8 In accordance with the program's principles, the Health Benefits Program is intended to be integrated with the provincial health care system as one aspect of a Health Benefits Client's journey. To ensure sustainability of the Health Benefits Program, FNHA is the last payor for dental, medical supplies and equipment, medical transportation, mental health, vision care, and pharmacy benefits administered by FNHA, Pacific Blue Cross or funding recipients. FNHA is the first payor for pharmacy benefits administered by BC PharmaCare. Oral Health Program In addition to FNHA's Dental Care b enefit, the Oral Health P rogram supports a holistic approach to First Nations' oral health and wellness by offering prevention, education and treatment -based dental services to First Nations people living on -reserve. The program includes both the Dental Therapy Program and the Children 's Oral Health Initiative . Additionally, the Oral Health Program partners with communities, organizations, educ ational institutions, providers and others to bring dental services closer to home. Objectives Reduce and prevent oral disease through prevention, education, necessary treatment and oral health promotion. Increase access to oral health care. Dental Therapy Program The Dental Therapy Prog ram helps increase access to oral health care in First Nations communities, particularly in remote and isolated locations.

Clinical and Client Care Clinical and Client Care consists of essential health care services directed towards First Nations individuals, living primarily in remote and isolated communities, which enable them to receive the clinic al care they need in their home communities. It is provided either directly by FNHA or through contribution agreements with First Nation Bands or Tribal Councils in locations where these services are not provided by provincial health systems. Clinical and Client Care is often the first point of individual contact with the health system and is delivered by collaborative health care practice teams, predominantly nurse led, providing integrated and accessible assessment, diagnostic, curative and rehabilitative services for urgent and non -urgent care. The continuum of Clinical and Client Care is inclusive of health promotion and disease prevention at the client/family level in the course of treatment ; Primary Care and Population and Public Health Care ; and the c oordination and integration of care and referral to appropriate provincial secondary and tertiary levels 13 of care outside the community. Physician visits, Nurse Practitioner visits, ambulatory and emergency services are components of Clinical and Client Car e services provided in some First Nations communities. Objectives Provide access to emergency/urgent and non -urgent health services to community members including those who reside in remote/isolated communities where access to health services is not avail able through provincial or regional health authorities. Provide access to coordination and consultation services with other appropriate health care providers and/or institutions as indicated by client needs.

Communicable Disease Control The primary focus of the Communicable Disease Control Team is to ensure that current practice and new developments in C ommunicable Diseas e Control and population and public health prevention programs are deliver ed with a First Nations focus. The Communicable Disease Control programs are delivered as per the mandatory communicable disease (CD) Programs, legislated under the Health Act (1981) and the Public Health Act (2008). The control and prevention of CDs legislated under the Health Act are mandatory programs under health transfer agreements and are delivered in First Nations communities by Community Health Nurses . The Communicable Disease Control program supports implementation and sustainment of the provincial public health system. 17 Program support by the Communicable Disease Control Team includes prevention and control of many prevalent CDs and are organized under the following portfolio s: Immunization Sexually transmitted & blood borne infection/ harm reduction/ HIV/ hepatitis C virus Tuberculosis (TB) CD management and Follow -up Pandemic and CD emergencies Panorama Public Health System implementation and supports The team provides timely information on best practices of communicable disease control and outbreak management for Community Health Nurses , Home Care Nurses , Licensed Practicing Nurses , Community Health Representatives , Community Health Workers and Health Directors working within First Nations CD programs. The team supports the development of Community CDC Health/Work Plans upon request from community. Communicable Disease Control Overview Communicable Disease Control ( CDC ) programs aim to reduce the incidence, spread and human h ealth effects of CDs, as well as improve health through prevention and health promotion activitie s of on -reserve First Nations. The burden of CDs remains of particular concern in some on -reserve First Nations communities and can be linked to common underly ing risk factors that enable further exposure and spread of disease. Significantly elevated levels of CDs (such as TB and HIV, as well as HIV -TB co -infection) are further complicated by issues of remoteness, limited access to health services, social stigma tization and socio -economic issues. Health Protection CDC management programs and initiatives support public health measures to mitigate these underlying risk factors by: Preventing, treating and controlling cases and outbreaks of CDs (e.g., immunization, TB and sexually transmitted infection screening, TB Directly Observed Therapy ). Promoting public education and awareness to encourage healthy practices. Strengthening community capacity (e.g. , to prepare for and respond to pandemic influenza). Collaborati ng with the Health Surveillance Department to identify risks (e.g. , surveillance and reporting). Creating and delivering culturally appropriate CDC Public Health training. In collaboration with other regional health authorities , CDC programming focuses on communicable disease management, vaccine preventable diseases, blood borne diseases 18 and sexually transmitted i nfection s, TB infections and disease and CD emergencies. A number of these activities are closely linked with those undertaken in the environmental health programming area, particularly as they relate to waterborne, foodborne and zoonotic infectious diseases. Health Protection CDC works with commu nities and health care teams to identify strengths and opportunities in CDC Public Health Programs and communicates and cultivates open dialogue with First Nation s communities, health care teams, FNHA colleagues, the First Nations Health Directors Associat ion and external partners. Immunization Program The immunization program focuses on increasing uptake of routine infant series and preschool immunization as well as routine immunization across the lifespan. The overall expected outcomes are to improve cov erage rates for routine immunizations, reduce vaccine -preventable disease incidence and outbreaks , and to support the development of an enhanced immunization surveillance system. Objectives Ensure equitable access to newly rec ommended vaccines through BC Ministry of Health funding and BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) . Improve the coverage rates of routine immunizations for children between the ages of two and seven . Improve data and understanding of immunization health surveillance coverage rates, the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases, barriers to immunization and best practices in implementation. Ensure excellence in immunization program delivery in BC First Nation s Communities by Registered Nurses/Community Health Nurse s. Components Service Delivery : Provides d irect immunization -related services on -reserve by Community Health Nurses . These include administering vaccines according to appropriate BC schedules; notifying residents when they are due for vaccines; and forecasting effectively for v accine equipment needs while monitoring wastage.

It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentia lly affect health. According to the World Health Organization , it is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health -supportive environments. Conditions in the environment, both natural and human -built, can affect a person's ability to achieve and maintain good health. A healthy environment includes safe water and food supplies; properly designed, constructed and maintained housing and community facilities; and suitable treatment and disposal of wastewater and solid waste. To maintain a healthy envi ronment, it is also necessary to plan for and respond to emergencies and work to prevent and control communicable diseases. The FNHA's Environmental Public Health Services (EPHS) Team works in partnership with First Nations communities to identify and pre vent environmental public health risks in First Nations communities that could impact the health of community members. Where public health risks are identified, recommendations are provided to reduce these risks. Through community training, education and a wareness, community capacity is increased to achieve a healthy and safe environment. EPHS aims to reach an equivalent or better standard of environmental health as non -First Nations communities. The FNHA EPHS Team provides services to all First Nations communities2 in the province of BC. The following is a list of areas of responsibility based on the needs of the communities: Drinking water safety Food safety Health and housing Wastewater Solid waste disposal Facilities inspections Communicable disease control Emergency preparedness and response Environmental contamina nts Activities such as assessments, training sessions and public education are routine ly provided according to community work plans developed with Chief and Council or as requir ed at the request of Chief and Council or their administration. FNHA Environmental Public Health Services are carried out by Envi ronmental Health Officers who work with communities to provide advice, guidance, educa tion, public health assessments and 2 FNHA does not provide EPHS to Tsawwassen First Nation (treaty), and is currently determining its service approach to treaty/self -governing nations. 43 recommendations to First Nations and their leadership to help them prevent and manage public health risks asso ciated with the environment. Environmental Health Officers visit First Nations communities at home (on -reserve) to inspect and assess environ mental public health hazards and provide education and training sessions. They gather and analyze data to make recommendations on what steps can be taken to promote public health in First Nations communities. Environmental Health Officers do not hold legis lative authorities under the BC Public Health Act ; recommendations are provided to Chief and Council, who have the responsibility of addressing and implementing the recommendations. Guiding Principl es Work with First Nations communities as active partners in environmental public health programming. Collaborate with public health workers, provincial and local health authorities, First Nations organizations and other federal, provincial and municipal departments and agencies when delivering environmental pub lic health programming in First Nations communities. Strive for a level of on -reserve Environmental Public Health Services comparable to that available off -reserve. Objectives Identify and prevent environmental public health risks that could affect the he alth of community residents. Recommend corrective action and health promotion that may be taken by community leaders and residents to reduce these risks. Build community capacity to prevent and manage environmental health risks.

Health Systems Transformation Primary Care and eHealth Overview eHealth, the use of information management and communication technologies in health serv ices, is an area of development, and in some cases implement s services , that offer tools , services and strategies to improve effectiveness of health services for First Nations communities. Current eHealth initiatives include Telehealth, Health Grade Connectivity and electronic medical record (E MR)/electronic health record (E HR). Telehealth (Virtual Care) is the use of communication technologies such as videoconferencing to deliver health and educational services from a distance - either in synchronous and asynchronous mode . This will allow health care professionals to deliver some services remo tely using technology. Devices such as exam cameras, stethoscopes, portable ultrasound machines and ophthalmoscopes can be attached to videoconferencing units to enhance clinical sessions. Health Grade Connectivity refers to the degree a community is conn ected to the Internet via broadband services that is health grade . Health grade, simply put , is Internet 56 connectivity that is highly secure, monitored, reliable and fast. Broadband connectivity provides improved access to Internet services and the degree to which a community or organization is connected through this technology. Primarily Internet -based communications require technological infrastructure that is limited in some rural and remote communities. Lack of sufficient infrastructure is a problem face d by many First Nations in BC. EMRs/EHRs are important because at the point of care, the attending physician or nurse has access to prior and current medical history. Using electronic records helps alert medical professionals if there are certain predispos itions, conditions and contraindications in medications. EMR/EHRs provide improved information and better access to records that assist health professionals in decision making to improve health outcomes. e-Health Infostructure Program The e -Health Infostructure P rogram supports the use of health technology to enable First Nation s community front line healthcare providers to improve people's health through innovative eHealth partnerships, technologies, tools and services. It focuses on the strategic investment in , and adoption of , modern systems of information and communications technologies for the purpose of defining, collecting, communicating, managing, disseminating and using data to enable better access, quality and productivity in the health and health care of First Nations. The program evolved out of the need for FNHA to align with First Nations' e -health strategies, health plans and policy directions, as well as the movement by provinces/territories and the health industry towards increased use of information and communication technologies to support health service delivery and public health surveillance. Moreover, e -Health Infostructure (information + systems + technology + people) has the benefit of modernizing, transforming and susta ining hea lth care to provide: optimal health services delivery (primary and community care included); optimal health surveillance; effective health reporting, plan ning and decision making; and integration/compatibility with other health services delivery. Objectives Long -term objectives: An electronic health record capacity and capability for First Nations and seamless integration with provincial el ectronic health records systems . The establishment of innovative First Nations health governance appropriately integrated with other h ealth systems (e.g. , provinces) . Improved First Nations capacity to influence and/or control (design, deliver and manag e) health programs and services . A robust data governance structure that will facilitate efficient and effective sharing 57 of electronic information for primary health services' needs. Supported by the following medium -term objectives: Continue to investigate alternate service delivery mechanisms that generate new services where demand is warranted, improve access to existing services and facilitate effective decision making to improve First Nations health and health service delivery . Increase effectiveness and efficiency in the use of e -Health Infostructure applications . Increase engagement of key stakeholders in the integration of health services and the creation and maintenance of collaborati ve and sustainable partnerships . Increase First Nation s management of e-Health Infostructure . Ensure g reater access to h ealth data for First Nations, health car e providers and decision makers . Increase use of e -health systems that meet pr ovincial and national standards . Components Program Managemen t, Planning, Governance and Accountability : Ensure s the development, support and implementation of good management practices , including but not limited to appropriate and effective resource and activity monitoring and control systems; project reporting mec hanisms; and effective financial and project planning. Service Provision : o Community -level health services supported and/or provided by FNHA are Telehealth (Virtual Care) and community health infostructure services. o Telehealth (Virtual Care) services provide access to care that remote and isolated First Nations communities might not otherwise have, as well as, enhancing existin g health programs and services. Telehealth (Virtual Care) services include, but are not limited to televisitation for family me mbers; tele - education for workers and community members; and remote clinical consultations for health issues such as diabetes and mental health. o As appropriate connectivity is the basic requirement for Telehealth (Virtual Care) , FNHA works with First Nati ons leadership, private sector companies, provincial governments and other federal entities such as Department of Indigenous Services Canada and Industry Canada to facilitate on -reserve connectivity and the adoption of information and communications techno logies. o Building on connectivity and Telehealth (Virtual Care) , FNHA works with First Nations and other key partners to improve and expand existing services through health infostructure initiatives. These include, but are not limited to, the development of client registries, the integration of services into a comprehe nsive electronic medical record and linking on -reserve and 58 provincial health data in a secure, private and culturally appropriate manner. Capacity Building : Community -level capacity building is conducted in three main areas: human resources; infrastructure; and governance. Training is provided to health professionals working in on -reserve First Nations communities, Community Health Worker s, and admi nistrative and support staff on information and communications technologies. As mentioned above, Telehealth also facilitates distance training for other health services in remote and isolated First Nation s communities. Infrastructure capacity is built through efforts to improve the Internet connectivity of remote and isolated communities and ensure adequate information and communication technology equipment is available. By supporting community needs assessment s, change management strategies and new information/information technology manageme nt structures, the FNHA works with First Nations to increase governance capacity and ensure appropriate e -Health Infostructure governance mechanisms are in place. This facilitates both the adoption of new health technologies and their effective use once im plemented. Stakeholder Engagement and Collaboration : The FNHA works closely with First Nations leadership, other federal departments and entities, provincial governments, private sector and non -governmental organizations to ensure strategies and program in itiatives are inclusive, well -planned, well -run and fully coordinated with other federal, provincia l and First Nation s activities. A key objective is to promote and facilitate appropriate integration among First Nations and provincial health systems. Policy Development and Knowledge Sharing : The FNHA strives to ensure e -Health Infostructure -related policy development is relevant, well -informed and coordinated with key partners. T his is done by continuously sharing knowledge on health information and co mmunications technologies and innovations with private sector organizations, other government entities at th e provincial and federal levels and First Nations through formal and informal networks. 59 Health Emergency Management Health Emergency Management facilitates coordinated FNHA activities in response to emergencies that may impact the health of BC First Nations community members. Through collaboration and partnership with various federal, provincial, regional and non - governmental health organizations, Health Emergency Management ensures that First Nations communities are effectively incorporated into emergency preparedness, prevention, response and recovery activities. Objectives Ensure that communities are effectively linked within the provincial eme rgency response system and receive emergency management support at a level equivalent to non -First Nations.
