Crystal Rock Holdings Inc ( [AMEX:CRVP](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nysemkt-crvp/crystal-rock-holdings?unique_symbol=AMEX:CRVP&l=1&t=qrog_fp_lnubb&s=3&id=346754&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=finance_user<=Intro_ticker&utm_campaign=Intro_ticker)) is a small-cap stock with a market capitalization of US$20.61M. While investors primarily focus on the growth potential and competitive landscape of the small-cap companies, they end up ignoring a key aspect, which could be the biggest threat to its existence: its financial health. Why is it important? So, understanding the company's financial health becomes crucial, since poor capital management may bring about bankruptcies, which occur at a higher rate for small-caps. Here are a few basic checks that are good enough to have a broad overview of the company's financial strength. However, since I only look at basic financial figures, I recommend you [dig deeper yourself into CRVP here](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nysemkt-crvp/crystal-rock-holdings?unique_symbol=AMEX:CRVP&l=1&t=qrog_fp_lnubb&s=3&id=346754&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=finance_user<=Conc_ticker&utm_campaign=Conc_ticker). Does CRVP generate an acceptable amount of cash through operations? CRVP's debt levels have fallen from US$18.77M to US$14.63M over the last 12 months - this includes both the current and long-term debt. With this debt payback, CRVP's cash and short-term investments stands at US$1.07M , ready to deploy into the business. Additionally, CRVP has produced US$2.23M in operating cash flow during the same period of time, resulting in an operating cash to total debt ratio of 15.27%, indicating that CRVP's debt is not appropriately covered by operating cash. This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In CRVP's case, it is able to generate 0.15x cash from its debt capital. Does CRVP's liquid assets cover its short-term commitments? With current liabilities at US$8.20M, it appears that the company has been able to meet these commitments with a current assets level of US$11.56M, leading to a 1.41x current account ratio. For Beverage companies, this ratio is within a sensible range since there is a bit of a cash buffer without leaving too much capital in a low-return environment. Does CRVP face the risk of succumbing to its debt-load? Since total debt levels have outpaced equities, CRVP is a highly leveraged company. This is not unusual for small-caps as debt tends to be a cheaper and faster source of funding for some businesses. We can test if CRVP's debt levels are sustainable by measuring interest payments against earnings of a company. Ideally, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) should cover net interest by at least three times. For CRVP, the ratio of 1.07x suggests that interest is not strongly covered, which means that lenders may refuse to lend the company more money, as it is seen as too risky in terms of default. Next Steps: At its current level of cash flow coverage, CRVP has room for improvement to better cushion for events which may require debt repayment. Though, the company exhibits an ability to meet its near term obligations should an adverse event occur. This is only a rough assessment of financial health, and I'm sure CRVP has company-specific issues impacting its capital structure decisions.
