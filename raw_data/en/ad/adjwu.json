If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission [Here's our process](/product-selection-process). Medical News Today only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.Our team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we: - Evaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm? - Fact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence? - Assess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate the vitamin and supplement industry, which can make identifying the top brands difficult. The best vitamin brands will provide a wide range of products and use third-party testing. This article discusses how some organizations assess the quality of [vitamins and supplements](/vitamins-minerals-supplements) and reviews some of the best vitamin brands a person may wish to consider.

Although the FDA does require that manufacturers of vitamins follow [Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmps/), this is not a widely enforced standard. That said, the FDA does take action against adulterated or misbranded dietary supplements. Third-party testing People can determine the quality of a vitamin or dietary supplement by looking for brands certified by various third-party organizations. Manufacturers can volunteer for third-party testing to indicate that their products are reliable and safe. Products undergoing third-party testing may have undergone evaluation for: - standardized quality between batches - correctly stated dosage - ingredient purity - potentially harmful contaminants - label transparency Vitamins may have a certificate of analysis (COA), which declares that a product has undergone testing for safety and quality. Some third-party organizations that assess vitamin and supplement brands include the [Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG)](https://www.bscg.org/), [ConsumerLab.com](https://www.consumerlab.com/), and [NSF International](https://www.nsfsport.com/our-mark.php).
