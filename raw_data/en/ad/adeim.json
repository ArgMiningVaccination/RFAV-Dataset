It is most often consumed as an iced tea but can also be enjoyed hot, or you can also combine it with other ingredients to create flavorful beverages. The soothing flavor of peppermint makes it the perfect drink to soothe frazzled nerves and enjoy during any time of day. Peppermint has many potential health benefits, which we'll review in this article. It also has a few side effects worth noting. Below, we will tackle the things you need to know. Peppermint Tea Health Benefits Peppermint tea is often consumed for its flavor, but it also is also believed to have several [health benefits.](https://betterme.world/articles/puer-tea-benefits-side-effects/) The tea itself has rarely been studied scientifically, but peppermint extracts have.

Peppermint Tea Side Effects As with all herbs, peppermint tea can cause [side effects](https://betterme.world/articles/lavender-chamomile-tea-benefits-side-effects/) in some people. People who have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal spasms should avoid using peppermint tea or at least consult a doctor before doing so ( [12](https://www.webmd.com/diet/peppermint-tea-good-for-you#1)). Peppermint may interact with medications that are processed by the same enzyme pathways as the liver. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, dizziness, restlessness, and irritability. So, again, drink peppermint tea only under a doctor's supervision to avoid potential side effects ( [12](https://www.webmd.com/diet/peppermint-tea-good-for-you#1)). If you're allergic to menthols or menthol-producing [plants](https://betterme.world/articles/oolong-tea-benefits-side-effects/), like mint, corn mint, and birch, it's best to avoid peppermint tea. Peppermint oil is also not recommended during pregnancy without first talking to your doctor because it has not been well-studied ( [12](https://www.webmd.com/diet/peppermint-tea-good-for-you#1)). The Bottom Line Peppermint tea is a tasty herbal remedy with potential health benefits. However, peppermint tea benefits are limited to minor health problems and do not work as a miracle weight loss solution. Peppermint should be used as a medicine only under a doctor's supervision, especially if you are taking other medications. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor.
