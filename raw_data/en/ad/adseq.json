In addition to traditional apartments and houses, specialized options that include independent living, assisted living, nursing homes, and continuing care provide various on-site services that support residents through the aging process. Independent Living communities provide housing and services for active and independent older adults. Services typically include congregate meals, on-site recreational activities, and security services. Assisted Living communities serve older adults who need some assistance with daily living. In addition to housing and on-site recreational activities, assisted living communities typically offer help with personal care (bathing, dressing, grooming), housekeeping, meal preparation, and medication assistance. Some communities offer specialized services for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Nursing Homes provide care for individuals who need skilled nursing on a regular basis, but who do not need hospitalization. In addition to skilled care, nursing homes typically offer most of the services available at assisted and independent living communities, including personal care (bathing, dressing, grooming), housekeeping, meal preparation, medication assistance, and on-site recreational activities. Nursing homes also typically offer social services. Some nursing homes provide short-term rehabilitation in addition to long-term care. Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) provide multiple levels of long-term care (independent living, assisted living, and nursing home care) all within a single community. Typically, CCRCs require residents to sign long-term contracts.
