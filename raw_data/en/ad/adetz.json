The information provided in no way represents a guarantee of payment. Benefits for all claims will be based on the patient's eligibility, provisions of the Law, and regulations and instructions from the Health Plan and the Department of Managed Health Care. It is the responsibility of each provider or practitioner submitting claims to become familiar with billing, coverage and requirements. Sharp HealthCare will make every effort to ensure the information contained in this guide is accurate and current. The edition date appears on each page. However, because regulations can change frequently, it is the responsibility of each provider or practitioner to keep abreast of billing and payment requirements. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 4 of 103 CLAIMS SCANNING OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR ) Sharp Healthcare is using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to capture claims information directly from the CMS-1500 claim form. OCR benefits include: Greater efficiency; Improved accuracy; More control over the data input, and Reduced data entry cost. With the OCR system, it is important that claims be submitted with proper and legible coding. This is because the OCR output is largely dependent on the accuracy and legibility of the claim form submitted. If you are not billing electronically, consider it! However, when you bill on paper, follow these tips when completing your CMS-1500 forms. The print should be: Legible. Change typewriter ribbon/PC printer cartridge frequently, if necessary. Laser printers are recommended. Black Ink. Pica, Courier 10, or Courier 12 font type. CAPITAL letters. The font must NOT have: Broken characters, Script, Stylized print, Italic print, Mini-font, or Proportional pitch (use only typefaces that have the same width for each character). Avoid Dot Matrix font. Do NOT bill with: Liquid correction fluid changes. Data touching box edges or running outside of numbered boxes (instead, center claim information in each box). Exception: when using the 8-digit date format, information may be typed over the dotted lines shown in date fields, i.e., Item 24a. More than six service lines per claim (use a new form for additional services); Narrative descriptions of procedure, narrative description of modifier or narrative description of diagnosis (the CPT, Modifier or ICD-9 CM codes are sufficient); Stickers or rubber stamps (such as \"tracer\", \"corrected billing,\" provider name and address, etc); Special characters (i.e., hyphens, periods, parentheses, dollar signs and ditto marks). Handwritten claims, Attachments smaller than 8 \u00bd x 11. The claim form must be: An original CMS-1500 or UB 1450 printed in red \"drop out\" ink with the printed information on back (photocopies are not acceptable); Size - 8 \u00bd\" x 11\" with the printer pin-feed edges removed at the perforations; Free from crumples, tears, or excessive creases (to avoid this, submit claims in an envelope that is full letter size or larger); Thick enough (20-22lbs.) to keep information on the back from showing through; Clean and free from stains, tear-off pad glue, notations, circles or scribbles, strike-overs, crossed out information or white out. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 5 of 103 SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 6 of 103 PREPARING THE CMS-1500 CLAIM FORM The CMS-1500 answers the needs of many health insurers. It is the basic form prescribed by CMS for the Medicare program for claims from physicians and suppliers (except for ambulance services). It has also been adopted by the Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program for the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) and has received the approval of the American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Medical Services. Instructions require the reporting of 8-digit dates in all date of birth fields (items 3, 9b, and 11a), and either 6-digit or 8-digit dates in all other fields (items 11b, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 24a, and 31). Providers of service and suppliers have the option of entering either 6 or 8-digit dates in items 14, 16, 18, 19, or 24a. However, if a provider of service or supplier chooses to enter 8-digit dates for items 14, 16, 18, 19, 24a, he or she must enter 8-digit dates for all these fields. For instance, a provider or supplier will not be permitted to enter 8-digit dates for items 14, 16, 18, 19, and a 6-digit date for item 24a. The same applies to providers and suppliers who choose to submit 6-digit dates. Items 12 and 31 are exempt from this requirement. Paper claims will be returned as unclean if they do not adhere to the date requirements. Electronic claims will be returned that do not include an 8-digit date (ccyymmdd) when a date is reported. Items marked with \"R\" (Required) or \"C\" (Conditionally Required) will cause your claim to be rejected if they are missing, invalid, or incomplete. However, there are many other items on the claim form, which must be properly completed, or your claim will be developed, delayed or denied. Back of CMS-1500 BECAUSE THIS FORM IS USED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE HEALTH PROGRAMS, SEE SEPARATE INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED BY APPLICABLE PROGRAMS. NOTICE: Any person who knowingly files a statement of claim containing any misrepresentation or any false, incomplete or misleading information may be guilty of a criminal act punishable under law and may be subject to civil penalties. REFERS TO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ONLY MEDICARE AND TRICARE PAYMENTS: A patient's signature requests that payment be made and authorizes release of any information necessary to process the claim and certifies that the information provided in Blocks 1 through 12 is true, accurate and complete. In the case of a Medicare claim, the patient's signature authorizes any entity to release to Medicare medical and nonmedical information, including employment status, and whether the person has employer group health insurance, liability, no-fault, worker's compensation or other insurance, which is responsible to pay for the services for which the Medicare claim is made. See 42CFR 411.24(a). If item 9 is completed, the patient's signature authorizes release of the information to the health plan or agency shown. In Medicare assigned or TRICARE participation cases, the physician agrees to accept the charge determination of the Medicare carrier or TRICARE fiscal intermediary as the full charge and the patient is responsible only for the deductible, coinsurance and noncovered services. Coinsurance and the deductible are based upon the charge determination of the Medicare carrier or TRICARE fiscal intermediary if this is less than the charge submitted. TRICARE is not a health insurance program but makes payment for health benefits provided through certain affiliations with the Uniformed Services. Information on the patient's sponsor should be provided in those items captioned in \"Insured\"; i.e., items 1a, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 11. BLACK LUNG AND FECA CLAIMS The provider agrees to accept the amount paid by the Government as payment in full. See Black Lung and FECA instructions regarding required procedure and diagnosis coding systems. SIGNATURE OF PHYSICIAN OR SUPPLIER (MEDICARE ,TRICARE, FECA AND BLACK LUNG) I certify that the services shown on this form were medically indicated and necessary for the health of the patient and were personally furnished by me or were furnished incident to my professional service by my employee under my immediate personal supervision, except as otherwise expressly permitted by Medicare or TRICARE regulations. For services to be considered as \"incident\" to a physician's professional service, 1) they must be rendered under the physician's immediate personal supervision by his/her employee, 2) they must be an integral, although incidental part of a covered physician's service, 3) they must be of kinds commonly furnished in physician's offices, and 4) the services of nonphysicians must be included on the physician's bills. For TRICARE claims, I further certify that I (or any employee) who rendered services am not an active duty member of the Uniformed Services or a civilian employee of the United States Government or a contract employee of the United States Government, either civilian or military (refer to 5 USC 5536). For Black- Lung claims, I further certify that the services performed were for a Black Lung-related disorder. No Part B Medicare benefits may be paid unless this form is received as required by existing law and regulations (42 CFR 424.32). NOTICE: Any one who misrepresents or falsifies essential information to receive payment from Federal funds requested by this form may upon conviction be subject to fine and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 7 of 103 NOTICE TO PATIENT ABOUT THE COLLECTION AND USE OF MEDICARE, FECA, AND BLACK LUNG INFORMATION (PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT) We are authorized by CMS, TRICARE and OWCP to ask you for information needed in the administration of the Medicare, TRICARE, FECA, and Black Lung programs. Authority to collect information is in section 205(a), 1862, 1872 and 1874 of the Social Security Act as amended, 42 CFR 411.24(a) and 424.5(a) (6), and 44 USC 613; E.O. 9397. The information we obtain to complete claims under these programs is used to identify you and to determine your eligibility. It is also used to decide if the services and supplies you received are covered by these programs and to insure that proper payment is made. The information may also be given to other providers of services, carriers, intermediaries, medical review boards, health plans, and other organizations or Federal agencies, for the effective administration of Federal provisions that require other third parties payers to pay primary to Federal program, and as otherwise necessary to administer these programs. For example, it may be necessary to disclose information about the benefits you have used to a hospital or doctor. Additional disclosures are made through routine uses for information contained in systems of records. FOR MEDICARE CLAIMS: See the notice modifying system No. 09-70-0501, titled, 'Carrier Medicare Claims Record,' published in the Federal Register, Vol. 55 No. 177, page 37549, Wed. Sept. 12, 1990, or as updated and republished. FOR OWCP CLAIMS: Department of Labor, Privacy Act of 1974, \"Republication of Notice of Systems of Records,\" Federal Register Vol. 55 No. 40, Wed Feb. 28, 1990, See ESA-5, ESA-6, ESA-12, ESA-13, ESA-30, TRICARE CLAIMS: PRINCIPLE PURPOSE(S): To evaluate eligibility for medical care provided by civilian sources and to issue payment upon establishment of eligibility and determination that the services/supplies received are authorized by law. ROUTINE USE(S): Information from claims and related documents may be given to the Dept. of Veterans Affairs, the Dept. of Health and Human Services and/or the Dept. of Transportation consistent with their statutory administrative responsibilities under TRICARE/CHAMPVA; to the Dept. of Justice for representation of the Secretary of Defense in civil actions; to the Internal Revenue Service, private collection agencies, and consumer reporting agencies in connection with recoupment claims; and to Congressional Offices in response to inquiries made at the request of the person to whom a record pertains. Appropriate disclosures may be made to other federal, state, local, foreign government agencies, private business entities, and individual providers of care, on matters relating to entitlement, claims adjudication, fraud, program abuse, utilization review, quality assurance, peer review, program integrity, third-party liability, coordination of benefits, and civil and criminal litigation related to the operation of TRICARE. DISCLOSURES: Voluntary; however, failure to provide information will result in delay in payment or may result in denial of claim. With the one exception discussed below, there are no penalties under these programs for refusing to supply information. However, failure to furnish information regarding the medical services rendered or the amount charged would prevent payment of claims under these programs. Failure to furnish any other information, such as name or claim number, would delay payment of the claim. Failure to provide medical information under FECA could be deemed an obstruction. It is mandatory that you tell us if you know that another party is responsible for paying for your treatment. Section 1128B of the Social Security Act and 31 USC 3801-3812 provide penalties for withholding this information. You should be aware that P.L. 100-503, the \"Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988\", permits the government to verify information by way of computer matches. MEDICAID PAYMENTS (PROVIDER CERTIFICATION) I hereby agree to keep such records as are necessary to disclose fully the extent of services provided to individuals under the State's Title XIX plan and to furnish information regarding any payments claimed for providing such services as the State Agency or Dept. of Health and Humans Services may request. I further agree to accept, as payment in full, the amount paid by the Medicaid program for those claims submitted for payment under that program, with the exception of authorized deductible, coinsurance, co-payment or similar cost-sharing charge. SIGNATURE OF PHYSICIAN (OR SUPPLIER): I certify that the services listed above were medically indicated and necessary to the health of this patient and were personally furnished by me or my employee under my personal direction. NOTICE: This is to certify that the foregoing information is true, accurate and complete.

Each Trading Partner has a dedicated folder with a unique user ID and password and the FTP folder is further protected by defining the only IP addresses it will accept files from, even if the user ID and password are correct. The files will remain in the FTP folder until a regularly scheduled job searches the folders for specific file names, downloads the files, and decrypts them. A job to log, load and process the files runs every hour, and the following reports are created, encrypted and uploaded to the appropriate FTP folder at 7:00 p.m. each evening. 1. A TA1 response file denoting receipt of the file is created during the initial logging of the file, but only if the Trading Partner has requested one. This is entirely dependent on the Trading Partners decision. 2. A 997 response file denoting acceptance or rejection of the file is created during the initial logging of the file, but only if the Trading Partner desires one. By default, all Trading Partners are setup to create the 997 response file but the trading partner can set a switch in the EDI file to turn off creation of the 997 response file. This is entirely dependent on the Trading Partners decision. 3. An AB1455 Report file is created at the end of the Log, Load & Process Job. It acknowledges receipt of each individual claim on the EDI file. California State Law requires it sent to Trading Partners within two working days, but our process has it created immediately after the files are processed. 4. Error Reports: a. After the claims are processed, edit errors are worked by the claims staff and claims that cannot be accepted into our system are rejected. The Trading Partner is notified with an 835 remittance response with rejected claims. b. After all edit errors have been worked, the file is closed. An EDTS edit report listing claims that failed edits, with specifics is created. 5. 835 Remittance Response Files are created after the claims go through the adjudication process in the Claims System. When claims are finalized, the response file is created and the results of the adjudication of each claim is sent to the Trading Partner. In all, six separate reports are available to allow Trading Partners who submit electronically to not only confirm receipt of the file, but to confirm the rejection, acceptance, processing and adjudication of each individual claim. Reports 1 & 2 are optional, at the discretion of the Trading Partner; reports 3, 4a, 4b & 5 are generated for Trading Partners who submit electronically, without exception. The files will be encrypted with your PGP public-key and placed in the Sharp FTP folder at 7:00 p.m. each evening. They will be available to you at that time. Samples of each report follow.

This coding system can be used for any setting in which medical services are rendered. The use of diagnostic coding is required for all Medicare claims submitted by physicians. The ICD-10-CM books are updated each year, effective October 1, with a grace period until January 1. Changes to the codes must be made by this date, or the service will be rejected. The official ICD-10-CM can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm ICD-10-CM coding books are available at other publishing companies and technical bookstores. CODING REQUIREMENTS The physician can assist the staff by documenting diagnosis and symptoms in more detail. It is most important for providers to use the most recent version of the ICD-10-CM coding book and to code to the highest level of specificity. Furthermore, make sure that the diagnosis on the claim that which was valid at the time the procedure was performed. Code to the highest degree of specificity and code consistent with the age and sex of the beneficiary. You can reference more than one diagnosis indicator per line of service (see item 24E). SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 76 of 103 CPT PROCEDURE CODE DEFINITION The format of the CPT manual includes descriptions of procedures which are not listed in their entirety for all procedures. The partial description is indented under the main entry and constitutes what is always followed by a semicolon on the main entry. The main entry then encompasses the portion of the description preceding the semicolon, which applies to and is a part of all indented entries which follow with their codes. Example: 70120 Radiologic examination, mastoids; less than three views per side 70130 Complete, minimum of three views per side The common portion of the description is \"radiologic examination, mastoids.\" This description is considered part of both codes. The distinguishing part of each of these codes is that which follows the semicolon. In addition, a code description may define a correct coding relationship where one code is a part of another based on the language used in the descriptor. Some examples of this type of correct coding by code definition are: 1. \"Partial\" and \"complete\" CPT codes are billed . The partial procedure is bundled into the complete procedure. 2. \"Partial\" and \"total\" CPT codes are billed. The partial procedure is bundled into the total procedure. 3. \"Unilateral\" and \"bilateral\" CPT codes are billed . The unilateral procedure is bundled into the bilateral billed. The single procedure is bundled into the multiple procedures. CODING SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL TO A PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE (ADD-ON CODES) The CPT coding system identifies certain codes, which are to be submitted in addition to other codes. Generally, these are identified with the statement \" list separately in addition to code for primary procedure .\" The basis for these CPT codes is to enable providers to separately identify a service that is performed in certain situations as an additional service. Incidental services that are necessary to accomplish the primary procedure (e.g. lysis of adhesions in the course of an open cholecystectomy) are not separately billed. Supplemental codes frequently specify codes or ranges of codes with which they are to be used. It would be inappropriate to use these codes other than those specified. When CPT codes are not identified as supplemental codes, they are not to be billed. Those supplemental codes that are part of a more comprehensive procedure but do not described a separately identifiable service are not appropriate. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 77 of 103 CLAIMS EDITING SYSTEM The clinical editing system in use is based on multiple coding support including: CPT-4, HCPCS, and ICD-10-CM CCI AMA and CMS guidelines and industry standards Medical policy and literature research Input from academic affiliations Specialty society recommendations Every decision is fully supported with a variety of clinical documentation to ensure complete understanding of the system and communication to the provider community. The edits are based on the information provided on the claim. If the claim information is incomplete or invalid, the claim edits will be accurate but may not be the outcome the provider expected. Most edits are reviewed by coding staff before claims are processed. Please make sure additional documentation to justify coding is included on the claim, such as modifiers and information in box 19 of the CMS 1500 or box 84 of the UB04. Any clinical or operative reports should be attached to validate procedures billed with modifier 59, emergency services and unlisted procedures. The additional information will provide the claims examiner with the necessary information to process the claim correctly. GLOBAL SURGICAL PACKAGE The CPT codes that represent a readily identifiable surgical procedure include, on a procedure by procedure basis, a variety of services. In defining the specific services included in a given CPT surgical code, the following services are always included in addition to the operation per se: local infiltration, metacarpal/metatarsal/digital block or topical anesthesia subsequent to the decision for surgery, one related E/M encounter on the date immediately prior to or on the date of procedure (including history and physical); immediate postoperative care, including dictating operative notes, talking with the family and other physicians; writing orders evaluating the patient in the post anesthesia recovery area; typical postoperative care. Follow-up care for therapeutic surgical procedures includes only that care which is usually a part of the surgical service. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 78 of 103 MODIFIERS AND PAYMENT RULES SPLIT GLOBAL, PROFESSIONAL (26) & TECHNICAL COMPONENT (TC) Only certain services include a technical and professional component. Many Fee Schedules includes separate allowances for these services. Certain procedures are a combination of a physician component (professional) and a technical component. When the physician component is reported separately, the service may be identified by adding modifier \"26\" to the usual procedure number. Note: Modifier-26 should not be used if there is a specific code, which already describes only the physician component of a given service. For example, it would be inappropriate to use modifier -26 in conjunction with procedure code 93010 (electrocardiogram, routine ECG with at least 12 leads; interpretation and report only ) because it is 100% professional. Under certain circumstances, a charge may be made for the technical components alone. Adding modifier \"TC\" to the usual procedure number identifies the technical component charge. Modifier-TC should not be used if there is a specific code, which describes a procedure that is 100% technical (having no professional component). Note: It would be inappropriate to use modifier -TC in conjunction with procedure code 93005 (electrocardiogram, routine ECG with at least 12 leads; tracing only without interpretation and report ) because it is 100% technical. MODIFIER 22 - Unusual Procedural Services When the service provided is greater than that which usually required for the listed procedure, it may be identified by adding a modifier 22. Include a report with the claim and document the amount of addition time or circumstances that justify the use of modifier 22. MODIFIER 25: Significant, Separately Identifiable Evaluation Management (E & M) Service by the Same Physician on the Same Day of the Procedure or Other Service A provider may need to indicate that on the day a procedure or service was performed the patient's condition required a significant, separately identifiable E & M service above and beyond the other service provided, or beyond the usual preoperative and postoperative care associated with the procedure that was performed. The E & M service may be prompted by the symptom or condition for which the procedure and/ or service was provided. As such, different diagnoses are not required for reporting of the E & M services on the same day. (This modifier is not used to report an E&M service that resulted in a decision to perform major surgery). The patient's records must contain information to support the use of modifier 25. A 50% reduction in reimbursement will apply for an E/M service (99201-99205 or 99212-99215 with modifier 25) if billed for the same person on the same date of service as a Preventative Medicine Service. Reason: some elements of the practice expense for a preventative visit service is duplicated in the reimbursement for the E/M code. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 79 of 103 Visits by the same physician on the same day as a surgical procedure with 000 or 010 days postoperative or endoscopy procedures that are related to the standard preoperative evaluation or recovery from the procedure are included in the global reimbursement for the procedure. However, if a significant separately identifiable service is performed and is clearly documented in the patient's records, payment can be made for the visit when billed with modifier 25. The documentation for the E/M must include important, weighty, notable, distinct correlation, with signs and symptoms to make a diagnostic classification or demonstrate a distinct problem. The E & M service should be able to stand alone for the new problem found and treated on the same day that a minor surgery or procedure with a global period of zero to ten days. Remember, documenting an evaluation of a problem that does not include documentation that supports what was done about the problem, or the management portion of the service, will be considered incomplete and will be denied. Bill the surgical procedure code(s) above the E&M code with modifier -25 for adjudication accuracy. In order to pay claims timely and accurately supporting documentation must be attached to all claims billed with a modifier 25. For further detail and claim examples of appropriate and inappropriate use of modifier 25 use please refer to : https://med.noridianmedicare.com/web/jeb/topics/modifiers/25 SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 80 of 103 MODIFIER 50: Bilateral Procedure Procedures performed on both sides of the body or body area during the same operative session and on the same day are called bilateral procedures. Procedures which are usually performed as bilateral procedures or the code descriptor specifically states that the procedure is bilateral, should not be reported with bilateral modifiers. Use of modifier 50 indicates that a procedure is bilateral, indicating that the procedure is performed twice during the same operative session. When billing for bilateral services the quantity in the units field should always be one. Bilateral procedures are reimbursed at 150% of the contracted allowable. MODIFIER 51: Multiple Procedures When multiple procedures, other than E/M services, are performed at the same session by the same provider, the primary procedure or service may be reported as listed. The additional procedure(s) or service(s) may be identified by appending the modifier 51 to the additional procedure or service code(s). The payment for procedures billed with a modifier 51 will be reduced to 50% of the contracted allowable. MODIFIER 52: Reduced Services Under certain circumstances a service or procedure is partially reduced or eliminated at the physician's discretion. Under these circumstances the service provided can be identified by its usual procedure number and the addition of modifier 52 signifying that the service is reduced. Procedures with modifier 52 appended will be reduced 50% of the allowable amount. Note: For hospital outpatient reporting of previously scheduled procedure/service that is partially reduced or cancelled as a result of extenuating circumstances or those that threaten the well-being of the patient prior to or after administration of anesthesia, see modifier'73' and '74'. MODIFIER 53: Discontinued Procedure Under certain circumstances such as a serious risk to the patient's well-being, a surgical or diagnostic procedure is terminated at the physician or other health care professional's direction. Under these circumstances the procedure provided should be identified by its usual procedure code and the addition of modifier 53 (discontinued procedure) signifying that the procedure was started but discontinued. This provides a means of reporting the discontinued procedure leaving the identification of the basic service intact. Modifier 53 should be used with surgical codes or medical diagnostic codes, and not with the following: evaluation and management services, elective cancellation of a procedure prior to the patient's anesthesia induction and/or surgical preparation in the operating suite, or when a laparoscopic or endoscopic procedure is converted to an open procedure or when a procedure is changed or converted to a more extensive procedure. Allowance will be 25% of the allowable amount for the primary unmodified procedure. Multiple procedure reductions will still apply. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 81 of 103 MODIFIER 59: Distinct Procedural Service Under certain circumstances, the provider may need to indicate that a procedure or service was distinct or independent from other non E/M services performed on the same day. Modifier 59 is used to identify procedures/services other than E/M services, that are not normally reported together but are appropriate under the circumstances. Documentation must support a different session, different procedure or surgery, different site or organ system, separate incision/excision, separate lesion, or separate injury not ordinarily encounters or performed on the same day by the same individual. However, when another already established modifier is appropriate it should be used rather than modifier 59. Document in Box 19 of the CMS 1500 the explanation for the use of modifier 59 or Box 84 of the UB92. Include medical records such as operative reports if the documentation can support the use of modifier 59. MODIFIER 80: Assistant Surgeon Surgical assistant services are identified by adding the modifier 80 to the procedure. Procedures with a modifer 80 appended will be paid at 16% of the allowable amount. MODIFIER 81: Assistant Surgeon Minimum surgical assistant services are identified by adding the modifier 81 to the usual procedure number. Procedures with a modifier 81 appended will be paid at 10% of the allowed amount. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 82 of 103 ELIGIBILITY RELATED CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE 1371.8 In order for your claim to be valid for payment under California Health and Safety code \u00a7 1371.8, member eligibility and authorization must be confirmed or obtained no more than 2 business days prior to the date the authorized service is to be provided. The provider must retain proof of such authorization in order to qualify for payment should it later be determined that the member was not enrolled or eligibility for payment for the authorized service on the date the service was provider. BALANCE BILLING Balance billing members is prohibited by the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) for both contracted and non contracted providers. All contracted providers have language in their contracts that prohibits balance billing of members. Providers must complete a provider dispute resolution form (PDR) and explain the reason why the provider believes additional payment is due. Providers who balance bill members may have their practices considered an unfair billing pattern subject to fines by the DMHC. DUPLICATE BILLING Approximately, 5 percent of all claims filed are denied as duplicate claims. This is an unnecessary waste of funds and is a problem area targeted for reduction. Whenever possible, Sharp Healthcare will work with providers to eliminate the submission of duplicate claims. Providers submitting the greatest percentage of duplicate claims will be identified and contacted to learn about various alternatives to duplicate filing. There are several reasons you may receive a denial as a duplicate of a claim either already in process, or previously paid. Claims denied as not reasonable or medically indicated cannot be resubmitted with a corrected or changed diagnosis code. Any corrections must be submitted in writing to the Provider Dispute Resolution Department. Automated \"re-billing\" systems that are set to re-bill every 30 or 45 days account for a large number of these problems. Often we receive the same claim several times before someone checks to see what the problem is. Many times the payment from the original claim has gone to the deductible, or the service was denied for medical necessity, eligibility, or other reason. Make sure if you are using an automated system that it accurately posts these types of settlements and provides you with the necessary reports or mechanisms to pursue other avenues of appeal or collection. If a procedure is performed more than once on a given day, utilize ICD-9-CM codes, modifiers, and documentation to identify different sites, sessions or specimens. Use the Sharp IDX Outreach product to determine if the claim has been received and payment has been made or the claim settled in some way, before sending in a duplicate. SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 83 of 103 TRACER CLAIMS Sharp does not recommend submitting claims stamped ,\"Tracer\". Since claims must be acknowledged within 2 or 15 working days depending on type of submission, there is no reason to continue this process. MULTIPLE PAGE CLAIMS Sometimes more than one claim form is required for one patient. When this occurs do not total each claim, total the last page of the CMS 1500 or UB04. Attach multiple pages together so they can be processed as one claim. PROOF OF TIMELY FILING TIPS Claims must be submitted within the time period specified in AB1455 or your contract. The timeframe can not be less than 90 days. If you believe a claim was filed within the contracted period you can attach evidence to the provider dispute unit. The following table will assist you with acceptable forms of proof. Forms of Acceptable Proof: Items to Verify Acceptable Proof: ELECTRONIC Edit report of acceptance by Sharp -Proof must be a copy of the edit report -Submission dates must be included and fall within the filing limits from the date of service (DOS) For EDI claims that could not be processed by Sharp Sharp letter must indicate that the original submission fell within the filing limits PAPER CLAIMS Dated Request for Additional Information form from Sharp Ensure dates are within the filing limitations from DOS to Sharp letter date Confirm that the response to Sharp' request also falls within the filing limits Claim Denial letter or EOB from Sharp Verify member information and dates of service Ensure EOB/Denial Letter date is within the filing limit Denial letter from other insurance carrier, dates and printed on letterhead Letter must have valid letterhead Letter must be dated Claim to Sharp must be made within the filing limits, starting from the date of the letter Dated EOB from other insurance carrier EOB must have date within the filing limits Claim to Sharp must be made within the filing limits, starting from the date of the EOB Proof of member billing Must include complete billing history Follow-up attempts must be made within the timely filing limits 15 Day Acknowledgement Letter Provide the acknowledgement notice as proof of time submission SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 84 of 103 AB1455 TIME LIMITS AND MEASUREMENTS ITEM DESCRIPTION AUTOMATIC PAYMENT OF INTEREST Interest is due within 5 working days of the payment of the claim without the need for any reminder or request by the provider. INTEREST LESS THAN $2.00 In the event that the interest due on an individual late claim payment is less than $2.00 at the time that the claim is paid, the interest for that claim may be paid, along with interest on other such claims, within 10 calendar days of the close of the calendar month in which the claim was paid. INPATIENT SERVICE CLAIMS A payer shall accept separately billable claims for inpatient services on at least a bi-weekly basis.

In the event that the payer is not primary under coordination of benefits, a deadline shall not be imposed for submitting supplemental or coordination of benefits claims to any secondary payer that is less than 90 days from the date of payment or date of contest, denial or notice from the primary payer. CLAIM FORWARDING Claims involving Emergency Services shall be forwarded to the appropriate payer within 10 working days of receipt of the claim. Claims not involving Emergency Services: If the provider that filed the claim is contracted with the plan's capitated provider, the plan has 10 working days of the receipt of the claim to: Send the claimant a notice of denial, with instructions to bill the capitated provider, or Forward the claim to the appropriate capitated provider In all other cases, the plan has 10 working days of the receipt of the claim incorrectly sent to the plan to forward the claim to the appropriate payer. OVERPAYMENTS A payer's written request for reimbursement to the provider for an overpayment of a claim must be made within 365 days of the date of payment. The 365-day time limit shall not apply if the overpayment was caused in whole or in part by fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the provider. If the provider contests the notice of reimbursement of the SRS/Sharp HealthCare Billing and Claim Payment Procedures Page 85 of 103 ITEM DESCRIPTION overpayment of a claim, the provider, within 30 working days of the receipt of the notice of overpayment, shall send a written notice stating the basis upon which the provider believes that the claim was not overpaid. If the provider does not contest the notice of reimbursement, the provider shall reimburse the payer within 30 working days of the receipt by the provider of the notice of overpayment of a claim. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CLAIMS Acknowledgement of claims shall be provided within: 2 working days of the receipt of an electronic claim 15 working days of the receipt of a paper claim TIME FOR REIMBURSEMENT A payer shall reimburse each complete claim, or portion thereof, whether in state or out of state, as soon as practical, but no later than 45 working days after the date of receipt of the complete claim, unless the complete claim or portion thereof is contested or denied.

Claims submitted outside of these time frames maybe denied as untimely. SRS December 2020 89MEDICAL RECORD DOCUMENTATION WHAT IS DOCMENTATION AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? The primary purpose of medical documentation is to ensure that patient treatment is recorded for quality of care and continuity of treatment. Medical record documentation is required to record pertinent facts, findings, and observations about an individual's health history including past and present illnesses, examinations, tests, treatments, and outcomes. The medical record chronologically documents the care of the patient and is an important element contributing to high quality care. The medical record facilitates: The ability of the physician and other health care professionals to evaluate and plan the patient's immediate treatment, and to monitor his/her health care over time; Communication and continuity of care among physicians and other health care professionals involved in the patient's care; Accuracy and timeliness of claims review and payment; Appropriate utilization review and quality of care evaluations; and Collection of data that may be useful for research and education . An appropriately documented medical record can reduce many of the \"hassles\" associated with claims processing and may serve as a legal document to verify the care provided, if necessary. WHAT DO PAYERS WANT AND WHY? Because payers have a contractual obligation to enrollees, they may require reasonable documentation that services are consistent with the insurance coverage provided. They may request information to validate: The site of service; The medical necessity and appropriateness of the diagnostic and/or therapeutic services provided; and/or That services provided have been accurately reported. To be reasonable and necessary, items and services must have been established as safe and effective. That is: Consistent with symptoms or diagnosis of the illness under treatment; Necessary and consistent with generally accepted professional medical standards (i.e., not experimental or investigational); Not furnished primarily for the convenience of the patient, the attending physician, other medical professionals, or family members; and Furnished at the most appropriate level, which can be provided safely and effectively to the patient. Complete records are those that contain all pertinent and essential information related to the patient's status. Each entry must be \"stand-alone\" (i.e., must support the fact that the level of service billed was rendered). Furthermore, these records must substantiate the service performed and indicate the proper treatment plan. DOCUMENTATION TIPS In documenting medical records to support services provided to patients, special emphasis should be placed on assuring that they: Are consistent with the clinical descriptors and definitions contained in CPT; Would be widely accepted by clinicians and minimize any changes in record-keeping practices; and Would be interpreted and applied uniformly by users across the country. The use of non-standardized medical abbreviations is not acceptable. SRS December 2020 90 The principles of documentation listed below are applicable to all types of medical and surgical services in all settings. For Evaluation and Management (E/M) services, the nature and amount of physician work and documentation varies by type of service, place of service and the patient's status. The general principles may be modified to account for these variable circumstances in providing E/M services. 1. The medical record should be complete and legible . 2. The documentation of each patient encounter should include the reason for the encounter and relevant history, physical examination findings and prior diagnostic test results; assessment, clinical impression or diagnosis; plan for care; and date and legible identity of the observer. 3. If not documented, the rationale for ordering diagnostic and other ancillary services should be easily inferred. 4. Past and present diagnoses should be accessible to the treating and/or consulting physician. 5. Appropriate health risk factors should be identified. 6. The patient's progress, response to and changes in treatment, and revision of diagnosis should be documented. 7. The CPT and ICD-9-CM codes reported on the health insurance claim form or billing statement should be supported by the documentation in the medical record. The signature of the person documenting the medical records should always be identifiable (e.g., legible), and the documentation should be authenticated and dated. In some instances, especially during inpatient hospitalization, a sample of the physician's/provider's signature may be requested. This is done to ensure that the requested records are correctly distinguished. A rubber stamp signature on the medical record is not sufficient as evidence of the physician's presence unless initialed by the physician. The rationale for this policy is that the rubber stamp signature does not afford the required degree of assurance of the physician's involvement in the patient's care to qualify as the attending physician. This system affords no security that others will not use the stamp in the absence of the physician. Computerized signatures are, under certain circumstance, acceptable. The payer must be assured that the individual in question has his or her own confidential code or password to generate a computerized signature. The department heads of hospitals, clinic managers, and medical record departments can provide these assurances. These systems are subject to inspection by payer if it is suspected that a security has been broken. Please note: Any reimbursement made for services not substantiated by sufficient documentation are considered an overpayment and must be refunded. SRS December 2020 91 PROVIDER DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS AB 1455 requires a Health Plan and its capitated providers to establish a fast, fair and cost-effective dispute resolution mechanism to process and resolve contracted and non-contracted provider disputes. How to File a Provider Dispute: A Provider Dispute Resolution Form is included in Appendix B of the manual or on the following web site links: Sharp Community Medical Group - www.sharp.com/scmgproviders Sharp Rees-Stealy - www.sharp.com/srsproviders Sharp Health Plan - www.sharp.com/healthplan In order for a provider dispute to be recorded and filed, the dispute must include the following: it must be in writing the provider name the provider contact information the name and ID of the enrollee the date of service and billed amount the claim number on the explanation of benefits/payment clearly identify the disputed item a clear explanation of basis for provider's feeling that the payment, request for overpayment return, request for addition information, contest, denial or adjustment is correct All provider dispute requests submitted without the information outlined above will be returned to the requestor with a letter stating what information is needed before a review can be performed. Failure to submit the above requested documentation in a timely manner will result in processing delays and/or denial of your provider disputes. A provider dispute request should always include sufficient information to determine why you are requesting a review, and why the service should be paid. Medical records for the service in question, as well as any other supporting documentation, should be submitted. To further assist us expediting your request for review, please include the following information with your request: A copy of the claim as originally submitted, including reports or any other attachments. A copy of the corresponding Remittance Advice statement. Any additional information that may support your claim or justify the medical necessity for services. Suggestions for additional documentation include: 1. Operative, consultation, pathology reports (if applicable), x-ray results, etc. 2. Literature from medical journals substantiating the necessity of the services rendered 3. Nurses notes or progress notes. Some common appeal issues are: Medical necessity denials such as \"this many services are not covered for this condition\" or \"this service is not covered for the reported condition\"; SRS December 2020 92Bundled services (i.e., procedures included in a primary procedure); The number or quantity of services billed. Where to send disputes : In order for disputes to be processed timely they must be directed to the appropriate Post Office Box or unit listed below. Failure to direct disputes to the addresses listed below could result in delays to acknowledge and respond to disputes. MAILING ADDRESS Sharp Rees-Stealy P O Box 939035 San Diego, CA 92193 Att: Provider Dispute Resolution Unit Provider Dispute Resolution Timeframes Description Turnaround Time Frame Filing of a provider dispute related to an individual claim, billing dispute, or contractual dispute. 365 days after the most recent action or, in the case of inaction, 365 days after time for contesting or denying claim has expired. For a dispute related to a demonstrable and unfair payment pattern by the plan or the plan's capitated provider. 365 days after the most recent action or, in the case of inaction, 365 days after time for contesting or denying claim has expired Amended Provider Dispute A provider may submit within 30 working days of the date of receipt of a returned provider dispute for purposes of requesting missing information Resolution and issuance or written determination for each provider dispute or amended provider dispute. Resolution and a written determination must be completed with 45 working days after the date of receipt of the provider dispute or the amended provider dispute. Any provider that submits a claim dispute to the plan's capitated provider's dispute resolution mechanism(s) involving an issue of medical necessity or utilization review shall have an unconditional right of appeal for that claim dispute to the plan's dispute resolution process. A provider has the right to submit an appeal for a de novo review and resolution to the Plan for a period of 60 working days from the capitated provider's Date of Determination. Resolution of a provider dispute or amended provider dispute involving a claim which is determined in whole or in part in favor of the provider, shall include the payment of any outstanding monies determined to be due, and all interest and penalties. Payment is due with 5 working days of the issuance of the Written Determination. Accrual of interest and penalties for the payment of these resolved provider disputes shall commence on the day following the expiration of \"Time for Reimbursement\" of the complete claim. SRS December 2020 93 OVERPAYMENTS When it has been determined that an overpayment has been made on a claim, a request for refund for overpayment will be generated. The provider has 30 days to respond to the request. If the request is not responded to in writing and the provider contractually agrees, we will begin recouping the overpaid amount from any payment made under the tax identification number (TIN) from which the overpayment was originally made. Please send correspondence on Overpayments to the address listed on the request for refund. SRS December 2020 94 PUBLICATIONS You can avoid common billing problems and excessive denials of your claims by first obtaining all the \"tools of the trade\". The following publications are recommended for successful claims submission. PHYSICIANS' CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY (CPT) The Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) is a listing of descriptive terms and identifying codes for reporting medical services and procedures performed by physicians and practitioners. It provides a uniform language to accurately describe medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. The CPT book is updated annually. Maintaining a current copy of this publication is very important for submitting accurate claims. Warning: Although a code is published in the CPT it does not mean that all or part of its description is suitable for Medicare billing. The American Medical Association is assisted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and others in developing codes and descriptors for the CPT. HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION COMMON PROCEDURE CODING SYSTEM (HCPCS ) HCPCS is a national uniform coding system for reporting physician and supplier services under the Medicare program. HCPCS is based on the CPT coding system. It is the only procedure coding system acceptable for Medicare billing. The use of other coding systems in the submission of Medicare claims will result in rejection of claims as unclean, or produce claims processing delays and/or denial of services. There are three levels of codes and modifiers: Level I, the highest level, contains numeric codes assigned by the AMA. These codes are listed in the American Medical Association's Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology or CPT. Level II contains physician and non-physician service codes not included in the Level I, such as injections or J-codes. These alphanumeric codes are developed by CMS to cover ambulance, dental, medical and other services, supplies (durable medical equipment, orthotics, prosthetics, etc.), drugs and procedures not found in the CPT. The HCPCS Level II Code book can be purchased from most technical bookstores or medical publishing companies. Level III codes are those assigned by the local Medicare carriers for services that are not found in Level I or Level II. These codes are also alphanumeric and are different for each carrier. These codes are published by the carriers. INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES, TENTH REVISION, CLINICAL MODIFICATION (ICD-10-CM) Medicare requires physicians to include a complete diagnosis code (or codes) on each claim form submitted for payment. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has adopted the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification or ICD-10-CM coding system for this purpose. SRS December 2020 95In reporting ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, physicians will be describing the patient's condition using terminology which includes specific diagnoses as well as symptoms, problems, complaints or other reason for the medical service. The diagnosis on a claim must be reported to the highest level of specificity. Therefore, you must maintain a current ICD-10-CM manual. You may consult the Medicare B Resource / Medicare B-Special Notice for changes; however, we recommend you purchase the manual annually. The ICD-10-CM is updated every year in October.
