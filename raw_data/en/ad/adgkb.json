A cacao ceremony involves drinking a rich, delicious cacao beverage and using the energy from it as a support for our healing work. Cacao contains mood enhancing compounds such as PEA, anandamide & serotonin. In developing a relationship with a plant as a tool or medicine for healing, we connect more deeply with the natural world and the energies available to us. Your Guide Moses is the co-founder of embue cacao and has been working with cacao and leading ceremonies for over a decade. He has been training others to use this medicine for over 5 years and brings a wealth of experience in various inner work modalities, including body-based therapy, awareness practices, rites of passage & group work.
