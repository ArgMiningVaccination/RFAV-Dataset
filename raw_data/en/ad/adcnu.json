PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and overweight and obesity? What is the answer to the question? Moderate evidence from observational studies indicates that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk is associated with lower risk of overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older, particularly if the duration of human milk consumption is 6 months or longer. Insufficient evidence is available to determine t he relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older; the available evidence was inconsistent. Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption prior to the introduction of infant formula and overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older . No evidence is available to determ ine the relationship between the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants and overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older . No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the i ntensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed at the breast vs by bottle in infants fed human milk as their only source of milk and overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older . No evidence is available to determine the relationship between c onsuming human milk or infant formula (i.e., a single substance) vs human milk and infant formula (i.e., both substances, e.g., \"topping up\") during a single feeding session and overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older . Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. How was this question answered? The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Com mittee, Birth to 24 M onths Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. 10 What is the population of interest? The systematic review studied 2 different populations. The first was generally healthy infants and toddlers ( birth to 2 4 months) who were fed human milk and/or infant formula and who had overweight and obesity outcomes examined at 2 years of age or older . The second was generally healthy siblings who were fed differently during infancy or who had different outcomes, or both, and who had rapid weight gain examined between birth and 24 months and/or BMI, body composition, overweight or obesity examined at 2 years of age or older. What evidence was found? This review includes 42 articles. The review examined available evidence about: o Infants who ever consumed milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) compared with infants who never consumed human milk, o Infants who consumed human milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) for different durations, o Infants who consumed human milk exclusively for different durations before infant formula was added to their diets, and o Mixed -fed infants (i.e., consuming both human milk and infant formula, but not com plementary foods and beverages) who consumed different amounts of human milk. o Infants who consumed human milk as their only source of milk and who consumed different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk at the breast versus by bottle, and o Mixed-fed infants who consumed a single substance at a single feeding session (i.e., either human milk or infant formula) with mixed- fed infants who consumed both substances at a single feeding session (e.g., \"topping up\"). These articles examined available evidence related to overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older and, for siblings, about rapid weight gain from birth to 24 months, BMI, and body composition at 2 years of age and older. Most evidence examined overw eight and obesity in infants who ever consumed human milk compared to infants who never consumed human milk, or in infants who consumed human milk for different durations. o Infants who ever consume human milk, and especially infants who consume human milk f or 6 months or longer, may have lower risk of overweight and obesity throughout life than infants who never consume human milk. The findings may be due, in part, to f actors other than infant feeding that also impact overweight and obesity . o It is not clear whether infants who consume human milk for different durations have different risk of overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older. The evidence was inconsistent. There was not a lot of evidence about i nfants who consumed human milk exclusively for different durations before infant formula was added to their diets. There was no evidence about infants who consumed human milk at the breast compared to by bottle, or about mixed- fed infants who consumed different amounts of human milk or who consumed human milk and infant formula during the same feeding session compared to during different feeding sessions. 11 How up -to-date is this systematic review? This review searched for studies published between January 2011 and September 2019 and additional sibling s tudies published between January 1980 and September 2019. 12 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Birth to 24 M onths Subcommittee , conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and overweight and obesity ? Conclusion statement s and grades Ever vs never consuming human milk o Moderate evidence from observational studies indicates that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk is associated with lower risk of overweight and obesity at ages 2 years and older, particularly if the duration of human milk consumption is 6 months or longer. (Grade: Moderate) Duration of any human milk consumpt ion among infants fed human milk o Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and overweight and obesity at ages 2 years and older; the available evidence was inconsistent. (Grade: Grade not assignable) Duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula o Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and overweight and obesity at ages 2 years and older. (Grade: Grade not assignable) Intensit y, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants o No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants and overweight and obesity at ages 2 years and older. (Grade: Grade not assignable) Intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed at the breast vs by bottle in infants fed human milk as their only source of milk o No evidence is available to determine the relationship between the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed at the breast vs by bottle in infants fed human milk as their only source of milk and overweight and obesity at ages 2 years and older. (Grade: Grade not assignable) Consuming human milk or infant formula (i.e. , a single substance) vs human milk and infant formula (i.e., both substances) during a single feeding session o No evidence is available to determine the relationship between consuming human milk or infant formula (i.e., a single substance) vs human milk and infant formula (i.e., both 13 substances, e.g., \"topping up\") during a single feeding session and overweight and obesity at ages 2 years and older . (Grade: Grade not assignable) Methods Two literature searches were conducted to identify articles published from January 1980 to March 2016, and from March 2016 to September 2019. The searches used 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane) . A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by 2 NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on pre- determined criteria. Articles published between 2011 and 2019 were included if they met the pre-determined criteria and examined human milk and infant formula exposures from birth to 24 months and the outcomes of overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older. A dditional articles , published between 1980 and 2011, were included if they met the pre -determined criteria and compared siblings within the same fami ly. Sibling studies are unique because they reduce the risk of bias from confounding from genetic and environmental factors that siblings share. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The Committee q ualitatively synthesized the body of evidence to inform development of a conclusion statement, and graded the strength of evidence using pre- established criteria for risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generaliza bility. Summary of the e vidence This systematic review examined the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and overweight and obesity. Specifically, this systematic review examined available evidence that compared: o Infants who ever consumed milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) with infants who never consumed human milk, o Infants who consumed human milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) for different durations, o Infants who consumed human milk exclusively for different durations before the introduction of infant formula, o Mixed -fed infants (i.e., consuming both human milk and infant formula, but not complementary foods and beverages) who consumed different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk, o Infants who consumed human milk as their only source of milk and who consumed different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk at the breast versus by bottle, and o Mixed -fed infants who consumed a single substance at a single feeding session (i.e., either human milk or infant formula) with mixed- fed infants who consumed both substances at a single feeding session (e.g., \"topping up\"). Human milk refers to mother's own milk provided at the breast (i.e., nursing) or expressed and fed fresh or after refrigeration or freezing. Examinations of donor milk are not included in this review. Exclusive human milk consumption refers to consuming human milk alone and not in combination with infant formula or complementary foods and bever ages. Infant formula refers to commercially prepared infant formula meeting the FDA and/or Codex Alimentarius 14 international food standards. Complementary foods and beverages are foods and beverages other than human milk or infant formula (liquids, semisoli ds, and solids) provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy. The outcomes of interest were overweight and obesity at ages 2 years and older. Available evidence about rapid weight gain from birth to 24 months and BMI and body compos ition at ages 2 years and older were also examined from studies that conducted within- famliy analyses of discordant siblings (i.e., siblings fed differently during infancy, siblings with differences in outcome status, or both). This review identified 42 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Thirty of the 42 articles presented evidence about ever, compared with never, consuming human milk, and 21 of the 42 articles presented evidence about different durations of any human milk consumption (i.e. some arti cles presented evidence about both exposures ). The 30 articles that examined the relationship between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk, and overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older presented evidence from 21 independent cohorts. o The evidence had strong consistency. Fourteen of the 21 studies found significant associations and all of them showed that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk is associated with lower risk of overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older. One study showed a marginal association in the same direction, and some of the remaining studies were underpowered. o The evidence available from 5 of 7 studies that compared infants who consumed human milk for different durations with infants who never consumed human milk suggested that a longer duration of human milk consumption (e.g., 6 months) is most likely to be associated with reduced risk of overweight or obesity, compared to never consuming human milk. o In 4 studies, the investigators conducted wit hin-family analyses of siblings, which are designed to reduce bias due to confounding from genetic and environmental factors (factors that siblings share). Some of these analyses showed an attenuation of the significant associations found in full -sample analyses, suggesting that confounding may explain some of the association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older. o The ability to draw stronger conclusions was primarily limited by the potential for confounding in a body of evidence made up of observational studies, and some concerns about the generalizability of the evidence from the studies conducted outside the United States (because U.S. populations may have higher risk of overweight and obesity than do the populations sampled for the non- U.S. studies). The 21 articles that examined the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older presented evidence from 1 cluster randomized controlled trial and 18 independent cohorts. o The evidence was inconclusive. Nine of the 19 studies reported significant associations, but they were inconsistent in direction. In addition, potential bias from confounding and the limited generalizability of the evidence from the non- U.S. studies raised concerns (in particular because the prevalence of obesity among the participants of the cluster randomized controlled trial , conducted in Belarus, was much lower than the prevalence among youth in the United States). 15 Evidence available from 2 studies was insufficient to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older. No studies were identified that examined the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants, the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed at the breast versus by bottle, or consuming a single substance (i.e., either human milk or infant formula) versus both human milk and infant formula during a single feeding session. 16 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and overweight and obesity ?

(Grade: Grade not assignable) 17 Summary of the evidence This systematic review examine d the relationship between the duration, frequency, and volume of exclusive human milk and/or infant formula consumption and overweight and obesity. Specific ally, this systematic review examined available evidence that compared : o Infants who ever consumed milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) with infants who never consumed human milk, o Infants who consumed human milk (i.e., any amount of human milk) for differe nt durations, o Infants who consumed human milk exclusively for different durations before the introduction of infant formula, o Mixed -fed infants (i.e., consuming both human milk and infant formula, but not complementary foods and beverages) who consumed di fferent intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk, o Infants who consumed human milk as their only source of milk and who consumed different intensities, proportions, or amounts of human milk at the breast versus by bottle, and o Mixed -fed infants who consumed a single substance at a single feeding session (i.e., either human milk or infant formula) with mixed- fed infants who consumed both substances at a single feeding session (e.g., \"topping up\"). Human milk refers to mother's own milk provided at the breast (i.e., nursing) or expressed and fed fresh or after refrigeration or freezing. Examinations of donor milk are not included in this review. Exclusive human milk consumption refers to consuming human milk alone and not in combination with infant for mula or complementary foods and beverages. Infant formula refers to commercially prepared infant formula meeting the FDA and/or Codex Alimentarius international food standards. Complementary foods and beverages are foods and beverages other than human milk or infant formula (liquids, semisolids, and solids) provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy. The outcomes of interest we re overweight and obesity at ages 2 years and older. Available evidence about rapid weight gain from birth to 24 months and BMI and body composition at ages 2 years and older were also examined from studies that conducted within- famliy analyses of discordant siblings (i.e., siblings fed differently during infancy, siblings with differences in outcome status, or both). This review identified 42 articles that met the inclusion criteria. 1-42 Thirty of the 42 articles presented evidence about ever, compared with never, c onsuming human milk, and 21 of the 42 articles presented evidence about different durations of any human milk consumption (i.e. some articles presented evidence about both exposures ). The 30 articles that examined the relationship between ever, compared wi th never, consuming human milk, and overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older presented evidence from 21 independent cohorts. o The evidence had strong consistency. Fourteen of the 21 studies found significant associations and all of them showed t hat ever, compared with never, consuming human milk is associated with lower risk of overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older. One study showed a marginal association in the same direction, and some of the remaining studies were underpowered. o The evidence available from 5 of 7 studies that compared infants who consumed human milk for different durations with infants who never consumed human milk suggested that a 18 longer duration of human milk consumption (e.g., 6 months) is most likely to be ass ociated with reduced risk of overweight or obesity, compared to never consuming human milk. o In 4 studies , the investigators conducted within- family analyses of siblings, which are designed to reduce bias due to confounding from genetic and environmental factors (factors that siblings share). Some of these analyses showed an attenuation of the significant associations found in full -sample analyses, suggesting that confounding may explain some of the association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older. o The ability to draw stronger conclusions was primarily limited by the potential for confounding in a body of evidence made up of observational studies, and some concerns about the generaliz ability of the evidence from the studies conducted outside the United States (because U.S. populations may have higher risk of overweight and obesity than do the populations sampled for the non- U.S. studies).

In addition, potential bias from confounding and the limited generalizability of the evidence from the non- U.S. studies raised concerns (in particular because the prevalence of obesity among the participants of the cluster randomized controlled trial , conducted in Belarus, was much lower than the prevalence among youth in the United States). Evidence available from 2 studies was insufficient to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula and overweight and/or obesity at ages 2 years and older. No studies were identified that examined the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed by mixed- fed infants, the intensity, proportion, or amount of human milk consumed at the breast versus by bottle, or consuming a single substance (i.e., either human milk or infant formula) versus both human milk and infant formula during a single feeding session. Ever, compared with never, consuming human milk Description of the evidence examining the relationship between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and body composition, including obesity, from studies that conducted within -family comparisons of siblings ( Table 1 ) Six articles, published between 2003 and 2019, conducted within- family analyses that compared siblings who ever and never consumed human milk and their B MI or overweight and/or obesity status .3,6,10,14,27,32 These articles presented evidence from 4 independent U .S. cohorts, which are described below. 1. Linked CENTURY Study Hawkins et al14 examined a sample of singleton children from the Linked CENTURY Study in the United States . Participants were from an existing clinical database of well -child visits at Atrius Health in East ern Massachusetts. The authors examined initiation of human milk feeding as a dichotomous variable, which was obtained from hospital records at birth. Height 19 and weight were measured by medical assistants at 2 and 5 years of age. The outcomes of interest w ere BMI z -score as a continuous variable and obesity (i.e., BMI 95 th percentile) as a dichotomous variable (both based on CDC growth curves). The authors conducted analyses in the full sample (N=55,058 at 2 years and 43,893 at 5 years), in a subsample consisting of siblings (N=21,455 at 2 years and 17,083 at 5 years) and in a subsample of siblings with discordant outcomes (N= 2260 at 2 years and 3249 at 5 years). In the full sample, initiating, compared with not initiating, human milk feeding was associated with a significantly lower BMI z-score at 2 and at 5 years of age respectively). In the subsample of families with more than 1 sibling, the associations were nearly identical ( In the subsample of siblings with discordant outcomes, initiating human milk feeding was associated with a significantly lower BMI z- score at 5 years of age ( = -0.07 [95% CI -0.13, -0.01]; the association at 2 years of age was in the same direction but lacked statistical significance ( = -0.04 [95% CI -0.10, 0.03] ). In the full sample, initiating, compared with not initiating, human milk feeding was associated with significantly lower odds of obesity at both 2 and 5 years of age (OR [95% subsample of families with more than 1 sibling, the odds were the same with slightly wider confidence intervals (OR [95% CI] = 0.80 In the subsample of siblings with discordant outcomes, initiating human milk feeding was not significantly associated with obesity at 2 or 5 years of age, and the odds ratios were closer to the null (OR [95% CI] = 0.97 [0.72, 1.32] and 0.94 [0.74, 1.20] , respectively ). 2. Children of the National Longitudinal Survey on Youth 1979 Cohort (Children of NLSY79) Two articles3,6 examined samples of singleton children and adolescents whose mothers were part of the NLSY79 cohort from the United States . Anderson et al (2003)3 examined offspring who were 3 to 11 years of age between 1986 and 1996, whereas Colen and Ramey6 examined offspring who were 4 to 14 years of age between 1986 and 2010 and born after the year 1978. Colen and Ramey6 reported that about 75% of participants were non-Hispan ic white. Both articles examined ever versus never consuming human milk as a dichotomous variable. Infant -feeding data were obtained by maternal report at biannual survey rounds starting in 1986. Both articles used height and weight data, which were meas ured for most participants (i.e., in the article by Anderson et al (2003) ,3 15% of children's height and 22% of children's weight were reported by mothers and in the article by Colen and Ramey ,6 approximately 36% of child and adolescent height and weight data were reported by mothers or participants ). Both articles examined obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth curves) as a dichotomous variable, and Colen and Ramey6 also examined BMI as a continuous variable. Anderson et al (2003)3 conducted analyses on the full sample (N=16,650 observations using a probit model and N=15,050 observations using an instrumental variable model), and on subsamples of siblings measured at the same point in time (mean 5.9 and 9.2 years of age for the younger and older siblings, respectively; N=7919 observations), and at the same age (mean age of 6.6 years; N=4471 observations). In the full sample, children who were ever fed human milk had an approximately 1.8% 20 decrease in the likelihood of being obese relative to children never fed human milk at 3 to 11 years of age ( = -0.018 \u00b1 0.008 and - probit and instrumental variable models, respectively; p- values were not reported, but the instrumental variable model was described as non- signficant). In both sibling subsamples (i.e., with outcomes measured at the same age and at the same time point), being fed human milk was not significantly associated with the likelihood of being obese at 3 to 11 years of age ( 6 conducted analyses on the full sample (N=8237 participants), on a subsample of siblings (N=7319 participants), and on a second subsample of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed differently during infancy; N=1773 participants). In the full sample and sibling subsample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was associated with a significantly lower BMI at 4 to 14 years of age ( In the discordant sibling subsample, the association was in the same direction but was smaller and lacked statistical significance ( = -0.141 \u00b1 0.101). Likewise, in the full sample and sibling subsample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was associated with a significantly lower log odds of obesity at 4 to 14 years of age ( = In the discordant sibling subsample, the association was in the same direction but was s maller and lacked statistical significance ( = -0.173 \u00b1 0.164). 3. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Two articles 10,32 presented evidence from the Add Health study from the United Sta tes. This cohort is a nationally representative sample of 10- to 18 -year-olds in grades 7 to 12 during the 1994- 1995 school year (baseline) . Low-income, African- American, and Hispanic youth were oversampled. Nelson et al32 excluded members of the cohort if they had severe disabilities or pregnancies, were Native Americans, or had graduated from high school, and reported that the sample was 72% non- Hispanic white, 13% non- Hispanic black, 11% Hispanic and 3% Asian. Both articles examined ever versus never consuming human milk as a dichotomous vari able. In addition, Nelson et al 32 examined dichotomous comparisons of participants who were never fed human milk with participants who were fed human milk for different durations (i.e., 3 months, < 3 months, 3- 5.99 months, 6- 8.99 months and 9 months). Infant -feeding data were obtained by parent recall at 10 to 18 years (i .e., baseline). Evenhouse and Reilly 10 examined BMI as a continuous variable and overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85th percentile based on CDC growth curves) and obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth curves) as dichotomous variables at baseline (i.e., 10 to 18 years of age). Nelson et al32 examined BMI z -score (based on CDC growth curves) as a continuous variable and overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85th percentile based on CDC growth curves) as a dichotomous variable at 12 to 21 years of age. Neither of the articles reported the methods for anthropometric data collection. Evenhouse and Reilly10 conducted analyses on the full sample (N=16,903), on a subsample of siblings (N=3773) and on a second subsample of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., sibships in which 1 sibling was ever f ed human milk and the other was never fed human milk; N=576). 21 In the full sample, the sibling subsample, and the discordant sibling subsample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was not significantly associated with BMI at 10 to 18 years of age ( = -sample and analyses) Likewise, in the full sample, the sibling subsample, and the discordant sibling subsample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was not significantly associated with odds of overweight/obesity (OR = for the full -sample analysis) at 10 to 18 years of age. Nelson et al 32 conducted analyses on the full sample stratified by sex (N=5929 males, 6069 females), on a subsample of siblings (N=1700), and on subsamples of siblings with discordant infant feeding and outcomes (i.e., in which the overweight sibling had been fed human milk and the non-overweight sibling had not, and in which the overweight sibling had not been fed human milk and the non-overweight sibling had; N=224 discordant siblings). In the full sample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was associated with significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age in females (OR 0.83 [ 95% CI 0.72, 0.95] ); however, the association in males was closer to the null and nonsignificant (OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.76, 1.05] ). In the subsample of siblings, ever compared with never consuming human milk was also associated with significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age (OR 0.78 [95% CI 0.63, 0.97 ]). The within - family sibling analyses did not suggest any significant associations between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age. In the full sample, there were no significant associations between consuming human milk for durations of <3, 3- 5.99, or 6 -8.99 months , in comparison to never consuming human milk, and odds of overweight/obesity in males or in females at 12 to 21 years of age (OR [95% in females). There was a significant association between consuming human milk for 9 months, compared with never, and odds of overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age in females but not in males (OR [95% CI] 0.78 [0.64, 0.96] and 0.83 [0.67, analyses were not reported for the subsamples of siblings or discordant siblings. In the subsample of siblings, there was a signifi cant association between consuming human milk for 3 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age (OR 0.69 [95% CI 0.54, 0.87]. This analysis was not reported for the full sample or the subsample of discordant siblings. In a subsample of siblings with discordant exposures, there was no significant association between ever compared with never consuming human milk and difference in BMI z -score at 12 to 21 years of age when the lighter sibling was the one fed human milk ( = -0.004 \u00b1 0.11) or when the heavier sibling human milk ( =- 0.09 \u00b1 0.11 ). This analysis was not reported for the full sample or the subsample of siblings. 4. Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (CDS) Metzger and McDade 27 examined a sample of children from the CDS in the United States . The sample consisted of children born between 1984 and 1993 with complete data on both infant feeding and BMI. The authors examined ever versus never consuming human milk as 22 a dichotomous variable, which was obtained by recall from the primary caregiver when participants were between 4 and 13 years of age. Height and weight data were collected by study staff, but the specific methods were not reported. The outcomes of interest were BMI z - score as a continuous variable, and BMI considered as 2 separate dichotomous variables (1) 50 th percentile as a cut -off and (2) overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85th percentile based on CDC growth curves). The authors conducted analyses in the full sample at 9 to 19 years of age (N= 2591) using both an ordinary least squares model and a fixed- effects model, in a sibling sub sample (N=976, including 118 siblings with discordant exposures), and in a subsample of siblings with differences in both feeding and BMI status (N=30 to 44). In the full sample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was significantly associated wi th a 0.150 \u00b1 0.065 (p z -score. In the sibling subsample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was significantly associated with a 0.397 \u00b1 0.176 (p<0.05) unit lower BMI z -score in models, but with a non- significantly 0.152 \u00b1 0.106 unit lower BMI z -score in the ordinary least squares model. In the sub- sample of participants with differences in both feeding and BMI status, ever compared with never consuming human milk was not significantly associated with the odds of having a BMI >50th percentile (OR ~ 1.00 and ~1.30 from fixed effects and ordinary least squares regression models, respectively). In the sub- sample of participants with differences in both feeding and BMI status, ever compared with never consuming human milk was significantly associated with a lower odds of overweight/obesity (OR ~0.60, p <0.01, and ~ 0.40, p<0.05, respectively from fixed ef fects and ordinary least squares regression models ). 23 Table 1.

Four of the 21 studies were also described in the section about evidence from siblings (i.e., Linked CENTURY Study , Children of NLSY79, Add Health , and CDS). A description of the studies is presented below by age group (i.e., 2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, 12 to 19 years , and 20 years and older). Studies with evidence in multiple age groups 1. Generation Rotterdam (Generation R) Study Durmus et al (2011) ,9 Heppe et al ,16 and Durmus et al (2014)8 examined samples of children who participated in the Generation R Study conducted in t he Netherlands. All samples consisted of s ingleton infants who had available information on infant feeding. Heppe et al16 additionally restricted the sample to include only Caucasian infants. Durmus et al (2011)9 examined 2 dichotomous variables: never consuming human milk compared with (1) cons uming human milk for >6 months, and (2) consuming human milk exclusively until 4 months. Heppe et al16 and Durmus et al (2014)8 examined never consuming human milk compared with ever consuming human milk (irrespective of duration) as a dichotomous variable . Infant -feeding data were obtained from clinical delivery reports at birth, and by maternal report at 2, 6 and 12 months of age. The outcome of interest in all 3 studies was overweight and obesity (combined). Durmus et al (2011)9 defined overweight/obesity based on the Dutch growth reference charts (BMI > 1 SDS, corresponding to an approximate adult BMI of >25 kg/ m2) at 2 and 3 years of age (N=5074 at both ages). Heppe et al16 and Durmus et al (2014)8 defined overweight/obesity based on the cut -offs provided by the International Obesity Taskforce (IOTF) at approximately 4 years (N=3610), and 6 years of age (N=5063), respectively. Anthropometric data were measured by trained research staff using standardized protocols. Standing height, rather than recumbent lengths, were measured after 14 months of age. Durmus et al (2011)9 found no significant associations between never consuming human, compared with consuming human milk for >6 months and the odds of overweight/obesity at 2 or at 3 years of age Likewise, the authors found no significant associations between never consuming human milk, compared with consuming human milk exclusively until 4 months of age, and the odds of overweight/obesit y at 2 or at 3 years of age (OR [95% al 16 and Durmus e t al (2014)8 found no significant associations between never consuming human milk compared with ever consuming human milk and t he odds of overweight/obesity at 4 and at 6 years of age et al22 examined a sample of children enrolled in a prospective cohort study conducted in Spai n. The sample included singleton term infants (37 weeks gestational age) born via vaginal delivery at the Hospital General at the University of Valencia. The sample 29 was 100% white Spanish and approximately 70% of the sample were considered appropriate weight for gestational age. The authors compared infants who were fed human milk at birth with infants who were not fed human milk at birth, as reported by the mother at birth. The outcome of interest was obesity (i.e., BMI z -score >2 SD based on the 2007 WHO growth standard) at 5 and 10 years of age (N=145 and 100 and 5 and 10 years of age, respectively). Weight and height data were measured by study staff. Lurbe et al 22 found that ever consuming human milk was associated with a significantly lower relativ e risk of obesity compared with never consuming human milk ( 0.190, p=0.022) at 5 years of age. The association was, however, no longer significant at 10 years of age ( 0.032 , p=0.760). 3. Moschonis et al30 presented analyses conducted on 4 European cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), Etude des D\u00e9ter minants pr\u00e9 et d\u00e9veloppement de l'Enfant (EDEN), EuroPrevall, and Generation XXI, conducted in the United Kingdom , France, Greece, and Portugal, respectively. Infant -feeding data w ere collected by parent report via questionnai re at 6 and 15 months of age in ALSPAC, at 4, 8, and 12 months of age in EDEN, at 15 months of age in Generation XXI, and at 12, 24, and 30 months of age in EuroPrevall. The authors examined never consuming human milk , compared with consuming human milk for 6 months , as a dichotomous variable. Height and weight were measured at each study site and used to identify participants who were overweight and obese (combined, using IOTF cutoffs) at 4 (N=6522), 9 (N=7540), and 13 years of age (N=6124) in the ALSP AC cohort, at 4 years of age in the EuroPrevall (N=309) and Generation XXI (N=3387) cohorts, and at 5 years of age (N=1070) in EDEN cohort. Moschonis et al 30 found no significant associations between never consuming human milk, compared with consuming milk for 6 months , and the odds of overweight /obesity at 4, 9, or 13 years of age (OR ~0.8 , ~1.2, and ~1.1, respectively; CIs not reported ) in ALSPAC, at 4 years of age in EuroPrevall and Generation XXI (OR ~1.5 and ~1.2, respectively; CIs not reported), and at 5 years of age in the EDEN cohort (OR ~1.0 ; CI not reported) . 4. Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) Weng et a l41 and Massion et al26 examined samples of children who participated in the MCS, a nationally representative sample of children born in the United Kingdom between September 2000 and January 2002. C hildre n living in disadvantaged areas and ethnic minor ities were oversampled to adequately represent hard- to-reach populations. Weng et al41 restricted their sample to infants who were singletons born at term. Weng et al41 examined ever (irrespective of duration) compared with never consuming human milk as a dichotomous variable, while Mass ion et al26 examined consuming human milk for >4 months versus never consuming human milk as a dichotomous variable. Infant -feeding data were obtained by parent report at the first interview when infants were between 6 and 12 months of age (mean age of 9.2 months). The outcome of interest was overweight and obesity (combined; defined using IOTF cutoffs) at 3 years of age (N=10 ,810 in the study by Weng et al 41) and 11 years of age ( N=11 ,764 in the study by Massion et al26). Children's heights and weights were measured by trained r esearch staff using standardized protocols. Weng et al41 found a significant association between never consuming human milk , compared with ever consuming human milk , and higher odds of overweight/obesity at 3 years of age (OR 1.25 [ 95% CI 1.09 , 1.42] ). Massion et al26 found a significant association between never consuming human milk , 30 compared with consuming human milk for >4 months , and a higher relative risk of overweight/obesity at 11 years of age ( RR ~1.1 [ 95% CI ~1, ~1.25], p<0.05). 5. Children of the Nation al Longitudinal Survey on Youth 1979 Cohort (Children of NLSY79) Anderson et al (2003) ,3 Colen and Ramey ,6 and Huang et al17 examined samples of children and adolescents whose mothers were part of the National Longitudinal Survey on Youth 1979 Cohort from the United States . Anderson et al (2003)3 examined offspring who were 3 to 11 years of age between 1986 and 1996, Colen and Ramey6 examined offspring who were 4 to 14 years of age between 1986 and 2010 and born after the year 1978, and Huang et al17 examined children who had outcome data at 10 years of age and who had completed at least 8 waves of biannual data collection between 1986 and 2008. Colen and Ramey6 reported that about 75% of participants were non-Hispanic white, and Huang et al17 reported that about 42% were white, 35% were African American and 22% were Latino. All of the articles examined ever versus never consuming human milk as a dichotomous variable. Infant -feeding data were obtained by maternal report at biannual survey rounds starting in 1986. All of the articles used height and weight data. In the articles by Anderson et al (2003)3 and Colen and Ramey ,6 height and weight were measured for most participants (i.e., in the article by Anderson et al (2003) , 15% of children's height and 22% of children's weight were reported by mothers; in the article by Colen and Ramey , approximately 36% of child and adolescent height and weight data were reported by mothers or participants). In the article by Huang et al,17 height and weight were self-reported. All of the articles examined obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth curves) as a dichotomous variable. Anderson et al (2003)3 conducted analyses on the full sample (N=16,650 observations using a probit model and N=15,050 observations using an instrumental variable model), and on subsamples of siblings measured at the same point in time (mean 5.9 and 9.2 years of age for the younger and older siblings, respectively; N=7919 observations), and at the same age (mean age of 6.6 years; N=4471 observations). In the full sample, children who were ever fed human milk had an approximately 1.8% decrease in the likelihood of being obese relative to children never fed human milk at 3 to 11 years of age ( = -0.018 \u00b1 0.008 and - 0.016 instrumental variable models, respect ively; p-values were not reported, but the instrumental variable model was described as non- signficant). In both sibling subsamples (i.e., with outcomes measured at the same age and at the same time point), being fed human milk was not significantly assoc iated with the likelihood of being obese at 3 to 11 years of age ( conducted analyses on the full sample (N=8237 participants), on a subsample of siblings (N=7319 participants), and on a second subsample of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed differently during infancy; N=1773 participants). In the full sample and sibling subsample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was associated with a significantly lower log odds of obesity at 4 to 14 years of age ( = In the discordant sibling subsample, the association was in the same direction but was smaller and lacked statistical significance ( = -0.173 \u00b1 0.164) . 31 Huang et al17 conducted analyses on the full sample (N=5156) . Huang et al17 found that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk was associated with significantly lower odds of obesity at 10 years (OR: 0.79, p<0.05; CI not reported) . 6. Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) cohort Ruijsbroek et al37 and Pluyman et al36 examined samples of children that participated in the PIAMA study from the Netherlands , which was a birth cohort study and prospective follow -up of (1) participants in an intervention study of mite- impermeable mattress and pillow cover s, and (2) participants in a natural -history study in which no intervention was applied. The sample for the intervention arm of the study consisted of children of allergic mothers (mothers with at least 1 of the following: asthma ever, pet allergy, house dust mite allergy or nasal allergy such as hay fever). The sample for the natural -history study consisted of children born to both allergic and non- allergi c mothers. Ruijsbroek et al 37 exam ined never consuming human milk , compared with consuming human milk for >16 weeks , as a dichotomous variable. Pluyman et al36 examined consuming human milk (irrespective of duration) and consuming human milk for 3 different durations (<3 months, 3 to <6 months and 6 months ) compared to never consuming human milk. Infant -feeding data were collected prospectively by parental report at 3 months of infant age. In the article by Ruijsbroek et al ,37 the outcomes of interest were overweight and obesity ( combined) and obesity, defined using IOTF cut-offs, at 3 to 8 years of age (N=3963). From 3 to 8 years of age, anthropometric data were collected via parental recall (based on doctor or nurse report if measured within the last 3 months, or measured by parents), but specific methods were not reported. In the article by Pluyman et al , 36 the outcome of interest was overweight and obesity (combined), defined using the IOTF cutoff, at 12 years of age ( N=2787). At 12 years of age, height and weight were measured by study staff. Ruijsbroek et al37 found no significant associations between never consuming human milk, compared with consuming human milk for > 16 weeks , and the odds of overweight/obesity or obesity at 3 to 8 years of age (OR [95% CI] 1.08 [0.91, 1.29] and 1.44 [0.95, 2.18] , respectively); however the wide confidence interval around the odds ratio for obesity may indicate an insufficient sample size to detect the outcome. In contrast, Pluyman et al ,36 found that ever consuming human milk (irrespective of duration), compared with never consuming human milk, was significantly associated with lower odds of overweight/obesity at 12 years of age (OR 0.61 [95% CI 0.38, 0.97]). When the authors divided the group ever fed human milk into 3 categories of duration (i.e., <3 months, 3 -<6 months, 6 mo nths) , the odds ratios were similar, but the confidence intervals were wider so the associations lacked statistical significance (OR National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Evenhouse and Reilly , 10 Bohr et al ,5 and Nelson et al32 presented evidence from the Add Health study from the U nited States . This cohort is a nationally representative sample of 10- to 18- year-olds in grades 7 to 12 during the 1994- 1995 school year (baseline) . Low-income, African -American, and Hispanic youth were oversampled. Nelson et al32 excluded members of the cohort if they had severe disabilities or pregnancies, were Native Americans, or had graduated from high school, and reported that the sample was 72% non- Hispanic white, 13% non-Hispanic black, 11% Hispanic and 3% Asian. All 3 articles examined ever versus never consuming human milk as a dichotomous variable. 32 In addition, Nelson et al32 examined dichotomous comparisons of participants who were never fed human milk with participants who were fed human milk for different durations (i.e., 3 months, < 3 months, 3- 5.99 months, 6- 8.99 months and 9 months). Infant -feeding data were obtained by parent recall at 10 to 18 years (i.e., baseline). The articles looked at outcomes at baseline (i.e., 10 to 18 years), 2 years later (i.e., 12 to 21 years), and 14 years later (i.e., 24 to 33 years). Evenhouse and Reilly 10 examined overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85th percentile based on CDC growth curves) and obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth curves) as dichotomous variables at 10 to 18 years of age. Nelson et al32 examined overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85th percentil e based on CDC growth curves) as a dichotomous variable at 12 to 21 years of age. Bohr et al5 examined obesity (i.e., BMI 30 kg/ m2) as a dichotomous variable when members of the cohort were 24 to 33 years of age. None of the articl es reported the methods for anthropometric data collection. Evenhouse and Reilly10 conducted analyses on the full sample (N=16,903), on a subsample of siblings (N=3773) and on a second subsample of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., sibships in which 1 sibling was ever fed human milk and the other was never fed human milk; N=576). In the full sample, the sibling subsample, and the discordant sibling subsample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was not significantly associated with odds of overweight/obesity (OR = for the full -sample analysis) at 10 to 18 years of age. Nelson et al 32 conducted analyses on the full sample stratified by sex (N=5929 males, 6069 females), on a subsample of siblings (N=1700), and on subsampl es of siblings with discordant infant feeding and outcomes (i.e., in which the overweight sibling had been fed human milk and the non- overweight sibling had not, and in which the overweight sibling had not been fed human milk and the non- overweight sibling had; N=224 discordant siblings). In the full sample, ever compared with never consuming human milk was associated with significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age in females (OR 0.83 [ 95% CI 0.72, 0.95] ); however, the associat ion in males was closer to the null and nonsignificant (OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.76, 1.05] ). In the subsample of siblings, ever compared with never consuming human milk was also associated with significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age (OR 0.78 [95% CI 0.63, 0.97 ]). The within - family sibling analyses did not suggest any significant associations between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age. In the full sample, there were no significant associations between consuming human milk for durations of <3, 3- 5.99, or 6 -8.99, in comparison to never consuming human milk, and odds of overweight/obesity in males or in females at 12 to 21 years of age (OR [95% in females). There was a significant association between consuming human milk for 9 months, compared with never, and odds of overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age in females but not in males (OR [95% CI] 0.78 [0.64, 0.96] and 0.83 [0.67, analyses were not reported for the subsamples of siblings or discordant siblings. In the subsample of si blings, there was a significant association between consuming 33 human milk for 3 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 12 to 21 years of age (OR 0.69 [95% CI 0.54, 0.87]. This analysis was not reported for the full sample or the subsample of discordant siblings. Bohr et al5 conducted analyses in an unrelated sample (N=4648) and a sibling pair sample (N=1179). In the unrelated sample, the odds of being obese at 24 to 33 years were significantly lower in those ever compared with never fed human milk (OR [95% CI] 0.854 [0.75, 0.97], p=0.018). In the sibling pair sample, the direction and magnitude of effect was the same, but the association was not significant (0.854 [0.64, 1.13] , p=0.277) . 8. Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (CDS) Metzger and McDade27 examined a sample of children from the U .S.-based CDS. The sample consisted of children born between 1984 and 1993 with complete data on both infant feeding and BMI. The authors examined ever versus never consuming human milk as a dichotomous variable, which was obtained by recall from the primary caregiver w hen participants were between 4 and 13 years of age. Height and weight data were collected by study staff, but the specific methods were not reported. The outcome of interest was BMI considered as 2 separate dichotomous variables (1) 50 th percentile as a c ut-off and (2) overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85th percentile based on CDC growth curves). The authors conducted analyses in the full sample at 9 to 19 years of age (N= 2591) using both an ordinary least squares model and a fixed- effects model, in a sibling subsample (N=976, including 118 siblings with discordant exposures), and in a subsample off siblings with differences in both feeding and BMI status (N=30 to 44). In the sub- sample of participants with differences in both feeding and BMI status, ever compared with never consuming human milk was not significantly associated with the odds of having a BMI >50 th percentile (OR ~ 1.00 and ~1.30 from fixed effects and ordinary least squares regression models, respectively). In the sub- sample of participants with differences in both feeding and BMI status, ever compared with never consuming human milk was significantly associated with a lower odds of overweight/obesity (OR ~0.60 (p <0.01) and ~ 0.40 (p<0.05), respectively from fixed effects and ordinary least squares regression models, respectively). Studies with evidence from 2 to 5 years of age 9. Growing Up in Scotland (GUS) Abraham et al1 examined data from the U .K.-based prospective cohort study GUS, which had a representative sample of Scottish infants from 130 geographically clustered areas across Scotland. Infants were born between June 2004 and May 2005 and were selected at random from child benefit records. The authors examined ever consuming human milk (irrespective of duration) compared to never consuming human milk. Infant -feeding data were reported by the primary caregiver ( typically mothers) when the child was between 9 and 12 months of age. The outcome of interest was overweight/obesity ( combined) at 45- 48 months of age (i.e., BMI z -score 1.04 based on the 1990 U .K. growth reference curves; N=3515). Height a nd weight were measured by study staff, but specific methods were not reported. Abraham et al1 found a nonsignificant association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 45- 48 months (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.64,1.01] ). 34 Anderson et al (2003)3: See number 5, above 10. Anderson et al (2014)2 examined data from a cohort of infants born between 2005 and 2009 who participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in Hawaii, United States . The majority of the participants were of Native Hawaiian (62%) and Asian (25%) ancestry . The authors examined dichotomous comparisons of infants who consu med human milk for <1 month (N=3769), 1- 2 months (N=4864), 3- 5 months (N=3119), or 6 months (N=2192) with infants who never consumed human milk (N=1197). Infant -feeding data were collected from mothers by WIC staff. The outcome of interest was overweight and obesity (combined; i.e., BMI 85 th percentile based on CDC growth curves) at 2 years of age. Height and weight were measured by WIC staff, but the methods used were not reported. There was a significant association bet ween consuming human milk for 6 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and a lower prevalence ratio of overweight/obesity at 2 years of age (prevalence ratio 0.82 [ 95% CI 0.72, 0.94] , p<0.05). The associations between consuming shorter durations of human milk (i.e., <1, 1 -2, and 3-5 months) , compared with never consuming human milk, and the odds of overweight and obesity at 2 years of age were closer to the null and nonsignificant above et al (2011)9: See number 1, above 11. Feldman- Winter et al11 examined a cohort of infants born in an urban B aby Friendly hospital in the United States that primarily served racial and ethnic minority groups and families with a low SES. Participants were singletons, born adequate weight for gestational age, about 70% Hispanic, 20% black, and 5% white, and about 85% were WIC participants. The authors compared infants who consumed infant formula exclusively for the first week of life (N=12) with infants who consumed human milk exclusively for the first week of life (N=71). Infant - feeding data were collected from post-delivery medical records and from maternal report during a home visit when infants were 7 days old. The outcome of interest was overweight and obesity (combined; i.e., BMI 85th percentile based on WHO growth curves) at 2 years of age. The authors found no significant association between consuming infant formula exclusively for the first week of life, compared with consuming human milk exclusively for the first week of life, and odds of overweight/ obesity at 2 years of life ( OR 0.7 [95% CI 0.1, 7.0], p=0.79) . The study was underpowered, because at t his Baby -Friendly hospital, there were few infants who were exclusively fed infant formula. 12. Linked CENTURY Study Hawkins et al 14 examined a sample of singleton children from the U .S.-based Linked CENTURY Study . Participants were from an existing clinical database of well -child visits at Atrius Healt h in Eastern Massachusetts. The authors examined initiation of human milk feeding as a dichotomous variable, which was obtained from hospital records at birth. Height and weight were measured by medical assistants at 2 and 5 years of age. The outcome of interest was obesity (i.e., BMI 95 th percentile based on CDC growth curves) as a dichotomous variable. The authors conducted analyses in the full sample (N=55,058 at 2 years and 43,893 at 5 years), in a subsample consisting of siblings (N=21,455 at 2 years and 17,083 at 5 years) and in a subsample of siblings with discordant outcomes (N= 2260 at 2 years and 3249 at 5 years). 35 In the full sample, initiating, compared with not initiating, human milk feeding was associated with significantly lower odds of obesit y at both 2 and 5 years of age (OR [95% subsample of families with more than 1 sibling, the odds were the same with slightly wider confidence intervals (OR [95% CI] = 0.80 In the subsample of siblings with discordant outcomes, initiating human milk feeding was not significantly associated with obesity at 2 or 5 years of age, and the odds ratios were closer to the null (OR [95% CI] = 0.97 13. Layte et al19 presented evidence fr om a nationally representative sample of infants in Ireland who were 9 months old in 2008- 2009. Participants were predominantly of Irish nationality (86%). The authors compared infants who consumed human milk for <3 months (N=386) , <6 months (N=543) , and 6 months (N=870) with infants who nev er consumed human milk (N=4743) . Authors did not indicate whether the <6 month variable included or excluded infants fed human milk <3 months. Infant -feeding data were collected by maternal reports via interview at 9 months. Study staff measured participant height and weight at 3 years of age, which were used to identify participants who were obese using the IOTF threshold. Layte et al19 found a significant association between consuming human milk for 6 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of obesity at 3 years of age ( OR 0.51, p<0.001; CI not reported ). The associations between consuming human milk for shorter durations (i.e., <3 and <6 months), compared with never consuming human milk, were closer to the null and nonsignificant ( OR 0.96, p=0.79 and 0.97, p=0.87, respectively; CIs not reported). 14. Lee et al 20 retrospectively examined a cohort of 38,049 infants born in Korea in 2008 who had completed 7 routine medical check -ups at 4 to 6, 9 to 12, 18 to 24, 30 to 36, 42 to 48, 54 to 60, and 66 to 72 months of age. The authors compared infants who were mixed -fed from birth to 4- 6 months and infants who consumed human milk exclusively from birth to 4- 6 months with infants who consumed infant formula exclusively from birth to 4- 6 months. Infant -feeding data were reported by parents during the 4- 6 month medical check -up and extracted from the National Health Insurance Service database. The outc ome of interest was overweight/ obesity (combined; i.e., BMI >90th percentile based on the Korean National Growth Charts) at 30 -36, 42- 48, 54- 60, and 66- 72 months of age. Height and weight were measured during the medical check -ups. The authors stratified the analyses by birthweight category (i.e., normal birth weight, high birthweight). In the high- birthweight subsample, there were significant associations between being mixed -fed from birth to 4 to 6 months, compared with being exclusiv ely formula fed from birth to 4 to 6 months, and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 30- 36 months and 42- 48 association at 54- 60 months was in the same direction but was slightly attenuated and lacked statist ical significance (OR 0.75 [95% CI 0.54, 1.03]). The association at 66 to 72 months was close to the null (OR 1.02 [ 95% CI 0.72, 1.45]). In the normal -birthweight subsample, there were no significant associations between being mixed- fed from birth to 4 to 6 months, compared with being exclusiv ely formula fed from birth to 4 to 6 months, and the odds of overweight/obesity at 30- 36, 42- 48, 54- 60, or 66-72 months of the high- birthweight subsample, there were significant associations between being fed 36 human milk exclusively from birth to 4- 6 months, compared with being fed infant formula exclusively from birth to 4- 6 months, and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 30- 36 and 54-60 months of age ( 0.90], respectively). The association at 42- 48 months was in the same direction but the confidence interval included the null (OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.58, 1.00]. The association at 66- 72 months was in the opposite direction, but was nonsignificant (OR 1.24 [95% CI 0.92, 1.66]. In the normal -birthweight subsample, there were significant associations between being fed human milk exclusively from birth to 4 -6 months, compared with being fed infant formula exclusively from birth to 4- 6 months, and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 30- 36, 42- 48, 54- 60, and 66- 72 months Longitudinal Study -Birth (ECLS- B) Li et al21 and Moss and Yeaton31 examined samples from the ECLS -B cohort from the United States . Participants were a nationally represent ative sample born in the United States in 2001 to mothers who were at least 15 or 16 years of age, respectively.21,31 Moss and Yeaton31 restricted the sample to participants with a birthweight 1500g. Li et al21 reported that 42% of participants were non- Hispanic white, 16% were non- Hispanic black , 20% were Hispanic, 11% were As ian, and 11% had other racial/ethnic backgrounds ; Moss and Yeaton31 did not report similar inf ormation. Both articles examined ever consuming human milk, compared with never consuming human milk , as a dichotomous variable. Moss and Yeaton31 secondarily stratified infants by their timing of introduction to complementary foods. Infant -feeding data were collected by maternal interview at 9 months and 4 years . Li et al21 assessed obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth curves ) at 4 years (N=8150) . Moss and Yeaton31 assessed obesity as well as overweight (i.e., BMI 85th -94th percentile based on CDC growth curves) and healthy weight (i.e., BMI <85th percentile based on CDC growth curves, including underweight infants) at 2 years (t otal analytic N=7200) and 4 years (total analytic N=6950). Height and weight were measured by trained research staff. Li et al21 found that ever consuming human milk , compared with never consuming human milk, was associated with significantly lower odds of obesity at 2 years of age (OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.63, 0.92]) . Likewise, Moss and Yeaton31 found that ever consuming human milk, compared with never consuming human milk, was associated with significantly lower odds of obesity (compared with overweight) at 2 and at 4 years of age (OR The associations with normal weight (compared with overweight) at 2 and at 4 years were closer to the null and nonsignificant (OR [95% CI] 1.08 [0.89, 1.31] and 0.94 [0.75, 1.18] respectively ). In secondary analyses that incorporated the timing of participants' introduction to complementary foods: o When all infants were introduced to complementary foods <4 months , there was a significant association between ever consuming human milk , compared with never consuming human milk , and lower odds of obesity (compared with healthy weight) at 2 years of age (OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.47, 0.86] , p<0.01) . However the association with obesity at 4 years of age was slightly attenuated and nonsignificant p<0.10) . The associations with overweight (compared with healthy weight) at 2 and at 4 years were nonsignificant (OR [95% CI] 0.89 [0.62, 1.29] and 0.91 [0.62, 1.34] respectively). 37 o When infants ever fed human milk were introduced to complementary foods at 4- 5 months and infants never fed human milk were introduced to complementary foods at <4 months, there were significant associations between ever consuming human milk , compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of obesi ty (compared with health weight) at 2 and at 4 years of age (OR [95% respectively). The associations with overweight (compared with healthy weight) at 2 and at 4 years were nonsignificant o Likewise, when infants ever fed human milk were introduced to complementary foods at 6 months and infants never fed human milk were introduced to complementary foods at <4 months, there were significant associations between ever consuming human milk , compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of obesity (compared with health weight) at 2 and at 4 years of age (OR The associations with overweight (compared with healthy weight) at 2 and at 4 years were nonsignificant above Moschonis et al30: See number 3, above Moss and Yeaton31: See number 15 , above 16. First Baby Study (FBS) Pattison et al35 conducted a secondary analysis of a sample of children enrolled in the FBS in the U nited States . Children included in the analyses were first -born, primarily white (approximately 84% of sample) and had available data on human milk consumption. The authors compared ever consuming human milk (irrespective of duration) , as well as consuming human milk for 2 differ ent durations (0- 6 months and < 6 months) with never consuming human milk. Infant -feeding data were collected prospectively via maternal interviews at 1, 6, and 12 months of age. The outcomes of interest were overweight/obesity (combined; i.e., BMI 85th percentile using obesity i.e., BMI 95th percentile using CDC growth curves ) at 36 months of age (N=1626, 867, and 870 for analyses comparing ever, 0- 6 months, and > 6 months with never consuming human milk, respectively ). Height and weight were measured and reported by mothers. Pattison et al35 found that ever consuming human milk was associated with a significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 36 months compared with never consuming human milk (OR [95% CI] 0. 63 [0.41, 0.96] ). Likewise, the authors found that consuming human milk for > 6 months was associated with a significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 36 months of age compared with never consuming human milk (OR 0.54 [ 95% CI 0.34, 0.85] ). The association between consuming human milk for 0 -6 months and the odds of overweight/obesity was in the same direction and of similar magnitude, but was not statistically significant (OR 0 .68 [95% CI 0.44, 1.05] ). Ever consuming human milk (irrespective of duration), consuming human milk for 0 -6 months , and consuming human milk for >6 months were all significantly associated with a lower odds of obesity at 36 months compared to never consuming human milk (OR [95% CI] et al39 examined first-born children from low -income fami lies enrolled in the Nurse- 38 Family Partnership in the United States between 2007 and 2010. The authors examined dichotomous comparisons of infants who consumed human milk for 1- 3, 4-8, 8-12, or >20 weeks with infants who never consumed human milk. Infant -feeding data were collected by parent report. The outcome of interest was high weight -for-length (WFL) status (i.e., WFL 97.7th percentile based on the WHO growth curves) at 24 months of age (N=6,383). Length and weight were measured by N urse- Family Partnership staff during home visits using NHANES guidelines . There was a significant associati on between consuming human milk for >20 weeks, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of high WFL status at 24 months of age (OR 0.60 [ 95% CI 0.41, 0.88], p <0.05). The associations between shorter durations of human milk consumption (i.e., 1 -3, 4-8, and 8- 20 weeks), compared with never consuming human milk, and high WFL status at 24 months of age were in the same direction but were attenuated Project Viva van Rossem et al 40 presented evidence from Project Viva , conducted in the U nited States . Participants were born 34 weeks gestational age, and had mothers who attended a prenatal visit at 1 of 8 affiliated medical offices in eastern Massachusetts between 1999- 2002. Participants were predominantly Caucasian (74%) from highly educated families. The authors examined dichotomous comparisons of infants who (a) consumed human milk for <6 months, (b) consumed human milk for 6 months, and (c) consumed human milk exclusively for 6 months with infants who never consumed human milk. Infant -feeding data were collected from maternal interview at 6 months . The outcome of interest was obesity (i.e., BMI 95 th percentile based on CDC growth curves) at 3 years of age (N=713). Height and weight were measured by trained research staff using standardized protocols . The authors used analyses without and with adjustment for change in weight -for-age z -score from birth to 6 months, in order to determine the mediating effects of infant weight gain. In the analyses that did not control for infant weight gain, t here was a significant association between consuming human milk exclusively for 6 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of obesity at 3 years of age (OR 0.21 [ 95% CI 0.07, 0.68]). C onsuming human milk non -exclusively for <6 or 6 months, compared with never consuming human milk were not significantly associated with the odds of obesity at 3 years ; the odds were closer to the null (OR In the analyses that did control for infant weight gain, there were no significant associations between consuming any human milk for <6 or 6 months or consuming human milk exclusively for 6 months and the odds of obesit y at 3 years of age al 41: See number 4, above Studies with evidence from 6 to 11 years of age Anderson et al (2003)3: See number 5, above 19. Bjertnaes et al4 examined a sample of children enrolled in a prospective cohort study conducted in Norway. Children included in the cohort started school in Oppland County, a predominantly rural county, in 2007. The authors examined consuming human milk 39 (irrespective of duration), compared to never consuming human milk, as a dichotomous variable. Infant -feeding data were recalled by parents at routine school entry health assessments when children were 5- 6 years of age. The outcome of interest was overweight/obesity (combined ) at approximately 8 years of age (N=951) using BMI cut- offs provided by the IOTF. Height and weight were measured by school nurses, but specific methods were not reported. Bjertnaes et al4 found no significant association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and the odds of over weight/obesity at 8 years of age (OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.48, 2.02], p=0.97) Colen and Long- Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (LCPUFA) Study de Jong et al7 conducted a randomized controlled trial, the Groningen LCPUFA Study , in the Netherlands of infants born between 37 and 42 weeks of gestational age. Infants whose mothers chose to formula feed were randomly assigned to receive either a control formula from birth to 6 months of age, or an AA - and DHA- supplemented formula from birth to 3 months of age followed by a control formula from 3 to 6 months of age. A human milk -fed reference group was also enrolled in the study , and infants in the reference group were given AA- and DHA -supplemented formula until 3 mo of age, and control formula from 3 to 6 mo of age if human milk feeding stopped < 2 months . The authors compared the reference group fed human milk with each of the randomized formula- fed groups . Mothers reported infant - feeding data prospectively in daily diaries until 8 months of infant age. The outcome of interest was overweight/obesity (combined; defined using IOTF BMI cut -offs) at 9 years of age ( N=218 -250). Height and weight were measured by study staff using standardized protocols. de Jong et al 7 found no significant associations between a nonrandomized group ever fed human milk and randomized groups fed either a standard infant formula or an AA- and DHA- supplemented infant formula, and the risk of overweight /obesity at 9 years (data NR). Durmus et al (2014)8: See number 1, above Evenhouse and Reilly10: See number 7, above 21. Growing Right onto Wellness (GROW) Heerman et al15 examined a prospective cohort from the GROW study conducted in the United States . Participants were from low -income families (e.g., 100% qualified for services for underserved populations such as Medicaid or WIC, 43% were food insecure), mostly Hispanic (i.e., 63% Hispanic Mexican, 28% Hispanic non- Mexican, 9% non- Hispanic), and considered to be at high risk for developing obes ity at baseline when they were 3 to 5 years of age (i.e., BMI 50 th and <95th percentile based on CDC growth curves). Infant -feeding data were collected by parent recall at baseline, and the authors examined a dichotomous comparison of human milk consumpti on for 6 months compared to never consuming human milk. Trained study staff measured height and weight. The outcome of interest was obesity (i.e., BMI 95 th percentile based on CDC growth curves) when participants were a mean of about 7 years of age (N=356) . In this high- risk cohort, consuming human milk for 6 months , compared with never consuming human milk , was not significantly associated with the odds of obesity at approximately 7 years of age (OR 0.88 [ 95% CI 0.48, 1.60] ). 40 et al22: See number above et number above and number above et number 3, above Ruijsbroek et al37: See number 6, above Studies with evidence from 12 to 19 years of age Colen and Ramey6: See number 5, above Evenhouse and number above and number 8, above Moschonis et al30: See number 3, above Nelson et al32: See number 7, above Pluyman et al36: See number 6, above Studies with evidence at 20 years of age or later Bohr et al5: See number 7 , above Nelson et al32: See number 7, above Synthesis and assessmentii of the evidence examining the relationship between ever, compared wit h never, consuming human milk and overweight and/or obesity at 2 years of age and older ( Table 2 ) Thirty articles presented evidence from 21 independent studies about the relationship between ever, compared with never , consuming human milk and overweight and/or obesity at 2 years of age and older .1-11,14- 17,19- 22,26,27,30- 32,35- 37,39- 41 A synthesis and assessment of the evidence follows. Consistency: The evidence had strong consistency. Fourteen of the 21 studies ( 18 of 30 articles) found significant associations between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and overweight and/or obesity .2,5,6,14,17,19 - 22,26,27,31,32,35,36,39- 41 The significant associations were consistent in direction. They were all in the direction of ever consuming human milk being associated with lower risk of overweight and/or obesity across a wide range ages from childhood into adulthood: 2 years of age 2,14,31,39 ii A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic -reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020.

One of the 7 studies 1 reported a marginal association between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 45- 48 months (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.64, 1.01]) . The remaining 6 studies may have had insufficient statistical power for some of their analyses, which may account for the lack of statistical significance (see Precision, below). 4,7,9,11,15,30 A closer examination of the evidence from 7 studies (which divided participants into more than 1 group of infants ever fed human milk, based on how long infants consumed human milk, and compared these infants with infants never fed human milk) revealed a trend in the data. Five of the 7 articles found that a longer duration of human milk consumption (e.g., >6 months), compared to never consuming human milk, was significantly associated with lower risk of overweight and/or obesity, but that a shorter duration (e.g., <6 months) was not: Anderson et al (2014) 2 found a significant association bet ween consuming human milk for 6 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and a lower prevalence ratio of overweight/obesity at 2 years of age. However, associations between shorter durations of human milk consumption (i.e., <1, 1 -2, and 3- 5 months ) and overweight/obesity at 2 years of age were not statisitically significant. Layte et al19 found a significant association between consuming human milk for 6 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of obesity at 3 years of age. However, associations between shorter durations of human milk consumption (i.e., <3 and <6 months ) and obesity at 3 years of age were not statistically significant. Pattison et al 35 found significant associations between consuming human milk for >6 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 36 months of age and obesity at 36 months of age, and between consuming human milk for 0- 6 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of obesity at 36 months . However, the association between the shorter duration of 0- 6 months of human milk consumption and overweight/obesity at 36 months was nonsignificant. Thorland et al39 found a significant association between consuming human milk for >20 weeks, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of high weight -for- length status (defined as 97.7th percentile based on WHO growth curves ) at 24 months of 42 age. However, associations between shorter durations of human milk consumption (i.e., 1-3, 4-8, and 8- 20 weeks ) and high weight -for-length status at 24 months of age were not statistically significant . Nelson et al32 found a significant association between consuming human milk for 9 months, compared with never consuming human milk, and lower odds of overweight/obesity at 12- 21 years of age in females ( but not males ). However, associations between shorter durations of human milk consumption (i.e., <3, 3- 5.99, and 6- 8.99 months) and overweight/obesity at 12- 21 years of age were not statistically significant in either sex . The remaining 2 articles did not find a similar trend. Pluyman et al36 reported marginal associations for all durations of human milk consumption that were compared to never consuming human milk (OR of <3, 3- 6, and 6 months, respectively). In the article by van Rossem et al 40, the associations between consuming human milk for <6 and 6 months, compared with never consuming human milk, had wide confidence intervals (i.e., 0.40 to 2.03 and 0.37 to 2.10, respectively), suggesting insufficient statistical power. The evidence from 4 studies was of particular interest because the studies conducted within- family analyses of siblings to reduce confounding from genetic and environmental factors (factors that siblings share) (see Risk of B ias, below). The evidence had some inconsistencies. Metzger and McDade27 reported significant associations from within- family sibling analyses between ever, compared with never, consuming human and lower odds of overweight/ obesity at 9 to 19 years of age. The other 3 studies did not find significant associations from within- family sibling analyses between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and overweight and/or obesity.3,6,10,14,32 Rather, they tended to find that the significant associations found in the full - sample analyses were no longer significant. This may be due, in part , to the much smaller sample size available for the within- family analyses ; however, in 2 articles it was clear that there was an attenuation of the estimated association that had been seen in the full -sample analyses .6,14 These findings suggest that some of the association between ever consuming human milk and lower risk of overweight and/or obesity is explained by confounding. Unfortunately, none of these studies had within- family analyses that compared infants who consumed human milk for different durations with infants who never consumed human milk. Therefore, it is not possible to comment on whether the trend described above (i.e., that longer durations of human milk consumption may be important ) is true for sibling analyses. We also examined BMI (or BMI z -score ) as a continuous variable in 3 studies that had both full-sample and within- family analyses . 6,10,14 The findings were inconsistent. One study did not find significant associations between ever, compared with never, consuming human milk and BMI at 10 to 18 years of age in either analysis . 10 One study found a significant association between ever, compa red with never, consuming human milk and lower BMI at 4 to 14 years of age in the full -sample analysis that was attenuated and nonsignificant in the within -family analysis .6 One study found significant associations between init iating, compared with not initiating, human m ilk feeding and lower BMI z -score at 2 and at 5 years of age in the full sample, and a slight attenuation of the estimated associations in the within- family analyses so that the association at 5 years of age was still statistically significant .14 43 Precision: The evidence had strong precision. The body of evidence had 21 studies, and 14 of them had sufficient statistical power to detect significant associations. Of the remaining 7 studies, 1 reported a marginal association in the same direction as, and with a similar magnitude to, the associations wi th statistical significance , 1 and 6 may have had insufficient statistical power for some of their analyses, which may ac count for the lack of statistical significance. For example, Feldman- Winter et al11 compared infants fed infant formula exclusively with infants fed human milk exclusively for their first week of life following birth in a Baby -Friendly hospital, where the proportion of infants never fed human mi lk was low. As a result, the confidence interval around the odds ratio was very wide (i.e., 0.1 to 7.0). Associations reported by 3 other studies had confidence intervals greater than 1, which suggests insufficient statistical power. 4,9,15 The final 2 studies did not report conf idence intervals7,30; however, de Jong et al7 had fewer participants than many of the samples in the body of evidence (about 250 participants), and Moschonis et al30 suggested that analyses of their sample from the EuroPrevall cohort ( about 300 participants) in their multi -cohort study, in particular, may have been underpowered. Directness : The evidence had strong directness. Most of the articles reported study objectives that included the examination of human milk consumption and over weight and/or obesity . Generalizability : The evidence had moderate generalizability. Eleven of the 21 studies (16 of 30 articles) were conducted in the U nited States .2,3,5,6,10,11,14,15,17,21,27,31,32,35,39,40 The studies included nationally representative samples, samples with racial and ethnic diversity, and samples from families with low income. One study was conducted in Korea,20 and the remaining 9 studies (13 of 30 articles) were conducted in European countries .1,4,7- 9,16,19,22,26,30,36,37,41 There may be some concerns about the generalizability of the evidence from these studies to U .S. populations, which may have higher risk of overweight and obesity than the populations from which participants were sampled in the non-U.S. studies . The generalizability of the evidence may also be limited because few studies examined the outcomes past childhood. Only 5 studies examined outcomes in adolescents ,6,10,27,30,32,36 and only 1 examined outcomes in adults .5,32 Risk of bias: There is a moderate likelihood that the design and conduct of the studies have prevented or minimized bias. Infant -feeding decisions can be strongly socially patterned; therefore, in this entirely observational body of evidence, the risk of bias from confounding is of particular concern. Four studies conducted within -family analyses of siblings to reduce confounding from shared genetic and environmental factors .3,6,10,14,27,32 However , these studies were prone to other risks of bias. For example, the Add Health and CDS studies asked mothers to recall how they fed their offspring during infancy when those offspring were between 4 and 18 years of age.10,27,32 In addition, in the Children of NLSY79 study some participants reported their own height and weight ,3,6 and in the Add Health s tudy the methods used to collect outcome data were not reported.10,32 None of the remaining 17 studies controlled for all of the key confounders identified on the 44 analytic framework. In particular, studies tended not to account for complementary feeding practices and childhood diet. In addition, the studies had other risks of bias, whic h varied between studies (Tables 3 and 4). Publication bias: In addition to the graded elements of the assessment of the evidence, above, it is important to give cons ideration to publication bias, which may be present given the consistency of the evidence. Conclusion: Given this synthesis and assessment of the evidence, we conclude that m oderate evidence from observational studies indicates that ever, compared with never, consuming human milk is associated with lower risk of overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older, particularly if the duration of human milk consumption is 6 months or longer . 45 Table 2.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.) 64 Duration of any human milk consumption among infants fed human milk Description of the evidence examining the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and body composition, including obesity, from studies that conducted within- family comparisons of siblings ( Table 5 ) Four articles, published between 2005 and 2014, conducted within- family analyses comparing the duration of any human milk consumption between siblings and the siblings' BMI, body fat percentage, or overweight and/or obesity status . 6,10,12,34 The articles presented evidence from 4 independent cohorts from the United States (N=3) and Finland (N=1), described below. 1. Children of the National Longitudinal Survey on Youth 1979 Cohort (Children of NLSY79) Colen and Ramey6 examined a sample of children and adolescents whose mothers were part of the NLSY79 cohort from the U nited States . The study sample consisted of the subset of offspring who wer e singletons, born after the year 1978, and 4 to 14 years of age between 1986 and 2010. About 75% of participants were non- Hispanic white. Infant -feeding data were collected by maternal report at biannual survey rounds starting in 1986. The outcomes of interest were BMI and obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth curves) at 4 to 14 years of age. Approximately 64% of height and weight data were collected by study staff, and the remainder were from maternal - or self -report. The authors conduct ed analyses on the full sample (N=8237), on a subsample consisting of participants with siblings in the study (N=7319), and on a second subsample consisting of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed differently during infancy; N=1773). In the full sample and sibling subsample, there were small, but statistically significant, inverse associations between weeks of human milk consumption and BMI at 4 to 14 years ( = In the discordant sibling subsample, there was a small positive association that was nonsignificant ( = 0.005 \u00b1 0.003). Likewise, in the full sample and sibling subsample, there were small, but statistically significant, inverse associations between weeks of human milk consumption and obesity at 4 to 14 years ( = - discordant sibling no significant association ( = 0.001 \u00b1 0.004). 2. National Longitudinal Study of A dolescent Health (Add Health) Evenhouse and Reilly 10 studied the Add Health cohort from the U nited States . This cohort is a nationally representative sample of 10- to 18- year-olds in grades 7 to 12 during the 1994- 1995 school year (baseline) . Low-income, African- American, and Hispanic youth were oversampled. The duration of any human milk consumption (i.e., 0- 3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12- 24, or >24 months) among participants fed human milk (N=7417) was collected by parent recall at baseline. The outcomes of interest were BMI, overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85 th percentile based on CDC growth curves) and obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth curves) at 10 to 18 years of age. The method used to collect anthropometric data was not reported. The authors conducted analyses on the full sample, on a subsample consisting of participants with a sibling in the study (N =1607), and on a second subsample consisting of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed human milk for different durations; N=470). 65 In the full sample, sibling subsample, and discordant sibling subsample, there were no significant assoc iations between the duration of any human milk consumption (as a quasi - continuous measure using the midpoints of the categorical durations) and BMI, overweight/obesity, or obesity at 10 to 18 years. The nonsignificant associations for the full sample and s ibling subsample were small inverse associations OR 0.01 and 0.99 \u00b1 0.01, respectively). The nonsignificant associations for the discordant sibling subsample were closer to the null or at the null (BMI = 0.01 \u00b1 0.03, overweight/obesity OR 1.01 \u00b1 0.01, obesity OR 1.00 \u00b1 0.02). 3. Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) Gillman et al 12 examined a sample of children and adolescents in the U.S. -based GUTS cohort, whose mothers were part of the Nurses' Health Study II. The study sample consisted of the subset of offspring who were (a) singletons, (b) born at 34 completed weeks of gestation or later, (c) 9 to 14 years of age at baseline, and (d) from sibships in which siblings shared the same biological father (based on maternal report of father's height). Almost all participants were white (95%). Participants self -reported their height and weight at baseline, and infant -feeding data were collected by maternal recall a year later (when participants were 10 to 15 years of age). The authors assessed the association between the duration of human milk consumption and overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85 th percentile using CDC growth curves) at 9 to 14 years in the full sample of siblings (N=5614 participants from 2709 families), and the subsample of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed human milk for different durations, N=2372). In the sample of siblings, each additional 3.7- month increase in the duration of any human milk consumption (i.e., the mean difference in duration for discordant siblings) was associated with significantly lower odds of over weight/obesity at 9 to 14 years when applying the same statistical adjustments for confounders as the discordant sibling analysis (i.e., age, sex, tanner stage, menarcheal status for girls, birthweight, birth order, inactivity, physical activity, and energy intake; OR [95% CI] = 0.88 [0.82, 0.94]). When the model was additionally adjusted for maternal BMI and smoking, and household income, the magnitude of the association was slightly attenuated and the confidence interval included the null (OR [95% CI] = 0.94 [0.88, 1.00]). In the discordant sibling analysis, there was no significant association between consuming human milk for a duration longer than the mean family duration, compared with a duration shorter than the mean family duration, and odds of overweight/obesity at 9 to 14 years of age. The odds ratio was of similar magnitude to the odds ratios in the sibling analyses above, but the confidence interval was wider and included the null (OR [95% CI] = 0.92 [0.76, 1.11]). 4. Helsinki Birth C ohort O'Tierney et al 34 studied the Helsinki Birth Cohort from Finland. Participants were born between 1934 and 1944 in Helsinki, Finland. The study sample consisted of members of the cohort who (a) were fed human milk, (b) had a sibling in the cohort, and (c) provided follow - up data in the year 2000, along with their sibling. Pediatric clinicians recorded infant feeding prospectively (participants had an average of 8 pediatric visits, which wer e free, from birth to 2 years of age). The outcomes of interest were BMI and overweight (i. e., BMI 25 -30 kg/m2) from self -reported height and weight via questionnaire (N=831), and BMI and percent body fat from clinical measurement (N=129) at about 62 years of age. The analyses compared siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed human milk for different durations). 66 There were no significant differences in BMI at about 62 years of age between participants fed human milk for <2, 3- 4, 5-7 and 8 months. It may be important to note that when BMI was based on clinical measure (but not self -report) the quadratic trend approached significance (p=0.08). The U -shaped association between duration and BMI measured in the clinic is also somewhat evident from the following analyses. In comparison to a duration of 5 to 7 months, durations of <2 months and 8 months have nonsignificant associations with higher BMI: (a) <2 compared with 5- 7 months: mean difference 2.3 kg/m 2 [95% CI - 0.1, 4.7] for clinical measure (0.3 [ -0.5, 1.1] for self- report) (b) 3-4 compared with 5- 7 months: mean difference - 0.4 kg/m2 [95% CI - 2.7, 1.8] for clinical measure (0.3 [ -0.5, 1.1] for self- report) (c) 8 compared with 5 -7 months: mean difference 1.2 kg/m2 [95% CI - 0.9, 3.2] for clinical measure (0.2 [ -0.5, 1.0] for self- report) There were no significant differences in the percent of participants who were overweight at about 62 years of age between participants fed human milk for <2, 3- 4, 5-7 and 8 months. Likewise, there were no significant differences in the percent of participants who were overweight between participants fed human milk for: (a) <2 compared with 5- 7 months: mean difference 1.6% [95% CI -7.7, 11.0] (b) mean difference 1.9% [95% CI -8.0, 11.8] (c) mean difference 8.8% [95% CI -0.3, 18.0] There was a significant quadratic trend (p=0.03) in the percent body fat of participants fed human milk for <2, 3 -4, 5-7 and 8 months. The U -shaped association between duration and percent body fat is also evident from the following analyses: (a) <2 compared with 5- 7 months: mean difference 3.9% [95% CI 0.3, 7.4]; p<0.05 (b) compared months: mean difference 0.3% [95% CI -3.1, 3.7] (c) mean difference 1.3% [95% CI -1.7, 4.3] 67 Table 5.

Four of the 19 studies were also described in the section about evidence from siblings . 6,10,12,34 A description of the studies is presented below by age group (i.e., 2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, 12 to 19 years , and 20 years and older ). Studies with evidence in multiple age groups 1. Generation Rotterdam (Generation R) Study Durmus et al (2011)9 and Durmus et al (2014)8 presented evidence from the Generation R Study, which was a prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands. Both samples consisted of singleton infants who had available information on infant feeding. Durmus et al (2011)9 examined dichotomous comparisons of 0- 3 months and 3- 6 months o f human milk consumption with >6 months of human milk consumption. Durmus et al (2014)8 examined dichotomous comparisons of >0- 1.99, 2- 3.00, and 4- 5.99 months of human milk consumption with 6 months of human milk co nsumption, and also examined the trend across the 4 duration categories. Infant -feeding data were obtained from clinical delivery reports at birth and by maternal report at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. The outcome of interest in both articles was overweight and obesity (combined). Durmus et al (2011)9 found significant inverse associations between the duration of any human milk consumption and odds of overweight/obesity at 2, but not at 3 years of age. Consuming human milk for shorter durations of 0- 3 months or 3- 6 months, in comparison to a longer duration of >6 months, was associated with significantly higher odds of overweight/obesity at 2 years at 3 years, the associations were nonsignificant and slightly below the null et al (2014) 8 found some significant positive associations between the duration of any human milk consumption and odds of overweight/obesity at 6 years of age. There was a significant trend across 4 duration categories (>0- 1.9, 2- 3.9, 4 -5.9, and 6 months). In addition, consuming human milk for the shorter duration of >0- 1.9 months, in comparison to the longer duration of 6 months, was associat ed with significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 6 years of age (OR ~0.7 with the top error bar just below 1.0). However, the association was nonsignificant when durations of 2- 3.9 and 4- 5.9 months were compared with 6 months (OR [95% CI] ~0.8 2. Moschonis et al 30 presented analyses of 4 European cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), Etude des D\u00e9terminants pr\u00e9 et post natals du d\u00e9veloppement de l'Enfant (EDEN), EuroPrevall, and Generation XXI, conducted in the U nited Kingdom , France, Greece, and Portugal, respectively. Infant -feeding data w ere collected by parent report via questionnaire at 6 and 15 months of age in ALSPAC, at 4, 8, and 12 months of age in EDEN, at 15 months of age in Generation XXI, and at 12, 24, and 30 months of age in EuroPrevall. The authors examined dichotomous comparisons of <1 72 month, 1- 3 months, and 3- 6 months, compared with 6 months of human milk consumption. Height and weight were meas ured at each study site and used to identify participants who were overweight and obese (combined, using IOTF cutoffs) at 4 (N=6522), 9 (N=7540), and 13 years of age (N=6124) in the ALSPAC cohort, at 4 years of age in the EuroPrevall (N=309) and Generation XXI (N=3387) cohorts, and at 5 years of age (N=1070) in EDEN cohort. In the ALSPAC cohort, consuming human milk for 3- 6 months, compared with 6 months, was associated with significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 4 and at 13 years of age (ORs ~0.7, p=0.008, and ~0.8, p=0.031, respectively; CIs not reported), but not at 9 years of age (OR ~1.1, CI not reported). There were no significant associations between consuming human milk for <1 or 1- 3 months, compared with 6 months, and overweight/obesi ty at 4, 9, or 13 years of age in the ALSPAC cohort (ORs ~1.0 and ~0.9, respectively, at 4 years of age, ~1.1 and ~ 1.1, respectively, at 9 years of age, and ~1.3 and ~1.0, respectively, at 13 years of age). In the EuroPrevall and Generation XXI cohorts, t here were no significant associations between consuming human milk for <1, 1 -3, or 3- 6 months, compared with 6 months, and the odds of overweight/obesity at 4 years of age (OR ~0.6, ~0.7, and ~1.3, respectively, in the EuroPrevall cohort and a nd ~1.1, respectively, in the Generation XXI cohort; CIs not reported). Likewise, in the EDEN cohort, there were no significant associations between consuming human milk for <1, 1 -3, or 3 -6 months, compared with 6 months, and the odds of overweight/obesit y at 5 years of age (OR ~0.8, ~0.8, and ~0.6, respectively; CIs not reported). 3. Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) Martin et al (2013) 25 and Martin et a l (2017)24 presented evidence from the PROBIT study conducted in Belarus. This was a cluster randomized controlled trial of an intervention to promote prolonged duration and exclusivity of human milk feeding among mothers who chose to feed human milk. The study enrolled 17,046 infants at birth and followed 13,879 children to 11.5 years of age 25 and 13,557 adolescents to 16 years of age24. Study pediatricians collected human milk -feeding data at well -baby medical appointments, and the intervention group had higher rates of any human milk consumption measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The outcomes, overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85 th percentile based on CDC growth curves) and obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth cur ves), were secondary outcomes of the studyiii and were measured by study staff. The authors used an intention- to-treat analysis that compared the intervention group with the control group. At 11.5 years of age, the intervention group had significantly higher odds of overweight/obesity (compared with BMI <85th percentile) than the control group (OR 1.18 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.39]). The odds of obesity (also compared with BMI <85th percentile) were similar, but the confidence interval was wider and included the null (OR 1.17 [0.97, 1.41]). Likewise, at 16 years of age, the intervention group had significantly higher odds of overweight/obesity (compared with BMI <85 th percentile) than the control group (OR 1.14 [95% CI: 1.02, 1.28]). The odds of obesity (in contrast to the 11.5 year analysis, this was compared with BMI <95th percentile) were slightly lower and had a wider confidence interval that included the null (OR 1.09 [0.92, 1.29]). iii U.S. National Library of Medicine.

Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy ( PIAMA) Ruijsbroek et al37 presented evidence from the PIAMA study in the Netherlands , which was a birth cohort study and prospective follow -up of (1) participants in an intervention study of mite-impermeable mattress and pillow covers , and (2) participants in a natural -history study in which no intervention was applied. The sample for the intervention arm of the study consisted of children of allergic mothers (mothers with at least 1 of the following: asthma ever, pet allergy, house dust mite allergy or nasal allergy such as hay fever). The sample for the natural -history study consisted of children born to both allergic and non- allergic mothers. The authors examined consuming human milk for 1 -16 weeks, compared with >16 weeks, as a dichotomous variable. Infant -feeding data were collected prospectively by parental report at 3 and 12 months of age. T he outcomes of interest were overweight and obesity (combined) and obesity, defined using IOTF cut -offs, at 3 to 8 years of age (N=3963). A nthropometric data were collected via parental recall (based on doctor or nurse report if measured within the last 3 months, or measured by parents), but spec ific methods were not reported. There was a significant association between consuming human milk for 1 -16 weeks, compared with >16 weeks , and higher odds of obesity at 3 to 8 years of age (OR 1.81 [95% CI 1.07, 3.04] ). The odds of overweight/obesity were in the same direction but were not statistically significant (OR 1.25 [95% CI 0.98, 1.59]). 5. Children of the National Longitudinal Survey on Youth 1979 Cohort (Children of NLSY79) Colen and Ramey 6 examined a sam ple of children and adolescents whose mothers were part of the National Longitudinal Survey on Youth 1979 Cohort from the U nited States . The study sample consisted of the subset of offspring who were singletons, born after the year 1978, and 4 to 14 years of age between 1986 and 2010. About 75% of participants were non-Hispanic white. Infant -feeding data were collected by maternal report at biannual survey rounds starting in 1986. The outcome of interest was obesity (i.e., BMI 95 th percentile based on CDC growth curves) at 4 to 14 years of age. Approximately 64% of height and weight data were from measurements by study staff, and the remainder were from maternal - or self - report. The authors conducted analyses on the full sample (N=8237), on a subsample cons isting of participants with siblings in the study (N=7319), and on a second subsample consisting of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed differently during infancy; N=1773). In the full sample and sibling subsample, there were small, but statistically significant, inverse associations between weeks of human milk consumption and obesity at 4 to 14 years ( = - discordant sibling no significant association ( = 0.001 \u00b1 0.004). 6. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Evenhouse and Reilly 10 studied the Add Health cohort from the U nited States . This cohort is a nationally representative sample of 10- to 18- year-olds in grades 7 to 12 during the 1994- 1995 school year (baseline). Low -income, African- American, and Hispanic youth were oversampled. The duration of any human milk consumption (i.e., 0- 3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12- 24, or >24 months) among participants fed human milk (N=7417) was collected by parent recall at baseline. The outcom es of interest were overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85th percentile based on CDC growth curves) and obesity (i.e., BMI 95th percentile based on CDC growth curves) at 10 to 18 years of age. The method used to collect anthropometric data was not reported. The authors conducted analyses on the full sample, on a subsample consisting of participants with a sibling in the study (N=1607), and on a second subsample consisting of 74 siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed human milk for different durations; N=470). In the full sample, sibling subsample, and discordant sibling subsample, there were no significant associations between the duration of any human milk consumption (as a quasi - continuous measure using the midpoints of the categorical durati ons) and overweight/obesity or obesity at 10 to 18 years. The nonsignificant associations for the full sample and sibling subsample were small inverse associations and 0.99 \u00b1 0.01, respectively ). The nonsignificant associations for the discordant sibling subsample were closer to the null or at the null (overweight/obesity OR 1.01 \u00b1 0.01, obesity OR 1.00 \u00b1 0.02). 7. Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) Gillman et al 12 examined a sample of children and adolescents in the U.S. -based GUTS cohort, whose mothers were part of the Nurses' Health Study II. The study sample consisted of the subset of offspring who were (a) singletons, (b) born at 34 completed weeks of gestation or later, (c) 9 to 14 years of age at baseline, and (d) from sibships in which siblings shared the same biological father (based on maternal report of father's height). Almost all participants were white (95%). Participants self -reported their height and weight at baseline, and infant -feeding data were collected by maternal recall a year later (when participants were 10 to 15 years of age). The authors assessed the association between the duration of human milk consumption and overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI 85 th percentile using CDC growth curves) at 9 to 14 years in the ful l sample of siblings (N=5614 participants from 2709 families), and the subsample of siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed human milk for different durations, N=2372). In the sample of siblings, each additional 3.7- month increase in the duration of any human milk consumption (i.e., the mean difference in duration for discordant siblings) was associated with significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity at 9 to 14 years when applying the same statistical adjustments for confounders as t he discordant sibling analysis (i.e., age, sex, tanner stage, menarcheal status for girls, birthweight, birth order, inactivity, physical activity, and energy intake; OR [95% CI] = 0.88 [0.82, 0.94]). W hen the model was additionally adjusted for maternal B MI and smoking, and household income, the magnitude of the association was slightly attenuated and the confidence interval included the null (OR [95% CI] = 0.94 [0.88, 1.00]). In the discordant sibling analysis, there was no significant association between consuming human milk for a duration longer than the mean family duration, compared with a duration shorter than the mean family duration, and odds of overweight/obesity at 9 to 14 years of age. The odds ratio was of similar magnitude to the odds ratios in the sibling analyses above, but the confidence interval was wider and included the null (OR [95% CI] = 0.92 [0.76, 1.11]). 8. Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (CDS) Jiang and Foster 18 examined a sample of randomly -selected children born between 1984 and 1997 from the U .S.-based CDS. The sample was 47% white, 40% black, and 13% of of other racial or ethnic backgrounds. The authors examined the number of months participants consumed human milk as a continuous variable, which was truncated at 12 months for those who consumed human milk beyond the first year (N=268). Infant -feeding data were reported by mothers in 1997 when participants were between 4 months and 13 years of age. The outcome of interest was obesity at 5 to 18 years of age (i.e., BMI 95 th percentile based on CDC growth curves; N=1512). Height and w eight were measured by study staff for 99% of 75 participants using methods that were not reported. For the remaining 1% of participants, height and weight were reported by parents from participants' last doctor's visit. There was no significant association between the number of months participants consumed human milk and obesity at 5- 18 years of age (data not reported). Studies with evidence from 2 to 5 years of age Colen and Ramey6: See number 5, above Durmus et al (2011)9: See number 1, above 9. Child, Parents, and Health: Lifestyle and Genetic Constitution (KOALA) Gubbels et al13 assessed participants in the prospective KOALA birth cohort study from the Netherlands. The sample consisted of infants born to mothers with \"conventional lifestyles\" (about 83% of the baseline sample) and \"alternative lifestyles\" w ith regard to child- rearing practices, dietary habits (e.g., organic, vegetarian), vaccination schemes, and/or use of antibiotics. Infant -feeding data were collected by parent report via questionnaires at 3, 7, and 12 months of age, and the authors examine d the duration of any human milk consumption, in months, as a continuous variable. Height and weight data were also reported by parents when participants were 2 and 4 years of age. The outcome of interest was overweight/obesity ( combined; i.e., BMI z -score 85 th percentile according to a national reference). There was no association between the number of months participants consumed human milk and the odds of overweight/obesity at 2 or 4 years of age (i.e., the odds were at the null; OR [95% CI] 1.01 and Foster18: See number 8, above 10. Steps to H ealthy Development (STEPS) Makela et al23 examined participants in the STEPS study, a prospective cohort study conducted in Finland. The sample was 100% Finnish. Infant -feeding data were reported prospectively by parents using a diary, and the study authors assessed the duration of any human milk consumption, in months, as a continuous variable. Health- care professionals measured weight and length (<24 months) or height (>24 mont hs) of participants and identified individuals who were overweight or obese at 2 years of age by plotting BMI on national growth references. There was no significant association between the number of months participants consumed human milk and the odds of overweight or obesity at 2 years of age (OR 0.96, p=0.157 and 0.93, p=0.141, respectively; CIs not reported). 11. Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Oregon PRAMS) Modrek et al 28 assessed data collected through Oregon PRAMS , a state -based data collection initiative of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U nited States . The sample was born in 2009, and had mothers (selected via PRAMS by stratified random sampling of birth certificates) who completed PRAMS surveys when their child was 2 to 6 months and 2 years of age. Oregon oversampled mothers from racial and ethnic minorities; however the sample was still predominantly non- Hispanic white (i.e., 76% of mothers; child race and ethnicity were not reported). T he exposure of interest was the duration of any human milk consumption, in weeks, as a continuous variable. The authors used an instrumental variable analysi s that used variation on whether a mother fed human milk to her 76 infant exclusively in the hospital after birth (data collected at the first survey) as an instrumental variable to examine the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption (data collected in the second survey) and the outcome of interest. The outcomes of interest were overweight at 2 years of age and obesity at 2 years of age, applying IOTF thresholds. Weight and height at 2 years of age were reported by mothers during the second survey. There was a significant inverse association between the duration of any human milk consumption and obesity at 2 years of age (instrumental variable estimate - 0.0082 [ SE - 0.018, -0.001]; p<0.05 ). The association wi th overweight was similar but was not statistical ly significant (instrumental variable estimate -0.008 [ SE -0.024, 0.004]; p<0.1 Ruijsbroek et al37: See number 4, above 12. Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Alaska PRAMS) Wojcicki et al42 assessed data collected through Alaska PRAMS. The sample was born in 2005- 2006, and had mothers ( selected via PRAMS by stratified random sampling of birth certificates) who completed PRAMS surveys when their children were 2 to 6 months and 3 years of age. Alaska conducted stratification according to maternal Alaska Native race and infant birth weight. The exposure of interest was the duration of any human milk consumption, in months, as a continuous variable. Weight and height at 3 years of age were reported by mothers during the second survey . The outcome of interest was obesity at 3 years of age (i.e., BMI 95 th percentile; the growth reference used was not reported). The authors conducted analyses in Alaska non- Native (N=474) and Alaska Native (N=226) children. In Alaska non- Native participants, there was a significant inverse association between the number of months of human milk consumption and odds of obesity at 3 years of age (OR 0.95 [ 95% CI 0.91, 0.995] , p=0.03). In Alaska Native participants, the association was nonsignificant (OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.96, 1.02] , p=0.44). Studies with evidence from 6 to 11 years of age 13. Bjertnaes et al4 examined a sample of children enrolled in a prospective cohort study conducted in Norway (no cohort name provided). Children included in the cohort started school in Oppland County, a predominantly rural county, in 2007. The authors examined the number of months participants consumed human milk as a continuous variable. Infant - feeding data were recalled by parents at routine school entry health assessments when children were 5- 6 years of age. The outcome of interest was overweight/obesity (combined) at approximately 8 years of age (N=951) using BMI cut -offs provided by the IOTF. Height and weight were measured by school nurses, but specific methods were not reported. There was no significant association between the number of months participants consumed human milk and the odds of overweight/obesity at 8 years of age (OR 1.02 [95% CI 0. 99, 1.06], p=0.25) Colen and number 1, above Evenhouse and Reilly10: See number 6, above 77 Gillman et al12: See number 7, above 14. Growing Right Onto Wellness (GROW) Heerman et al15 examined data from a prospective cohort from the GROW study conducted in the U nited States . Participants were from low -income families (e.g., 100% qualified for services for underserved populations such as Medicaid or WIC, 43% were food insecure), mostly Hispanic (i.e., 63% Hispanic Mexican, 28% Hispanic non- Mexican, 9% non- Hispanic), and considered to be at high risk for developing obesity at baseline when they were 3 to 5 years of age (i.e., BMI 50 th and <95th percentile based on CDC growth curves). Infant - feeding data were collected by parent recall at bas eline, and the authors examined a dichotomous comparison of <6 months with 6 months of human milk consumption. Trained study staff measured height and weight. The outcome of interest was obesity (i.e., BMI 95 th percentile based on CDC growth curves) when participants were a mean of about 7 years of age. In this high- risk U .S. cohort, there was no significant association between consuming human milk for <6 months, compared with 6 months, and the odds of obesity at about 7 years of age (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.46, 1.14]). Jiang and Foster 18: See number 8, above Martin et al (2013)25: See number 3, above 15. Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) Massion et al26 examined samples of children who participated in the MCS, a nationally representative sample of children born in the U nited Kingdom between September 2000 and January 2002. C hildre n living in disadvantaged areas and ethnic minor ities were oversam pled to adequately represent hard- to-reach populations. The authors exam ined consuming human milk for <4 months, compared with > 4 months , as a dichotomous variable. Infant -feeding data were obtained by parent report at the first interview when infants were between 6 and 12 months of age (mean age of 9.2 months). The outcome of interest was overweight and obesity (combined; defined using IOTF cutoffs) at 11 years of age (N=11 ,764). Children's heights and weights were measured by trained r esearch staff using standardized protocols. The authors reported no significant association between consuming human milk for <4 months, compared with >4 months, and the relative risk of overweight/obesity at 11 years of age (RR ~1.1 [95% CI ~0.9, ~1.2]). 16. Danish National Birt h Cohort (DNBC) Morgen et al 29 examined a sample from the DNBC. Participants were born full term between 1996 and 2002, and did not have any siblings in the cohort. Infant -feeding data were reported prospectively by mothers during interviews at 6 and 18 months of infant age. The number of weeks infants consumed human milk was assessed using dichotomous comparisons of 20.0- 31.9 weeks and 32.0- 39.9 weeks with 40 weeks. At 7 years of age, height and weight were measured and reported by mothers for the major ity of participants (67%) or by school doctors, public -health nurses, or general practitioners. Values reported by mothers were compared with values measured by school doctors or public -health nurses for a subgroup of participants (N=1122), and the study authors found no systematic differences. At 11 years of age, height and weight were only reported by parents. The outcome of interest was overweight/obesity (based on IOTF references) as a dichotomous variable at 7 and 11 years of age. 78 There was a signific ant association between consuming human milk for 20.0 -31.9 weeks, compared with 40 weeks, and lower odds of overweight/obesity at both 7 and 11 years of age consuming human milk for 32.0- 39.9 weeks, compared with 40 weeks, and odds of overweight/obesity at 7 and 11 years of age were in the same direction, but were attenuated and no longer statistically significant Garcia et al33 presented evidence from the MALAMA study in Spain. Participants were born full term (i.e., gestational age >37 weeks) with a birthweight >2500g, had 1- and 5- minute Apgar scores of 7 and 8, respectively, and had infant -feeding and anthropometric data for the analyses (N=231). Infant -feeding data were reported prospectively by parents during interviews with trained nurses at birth and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of infant age. The study examined the number of weeks i nfants consumed any human milk as a continuous variable. Weight and height at 6 years of age were measured by pediatricians during well - child primary care visits, and the authors assessed overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI >1 SD based on WHO growth curves) at 6 years of age. The authors found no significant association between the number of weeks participants consumed human milk and overweight/obesity at 6 years of age (=0.015 [ 95% CI 0.003, 0.032], p=0.11). number 4, above 18. Skledar and Milosevic38 conducted a retrospective cohort study of Caucasian children who were in their first year of primary school in Croatia between 2002 and 2006. All children in the cohort were born full term (i.e., 37 to 42 weeks gestational age), and had complete data on infant feeding, anthropometry, and the confounding variables used in the analyses (N=302). Infant -feeding data, height, and weight were recorded in medical charts prospectively by primary care providers and obtained retrospectively for the study from a medi cal chart review. The authors examined the number of months infants consumed any human milk as a continuous variable, and the odds of overweight/obesity at 6 to 7 years of age (i.e., BMI 85 th percentile based on CDC growth curves). There was a nonsignifi cant positive association between the number of months participants consumed human milk and the odds of overweight/obesity at 6 to 7 years of age; the wide confidence interval included the null (OR 1.45 [ 95% CI 0.95, 2.20], p=0.080).

Helsinki Birth Cohort O'Tierney et al34 studied the Helsinki Birth Cohort from Finland. Participants were born between 1934 and 1944 in Helsinki, Finland. The study sample consisted of members of the cohort who (a) were fed human milk, (b) had a sibling in the cohort, and (c) provided follow - up data in the year 2000, along with their sibling. Pediatric clinicians recorded infant feeding prospectively (participants had an average of 8 pediatric visits, which were free, from birth to 2 years of age). The outcome of interest was overweight (i. e., BMI 25 -30 kg/m 2) from self- reported height and weight via questionnaire (N=831) at about 62 years of age. The analyses compared siblings with discordant infant feeding (i.e., siblings fed human milk for different durations). There were no significant differences in the percent of participants who were overweight at about 62 years of age between partici pants fed human milk for <2, 3- 4, 5-7 and 8 months. Likewise, there were no significant differences in the percent of participants who were overweight between participants fed human milk for: (a) <2 compared with 5- 7 months: mean difference 1.6% [95% CI -7.7, 11.0] (b) mean difference 1.9% [95% CI -8.0, 11.8] (c) 8.8% [95% CI -0.3, 18.0] Synthesis and assessmentiv of the evidence examining the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and overweight and/or obesity at 2 years of age and older ( Table 6 ) Twenty -one articles presented evidence from 19 independent studies about the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and overweight and/or obesity at 2 years of age and older .4,6,8- 10,12,13,15,18,23- 26,28- 30,33,34,37,38,42 A synthesis and assessment of the evidence follows. Consistency: Nine of the 19 studies (11 of 21 articles) found significant associations between the duration of any human milk consumption and overweight and/or obesity. The significant associations were inconsistent in direction: Five of the 9 studies found significant inverse associations between the duration of human milk consumption and overweight/obesity at 2 years of age, 28 3 years of age,42 3 to 8 years of age,37 4 to 14 years of age,6 and 9 to 14 years of age.12 Four of these studies were from the United States6,12,28,42 and 1 was from t he Netherlands .37 Three of the 9 studies found significant positive associations between the duration of human iv A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic -reviews and in Part of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Commi ttee. 20 20.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC. 80 milk consumption and overweight/obesity at 4 and 13 years of age,30 7 and 11 years of age,29 and 11.5 and 16 years of age.24,25 All 3 studies were from Europe (Belarus, Denmark, and the U .K. arm of a multi -cohort study). The last of the 9 studies , also from Europe (t he Netherlands ), reported significant associations , but in opposite directions , in different articles .8,9 Shorter , compared with longer, durations of human milk consumption were associated with higher risk of overweight/obesity at 2 years of age and lower risk of overweight/obesity at 6 years of age. The remaining 10 studies found no significant associations between the duration of any human milk consumption and overweight and/or obesity at ages between 2 and 62 years of age. 4,10,13,15,18,23,26,33,34,38 Five studies we re of particular interest because they used analyses intended to help address bias from confounding, which may pervade i nfant -feeding research (see Risk of B ias, below). One study was a cluster randomized trial to promote prolonged duration and exclusivity of human milk feeding, which resulted in an intervention group with significantly higher rates of any human milk consum ption measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Study authors, therefore, were able to conduct intention- to-treat analyses of the intervention versus control group to examine the effect of the intervention on overweight/obesity and obesity. 24,25 There were also 4 observational studies that conducted within- family analyses of siblings fed differently in infancy, reducing confounding from genetic and environmental factors that siblings share.6,10,12,34 The evidence from these 5 studies was also inconsistent: The intention- to-treat analyses found that the intervention group had a higher risk of overweight and/or obesity at 11.5 and 16 years of age.24,25 None of the within- family analyses of siblings found significant associations between the duration of any human milk consumption and risk of overweight and/or obesity; point estimates were at or close to the null. We also examined BMI in 2 studies that had both full -sample and within- family analyses.6,10 One study did not find significant associations between the duration of human milk consumption and BMI at 10 to 18 years of age in either analysis . 10 One study found a significant association between the duration of human milk consumption and lower BMI at 4 to 14 years of age in the full -sample analysis that was nonsignificant and in the opposite direction in the within -family analysis.6 One study assessed percent body fat, and found a significant association between consuming human milk for <2 months, compared with 5- 7 months, and higher percent body fat at 62 years of age; however, there was not a full -sample analysis with which to compare the within- family analysis. In summary , evidence for an association between the duration of any human milk consumption, among infants fed human milk, and overweight and/or obesity was inconsistent . One trend in the evidence emerged, which may help explain some of the inconsistencies in the findings between the studies . The direction of the statistically significant associations between the duration of human milk consumption and overweight and/or obesity diff ered somewhat between studies conducted in the U nited States and studies conducted in Europe. Four of the 5 studies reporting significant inverse associations between duration and overweight/obesity were from the United States ,6,12,28,42 and all 3 studies reporting significant positive associations were from Europe.24,25,29,30 It is possible that the association between the duration of any human milk consumption and overweight and/or obesity differs between the United States and other 81 populations (see Generalizability, below). Precision: Nine of the 19 studies in this body of evidence had sufficient statistical power to detect significant associations . Of the 10 remaining studies, only 2 had wide confidence intervals suggestive of suboptimal statistical power .34,38 The remaining studies with nonsignificant findings were likely to have sufficient statistical power ; in several cases they examine d the duration of any human milk consumption as a continuous variable usi ng a sizeable analytic sample (N=231 to 7417) , and in other cases (i.e., when using categorical variables for duration of human milk consumption) the lack of significance was not attributable to a wide confidence interval but rather to the fact that the point estimates were close to the null .4,10,13,18,23,26,33 Directness : Most of the articles reported study objectives that included the examination of human milk consumption and overweight and/or obesity. Generalizability : Seven of the 19 studies were conducted in the U nited States .6,10,12,15,18,28,42 The rest were from European countries, and there are some concerns about the generalizability of this evidence to U.S. populations, which may have higher risk of overweight and obesity than the populations from which participant s were sampled in the European studies. For example, the authors of the cluster randomized trial in Belarus noted the much lower prevalence of obesity (i.e., about 5% of the sample at 16 years of age) in comparison to youth in the U nited States . 24,25 Another limitation to the generalizability of the evidence is that the majority of evidence exam ined outcomes in childhood. Only 6 studies examined outcomes in adolescents , 6,10,12,18,24,30 and only 1 study examined outcomes in adults .34 Risk of bias: Infant -feeding decisions can be strongly socially patterned, and i n this largely observational body of evidence, 5 studies used approaches that were likely to reduce bias from confounding. First, there was 1 cluster randomized trial , and randomization mitigates confounding. 24,25 Next, there were 4 observational studies that conducted within- family analyses of siblings fed differently in infancy .6,10,12,34 Such analyses reduce confounding from genetic and environmental factors , which siblings share; h owever, these studies had other risks of bias. For example, in 2 studies, mothers were asked to recall infant -feeding data when participants were between 10 and 18 years of age.10,12 In addition, in 2 studies, all participants reported their own height and weight ,12,34 in a 3rd study, some participants reported their own height and weight ,6 and in the 4th study, the method of anthropometric data collection was not reported.10 None of the remaining 14 studies controlled for all of the key confounders identified on the analytic framework, and the studies had other risks of bias, which varied between studies (Tables 7 and 8). Publication bias: 82 In addition to the graded elements of the assessment of the evidence, above, it is important to give consideration to publication bias. There is not a strong indication of publication bias because there are several publ ished studies and they present evidence of associations that are both significant and nonsignificant, and inconsistent in direction. Conclusion: Given this synthesis and assessment of the evidence, we conclude that insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between the duration of any human milk consumption among infants fed human milk and overweight and obesity at 2 years of age and older , because the available evidence is inconsistent. 83 Table 6.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Washington, DC.) 93 Duration of exclusive human milk consumption before the introduction of infant formula Two articles , published in 2015 and 2018, were identified that met the inclusion criteria and examined the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk cons umption before the introduction of infant formula and overweight and/or obesity at 2 years of age and older .33,38 Ortega -Garcia et al33 presented evidence from the Medio Ambiente y Lactancia Materna (MALAMA) study in Spain. Participants were born f ull term (i.e., gestational age >37 weeks) with a birthw eight >2500g, had 1- and 5- minute Apgar scores of 7 and 8, respectively, and had infant -feeding and anthropometric data for the analyses (N=231). Infant -feeding data were reported prospectively by parents during interviews with trained nurses at birth and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of infant age. The study examined the number of weeks infants consumed human milk exclusively, before bottle feeding was introduced, as a continuous variable. Weight and height at 6 years of age were measured by pediatricians during well -child primary care visits, and the authors assessed overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI >1 SD based on WHO growth curves) at 6 years of age. The authors found a significant inverse association between the number of weeks participants consumed human mil k and overweight/obesity at 6 years of age (=-0.052 [95% CI - 0.10, -0.003], p=0.04). Skledar and Milosevic 38 conducted a retrospective cohort study of Caucasian children who were in their first year of primary school in Croatia between 2002 and 2006. All children in the cohort were born full term (i.e., 37 to 42 weeks gestational age), and had complete data on infant feeding, anthropometry, and the confounding variables used in the analyses (N=302). Infant - feeding data, height, and weight were recorded in medical charts prospectively by primary care providers and obtained retrospectively for the study from a medic al chart review. The authors compared infants who consumed human milk without additional formula with infants who consumed human milk with infant formula added to the diet before 3 months of age, and examined the odds of overweight/obesity at 6 to 7 years of age (i.e., BMI 85 th percentile based on CDC growth curves). A shorter duration of exclusive human milk consumption prior to the introduction of infant formula (i.e., <3 months), compared with a longer duration (i.e., 3 months), was associated with significantly higher odds of overweight/obesity at 6 to 7 years of age (OR 3.35 [95% CI 1.31, 8.60], p=0.012). The 2 studies presented evidence that was consistent in direction, showing that shorter durations of exclusive human milk consumption, prior to the introduction of infant formula, are associated with higher risk of overweight and obesity at 6 to 7 years of age. However, the evidence from these 2 observational studies is insufficient to determine the relationship between the duration of exclusive hum an milk consumption prior to the introduction of infant formula and overweight and/or obesity at 2 years of age and older. v v A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020- dieta ry-guidelines -advisory -committee in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 2020.

Sibling -pair studies are one example of this type of study design, but there are few such studies and they tend to have much smaller sample sizes than other types of observational studies. There is a need for larger sibling- pair studies, and for such studies to examine siblings that differ in terms of the duration of human milk consumption (e.g., <6 mo, 6 mo), not just with respect to ever vs. never consuming human milk. Another way to approach these questions is with randomized trials of breastfeeding promotion, as was done in the PROBIT trial in Belarus vi. If the trial achieves substantial differences in duration or exclusivity of breastfeeding between intervention groups, this provides an opportunity to examine effects on subsequent overweight or obesity (and many other outcomes). Observational studies that make use of large datasets, especially those that follow participants longitudinally and in particular, link children with siblings and parents, would also be very useful for more robustly assessing associations and providing more confidence in conclusions regarding causality. This could be achieved by linking surveillance systems that collect data about infant feeding and health outcomes (including overweight and obesity), and making use of emerging electronic medical record data. In general, observational studies need to pay careful attention to minimizing confounding, taking into account all of the key confounders in the analytical framework for this review including aspects of the child's diet (complementary feeding and later dietary patterns). The use of instrumental variables such as Mendelian randomization approaches can also be hel pful in minimizing confounding. In both observational and intervention studies, researchers should consider effect modification in their study design whenever possible (e.g., child sex, parental obesity, socioeconomic status, child diets, child activity levels) to examine the impact of infant feeding on these outcomes within key subgroups. vi Kramer, M.

It also includes definitions of key terms and identifies key confounders considered in the systematic review. The inclusion and exclusion criteria that follow provide additional information about how parts of the analytic framework were defined and operationalized for the review. Figure 1. Analytic framework 103 LITERATURE SEARCH AND SCREENING PLAN Inclusion and exclusion cr iteria This table provides the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are a set of characteristics that were used to determine which articles identified in the literature search were included in or excluded from the systematic review. Table 11. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Category Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Study participants Human participants Males Females Non-human participants (e.g., animal and in- vitro studies) Additional criteria for study participants for within -family studies of siblingsviii Siblings with discordant expsoures or outcomes or both (i.e., siblings fed differently during infancy or with differences in outcome status or both), who were compared using within- family analyses Siblings who were not compared using within -family analyses Health status of study participants Studies that enroll participants: born full -term (37 weeks and 0/7 days gestational age) who are healthy and/or at risk for chronic disease Studies that enroll some participants: born preterm (gestational age <37 weeks and 0/7 days), with low birth weight (<2500g), or small for gestational age with failure to thrive/underweight, stunting, or wasting Studies that exclusively enroll participants: born preterm (gestational age <37 weeks and 0/7 days), with low birth weight (<2500g), or small for gestational age with failure to thrive/underweight, stunting, or wasting diagnosed with a disease or hospitalized with an illness or injury viiiInfant -feeding research is mostly observational (due to ethical concerns about randomizing infants to be fed less or no human milk) and is prone to confounding because infant -feeding decisions are strongly socially patterned. Wtihin- family analyses of siblings help address confounding from genetic and environmental factors (factors that siblings share). Therefore, the systematic review gave particular attention to the results from within- famly analyses of siblings, and there are additional inclusion and exclusion criteira that applied to these studies. 104 Category Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Interventions/ exposuresix 1.
