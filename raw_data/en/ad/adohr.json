A new name, a new mission Photo by Dennis Wiancko OUR HOLISTIC THERAPIES Our holistic therapies are designed to support the body's own healing abilities, regulate your immune system, and address chronic health issues. NEW LOCATION COMING 2024 The historic View Point Inn We have broken ground at our new location, the historic View Point Inn in the Columbia Gorge. CLASSICAL CHINESE MEDICINE The cornerstone of our practice is meeting every patient's needs with tailored Chinese herbal prescriptions and high quality food grade supplements specifically formulated for natural medicine. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING \"For many years, Heiner and the Hai Shan clinic [now The Healing Order] staff have supported me through acute conditions as well as through the seasonal support that Traditional Chinese Medicine offers. I have learned to trust and appreciate the personal prescriptions matched to my body. There is an abundance of kindness and caring from all at the clinic.\" LINDA H., BORING, OR \"I have been a patient of Heiner for more than 23 years. At that time I was very ill, and Western medicine had failed to help me... I believe that without Heiner's care, I would have been chronically ill. With Heiner's care, I was able to come back to vibrant health following this very debilitating illness. I feel complete trust in his deep and profound understanding of how classical Chinese medicine can support my healing from whatever health challenge I might be facing. I always feel respected and listened to by the staff at The Healing Order. I am so grateful to have found Heiner.\" MARY K., PORTLAND, OR \"When I first began seeing Heiner, I had been chronically sick (respiratory issues) for a few years. Western medicine kept putting me on antibiotics, which would make me feel better for a month or two, and as soon as I began feeling sick again, more antibiotics, on and on. I was wondering if I was ever going to get truly well. After working with Heiner for a little while, I began feeling better and have now felt consistently healthy for years. Dr. Heiner Fruehauf has my absolutely highest recommendation, beyond anything I could say in words.\" PAUL L., PORTLAND, OR \"After working with Heiner I no longer have chronic lymphocytic leukemia. My oncologist says it's a spontaneous remission; I say it's Heiner! At The Healing Order, I'm not an isolated disease but a whole person brought into equilibrium by practitioners who are highly skilled, perceptive, and caring. They don't give up. It's an amazing place.\" EMILY W., PORTLAND, OR \"For more than 20 years I've trusted The Healing Order to guide my health. They take the guesswork out of optimal health. I was shown what foods to avoid and given herbs exactly designed for my body. It's so hard to tell what supplements to buy in the grocery store, and it seems like every naturopath has a different set of favorites, but at The Healing Order, everyone works together to offer the optimum supplements and herbs to support your health. Recently, when I thought I had COVID-19, I contacted Dr. Metro and described my symptoms. He sent me Classical Pearls and supplements that helped me quickly return to my normal healthy self.\" JESSE R., BEND, OR \"I have been in private practice for 25 years. I have always aligned myself with practitioners of like mind, who I can consult with on matters beyond my scope. Heiner Fruehauf, far and away, has been the best. He has helped me with my personal health, and I have sent him and Dr. Metro patients with serious, even terminal diagnosis, with remarkable results. I use his TCM formulas in my practice and with my family. Heiner's brilliant mind and humble spirit and his welcoming and knowledgeable staff make The Healing Order a treasure in the Pacific Northwest.\" OLGA D., ESTACADA, OR \"Heiner Fruehauf and The Healing Order team cannot be recommended enough. The combination of ancient Chinese medical wisdom and treatments, modern Western technology, and direct supervision of the production of the Chinese herbs, which are blended with 'Western' supplements - all of this results in a level of treatment care that I have not found anywhere else. Having Heiner and his team 'on my side' has changed my positive impact potential for the remaining years on this planet. It's that important.\" HANS K., OAKLAND, CA \"Our family has been struggling with chronic Lyme disease for years. We have seen many practitioners and naturopaths in multiple cities but nothing compares to the level of care we have received from The Healing Order. Other treatments left me feeling depleted and damaged, but the doctors at The Healing Order provide custom formulas that support your body so it can heal itself. Their compassion is matched only by their wisdom. There is no one else that I would trust with my family's health. We are so fortunate to have this healing sanctuary nearby.\" ERIKA T., PORTLAND, OR \"I had lost hope of ever being well again when I first stepped inside the Hai Shan Clinic [now The Healing Order] 7 years ago. Dr Heiner Fruehauf's reputation preceded him so I knew the long trip for each visit would be worth the travel. Nestled in the Columbia River Gorge, one of the prettiest places on Earth, we make each visit to the clinic a mini vacation in the Gorge, Hood River area. Hai Shan is staffed by a group of truly caring practitioners. Under the brilliance of Dr Fruehauf, the Hai Shan Clinic restored my hope of wellness and gave me back my health free of disease.\" RUTH R., TUSCALOOSA, AL \"Having moved to Portland from California 15 years ago, it was a great gift to be introduced to Heiner and the Hai Shan Clinic [now The Healing Order] by a friend. It was such a blessing, as my naturopath in California did not have a Portland area naturopath to recommend! And moving to Oregon with its damp climate, I was forewarned that my asthma and allergies might become really the worst ever. However, with the clear expert help from Drs. Fruehauf and Metro, my fears were put to rest quickly! And now, 15 years later, I am basically allergy and asthma free---thanks to their diagnosis and the excellent supplements, diet suggestions, treatments and follow-up! I look forward to my acupuncture treatments at the end of each visit as well, because they always seem to have the most amazing people to do this! Everyone at the clinic has always been friendly, helpful, courteous, able to help, and always willing to find answers to my questions. I can heartily recommend them to any and all friends and contacts---it's so uplifting to have them by my side now!\" WALTER R., PORTLAND, OR \"I consider Heiner Fruehauf to be my primary healthcare provider because he has helped me work through a number of stress-related healthcare challenges over the past 20 years. Additionally, my daughter with Asperger's and my spouse have experienced great benefits with other types of health concerns. I particularly appreciate how this model of wellness identifies the Chinese herbs and supplements our bodies actually need, as opposed to what is wrong with us or what disease we may or may not have. While I have certainly benefited from western medicine at times, I am forever grateful to have the Hai Shan Center serve as my foundation for a healthy life.\" PAUL W., PORTLAND, OR \"For over 8 years starting in 2002 I experienced a downward spiral in my health that left me suffering from a undiagnosed chronic disease. In 2010 I was referred to the Hai Shan Clinic [now The Healing Order]. For the first time I had finally found a medical clinic focused on a holistic approach to healing instead of concentrating on a collection of disparate issues along with doctors who took the time to listen. I consider the staff at Hai Shan family and will be forever grateful for the knowledge, compassion, time and wisdom that has been gifted to me through the years. I believe that everyone is capable of significant healing by choosing the right healthcare team to partner with who can provide an individualized solid course of action plan while providing guidance to stay on track. I am fortunate to have found the dream team, Dr. Heiner Freuhauf & Dr. Chris Metro, who I credit with saving my life and putting me on a path towards health and vitality again through their in-depth knowledge of Chinese Medicine and proven methodology of Chinese Herbs.\" MARY S., PORTLAND, OR I met Dr. Fruehauf and the wonderful team at the Hai Shan Center [now The Healing Order] in 2015, after eleven years of antibiotics and cutting-edge naturopathic treatments had failed to cure a serious case of Lyme disease with viral, bacterial and parasitic co-infections. Dr. Fruehauf's protocol of herbs, supplements, acupuncture and qi gong helped me clear these illnesses, including the Lyme and an infestation of parasites that had resisted every anti-parasitic drug known to humankind. He gave me back a faith in myself, with the understanding that my body could heal in harmony with the laws of nature. It can be hard to describe true healing in words, but perhaps it is something like this: peace; safety; energy; sanity; a restoration; an awakening. I found all this at Hai Shan. If you go there, I believe you will find it too, and you will be met with intelligence, integrity, wisdom, kindness, excellence, compassion and good cheer from everyone there. I cannot sing their praises highly enough, and I will be forever grateful for their care. They have given me back my life. REGINA W., NEW YORK, NY \"My family and I have been clients of Heiner and the Hai Shan Clinic [now The Healing Order] for over 20 years. During that time, we have been treated for several health issues including cancer. Hai Shan Clinic gives us access to Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments and remedies that would otherwise be unavailable. In our experience, Heiner and his staff provide clinical expertise along with unparalleled compassion and respect. We are grateful for the quality of care we have received.\" STEPHEN B., PORTLAND, OR \"I have nothing but the deepest respect and gratitude for the work of everyone at Hai Shan Clinic [now The Healing Order]. A lifetime of chronic illness had left me with no more viable options in the world of Western-style medicine. Hai Shan Clinic is where I finally have had the experience of being seen and heard. I am finding healing...something I have always sought but never achieved in a way I have always believed to be possible. With a vast and deep understanding of Chinese medicine, the support of all who work at Hai Shan Clinic, the loving generosity of the Plant and Animal Kingdoms, and my own capacity and willingness to do the work and make the changes to heal, I am finding extraordinary results on all levels of my health, well-being and Spirit.\" PENNYLEA M., BOISE, ID OUR BLOG THE HEALING LIFE Thriving during the holidays is different for each person. The winter season when yin is at its apex is a season of regeneration. If we listen to the cycle of the days, we will naturally seek warmth and more rest, warmer and slower cooked foods. This is a time of nourishing our yin and protecting our yang, to restore our innermost treasures. Soon we will be at the darkest and most yin time of the year, the Winter Solstice.

Our vital qi, brightened by summer skies, now begins its movement inward as we ready ourselves for winter. Autumn is a time for gathering ourselves for the year ahead. We move indoors. It is a great time restructure what we do and want to do, creating time and space for reflection and planning. Our intentions turn inward to protect the yang qi we built up over the summer season and nourish our interior and our yin.

[Read More ](/blog/fragrant-poached-quince-fresh-ginger-cookies) As a nutritionist, I am often asked about mindfulness and intuitive eating. There are varying degrees of what these terms mean and how they can look in action. I interpret intuitive eating as listening deeply to what the body is asking for, and then acting with intention and responsibility to nourish those needs. Some use this principle to defend eating foods that are harmful-like processed or sugar-laden foods-but this is not what true intuitive eating is or should be. I will reserve my thoughts on this for another time, and merely state again that listening to the needs of your body should be followed by choosing the foods that will nourish cravings and thirst rather than contribute to internal stress and dis-ease.
