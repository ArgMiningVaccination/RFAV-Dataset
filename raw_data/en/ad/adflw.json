Biologi cal safety cabinets (BSC) : An enclosed, ventilated working space designed to provide protection to the operator, the laboratory environment and/or the work materials for activities where there is an aerosol hazard. Containment is achieved by segregation of the work from the main area of the laboratory and/or through the use of controlled, directional airflow mechanisms. Exhaust air is passed through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculating into the laboratory or into the building's heating, ventilation and air conditioning system. There are different classes (I, II and III) of BSCs that provide different levels of containment. Biorisk : Risk relating to biosafety and biosecurity where the principal hazard is a biological agent (in the case of this standard, poliovirus) that may cause illness or death in humans or animals upon exposure. Biorisk management committee: An independent review group for biorisk issues associated with the poliovirus facility.

CCID 50: A cell culture infectious dose that will infect 50% of the cell monolayers challenged with the defined inoculum. Calibration : Establishment of the relationship between the measurement provided by the instrument and the corresponding values of a known standard, allowing correction to improve accuracy. For example, laboratory equipment such as pipetting devices may need calibration periodically to ensure proper performance. Certification : The systematic, documented process to ensure systems perform in accordance with available certification standards or applicable validation guidance. National certification to this standard is expected to be performed once a year through responsible national oversight bodies. Closed system: Closed systems provide a complete physical barrier between infectious material and personnel . Closed systems must be validated and leak tested. Containment: The combination of physical design parameters and operational practices that protect personnel, the immediate work environment and the community from exposure to biological agents. The term \"biocontainment\" is also used in this context. Containment , primary : A contained workspace designed to provide protection to its operator, the laboratory environment and/or the work materials for activities where there is an aerosol hazard. Protection is achieved by segregation of the work from the main area of the laboratory and/or through Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale the use of controlled, directional airflow mechanisms. Primary containment devices include biological safety cabinets (BSCs), isolators, local exhaust ventilators and ventilated working spaces. Contingency planning : The preparation for a future event or circumstance regarded as likely to occur, or as influencing present action.

Formal design process : A structured and documented approach where the needs of the facility are determined through risk assessment. Fumigation : The process whereby one or more chemicals are applied in the gaseous or vaporized state to an enclosed space for the purpose of deconta minating the area and the items therein. Global Certification Commission (GCC): The term commonly used to refer to the Global Commission for the Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis, which has the responsibility to define the parameters and processes by which polio eradication will be certified, receive and review reports of the regional commissions , and issue a final report to the Director General of WHO certifying that global polio eradication has been achieved. Good microbiological practices and procedures (GMPP ): A basic laboratory code of practice applicable to all types of laboratory activities with biological agents, including general behaviours and aseptic techniques that should always be observed in the laboratory.

Needed poliovirus materials: Poliovirus materials deemed needed and worth storing to ensure the continuation of critical international and national functions, including Salk -IPV and Sabin- IPV production, the development and storage of oral polio virus vaccine stockpiles, vaccine quality assurance, diagnostic reagent production, virus diagnostic and reference functions, and crucial research, as determined by the respective NAC or other designated national authority . Organization: The legal entity responsible for the management of the poliovirus facility, such as a university, private company , or government agency. Penetrations: Openings through walls, floors , or ceilings to allow for mechanical services. Policy: Intentions and direction of an organiza tion as formally expressed by its top management. Poliovirus: A picornavirus consisting of three serotypes: 1, 2, and 3. Poliovirus serotypes are further subdivided into wild (circulating in nature) and Sabin strains (attenuated strains used for oral poliovirus vaccines). Polioviruses use CD155 as the primary cellular receptor. Poliovirus, wild: Wild polioviruses ar e naturally occurring isolates known or believed to have circulated persistently in the community. Vaccine- derived polioviruses (VDP Vs) are classified with wild polioviruses. VDPVs are rare strains of poliovirus that have genetically mutated from the strained contained in the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) . They are >0.6% (type 2) or >1% (types 1 and 3) divergent from the corresponding OPV strain in the complete VP1 genomic region[1] . Some isolates display >15% sequence diversity but are phylogenetically related to parental Sabin strains. They may have circulated in the community (cVDPV) or have replicated for prolonged periods in immunodeficient subjects (iVDPV) or be ambiguous and of unknown origin (aVDPV) . Attenuated strains not licensed for use as live vaccines (Cox/Lederle and Koprowski/Wistar series) are classified with wild polioviruses as their clinical properties are unproven. Wild poliovirus materials may be (a) infectious or (b) potentially infectious. (a) Poliovirus infectious materials, wild: These include: clinical materials from confirmed wild poliovirus infections; environmental sewage or water samples that have tested positive for the presence of wild polioviruses; cell culture isolates and reference strains of wild poliovirus; seed stocks and infectious materials from IPV production; infected animals or samples from such animals, including human poliovirus receptor transgenic mice; infectious viruses produced in the laboratory that have caps id sequences from wild polioviruses, unless demonstrably proven to be safer than Sabin strains. The safety of new derivatives containing wild poliovirus capsid sequences will be assessed by an expert panel convened by WHO , on the basis of comparison to ref erence Sabin strains for (i) degree and stability of attenuation; (ii) potential for person- to-person transmission; and (iii) neurovirulence in animal models; cells persistently infected with poliovirus strains whose capsid sequences are derived from Sabin /OPV strains. (b) Poliovirus potentially infectious materials, wild : These include: faecal or respiratory secretion samples and their derivatives (e.g. , stool suspensions, extracted nucleic acids, etc.) collected for any purpose in a time and geographic area of wild poliovirus (including VDPV) circulation; Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale products of such materials from poliovirus permissive cells or animals; uncharacterized enterovirus -like cell culture isolates from countries known or suspected to have circulating wild poliovirus or VDPV at the time of collection; respiratory and enteric virus stocks handled under conditions where poliovirus contamination or replication is possible; environmental samples (i.e. , concentrated sewage, wastewater ) collected from areas known or suspected to have circulating WPV or VDPV at the time of collection. Poliovirus nucleic acid : Full-length poliovirus RNA, cDNA, and total nucleic acid extracted from poliovirus infectious materials (e.g., a virus isolate) or potentially infectious materials (e.g., stool, respiratory specimen, sewage) using methods demonstrated to inactivate poliovirus, or synthesized full-length RNA /cDNA (e.g., cDNA clon e, synthetic transcript). Poliovirus nucleic acid can be handled outside poliovirus containment under the condition that these materials will not be introduced into polio- permissive cells or animals (as defined in GAPIV and the \"Guidance for non-poliovirus facilities to minimize risk of sample collections potentially infectious for polioviruses \") with or without transfection reagent . The use of poliovirus nucleic acids with polio- permissive cells that have been rendered and validated as non-polio permissive by techniques such as genetic engineering, etc. are not subject to these requirements. Poliovirus, Sabin (Sabin/OPV strains) : Attenuated poliovirus strains (approved for use in oral poliovirus vaccines by national regulatory authorities, principally Sabin strains) . Poliovirus, OPV- like: For the laboratory network not involved in manufacture, isolates consistent with a limited period of virus excretion or person- to-person transmission, demonstrating less than 1% difference from parent Sabin/OPV strains for poliovirus types 1 and 3, and less than 0.6% difference from the type 2 parent Sabin/OPV strain by full Viral Protein 1 sequence homology. The phenotype of clinical and environmental OPV -like isolates need not be determined as the great majority are assumed to be of low virulence. Sabin materials may be (a) infectious or (b) potentially infectious. The attenuated phenotype of viruses resulting from manufacture based on the Sabin/OPV seeds must be assured and cannot rely on the lack of sequence drift alone. (a) Poliovirus infectious materials, Sabin/OPV: These include: cell culture isolates and reference Sabin/OPV strains; seed stocks and live virus materials from Sabin/OPV production; environmental sewage or water samples that have tested positive for the presence of Sabin/OPV strains; faecal or respiratory secretion samples from recent Sabin/OPV recipients; infected animals or samples from such animals, including poliovirus receptor transgenic mice; derivatives produced in the laboratory that have capsid sequences from Sabin/OPV strains; cells persistently infected with poliovirus strains whose capsid sequences are derived from Sabin/OPV strains. (b) Poliovirus potentially infectious materials, Sabin/OPV : These include: faecal or respiratory secretion samples collected for any purpose in a time and geographic area of Sabin/ OPV use; products of such materials from poliovirus permissive cells or animals; respiratory and enteric virus stocks handled under conditions where Sabin/OPV strain contamination or replication is possible; environmental samples (i.e., concentrated sewage, wastewater) collected from areas known or suspected to have circulating Sabin/OPV at the time of collection. PVSRIPO: Neuro- ribosomal entry site (IRES) of human rhinovirus type 2. Regional Certification Commission (RCC): The term commonly used to refer to the Regional Commission for the Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis, which has been established in Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale each of the six WHO regions with responsibility to certify to the GCC that eradication has been achieved throughout all Member States of their region. Regulation : Government requirements and actions , based on laws, which govern specific activities. Risk: A combination of the probability of the occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. Risk assessment : A systematic process of gathering information and evaluating the likelihood and consequences of exposure to or release of workplace hazard(s) and determining the appropriate risk control measures to reduce the risk to an acceptable risk . This process involv es a team of personnel who have the knowledge, training and competence to ident ify, assess, control, and evaluate risks. The risk assessment parameters are outlined in Element 2- Risk Assessment and Control of Annex 1. S19: A hyper -attenuated, genetically stable poliovirus strain. Safeguards, Facility : Containment precautions and stipulations designed to minimize the facility - associated poliovirus risks of exposing and/or infecting populations. Safeguards, Immunization Coverage : The population immunization coverage consistent with minimizing the consequence of a poliovirus release from a poliovirus -essential containment facility.

Verification : Confirmation that a given item (product, process or system) satisfies the specified requirements. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale Introduction Launched in 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is the largest international public health effort ever undertaken. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of governments at all levels, countless hours of volunteer services , and the immunization of billions of children by health workers around the globe, wild poliovirus has now been eliminated from most countries worldwide. The requirements and guidance on poliovirus containment outlined in GAPIV have been developed to ensure that this monumental achievement in global health will not be undermined by an incident in a facility that handles poliovirus post-eradication. Purpose of GAPIV After certification of eradication and OPV cessation, facilities that store and/or work with poliovirus represent the most significant threat to maintaining global eradication. This standard describes the safe handling requirements and community safeguards for facilities that intend to retain WPV/VDPV and Sabin/OPV infectious materials (IM) as well as WPV potentially infectious materials ( PIM). This fourth edition of the Global Action Plan (GAP) aligns the safe handling and containment of poliovirus infecti ous and potentially infectious materials with the Polio Eradication Strategy 2022- 2026 and replaces the 2015 third edition (GAPIII). The GAP IV standard is an evolving document, subject to revisions as new information emerges relevant to achieving the appropriate balance between community risk and the systems and controls to manage that risk. The poliovirus -specific Biorisk Management Standard in Annex 1 provides the framework for facility certification based on the principles of a biorisk management system. This standard advises the facility to understand the risks associated with its activities and to manage those risks in ways acceptable to the national and international bodies responsible for the oversight of poliovirus containment . As such, risk assessment and control are a critical component for adequate application of this standard; additional guidance on biological risk assessment can be found in the Risk Assessment Monograph of the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition[2] . Ultimately, national authorities are responsible for ensuring the application of these risk management standards and principles in local circumstances . This standard should be used in conjunction with the other containment guidance and tools available on the GPEI webs ite, including the Containment Certification Scheme to support the WHO Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (CCS ) and the Guidance to minimize risks for facilities collecting, handling or storing materials potentially infectious for polioviruses ( PIM Guidance) [11]. While GAPIV addresses the requirements for facilities that intend to continue storing and/or working with poliovirus IM and WPV PIM, inventorying, destroying, and containing PIM that is not subject to this standard is also critical fo r maintaining containment. PIM includes respiratory, faecal, or environmental sewage samples, and derivatives of such, collected for any purpose in a time and geographic area of WPV/VDPV circulation or OPV use in the community (see Definitions) . Detailed guidance on the requirements regarding PIM identification, inventory, and handling can be found in the second edition of the PIM Guidance. Transition Period The overall allowable transition period from GAPIII, 2015 to GAPIV, 2022 is three years, from July 2022 through July 2025. G uidance on this transition period is provided in the Compliance Verification Activities During the Transition from GAPIII to GAPIV document available on the GPEI website. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale Summary of Changes Developments in polio eradication strategy, risk characterization, and vaccine technology have necessitated the revision of the third iteration of the WHO Global Action Plan and its annexes, published in 2015. Extensive efforts were undertaken to solicit feedback on GAPIII from a range of global poliovirus containment stakeholders and subject matter experts. The newly revised GAPIV incorporates updated guidance in line with international documents, aligns facility requirements with available evidence and emphasizes utilizing risk -based approaches for risk control that can be applied across the range of PEFs, which vary by location, size, and purpose. It is critical to note that the shift to a risk - and evidence- based approach does not alter the tolerance for minimal risk, but instead allows facilities to control their unique risks through mitigations that are locally relevant, proportionate and sustain able. Significant changes were made to both the structure and the contents of the standard, including the following: Restructuring of the document layout includ es removing former Annexes for cla rity and concision : Annex 2 and 3 of GAPIII have been combin ed into a single annex that designates strain -specific requirements, as needed; Annex 4 was superseded by the CCS and so has been removed; Annex 5 was removed in favour of reference to the LBM4; and Annex 6 was superseded by the PIM Guidance, 2 nd edition a nd so has been removed. Within the revised Annex 1 of GAPIV , the biorisk management system elements have been reorganized. General safety and human factors have been incorporated into Element 2 Risk Assessment and Control and Element 4 Competence and Trai ning, respectively, reducing the total number of elements to fourteen. The entire standard has been amended in accordance with decisions made by the CAG since publication of GAPIII , including guidance for poliovirus -non-essential facilities and containment requirements for novel poliovirus strains . References to CWA 15793 have been replaced with superseding international risk management doc uments , and relevant language has been harmonized with current containment requirements. In accordance with the shift to a risk -based approach, prescriptive titr e and vaccination requirements have been replaced with risk -based language. Exit shower requirements have been replaced with performance- based language that more generally applies to the range of PEFs. To improve understanding and implementation, primary, secondary and tertiary safeguards have been reclassified as facility , immunization coverage, and environmental safeguards. The requirement that PEFs must be located in areas with closed sewage systems with secondary or greater treatment of effluents has been removed, but facility locations must maximize the use of environmental features that reduce risk of onward transmission with approval by their national authorities . The requirement for effluent tre atment to be dedicated has been replaced with risk -based language that ensures mitigations are in place to prevent cross -contamination. Language on gaseous decontamination and backflow prevention has been modified. HEPA filtration of exhaust is required f or facilities handling both wild and Sabin poliovirus, unless alternatives mitigations are approved for small virus quantities. Guidance on inactivation and validation techniques as well as equipment decontamination has been bolstered. Requirements for BSC certification and labelling stored materials have been added. Facility specific requirements have been expanded to include considerations for retrofitting existing spaces. Language defining the containment perimeter, organizational r esponsibilities, animal care, storage conditions, and non- dedicated spaces has been updated. Emergency planning has been expanded to encourage the involvement of external agencies, implement surveillance following an incident, and report public health events using the IHR 2005 framework. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale New material has also been added to GAPIV. The activities of key poliovirus stakeholders are outlined to clarify their roles and interdependencies with other bodies for containment activities. Additional requirements describing primary containment needs as well as additional specific mitigation measures applicable to all PEFs, such as the requirement of a hands -free hand washing sink, have been included. The phased implementation of containment as described in GAPIII has been replaced by the inventory/destruction and containment requirements. All strains, WPV /VDPV and Sabin/OPV, are subject to the described inventory and destruction requirements. Containment requirements are determined by strain, and the pr ogression of containment requirements is determined by the Global Commission for the Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis (GCC) to allow for adaptability to the current status of eradication. The primary goal of thi s standard remains to be r isk elimination wherever possible, through material destruction and the reduction of facilities handling poliovirus , and appropriate biorisk management where elimination is not possible. The GAPIV standard sets forth measures to minimize the PEF- associated risk with polioviruses , a critical element towards ensuring the safety of PEFs and public health as the world nears eradication . Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale Rationale The progression of poliovirus eradication and containment is a dynamic process that continues to face numerous challenges as the world moves towards becoming polio- free. Despite these challenges, immense progress has been made and continues to be made in a dvancing the Polio Eradication Strategy 2022- 2026 [3].[3]. Not only does a continued focus on containment help ensure the globe is ready to transition to a post -eradication world when the time comes, pre- eradication containment may also prevent facility -associated releases that could delay and undermine eradication. Global Eradication Status The Polio Eradication Strategy 2022- 2026: Delivering on a Promise set the goal of a polio- free world by 2026 [3]. Achieving this goal requires: (i) permanently interrupting all poliovirus transmission in endemic countries ; and (ii) stopping circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) transmission and preventing outbreaks of cVDPV in polio- free regions . The Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) declared wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) eradicated in 2015 and type 3 (WPV3) eradicated in 2019. Worldwide WPV type 1 (WPV1) cases have dropped considerably and have been limited to a small number of countries. Despite these achievements, the continuing circulation of WPV1 and outbreaks of cVDPV present significant obstacles to overcome before total eradication can be reached. The first step towards eliminating cVDPV2 occurred in 2016 when 155 OPV -using countries successfully from using trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bivalent OPV (bOPV for types 1 & 3) as part of their immunization programs. 1 The switch, combined with delays in availability of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), led to a decline in immunity to poliovirus type 2. In this context, outbreaks of cVDPV2 have occurred in at -risk regions across the globe, with cVDPV2 cases tripling between 2019 and 2020. Currently, cVDPV2 presents as great a public health threat as the ongoing circulation of WPV1 in endemic countries. Outbreaks of cVDPV1 and cVDPV3 remain low, and their instance can be traced to poor OPV coverage. To better respond to ongoing and future cVDPV2 outbreaks, novel OPV type 2 (nOPV2) was developed as a more genetically stable version of monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2). Clinical trials of nOPV2 show that it provides comparable safety and immunogenicity to mOPV2 against poli ovirus while being significantly less likely to revert to neurovirulence and induce v accine- associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) or seed new cVDPV2 outbreaks [4-6]. In November 2020, WHO's Prequalifi cation program issued an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) recommendation for nOPV2 to enable its rapid availability for responding to cVDPV2 outbreak s [7]. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization has further endorsed that nOPV2 become the vaccine of choice in response to cVDPV2 outbreak s based on a review of data from the initial use period for the vaccine's safety, immunogenicity, and genetic stability [8]. Currently, bOPV is the vaccine of choice to respond to any WPV1/VDPV1 and VDPV3 outbreaks, while tOPV or mOPV2 /nOPV2 is the choice for responding to type 2 outbreaks. Clinical trials for nOPV for types 1 and 3 (nOPV1 and nOPV3) began in 2021 and are ongoing , but there is currently no plan to replace bOPV in routine immunization programmes [9]. After OPV cessation, a combination of type- specific nOPV and IPV will be used to respond to any WPV /VDPV outbreak. Currently, bOPV is the vaccine of choice to respond to any WPV1/VDPV1 and VDPV3 outbreaks, while tOPV or mOPV2 /nOPV2 is the choice for responding to type 2 outbreaks. Clinical trials for nOPV for types 1 and 3 (nOPV1 and nOPV3) began in 2021 and are ongoing , but there is currently no plan to replace bOPV in routine immunization programmes [9]. After OPV cessation, a combination of type- specific nOPV and IPV will be used to respond to any WPV /VDPV outbreak. Achieving global consensus to stop using OPVs will require international assurance that the transmission of wild and vaccine- derived poliovirus has been interrupted and that affordable, safe and effective IPVs are available . Effective m easures must be in place to control potential outbreaks from 1 At the time of publication, tOPV is still used by several countries when performing supplementary immunization activities combatting co -circulation of multiple poliovirus serotypes. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale undetected or newly emerged cVDPV , mitigate the risk of community spread of iVDPV viruses , and minimize the risk from facility -associated reintroduction of wild or Sabin/OPV polioviruses [10-12]. Containment Rational e When WPV/VDPV circulation is interrupted, interest in immunization against polio is expected to decline as the cost of immunization may no longer be justified by its public health benefit. As a result, population susceptibility will increase in many parts of the world. When the use of OPV stops, some countries will maintain high population coverage with IPV, other countries will have suboptimal IPV coverage, and still others m ay discontinue all national polio immunization activities. Given this decline in population immunity , any facility -associated reintroduction of poliovirus risks re-establishing poliovirus transmission and undermining the public health achievement of polio eradicatio n [13]. Given these substantial risks, all regions should seek both to minimize the number of poliovirus - essential facilities (PEF) and to destroy all infectious and potentially infectious poliov irus materials unless facilities must perform critical functions . Most countries will have no need to retain live polioviruses after eradication because polio will pose a lesser threat to public health. Those that forgo retaining poliovirus materials are helping the global community achieve and safeguard eradication. Facility -associated risks in these countries can be eliminated by a thorough nationwide search for and destruction of all infectious and potentially infectious poliovirus materials . Some countries will host a limited number of PEFs that serve critical functions in global health, including vaccine production, storage of OPV stockpiles, vaccine quality assurance, diagnostic reagent production, virus diagnostic and reference functions , and crucial research, as determined by their NAC with oversight from the CWG . As total eradication nears, poliovirus activities deemed critical will be subject to increased international oversight . Given the risk of reintroduction from these facilities, any facility that will retain poliovirus for any reason post -eradication must adhere to the biorisk management princip les outlined in this standard to ensure that a single accident does not undermine decades of effort in global health. The progression of poliovirus eradication and containment is a dynamic process that continues to face numerous challenges as the world moves towards becoming polio- free. Despite these challenges, immense progress has been made and continues to be made in advancing the Polio Eradication Strategy 2022- 2026 [3]. National authorities and facilities should not slow, postpone, or halt containment and destruction efforts \u2014inventory, destruction, containment, and certification can and should occur in advance of eradication for all strains of poliovirus when ever and wherever possible. Not only does a continued focus on containment help ensure the globe is ready to transition to a post - eradication world when the time comes, pre- eradication containment may also prevent facility - associated releases th at could delay and undermine eradication. Facilities that continue to retain live poliovirus material s must ensure that the risks of both accidental exposure and intentional release are extremely low and develop appropriate mechanisms to recognize and adequately deal with such incidents. These conditions can be met by developing and implementing a robust biorisk management system based on the requirements outlined in Annex : Biorisk . This system should adopt a risk -based approach to assessing PEFs that considers the specific facility, location, and work being performed, ensuri ng that controls put in place are both appropriate and effective. This adaptive approach to risk control allow s for the application of appropriate safeguards, and, by incorporating site- specific considerations, decreases the risk of exposure or release. In dependent review of the risks and benefits of retaining live poliovirus material should occur at the national level based on international guidelines, and countries should favour destruction of poliovirus materials wherever possible. Destroying unnecessar y poliovirus materials, minimizing the number of PEFs , and implementing strong biorisk management programs at PEFs are each critical steps to ensuring global containment standards can be met and successfully maintained. Ensuring eradication requires that all countries, with national, regional , and international oversight, commit to these critical efforts . Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale Poliovirus Facility -Associated R isks Facilities that continue to retain live poliovirus material must assess and control the unique risks associated with the storage and/or handling of poliovirus as the world nears eradication. Ingestion is the natural route of transmission for poliovirus and presents the highest risk for facility personnel as this may occur via contact with contaminated fomites, splash to the oral mucosa or by inhalation of large droplets, some of which will deposit in the pharyngeal region. Immunization with OP V or IPV prevents disease, but immunization neither fully inhibits asymptomatic poliovirus infection nor prevents reinfection of the gut. Estimated infectious doses (ID 50) by ingestion, based on studies with infants and children, are \u00b1101 CCID 50 for wild p olioviruses and \u00b1103 CCID 50 for Sabin strains. Immunized adult personnel are likely more resistant than immunologically na\u00efve children, but resistance is dose related and may be overcome by larger ingested doses. Droplets created by sprays, spills and the splash of poliovirus cell cultures (up to 108 CCID 50) and concentrates (1011 CCID 50) constitute one of the highest personnel exposure risks (Figure 1) [14] . While biosafety measures continue to evolve and improve, workplace acquired infections still occur. Several literature reviews and surveys of workplace acquired infections and exposures (laboratory, clinical and vaccine manufacturing settings) found the most commonly identified routes of exposure to infectious agents in the f acility environment are parenteral inoculation, spills and splashes to the skin or mucous membranes, ingestion, and animal bites or scratches. These incidents comprise approximately 20% of clearly attributable causes of exposure [15 -19]. In the context of poliovirus exposure, any splashes and spills that may lead to accidental ingestion, including contamination of the hands, may become a route for worker infection. While the respiratory tract does not appear to be a significant portal of entry for poliovirus, whether small particle aerosols deposited in the lower airways may be cleared to the pharyngeal region through mucociliary transport and infect the alimentary t ract is an unresolved question. Antibodies acquired through immunization greatly reduce infection risks from injection or breaks in skin or mucous membranes. Identified instances of documented workplace acquired infections and exposures for all infectious agents have concluded that up to 80% of exposures may occur via the aerosol route [15- 19]. Polioviruses under moist conditions in clinical or environmental samples can survive indefinitely in the laboratory freezer (< -20 \u00b0C), for many months in the refrigerator and for weeks on the bench top at ambient temperatures (18). The virus is inactivated by dehydration, heat (>50 \u00b0C) or treatment with dilute solutions of formaldehyde or bleach at appropriate concentrations. In the poliovirus facility, poliovirus content of common materials ranges from a mean of 10 3.7 CCID 50/g (Sabin) to 104.3 in cell culture harvests, and 1011 CCID 50/ml in concentrates in vaccine production facilities [14] . Sabin strains are less pathogenic than wild and have lower secondary infection rates, but all three Sabin virus types have been linked to vaccine- derived poliovirus (VDPV) outbreaks. Peer -reviewed research has examined facility -associated release of poliovirus and poliovirus workplace acquired infection and incidents and underscores the need for heightened biosafety and biosecurity practices, comprehensive risk assessment and control strategies, appropriate facility design and operations and emergency plans [20, 21] . Individuals and facility workers fully vaccinated against poliovirus are stil l capable of becoming infected and shedding live virus, presenting a risk of asymptomatic community spread following a laboratory acquired infection [1] . This is of particular concern because most laboratory acquired infections are not able to be attributed to specific incidents identified in the lab, and thus infections may occur without the workers realizing they have been exposed [22]. In addition to exposure from workers infected due to their work with poliovirus, community members may be exposed to infectious agents from the facility through: workers' contaminated skin or clothing; the release of contaminated air; contaminated effluents and wastewater recovered from secondary sewage treatment plants; the uncontrolled transport of infectious material; solid waste transported to landfills; contaminated equipment or materials removed from th e facility; the escape of infected animals; and a theft or deliberate release of infectious agents from a facility. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Rationale Exposure risks through the last four routes are low for poliovirus facilities that adhere to international regulations for the transport of infectious substances, those outlined in the Good Laboratory Practice handbook and the WHO guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice. Risks are also likely low for the inhalation of contaminated air effluent where facilities maintain low relative humid ity environments and exhaust air away from direct human exposure. Exposure risks through the ingestion of effluents range between high and low, depending on the poliovirus content of facility effluent, sewerage system size and integrity, and the potential for human consumption. Risks of community exposure are highest through facility personnel unknowingly contaminated or infected with poliovirus. Effective poliovirus risk management is achieved by the careful assessment of exposure risks, the implementati on of risk -appropriate worker protection measures, administrative, and environmental controls as well as the operation of a facility designed to minimize the risk of poliovirus contamination and dissemination to the community. The main risk is the infection of personnel by ingestion. Infection through inhalation is a conceivable risk pathway but has not been demonstrated and infection through parenteral exposure such as needlestick is unlikely in immunized individuals. Figure 1: Estimated poliovirus conten t and infectious dose 2 2 Estimated infectious doses (ID 50) are based on studies with naive infants and children. Immunized adult laboratory workers are likely to be much more resistant than immunologically na\u00efve children. However, dose-related resistance may be overcome by ingesting sufficient poliovirus particles. 1014 Virus content (CCID 50) Sabin PV Wild Estimated infectious dose (ID 50) Pharyngeal (per swab) Stool (per g) Vaccine concentrates (per ml) Cell culture (per ml) 1012 1010 108 106 104 102 0 Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Roles and Activities Roles and Activities of Poliovirus Containment Stakeholders To achieve global polio eradication and sustain a polio -free world, collaboration is key among global, regional, national , and subnational levels.

Its goal is to complete the eradication and containment of all wil d, vaccine- related and Sabin polioviruses, such that no child ever again suffers paralytic poliomyelitis. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Roles and Activities Figure 2. Stakeholder Roles in Activities with Inter dependencies Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Strategy Strategy Risk Elimination in Poliovirus -Non-Essential Facilit ies Risk elimination in poliovirus -non-essential facilities starts with the identification of: 1. infectious and potential ly infectious WPV /VDPV materials ; 2. infectious and potentially infectious Sabin/OPV materials , as described below . Once these materials are identified, risk is controlled if these materials are destroyed or transferred to a PEF. PEFs will minimize the amount of poliovirus samples they retain and destroy any poliovirus samples that are no longer needed to eliminate the risk that these samples present. Destruction applies to all materials potentially containing any type or strain of WPV/VDPV or Sabin/OPV poliovirus (a) facilities that previously work ed with polioviruses [25] or (b) in non- polio virus facilities retaining clinical materials potentially infected with WPV/VDPV or Sabin/OPV viruses. Poliovirus PIM exists in non -poliovirus facilities worldwide, including clinical facilities, repositories, enteric disease research facilities, and a variety of other locations. Successful identification and destruction or containment of PIM is critical to ensuring that the ri sk of facility -associated infection or release is minimized. The PIM Guidance outlines the steps required for identifying PIM. To control risk of a facility -associated infection or release, PIM should be destroyed whenever possible, and the use of PIM subs tituted with other non- poliovirus materials. Facilities handling PIM must meet the requirements outlined in the PIM G uidance. Successful global risk control requires each country to robustly prohibit retention and subsequent acquisition of poliovirus materials in all poliovirus -non-essential facilities according to global recommendations [3]. Risk Control and Biorisk Management for Poliovirus -Essential Facilities A robust biorisk management system is critica l for maintaining containment in facilities that store and/or work with polioviruses. A loss of containment and breach in biosafety at a PEF can lead to a n outbreak of poliovirus that could then threaten global eradic ation. The primary way to prevent such a scenario is effective biorisk management at PEFs , which minimi zes the likelihood of a loss of containment and quickly recognizes one if it occurs . If a loss of containment does occur, immunization coverage and environmental safeguards mitigate the likelihood of re-establishing poliovirus transmission in a region, which would threaten eradication. In coordination with NACs, designated PEFs control ris k through the implementation and fulfilment of : 1. polio- specific containment requirements to reduce the likelihood of pers onnel exposure and release of polioviruses from PEFs (facility safeguards) ; 2. requirements for population immunization coverage to safeguard against re -establishing community spread in the event of a releas e of polioviruses from PEFs (immunization coverage safeguards ); 3. requirements for environmental control measures to minimize the likelihood of community exposures in the event of a release from PEFs (environmental safeguards) ; A sustainable biorisk management system will utilize control strategies that are commensurate with the facility -associated risks, including both the degree of risk and the specific risks generated by the work undertaken. The risk assessment process is clearly described for all stakeholders and utilizes the strateg ies for risk reduction in choosing suitable control measures [26]. Controls implemented must consider local conditions to ensure their efficacy . A variety of controls measures may be utilized, but the expected outcome is clearly defined and standardi zed according to the requirements outlined in this document. Risks and threats, including security risks, vary across the regions of the world and must be assessed based on local circumstances . The local risk assessment will include population immunization status to evaluate vulnerability to reintroduction of poliovirus into the community and threat analysis to assess biosecurity risks, among many other factors [2]. Facility safeguards for containment reduce the likelihood of accidental or intentional poliovirus release from a PEF and are specified in the Biorisk Management Standard for Poliovirus -essential Facilities Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Strategy Holding Wild and/or Sabin/OPV Poliovirus Materials in the Annex of this document . Key elements include : Management at the facility who practise continual risk assessment and strict observance of biosafety and biosecurity procedures . The containment facility, which incorporates appropriate design, construction, and operation principles , thereby addressing identified biorisk . A worker health programme, which can reduce the risk of infection in the facility and intra- or extra- household transmission should infection occur [27, 28] . Contingency plans for potential virus release or exposure, which specify actions in alignment with the \" Public health manag ement of facility related exposure to live poliovirus guidance\" [29]. All waste from facilities potentially containing live poliovirus will be inactivated prior to release through adequate and validat ed inactivation procedures. In facilities without a n effluent treatment plant, in most cases an effluent decontamination system, this would normally be achieved by applying heat or chemicals as part of a validated treatment process. Under no circumstances should raw poliovirus containing effluents be discharged to drains, unless the effluent treatment plant has been designed and validated to handle such effluents, effectively acting as part of the primary containment system. Immunization coverage safeguards minimize the consequences of a poliovirus release into the community from a PEF retaining WPV /VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV and consist of: Implementing a routine immunization schedule with a minimum of two IPV doses and goal of three doses ( IPV2; full or fractional, standalone , or in comb ination vaccines) , with the first dose administered at four months and the second dose administered at least four months after the first dose [30]. Maintaining high immunization coverage with 90% IPV2 coverage in infants in the area surrounding the PEF and maintaining the Global Vaccine Action Plan target coverage in that area [31]. The geographic size of the area surrounding the PEF that must be covered by these vaccination data will be determined through risk assessment by the respective NAC . Immunization coverage can be presented as multinational, national, or subnational data, as appropriate for the geographic area and demonstrated in the application for containment certification. This risk assessment must be renewed triennially as a part of the containment certification cycle . Prior to all OPV cessation, immunization coverage data can be presented as 90% coverage of IPV1 to meet this crit erion. After OPV cessation, only IPV 2 coverage will be accepted to meet this criteri on. Having an outbreak plan specifying response to containment breach and conduct outbreak simulation exercises . Environmental safeguards will maximize the use of environmental features that reduce risk of onward transmission (e.g., areas with closed sewage systems with a minimum of secondary treatment of effluents, with low population density, with demonstrated low faecal -oral disease transmiss ion). In coordination with the NAC, necessary environmental safeguards ( e.g., frequent environmental testing for poli ovirus to detect a facility -associated release or silent outbreaks in vaccinated communities) must be implemented based on a site- specific risk assessment . Facility , immunization coverage and environmental safeguards are required for PEFs that handle and store either WPV/VDPV or Sabin/OPV IM as well as WPV PIM ( Table 1). Additional safeguards should be considered based on the nature of the PEF's work , particularly the types of procedures , volumes , and tit re concentrations . The nature of these safeguards is determined by the PEF in coordination with the NAC based on the site- specific risk assessment and be outlined in the facility's application for certification under the CCS. Wherever possible, PEFs should destroy poliovirus samples that no longer need to be retained and substitute Sabin/OPV or other non-infectious strains for wild poliovirus strains . These actions reduce the risk for infection at the community level if a breach of containment occurs and minimize the consequences of such a breac h if transmi ssion was recognized in time [28]. Compliance with GAPIV will be assessed as a part of the containment certification cycle outlined in the CCS . A containment certificate is issued to a designated facility following the successful Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Strategy completion of an initial full scope certification audit by the respective NAC, in consultation with the GCC. Annual audits are required thereafter followed by r egular triennial recertification , per the CCS. National certification provides assurance that the required safeguards are met . Table 1. Required Safeguards for PEFs Handling Wild and Sabin Polioviruses Facility Safeguards Operator protection Required Decontamination of materials/equipment Required Effluent decontamination Required Air/exhaust treatment Required Immunization Coverage Safeguards Pre-OPV IPV1 or IPV2 coverage Post-OPV cessation 90% IPV2 coverage Environmental Safeguards Environmental controls in place to minimize onward transmission risk Required Containment Requirements for Novel Poliovirus Strain s The CAG provides recommendations on the risks posed by novel strains of poliovirus , which includes recommendations for the evaluation of improved safety of these strains to determine the containment requirements for their storage and handling. Several specific poliovirus strains have been identified as presenting a lower risk profile than WPV and Sabin/OPV . The handling of these strains outside the containment requirements of this standard may be permitted in accordance with the CAG 's recommendation, but they are still subject to national inventory requirements and the PIM Guidance. Based on available safety data, CAG recommended a temporary waiver for the production and use, according to the specific terms of usage provided, of nOPV2 outside of GAPI V containment conditions , although it is currently still subject to inventory requirements and the PIM Guidance [32- 34]. Facilities will be expected to engage in the CCS and adhere to GAPIV containment requirements at the expiration of the waiver. The CAG's full assessment of these strains \u2014including nOPV, S19, and PVSRIPO \u2014and their containment requirements can be found on the GPEI website. Entities may submit to CAG , in coordination with NAC (where available), request s for review of specific strains and work plans for additional exemptions. On the recommendation of the CAG, t he criteria for the evaluation of improved safety of novel poliovirus strains to determine containment requirements for their storage and handling will include but are not limited to the following : A. Novel poliovirus strain properties 1. Genetic stability to loss of attenuation - conditions a. Theoretical b. Cell culture (e.g., serial passage) c. Animal studies (e.g., single, multiple passage) d. Characterization (phenotype, genotype) 2. Neurovirulence - degree of attenuation a. Theoretical Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Strategy b. Cell culture c. Animal studies i. TgPVR (Transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus ) mice ii. Non- human primates 3. Replicative fitness - proxy for infectiousness a. Cell culture yiel d (single cycle; infectivity measure) b. Animal studies (e.g., shedding) 4. Transmissibility - a proxy of which is 'duration and amount of shedding' 5. * Data from human studies (if available) should be included when performing the risk assessments of such strains. B. Proposed use of the novel poliovirus strain 1. The impact of proposed use of these novel and related poliovirus strains on the containment requirements must be considered - any risk assessment of novel poliovirus strains must include an assessment of the risk associated with the intended use of the strains. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Inventory , Destruction and Containment Inventory , Destruction and Containment The previous iteration of the Global Action Plan outlined a progression of containment aligned with WPV2 -specific eradication as it was projected to develop. Since that time, WPV3 has also been declared eradicated by the GCC, another landmark achievement i n the progression towards global eradication. However, the emergence of multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks worldwide after tOPV withdrawal has greatly complicated the envisioned progression towards type- specific containment. Outbreaks of cVDPV2 that necessitate the use of OPV2 for supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) generate new poliovirus type 2 infectious and potentially infectious materials in samples collected from these regions. This dynamic nature of eradication demands a similarly flexible and adaptable approach to containment progression. This Global Action Plan comprises two main lines of effort that should be progressing concurrently: Inventory and destruction of poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials Containment of poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials that are not destroyed Inventory and destruction are dynamic and ongoing processes that apply to all regions for all strains and types. Facilities are encouraged to destroy any identified poliovir us infectious or potentially infectious materials whenever possible to minimize potential sources of facility -associated reintroduction. Containment applies to all countries that wish to retain poliovirus and/or poliovirus materials as eradication progress es. Individual countries that choose to retain poliovirus materials are encouraged to institute national containment policies in line with the containment requirements for all poliovirus materials in advance of final eradication and containment whenever possible. A proactive approach to containment will ensure that the risk of facility -associated exposure post -eradication is minimized. Details on how the se lines of effort apply to poliovirus containment are outlined in Table 2 below .Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Inventory, Destruction and Containment Table 2. Scope of Inventory , Destruction and Containment Efforts Line of Effort Component Applicable Facilities Timeline Justification Applicable Materials Inventory and Destruction Continual Assessment All locations where poliovirus IM or PIM may be found Ongoing effort for all facilities Ensures that no poliovirus infectious material or PIM is unaccounted for All poliovirus IM and PIM Validation All locations where poliovirus IM or PIM may be found Ongoing effort for all facilities Ensures that no poliovirus infectious material or PIM is unaccounted for All poliovirus IM and PIM Containment Establishment of Authorities Countries that wish to house PEFs Before 'Strain -Specific Containment' can begin for countries housing PEFs Ensure that national authorities and containment certification procedures are in place Any contained poliovirus IM and WPV PIM to be stored, worked with, or otherwise manipulated Strain -Specific Containment PEFs and designated facilities As containment efforts progress for a given poliovirus strain Ensures that PEFs institute appropriate ongoing safeguards for containment of poliovirus material and/or PIM Contained strains of poliovirus IM and WPV PIM (Table 4) Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Inventory, Destruction and Containment Inventory and Destruction To ensure Inventory and Destruction, countries shall satisfy the Continual Assessment and Validation components . An integral aspect of Continual Assessment is the national inventory of biomedical and clinical facilities that may possess infectious or potentially infectious poliovirus materials and the survey of those materials, including nOPV , S19 and other relevant strains. Maintaining this inventory is an ongoing effort for all WHO regions and all strains. It is also a dynamic process; facilities can and should be added and/or removed from the inventories as they obtain, transfer , and destroy samples. A successful national inventory is maintained through effective communication and outreach to all biomedical and clinical facilities in the country, proactive identification of facilities that may house poliovirus, and the regular survey of potentially affected facilities. National authorities (i.e., NPCC) are encouraged to validate inventories of PIM and poliovir us infectious materials to ensure inventory reports are complete and accurate. Both maintaining the national facility inventory and providing annual updates to each country's RCC are the responsibility of the relevant national authorit ies (i.e., NPCC , NCC). Due to the changing nature of eradication efforts, including active VDPV outbreaks, the maintenance of national inventories will continue until after global eradication, at which time the GCC may approve changes to the national inventory process. The V alidation component of Inventory and Destruction involves assessment of facilities' compliance with national poliovirus policies and regulations, including validating the status of poliovirus materials and timelines for compliance. Destruction of unneeded poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials utilizing a validated process will be emphasized by the relevant national authority for all facilities identified in the national inventory, and, as eradication progresses, the need for retention of these materials will be continually assessed. The national biomedical community must be notified that as global eradication is achieved, possession of poliovirus materials of any strain will only be permitted at certified PEFs . A summary of the requirements for Continual Assessment and Validation are outlined below and in Table 3. Continual Assessment Countries shall: Generat e, update and maintain a national inventory of facilities that possess WPV/VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV infectious or potentially infectious materials and novel poliovirus strains on a continual basis . Provide annual updates to the RCC of the national inventory of facilities that possess WPV/VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV IM or PIM and other novel poliovirus strains. Establish national contingency and emergency response plans for responding to a potential WPV/VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV exposure, release or outbreak . Request that all facilities destroy any unneeded WPV/VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV infectious or potentially infectious materials and other novel poliovirus strains through a validated process and continually reassess the necessity for retention of such materials . Validation Countries shall: Request that facilities designated to become PEFs submit plans for compliance with the CCS . Request that all facilities adopt the requirements outlined in the PIM Guidance. Request that all facilities that are likely to inves tigate new suspected poliovirus cases or receive faecal or respiratory samples from countries recently using Sabin/OPV or with cVDPV adopt: o Safe and secure working practices as outlined in the PIM Guidance. o A policy to destroy (utilizing a validated process) or transfer to a PEF all identified poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials. Notify the national biomedical community that retention of WPV /VDPV IM or PIM and/or Sabin/OPV IM will only be permitted at certified PEFs and retention of Sabin PIM will only be permitted at facilities that comply with the requirements outlined in the PIM G uidance . Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Inventory, Destruction and Containment Table 3. Country Requirements for Inventory and Destruction Line of Effort Component Requirements Inventory and Destruction Continual Assessment Generate, update, and maintain a national inventory of poliovirus possessing facilities Provide annual updates to the RCC of the national inventory Establish national contingency and emergency response plans for poliovirus release Request facilities destroy all unneeded poliovirus and/or PIM Validation Request all facilities adopt the PIM Guidance Request all facilities with poliovirus and/or PIM enter into the containment certification process Notify the national biomedical community that retention of poliovirus materials will only be allowed at PEFs or in compliance with the PIM Guidance Request that all poliovirus -non-essential facilities investigating new poliovirus cases and associated surveillance or receiving samples from countries recently using OPV or with cVDPV adopt safe practices outlined in the PIM Guidance and a destruction/transfer policy. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Inventory, Destruction and Containment Containment To ensure the Containment line of effort , countries shall satisfy the Establish ment of Authorities and Strain -Specific Containment components . Each country that wishes to retain poliovirus infectious and/or potentially infectious materials post -eradication must house such materials within a PEF and is required to designate a NAC to oversee containment efforts in the country. Strain -specific containment requirements are tied to progress towards global eradication. The requirements for OPV storage arise from the containment requirements for each respective strain and are a part of Strain- Specific Containment . To allow for a transition period in w hich countries are encouraged to work towards fulfilling containment requirements prior to their enforcement, the status of Strain -Specific Containment for each strain can be classified as in 'transition' or in 'full effect' (Table 4). When in transition, countries are in the process of enacting the requirements of that stage, whereas when in full effect , the country has enacted and is actively enforcing all requirements of that stage. In anticipation of eradication, individual countries and facilities are encouraged to enact the s train-specific containment requirements as early as possible and before they are deemed to be in full effect. This will allow countries to shift to be compliant with post -eradication containment requirements easily when the time comes, and pre- eradication containment may also prevent facility -associated releases that could delay and undermine the progress of eradication. As these response efforts are ongoing, the current status of containment requirements for each applicable strain of poliovirus can be found in Table 4. Though WPV types 2 and 3 have been declared eradicated, the world currently faces unprecedented challenges with the emergence of cVDPV outbreaks and ongoing WPV1 circulation in endemic countries. These new outbreaks unexpectedly complicated the envisioned progression of containment and did not fit into the previous, rigid framework. To allow for flexibility in enacting containment requirements in the face of challenges moving forward, containment requirements have been classified as in transition to enable affected countries to adequately respond to the situation on the ground. This allows countries who have been and are still responding to active outbreaks to collect samples, manufacture and distribute OPV, and continue to respond to their current public health emergencies without having to operate outside of the requirements of this standard. The progression of containment stages is a decision that will be made by the GCC upon receiving annual reports from the RCC of each region that include the regional status of the sustained level of immunization, surveillance, poliovirus containment and risk assessment . The GCC will determine the standing status of the strain-specific containment effort s on an annual basis, either affirming the current status is unchanged or advancing the containment status from ' transition' to 'full effect' as needed for each type and/or strain. This system enables flexibility in determining the requirements for containm ent to reflect the dynamic nature of eradication. Moreover, this system will allow for containment requirements to be considered ' in transition' for a period determined by the GCC as necessary for regions to meet containment requirements in a reasonable ti meframe. As different regions will progress towards eradication and Strain -Specific Containment at different rates, countries are encourage d to enact containment requirements in advance of the GCC global status determination whenever possible. The emerge nce of ongoing VDPV outbreaks has greatly complicated the progression of containment, and thus , VDPVs of a given strain may be classified by the GCC in a different containment status than the corresponding WPV strain. This separation is to ensure that regions are able to adequately respond to public health emergencies in their countries without being in violation of this standard. However , the two present similar risk profiles for a facility -associated release in regions without VDPV circulation. Though the global containment requirements for a strain -specific VDPV may be considered in 'transition', regions without VDPV circulation are strongly encouraged to handle those materials at the same containment status as the corresponding WPV strain. Once enacted, c ontainment requirements for a given strain will not be reversed but may be temporarily suspended in specific regions where a decision by WHO has been made to use OPV to respond to emerging or re- emerging WPV/VDPV out break s. A regional suspension of containment requirements does not represent a suspension of containment requirements worldwide. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Inventory, Destruction and Containment A summary of the requirements for Establishment and Strain- Specific Containment are listed below and in Table 5 . Establishment of Authorities Countries that wish to retain poliovirus infectious or potentially infectious materials post -eradication shall: Weigh the risks and benefits of retaining poliovirus in- country and the responsibilities inherent in complying wit h the crucial facility, immunization coverage, and environmental safeguards. Designate a NAC that will certify PEFs against the requirements of this standard in accordance with the CCS . Enable NACs to establish national certification procedures compliant w ith the requirements for WPV/VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV retention as outlined in this standard. Establish a mechanism to ensure the NAC has access to necessary information on immunization coverage and environmental safeguards . Table 4. Strain -Specific Status for Progression toward Full Containment Strain Containment Status Type 1 WPV 1 Transition VDPV 1 Transition Sabin 1/OPV1 Transition Type 2 WPV 2 Full Effect VDPV 2 Transition Sabin 2/OPV 2 Transition Type 3 WPV3 Transition VDPV 3 Transition Sabin 3/OPV3 Transition Transition= countries and facilities shall work towards implementing containment requirements Full effect= countries and facilities are compliant with containment requirements Transition to Full Containment When the containment status for a poliovirus strain is classified as in 'transition, ' countries retaining that given strain shall work towards implementing the containment requirements below as early as possible. D esignated facilities shall formally engage in the CCS mechanism through their respective NAC to be certified as meeting all biorisk management criteria outlined in this standard. Because all strains are now considered in 'transition', f acilities are encouraged to apply for certification collectivel y for all strains they plan to retain post-eradication. This transition period is intended to give countries and facilities time to become compliant with this document, by engaging in the CCS, prior to the containment requirements being in full effect. Countries that wish to retain poliovirus infectious or potentially infectious materials post -eradication while transitioning to full containment for a given strain shall: Implement annual national certification procedures compliant with the requirements for WPV/VDPV and Sabin/OPV retention as outlined in th is Biorisk Management Standard and in accordance with the CCS . Assess designated facilities against the requirements for WPV /VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV retention set forth in this standard through national certification procedures . Assess compliance with the required immunization coverage and environmental safeguards and document as part of the CCS . Require that all facilities that are unable to meet the retention requirements for WPV /VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV either destroy their poliovirus materials or transfer them to PEFs . Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Inventory, Destruction and Containment Require all p oliovirus -non-essential facilities that will investigate new suspected poliovirus cases and associated surveillance or receive faecal or respiratory samples from recent Sabin/O PV-using countries adopt both: o Safe and secure working practices as outlined in the PIM Guidance. o A policy to destroy or transfer all poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials, as outlined in the GPLN guidance paper 1 for safe handling and storage of poliovirus [23]. Containment in Full E ffect When the containment status for a poliovirus strain is classified as in 'full effect,' countries retaining that given strain shall meet the containment requirements listed below . Designated facilities shall be accepted into the CCS as PEFs , maintain containment certification per the biorisk management criteria outlined in this standard, and operat e within the terms of the certificate throughout the certification cycle . Countries that wish to house PEFs and retain poliovirus infectious or pot entially infectious material after the declaration of full effect containment for a given strain shall: Maintain annual national certification procedures compliant with the requirements for WPV/VDPV and Sabin/OPV retention as outlined in th is Biorisk Manag ement Standard and in accordance with the CCS. Reassess PEFs against the requirements for WPV /VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV retention set forth in this standard through national certification procedures . Ensure continued compliance with the required immunization coverage and environmental safeguards and document as part of the CCS. Prohibit the handling and storage of WPV /VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV infectious materials outside of PEFs . All poliovirus material must be destroyed or transferred to a PEF . Require all p oliovirus -non-essential facilities that will investigate new suspected poliovirus cases and associated adopt both: o Safe and secure working practices as outlined in the PIM Guidance. o A policy to destroy or transfer all poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials , as outlined in the GPLN guidance paper 1 for safe handling and storage of poliovirus [23]. Recall and either destroy or contain at a certified PEF all Sabin/OPV stocks nationwide. Require the storage and replenishment of OPV stockpiles (frozen bulk and finished product) be performed under the required containment provisions applied to the respective strain as outlined in this standard. Require that any OPV that cannot be stored under appropriate containment conditions for the specific strain is recalled and destroyed in accordance with international requirements .

The Global Action Plan addresses the risk of accidental infection and release of poliovirus by establishing a post -eradication/post -OPV cessation goal of retaining poliovirus in a limited number of PEFs worldwide. Implementation of the Global Action Plan further reduces the risk of accidents in these facilities by establishing international standards for facility, immunization coverage, and environmental safeguards . These safeguards are bolstered via assurance through national and international oversight that such standards are met. The safeguards required for poliovirus facilities are determined by the nature of the facility and the stage of global and local eradication as summarized in the Strategy section and Table 1 above. This Biorisk Management Standard for Poliovirus -essential Facilities Holding Wild and/or Sabin/OPV Poliovirus Materials describes the international requirements for the facility safeguards established for two groups of PEFs : (1) laboratories handling and/or storing WPV /VDPV materials or Salk -inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) production facilities, and (2) laboratories handling and/or storing Sabin/OPV poliovirus materials or Sabin- IPV production facilities. This standard builds on the principles outlined in ISO35001: Biorisk m anagement for laboratories and other related organisations [35] , the principles of the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual , Fourth Edition [26] and the extensive poliovirus scientific literature spanning nearly seven decades. Using the above documents , this standard emphasizes a risk -based approach to containing poliovirus that can be applied global ly despite the variability among PEFs. This standard relies upon local risk assessments , as the responsibility of the PEF and the NAC, to determine appropriate risk control and management techniques to meet the overarching goal of containment. This standard serves as the framework for national certification and WHO verification that certified PEFs comply with GAPIV (Containment Certification Scheme to support the WHO Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment - GAP -CCS) [36], consisting of 14 elements and sub- elements based on the principles of a biorisk management system. This standard assumes that the PEF best understands the risks associated with its work and can manage those risks in ways acceptable to the national and international bodies responsible for facility oversight. This standard further assumes that PEF personnel and management at all levels fully appreciate the enormity of the consequences of accidental or deliberate poliovirus release in the post eradication/post OPV era and are prepared to demonstrate that the appropriate systems and controls are fully implemented to manage those risks. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Organization of Management System Elements Organization of Management System Elements The content of this B iorisk Management Standard outlines the requirements for facilities that handle or store wild and/or Sabin/OPV poliovirus and potentially infectious materials as outlined in the Global Action Plan . It is organized into 14 elements and their sub- elements as enumerated in the element introductions. Throughout, guidance on meeting the requirements of this standard is incorporated into the sections for which the guidance is most relevant. All requirements are listed in the body of the text, with guidance relating to the requirement provided in the following box. All guidance is made av ailable to inform facilities about how requirements can be met, and the guidance should not itself be considered a requirement. That is, facilities will not be assessed against the implementation of items listed in the guidance boxes. The facility safeguard requirements outlined in this standard apply to facilities that handle or store WPV/VDPV and/or Sabin/OPV materials, unless otherwise noted. The requirements for immunization coverage and environmental safeguards in the area surrounding the PEF are outlined in the 'Strategy' section of GAPIV above. Additional resources for the National Authorities for Containment (NACs) and discussion regarding this standard can be found in the NAC group on the TechNet -21 Platform. Access will be granted to verified NAC members by contacting containment@who.int . Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System Element 1 - Biorisk Management System The biorisk management system element describes a system (and associated policy) in place to manage facility biorisk. Commitment from all levels of management in an organization is vital to the success of the system. Top management must define clear object ives, from which roles and responsibilities are allocated, implemented and monitored. Without effective leadership and a structured system, all other initiatives for managing risk will be ineffective. More detailed guidance on the implementation of a biori sk management system can be found in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition Associated Monograph: Biosafety Programme Management [37] .

Continual Improvement 1.1 Biorisk Management System 1.1.1 The organization must establish, document, implement and maintain a biorisk management system according to the requirements of this poliovirus biorisk management standard. 1.2 Biorisk Management Policy 1.2.1. The policy clearly states the overall biorisk management objective and a commitment to improving biorisk management performance. Biorisk management should be a clearly stated, prominent part of the organization's health, safety, security and environment (HSE) policies. Depending on the relevance of biorisk management to the organization, the biorisk management policy should complement the general HSE policies. As appropriate, the biorisk manageme nt policy may be integrated into the organization's HSE policies. 1.2.2 Management demonstrates commitment to the policy concerning the management of facility biorisk (biosafety and biosecurity) including development of the organizational biorisk policies, authorization of resources to meet the requirements of the policies and signing of institutional biorisk policies. The policy should require that all projects/work areas be assessed for risks and a full assessment be prepared before approval is given to commence work. 1.2.3 The policy is appropriate to the nature and scale of the risk associated with the facility and associated activities. 1.2.4 The policy commits to: 1. protecting staff, contractors, visitors, the community and the environment from poliovirus materials t hat are stored or handled within the facility; Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System 2. reducing the risk of the unintentional release of, or exposure to, poliovirus materials to an acceptable level; 3. reducing the risk of the unauthorized intentional release of hazardous biological materials to an acceptable level; 4. complying with all legal requirements applicable to the poliovirus materials that will be handled or possessed and with the requirements of this standard; 5. ensuring that effective biorisk management takes precedence over al l non- \"health and safety\" operational requirements; 6. effectively communicating individual obligations regarding biorisk to all personnel and relevant third parties; 7. continuously improving biorisk management performance; 8. conduct risk assessments and implement the required risk and evidence- based control measures. 1.3 Biorisk Managem ent Review 1.3.1 Management reviews the biorisk management system at planned intervals to ensure its continued suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. The management review may be conducted by top or senior management and should be conducted regularly, at a frequency determined by the needs of the organization but at least annually. The biorisk management system should be reviewed against the requirements outlined in this standard, with deviations documented and corrective actions recorded. 1.3.2 The review includes assessing opportunities for improvement and determining the need for changes to the system, procedures, policies and objectives. Review input should include information on: a. the results of audits; b. compliance with SOPs and work instructions; c. compliance with training programs and their effectiveness; d. meetings of the biorisk management committee; e. the status of risk assessment activities and control strategies; f. the status of corrective and preventive ac tions; g. follow -up actions from previous management reviews; h. changes that could affect the system; i. recommendations for improvement; j. the results of accident/incident investigations. 1.3.3 Records are maintained from the management review. Review output should include decisions and actions related to: a. improvement of the effectiveness of the biorisk management system; b. improvement related to the requirements and risk assessments; c. justification for changes deemed necessary; d. resource needs e. performance indicators to confirm changes to the program are performing to the level required 1.4 Objectives, Targets and Programme 1.4.1 Objectives and targets for effective biorisk management throughout the organization are established, implemented and maintained 1.4.2 Management must establish the biorisk controls and enact documented procedures for monitoring the effectiveness of those contr ols to reduce or eliminate the risks identified in the risk assessment process. Regular audits or other routine checks develop a proactive system for monitoring the effectiveness of biorisk controls by utilizing corrective- action reporting processes wher e problems have been Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System identified, by ensuring adequate resources are provided to maintain the effectiveness of the controls, and by investigating incidents and accidents and subsequently improving controls and their implementation. Refer to Element 2 Risk A ssessment. 1.5 Roles, Responsibilities and Authorities 1.5.1 Top management takes ultimate responsibility for the organization's biorisk management system. Top management is the person or group of people who directs and controls an organization at the highest level. Top management includes officers (Director -General, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, etc.) and directors of the organization. Overall responsibility for managing biorisk rests with top management, but tasks may be delegated to senior management provided they are passed to individuals with adequate resources, skills and training to perform the activities safely and securely. In smaller organizations, one individual may hold more than one role described in this standard. Roles and responsibilities should be defined through job descriptions and other associated mechanisms , such as individual reporting and performance measures. It is important to have clear communication within the organization regarding actions that need to be taken and establish who has the required authority. 1.5.2 Top management ensures that roles, responsibilities and authority related to biorisk management are defined, documented and communicated to those who manage, perform and verify work associated with the control of polioviruses . In assigning roles and responsibilities, potential conflicts of interest should be considered. This standard has identified roles that should be assigned in the organization and uses titles only to illustrate examples of these roles; the titles in this standard may not be equivalent to those used in specific organizations. 1.5.3 Top management demonstrates its commitment by ensuring the availability of resources to establish, implement, maintain and improve the biorisk management system. Transparent mechani sms should be in place to show that sufficient resources have been allocated, including human resources and specialized skills, organizational infrastructure, technology and financial resources. 1.5.4 A senior manager is designated operational responsibility to oversee the biorisk management of the facility. An alternate is assigned should the senior manager be unable to fulfil their oversight role. Senior managers are responsible for the creation of policies and guidelines and have significant operational, budgetary and personnel authority at the departmental or higher level. 1.5.5 The designated senior manager is responsible for: 1. providing appropriate resources to ensure the adequate provision of personnel, facilities and other resources deemed necessary for the safe and secure operation of the facility; 2. reporting to top management on the performance of the biorisk management system and any need for improvement; 3. ensuring adoption and promotion of the biorisk management system throughout the organization; 4. instituting review, audit and reporting measures to provide assurance that the requirements of this standard are being implemented and maintained effectively. The designated senior manager should be an individual with decision- making authority at a level whereby they can allocate resources required to conduct risk assessments and other management and administrative activities. The senior manager should be positioned to make decisions regarding the biorisk management needs of the facility independent of the need to implement the programme of work. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System 1.5.6 A biorisk management committee is constitute d to act as an independent review group for biorisk issues associated with the poliovirus facility. The biorisk management committee may be a body dedicated to poliovirus risk management or may act as the institutional biosafety committee with a wider remit. 1.5.7 The biorisk management committee reports to the designated senior manager and: 1. has documented function and scope; 2. includes representatives from a cross section of expertise, appropriate to the nature, scale, safety and security concerns of t he activities undertaken; 3. ensures issues addressed are formally recorded and actions are allocated, tracked and closed out effectively; 4. is chaired by a senior individual with experience in biorisk management ; 5. meets at a defined and appropriate frequency, a nd when otherwise required. Members of the biorisk management committee may include the scientific manager, additional scientific specialists, biorisk management advi sor(s), occupational health professional (s) and security manager (s) covering general, biological and information security . Others, such as the facility manager , animal care supervisor, and/or worker and community representatives, may be included depending on the nature of the agenda or work. Whenever possible the committee should include members independent of the activities that are being reviewed. The biorisk management committee sho uld meet at a minimum of quarterly and should maintain adequate records such as an agenda, minutes and recommendations. The functions of the committee can include: a. contributing to the development of institutional biorisk policies and codes of practice; b. approving proposals for new work or significant modifications to the potential risk associated with existing activities; c. reviewing and approving protocols and risk assessments for work involving polioviruses; d. reviewing information related to significant accid ents or incidents, data trends, associated local or organizational actions and communication needs. The list of roles for the biorisk management committee is not exhaustive but includes several main areas that should be addressed. 1.5.8 One or more competent i ndividuals are designated to provide advice and guidance on biorisk management issues. The competent individual providing advice and guidance on biorisk management is often recognized as a biorisk management advis or, biological safety officer or biological safety advis or. This function should normally be regarded as an advisory position and not one directly responsible for managing biorisk, as that rests with those conducting and managing the work within the organization (e.g., the scientific dire ctor, principal investigator, department head, laboratory manager, group leader). The role and knowledge of the biorisk management advis or are important to develop, implement, maintain and continually improve a biosafety and biosecurity programme. In the c ontext of vaccine production facilities, the biorisk management advis or should be knowledgeable in poliovirus vaccine production, current GMP and containment. The advis or should have adequate skills and training to perform the role and be allocated suffici ent time and other resources to do the job effectively. 1.5.9 The role of the biorisk management advis or is independent of the functions of those responsible for implementing the programme of work. In the execution of their biorisk management duties, advis ors have direct access to the designated senior manager and top management when necessary. 1.5.10 The biori sk management advis or: 1. reports directly to the designated senior manager; 2. advises the biorisk management committee; Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System 3. has delegated authority to stop work in the event that it is considered necessary to do so. The functions of the biorisk management advis or may include: a. verifying, in conjunction with other relevant personnel, that all relevant biorisk considerations have been addressed; b. participating in facility biosafety and biosecurity risk assessments; c. advising or participating in the reporting, investigation and follow -up of accidents/incidents and, where appropriate, referring these to management and/or the biorisk management committee; d. ensuring relevant and up- to-date information and advice on biorisk management are made available to scientific and other personnel as necessary; e. advising on biorisk management issues within the organization (e.g., management, biorisk management committee, occupational health department, security); f. contributing to the development and/or delivery of biori sk training activities; g. ensuring all relevant activities are performed in compliance with biorisk regulations, and the required biorisk authorizations for work are in place; 1.5.11 One or more individuals responsible for the scientific programme within the facil ity are designated with responsibilities relevant to biorisk management. The scientific manager should be responsible for managing the scientific programme within the facility on a day -to-day basis and for implementing and monitoring biorisk controls in association with other facility personnel (e.g., adhering to policies and procedures, monitoring staff performance and participation in inspections and audits). The individual may have an in- depth knowledge of the work programme and the facility, be in a supervisory/management position and may be referred to as Head of Department, Principal Investigator, Laboratory Supervisor/Manager or Group Leader. Competence is required in technical/scientific aspects of the poliovirus under their control and in the manag ement of the facility, its personnel and systems. More than one individual may hold similar roles, but in such instances, the responsibilities should be clearly defined to avoid any omissions and ensure consistency. 1.5.12 The scientific manager is responsible f or: 1. ensuring all work is conducted according to established policies described in this standard; 2. supervising workers, including ensuring only trained, competent and authorized personnel can enter and work in the facility; 3. planning and conducting work activities, and ensuring adequate staffing levels, time, space and equipment are available; 4. ensuring required authorizations for work are in place; 5. ensuring facility biosafety and biosecurity risk assessments have been performed, reviewed and approved, and the required control measures are in place; 6. ensuring all at -risk personnel have been informed of risk assessments and/or provisions for any recommended precautionary medical practices (e.g., vaccinations or serum collections). 1.5.13 One or more individuals res ponsible for occupational health within the facility are designated with responsibilities relevant to biorisk management. The occupational health professional should be a medical doctor or occupational health nurse with an understanding of the poliovirus materials handled within the facility. The role should include assessing and managing risk from a worker health perspective, advising on first aid/emergency treatment measures and liaising with first responders and external healthcare providers. They may a lso coordinate medical examinations, surveillance and vaccination programmes. The roles and responsibilities of the occupational health professional should be determined in accordance with the requirements established in this standard. See Element 3 Worker Health Programme and Element 13 Emergency Response and Contingency Planning. 1.5.14 The organization must establish an occupational health programme commensurate with the facility's activities and risks. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System 1.5.15 One or more facility managers are designated with responsibilities relevant to the facilities and equipment requirements established in this poliovirus biorisk management standard. The facility manager should be an engineer or a person with an in- depth knowledge of containment equipment, facilities and buildi ngs. They should liaise with the biorisk management advis or to assess and manage risk from a facility perspective as well as coordinate maintenance, building work and contractors. The roles and responsibilities of the facility management personnel should be determined in accordance with the requirements established in this standard. More than one individual may hold similar roles, but in such instances, the responsibilities should be clearly defined to avoid any omissions and ensure consistency. 1.5.16 A security manager is designated with responsibilities conforming to the security requirements established in this polio virus biorisk management standard. The security manager should have an in- depth knowledge of laboratory and facility security, liaise with other personnel (e.g., the biorisk management advis or) and implement effective and proportionate facility biosecurity measures based on the biological risk. The role should include participating in risk assessments and managing risk from a security persp ective. The roles and responsibilities of the security personnel should be determined in accordance with the requirements established in this standard. 1.5.17 One or more individuals responsible for emergency response within the facility are designated with responsibilities relevant to biorisk management. The emergency response manager should have an in -depth knowledge of the structures and mechanisms in place to respond to the need for working outside normal operating conditions and how to react to emergency situations. They should liaise with other internal personnel (e.g., the biorisk management advisor) and external emergency agencies (e.g., police, fire and ambulance services) for emergency and contingency planning. The ir roles and responsibilities should be determined in accordance with the requirements established in this standard. See Element 13 - Emergency Response and Contingency Planning. 1.5.18 In laboratories where animals are kept, an animal -care manager is designated with animal - related responsibilities conforming to the requirements established in this polio virus biorisk management standard. The animal -care manager should have an in- depth knowledge of animal husbandry, handling, behaviour and well-being as well as the risks associated with animal research and human pathogens associated with animal research. The animal -care manager should liais e with other personnel (e.g., biorisk management advis or, occupational health professional) to implement effective and proportionate facility biosafety and biosecurity measures. A qualified veterinarian should be available for additional advice. The role s hould include assessing and managing risk from an animal -care perspective. 1.6 Contractors and Suppliers 1.6.1 Purchases (including services) must conform to specified requirements. Controls on purchases (including services) are applied depending on the potential impact to the biorisk involved. 1.6.2 Suppliers are evaluated and selected based on their ability to provide products/services that meet the requirements of this poliovirus biorisk management standard. While not all suppliers will provide products/services that may have an impact on biorisk, many may. Supplier s that should be considered include, but are not limited to, those that provide: a. cleaning services; b. facility equipment; Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System c. waste management or disposal services; d. information technology support services; e. equipment and facility maintenance or certification serv ices; f. security services. 1.6.2 Criteria for selection, evaluation and re- evaluation of suppliers are established. 1.6.4 Records are maintained of evaluation results and any necessary actions arising from the evaluation. 1.7 Records, Documents and Data Control 1.7.1 Records, documents and data are established, controlled and maintained to provide evidence of conformity to the r equirements of this poliovirus biorisk management standard. 1.7.2 Records, documents and data are handled in such a way that they remain legible, readily identifiable and retr ievable. Documented records are maintained in paper or electronic form for a minimum of six years from their original containment certification audit and are available for review during subsequent containment certification audits. If not already in place, the collection and retention of records, documents and data must start immediately. Controlled documents may include but are not limited to: a. standard operating procedures (SOPs) and safety manuals; b. job hazard analyses and charts of authority; c. design records and commissioning/test plans, maintenance plans and records, annual facility verifications, and all associated data; d. audit and inspection checklists; e. facility biosecurity manuals, authorizations and other security documents; f. biosafety and security risk assessments; g. medical and personnel records; h. training records; i. incident reports and corrective actions; j. evaluations of suppliers; k. containment equipment certifications. This list of controlled documents is not exhaustive but includes several main areas that should be formally recorded and subjected to document control. Electronic data, spreadsheets, databases, and other media in which information related to the above list are stored should be considered documents for the purpose of this requirement . A procedure should be established to define the controls needed for the identification, storage, protection, retrieval, retention period and disposal of records. A procedure sh ould be established to define the controls needed for the approval of documents prior to their issue or public release, to ensure sensitive information, such as personnel medical records or the specific freezer locations of pathogen repositories, is not inadvertently released. Procedures should also be established to define the controls needed for the review, update and reapproval of documents, and for the control of change and revision process. 1.8 Analysis of Data 1.8.1 The suitability of the biorisk man agement system is assessed by identifying, collecting, and analysing appropriate data. This analysis is used to evaluate where continual improvement of the system can be made. The analysis should include data generated by monitoring, measurement, audits, analysis and from other sources. Such analyses should be conducted at least annually, and more often if justified by the risks and scope of operations. The results of the analysis should be applied in the management review. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System 1.9 Programme of Work 1.9.1 The programme of work for the facility is defined, documented and reviewed. The programme should include the nature of the activities authorized to be conducted in the facility and their definitions (e.g., diagnostics, research, small scale/large scale). All activities associated with the work programme should be specified and supported by formal SOPs approved in line with the requirements for controlled documents, as defined by this standard. Any changes to the programme of work should be subject to a formal change management process. 1.9.2 Work that requires prior approval is defined by established criteria. Any change to the poliovirus programme of work or processes that affect biorisk are required to be reported to the NAC to maintain certification, as outlined in the Containment Certification Scheme to support the WHO Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP -CCS) [36]. 1.10 Change Management 1.10.1 All changes associated with the design, operation and maintenance of the facility are subject to a defined and documented change management process. These changes should be reviewed, verified and validated as appropriate and approved by the biorisk management committee before implementation. This should include an evaluation of the effect of the changes on the risk assessment . Any significant change in risk should be elevated to the designated senior manager and top management as appropriate. Examples of changes that should be subject to the change management process include: a. modifications to buildings and equipment or their operation that may affect biorisk; b. introduction of altered staffing arrangements (such as the temporary presence of on- site contract ors or students, temporary reassignments of personnel); c. changes to the programme of work, including changes to strains used, volume or workflow, should be evaluated based on impact to biorisk; d. alterations to SOPs, including significant changes in materials or reagents; e. modifications to entry/exit protocols; f. modifications to personnel policies and visitor protocols; g. modifications to disinfection, decontamination and other waste management methodologies; h. changes associated with the provision and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). 1.11 Consultation and Communication 1.11.1 Relevant biorisk information related to an organization's activities is communicated to and received from personnel and other relevant parties. The organization should implement mechan isms to ensure relevant information that may affect personnel operations and/or safety is defined, documented and delivered effectively at appropriate intervals. Communication mechanisms could entail regular team meetings and briefings in the workplace, as well as formal training sessions. In addition to facility personnel, it may also be appropriate to engage others, including: a. local, national and international governmental organizations; b. relevant regulatory agencies; c. equipment and/or facility certifiers; d. emergency services and healthcare providers; e. contractors and suppliers (e.g., cleaners, maintenance providers, security personnel); f. local community representatives (e.g., through a community liaison committee). Systems should be put in place t o identify existing or emerging technologies and other information relevant to the containment of poliovirus materials. This information should be shared with relevant Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System staff through appropriate media, including the posting of appropriate signage, circulati on of documents, holding of team briefings and the maintenance of reference libraries. 1.11.2 Involvement of personnel in communication and consultation arrangements is documented. 1.11.3 Personnel have access to adequate and up- to-date information about the biorisks and the mitigation measures in place to control those risks. 1.12 Legal Requirements 1.12.1 The organization ensures that all relevant legal requirements are identified and fulfilled within the biorisk management system. Legal requirements include national/federal, regional/state, provincial, city and local regulations with which the organization must comply. If this standar d differs from regulations or legislation, facilities must satisfy the more rigorous requirement. The organization should adopt measures to identify the legal requirements for the poliovirus materials being held and used but also other regulations such as worker protection and rights, animal welfare and protection, environmental impact, and general hea lth and safety (e.g., fire, electrical). The organization should m onitor for new and upcoming requirements, as well as those that already exist. This information should be kept up- to-date, and the requirements should be incorporated into the facility's bio risk management system. 1.13 Preventive Action 1.13.1 Action is taken to identify and eliminate the causes of potential nonconformities to prevent their occurrence. A procedure should be established to: a. determine the potential nonconformities and their causes; b. evaluate the need for action to prevent the occurrence of nonconformities; c. determine and implement the action needed; d. record the results of action taken; e. review the preventive actions taken and their effectiveness through Key Performance indicators or other appropriate metrics. 1.13.2 Preventive actions must be commensurate to the effects of the potential nonconformities. 1.14 Inspection and Audit 1.14.1 An inspection and audit programme that is appropriate to the risk associated with the facility is conducted in accordance with the guidance provided in the GAP -CCS [36, 38] . Inspections may be frequent checks of specific areas, conducted to ensure sufficient standards are being maintained (e.g., disinfectant levels/concentrations, air exchange rates/maintenance of directional air flow) or may be more extensive but less frequent inspections of laboratories, facilities or other operations. The frequency of inspections should be set as part of performance monitor ing. Random, unannounced inspections and inventory audits can help ensure compliance at all times and not just in time for scheduled inspections. Audits should be performed by competent individuals unaffiliated with the audited activity. Records of inspect ion/audit findings should be maintained, including action taken to close out any nonconformities or pursue improvement opportunities. 1.13.1 Internal inspections and audits are conducted at planned intervals to determine if the biorisk management system conforms to the documented plans and the requirements of this B iorisk Management Standard and if it is effectively implemented and maintained. An external audit programme is conducted regularly by the relevant national authorities to determine if the biorisk ma nagement system conforms to the requirements of this standard and is functioning properly and to ensure necessary corrective actions are taken and verified without undue delay. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System Facilities that meet these requirements under their National Authority for Containment (NAC) in accordance with the GAP -CCS will be eligible for certification and endorsement by the Global Commission for the Certification of the Eradication of Poliomyelitis (GCC ). The NAC issues, suspends or revokes certificates of containment, in consultation with the GCC. Top management ensures that information relevant to the audit and certification process is made available in English for the GAP -CCS process . 1.14.2 Management responsible for the area being inspected/audited ensures that any corrective actions are taken without undue delay to eliminate detected nonconformities and their causes. 1.14.3 Follow -up activities include verification of the actions taken and reporting of the ver ification results to top management. 1.15 Control of Nonconformities 1.15.1 Situations that do not conform to the requirements of the site- specific biorisk management policy are identified and controlled to prevent undesirable consequences. The controls, authorities and related responsibilities needed to address nonconforming situations should be defined in a standard operating procedure. 1.15.2 Records of the nature of the nonconformity and any subsequent corrective action taken are maintained. 1.16 Corrective Action 1.16.1 To prevent the recurrence of any nonconformities, action is taken to develop a procedure that enables elimination of their causes using the requirements of this poliovirus biorisk management standard. A procedure should be established to define requirements to: a. review the nonconformities; b. determine the root cause of nonconformities; c. evaluate the need for action to ensure nonconformities do not recur; d. determine the corrective action needed; e. verify the action per a change management process, as described above; f. implement the approved corrective action; g. record and review the results of action taken. 1.16.2 Corrective actions are in proportion to the effects of the nonconformities encountered. For containment certification a udits, they are prioritized by the classification of the nonconformity as major (category 1) or minor (category 2), as described in the GAP -CCS [36]. The time frame for completion is detailed in the GAP -CCS [36], but nonconformities should be resolved in a manner that prevents future adverse outcomes by preventing the persistence or recurrence of the nonconformity. 1.17 Continual Improvement 1.17.1 The organization continually improves the effectiveness of the biorisk management system through: 1 the policy; 2 its objectives; 3 the internal audit programme; 4 audit results; 5 the analysis of available data; 6 risk assessment s; Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 1 - Biorisk Management System 7 corrective and preventive actions; 8 management review. The organization should strive to continue developing and refining the systems in place to ensure that further opportunities to improve the biorisk management system are identified and implemented, which may be achieved by setting objectives and giving targets to those working within the facility and by monitoring progress to ensure the objectives are achieved. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 2 - Risk A ssessment and Control Element 2 - Risk Assessment and Control Risk assessment and control is a critical element in developing and implementing a robust Biorisk Management System. Risk assessment is a systematic process involving a team of personnel who have the knowledge and c ompetence to identify, assess, control, and evaluate risks. While risk in a poliovirus facility is driven by poliovirus, other infectious agents and facility risks should be identified and addressed in a holistic manner. The General Risks sub-element exami nes the processes in place to ensure hazards associated with the personnel's work in the facility are identified and managed while also addressing their implications to impact biorisk. Organizations should take both a preventive and proactive approach to establish measures to identify, detect, mitigate and respond to emergencies. Risk assessment is only a part of the entire Biorisk Management System and should be reviewed as a part of the system. More detailed guidance on general biological risk assessment can be found in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition Associated Monograph: Risk Assessment [2]. Sub-elements 2.1. General Risks 2.2. Process, Methodologies and Procedures 2.3. Assessment Timing and Scope 2.4. Roles and Responsibilities for Risk Assessment 2.5. Hazard Identification 2.6. Risk Evaluation and Cont rol 2.7. Implementing Risk Control Measures 2.8. Monitoring Effectiveness 2.1 General Risks 2.1.1 A formal process is in place to identify and manage risk that may compromise general safety. The organization should adopt a preventive and a proactive approach to managing such sources of risk, both to protect workers from the direct hazards associated with their work and to address the implications for biorisk in the event of an accident/incident resulting from such sources. Measures should be identified and implemented to prevent, detect, control and respond to emergencies, taking into consideration the potential implications for poliovirus control in such measures. Issues addressed should include but are not limited to: a. general facility risks; b. fire risks; c. electrical risks; d. radiation risks; e. chemical risks; f. the use of gases (including risk of asphyxiation); g. work with hot and cold sources; h. risks with pressurized equipment; i. laboratory animal care an d manipulation; j. health emergencies; k. general housekeeping, including storage requirements and tidiness, and risks with general waste. 2.2 Process, Methodologies and Procedures 2.2.1 The organization ensures that a risk assessment system is established, implemented and maintained. 2.2.2 The performance of the risk management system is reported to the designated senior manager for review. This review is used as a basis for improvement. 2.2.3 Relevant personnel within the organization identify those operations and activities associated with risks, including possible biological risk and where control measures are to be applied. 2.2.4 Activities associated with possible biological risk, including maintenance, are carried out under conditions specified by the risk management system. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 2 - Risk Assessment and Control 2.3. Assessment Timing and Scope 2.3.1 The approach to risk assessment is defined according to its scope, nature and timing to ensure it is proa ctive rather than reactive. The following should trigger either a new risk assessment or the review of an existing one: a. commencement of new work or changes to the programme of work, including the introduction of new biological agents or alterations to workflow or volume; b. new construction/modifications to laboratories, plants and equipment or their operation; c. introduction of altered and unplanned staffing arrangements, including those concerning contractors, visitors and other noncore pers onnel; d. significant alterations to SOPs or working practices (e.g., disinfection/waste management methodologies, changes in strains, reagents or disposables, PPE provision, usage entry, exit protocols); e. unexpected events that may be relevant to the management of biorisks; f. actual or potential nonconformity with internal/external rules and regulations (e.g., the introduction of new legislation or major accident exposure); g. consideration of emergency response and contingency planning requirements; h. the existing m anagement system review process (e.g., annually or at another appropriate and predetermined frequency). Many defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification, risk assessment and control; the approach taken will vary depending on the nature of the situation and the level of detail required. One framework that organizations may consider adopting can be found in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition Associated Monograph: Risk Assessment [2]. 2.4. Roles and Responsibilities for Risk Assessment 2.4.1 Resource requirements are identified, and adequate resources are allocated, including assigning competent personnel to perform risk assessments and evaluation activities, such as internal review of risk control measures in place. Risk assessment teams may consist of supervisors, staff who perform the work, safety personnel , maintenance staff and any others who understand the procedure, hazards, and activities being assessed. The roles and responsibilities of personnel who perform and verify work affecting risk management should be defined and documented, particularly for people who need the organizational freedom and authority to: a. initiate action to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of risk; b. control the further treatment of risks until the level of risk becomes acceptable; c. identify and record any problems related to managing risks; d. initiate, recommend or provide solutions through designated channels; e. communicate and consult internally and externally as appropriate. 2.5. Hazard Identification 2.5.1 The hazards associated with proposed work are identified and documented. The first stage in the risk management process is to identify all hazards relevant to biorisk. It is useful to involve the whole work team in this process and to use inputs from org anizational experts on safety and risk management. Existing standard operating procedures, work instructions, experimental protocols, and manufacturers protocols should be reviewed to identify hazards and assess for risk. Hazards can be associated with: a. Material (e.g., infectious agents or clinical samples, volume, concentration and stability of the poliovirus at the site), Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 2 - Risk Assessment and Control b. Equipment/facility (e.g., centrifuge, incubators, room layout, ventilation of biosafety cabinets , potential results of minor and major systems failures) c. Process (e.g., pipetting, plating, PCR, ELISA), d. Human factors (e.g., level of competency or training), and e. Any other factor that may affect facility operations. Some hazards may belong to more than one category. Defined methodologies and approaches are available to conduct hazard identification exercises. Unless hazards are identified effectively, it is not possible to characterize the risk associated with the facility and its activities. More detail on one approach to hazard identification can be found in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition Associated Monograph: Risk Assessment [2]. 2.6. Risk Evaluation and Control 2.6.1. Suitable methodologies for assessing and recording risks are identified, implemented and maintained. Risk assessment methodology and outcomes are documented. The risk assessment should identify and categorize risks associated with the identified hazards. Separate risk assessments can be performed for individual hazards if required. Questions to consider can include but are not limited to: a. How could an exposure, release, l oss and/or theft occur? How likely is it that they occur? b. What are the consequences of exposure/release? c. What is the overall risk (combined likelihood and consequence of exposure/release) of the activit ies? d. Is this risk acceptable? Is this risk unacceptable? e. Can the unacceptable risks be controlled or reduced to an acceptable level? For each characterized risk, controls should be identified. Controls can include but are not limited to: a. engineering methods such as directional air flow, biosafety cabinets, physical separation of some procedures etc.; b. administrative methods such as SOPs, work instructions and scheduling, training and competency, supervision, etc.; c. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as double -gloves or respiratory protection; d. remove and/or cease all activities with the identified hazard. Risk assessments can be qualitative, semi -quantitative or quantitative. Wherever possible and considered necessary, a quantitative method for risk assessment should be used. When a quantitative method is not possible (which is often the case in biological risk assessment), a qualitative or semi -quantitative method can be used. In conducting the assessment, due consideration should be given to the inherent risk from polioviruses (e.g., from agent specific information sheets). After defining and implementing control measures, the risks assessments should be reviewed to decide wh ether the remaining risk is acceptable or additional controls need to be identified and implemented. Multiple risk control measures are often implemented in combination to minimize residual risk. 2.7. Implementing Risk Control Measures 2.7.1. Suitable methodologies for assigning actions that result from risk assessments are identified, implemented and maintained, including timelines, responsible persons and associated reporting and approval mechanisms. The risk management approach should have a documented control plan that includes: a. who is responsible and accountable for implementing the plan; b. what resources are to be used (e.g., personnel, budget); c. ensures availability of the required resources; Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 2 - Risk Assessment and Control d. a timetable for implementation; e. details of the mechanism and frequency of reviewing compliance with the plan; f. review and approval of the plan by the biorisk management committee and biorisk management advis or. Once risk control measures have been selected and the risk control plan has been approved, actions to tak e before reviewed work begins include but are not limited to: a. ensure that risk control strategies have been communicated to relevant personnel; b. update Standard Operating Procedures or work instructions to include the identified risk control strategies; c. ensure that relevant operational and maintenance procedures have been put into place; d. ensure that personnel have been properly trained to implement the identified risk control measures. 2.8 Monitoring Effectiveness 2.8.1 Risk controls are monitored for effectiveness and revised when needed. Monitoring the effectiveness of risk assessment is part of performance monitoring of the biorisk manage ment system, including audits and inspections as described in Element 1. 13 Inspection and Audit. Internal inspections and audits should include review of facility process and procedures to ensure that the risk control methods documented in the risk control plan are being followed and continue to be effective. Risk assessment documents should be reviewed periodically as a part of the internal audit process, when there is any change in circumstances, or in response to an incident or near -miss. Risk assessme nt documents may be adjusted and modified based on changing work needs. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 3 - Worker Health Programme Element 3 - Worker Health Programme The Worker Health Programme element evaluates the systems in place to protect workers from injuries and illnesses resulting from exposure to poliovirus and how workers are supported in the event of an accident or exposure. Subject areas covered include exposure control, health care, health monitoring, immunization and the availability of competent first aid and external assistance. Sub-elements 3.1 Worker Health Programme 3.2 Vaccination of Personnel 3.3 Medical Emergencies 3.1 Worker Health Programme 3.1.1 The organization ensures that the risk to worker health, and that of other personnel whose health could be directly harmed by exposure to p oliovirus materials, is managed effectively, including through preventive and protective measures. The programme should address the needs of all individuals associated with the facility, including providing assurance that contractors and visitors receive the required level of protection suitable for the activities they perform, as well as safeguarding workers' families. 3.1.2 The requirements of the health surveillance programme are determined by a defined health hazard identification and risk assessment process that involves all relevant personnel. The programme should consult relevant personnel that may includ e: a. the biorisk management advis or; b. the occupational health professional; c. facility personnel and personnel representatives; d. external experts, including emergency responders; e. biorisk management committee members; f. veterinary and animal -care facility representatives ; g. human resource representatives; h. the communicable disease specialist; i. scientific management. Organizations should identify personnel considered to have significant risk of exposure and assess their healthcare needs, including the need for vaccination, PPE provision and emergency measures that encompass isolation/testing in the event of exposure. The individual's health and immune status should be considered and periodic checks appropriate to work conditions should be established. Although the primary focus of the assessment is exposure to the poliovirus materials being handled, other conditions that could harm personnel associated with the facility should also be addressed. These may include medical conditions that could affect the work (e.g., epilepsy, heart attack, impaired vision, physical mobility/dexterity), the ability to safely use appropriate PPE, other workplace hazards (e.g., chemical exposure, radiation, fire hazards) or factors affecting general well -being (e.g., stress, depression, pregnancy, immune status, substance abuse). Information covered by the worker health programme should be treated confidentially. All ind ividuals should have access to consultation with a corporate or institutional occupational health facility or an independent healthcare provider. They should be informed of the nature of any treatments/vaccinations they may receive and their inherent risks and benefits. 3.2. Vaccination of Personnel 3.2.1 Personnel , contractors , and visitors must demonstrate established immunity to poliovirus through evidenc e of poliovirus antibodies before entering the containment perimeter . The need for subsequent vaccination and antibody titre testing is determined based on risk assessment and is consistent with national occupational health guidelines. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 3 - Worker Health Programme The Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) may provide support for assessing poliovirus antibody titres in workers to ensure demonstrable immunity to poliovirus. Organizations should implement measures to identify those who are not protected after vaccination (depending on the vaccine's response rate) and implement a pol icy to address these individuals. Individuals considered unfit for work in the facility on health grounds should be identified and prevented from accessing areas with likelihood of exposure. Areas requiring vaccinations to enter should be posted. Reasonable measures should be taken to ensure that the vaccin es have been given and current certificates are valid. These measures may include examining original certificates and cross -checking with medical practices responsible for administering the vaccine. The organization should ensure the required or recommended vaccines are made available to concerned personnel. Vaccination should be seen as a risk control strategy that addresses consequences of an exposure. This should not impact any effort within the facili ty in minimizing the likelihood of exposure by any mitigation measures and controls that can reasonably be implemented , such as the use of good microbiological practices or PPE, because vaccination does not necessarily prevent onward transmission. Personne l, temporary workers, contractors and visitors who enter the containment facilities (or other areas where work was conducted with poliovirus) may be exempted from the immunization requirement if the area being accessed, as determined by risk assessment, wa s decontaminated using a validated procedure. 3.2.2 A vaccination policy is defined and implemented. Vaccination policies for containment facilities should be defined by risk assessment, documented, approved by the NAC and verified by the CWG . 3.2.3 Access to laboratories or work is restricted for individuals until they comply with the vaccination policy. 3.3. Medical Emergencies 3.3.1 A system is established to effectively manage medical emergencies, including but not limited to identifying potentially infected workers and providing immediate medical care to exposed, ill or injured workers. This system is in alignment with the legal framework for reporting public health events involving polioviruses set forth in Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) [24]. Procedures should ensure that adequate emergency planning is provided to address worker health needs in the event of an accident or emergency. Additional guidance can be found in Public Health Management of Facility Related Exposure to Live Poliovirus [29] . This provision should extend to first responders and their families, t o members of the broader community and to environmental conditions that may have been affected by the incident. It should include identifying emergency scenarios (e.g., involving an infected worker/family member) and necessary support measures (e.g., liais on with emergency services/local authorities) and providing equipment and other resources required to manage the emergency (e.g., prophylaxis, post -exposure treatment, disinfectants, isolation requirements, vaccines). The necessary plans and other material s for managing medical emergencies should be prepared, tested and maintained. Procedures should ensure that adequate first aid is available in relation to credible accident scenarios, as identified during risk assessments. The procedures should address t he need for adequately trained personnel and their availability, as well as equipment and other materials that may be required to provide treatment. Procedures should ensure additional competent medical support is identified and made available (e.g., hospitals, isolation units). See Element 13 Emergency Response and Contingency Planning. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 4 - Competence and Training Element 4 - Competence and Training The Competence and Training element covers the processes in place to ensure that only personnel with appropriate qualifications are recruited, that they are subsequently trained in all aspects of the work programme, and that their competency is assessed and monitored in a structured way. This element also examines how capacity issues are addressed and how staff turnover is managed to ensure the organization is not left vulnerable when critical roles are vacated. Sub-elements 4.1 Recruitment 4.2 Training 4.3 Competence 4.4 Human Factors 4.5 Continuity and Succession Planning 4.6 Exclusion and Reinstatement 4.1. Recruit ment 4.1.1 Qualifications, experience, and reliability to observe appropriate codes of practice and aptitudes related to biorisk are considered as part of the recruitment process. Prior to employing a candidate, the organization should ensure that: a. personnel were subject to a formal selection process, including relevant background checks based on risk (e.g., employment references, security checks); b. appropriate controls are implemented should existing personnel be transferred to areas where there may be an increased risk profile; c. all personnel entering areas with potential for exposure to poliovirus materials accept compliance with the healthcare standards outlined in E lement 4 Worker Health Programme ; d. an assessment is made of the need for the above controls for non- core personnel (e.g., contractors, visitors, students), and measures are implemented to ensure they are applied where necessary. 4.2. Training 4.2.1 Requirements and procedures for biorisk -related training of personnel are identified, es tablished and maintained. For all persons working within the containment perimeter as defined in Element 8.3.3 Infrastructure and Operational Management as well as all those who may need to enter the perimeter, including medical support staff, quality control staff, emergency responders, maintenance and cleaning staff, training procedures should: a. define biorisk training needs, including training specific to the characteristics of poliovirus, biosafety and hygiene relevant to work conducted and the procedures for minimizing risk within the facility; b. provide the required biorisk training; c. include determinations of the effectiveness of the biorisk training; d. provide for refresher biorisk training; e. ensure individuals are restricted from performing tasks for which they are not trained; The content of a biorisk training programme will be specific to the organization, however a list of training topics outlined in this standard may include: a. general biorisk awareness, including the relevance of human factors ; b. SOP- specific training for relevant personnel; c. training on the contents of the biosafety manual; d. PPE training; e. animal husbandry, handling, and manipulation; f. waste management; g. security; h. insider threat awareness. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 4 - Competence and Training 4.3 Competence 4.3.1 Personnel who have responsibilities and/or perform tasks within the poliovirus facility that may impact biorisk management are competent to execute those responsibilities and tasks. No personnel are exempt from demonstrating competence, irrespective of rank, experience or background. 4.3.2 Competence levels are judged on appropriate education, training, experience together with a demonstrated ability to correctly perform their assigned responsibilities in a safe and secure manner . 4.3.3 Personnel who conduct activities within the facility are under close supervision until they have demonstrated competency. After initial demonstration of competency , personnel should be reviewed and provided with any refresher training as needed to maintain competenc e and safet y compliance. 4.3.4 The organization must define required levels of competency in accordance with this standard and with any existing legal regulations. The designated manager is responsible for ensuring only competent personnel access the facility ( see Element 1.4.12 Roles, Responsibilities and Authorities). 4.3.5 Records are maintained that show staff members have attained and demonstrated those levels of competency. 4.4 Human Factors 4.4.1 The organization establishes and maintains a programme to address risk associated with human behaviour, including the management of how personnel interact with each other , the facility and its equipment. Many facility incidents are caused by inappropriate behaviour or human error and a preventive and proactive approach to managing these risks should be pursued, including the specific inclusion of such issues in risk assessments. The use of competent experts in assessing this area should be considered. Measures should be put in place to promote: a. human reliability and behavioural safety, including adherence to procedures; b. team building and motivation; c. communication, consultation and feedback; d. conflict management and resolution; e. the management of stress and fatigue; f. empowerment of all levels of personnel , including authority to correct unsafe practices or stop work if potentially unsafe or unsecure conditions are identified; g. access to counselling; h. a culture of willingness to report ac cidents, incidents or unsafe conditions/behaviours, and protection of workers who do so, including the avoidance of a \"blame culture\"; i. ergonomics, including equipment and work practice design to take account of individual needs; j. respect for individual priv acy and dignity. 4.5 Continuity and Succession Planning 4.5.1 Adequate backup and contingency measures are in place to address the need for continuity and succession planning. The organization should identify roles and individuals that require a substitute, ensuring the integrity of the facility is not compromised through short - or long- term absence. Such measures should include succession planning for personnel (technical, management and scientific, including contractors) to guarantee that all critical knowledge regarding the safe and secure operation of the facili ty is available to others even in the event of an individual's departure or unavailability. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 4 - Competence and Training 4.6 Exclusion and Reinstatement 4.6.1 Measures are put in place for the removal and exclusion of personnel (both temporary and, if appropriate, permanent) from the facility, where deemed necessary through risk assessment. The measures should: a. remove access to the facility (e.g., taking away passes, changing locks and keys and access codes, and other security devices); b. withdraw access to information related to the facility, including documentation, computerized records and data; c. allow the immediate physical removal of personnel if deemed necessary. 4.6.2 Measures are put in place and documented for re- evaluation of temporarily excluded personnel when deemed appropriate t hrough risk assessment. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 5 - Good Microbiological Practice and Procedure Element 5 - Good Microbiological Practice and Procedure The Good Microbiological Practice and Procedure element examines how an organization identifies appropriate microbiological techniques and controls and how they are implemented and reviewed. A major part of this element is the development of a biosafety manual, which identifies hazards that may be encountered and specifies practices and procedures designed to minimize or eliminate risks. The biosafety or operations manual is a site -specific guidance document that is developed, implemented and updated as needed and is readily available to personnel who may encounter poliovirus materials during the course of their duties. The manual contains institutional biosafety policies, programme information and plans. Sub-element 5.1 Biosafety Manual 5.2 Good Microbiological Practice and Procedure 5.1. Biosafety Manual 5.1.1 The biosafety manual contains site -specific information for promoting a safe, secure workplace and reducing the probability of a release of poliovirus containing material and is based on risk assessments focused on hazards associated with poliovirus/poliovirus containing materials. As appropriate, the site- specific biosafety manual should address , but is not limited to, the following components: a. emergency contact information b. scope and purpose; c. roles and responsibilities; d. characteristics of poliovirus and signs and symptoms of infection; e. comprehensive risk assessment process; f. good microbiological practices and procedures; g. special microbiological practices and procedures; h. universal precautions and sharps disposal; i. biosafety training; j. disinfection, decontamination and sterilization proc esses and their validation; k. accidents, spills and potential exposure incidents; incident response, reporting, investigation and control /remediation processes; l. occupational health programme; m. biocontainment elements: administrative controls, specific recommended work practices, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), primary containment, facility engineering controls; n. facility inspection, audit and testing; o. biosecurity; p. transport, transf er and disposition of biological material; q. biological material record keeping; r. pest control programme; s. facility housekeeping programme; t. references. SOPs containing specific and applied information pertinent to these topics should be referenced in the biosafety manual and made available to personnel during training. Elements in the site- specific biosafety manual should meet or exceed the requirements outlined in this biorisk management standard. 5.1.2 All personnel in the facility where poliovirus materials are used or stored or who may encounter poliovirus materials during the course of their job duties must read and adhere to the biosafety Manual. Training of relevant personnel on the contents of the manual and associated biosafety SOPs is critic al to effective Biorisk Management. 5.2 Good Microbiological Practice and Procedure Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 5 - Good Microbiological Practice and Procedure 5.2.1 All personnel handling poliovirus materials must be competent in good microbiological practices and procedures. All manipulations of poliovirus infectious materials are performed within primary containment as described in Element 8.3.4 Infrastructure and O perational Management. 5.2.2 Appropriate resources (including time and equipment) are available to ensure good microbiological practices are adhered to effectively. As appropriate, procedures should address risks associated with but not limited to the followin g: a. the handling of infectious poliovirus materials; b. animal handling and manipulation; c. aerosol -generating procedures; d. handling of needles and sharps; e. use of vacuum pumps; f. culture, purification and storage techniques; g. sonication and other mechanical forms of cell/tissue disruption; h. use of biological safety cabinets (BSCs); i. use of disinfectants, including routine decontamination and spill control; j. doffing and donning; k. handwashing and hygiene . This list is not exhaustive and identifies only some activities that may be employed during typical laboratory work. These activities should be undertaken in association with appropriate procedures and working practices to ensure the control measures are effective under all foreseeable and credible operating scenarios. Good microbiological practices and procedures that should be adhered to address the risks above include but are not limited to: l. no eating, drinking, smoking or applying of cosmetics in the containment facility; m. no mouth pi petting; n. implementing measures to minimize aerosol generation when manually transferring or mixing materials containing live poliovirus; o. implementing policies on the safe handling of sharps; p. conducting all manipulations of materials containing poliovirus under conditions of primary containment; q. decontaminating work surfaces after handling materials containing live poliovirus and after any spill of viable material; r. decontaminating equipment before removing it from the facility or prior to repair or maintenance. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 6 - Clothing and Personal Pr otective Equipment (PPE) Element 6 - Clothing and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) The Clothing and PPE element examines how an organization ensures that personnel are provided with the personal protective measures to minimize potential exposures and that PPE is properly maintained. This element specifically addresses the characteristics of some key PPE, for example the use of respirators but also considers other items, including gloves, laboratory coats and footwear. Specific PPE to be used at a facility will be determined based on the site- specific risk assessment. 6.1 Clothing and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 6.1.1 PPE needs are identified through project -specific risk assessment. Management should ensure that: a. adequate information is used in selecting PPE (e.g., risk assessments, review and analysis of tasks, personnel feedback , ergonomic requirements ); b. the risks associated with PPE itself are identified and controlled (e.g., impaired dexterity or visibility); c. all personnel who use PPE, including scientific staff, visitors and contractors, are identified, trained in PPE use and supplied with correctly fitting equipment (including respirators) and clothing . PPE should be used in conjunction with, but never as a substitute for, reasonable and appropriate administrative and engineering controls. PPE should be used in accordance with established standards and manufacturer specifications. Employers should make PPE available to personnel at no cost. 6.1.2 Suitable PPE is specified, made available, used and maintained appropriately within the facility. Poliovirus -specific PPE needs should be determined by a risk assessment and may include the use of face shields, goggles, gloves, double gloves, surgical masks, HEPA -filtered respirators and clothing strictly dedicated for use within the containment perimeter ( as defined in Element 8.3.3 Infrastructure and Operational Management ), including solid front gowns or other clothing protecting the body from exposure. Though specific PPE needs will be driven by the work being conducted and site- specific risk assessment, PPE selection should be made to ensure that no exposed skin or street clothing should be come into contact with poliovirus material during normal operations. Respirators can be used when conducting procedures with a high risk of aerosol generation. Protective clothing is removed when leaving the containment area and should be decontaminated using a validated procedure prior to reuse or disposal. Routine checks and maintenance of PPE should be defined and carried out based on manufacturers recommendations. Replacement and spare PPE should be made available based on the site -specific risk assessment. Procedures should be in place for the cleaning and, if appropriate, the validated decontamination of used PPE, including safe stor age prior to decontamination. Additional information on PPE can be found in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition Associated Monograph: Personal Protective Equipment [39]. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 7 - Security Element 7 - Security The Security ele ment examines how an organization manages security with regard to biorisk , including facility biosecurity . The element examines prevention of unauthorized individuals entering the facility or accessing materials, prevention of unauthorized access to inform ation generated by the facility, and prevention of incidents caused by individuals with authorized access. Sub-elements 7.1 Physical Security 7.2 Information Security 7.3 Personnel Control 7.4 Personal Security 7.5 Contractors, Visitors and Suppliers 7.1. Physical Security 7.1.1 A risk assessment process for identifying physical security needs is in place in accordance with Element 2 Risk Assessment and Control . Controls are implemented and maintained for the physical security of cultures, specimens, samples, an imals and potentially contaminated materials or waste, determined as part of the risk assessment process. Measures should be put in place to minimize the potential for release or removal of poliovirus materials from the facility due to a breach in securit y. These measures should proactively identify vulnerabilities and implement effective control and monitoring mechanisms. In planning and conducting security risk assessments, the organization should consider the likelihood as well as the consequence of: a. break -in and intrusion; b. sabotage, including cyberthreats, vandalism, picketing, occupation and barricade; c. labour issues and disputes , including workplace violence; d. the failure of utilities; e. weather -related emergencies (e.g., earthquake, tsunami, flood, tornado, hurricane); f. acts o f terrorism , civil unrest or war ; g. theft or diversion of poliovirus materials or related equipment, documents or data. Care should be taken to coordinate biosecurity and biosafety measures to manage and minimize conflicting priorities. Security breaches s hould be reported, recorded and investigated. External authorities, such as law enforcement, should be involved if necessary. Procedures for the physical security of poliovirus materials, including cultures, specimens, samples and potentially contaminated materials, should be implemented and maintained to ensur e: a. the containment facility is located on a secure site with perimeter control to prevent unauthorized access; b. the containment facility is located away from uncontrolled traffic flows ( e.g., entrance is via a locked door with two- factor access control measures requiring an electronic pass and personal access code); c. a second person within the containment perimeter as defined in Element 8.3.3 Infrastructure and Operational management or in close proximity is aware of the work being conducted during poliovirus work, is available for contact, and can provide assistance if needed; d. the facility perimeter is subject to constant monitoring (e.g., through the use of alarms, securit y personnel and/or closed- circuit television); e. measures are implemented to identify and record all personnel in the facility at any point in time; f. anti-intrusion alarms and sensors are installed, including interfaces with police and other security services; g. panic buttons and \"silent\" emergency alert measures are implemented (e.g., key codes to alert security in the event of a hostage situation); Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 7 - Security How the facility perimeter is defined may vary based on the nature of each specific facility and therefore should be determined by risk assessment and approved by the NAC. 7.2 Information Security 7.2.1 A policy and procedures are in place to identify sensitive information. The information generated by an organisation can be as valuable and/or dangerous as the poliovirus materials stored at the facility. Adequate measures to prevent the unauthorized release of such information are critical. Procedures addressing information security should consider: a. the secure storage of all sensitive written records and data (e.g., virus inventories, security plans, security inspection reports, design drawings, maintenance plans, human resource information including worker contact details), including electronic records and electronic signatures; b. computer security, including robust Internet firewalls and encryption protocols; c. strict policies regarding PCs, laptop computers, storage media and cameras, among others, entering or leaving the facility; d. compliance with local and national laws regarding information security; e. the thorough destruction of paper files to be discarded, and complete erasure of unwanted electronic files. 7.2.2 A review and approval process is used to control access to sensitive information. 7.3. Personnel Control 7.3.1 A personnel reliability pol icy is defined and implemented. The nature and extent of the measures required for the personnel reliability assessment should be determined as part of the risk assessment process. The organization should ensure that unescorted access to poliovirus containment areas is limited to personnel who have been screened for subversive behaviours/associations or criminal records. Personnel who have not be screened (as in the case of visitors, contractors, etc.) should be accompanied at all times by authorized individuals. Factors screened for should include: a. association with organizations that could present a threat to the integrity of the facility; b. previous involvement in scientific misconduct or fraud; c. criminal records and financial probity; d. medical conditions , both mental and physical, that could lead to unstable/undesirable behaviour; e. dependency on drugs or alcohol. Facilities should consider including Insider Threat Awareness training for all personnel with access to the containment facility as a part of their standard training schedule. 7.3.2 The organization ensures that personnel access to facilities or work is controlled, according to the policy. 7.4 Personal Security 7.4.1 A policy is in place to provide personal security awareness training, where appropriate. Documented security drills and exercises are conducted and prepare personnel to learn from any deficiencies. 7.5. Contractors, Visitors and Suppliers 7.5.1 The organization ensures that suppliers, contractors, visitors and subcontractors adhere to the requirements of the management systems and do not compromise the facility's biorisk management system. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 8 - Facility Physical Requirements Element 8 - Facility Physical Requirements The Facility Physical Requirements element sets standards for how to assess the influence of the physical charact eristics of the facility on biorisk. Change in biorisk could arise due to previously unidentified shortcomings or changes in the building, equipment or scientific programme. Issues addressed include identifying the people who need to be involved and consul ted, incorporating biorisk into planning, approaching commissioning in a structured way (including the role of suppliers), considering the physical characteristics of the facility and carrying out any certification that may be needed. Sub-elements 8.1 Planning, Design and Verification 8.2 Commissioning and Decommissioning 8.3 Infrastructure and Operational Management 8.1. Planning, Design and Verification 8.1.1 A formal planning, design and redesign process is adopted for the facility, based on an assessment of risk associated with the materials to be used and activities undertaken. A formal design process means a structured and documented approach, where the needs of the facility are determined through risk assessment. The design process incorporat es engineering and operational solutions that are consistent with the risk posed by poliovirus materials to be stored and handled in the facility. Additional design measures to address facility biorisk control can be found in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition Associated Monograph: Laboratory Design and Maintenance [40]. Suitability of new facilities as well as retrofitting existing facilities are determined based on risk assessment. Factors to consider include, but are not limited to: a. adjacent spaces and whether adequate separation from the rest of the facility can be achieved; b. entry and e xit control; c. location of equipment including BSCs; a. ability to meet waste management requirements; d. isolation of HVAC to maintain containment; e. provisions for Building Management System in case of an alarm; f. redundancy for emergency planning, such as an on- site generator; g. the ability for equipment to fit throug h doors and be moved through corridors due to space considerations. Refurbishing of existing facilities should achieve the same final performance standard as constructing a new facility. 8.1.2 The design process identifies and incorporates all relevant legislative requirements, recognized standards, considers guidelines from the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition and associated monographs [26] , industry good practices and facility -specific risk assessments. The design process consider s relevant legislation and codes of practice (including building codes as well as those related to facility biosafety and biosecurity) and is based on the facility -specific risk assessment. The design process should also, when applicable, consider needs for compliance to Good Manufacturing Practise (GMP). The requirements identified from these sources are incorpora ted into the design plans. The design is fully documented, including a description of the tests and standards of acceptance to ensure required performance. The process is documented and transparent to provide assurance that it has been comprehensive and thorough. 8.1.3 The design process identifies and facilitates consultation with all relevant parties associated with the facility and its operation. The design process include s identifying and consulting relevant stakeholders involved in the planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the facility. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 8 - Facility Physical Requirements The following roles and groups should be considered for information, requirements and consultation: a. scientific personnel and other end users; b. the biorisk management advis or and biorisk management committee; c. biosecurity and/or security personnel; d. designers (architects and engineers); e. contractors; f. maintenance engineers; g. material and equipment suppliers; h. commissioning agents; i. certifiers; j. regulators including National Regulatory Authorities ; k. NAC; l. first responders; m. other relevant parties identified in risk assessments. A peer review process involving independent, competent third parties from the roles listed above should be conducted to ensure the design specifications meet requirements . 8.1.4 All design features, construction techniques, materials and equipment selected are documented in line with the needs of the design specifications. 8.1.5 New construction and physical facility modifications , including refurbishing and retrofitting, are carried out according to an approved plan. 8.2 Commissioning and Decommissioning 8.2.1 A formal process exists for the initial commissioning of facilities and the final decommissioning of facilities. Commissioning will ensure that the facility is constructed and performs as designed. The commissioning and decommissioning process starts at the design phase, during the first stage of the programme of work definition, to ensure the expectations for the building are achievable. The commissioning plan is developed in detail in parallel with the physical concept to ensure the expectations for the building are measurable. The commissioning plan clearly identifies all the commis sioning steps from beginning to end, providing examples and including the conditions of acceptance of each step as a prerequisite for proceeding to the next. The commissioning plan identifies all steps required before operation is commenced or resumed aft er any temporary shutdown. The commissioning process provides the benchmark for acceptable facility operation and the description of the programme to be put in place to maintain that level of performance. The decommissioning process identifies the decontamination procedures and security -related measures that must be in place for temporary or final shutdown of the facility. The decommissioning programme describes not only the procedures but also the standards of acceptance when those procedures are performed. This may be documented through clearance certificates and permits to work, which identify when and under what conditions the decommissioned facility can be re- entered. 8.3 Infrastructure and Operational Man agement 8.3.1 Facilities, equipment and processes are safely and securely designed and operated. With respect to b iorisk management, t he poliovirus facility incorporates features that are guided by biosafety and biosecurity risk assessments for the loss of poliovirus from containment . Facilities should consider the risk assessment guidelines set forth in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual Fourth Edition and associated monographs [26] when determining infrastructure and operational needs . Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 8 - Facility Physical Requirements 8.3.2 Poliovirus facilities are either poliovirus dedicated or non- dedicated laboratories . Non- dedicated facilities must demonstrate effective segregation and decontamination procedures between work with poliovirus and other pathogens to prevent cross -contamination. 8.3.3 Existing facilities must provide a containment perimeter sealable for fumigati on and with sealed penetrations to prevent uncontrolled outward airflow irrespective of the choice of primary containment. New facilities and those undergoing retrofitting or refurbishing must ensure the sealable containment perimeter, irrespective of the choice of primary containment . If subsequent renovation, decommissioning or repurposing of a poliovirus facility (and its containment perimeter) is planned and fumigation of the duct work cannot be conducted, a comprehensive risk asses sment and control plan should be developed for alternative decontamination of the containment perimeter, including the exhaust ventilation system from the f register to the downstream side of the HEPA filter , utilizing validated decontamination methods equipped a provide an alternative fumigation of HEPA filters , provided the filter is autoclaved or incinerated immediately on- site. The BIBO system is designed to allow removal and replacement of HEPA filters while maintaining containment of the caisson. 8.3.4 The use of devices (e.g., BSCs) that are validated to maintain primary containment are required for all procedures using live poliovirus unless otherwise specified (Element 8.3.16) . 8.3.5 Controlled entry into the containment perimeter is through a double- door personnel airlock. Features include alarms, interlocking doors or an equivalent system to ensure that more than one door cannot be opened at a time and associated operating procedures to ensure the building systems function effectively at all times. Anterooms , material airlocks, and personnel airlocks for entry are considered to be within the containment perimeter, must be sealable for fumigation and meet all requirements of spaces wit hin the containment perimeter. 8.3.6 All containment facilities where live poliovirus is stored, handled, treated and disposed of must be marked with biohazard signs. Signs are posted in prominent locations at the entry to the working area where poliovirus is being stored, handled, treated and/or disposed of and that only authorized personnel are permitted to enter. An emergency contact phone number must be displayed at all times and kept up to date. 8.3.7 Handwashing sinks operated by a hands -free mechanism with ru nning water and soap are provided within and near the exit of the containment perimeter. 8.3.8 Controlled exit from the containment perimeter includes appropriate steps and procedures to prevent exposure to contaminated PPE or personnel. Procedures for exiting the containment perimeter and the requirement for an exit shower must be determined by a facility -specific risk assessment. 8.3.9 All exits are clearly marked. Emergency exit doors from the containment perimeter are alarmed. 8.3.10 The controlled air system maintains directional airflow via a dedicated ventilation system with ductwork sealable for fumigation, HEPA filtration of exhaust, backflow protection on supply, and monitors/alarms to ensure directional airflow can be readily validated. For facilities working with small quantities ( volume and concentration) of poliovirus alternative mitigation measures may serve as a substitute for HEPA filtration of exhaust as determined by a risk assessment approved by the NAC. Use of supply -side HEPA filters directly on the containment perimeter in the absence of downstream interconnections, if correctly maintained and routinely tested, is functionally equivalent to providing a dedicated ventilation system. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 8 - Facility Physical Requirements When BSC exhaust air is discharged through the building exhaust air system, the air handling system should be designed so it does not disturb the air balance of the BSC or of the room i n which the cabinet is located. 8.3.11 The decontamination of all effluent (including emergency shower water, eyewash, handwash, unsterilized autoclave condensate) from within the containment perimeter is achieved through a validated inactivation procedure. Backflow prevention is implemented on all liquid services/utilities passing across the poliovirus containment boundary and measures to prevent release through traps, sinks and emergency shower drains. Non-dedicated effluent treatment systems must include appropriate mitigations for cross- contamination risk as determined by a risk assessment approved by the NAC. 8.3.12 The decontamination of materials exiting the containment perimeter is achieved through a validated sterilization/decontamination procedure or otherwise meets the standards for transport described in Element 12 Transport Procedures. Guidance on sterilization/decontamination procedures are available in Element 11 Decontamination, Disinfection and Sterilization. Examples include: a. a pass -throu gh autoclave with a bioseal, interlocking doors to prevent opening the clean side prior to cycle completion, sterilization of air discharge, cycle recording mechanisms and alarms; b. a material airlock/decontamination chamber sealable for fumigation ; c. a dunk t ank containing sufficient active compound to inactivate poliovirus. d. validated procedures for inactivating the contents of a full holding tank/container containing live poliovirus prior to disposal due to product failure, contamination, or other reasons (i.e., sterilize in place or other methods). 8.3.13 Kill-tank rooms or equivalent must meet all construction, sealing, and HVAC requirements of the primary containment space and are required to have an anteroom/personnel airlock for controlled entry as d escribed in Element 8.3.5. Kill-tank rooms should ensure that any relevant or appropriate risk mitigation measures as determined by risk assessment are in place to ensure that any spill or leak from the kill -tank can be responded to in a safe and timely manner. Such mitigations may include: a. berms; b. leak detection systems or alarms ; c. sump pumps; d. any additional mitigations that allow for safe and timely response to kill- tank system leaks 8.3.14 Storage of poliovirus must be performed under appropriate containment conditions as outlined in Sub- element 10.5 Storage Procedures . 8.3.15 Manufacturing process es and transfer of intermediates must be carried out in closed systems that have been leak tested and validated. Consideration should be given to the use of vision panels to allow visual monitoring of activities in the laboratory and production areas inside the containment facility. Other devices such as closed- circuit television cameras may be effective alternatives where vision panels are not appropriate. 8.3.16 A poliovirus animal facility will incorporate features according to risk assessments and will m eet all poliovirus containment criteria as described in this biorisk management standard, including: 1. complying with containment criteria for animal facilities, consistent with all other controls outlined in this document; 2. specially training and supervising personnel responsible for safe handling of poliovirus infected animals, including inoculating, harvesting, sampling, performing animal necropsies, and for any other manipulations so as to prevent personal injury and exposure; 3. requiring the use of devices (e.g., BSCs, flexible film isolators, or local exhaust ventilation) that are validated to maintain primary containment for all animal manipulations with live poliovirus . Specific manipulations that cannot be performed Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 8 - Facil ity Physical Requirements within primary containment without in creasing the risk to the lab worker may be performed outside of primary containment devices as determined by a risk assessment with enhanced mitigation procedures approved by the NAC ; 4. handling infected animals as poliovirus infectious materials and housing them in primary containment, separate from uninfected animals; 5. ensuring provisions are in place to manage animal associated waste according to this standard; 6. maintaining barriers to prevent infected animals f rom escaping and from introducing poliovirus to unexposed animals ; 7. maintaining accurate records and accounting for all infected animals and their final disposition; 8. meeting international criteria and country -specific requirements for laboratory animal care; 9. using security procedures specific for facilities housing animals involved in biomedical research. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 9 - Equipment and Maintenance Element 9 - Equipment and Maintenance The Equipment and Maintenance element ensures that biorisk management is considered during the selecti on of all equipment that a ffects risk. Emphasis is placed on equipment selection, the maintenance equipment inventories , and control over where the equipment may be moved and what it will be used for. Attention is also given to ensuring the equipment functions properly by following regular and predictive maintenance, supported by plans to prepare for, and recover from, breakdowns. 9.1 Maintenance, Control, Calibration, Certification and Validation 9.1.1 Documented procedures are established and executed to ensure equipment and physical components of the facility that may influence biorisk are maintained, controlled, calibrated, validated , and certified in a manner consistent with the requirements of the biori sk management system and this standard . 9.1.2 Due to their criticality in maintaining containment, biological safety cabinets (BSCs) and other primary containment devices will be certified on a regular schedule in accordance with relevant national standards. If the primary containment device has no relevant standard against which it can be certified, it must be tested at regular intervals to ensure primary containment is maintained based on use and appropriate risk assessment of non- conformity. The results of these tests must be documented. The equipment maintenance programme should apply to all aspects of the physical structure (including finishes and seals, where appropriate) and equipment therein. All materials used should be specified to ensure they can perform in line with predetermined criteria. An appropriate maintenance plan will be addressed as part of that specification process. Maintenance In planning and conducting maintenance activities, the organization should consider: a. adequately maintaining the physical integrity of the facility and its fi xtures and fittings; b. ensuring that the risks associated with the work have been subjected to a risk assessment and that competent individuals perform the maintenance activities; c. ensuring adequate controls are in place to prevent maintenance workers from be ing exposed to poliovirus during their work; d. identifying and recording maintenance requirements during the construction of facilities or when equipment is purchased/acquired; e. creating and maintaining a maintenance register for all applicable equipment; f. identifying and conducting planned maintenance activities at an appropriate frequency; g. ensuring capacity for unplanned (breakdown) maintenance so the integrity of the facility is maintained at all times or that work is stopped if facility integrity cannot be maintained; h. determining and monitoring predictive maintenance requirements and associated indicators and monitors; i. ensuring essential spare parts are available in line with a frequency appropriate to the risk of failure and need for replacement; j. establishi ng a pest control programme. Control In planning and conducting equipment controls, the organization should consider: a. identifying equipment to match work needs, which can be demonstrated as fit for purpose; b. controlling the purchase/acquisition of equipment to ensure all necessary risk assessments are completed and approval is authorized by competent personnel; c. controlling the entry and exit of equipment to and from the poliovirus facility, including decontamination requireme nts (e.g., air locks and decontamination); d. ensuring the asset, validation, and calibration register is regularly updated; e. ensuring stocks and supplies of equipment are sufficient. Calibration In planning and conducting calibration activities, the organiz ation should consider: Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 9 - Equipment and Maintenance a. identifying and documenting calibration requirements at the time of purchase/acquisition; b. identifying the standards/tests to use to ensure the equipment is correctly calibrated; c. establishing procedures to conduct calibrations on equipment used in live virus areas; d. ensuring calibration is scheduled and conducted in line with manufacturer requirements and/or at other specified intervals as identified by risk assessments. Certification In planning and conducting cert ification activities, the organization should consider: a. identifying and recording certification requirements at the time of purchase/acquisition of equipment, including relevant and current standards against which to certify; b. ensuring competent and independent certifiers are used for the certification process; c. ensuring certification is scheduled and conducted in line with manufacturer requirements and/or at other specified intervals as identified by risk assessments. BSC certification should be conducted according to an appropriate national standard, such as EN 12469, British Standards Institution (BSI), Deutsche Industries Norm (DIN) , National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), or other equivalent standard as outlined in the WHO Technical Report Series 1016 and 1028 [41, 42] . Validation In planning and conducting validation activities, the organization should consider: a. identifying and recording validation requirements at the time of purchase/acquisition; b. identifying the standards/tests to use to ensure the equipment is correctly validated; c. creating and maintaining a validation register for all applicable equipment; d. ensuring validation is scheduled and conducted in line with manufacturer requirements and/or at other specified intervals as identified by risk assessments; e. ensuring competent and objective validation mechanisms are used for the validation process. For physical security systems, the analogous concept is performance testing and evaluating the entire physical security system (equipment, policies, procedures and people) to ensure the system works as designed. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 10 - Poliovirus Inventory and Information Element 10 - Poliovirus Inventory and Information The Poliovirus Inventory and Information element examines the systems in place to identify, record and review the poliovirus material stored in, received by and transported from a facility. The capabilities of the system depend on the nature of the facility and ranges in complexity fr om simple lists to secure databases. This element also examines the way materials are stored, including segregation, labelling systems and controls of stocks of cultures. Sub-elements 10.1 Inventory 10.2 Information and Records 10.3 Transfer of Poliovirus Materials 10.4 Monitoring and Control 10.5 Storage Procedures 10.1 Inventory 10.1.1 An accurate and up- to-date poliovirus materials inventory is established and maintained. The inventory maintenance process should be based on risk and include: a. identifying all poliovirus materials held, including cultures, specimens and other sources (e.g., infected tissues/samples or animals); b. storing poliovirus material as outlined in the requirements of this biorisk management standard; c. ensuring stored samples of wild and Sabin poliovir us materials are segregated from each other and other isolates, cell lines, cultures or other materials that could be subject to cross - contamination or misidentification; d. ensuring the movement of poliovirus materials to and from storage meets the standards of Element 12 Transport Procedures; e. ensuring the surfaces of all storage vessels are decontaminated with a validated method for inactivating polioviruses; f. restricting access to poliovirus materials to authorized individuals with a demonstrable legitimate need; g. implementing effective physical security measures according to risk (e.g., locks, alarms, access controls); h. developing and maintaining a reliable sample identification system; i. segregating and storing poliovirus materials according to risk; j. determining what materials should be controlled (e.g., seed stocks, working stocks, infected animals) and what level of information should be captured in the inventory for these materials. 10.2 Information and Records 10.2.1 Records related to the poliovirus materials inventory are current, complete, and stored securely with adequate backup provisions . Inventory information should include: a. the name(s) and contact information of the individuals(s) responsible for the poliovirus material, and the details of other personnel with access to the poliovirus materials or the immediate area based on the level of risk; b. restricted access to the detailed inventory records to only those individuals who are authorized to have access to that information; c. legible and robust identification numbers and other relevant identifiers; d. records of quantities of poliovirus materials (number of containers/vials or applicable equivalent) at an appropriate level and based on risk, exact location of storage; e. ability to ac count for materials at all times; f. data on origin, including geographical source and date of collection; g. records of materials removed from storage to conduct work, and the fate of those materials and any newly developed stocks (consumed, destroyed, removed from the facility, returned to storage) following the completion of the work. 10.3 Transfer of Poliovirus Materials Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 10 - Poliovirus Inventory and Information 10.3.1 Transfer of poliovirus materials between laboratories within the facility or into and out of the facility are recorded and controlled. Material containing live poliovirus to be removed from the containment perimeter adheres to the requirements outlined in Element 12 Transport Procedures. Facilities should put c ontrols in place to ensure that documented assurances are received to guarantee that requests for poliovirus materials originate from legitimate facilities. Material may be brought into the facility or sent elsewhere only if authorized by those responsible for the facility. For material s deemed to be of high risk, more stringent controls, including shipment tracking and verification of receipt, may be necessary. More detailed guidance on transport procedures can be found under Element 12 Transport Procedures as well as in international s ample transport regulations . 10.4 Monitoring and Control 10.4.1 The inventory is reviewed at predetermined intervals and at a level based on risk so that materials can be accounted for in an appropriate manner. The system for inventory and associated controls should be matched to the nature of the material held and the risk of harm should it be misplaced or removed with the intention of misuse. Poliovirus inventories should be monitored so that materials missing or unaccounted for are quickly identified. Procedures should be in place to investigate potentially missing poliovirus materials. An inventory review should be conducted at least annually. 10.4.2 Measures are put in place to minimize the quantities of poliovirus materials in the inventory . The organi zation should demonstrate proactive measures to reduce risk through the elimination, substitution or minimization of volumes/quantities of poliovirus materials used and the number of manipulations conducted. Materials no longer needed should be identified for destruction, consistent with the goal of reducing amounts of live poliovirus materials to the lowest level possible. An inventory review should be conducted at least annually. 10.5 Storage Procedures 10.5.1 Areas used for the storage of poliovirus materials are secured against entry by non- authorized personnel as outlined in Element 7 Security. 10.5.2 For secondary (back -up) storage locations where poliovirus material such as stocks or equivalent are not normally used, the NAC may approve storage in leak -proof containment containers within a dedicated freezer that is subject to labelling requirements, security and access restrictions appropriate for the storage of poliovirus materials , as determined by facility risk assessment. 10.5.3 Storage of poliovirus must be performed under appropriate containment conditions as determined by a risk assessment approved by the NAC. Any derogations applied for and accepted by the NAC will be reflected on the certificate scope and associated certificates and will be regularly reassessed. 10.5.4 Movement of stock to and from storage locations outside the containment perimeter must be in line with the requirements outlined in Element 12 Transport Procedures. 10.5.5 The poliovirus material storage area must be equipped with a back -up emergency power source and with recording and alarm systems to monitor freezers. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 11 - Waste Management, Decontamination, Disinf ection and Sterilization Element 11 - Waste Management, Decontamination, Disinfection and Sterilization The Waste Management, Decontamination, Disinfection and Sterilization element describes the procedures necessary to ensure that appropriate decontamination, disinfection and sterilization routines contribute to managing the risk presented by poliovirus and work activities undertaken. The element addresses general requirements for procedures, training and waste management as well as more specific issues, including the potential need for specialized laundering, animal facilities, and inactivation of poliovirus material for work outside the poliovirus containment perimeter . Sub-elements 11.1. Management of Biological Waste 11.2. Inactivation of Poliovirus Materials and Decontamination of Facilities 11.3. Poliovirus Material Inactivation for Conducting Work Outside the Poliovirus Containment Perimeter 11.4. Decontam ination of Equipment Prior to Servicing or Removal 11.1. Management of Biological Waste 11.1.1 The organization establishes and maintains an appropriate waste management policy for poliovirus materials. No viable poliovirus will be released from the facility unless it adheres to the requirements outlined in Element 12 Transport Procedures. Potenti al routes whereby viable poliovirus could unintentionally exit the facility are identified and adequate prevention measures put in place through risk assessment. The organization should have an implemented waste management policy including validated procedures for the decontamination of poliovirus -containing waste. The following elements should be considered for a waste management policy: a. ensure a programme is in place to minimize waste production; b. ensure effective waste audit trails are in place and doc umented; c. provide facilities and procedures for the storage of waste (including short -term storage) that meet the requirements of this standard; d. ensure methods are available to effectively segregate and decontaminate mixed waste (e.g., biohazardous and rad ioactive waste); e. ensure waste is packaged to contain the waste and to maintain its integrity during storage and transport. 11.1.2 All contaminated or potentially contaminated waste (including those that may result from an emergency) has been identified and docum ented. All waste is managed according to the waste management policy. Sources of contamination that should be considered include: a. personnel; b. clothing and PPE; c. glassware; d. equipment; e. cultures and associated materials; f. spill clean -up materials and equipment; g. microbiological specimens; h. paper and plastic waste; i. needles, syringes and sharps; j. wastewater, including that from sinks and showers; k. air; l. filters and air handling systems; m. decommissioned equipment used in the facility; n. animals exposed to poliovirus; o. animal carcasses , cages or housing, and bedding; p. facility surfaces. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 11 - Waste Management, Decontamination, Disinfection and Sterilization All potential waste streams and other sources of contamination should be identified and documented. Potential routes whereby viable poliovirus could unintentionally exit the facility as result of an emergency should be planned for (e.g., including downstream sewage diagrams in emergency plans) as outlined in Element 13 Emergency Response and Contingency Planning. Potentially contaminated personnel may include core personnel working within the facility, contractors and emergency response personnel. Cultures and associated materials may be a source of contaminated supernatants, aspirates and culture media. Infected biological materials may also include infectious human, animal or plant specimens. In some instances, contaminated dedicated equipment, such as fire- fighter apparel or ambulance tools, may need to be held on- site if they cannot be effectively decontaminated. For each of these sources, facilities should implement procedures to validate the decontamination regime. R ecords should demonstrate that no contaminated persons or materials leave the facility and that inactivation measures have been implemented effectively. 11.2. Inactivation of Poliovirus Contaminated Materials and Decontamination of Facilities 11.2.1 Procedures are established and maintained to ensure appropriate disinfection and decontamination methods are chosen and implemented effecti vely. 11.2.2 Procedures are established, validated and maintained for the effective poliovirus decontamination of the facility and equipment . 11.2.3 Procedures are established to manage waste generated by emergencies, accidents and other incidents. The following aspects of inactivation of poliovirus contaminated materials and facility decontamination should be considered: a. Heat sterilization (autoclaving) is the preferred method to inactivate polioviruses. b. Decontamination SOPs are available to address both routine and non- routine activities (e.g., daily routines versus major spills). c. SOPs are developed to respond to the failure of the decontamination procedure or equipment. d. SOPs are validated in- house and shown to be effective against poliovirus prior to their use. The validation process includes the use of positive and negative controls. e. All materials leaving the containment perimeter, including clothing and liquid/solid waste, excluding materials packaged according to Element 12 Transport Procedures , are heat sterilized or subject to chemical , gaseous, or vapor treatment of proven effectiveness prior to their removal. f. Any poliovirus materials inactivated for future use and/or equipment leaving the containment perimeter are accompanied by documentation of their decontamination. g. Any live poliovirus that may be removed from the facility will be taken via a dunk tank, decontamination chamber or other validated mechanism to ensure the disinfection of the exterior surfaces of any packaging materials used. h. The facility inactivates all waste and potentially contaminated material before it is passed to contractors or other third parties for waste disposal ; excluding those materials packaged according to Element 12 Transport Procedures . 11.2.4 Procedures are established and maintained to ensure the complete inactivation of poliovirus from all materials and liquid/ solid waste streams leaving the containment perimeter using validated methods excluding those materials packaged according to Element 12 Transport Procedures . The procedures cover normal conditions as well as response to failure of the decontamination procedure or equipment . The organization should ensure data are available to demonstrate that the methodology selected can inacti vate the poliovirus materials under the specific conditions encountered in the facility. Validation measures should consider such issues as: a. the nature of the material being treated (e.g., volume, presence of protein/other potentially inhibitory substances ); Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 11 - Waste Management, Decontamination, Disinfection and Sterilization b. contact times and material compatibility issues (e.g., interaction with stainless steel or rubber seals); c. potential health hazards associated with the disinfectant; d. the need to maintain the required level of active compound, considering deterioration due to time and temperature. Validation of decontamination and/or inactivation should be repeated at least three times to validate the process and should be performed using the type of matrix containing the poliovirus material (i.e., solid, liquid, stool samples, animal carcass, waste culture media with serum, water containing decontaminating chemicals). Validations can be performed on loads meant to mimic operational status using non- contaminated materials and appropriate surrogates, such as G. stearothermo philus or another poliovirus surrogate as approved by the biosafety advis or. Examples of methods that demonstrate the validation of poliovirus material decontamination include but are not limited to: e. Autoclave cycles that are validated by placing s everal G. stearothermophilus biological indicators throughout the load of material that will be autoclaved. Cycles validated using the largest load capacity of the autoclave can be used for smaller loads. Biological indicators should be run periodically in autoclaves to verify continued efficacy over time. f. Batch tank liquid effluent decontamination system cycles that are heat -based and validated using G. stearothermophilus biological indicators at high, medium and low liquid levels inside the tank. g. Continu ous flow liquid effluent decontamination system cycles that are heat -based and validated using G. stearothermophilus spores (captured in effluent prior to release). h. Batch tank liquid effluent decontamination system and continuous flow liquid effluent decontamination system cycles that are chemical -based and validated using an approved surrogate for poliovirus that is not pathogenic for humans or hazardous to the environment. For each system effluent is captured and tested prior to release to the environment . i. Gaseous/vapor (i.e., hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, formaldehyde, etc.) room/enclosure decontamination system cycles should be validated using the biological indicator type, placement strategy and number of biological indicators recommended by the equipment manufacturer. j. Chemicals used for surface, equipment, waste or spill decontamination, and the required concentration and contact time should be validated as effective for inactivating poliovirus. Tests described in the European Standards EN 14476 (liquid phase) [43] or EN 16777 (stainless steel carrier disk) [44] can be modified for testing chemicals for poliovirus inactivation. k. Sterilization -in-place (SIP) system cycles should be validated using an approved surrogate for poliovirus that is not pat hogenic for humans or hazardous to the environment. Samples are collected at the end of the cycle and tested prior to release of material to the environment. l. Incinerator cycles should be validated per the manufacturers operating instructions . In planning and conducting decontamination activities, the organization should consider: m. ensuring all disinfectants used contain sufficient active compound to address the working conditions under which they will be applied, and such concentrations are maintained throughout the process, including conducting specific validation activities where necessary; n. providing adequate facilities and procedures for the storage of waste (including short -term storage); o. ensuring methods are available to effectively decontaminate mixed waste (e.g., infected animals that have received radioactive materials); p. ensuring methods are available, where appropriate, to decontaminate sensitive equipment not suitable for autoclaving (e.g., computers); q. implementing monitoring measures to ensure the methods have been effective (e.g., cycle recording and the use of indicators in autoclaves); r. decontaminating protective clothing by appropriate means prior to leaving the facility; s. ensuring adequate methods and resources are available t o deal with routine work and any spillages or other incidents during the handling and transport of materials inside and outside the facility; t. implementing programmes to ensure the amount of contaminated waste is minimized. Routine v erification of a validated decontamination process can utilize physical parametric monitoring (e.g., temperature, time, pressure, pH) to verify the decontamination was completed successfully. Initial validation of these processes must still be performed with biological indicators or appropriate surrogates as described above. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 11 - Waste Management, Decontamination, Disinfection and Steriliz ation 11.3 Poliovirus Material Inactivation for Conducting Work Outside the Poliovirus Containment Perimeter 11.3.1 Procedures are established, validated in- house and maintained to ensure appropriate inactivati on methods are chosen and implemented effectively for poliovirus material that is to be inactivated for future use. Each individual conducting a poliovirus material inactivation procedure must verify the inactivation procedure was successful the first time they conduct the procedure. 11.3.2 The result s of any inactivation for conducting work outside the poliovirus containment perimeter are recorded, including d ocumentation of 1. the material owner; 2. date of inactivation; 3. material description/identity and destination; 4. inactivation method used and how it was validated; 5. contact information of the individual conducting the inactivation or the owner of the material ; 6. any other relevant information. The organization should ensure data are available to demonstrate that the methodology selected for inactivation of poliovirus enables inactivation under the specific conditions encountered in the facility. Validation data should be in the form of more than one independently performed assay and preferably performed by more than one trained individual. The organization should have a notification and response process in place in the event poliovirus containing material is removed from the poliovirus containment perimeter and later found to contain infectious poliovirus. Inactivation methods should take into consideration: a. the nature of the material being treated (e.g., volume, presence of organic material/other potentially inhibitory substances); b. compatibility of the inactivation process with the work to be conducted on the material (e.g., need to retain antigenic structur e or nucleic acid sequences); c. potential health hazards and disposal requirements associated with the inactivation process (e.g., chemical, heat, other hazards). Examples of methods of poliovirus material inactivation include but are not limited to treatment by: a. heat; b. nucleic acid extraction ionizing radiation; e. germicidal UV light; f. combinations of the above methods (e.g., heat treatment followed by filtration or chemical lysis followed by filtration). The validated inactivation procedure should contain positive and negative controls. It should consider the limit of detection and ef fect of residual inactivation material on the viability of the biological system used in the validation assay. The validated inactivation procedure provides a process in which treated poliovirus materials no longer contains detectable: a. viable poliovirus, with efficacy established by viability testing data; or b. poliovirus nucleic acid that is capable of producing infectious forms of virus, with efficacy established by infectivity testing data. Examples of methods that demonstrate the validation of poliov irus material inactivation include but are not limited to culture of the treated material in permissive cells and observing for cytopathic effects/cell death . Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 11 - Waste Management, Decontamination, Disinfection and Sterilization 11.4 Decontamination of Equipment Prior to Servicing or Removal 11.4.1 Procedures are established, validated and maintained to ensure equipment, tools and other similar items are appropriately decontaminated before they are serviced in the lab or removed from the poliovirus containment perimeter . If equipment cannot be decontaminated for servicing , equipment must be serviced within the containment perimeter under the same containment requirements and protective measures as when the equipment is used in operation 11.4.2 Equipment , tools , or other treated items cannot be serviced or removed from biocontainment until the validation tests demonstrate there is no live poliovirus present. The result s of any equipment decontamination are recorded, including d ocumentation of 1. the equipment owner; 2. date of decont amination; 3. equipment description /identity and destination; 4. decontamination method used and how it was validated; 5. contact information of the individual conducting the decontamination; 6. any other relevant information. The organization should ensure data are available to demonstrate that the decontamination process selected is capable of inactivating poliovirus and the process was properly conducted. A copy of the documentation of decontamination should accompany any ite m being serviced or transferred out of the poliovirus containment perimeter . Decontamination methods may include poliovirus inactivation methods described in Element 11.3.1 Poliovirus Material Inactivation for Conducting Work Outside the Poliovirus Cont ainment Perimeter and should be chosen based on: a. compatibility of the decontamination process with the item to be decontaminated (e.g., can it be subjected to a chemical decontaminant or autoclaving, is a vapor or gas decontaminant required to permeate areas that cannot be wiped down with a chemical); b. potential health hazards and disposal requirements associated with the decontamination process (e.g., chemical, heat, other hazards). Examples of methods of decontaminating equipment, tools or similar items are provided below but are not limited to treat ment by: a. heat; b. chemical wipe down; c. gaseous/vapor decontamination; d. heat and pressure, as in sterilization- in-place (SIP). The decontamination process should be validated for the equipment, tools or items being treated (e.g., biological indicators used during autoclaving, biological indicators used during vapor/gas decontamination, swab samples taken from the most likely place of contamination following chemical wipe down or SIP). Time required for validation is dependent on the validation SOP and m anufacturer instructions (e.g., for biological indicators ). Items should be maintained in such a way as to prevent any potential contact or contamination by poliovirus containing materials until validation tests results are complete and the item can be serviced or removed. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 12 - Transport Procedures Element 12 - Transport Procedures The Transport Procedures element outlines how an organization deals with issues associated with the internal and external transport of biological materials. The necessary roles and responsibilities, materials and equipment as well as the need to work with speciali zed couriers are examined. Sub-elements 12.1 Transport Procedures 12.2 Transfer Approval 12.1. Transport Procedures 12.1.1 Procedures for the safe and secure transport of cultures, speci mens, samples and contaminated and potentially contaminated materials, both inside and outside the facility containment perimeter, are established by risk assessment and maintained in accordance with national and international legal requirements for the tr ansport of dangerous goods. In planning and conducting transport activities, the organization should consider: a. ensuring preparation of samples and transport requirements are identified and implemented, including legal requirements and national and international guidelines; b. ensuring transport within the facility is in sealed, appropriately labelled, surface decontaminated, leak-proof secondary containers by trained staff only; c. ensuring adequate packaging systems, materials, labels, PPE and documentation are available and used as part of the transport process; d. selecting a specialized carrier that is qualified to document and handle the package safely and securely; e. using document controls that allow the traceability of material movements into and out of the facility; f. identifying and implementing adequate and proportionate emergency response and contingency plans associated with the transport of poliovirus materials. g. communication with the receiving entity prior to transport and confirming recei pt after transport The organization should also consider: a. determining whether a request for poliovirus materials is being made by an approved facility (i.e., a facility certified for handling or storing poliovirus material ) for a legitimate reason; b. ensuring controls are applied to the importation of material to the facility; c. ensuring that material may be brought into the facility or sent elsewhere only if authorized by those responsible for the facility. General guidance on transport can be found in the WHO Guidance on regulations for the Transport of Infectious Substances 12.2. Transfer Approval 12.2.1 Transfer of poliovirus materials to another containment facility is executed under controlled conditions according to national regulations and international agreements after authorization by the receiving PEF. The relevant NPCCs are notified of any transfer of poliovirus collections to be included in the poliovirus survey and inventory activities; relevant NACs are notified of any poliovirus material transfer that could change the scope of facility certification. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 13 - Emergency Response and Contingency Planning Element 13 - Emergency Response and Contingency Planning The Emergency Response and Contingency Planning element examines the structures and mechanisms in place to cope with working outside normal operating conditions and how to react proportionally to emergency situations. Issues addressed include physical requirements, emergency communications, decision- making authorities, the development of simulations, testing of emergency scenarios and capacity of personnel, facilities and protective and rescue systems. Detailed guidance on emergency management for poliovirus exposure can be found in Public Health Management of Facility Related Exposure to Live Poliovirus [29] . Sub-elem ents 13.1 Emergency Scenarios 13.2 Emergency Response and Planning 13.3 Emergency Plans 13.4 Emergency Exercises and Simulations 13.5 Contingency Plans 13.1. Emergency Scenarios 13.1.1 All credible and foreseeable emergency scenarios that may impact the organization's handling of biorisks must be identified. It is unlikely that all potential emergency scenarios will be credible, but all reasonable ones should be considered and recorded. Where appropriate, the rationale for dismissing any issue should be provided. Scenarios considered should include: a. an infected/potentially infected worker or other contact (e.g., family member, emergency responder or community member); b. accident or medical emergency of a worker within the containment perimeter and need for evacuation; c. a major spillage/aerosol release; d. the potential loss of poliovirus materials through theft or any other reason; e. unexpected virulence (of unknown biological agents or of biological agents expected to be non- infectious ); f. fire; g. flood ing; h. explosion; i. a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake, extreme weather conditions, disease pandemics); j. breach of security; a. suspicious packages, including quarantine areas and appropriate explosive stand -off; k. utility failure including electricity, gas, steam and water supplies; l. physical facility and equipment failure, including a control system failure of the disinfection regime; m. environmental release through loss of containment; n. an act of terrorism or deliberate vandalism or extortion. 13.2. Emergency Response P lanning 13.2.1 Plans and procedures are established and maintained to: 1. identify and assess risk for incidents and emergency scenarios involving poliovirus and other hazardous materials; 2. prevent their occurrence to the degree possible ; 3. respond to emergency situations; 4. report any exposure or breach of containment involving poliovirus materials to the relevant national authorities ; 5. limit the likelihood of illness or other damage that may be associated with the emergency situation. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 13 - Emergency Response and Contingency Planning 13.2.2 Emergency planning covers all aspects of biorisk and includes general safety, security and medical issues. The organization must demonstrate that there are linkages between the response and contingency plans addressing containment breaches in place at the facility l evel, as verified by the NAC. Guidance on handling a human exposure or infection related to a spill or breach of containment involving poliovirus is detailed in Public Health Management of Facility Related Exposure to Live Poliovirus [29]. This document outlines the reporting mechanism and c riteria for a notifiable event per Annex 2 of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) [24] and should be incorporated into facilities emergency planning and response. 13.3. Emergency Plans 13.3.1 Biorisks are considered when preparing and implementing emergency plans. A system in accordance with national and international legislation is in place to effectively manage incidents that are determined by the organization to be significant poliovirus exposures, including: 1. implementing measures to prevent exposure of unimmunized individuals, including exposure to stool and associated waste; 2. educating individuals under investigation, their family and close contacts on the risk of poliovirus infection to t he community, the procedures for diagnosis and the precautionary measures required to prevent possible transmission; 3. initiating procedures to determine whether exposed individuals are infected, by collecting and testing nose, throat and stool specimens daily for a minimum of seven days post -exposure; 4. communicating with relevant national , regional and local officials; 5. disinfecting areas potentially contaminated by infected individuals within the facility. Detailed guidance on the handling of facility -associated poliovirus infections can be found in Public Health Management of Facility Related Exposure to Live Poliovirus [29] , which includes guidance on meeting these requirements and should be incorporated into facilities emergency planning and response. The organization should ensure that plans address the following needs at a minimum: a. identifying those responsible for devising, implementing and testing the control measures specified, along with ensuring their conclusions are effectively communicated to all relevant personnel; b. ensuring the legality and enforceability of proposed emergenc y response plans; c. responding during emergencies occurring outside working hours as well as those occurring during normal working hours; d. providing for periods of reduced staff availability (e.g., during weekends and holiday periods); e. ensuring emergency access/exit, including the ability to override access controls as appropriate; f. providing emergency exit routes that avoid evacuating people through containment areas; g. providing for the safe removal, transport, transfer, treatment and accommodation of contaminated persons and objects; h. informing visitors and contractors about emergency response plans and the possible consequences of exposure; i. ensuring adequate supplies of PPE and disinfectants in the event of a large spill or outbreak situation. 13.3.2 Control measures in place are demonstrated as being reasonable and proportionate to the scale and nature of the emergency. 13.3.3 Emergency plans are effectively communicated to all personnel and relevant third parties and tested with the goal of making everyon e aware of their roles and responsibilities . In the event of an emergency, it may be necessary to involve parties external to the organization. Based on the credible scenarios identified, the organization should identify and communicate with Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 13 - Emergency Response and Contingency Planning such agencies to establish their role in responding to a gi ven situation. The organization may choose to sign memoranda of understanding or agreements with key local responders. It may also be necessary to inform and educate such parties on their role and any risk (including exposures) they may face. Additionally, the organization should take steps to reasonably ensure their actions will not unnecessarily increase the risk associated with the emergency (e.g., uncontrolled use of water for fires). The organization should coordinate with local or national authorities to implement surveillance plans in response to an incident or emergency. Contact information should be documented and made available to personnel responsible for coordinating the emergency response activity. External agencies that should be consulted could include: a. police and security services; b. fire services; c. ambulance and local hospitals/healthcare providers; d. transport providers/couriers; e. local and national government officials; f. environmental authorities; g. local utilities authorities, including sewage and power; h. the WHO. 13.4. Emergency Exercises and Simulations 13.4.1 Structured and realistic emergency exercises and simulations, including security drills, are conducted at regular intervals, based on risk, to test the emergency plans, prepare personnel and learn from any good practices or deficiencies identified. Facilities should cooperate with external agencies, such as local health authorities and emergency services, to ensure coordination of outside resources. The NAC may serve in an advisory capacity. Exercises should be planned to realistically represent the events simulated. The results of an exercise should be documented and reviewed for lessons learnt, and feedback on performance should be provided to all relevant personnel , including senior management . Any resulting actions should be recorded and allocated to named individuals, and measures should be put in place to ensure they are closed out as specified in Element 1. 15 Corrective Action. 13.5. Contingency Plans 13.5.1 In the event of an emergency, adequate contingency measures are in place to ensure the safety and security of continued operations. Normal operating conditions may be disrupted in the event of an emergency or unforeseen event. This could range from safely shutting down work during a power failure, to obtaining alternative storage conditions in the event of a breakdown. Such eventualities should be considered proactively, and contingency plans put in place. Activities should address the need for adequate redundancy, replacement and other measures, which could involve the availability of alternative facilities or personnel, the introduction of backup systems (e.g., power supplies), alternative means of decontaminating materials in the event of the failure of critical systems or equipment (e. g., kill tanks or autoclaves), maintaining containment for injured/ill workers in an emergency, or the complete safe shutdown of operations in extreme situations. Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAP IV) Element 14 - Accident/Incident Investigation Element 14 - Accident/Incident Investigation The Accident/Incident Investigation element addresses activities that define the facts and circumstances related to an unwanted event, determine the causes and develop remedial action to control biorisk and prevent recurrence. This element examines the organization's reporting and investigation syst em in place. 14.1. Accident/Incident Investigation 14.1.1 Documented procedures are established and maintained to define, record, report, analyse and learn from accidents and incidents involving poliovirus materials. Facilities should implement procedures to ensure that definitions for what constitutes an accident or incident are clear and communicated to all relevant personnel. Incidents may include events of exposure and accidental release. Accidents and incidents provide an indication that the systems designed to manage biorisk may have failed, so it is essential that lessons be learnt and improvements made where possible. The accident/incident investigation process should at a minimum: a. create a culture of self -reporting incidents, including \"near misses\" and incidents that may trigger an investigation or emergency response; b. identify personnel responsible for maintaining the ac cident/incident reporting system; c. define what triggers recording and reporting, with emphasis on events that may result in exposure to live poliovirus (e.g., needle sticks, spills, splashes, sprays, leaks, aerosol generating events); d. define what constitutes a significant poliovirus exposure (e.g., ingestion) and thresholds for initiating procedures to determine whether individuals are infected; e. specify required documentation to support the system, as well as the frequency and distribution of reports generated and communicated to relevant personnel; f. identify the reports that will be generated, as well as their frequency and distribution; g. designate time to di scuss relevant incidents and near misses with management; h. establish a poliovirus incident evaluation/r esponse team (composed of facility medical, public - health and polio- specific expertise) that determines whether an exposure is significant, reports its findings to the designated senior manager and recommends such actions as deemed necessary; i. establish and publicize 24- hour accident/incident reporting channels and identifying those responsible for maintaining the system; j. ensure necessary reporting to the appropriate national authorities as outlined in the in Public Health Management of Facility Related Exposure to Live Poliovirus [29] ; k. ensure an analysis of trends; l. identify root causes using individuals trained in investigation techniques; m. provide feedback to staff at regular intervals and action- tracking mechanisms to ensure lessons learnt result in action to avoid repeating such events and/or to minimize their potential impact; n. identify where security professional s may be required to coordinate with law enforcement.
