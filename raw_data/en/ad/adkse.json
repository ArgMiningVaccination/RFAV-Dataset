Furthermore, in most cases the impact of genetic variation on severity of disease and treatment outcomes remains unknown. Therefore, the NHLBI has recently created the Trans Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, which aims to utilize high throughput omics to characterize a variety of HLBS diseases. TOPMed is well on its way to collecting whole genome sequence from over 130,000 well- phenotyped individuals and is currently generating high -throughput expression and other \"omics\" data (e.g. RNA, DNA methylation, metabolites, and proteins) from many of these individuals to complement whole genome sequence information. Having produced an unprecedented volume of high -throughput data, TOPMed now seeks to turn its attention to effectively leveraging this resource through novel systems biology analyses to uncover disease pathobiology. Although lower costs and technological improvements in sequencing technology have vastly expanded our ability to generate large volumes of omics data, the ability to analyze such large datasets to extract biologically meaningful insights from them remains challenging. Systems level models incorporating trans -omics analyses will be an important step in uncovering the underlying biological networks, gene -gene and gene -environment interactions influencing disease and treat ment outcomes. Thus, advanced analyses that incorporate genotype and phenotype datasets from thousands to tens of thousands of individuals are required to move TOPMed to the next phase of discovery. 099803 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Palliative Care in Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Diseases National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/NIH/DHHS NOT - HL-20- 737 07-May -2023 Not Specified Contact Name Lora Reineck, MD, MS Contact Telephone 301-435-0222 Contact Email lora.reineck@nih.gov Sponsor Website Program URL Link to program URL Deadline Dates (ALL) 07-May -2023 , 05-Jun-2023 Synopsis Providing care that is consistent with a patient's values, preferences, and goals is a cornerst one of palliative care, an interdisciplinary patient -centered approach that aims to improve quality of life for persons with advanced illness and their families. Palliative care focuses on several objectives including relief of symptoms and suffering, comm unication of prognosis and treatment options in the context of patients' goals, and coordination of care within and across healthcare settings. Palliative care is not synonymous with hospice or end- of-life care. Rather, palliative care addresses the spectr um of care for serious illness from diagnosis through terminal stages of diseases. Moreover, palliative care does not necessarily entail withholding or curbing treatment. Relief of symptoms, enhancing quality of life, and many other specific aspects of goal- 43NIH Funding Opportunities SPIN ID Program Title Sponsor Name Sponsor Number Deadline Date Funding Amount NIH Funding Opportunities Due: May 2023 concordant care may, in fact, involve optimal medical or surgical treatment of diseases. The expected outcome of integrating palliative care into the management of the patient's disease is a better quality of life, a realistic understanding of risks and benefits of treatment and interventions, and medical treatment decisions that align with the patient's goals, preferences, and values. Many heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) diseases, including heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, life-limiting, non-curable illnesses. These and other HLBS diseases may benefit from care focused on improvement of symptoms and quality of life, in addition to care focused on slowing or halting progression of diseases. Integration of palliative care into cardiology, pulmonary, hematology, and critical care practice is recommended by multiple professional societies. Additionally, symptoms of HLBS diseases such as cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue may be especially burdensome, even in diseases that are not life-limiting. Research to improve burdensome symptoms has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for all patients with HLBS diseases, not just those with life-limiting disease. 107287 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Heart, Lung, Blood and Sleep Focused Ancillary Studies to Large Ongoing Clinical Studies (Revised) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/NIH/DHHS NOT - HL-21- 030 07-May -2023 Not Specified Contact Name Jue Chen, Ph.D. Contact Telephone 301-435-0550 Contact Email jue.chen@nih.gov Sponsor Website Program URL Link to program URL Deadline Special Interest (NOSI) seeks to expand the breadth of scientific research on the clinical course, prevention and treatment of diseases within the mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) by leveraging ongoing clinical research studies through ancillary studies.

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications from early and mid- career investigators (i.e. postdoctoral fellow/associates - associate professor) who strive to expand their research trajectories through the acquisition of new knowledge and skills in the areas of therapeutic drug, biologic, or device development. The development of novel treatments for pain, addiction, and overdose is a vital component to address the ongoing opioid epidemic. This development will be most effective if performed by scientists with experience in translational science. Translation is defined as the process of turning observations in the laborat ory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public \u2014 from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes, with translational science representing the field of investigation focused on understanding the scientific and operational principles underlying each step of the translational process (https://ncats.nih.gov/translation). Traditional academic training provides deep knowledge of a relatively narrow scientific discipline. While doma in expertise is an important characteristic of a proficient translational scientist, a comprehensive understanding of the stages of therapeutic development is also necessary. For many scientists, acquiring needed expertise through participatory involvement in the various fields that are required to compile an investigational new drug (IND), investigational device exemption (IDE), or new drug application (NDA) is extraordinarily difficult given the diversity of these domains. This FOA is designed for early - and mid- career scientists with pain or opioid abuse expertise interested in receiving hands -on experience in translation at an industry laboratory, or an academic or government research center performing therapeutic development activities. The selected research environment should have the requisite capabilities and employ scientists and staff with expertise across the entire translational s pace for small molecule, biologic, or device development.

Despite having better molecular understanding of lung and HN cancers and improved therapies for affected patients, these tumors remain a major health problem in the United States (US) and globally. While molecular markers of early injury of the aerodigestive epithelial field have been found, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that initiate these preneoplasias and drive their progression to invasive cancer. In addition, growing evidence highlights the importance of the interaction between the immune system and cancer development. In recent years, immune -based therapies (especially, checkpoint inhibitors) have come to the forefront of standard therapies for many malignancies including lung and HN cancers. However, little is known about the immune regulation of premalignancy, including lung and HN preneoplasias. A functional understanding of the key molecular and cellular changes involved in the formation and advancement of lung and HN preneoplasias will enhance our knowledge of oncogenic progression and accelerate development of effective, rationally designed, preventive and therapeutic strategies. 103983 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Public Policy Effects on Alcohol -, Cannabis -, Tobacco -, and Other Drug -Related Behaviors and Outcomes National Institutes of Health/DHHS NOT -AA- 21-028 07-May -2023 Not Specified Contact Name Gregory Bloss, M.A., M.P.P.

The use of highl y sensitive hCG assays allows the detection of pregnancy earlier in gestation than the time of clinical recognition, and gives an even higher estimated loss of 50-70% of conceptions prior to the second trimester. To achieve a successful pregnancy, a series of strict embryonic and maternal conditions must be met, that include high quality embryos, favorable conditions for embryo implantation, receptive maternal endometrium and optimal uterine environment to sustain the conceptus to term. In addition, materna l immune tolerance and hormonal factors play a critical role. While approximately half of all cases of EPL appear to be due to embryonic aneuploidy, very little is known about the physiologic and pathophysiologic processes that underlie non-aneuploid EPL. As a result, there is also a lack of understanding for the underlying causes of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). This NOSI seeks to address these critical knowledge gaps by encouraging basic, translational and clinical studies on biological processes that may uncover potential etiologies of EPL and RPL. This includes research to understand implantation mechanistically and identify a range of key factors, involved in implantation and placentation that are important for early pregnancy establishment, including abnormalities that contribute to sporadic EPL and recurrent pregnancy loss. 115062 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): argeting the Endocannabinoid System for Brain Health and Acute and Chronic Diseases National Institutes of Health/DHHS NOT -DA- 22-048 07-May -2023 Not Specified Contact Name Yu (Woody) Lin, PhD Contact Telephone 301-435-1318 Contact Email ylin1@mail.nih.gov Sponsor Website Program URL Link to program URL Deadline ID Program Title Sponsor Name Sponsor Number Deadline Date Funding Amount NIH Funding Opportunities Due: May 2023 Synopsis This Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) encourages studies of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and its roles in brain health and acute and chronic disease, substance use, and substance use disorder (SUD).

Stigma contributes to a lack of attention to drug use screening, inadequate outreach to people who use drugs (PWUD) and insufficient uptake of services to prevent, treat, or mitigate HIV infection (and related consequences of drug use) among PWUD. Stigmas of interest include: internalized stigma among drug users, stigma associated with providing services to PWUD, and stigma toward PWUD by providers or service settings. Policies and practices that create or augment stigma also are of interest here, as well as stigma experienced by providers who might otherwise broaden their services to PWUD. Stigma reduction interventions for HIV service settings have been developed and, in some cases, implemented on a wide scale, but generally target sexual transmission as the primary behavioral risk; however, knowledge from this work can inform stigma among PWUD. Large literatures on stigma also exist in a variety of other conditions (e.g., cancer, mental illness) which also can provide conceptual and programmatic bases to speed the development of new interventions addressing PWUD. 107248 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Improving Outcomes in Cancer Treatment - Related Cardiotoxicity National Institutes of Health/DHHS NOT -CA- 22-001 07-Mar- 2023 Not Specified Contact Name Cryst al Wolfrey Contact Telephone 240-276-6277 Contact Email wolfreyc@mail.nih.gov Sponsor Website Program URL Link to program URL 309NIH Funding Opportunities SPIN ID Program Title Sponsor Name Sponsor Number Deadline Date Funding Amount NIH Funding Opportunities Due: May 2023 Deadline Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) is to encourage collaborative and innovative approaches to mitigate cardiovascular dysfunction while optimizing cancer outcomes by understandin g the mechanisms of cancer treatment -related cardiotoxicity and translating the findings to improve risk stratification, early detection, prevention, and management. 107483 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Mechanistic Studies on the Impact of Substance Use in Sex and Gender Differences in HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders National Institutes of Health/DHHS NOT -DA- 22-047 07-May -2023 Not Specified Contact Name Contact Telephone Contact Email Sponsor Website Program URL Link to program URL Deadline Dates often more likely to develop HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments.

Thus, the goal of this NOSI is to encourage and facilitate scientific discovery for drowning prevention, specifically aimed at reducing drowning risk and improving outcomes in three primary domains. Domain 1: Understanding drowning disparities and developing drowning interventions to address these disparities. Rates of drowning vary significantly. Reasons contributing to drowning risks among certain populations are multifaceted and likely related to access and exposure to water, knowledge and skills around water, and behaviors and beliefs. Research evaluating both structura l and/or systemic forces which contribute to disparities in drowning risk among children, parents and communities is needed. Development of effective interventions aimed at addressing these factors as they pertain to drowning prevention is critical. Domain 2: Studying the effects of swim instruction on swim skills to prevent drowning. Swim skills, which are often obtained through swim instruction, can decrease drowning risk; however tremendous variability among types and techniques of swim instruction exist s. Validated measures which consistently assess swim skill efficacy to prevent drowning at differing ages and developmental abilities are lacking. Metrics which help to identify effective, quality swim instruction to prevent drowning are needed. The develo pment of evidence -based best practices as to when and how to instruct populations most at risk for drowning (such as children of young age, of certain races/ethnicities, with intellectual or developmental disabilities, or those with linguistic or cultural differences), is essential. Domain 3: The adoption, integration and sustainable scale -up of the drowning chain of survival. The five steps of drowning chain of survival can reduce drowning mortality. These steps include: (1) preventing drowning, (2) recogn izing distress, (3) providing flotation, (4) removal from water and (5) providing care as needed. Depending on the water source, interventions which constitute these layers of drowning protection exist. Research to advance the adoption, integration and sustainable scale -up of evidence -based drowning prevention interventions and the drowning chain of survival across families and communities is needed. 108897 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Assessment of Suicide Thoughts and Behaviors among Children and Preteens National Institutes of Health/DHHS NOT -MH- 22-086 07-May -2023 Not Specified Contact Name Eric R.
