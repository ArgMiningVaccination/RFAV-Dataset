Among the first health-related products to win FDA approval, Boroleum went on the market in 1906 and still soothes redness, itchiness and soreness under the nose and nasal passages, while moisturizing and protecting chapped lips. Since 1951, the garage-sized Boroleum packaging plant has been a rare industry amid golf courses in Long Island's old-money enclave of Fishers Island, a 45-minute ferry ride from New London. I'm Feeling Dizzy Nose NewsDizziness is as difficult to describe as it is to diagnose. Are you lightheaded? Do you feel like you're floating? Is the world spinning around you? Or have you lost your sense of balance? \"Dizziness is a symptom, not a diagnosis,\" explains Marc D. Eisen, M.D., Ph.D., direc - tor of Hartford Hospital's Hearing & Balance Center, newly opened in West Hartford's Blue Back Square in conjunction with Eastern Rehabilitation Network. \"It can be confusing and frustrating to discern the true complaint.\" Seniors with disequilibrium (dizziness) are at particular risk for falls. Dizziness often leads sufferers to a neurologist, pulmonologist or cardiologist, although Dr. Eisen, a fellowship-trained neurotologist who specializes in diseases of the ear, is a good place to start. The delicate apparatus of the inner ear governs both hear - ing and balance. The new center offers expert audiology (hearing tests and hearing aids), a dedicated dizziness clinic, balance-function tests, vestibular therapy (provided by Eastern Rehabilitation Network) and access to other medical specialties. An estimated 40 percent of those over 40 experience dizziness at some point in their lives. Viruses, autoimmune disease or other disorders can inflame the part of the inner ear called the labyrinth , a fluid-filled system that signals the brain to keep your balance when you move. Vestibular rehabilitation therapists offer techniques to help retrain your brain to restore a sense of balance. Vertigo makes you feel like the world is spinning. Benign positional ver - tigo, which creates a brief intense episode of vertigo, is effectively treated with physical therapy. Chronic or recurrent vertigo may be caused by M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, a debilitating disorder caused by fluid imbalance in the inner ear that causes episodic spinning vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The disease, which can be treated by inject - ing steroids or antibiotics into the ear, tends to affect one ear at a time, but typically leads to progressive hearing loss. Physical therapy, medications or surgery can provide relief from many hear - ing and balance disorders. Patients with single-sided deafness can now take advantage of an innovative bone-anchored hearing aid that conducts sound vibrations through the skull, while patients with severe to profound hearing loss in both ears can receive a cochlear implant. If you experience sudden deafness, contact your physician immediately, as hearing loss may be prevented if treated early and aggressively. \"Minimally invasive new treatments can help restore hearing and balance,\" says Dr. Eisen. \"Don't be afraid to seek help.\" The incidence of acne, the most common skin disorder, is on the rise in the United States. Accutane is prescribed for severe, potentially scarring acne after other treatment options have failed. Other treatments include oral antibiot - ics (usually at least two different oral antibiotics), creams and, for some women, birth control pills. While the typical patient taking Accutane is a teenager, some patients\u2014both men and women\u2014are older. Acne usually appears in adolescence, but one-third of adults still suffer breakouts. Acne can be permanently cured after a course of Accutane. \"At any given time, I have an average of 10 patients who are taking Accutane, and I have an extremely busy practice,\" says Lisa Kugelman, M.D. \"The Accutane course of therapy is 20 weeks. Approximately one-third are permanently cured after one course. Close to 100 percent are clear at the end of their 20 weeks of therapy. If acne does recur, in most cases it's much milder, and tends not to recur during the first year.\" Accutane causes birth defects if a woman becomes pregnant while taking the medicine. \"It has been on the market for over 25 years, and we know that there is no increased risk of birth defects after the medicine is stopped and is out of your system, which takes a month,\" says Dr. Kugelman. \"For that reason, every female of childbearing potential\u2014including 12-year-olds and 45-year-olds\u2014needs to be on two forms of contraception and have monthly pregnancy tests during their therapy. This is federally man - dated and monitored.\" Because Accutane users have also rarely reported symptoms of depression, it is not recommended in patients who are actively depressed. \"Mood changes associated with Accutane seem to be rare,\" adds Dr. Kugelman. \"Multiple studies have reported that the rate of depression in Accutane users is similar to the rate in the general population.\" The most common side effects are related to dryness\u2014 dry skin, chapped lips, eye irritation and dryness of the inner nasal membranes (leading to bloody noses). Side ef - fects go away when the medicine is stopped. Accutane can also cause temporary elevations in the triglycerides or liver enzyme tests. \"Taking Accutane is a big commitment,\" says Dr. Kugelman. \"It requires close monitoring\u2014monthly visits, consent forms and blood tests\u2014and having extremely Accutane: Attacking Acne chapped lips for 20 weeks is no fun. On the other hand, patients are glad they took it. A few patients who have a later recurrence of their acne may choose to take another course. It is considered safe to take up to three courses\u2014 beyond that, safety is unknown.\" 3Stress Signals Ellen Dornelas, Ph.D., is shown with a patient at the Cardiac Rehabilitation Program at Hartford Hospital. Dr. Dornelas is the author of Psychotherapy With Cardiac Patients .During life's inevitable stressful seasons, the body suffers as the mind battles anxiety or depression. A plunging stock market, job losses and terror attacks have shredded our sense of safe - ty, awakening primal fears. Sleep eludes us, dreams turn to nightmares, and worries about the future leave us distracted or distraught. Under constant stress, the body's normal defenses can go awry. Although everyone experiences stress when bad things happen, even joyful events like childbirth or a new job can trigger violent physical sensations. The body abruptly releases a rush of adrenalin and the heart pounds wildly. The adrenal glands begin pumping out massive bursts of hormones that spill into the bloodstream, affecting bodily functions like breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. Acute stress signals the hypothalamus to release neu - rotransmitters and hormones that tense the body for fight or flight. Over time, elevated stress hormones impair the regulation of blood sugar and blood pressure. High levels of cortisol, a stress hormone produced by the adrenal glands, raise blood glucose levels, weaken the immune system and disrupt the sleep-wake cycle. Stress and untreated depression produce subtle memory loss and attention problems as a flood of cortisol shrinks the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory. Sustained stress can be devastating to the heart. Suppressed hostility festers into cardio - vascular disease as cholesterol clogs arteries and inflammatory responses increase the stickiness of the platelets that form in blood vessels. \"There is substantial evidence that acute and chronic anxiety and stress do impact the heart,\" says Ellen Dornelas, Ph.D., director of Behavioral Health Programs, Preventive Cardiology, at Hartford Hospital. \"Patients often complain of the 'Sunday night blues' in anticipation of the work week. Sudden cardiac death occurs most often on Monday morning.\" Under Siege Challenges to the mind and body\u2014lack of sleep, a demanding boss, threat of a layoff or a loved one's illness\u2014leave our bodies constantly on high alert. Pain and inflammation may be the body's re - action to an overactive protective system that can damage its own tissues. Infection, aging, hormones and metabolic syndrome\u2014marked by obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood sugar\u2014spur the development of inflammation. Destructive signaling molecules called cytokines spur wayward inflammatory responses, contributing to the development of depression, asthma and degenerative diseases like arthritis. Stress is believed to play a role in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pain, eczema, psoriasis and irritable bowel syndrome. NIH researchers are studying why stress hormones exacerbate the symptoms of inflammatory diseases like lupus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. \"Stress does not cause someone to have an autoimmune disorder, but may exacerbate an underlying medical or psychological illness,\" explains David F. Tolin, Ph.D., director of the Anxiety Disorders Center at the Institute of Living (IOL). \"Stress hormones meant to play a defensive role can impair the immune system. Long-term stress contributes to cardiac risk, especially when someone has very little control over a high- demand job. People who describe their work as 'highly stressful' are more likely to have a major depressive episode.\" New research reveals a mysterious link between sleeplessness and heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. While nearly everyone experiences occasional insom - nia, nearly 70 million people in the United States suffer from sleep disorders. Chronic sleep depriva - tion affects appetite and metabolism, increasing the risk of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and heart attack. Psychiatric disorders like anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) leave sufferers sleepless and especially vulnerable to stress. \"Environmental stress can precipitate panic attacks, major depressive illness or schizo - phrenia in someone with a biological vulnerabil - ity,\" says Dr. Tolin. \"The onset of a mental illness often correlates with a stressful life transition.\" Gender Bias In women, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that stress acti - vates the brain's limbic system, associated with emotional responses, while men tend to show increased blood flow to the part of the brain responsible for the \"fight or flight\" response. Challenges to the mind and body\u2014lack of sleep, a demanding boss, threat of a layoff or a loved one's illness\u2014leave our bodies constantly on high alert. 5CLINICIAN PROFILE David F. Tolin, Ph.D. Although most people think of a middle-aged man as the typical heart attack victim, by age 65 one in three women have some form of cardiovascular disease. Women are particularly vul - nerable to stress caused by fluctuating hormones during puberty, pregnancy and menopause. Nearly half of women undergoing in vitro fertilization for infertility report symptoms of depression, anxiety, anger and isolation after unsuccessfully trying to become pregnant. Sudden emotional stress, such as learning of a loved one's death, can trigger life-threatening symptoms of a heart attack. The \"broken-heart syndrome,\" or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, typi - cally strikes grief-stricken elderly women who have no history of cardiac disease. \"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy results from acute physical or emotional stress,\" says Paul Thompson, M.D., direc - tor of the Division of Cardiology at Hartford Hospital. \"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy looks and acts just like a heart attack, but the cardiac changes often resolve within several days and the heart arteries are generally normal. It seems to be related to a surge of adrenalin or other stress hormones.\" \"There is evidence that stressful life events play a role in non-fatal cardiac events such as a first-time heart attack,\" adds Dr. Dornelas, author of Psychotherapy With Cardiac Patients. \"Many cardiac patients who have high anxiety levels come to therapy complaining of muscle tension, headaches, back pain, sleepless - ness and high blood pressure. Most people react to stressful life events with anxiety and some people are predisposed to respond to stress with heightened cardiac reactivity.\" Stress affects both body and mind. \"It is extremely difficult for people to practice relaxation techniques when they are acutely anxious,\" says Dr. Dornelas. \"Similarly, people with high anxiety levels may not get much out of to trying to learn to meditate or breathe slowly.\" De-Stress Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, has been shown to be an effective way to manage stress. People often respond to stress by overeating, smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, sleeping too much, avoidance and procrastinating. At Hartford Hospital's Anxiety Disorders Center, counselors talk to patients about their thoughts and feelings, helping individuals to identify cognitive distor - tions that leave them vulnerable to unhealthy behavior. \"We help people figure out what's causing their excessive stress reaction so they can take action,\" says Dr. Tolin. A recent Veterans Administration study found that the chronic stress of PTSD puts sufferers at risk for heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. PTSD triggers persistent frightening thoughts in those exposed to a threatening event or wartime or - deal. With funding from a Hartford Hospital grant and the Hospital Auxiliary, researchers at the Institute of Living purchased virtual reality equipment to simulate the sights, sounds and smells of Iraq. Combat veterans re-experience the sights and sounds of war David F. Tolin, Ph.D., is founding director of the Anxiety Disorders Center at the Institute of Living at Hartford Hospital. He is also adjunct associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. His work in the field of obsessive-compulsive disorders has been the subject of articles in the New York Times and Family Circle, as well as appearances on Good Morning America, the Today Show and the Oprah Winfrey Show. He co-authored Buried in Treasures: Help for Compulsive Acquiring, Saving, and Hoarding and Treating Trichotillomania: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Hairpulling and Related Problems. Dr. Tolin earned his doctorate in clinical psychology at the University of Arkansas and interned in clinical psychology at Tufts University School of Medicine/VA Medical Center in Boston. Before joining the Institute of Living in 2000, he was assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, and director of clinical trials at the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Tolin specializes in the study and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and panic disorder, as well as compulsive hoarding and body-focused repetitive behavior dis - orders such as trichotillomania. In his free time, he enjoys fly fishing and playing with his two young children. 6as a way to desensitize and integrate feelings through con - trolled exposure to traumatic memories. Homecoming sol - diers often remain hypervigilant, reliving the war over and over in their minds. Aggravated by alcohol, prescription drug abuse, broken relationships or family tension, PTSD is emotionally, psychologically and physically damaging. \"The mind runs amok when anxiety mounts,\" explains Dr. Dornelas. \"There is seemingly no end to the distorted thoughts and skewed cognitions stimulated by fear.

Rather than simply trying to relax, they can direct their efforts toward dealing with the stressful situa - tion by making sustainable behavioral changes.\" 7 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & Breakthroughs Food Fetish Garlic doesn't only protect against digestive cancers, but all types of cancer, including breast and pros - tate. The National Cancer Institute says the more raw and cooked garlic someone eats, the lower the risk of stomach and colorectal cancer. One study found that middle-aged women who regularly ate garlic had a 50% lower risk of developing colon cancer. Add crushed, fresh garlic to food or take enteric-coated supplements.Berry Benefits Among the most power - ful cancer-fighting foods is a small, purplish-black berry from the Amazon rain forest. University of Florida researchers showed that antioxidants in aca\u00ed (ah-sigh-ee) berries destroy cultured human cancer cells. The Brazilian berries contain vitamins A, C and E, selenium, essential fatty acids and more anti-aging flavonoids than red wine. Foods with rich, dark colors contain phytochemicals that protect against cancer.Pregnant Pause Pregnant women diagnosed with breast cancer are no more likely than similar young breast cancer patients to die or suffer a recurrence, a study at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center found. Researchers saw no evidence that tumors grew faster in pregnant women. While radiation should be postponed until after the baby is born, ultrasound, surgery and chemotherapy can treat the cancer without harming the fetus.Pacemaker for the Brain Deep brain stimulation improves Parkinson's disease significantly more than medication, reports the Journal of the American Medical Association. Implanting electrodes in the brain reduced tremors, rigidity and flailing of the limbs and improved move - ment and mobility, although 40% of patients suffered serious side effects, includ - ing falls. Parkinson's disease afflicts more than one mil - lion Americans.Wheat's Wrong: Celiac Disease Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by eating gluten, causes both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symp - toms. Gluten can silently and irreversibly harm the digestive tract by causing inflammatory injury to the lining of the small intestine in those unable to digest the protein, found in cereal grains like wheat, rye and barley, but not corn and rice. Oats are generally safe, but can cause symptoms owing to contamination with other grains. When the intestine becomes inflamed, it can't absorb food normally, and nutrients are lost through the small bowel. Celiac disease can lead to weight loss, decrease bone mineralization and cause diarrhea and iron deficiency. Sometimes the only signs are subtle\u2014mild gastric disturbances, bloating, gas, anemia, infertility or fatigue. The only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Celiac disease is so common that about one in every 100 people in the United States suffers from the autoimmune disorder. A genetic predisposition, exposure to gluten and certain infections all play a role. As many as 20 to 30 million Americans may have either no symptoms or only vague complaints that make the disorder difficult to diagnose. Celiac disease mostly afflicts people of English, Irish, Scandinavian, northern European and Algerian ancestry, and tends to run in families. The clinical spectrum of celiac disease is so varied that there can be a long lag time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis. The disease can usually be confirmed with antibody testing and an endoscopic biopsy performed with a flexible camera system that allows gastroenterologists to examine and biopsy the upper intestinal tract. \"Genetic testing can be used in addition to antibody tests, endoscopy and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions,\" says Hartford Hospital gastroenterologist Paul A. Shapiro, M.D. \"Many people with asymptomatic wheat sensitivity remain unaware that they have celiac disease because their complaints of bloating, diarrhea\u2014 or even heartburn\u2014are misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or gall bladder disease.\" \"The disease is a consequence of the genetic predisposition and inadequate digestion of gluten by human intestinal cells,\" adds gastroenterologist Avrum H. Blitzer, M.D. \"Perhaps an infection triggers an antibody response in someone with a genetic predisposi - tion, or it may be linked to the timing of introduction of solid food in infancy. More than half of those suffering from celiac disease don't have clear symptoms, so diagnosis is often an art. Some patients suffer from neurological problems, including difficulty with gait, neuropathy (tingling or numbness) or headaches, as well as infertility, diabetes or iron deficiency. Less than half have diarrhea.\" More and more restaurants are creating entr\u00e9es that reflect growing awareness of the disorder. The Max Restaurant Group, which includes Hartford's Max Downtown and Trumbull Kitchen, Avon's Max a Mia, Glastonbury's Max Amore and Max Fish, and West Hartford's Max's Oyster Bar, offers menu choices for celiac disease sufferers\u2014includ - ing gluten-free beer. Max's chef will present a selection of gluten-free recipes at a tasting event in April (see calendar, page 19). 8In the United States, as many as 10 million women and a million men are fighting a life-and-death battle with an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia. Millions more are struggling with a binge eating disorder. Nationally, 46 percent of nine-year-old girls are on diets and nine percent say they have vomited to control their weight. By the time they reach their teens, many are on a roller coaster of binge eating and crash dieting. \"Eating disorders disproportionately affect women,\" says Paula Holmes, MSN, CS, APRN, clinical director of the Eating Disorders Program at the Institute of Living, which offers a partial hospitalization program for adolescents and adults suffering from anorexia (restricting and/or purging to lose weight) or bulimia (binging and purging). \"Why do some people develop an eating disorder and others don't?\" asks Ms. Holmes. \"Genetics is part of the explanation. Some may have mood or anxiety disorders, or substance abuse problems. Cultural and media messages also influence the drive for thinness. Most often, food is used as a way of controlling feelings.\" Cognitive-behavioral therapy, combined with individual - ized counseling, helps people with eating disorders rethink their perfectionism and preoccupation with body weight When to Ask for Help and identify triggers that may cause those with bulimia and binge-eating disorder to overeat. Most eating dis - orders begin early in life. Counselors talk with patients about body image, helping individuals to recognize cognitive distortions that leave them vulnerable to unhealthy urges. \"Patients go on yo-yo diets and use binge eating as a way to cope with shame, depression, guilt or other emotional distress,\" explains Ms. Holmes. \"Bulimia is diagnosed when someone is overeating and then purging calories via induced vomiting or over-exercising, or by us - ing laxatives, diet pills, diuretics or herbal supplements.\" Unlike other eating disorders, binge eating afflicts both men and women more equally, well into adulthood, and is widespread among people of color and all socio - economic groups. Binge-eating disorder is more prevalent than both anorexia and bulimia. According to the National Institutes of Mental Health, surveys show that up to 5 percent of Americans experience episodes of binge eating. Binge eating correlates with neurobiological risk factors for both psychiatric disorders and obesity. Recent research reveals that more Americans are obese than overweight. Nearly two-thirds of the population is overweight or obese, and the majority are more than 20 percent above their ideal body weight. Obesity affects every organ system, disrupts endocrine function, weak- ens joints and contributes to diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Binge eating\u2014consuming unusually large amounts of food while experiencing a clear loss of control over the eating\u2014occurs in about a quarter of obese people. People who binge have a genetic vulnerability to obesity and are substantially more likely to also have greater body dissatisfaction and higher rates of psychological problems, such as depression, than their obese peers who don't binge eat. People may eat even when they're not hungry because they don't feel full, or may keep eating long after they're full and feel disgust or shame afterward. While overeating and inactivity account for weight gain, binge eating is driven by faulty brain circuitry, ac - cording to a new study. For some people, just looking at tasty images of food is enough to make them want to eat. \"People often use food to deal with stress,\" says Ms. Holmes. \"We can help them develop food plans. Exercise also helps. Overeaters Anonymous, a 12-step recovery program, can be beneficial. Breaking the cycle of binge eating and crash dieting is the first step toward emotional balance and maintaining a healthy weight.\"Binge, Purge, Starve 9Lead Lead passes freely from the mother's blood to her unborn child, where it can affect the developing brain. Lead, a potent neurotoxin, is banned in paints and glazes made in the U.S., but has been found in imported products, including lipsticks.Psychotropic medications \"A large number of pregnant women are taking antidepressant medications,\" says Hartford Hospital obstetrician- gynecologist Yu Ming Victor Fang, M.D. An estimated 500,000 women in the United States annually take medications for a psychiatric illness at some point during their pregnancy. Women taking psychotropic drugs when they become pregnant should not stop \"cold turkey,\" but should consult their doctor. When psychotherapy alone is insufficient, a drug can be prescribed that is less dan - gerous to the baby than the risks posed by the mother's untreated mental illness.Hartford Hospital's OB-GYN department provides specialized care for high- risk patients, cancer patients, pregnant teens and non-English speaking women, as well as diagnostic testing and prena - tal screening for genetic disorders. \"Use common sense during pregnancy,\" urges Merwood Jones, M.D., senior attending Alcohol Never drink alcohol during pregnancy, warns Dr. Jones. A single drink a week can cause fetal alcohol effects. For a pregnant woman, no amount of alco - hol is \"safe\" to consume. A study in Pediatrics found that pregnant women who drink as little as once a week are more likely to give birth to children who have behavior problems like atten - tion deficit and conduct disorders as teenagers.physician at Hartford Hospital. \"Don't smoke or drink alcohol, eat properly, don't overdo exercise, wear your seat belt, keep diabetes under control and see your physician early and regularly for prenatal care. Avoid prepared foods that may be high in sodium and instead eat fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables.\" Canned foods It's not just baby bottles that contain bisphenol A (BPA), under review by the FDA for a possible ban because of its potent effects on sex hormones. The chemical can leach into food from plastic-lined metal cans. Even at low doses, BPA blocks testosterone and mimics estrogen, and may damage the developing reproductive system. Cigarettes Studies show that cigarette smoking doubles the risk of miscarriage, low birthweight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). If you can't quit, at least cut down and enroll in one of the hospital's smoking cessation programs. Women smokers are at unique risk for pregnancy-related problems, osteopo - rosis, cervical cancer, impaired fertility and early menopause. Pregnancy Perils? 10Cat litter Pregnant women should wear gloves and change the cat litter daily to prevent the risk of infection by the toxoplasmosis parasite.Mercury For pregnant women, the risks of eat - ing fish contaminated with mercury, a brain-damaging neurotoxin, outweigh the heart-healthy benefits of omega-3 oils. The FDA warns women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant to consume no more than 12 oz. of low-mercury fish weekly. Avoid king mackerel, swordfish, bluefish, tuna and lobster. Soft plastics Flexible vinyl products contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals called phthalates, banned in Europe as \"toxic to reproduction.\" According to University of Rochester researchers, \"prenatal phthalate exposure at envi - ronmental levels can adversely affect male reproductive development in hu - mans.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 93% of Americans have the chemicals in their bodies.Sugar substitutes Pregnant women who avoid sugar should be alert to the artificial sweeteners used in diet soft drinks and sugar-free foods. The FDA says Splenda is safe, but recommends limiting consumption of NutraSweet and Equal. The American Pregnancy Association warns that Sweet 'N Low (saccharin) crosses the placenta and may remain in fetal tissue. Fragrances Air fresheners and fragrances contain phthalates, linked to urogenital deformi - ties as well as reproductive problems. Phthalates are often used in cosmetics, hairspray and shampoo to carry fragranc - es. Under current law, they can simply be labeled \"fragrance,\" even though they may make up 20% or more of the product. Cell phones Headsets worn away from the body minimize radiation exposure. Pregnant women may prefer to carry a phone in a purse rather than clipped to a belt worn next to the developing baby. Epidemiology published a study show - ing that 13,159 Danish children whose mothers used cell phones during preg - nancy were significantly more likely to develop hyperactivity, inattention and emotional problems. 11Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at (860) 545-1888 or (800) 545-7664 for information about any program.

Non Profit Organization U.S. Postage PAID Hartford, CT Permit No. 436180 S e y m o u r St r e e t Ha r t f o r d , Ct 06102-5037Cook's Circle Recipe analyzed by Brunella Ibarrola, MS, RD, CD-N.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly mist an 8 x 11-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking oil spray. Place the water in the pan and set aside. Slice the pears in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds using a melon baller, and, if desired, slice off the very top portion of the pear (including the stem). Place the pears face-up in the pan, taking care to lean them against each other as needed in order to keep them from tilting over too much. Fill the pear cavities with the dried fruit and set aside. Place the maple syrup and the cinnamon in a small bowl and mix well. Drizzle the mixture over the dried fruit in each of the cavities, and over the top surface of all of the pears. Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour or until the pears are very soft. Let cool 5 minutes and serve. Yield: 4 to 8 servings The Divine Pear \u00e0 la Mode: Serve each pear topped with a scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream or other light-flavored vegan ice cream.The Divine Pear Serving accessories can be purchased at the Hartford Hospital Auxiliary Gift Shop. Ingredients \u00bd cup water 4 firm pears \u00bd cup small pieces dried fruit (choose 1 or more of raisins, dried cherries, dried cranberries, chopped dates, etc.) \u00bd cup pure maple syrup \u00bd teaspoon cinnamonThe Divine Pear* is not only pretty, but also pretty unusual in that we don't come across baked versions of the curvy fruit every day. Consider it a light and sophisticated dinner party dessert. Do the prep in advance but wait until right before you start eating dinner before popping it in the oven. The heavenly aroma will inform you and your guests that it is indeed time for dessert. Recipes with lots of ingredients can look daunting and there - fore unappealing. Here's the good news. Scrumptious main dishes, lunches, drinks, salads, soups and more can be made with very few ingredients\u2014just four, to be exact. And when a recipe that tastes great and is easy to prepare also happens to contain just four ingredients, you know that it's going to be a winner. *From Glastonbury nutritionist and chef Maribeth Abrams' forthcoming book, 4-Ingredient Vegan, available for pre-order on Amazon.com.
