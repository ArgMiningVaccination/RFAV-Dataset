Yesterday, we taught you how to literally stretch toxins out of your body. Today, we're here to help you get rid of those negative thoughts that can creep through your head. You're awesome girl\u2014don't even doubt it! So wen \"I can't...\" or \"Screw this, I quit!\" inner rants start to plague you, do this mind trick from Sharon Salzberg, author of [Real Happiness: The Power of Meditation](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Happiness-Meditation-28-Day-Program/dp/0761159258). Close your eyes and tune in to your breath, thinking, Inhale-exhale. After a few minutes, imagine a knock at the door. Picture yourself opening the door to find your toxic thought in human form: Maybe it looks like your nasty boss or that credit-hogging coworker who stole your idea. Instead of slamming the door in its face, look it over and say, \"You can go now.\" Watch as it turns around and leaves. Notice how you feel (calm, strong, vindicated?), and carry that sensation with you as you open your eyes and return to reality. Better? Image "}
