Steven Lane Taylor, B.Msc. \"Holistic Spiritual Healing\" The word holistic has been described in numerous ways. When it pertains to the subject of healing, holistic is best defined as healing the whole person, whole signifying a trinity of the body, mind and spirit. It is the interaction between the body, mind and spirit that is the foundation of a holistic approach to spiritual healing. With so much emphasis on natural healing, it is important to note that the absolute form of natural healing is holistic and spiritual. This reference is to the concept of an indwelling natural intelligence within the body that can maintain good health, and can restore good health when the body is in need of healing. What we are speaking about is an inner natural healing intelligence that has the innate wisdom to run the body and to heal it when it needs healing. Your body is an energy field. The mind is also energy. In reality, your body is a body/mind energy field, or in an absolute sense, a field of mind energy. Mind energy is consciousness. Thus, your body could be described as a consciousness body or body of consciousness. Your body of consciousness is everywhere from the top of your head down the length of your body to the soles of your feet. To the outer physical senses, your body appears to be made up of physical solids and liquids, but appearance is deceiving. What you are actually looking at are fields of energy or fields of mind energy appearing as flesh, bones, cells, internal organs, blood, and so on. Your body consciousness is in a continual state of oneness with the universal consciousness of God. What this says is that your body consciousness is one with the consciousness of God and that this is a continual state. In an absolute sense, it is continual although at times, when there is the appearance of ill health, it will seem that something has interfered with the continuum. If the body is in full God consciousness, then good health will prevail. If the body appears to be in need of healing, the healing must be the healing of consciousness, or bringing the human mind consciousness back in tune with the realization that the body's consciousness is God's consciousness that is whole, meaning healthy. You should think of your body as having been made by God to express the perfection of God's consciousness in human shape, form, matter, and density. Your mind should accept that the natural state of your body is in good health because it is the consciousness of God, having individualized into human form. Holistic spiritual healing is based on this truth, for example, all is God, inclusive of the whole of your body. God's consciousness can exist simultaneously on many different levels or manifestations, such as human consciousness and physical body form. In holistic spiritual healing, there is a chain of command in the healing process. Spirit or universal mind energy affects the human mind energy level, which in turn affects the body energy level. The idea in holistic spiritual healing is to fill the human mind energy level with as much God energy consciousness as possible. The very presence of God's consciousness energy in the human mind level produces the inner mind instruction necessary to restore health or to cause healing. God's consciousness informs the human mind level energies what to do, and the human mind level energies direct the energy rhythms and motions of the body to make the adjustments necessary in the energy factors underlying ailing parts of the body. Each of the millions of cells of your body is a consciousness energy field. Each is, therefore, susceptible to the influence of energy consciousness. Every time you meditate, you surface more of God's energy consciousness into the human mind level energy. The human mind level of energy consciousness then directs the energies of your body for health maintenance and for healing where necessary. Therefore, meditation truthfully can be thought of as the ultimate holistic spiritual healing process. This is why people generally feel so much better after having meditated. It is because they are making more direct contact through the mind with the natural healing intelligence of God's consciousness to adjust the energies of the body to bring relaxation, peace, rejuvenation and revitalization. Holistically, spirit rules the mind, which in turn rules the body. Every cell of your body is a field of energy consciousness. God's presence is a consciousness of light. Visualizing that cells are filled with God's light energy consciousness affects the consciousness of cells. As you visualize, make an attempt to image or imagine cells filled with God's light energy. Believe that as this is happening, the energy factors of every cell are being adjusted precisely to the way that the energy should be working to have healing and health. If there is a specific part of the body that is experiencing physical ill health, try to visualize the cells in that part of the body being healed by the healing consciousness of God's light energy. Holistically, the whole is greater than its parts. Dr. Paul Leon Masters Reference: Text taken from Dr. Paul Leon Masters' \"The Theocentric Way of Life,\" Volume 3: Module 5.
