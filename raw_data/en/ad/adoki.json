Practitioners use acupuncture for relief and prevention of pain and for a variety of health conditions, including musculoskeletal pain, chronic headaches, arthritic conditions, anxiety disorders and depression, Parkinson's, stroke rehabilitation, asthma, fibromyalgia, chronic heart disease, digestive, gynecological and urogenital problems, and addictions (alcohol, tobacco, drugs). Craniosacral Therapy is a gentle, hands-on method of evaluating and enhancing the functioning of a physiological body system called the craniosacral system \u2014 comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. CST improves the functioning of the central nervous system and many other systems of the body, such as digestive, musculoskeletal, respiratory and circulatory, and has shown to help with the physical components related to post traumatic stress, depression and anxiety. Facial Rejuvenating Acupuncture treatment uses super-fine needles to target underlying health issues that may be contributing to a deficient facial appearance. The needles are placed into problem areas on the face and neck, such as wrinkles or acne scarring, to promote nutrient-rich blood flow, stimulate muscle activity and toning, and encourage collagen growth, which all contribute to a more youthful and healthy looking appearance. Feldenkrais Method is a somatic or body-oriented intervention that helps people reconnect with their bodies, learn ways to move with greater efficiency, and increase vitality, coordination, and achieve overall improved well-being. Holistic Dousing is a biofeedback system that enables your conscious mind to link with your higher self \u2014 your intuition. Using a dowsing tool, this holistic method helps bring you back into equilibrium. When your body is in balance it functions smoothly and is able to heal itself. Massage Therapy is the manipulation of soft body tissues (muscles, connective tendons and ligaments) to enhance well-being. It's effective for conditioning, stress, improved circulation and other health issues. Lymphatic Drainage relieves swelling that happens when medical treatment or illness blocks the lymphatic system. Lymphatic drainage massage involves gently manipulating specific areas of the body to help lymph move to an area with working lymph vessels, improving the flow of lymph fluid, and reducing swelling. Myofascial Release is gentle held pressure applied to the many layers of fascia that hold our bodies together but can be distorted by life's many bumps, bangs and injuries, and stay that way until released. Physical Therapy helps regain and restore movement and overall health, designing and monitoring a planned program using a holistic approach. Quantum Healing is thermal conductivity using a hertz frequency healing device to transfer heat. The heat accumulation helps to get through several layers of the body, improving circulation and breaking through fibrosis. When combined with massage and lymphatic drainage, the results are higher than using infrared radiation. Reflexology is a type of massage that involves applying different amounts of pressure to the feet, hands and ears. It's based on a theory that these body parts are connected to certain organs and body systems. Reiki Healing channels energy into the patient by means of touch to activate natural healing processes. It's effective in restoration of physical and emotional well-being. Tong Ren Therapy is a form of energy healing that opens and removes the blockages so the body can heal itself. Trigger Point Therapy releases or softens a muscle knot to reduce or eliminate the knot pain and associated pain. This release happens by applying various levels of pressure to muscle knots, and then stretching the affected areas through a complete range of motion. Tui Na is a form of massage and acupressure using rhythmic compression techniques to break down scar tissue, relax muscles and tendons, and open the energy pathways. Tui Na is effective in treating trauma and injury by clearing the energy pathway for improved circulation and to speed up the healing process. Zero Balancing is a mind-body therapy that uses gentle touch to reorganize the body's internal structure and energy to resolve unconscious tension patterns for relief of bodily discomfort and emotional distress.
