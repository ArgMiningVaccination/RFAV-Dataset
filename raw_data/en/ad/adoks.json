The office of magistrate has a history dating back to 12th Century England, when King Richard assigned knights the duty of keeping \"the King's peace.\" While the office of Justice of the Peace was a prestigious and honorable one for centuries, it was abolished in North Carolina in 1962 due to corruption, widespread lack of professionalism, and general disrepute. The old justice of the peace was replaced by the newly -created office of magistrate, sharing many of the same responsibilities but lacking the factors that eventually led to the downfall of the justice of the peace. A Constitutional Office For each county, the senior regular resident Judge of the Superior Court serving the county shall appoint from nominations submitted by the Clerk of the Superior Court of the county, one or more Magistrates who shall be officers of the District Court. The initial term of appointment for a magistrate shall be for two years and subsequent terms shall be for four years. The number of District Judges and Magistrates shall, from time to time, be determined by the General Assembly. . . . Vacancies in the office of Magistrate shall be filled for the unexpired term in the manner provided for original appointment to the office, unless otherwise provided by the General Assembly. NC Constitution, Art. IV, Sec. 10. Qualifications (a) In order to be eligible for nomination or for renomination as a magistrate an individual shall be a resident of the county for which he is appointed. (b) To be eligible for nomination as a magistrate, an individual shall have at least eight years' experience as the clerk of superior court in a county of this State or shall have a four-year degree from an accredited senior institution of higher education or shall have a two-year associate degree and four years of work experience in a related field, including teaching, social services, law enforcement, arbitration or mediation, the court system, or counseling. The Administrative Officer of the Courts may de termine whether the work experience is sufficiently related to the duties of the office of magistrate for the purposes of this subsection. In determining whether an individual's work experience is in Welcome to the Job - Page 1a related field, the Administrative Officer of the Courts shall consider the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities for the office of magistrate. G.S. 7A -171.2. Appointment The procedure established in the NC Constitution for appointment as a magistrate has been criticized as involving \"too many cooks.\" That procedure is set out in G.S. 7A-171(b) as follows: Not earlier than the Tuesday after the first Monday nor later than the third Monday in December of each even -numbered year, the clerk of the superior court shall submit to the senior regular resident superior court judge of the district or set of districts as defined in G.S. 7A -41.1(a) in which the clerk's county is located the names of two (or more, if requested by the judge) nominees for each magisterial office for the county for which the term of office of the magistrate holding that position shall expire on December 31 of that year. Not later than the fourth Monday in December, the senior regular resident superior court judge shall, from the nominations submitted by the clerk of the superior court, appoint magistrates to fill the positions for each county of the judge's district or set of districts. G.S. 7A -171: Term of Office (a1):The initial term of appointment for a magistrate is two years and subsequent terms shall be for a period of four years. The term of office begins on the first day of January of the odd-numbered year after appointment. The service of an individual as a magistrate filling a vacancy as provided in subsection (d) of this section does not constitute an initial term. For purposes of this section, any term of office for a magistrate who has served a two- year term is for four years even if the two- year term of appointment was before the effective date of this section, the term is after a break in service, or the term is for appointment in a different county from the county where the two -year term of office was served. . . . (c) If an additional magisterial office for a county is approved to commence on January 1 of an odd -numbered year , the new position shall be filled as provided in Welcome to the Job - Page 2subsection (b) of this section. If the additional position takes effect at any other time, it is to be filled as provided in subsection (d) of this section. (d) [Upon] a vacancy in the office of magistrate . . . the senior regular resident superior court judge shall appoint from the nominations received a magistrate who shall take office immediately and shall serve until December 31 of the even -numbered year, and thereafter the position shall be filled as p rovided in subsection (b) of this section. Were you appointed to ___ an empty position, ___ a newly -created position, ___ a vacancy (meaning the previous office-holder did not serve out the full- term) When did your term of office begin? __________________________________________ When does your term of office end? __________________________________________ If you are reappointed, will your next term be for two years or for four years? _________ Supervision The chief district judge . . . has administrative supervision and authority over the operation of the district courts and magistrates in his district. These powers and duties include, but are not limited to, the following: (4) Assigning matters to magistrates, and consistent with the salaries set by the Administrative Officer of the Courts, prescribing times and places at which magistrates shall be available for the performance of their duties; however, the chief district judge may in writing delegate his authority to prescribe times and places at which magistrates in a particular county shall be available for the performance of their duties to another district court judge or the clerk of the superior court, or the judge may appoint a chief magistrate to fulfill some or all of the duties . . . , and the person to whom such authority is delegated shall make monthly reports to the chief district judge of the times and places actually served by each magistrate. G.S. 7A-146. Note: Counties vary widely in procedures related to vacation leave for magistrates. Welcome to the Job - Page 3Training & Education Magistrates are required to satisfactorily complete Basic School in order to be eligible for reappointment. G.S. 7A -171.2. In addition, magistrates are required to attend at least 12 hours of training approved by the AOC for continuing education credit each biennium. (A biennium begins on January 1st each odd -numbered year and ends on December 31 st of each even- numbered year.) Most opportun ities for continuing education credit for magistrates are offered by the AOC and the SOG. The AOC provides extensive training opportunities related to technology for magistrates; additional information and class schedules are available through the AOC int ranet. In addition, the following regularly scheduled events are designed specifically to address magistrates' educational needs: Spring and Fall Conferences Jointly sponsored by the AOC, SOG, and the NC Magistrates' Association. (Each conference provides 12 hours of continuing education credit.) Judicial College Seminars Consisting of 2 -3 days of intensive small -group instruction, these seminars are offered annually on the topics of involuntary commitment, introduction to holding small claims court, a nd advanced small claims law. In addition, a Judicial College Seminar on a criminal law topic is offered each November, with the topics alternating between Advanced Criminal Procedure and DWI. (The November 2014 seminar will be the DWI seminar.) Course announcements and registration information are sent out to magistrates by email well in advance of each course. One -Day Regional Civil Seminars Conducted each fall in 4 -5 locations throughout the state. These seminars focus exclusively on small claims law and provide 6 hours of continuing education credit. There are numerous other training opportunities for magistrates offered by a wide variety of providers. Note that training offered by providers other than AOC and SOG must be approved in advance for continuing education credit; students should Welcome to the Job - Page 4carefully consult AOC policy, available on AOC intranet, concerning requirements for credit approval, and/or contact James Gray at AOC ( James.F.Gray@nccourts.org; 919- 890 -1110). Duties of the Office The NC Magistrates' Association summarizes the duties a magistrate may be authorized to perform as follows: Accept guilty pleas, admission of responsibility and enter judgment for Infractions Handle misdemeanor and infractions for cases involving alcohol, b oating offenses , state park/recreational areas , littering offenses , and w ildlife offenses (e.g., hunting, fishing, etc.) Accept written appearances, waivers of trial or hearing and guilty pleas and, in appropriate cases, enter judgment and collect fines, penalties and costs Issue arrest warrants Issue search warrants Grant bail or set release conditions (non- capital offenses) Hear and enter judgments on worthless checks (<$2000.00) Conduct initial appearances Serve as Child Support Hearing Officers Conduct small claims court in cases involving up to $10,000 Administer oaths Provide punishment for direct criminal contempt Take depositions and examination before trial Issue subpoenas and capiases Take affidavits for verification of pleadings Assign years allowances to surviving spouses and children Perform marriage ceremonies Take acknowledgment of written contract or separation agreement Accept applications for involuntary commitments Conduct hearing for driver license revocations Validate vehicle towing by law enforcement Validate impounding of vehicles in certain DWI/DWLR charges Issue temporary domestic violence protection o rders in certain emergency c onditions http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/magistrate/AboutUs/authority.htm Welcome to the Job - Page 5Removal from Office The grounds for removing a magistrate from office are \"the same as for a judge . . . . \" G.S. 7A -173(a). The grounds for removing a judge from office are: (1) willful misconduct in office, (2) willful and persistent failure to perform the judge's duties, (3) habitual intemperance, (4) conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, (5) conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. G.S. 7A -376(b). While the grounds for removing a magistrate from office are identical to those for removing a judge, the procedures are quite different. In the case of judges, complaints are considered by The Judicial Standards Commission, which in turn makes recommendations to the North Carolina Supreme Court, based on a written ethical code enacted by that Court termed the Code of Judicial Conduct . By contrast, neither the Commission nor the Supreme Court is involved in considering complaints against magistrates, although the Code of Judicial Conduct itself has indirect application as a primary source of determining whether particular conduct is \"prejudicial to the administration of justice.\" The procedure for removing a magistrate from office is set out in G.S. 7A -173. The first step occurs when a sworn written complaint is filed with the clerk of superior court. T he next step requires the chief district court judge to examine the charges in order to determine whether the allegations , \"if true, constitute grounds for removal .\" The final step in the statutory process is a public hearing conducted by a superior court judge ; upon finding that grounds for removal exist, the judge is required to remove the magistrate from office.

In general, evidence is admissible and entitled to consideration if it is relevant to an issue in the case and reliable ( that is, likely to be true). Why? /g120Small claims court is not subject to re view on appeal in the same way other trial courts are, so whether evidence does or does not become part of the record is not relevant in the same way. /g120Small claims cases never involve juries, and so the legal principles governing consideration of evidence that apply to trials before the judge without a jury are more relevant than are the rules used in jury trials. Unless evidence is objected to, or unless you, the judge, feel that the evidence is such that it might improperly bias your decision, it should be freely admitted - and given appropriate weight. When evidence is objected to, it is appropriate to rule on the objection by admitting the evidence but pointing out that its weight is to be determined. When an attorney repeatedly objects\u2014or when you anticipate that this may happen - it is proper to instruct the attorney to hold objections until the close of the evidence, at which point the attorney may be allowed to present arguments about its weight and admissibility. What you might say: \"As you know, we are about to conduct a trial before the judge without a jury, and one of the parties is not represented by an attorney, which is often the case in this court. My policy in such situations is to be lenient in allowing evidence to be offered, so that parties may testify without interruption. At the close of the evidence, I will hear any argument the parties would like to offer about evidence that you believe I should not consider. After hearing your argument, I will carefully consider all the relevant admissible evidence and determine what weight I will give it before arriving at my decision.\" Factors to consider in assessing credibility: Motive to lie Corroborating evidence Person in best position to observe Demeanor Ability to provide details Which version seems more likely? Small Claims - Page 11 Notes: A Note on Dealing With Attorneys ~ Remember that attorneys have a different role, and thus a different agenda, than you in your role as a judge. ~Don't expect that an attorney will necessarily approve of or agree with your decisions, or the way you run your courtroom. Be respectful and polite, but be prepared to be assertive if necessary in maintaining control of the courtroom. ~ Like everyone else, attorneys vary in skill and abili ty. Don't assume that an attorney is more knowledgeable than you about the law, and don't accept general proclamations about what \"the law says\" at face value. ~ Let attorneys know that you will not rule in their favor un less they explain their argument clearly, in a way that everyon e in the courtroom can unders tand. Communicate that you won't be intimidated into ruling favorably by a complicated jargon-laden legal argument made quickly and without regard for your ability to un derstand. This is an appropriate requirement, and one that an advocate should anticipate and respect. ~Never hesitate to require an attorney to establish the truth of his or her contentions by supplying a copy of a case or statute, granting a brief continuance if necessary for the attorney to obtain a copy or for you to read it carefully. Insist that copies of cases and statutes be complete, and specifically ask whether the law provided is current as of the date of trial if you have any reason to be doubtful. ~Be aware of procedural errors fr equently made by attorneys unused to small claims practice. ~Particularly when confronted with an attorney who is disruptive or insists on interrupting the testimony of the unrepresented party, be prepared to cite GS Ch . 8C, Rule 611, which provides: The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presen ting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascert ainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect wi tnesses from harassme nt or undue embarrassment. ~Similarly, when confronted with an attorney who objec ts to your questioning of parties or contends that your participation is inappropriate be cause you are \"helping,\" be prepared to cite Rule 614, which says . . . The court may, on its own motion or at the sugges tion of a party call witnesses, and all parties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called. . . . The court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or a party. Small Claims - Page 12Four Rules of Evidence You Should Know Business records exception to hearsay rule Writing or records of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge are admissible if kept in the regular course of business and if it was the regular course of business to make that record, unless the source information or circumsta nces of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness. G.S. 8-45: Verified stat ement of account In an action on an account for goods sold, rents, services rendered, or labor performed, or any oral contract for money loaded, a verified itemized statement of the account is admissible into evidence and is deemed corr ect unless disputed by the defendant. Verified : Accompanied by an affidavit from a person who (1) would be competent to testify at trial; (2) has personal knowledge of the particular account, or of the books and records of the business in general; and (3) swears that the account is correct and presently is owed by defendant to plaintiff. Itemized: Describes each item with price and item number, if there is one. Best Evidence Rule (paraphrased) When an action by a party is based on a right creat ed by a written co ntract, and the content of that contract is in dispute, the party must either produce the contract or adequately explain why he is unable to do so. Parole Evidence Rule When contract is in writing, parties may not introduce evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreement that varies the terms of the written contract Note that the rule has no application in two circumstances: (1) When the evidence is offered to assist the cou rt in determining the meaning of an ambiguous term in the contract; and (2) when the evidence offered relates to an oral agreement taking place after the written contract and thus in support of an allegation tha t the written contract was subsequently modified by a later oral agreement.

You may appeal either by telling the magistrate at the trial that you want to appeal or by filing a written request with the clerk of court within 10 days after the magistrate ruled in your case. If you want to file a written request, ask the clerk to give you a copy of form AOC-CVM-303, which is the notice of appeal form. If you give written notice of appeal to the clerk, you must also send a copy of the form to the opposing parties in your case. Whether you appeal in open court or file a written appeal, you MUST PAY $150 court costs to the clerk. These costs must be paid within 20 days of the magistrate's ruli ng, unless you are a tenant appealing from judgment in a summary ejectment action, in which case the costs must be paid within 10 days of the magistrate's ruling. If you cannot pay the appeal cost s, you may be able to qualify to file your appeal as an indigent. If you are a te nant appealing an eviction and you want to continue to live at the premises until the case is heard on appeal, you will be required to pay past due rent to the clerk and to sign an undertaking that you will pay rent into the court as it becomes due to keep the judgment from being carried out. If you meet the requirements for appeal as an indigent, you may be excused from the requirement that you pay past due rent in order to remain on the premises while the appeal is pending. If one party appeals, there will be a completely new trial before a district court judge. (In some cases, the matter may be assigned first to an arbitrator. If that occurs contact the clerk to have the procedure explained to you.) The clerk will notify both parties of the trial date (usually by mailing the trial calendar), and both must appear at that time. If you are the defendant and don't appear at trial, the plaintiff will probably win the case. Both parties should bring all y our evidence and witnesses to the trial. The trial before the district court judge will be more formal than the one before the magistrate; therefore, you may wish to consider hiring an attorney to represent you. Notice to Plaintiff (Party Suing) If you won your case, your judgment against the defendant is good for 10 years. Before the end of the 10 years, you may bring another lawsuit to extend the judgment an additional 10 years. If you have won a money judgment, it becomes a lien against any land owned by the defendant, which means the defendant cannot sell that land without paying your judgment. Just because you have a judgment does not mean that you will be able to collect it. The defendant must have enough property to enable the sheriff to sell the property to satisfy the judgment. You may tr y as many times in the 10-year period as you wish to collect the judgment. If you have won a judgment that the defendant owes y ou money, the court cannot try to help you collect that money unless you have given the defendant an opportunity to claim his or her exemptions. \"Exemptions\" is a legal term referring to a judgment debtor's right to shelte r certain property from being seized and sold to satisfy a judgment. After the judgment is rendered, you must get two forms (Notice of Rights and Motion to Claim Exempt Property) from the clerk. You must serve these on the defendant. The back of the Notice of Rights tells you how to serve the forms. If you have not heard anything from the defendant within 20 days after you have served the Noti ce of Rights and Motion, you may go to the clerk ask to have an execution issued. The back of the Notice of Ri ghts form tells you what you have to bring to the clerk. If the defendant responds to your notice and cl aims exemptions, you may either (1) agree with the exemptions claimed and ask the clerk to i ssue an execution for non-exempt property or (2) object to the Small Claims - Page 21/g3 54claimed exemptions and have the distri ct court judge determine the exempt property. After the district judge determines the defendant's exemptions, you ma y ask the clerk to issue an execution for all nonexempt property. You will have to pay $55 to have an execution issued--$25 for the court and $30 for the sheriff. Those costs will be added to the judgment to be repaid by the defendant. An execution is an order to the sheriff to seize and sell property of the defendant to satisfy the judgment. If you know of any property that belongs to the defendant, you should attach to the execution a description of the property and where it may be found to help the sheriff. The sheriff will sell any property that can be found and turn the proceeds over to the clerk of court, who will then turn the money over to you. If the defendant pays all or part of the money owed to you directly, you MUST go to the clerk's office and indicate how mu ch you have been paid. If you have a judgment ordering the defendant to turn personal property over to you and if the defendant has not turned it over within 10 days after the magistrate enters the judgment, you may ask the clerk to issue a writ of possession to the sheriff. The cost to you for having the writ issued is $25, plus $30 for the sheriff. The sheriff will then try to recover the property from the defenda nt and turn it over to you. You may be asked to advance the costs of having the sheriff pick up the property. If you are a landlord and have a judgment for eviction and the tenant fails to leave the premises within 10 days after the judgment was rendered, y ou may pay $25 and have the clerk issue a writ of possession to the sheriff. The sheriff will then remove th e defendant from the premises. You will have to pay the sheriff $30. You may be asked to advance the costs of removing the tenant's property and one month's storage costs or you may request the sheriff, in writing, to lock the premises and you will then be responsible for handling the tenant's propert y in the manner required by the law. If the defendant won a judgment against you on a counterclaim, read the section below for defendants. Notice to Defendant (Party Being Sued) If a judgment is entered against you stating that you owe the plain tiff money and you want to pay the amount owed, it would be safer to pay the money to th e clerk of court rather than to the plaintiff. If you do pay the plaintiff directly , make sure he or she notifies the clerk so the judgment won't continue to be listed against you. If you cannot or do not pay the judgment, the plaintiff will serve a notice of rights on you, telling you that you must claim your exemptions or they will be waived. It is very important that you respond to that notice. Exemptions are property the law allows you to keep from being taken from you to pay off judgments against you. If you fail to claim your exemptions, the sheriff will be able to seize and sell any property you own. If you fail to claim your exemptions when notifie d, you may ask the clerk to set aside your waiver if you have the grounds. Also, even if you have waived your st atutory exemptions, you may go to the clerk any time up until the proceeds of the sale of your property have been distributed to the plaintiff and request your constitutional exemptions. The judgment is good against you for 10 years and may be extended for another 10 years. It becomes a lien against any land you own now or buy later until it is satisfied. If you have a judgment against you to turn personal property over to th e plaintiff, you may not prevent the property from being turned over to the plainti ff unless the plaintiff is a finance company and the judgment against you is to recover household goods that you listed as co llateral in a security agreement with the finance company and the finance company did not lend you the money to buy those goods. In that case, the finance company must give you notice of y our right to claim exemptions as described in the paragraph above and you may keep the household goods from being repossessed by claiming them as exempt. If you are a tenant and have an eviction judgment against you, you will have to leave the premises. If you do not leave voluntarily, the sheriff may forcibly evict y ou and remove and store your belongings for you or may leave them with the landlord who may dispose of them in the manner allowed by the law. You will be held responsible for the costs of moving you out. Small Claims - Page 22/g3 54If you won a counterclaim against th e plaintiff in which y ou were awarded money, read the section for plaintiffs to see what to do.

Only the remedy is the same. SECURED TRANSACTIONS: LEARNING THE LINGO Friendly Furniture sells bedroom furniture, and Connie Consumer would like to purchase some. Connie doesn't have the money to pay the entire purchase price, though. So FF offers to sell her the furniture on an installment plan\u2014in other words, to \"finance\" her purchase. Of course, there's a possibility that Connie will take the furniture but not finish paying for it. If that happened, FF could certainly sue Connie for breach of contract. But there's a good chance that Connie might turn out to be \"judgment-proof,\" and even if she isn't, it would involve a lot of effort and expense on FF's part to collect. An alternative, which helps FF feel more secure, and thus more interested in selling to low-income customers, is for FF and Connie to enter into another contract saying that if \"He took my dog!\" I'm the owner or legal possessor. He wrongfully (1) took, or (2) retained my dog. \"He welshed on his debt, and we want our collateral.\" He agreed that we could repo the property if he missed a payment. He missed a payment. Recovering Personal Prop. - Page 1Connie misses a payment, FF can repossess the furniture. FF doesn't even have to come to court, unless its effort to retrieve the furniture might cause a breach of the peace. Imagine that Connie defaults, having paid $400 toward the total purchase price of $1000 for the furniture. (She's also made interest payments, but we can ignore those for the moment.) FF repossesses the furniture and sells it, for $250. FF next files an action for money owed against Connie, seeking $350. Recovering Personal Prop. - Page 2As you know, a business deal is often referred to as a transaction, and this special type of two-contracts-in-one is called a _______________________ _______________________________. To create a secured transaction, the debtor must sign a written, dated ______________________ ___________________________ that describes the property invo lved specifically enough so that it may be identified. The parties to this agreement are Connie, the debtor, and FF, the _________________ ___________________. The term for the property that secures the transaction is _____________________________________. Rather than saying that FF and Connie entered into a security agreement in which FF obtained the right to repossess the collateral if Connie doesn't pay, it's easier to simply say that FF took a _________________________ _________________________________ in the property. The legal term for Connie's failure to pay, which triggers FF's right to repossess, is _________________________________. The rules about what FF does after repossessing the property are complex. If FF sells the property, it is required to conduct the sale in a ______________________________ _______________________________ manner. Any amount still owing after the sale is called a _________________________________, and FF's lawsuit seeking that amount is an action on the deficiency .

In NC, violation of a DVPO is both a crime, punishable under crim inal law statutes, and a violation of a court order, punishable by the contempt power of the cou rt. In the majority of cases, violation of a DVPO is treated as a criminal offense, which may come before a magistrate either before or after an arrest is made. The elements of the offense are: 1) Knowingly 2) Violates 3) A valid protective order entered pursuant to a) N.C. Gen. Stat. Ch. 50B, or b) A court of another state, or c) A court of an Indian tribe. KEY POINTS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT 1. Immediate arrest is mandatory if an officer has probable cause to believe that the defendant knowingly has violated a valid protective order a) excluding the defendant from the residenc e or household occupied by a victim of domestic violence or b) directing the defendant to refrain from t hreatening, abusing, or following the plaintiff, harassing the plaintiff, including by telephone, visiting the home or workplace, or other means, or otherwise interfering with plaintiff. 2. Arrest without a warrant is discretionary fo r any other violation of G.S. 50B-4.1. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Domestic Violence - Page 293. An officer, who has probable cause, may arrest even though the defendant has left the premises by the time the officer arri ves. The officer need not actually see the violation himself or herself if the office r has probable cause to believe that the defendant violated the provisions of a domes tic violence protective order. However, the officer may not enter defendant's home without consent to arrest unless officer gets arrest warrant and may not enter the home of another person to arrest defendant without consent unless the offi cer gets an arrest warrant for the defendant and a search warrant for the premises. 4. In determining the validity of an out-of-s tate order, a law enforcement officer may rely upon a copy of the protective order i ssued by another state that is provided to the officer and on the statement of the perso n protected by the order that to the best of that person's knowledge the order is p resently in effect as written. [G.S. 50B-4(d)] The officer can also rely on any other information in determining that the defendant has violated a valid protective order. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ MAGISTRATE'S DUTY WHEN DEFENDANT IS ARRESTED FOR A VIOLATION OF G.S. 50B-4.1. If defendant is arrested by an officer without a warrant: determine whether there is probable caus e to believe person violated order. /g120If magistrate does not find probable cause, defendant is released. /g120If magistrate finds probable caus e, issues a magistrate's order. If defendant is arrested with or without a warrant , conduct initial appearance (i.e., notify defendant of rights and charges against him or her). Do not set condi tions of pretrial release for defendant. G.S. 15A-534.1 provides that only a judge may determine conditions of pretrial release. Fill in the following portions of th e Release Order (AOC-CV-200): /g120Name and address of the defendant /g120Offense /g127\"Violation of civil domestic viol ence protective order, G.S. 50B-4.1\" /g120Order of Commitment- Check block that say s \"produce him/her at the first session of district or superior court held in this cou nty after the entry of this Order or, if no session is held before ( enter date and time 48 hours after arrest) _________, produce Domestic Violence - Page 30him/her before a magistrate of this cou nty at that time to determine conditions of pretrial release.\" If defendant has been arrested on other crim es in addition to G.S . 50B-4.1, determine whether the additional charges are subject to t he special 48-hour pretrial release rules: /g120If they are, do not set bond for any of the offenses. /g120If they are not, the magistrate may set bo nd for those offenses not covered by the special pre-trial release provisions or ma y choose to not set bond for any of the offenses since he or she can not set bond for the G.S. 50B-4.1 offense. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Domestic Violence - Page 31MAGISTRATE'S DUTIES IF NO JUDGE ACTS AND A DEFENDANT IS BROUGHT BEFORE MAGISTRATE AFTER BEING HELD FOR 48 HOURS: If judge hasn't set bond with 48 hours, def endant must be brought back before magistrate on duty. Cannot wait until next morning or day.1 Magistrate determines conditions of pretrial release. Sometimes, the magistrate on duty at time for pretrial release is not the same one who held initial appearance or who issued the arrest warr ant. Therefore, magistrate who determines pretrial release may not have knowledge of the facts of case unless other the magistrate left notes. NOTE: GS 15A-534.1 (which provides that defendant may be retained in custody for reasonable period of time while determining c onditions of pretrial release if the immediate release will pose a danger of injury to the allege d victim or to any other person or is likely to result in intimidation of the alleged victim a nd if execution of an appearance bond will not reasonably insure that such injury or intimidation will not occur) usually will not be an available option because the defendant has a lready been held 48 hours. However, the statute can be used in usual situations where it is clear that immediate release will pose a danger of injury to the victim. Example: when determining conditions of pretrial release the defendant says to the magistrate \"when I get home my wife is going to regret ever calling the police.\" ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ WHAT CONSTITUTES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OF SPECIAL 48-HOUR PRETRIAL RELEASE PROVISIONS (G.S. 15A-534.1) /g120Defendant is charged with assault on a spouse or former spouse or on a person with whom the defendant lives or has liv ed as if married (opposite sex). 1 State v. Thompson , 349 N.C. 483, 508 S.E.2 d 277 (1998) (upheld constitutionality of statute but said unconstitutional as applied to defendant who was not taken before a judge at 9:30 in the morning when court opened but w as held until 2:30 that afternoon). Domestic Violence - Page 32/g120Defendant is charged with communicating a threat (G.S. 14-277.1) to a spouse or former spouse or on a person with who m the defendant lives or has lived as if married. /g120Defendant is charged with domestic criminal trespass. Domestic c riminal trespass is entering after hav ing been forbidden to enter the p remises occupied by defendant's present or former spouse or person with whom the defendant has lived as if married at a time when the complainant and def endant are living apart. Evidence of living apart includes a court order directing the defendant to stay away from the premises occupied by the complainant. [GS 14 -134.3] /g120Defendant is charged with the crime of willf ul violation of a valid domestic violence protective order under GS 50B-4.1. This o ffense applies if the relationship between the defendant and victim is a \"personal rel ationship.\" but the magistrate does not even need to inquire because that must be t he relationship for the protective order to have been issued in the first place. /g120Defendant is charged with any felon y under Art. 7A of Chapter 14 /g127rape or sexual offense /g127on a spouse or former spouse or on a person with whom the defendant lives or has lived as if married. /g120Defendant is charged with any felony under Art. 8 of Chapter 14 /g127assaults, which were already covered, castration, maiming, throwing of corrosive acid /g127on a spouse or former spouse or on a person with whom the defendant lives or has lived as if married. /g120Defendant is charged with any felon y under Art. 10 of Chapter 14 /g127kidnapping, abduction of children, felonious restraint /g127on a spouse or form er spouse or on a person with whom the defendant lives or has lived as if married. /g120Defendant is charged with any felon y under Art. 15 of Chapter 14 /g127arson and other burnings /g127on a spouse or former spouse or on a person with whom the defendant lives or has lived as if married. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Domestic Violence - Page 33ISSUES THAT ARISE IN ENFORCING VIOLATIONS Q: What if officer with proba ble cause will not arrest without a warrant for the crime of violating a domestic violence protective order by returning to the residence or by harassing, following or otherwise in terfering with the plaintiff? A: Magistrate should issue cr iminal process for crime of vi olating protective order and for any other crime that the conduct constituted. Q: Is an order issued by a district court judg e in one judicial district valid in another district? A: Yes. A domestic violence order issued b y a North Carolina judge or magistrate is effective and enforceable anywhere in North Carolina. If the plaintiff wishes to enforce a violation through a motion and sh ow cause for contempt, that motion and hearing must be filed and s et in the county where the protective order was issued. However, the defendant may be charged with the crime of violating a protective order either in the county where the viol ation occurred or in the county where the order was issued since an element of the crime took place in each county. Example : Susie is assaulted by her husband, Sam. She files a domestic violence action in Forsyth County where they live and the judge enters an order against Sam, which orders him not to assault, harass, f ollow, etc. Susie. Susie i s afraid of Sam and decides to leave. She goes to her friend's h ome in Davie County. Sam finds out she is there and goes to Davie County where he h its her again. An officer arrests Sam and takes him before a magistrate in Davie Co unty who charges him with assault and violating a protective order. Both charges wi ll be set in Davie County (the charge of violating the protective order could be tried in either Davie or Forsyth because an element of the offense occurred in both countie s, but would normally be tried in the county where the violation occurred.) If Susie had sought to enforce the order by filing a motion to show cause, she would ha ve to file that motion with the Forsyth County clerk's office. Q: Is a domestic violence order effective if the parties have reconciled or the plaintiff has invited the defendant to return to the premises? A: Yes. A domestic violence protective or der is a court order, which means that it remains effective until the date set in the or der or until a judge sets it aside, even though the parties may reconcile. [ State v. Dejarlais , 969 P.2d 90 (Wash. 1998), aff'g 944 P.2d 1110 (1997) (plaintiff's consent is n ot a defense to a charge of violating a protection order).] Domestic Violence - Page 34 Q: Is a domestic violence protective order i ssued in another state enforceable in North Carolina? A: Yes. G.S. 50B-4(d) provides that valid protective orders entered by the courts of another state or the courts of an Indian trib e shall be accorded full faith and credit by the courts of North Carolina as if they were orders issued by North Carolina courts. It does not matter whether the o rder is registered in North Carolina. It is enforced like any NC issued protective order-by charging a person who violates the out-of-state issued order in North Car olina with the crime of violating the protective order or by the victim filing a m otion for the clerk to issue a show cause order for contempt. The victim may register the order in NC by filing a copy with the clerk along with an affidavit that to the best of the victim's k nowledge the order is presently in effect as written. No notice of the registration is giv en to the defendant. If the victim does not register the order, it is still enforceable in NC. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ RELEASE/VIOLATIONS authorizes magistrates to impose the following con ditions on pretrial release for crimes of domestic violence: /g120That defendant stay away from the home, school, business or place of employment of the alleged victim. /g120That the defendant refrain from assaulting, beating, molesting, or wounding the alleged victim. /g120That the defendant refrain from removing, damaging, or injuring specifically identified property. G.S. 15A-534(a)(4) authorize s a magistrate to place restrictions on tr avel, associations, conduct or place of abode of any defendant, not just for domestic violence crimes, as conditions of pretrial release. Domestic Violence - Page 35 In 2004 the General Assembly amended G.S. 15A-401(b)(2)f. to provide that if a defendant violates a pretrial release order entered under subsection A. above (domestic violence crimes), a law enforcement officer may arrest the defendant without a warrant. If an officer has arrested a defendant for vi olating a condition of pretrial release for a domestic violence crime, the magistrate should try to get direction from the chief district court judge how to handle the matter. If there i s no direction from the judge, the magistrate should reconsider the bond and set new conditions of pretrial release. If a defendant violates a condition of pretrial rel ease for a domestic violence crime, but is not arrested by an officer, the magistrate can issue an order for arrest to bring the defendant in to modify the pretr ial release order only if the first appearance before the district court judge has not been held. If a f irst appearance has been held, the magistrate should consult the chief distr ict court judge about what pr actice the magistrate should follow. WHAT CONSTITUTES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR CRIME VICTIM'S RIGHTS LAW Crime Victim's Rights Act [G.S. 15A-830 to - 841] provides that victims of certain crimes must be given notice about the services available , time of trial and release from custody of defendant and that victims are eligible fo r crime victim's compensation funds. For the most part, victims are persons ag ainst whom violent felonies were committed, but the law also applies to the following misdem eanors when the victim and defendant have a personal relationship as defined by the G.S. 50B-1. Assault inflicting serious injury. [G.S. 14-33(c)(1)] Assault with a deadly w eapon [G.S. 14-33(c)(1)] on a female [G.S. 14-33(c)(2)] Simple [G.S. 14-33(a)] Assault by pointing a 14-34] Domestic criminal trespass [G.S. 14-134.3] Stalking [G.S. 14-277.3] The category of domestic violence victims cov ered by the Crime Victim's Rights Act is broader than the category of those covered by the special pretrial release rules. A magistrate issuing an arrest warrant in one of these covered misdemeanors must note on the process that it is a Crime V ictim's Rights Act crime and r ecord the victim's name, address, and telephone number electronically or on a form separate from the warrant and send to the clerk. The automated system has pop up questions if one of these offenses is charged and will electronically send req uired information.

I have been married to my husband for ten years. I became pregnant with my first child shortly after we were married. We now have three children, ages nine, seven and six. Even from the beginning, my husband has made all of the decisions for our family. He told me that my job was to be a good wife\u2014 to take care of the children and to cook and clean for him. The first time he hit me was when I was pregnant with my first child. We had come home from my mother's house and he was angry about something. I think I had forgotten to buy a kind of food item that he wanted, and then he slapped me. I thought it was just an isolated event. I never thought he would do it again. Since then, he has hit, kicked, choked, slapped and burned me. He does not hurt me physically that often, though, maybe only once a month. Mainly, when I do something he doesn't like, such as visiting my mother or talking on the phone to a friend, he calls me a prostitute and other bad names, and tells me that he will take the children and go to his mother's home if I am not a good wife. He refuses to let me take a job, even though all of our children are in school, and I would be qualified for many different kinds of jobs. He does not let me have any money, except for a little for grocery shopping. He is very jealous and possessive. A few months ago, he became very angry because I was late getting home from the store. He accused me of seeing another man and punched a hole in the door between the kitchen and the living room. My sons were there and saw this, and he yelled at them to go to their rooms. I recently overheard him talking to my seven-year-old son. He was asking if my son ever saw me talking to \"other men.\" He told my son that I was crazy and that my son should watch me and tell him if I did anything strange. Another time, we went to a party given by a friend of his from work. I met the wife of one of the people my husband works with. We spent a long time talking. After some time, my husband came up to me, grabbed my arm so tightly it hurt and left bruises, and whispered in my ear, \"We're leaving.\" Just by the look he gave me, I knew he was angry that I spent so much time talking with the woman, and that he would likely beat me when we got home. When we got home, he smashed a framed picture I have of myself with a group of my friends at the university, before I was married, by throwing it at the wall near where I was standing. He told me that I \"knew\" what would happen if I continued to disobey him. A few months ago, my husband came home late with friends and made me get up to cook them food. He started joking with his friends about how much I weighed, and that I was like all other women who let themselves go once they got married. He called me many bad names. After his friends left, he woke me up again and forced me to have sex with him, even though I didn't want to and was feeling sick. Recently, I tried to talk to my husband about the abuse. He got very angry. He said he doesn't hurt me any more than is to be expected of a husband and that in fact he thinks that he is too nice to me. He said that if he did happen to be a bit harsh with me sometimes, it was my fault anyway for not being a good wife and letting myself become so unattractive. I love my husband, but I do not think I can continue to live with him. He has threatened to kill me, the children, and himself if I leave him, and I don't have anywhere to go. I don't have a job or any money, and would not be able to find another place to s tay even if I did leave. Domestic Violence - Page 55 Domestic Violence - Page 56Do's and Don'ts of Handling Domestic Violence Victims DO DON'T /g120/g3Explain the services available in a simple and direct manner. /g120/g3Assume that battered women know about their options and the services available. /g120/g3Prioritize the victim's needs. /g120/g3Overload the victim with services and decisions. /g120/g3Express concern for their safety and that of their children. Empower the victim with information that increases their choices. /g120/g3Ever ask the victim why they stay. This is a shaming remark, which insinuates the victim is at fault. Leaving does not always solve the problem. /g120/g3Be aware of your own attitude, experiences and reactions to abuse. It is appropriate to disagree with the victim's behavior and/or attitude while remaining objective, empathetic and understanding. /g120/g3Impose your own values and make quick judgments. Your reaction to the victim's responses will be communicated strongly. /g120/g3Help the victim understand the danger and repetitiveness of the violence. /g120/g3Expect the victim to exaggerate or invent the violence. /g120/g3Encourage the victim to take small steps, which will promote independence and build self-confidence. /g120/g3Try to rescue the victim. /g120/g3Take into consideration cultural values and beliefs. /g120/g3Lump all victims into one category. /g120/g3Challenge any efforts on the victim's part to justify the abuse through religion. /g120/g3Reject the woman's religion or ignore references to religious beliefs. /g120/g3Convey fears for the victim's safety and respect their reasons for staying. Separation from the abuser can be the most dangerous time for the victim. /g120/g3Convey disappointment if the victim chooses to stay. This can elicit feelings of failure and worthlessness. /g120/g3Define your role as a court official; be realistic about what you can and cannot do with regards to the relationship. /g120/g3Get caught up in the role of marriage counselor, mediator and/or referee. /g120/g3Recognize that the victim's reactions and responses may change frequently and be unpredictable. Reactions will range from resistance to cooperation. /g120/g3Become cynical with the victim's failure to take the action or respond the way you believe they should. Your frustration can result in victim blaming and impact your ability to intervene effectively. /g120/g3Express your concerns if the situation is lethal and take appropriate action. /g120/g3Ignore or minimize the potential dangerousness of the situation. /g120/g3Be patient and honest with the victim. /g120/g3Expect instant decision-making by the victim or contribute to unrealistic expectations. /g120/g3Emphasize the abuser's responsibility for his/her own choices. /g120/g3Let the victim blame themselves or other factors for the abuse. /g120/g3Expect the \"honeymoon\" period to emerge following an abusive episode. /g120/g3Delay in responding to a reported incident of violence. Timing is a key factor in gathering evidentiary information. /g120/g3Challenge the victim's explanation of the incident and openly ask if their partner is hurting them. The approach must be sensitive and not threatening in nature. /g120/g3Accept unexplained injuries accompanied by implausible reasons. /g120/g3Be honest with the victim, especially about confidentiality issues. /g120/g3Make a promise you can't keep.

At the beginning of a relationship, an abuser may say that jealousy (actually possessiveness) is a sign of love. Possessiveness has nothing to do with love. It is a sign of lack of trust. The abuser may question his partner about who she talks to, accuse her of flirting, or keep her from spending time with family, friends, or children. As the possessiveness progresses, he may call her frequently during the day or drop by unexpectedly. He may refuse to let her work for fear she'll meet someone else, or even engage in behaviors such as checking her car mileage or asking friends to watch her. 2.Controlling Behavior. At first the batterer will say this behavior is due to his concern for her safety, her need to use her time well, or her need to make good decisions. He will be angry if the woman is \"late\" coming back from the store or an appointment; he will question her closely about where she went and who she talked with. As this behavior progresses, he may not let the woman make personal decisions about the house, her clothing, or even going to church. He may keep all the money or even make her ask permission to leave the house or room. 3.Quick Involvement. Many battered women dated or knew their abuser for less than six months before they were married, engaged, or living together. He comes in like a whirlwind, claiming, \"you're the only person I could ever talk to\", or \"I've never been loved like this by anyone.\" He will pressure the woman to commit to the relationship in such a way that later the woman may feel very guilty or that she's \"letting him down\" if she wants to slow down involvement or break off the relationship. 4.Unrealistic Expectations. Abusive people will expect their partner to meet all their needs. He expects a perfect wife, mother, lover, and friend. He will say things such as \"if you love me, I'm all you need, and you're all I need.\" His partner is expected to take care of everything for him emotionally and in the home. 5.Isolation. The abusive person tries to cut his partner off from all resources. If she has male friends, she's a \"whore.\" If she has women friends, she's a lesbian. If she's close to family, she's \"tied to the apron strings.\" He accuses people who are the woman's supports of causing trouble. He may want to live in the country, without a telephone, or refuse to let her drive the car, or he may try to keep her from working or going to school. 6.Blames others for problems. If he is chronically unemployed, someone is always doing him wrong or out to get him. He may make mistakes and then blame the woman for upsetting him and keeping him from concentrating on the task at hand. He may tell the woman she is at fault for virtually anything that goes wrong in his life. 7.Blames others for feelings. The abuser may tell his partner \"you make me mad,\" \"you're hurting me by not doing what I want you to do ,\" or \"I can't help being angry.\" He is the one who makes the decision about what he thinks or feels, but he will use these feelings to manipulate his partner. Harder to catch are claims, \"you make me happy,\" or \"you control how I feel.\" 8.Hypersensitivity. An abuser is easily insulted, claiming his feelings are hurt, when in actuality he is angry or taking the slightest setback as a personal attack. He will rant and rave about the injustice of things that have happened, things that are just a part of living (for example being asked to work late, getting a traffic ticket, being asked to help with chores, or being told some behavior is annoying). 9.Cruelty to animals or children. Abusers may punish animals brutally or be insensitive to their pain or suffering. An abuser may expect children to be capable of things beyond their abilities (e.g. punishes a 2 year old for wetting a diaper). He may tease children until they cry. Some studies indicate that about 60% of men who physically abuse their partners also abuse their children. 10.Sexual abuser. An abuser may physically assault private parts of a woman's body. He may show little concern about whether the woman wants to have sex and use violence to coerce her into having sex with him. He may begin having sex with his partner while she is sleeping. He may Domestic Violence - Page 63force her to do sexual acts that she finds uncomfortable, unpleasant, or degrading. He may demand sex after beating her. 11.Verbal abuse. In addition to saying things that are intentionally meant to be cruel and hurtful, verbal abuse is also apparent in the abuser's degrading of his partner, cursing her, and belittling her accomplishments. The abuser tells her she is stupid and unable to function without him. This may involve waking her up to verbally abuse her or not letting her go to sleep. 12.Rigid sex roles. The abuser expects his partner to serve him. He may even say the woman must stay at home and obey in all things - even acts th at are criminal in nature. The abuser sees women as inferior to men, responsible for menial tasks, and unable to be a whole person without a relationship. 13.Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde personality. Many women are confused by the abuser's sudden changes in mood. She may think he has some sort of mental problem because one minute he's agreeable, the next he's exploding. Explosiveness and moodiness are typical of men who beat their partners. These behaviors are related to other characteristics, such as hypersensitivity. 14.Past battering. The abuser may say he has hit women in the past, but blame them for the abuse (e.g., they made me do it\"). The women may hear from relatives or ex-partners that he is abusive. A batterer will abuse any woman he is with if the relationship lasts long enough for the violence to begin; situational circumstances do not make one's personality abusive. 15.Threats of violence. This includes any threat of physical force meant to control the partner. \"I'll slap your mouth off,\" \"I'll kill you,\" \"I'll break your neck.\" Most people do not threaten their partners. Abusers will try to excuse their threats by saying that everybody talks that way. 16.Breaking or striking objects. Breaking loved possessions is used as a punishment, but mostly to terrorize the woman into submission. The abuser may beat on the table with his fist, or throw objects around or near his partner. There is great danger when someone thinks he has the right to punish or frighten his partner. 17.Any force during an argument. This may involve the abuser's holding the woman down, physically restraining her from leaving the room, or any pushing or shoving. He may hold his partner against the wall, telling her, \"You're going to listen to me.\" Domestic Violence - Page 64Domestic Violence and Children Children Exposed to Batterers Traits of Batterers /g131Controlling /g131Entitled/Self-Centered /g131Believe they are the victims /g131Manipulative /g131Skillfully dishonest (e.g. say they \"don't remember\") /g131Disrespectful, Superior Implications of Entitlement Thinking /g131Leads abusers to think they are the victim /g131Will stop partner from attending to children so she can attend to him /g131Wants children to meet his needs /g131Increases a child's vulnerability when conditioned to meet adult's needs Implications of Good Public Image /g131Keeps people from believing partner and children /g131Abuser looks like sensitive team player /g131Confuses the children obelieve no one else thinks anything is wrong with battering oLeads children to blaming the mom, because she is only one saying something is wrong Implications of Manipulation /g131Calm demeanor in court /g131File multiple harassing or retaliatory motions /g131Make false allegations against partner, (e.g. -flight risk, substance abuser, neglects children) /g131Use court process to avoid child support or get it reduced /g131Use parallel actions in different jurisdictions to gain advantage Batterers /g131Good early in a relationship /g131Externalize responsibility /g131Punish, retaliate /g131Batter serially /g131Danger increases post separation Domestic Violence - Page 65Information from Lundy Bancroft, author of The Batterer as ParentBatterer's Risk to Abuse Children Physical Abuse /g13150% of batterers abuse their children /g1317 times more likely to abuse their children than a non-battering parent Sexual Abuse /g131Six times more likely to sexually abuse their children than a non-battering parent /g131Correlated with presence of violence towards partner but not severity Post Separation Risk /g131Abuse mothers during exchanges /g131Use child as weapon for information on mother /g131Physical, sexual, or mental abuse of child /g131Child exposed to abuser's violence of new partner /g131Learn attitudes and behaviors that lead to violence /g131Batterer is not focused on needs of child Domestic Violence - Page 66TAB: Ethics ETHICS Magistrates, like other judicial officials, may be removed from office if they are found to have engaged in willful misconduc t or in conduct \"prejudicial t o the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute.\" The p rimary source for determining what specific behavior constitutes such conduct is the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct. The Code cons ists of a Preamble and seven Canons (gen eral statements of overall principles), set out below. The complete Code contains a subst antial number of more specific provisions for each Can on; that document appears at the end of this section of the notebook. North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct Preamble An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to just ice in our society, and to this end and in furtherance thereof, this Code of Judicial Conduct is hereby established. A violation of this Code of Judicial Conduct may be deemed conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, or willful misconduct in office, or otherwise as grounds for disciplinary proceedings. . . . Canon 1 A judge should uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary. Canon 2 A judge should avoid im propriety in all his activities. Canon 3 A judge should perform the duties of his office impartially and diligently. Canon 4 Ethics-Page 1A judge may participate in cultural or historical activities or engage in activities concerning the legal, economic, educational, or governmental system, or the administration of justice. Canon 5 A judge should regulate his extrajudicial activities to ensure that they do not prevent him from carrying out his judicial duties. Canon 6 A ju dge should regularly file reports of compensation received for quasijudicial and extrajudicial activities. Canon 7 A judge may engage in political activity consistent with his status as a public official. ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ Could you boil this down to The Ten Big Rules? Ethics-Page 2THE TEN BIG RULES1 1. When it comes to behaving honorab ly, a magistrate is a magistra te 24 hours day. 2. A magistrate's judicial duties must be given priority over all other activities. 3. An ethical magistrate is patient , dignified, and courteous to a ll those with whom s/he comes into contact with in the course of performing his or her responsibilities. ________________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ 4. A magistrate must avoid ex parte communication with parties int erested in a proceeding except when such commu nication is authorized by law. 5. A magistrate should avoid partic ipating as a judicial official in a proceeding in which his or her impartiality might reasonably be questioned. 6. A magistrate should not allow his or her family, social, or personal relationships to influence his or her judic ial conduct or judgment. 7. A magistrate may engage in civic and charitable activities and other public service, including teaching, writing, and public speaking, so long as (a ) the magistrate does not raise funds for the organization; and (b) his or her activi ties do not raise doubt about the magistrate's ability t o be impartial in performing th e duties of the judicial office. 8. Neither a magistrate nor any member of the magistrate's family should accept a gift or other benefit given in connect ion with the magistrate's offi ce. 9. A magistrate should never enga ge in direct fundraising. 1 Dona's paraphrase, offered for the purpose of structuring in-class discussion. The Ten Big Rules are certainly not to be relied upon instead of, or as a definitive restatement of, the Code of Judicial Conduct, which may be found in its entirety at the end of this Tab. Ethics-Page 310. A magistrate should not endorse, or contribute to the campaign of, any particular candidate for office. ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ It might be said that a magistrate is most likely to run afoul of the Code of Judicial Conduct in three areas: (1) bias, (2) incompetence and/or lack of professionalism, and (3) abuse of power. Reading the Code from this perspective generates the following lis t of particularly important considerations for an inexperienced magistrate in approaching the duties of this new office: To avoid the appearance of bias: a. Be extremely careful about ex parte communications. b. Avoid mixing work with family, social, or other relationships c. Do not participate in any matter involving (in any way) a person within the third degree of relationship to you or your spouse. d. Don't hesitate to disqualify yourself in any matter in which your impartiality might reaso nably be questioned. e. Keep your interactions with law enforcement officers professional, being mindful of your differential roles. f. Eschew membership in organizations that practice unlawful discrimination g. Be unswayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism. Ot Or maybe the 3 big no-no's? Ethics-Page 4h. Be very careful about public comment on matters likely to come before you. To avoid the appearance of incompetence/lack of professionalism: a. Be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it. b. Maintain order and decorum in proceedings before you. c. Address parties by their appropriate title and last name and require them to address you in the same way. To avoid the appearance of abuse of power : a. Do not lend the prestige of your office to advance the private interest of others. b. Treat everyone who appears before you with patience, dignity, and courtesy. c. Do not engage in fundraising activity. d. Do not endorse anyone for public office (although you may attend political gatherings, be active in a political part y, and make contributions to the party). e. Do not accept a gift from a party, and avoid accepting gifts from parties who appear frequently before you or who are otherwise in a position likely to benefit or suffer from your decisions as a judicial Ethics A magistrate is married to a police officer. Can the magistrate handle cases in which the officer appears before him or her? You arrive early to small claims court, as does a merchant bringing se veral collection suits. One of the defendants comes into the courtroom and sees the two of you chatting. Does your behavior raise ethical concerns? Your church asks you to serve as the head of its finance committee. Your duties would include raising money for next year's budget. Can you serve? The incumbent sheriff is running for re-election and asks you to endorse him. Can you?

Practical Tips for New Judges Making the Transition to the Bench By Judge Douglas S. Lavine Hon. Douglas S. Lavine was appointed to the trial bench by Connecticut Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in 1993 and to the Connecticut A ppellate Court in 2006 by Governor M. Jodi Rell. The views expressed in this article are strictly his own. He can be reached at Dou glas.Lavine@co nnapp.jud.ct.gov. Congratulations! You have been appointed to the bench. I can assure you that you will find your new job to be enormously gratifying and challenging. You will have a rare opportunity to use your legal and personal skills, honed by the pra ctice of law, to serve the community. I can honestly say that I have enjoyed going to work on all but a few days of the nearly sixteen years I have been on the bench. Almost all of my judge friends feel the same way. With your new position comes a signifi cant passage. You are beginning something exciting, but you are also ending an impo r- tant phase of your life. You will be moving out of your previous comfort zone, one in which you may have had a high degree of control over your daily life and signif icant c onfidence in your abilities. In your new milieu, it is likely that almost everyone you deal with\u2014other judges, lawyers, court staff \u2014will in itially understand the way the system operates better than you. It will take time to adapt to your new surroundings i n what one writer has called the \"neutral zone \"\u2014a time of reorientation to new circumstances and surroundings.1 Be patient with yourself. In a relatively short period of time, you will emerge, like the proverbial butterfly from the cocoon, relaxed and conf ident, ready to fly. Everyone will call you \"Your Honor, \" doors will be held open, and lawyers will laugh at your jokes \u2014even when they are not funny. Especially when they are not funny. You will carry an elevated status in your community, particularly in t he legal world you inhabit. People will view you di fferently, and you will view yourself differently. You will be held to higher, more exacting standards. Everyone will stand when you enter the cour troom. I have a colleague who recalled the first time she headed out onto the bench. Everyone stood. She reflexively turned around, asking herself, \"Whom are they standing for? \" From now on, they will be standing for you. This is heady stuff and can result in a severe attack of early onset robitis, a dreaded dise ase sometimes afflicting new judges which I will discuss later. It takes some time to adjust. Presumably, mentors, colleagues, and others you trust will offer advice. Like everyone who came before you, you will need to find your own way. No matter the adv ice you receive from other judges, every decision you make will be your own. It will become part of your judicial DNA. I wish you the best in ruling on the myriad issues you will confront over the years, issues often critical in the lives of the people who come before you and in the communities in which you live. I do not claim to have any sage advice when it comes to the art of judging. But in more than fifteen years on the bench \u2014 thirteen as a trial judge, and almost three on the Connecticut Appellate Cou rt\u2014I have learned a few things about how to deal with recurring issues, some on the bench and many off, that you are sure to encounter. I claim to speak for no one but myself and underscore that the points raised here are based on my own experiences and ob servations, and sometimes, mistakes. As a judicial colleague, I hope these nuts -and-bolts suggestions will help you successfully cope with some of the mundane issues that you will face in your new role. Dealing with Friends Some people will take your new status in stride. But others, including people you have known your whole life, may act di f- ferently. Some acquaintances might be a bit standoffish or appear to be slightly intimidated. Others will tease you about ha v- ing all the answers. Dealing with lawyer friends and colleagues \u2014people you used to practice with or against \u2014will present special challenges, especially when faced with issues of recusal or disqualification. It is important to be familiar with profe s- sional requirements relating to these issues. I recommend speaking to experienced judges with a good sense of local pra c- tices and mores before making recusal or disqualification decisions. Of course, judges have a duty not to remove themselves from a case merely because a motion has been made. But expe rience teaches that even if litigants lose their cases, they can accept their disappointment if they think they have had a fair hearing. Appearances matter. Obviously every case is di f- ferent, but be very careful about remaining in a case if your fairness o r objectivity can be reasonably questioned. You must be the guardian of your own reputation for fairness and impartiality. The Line Between Public and Private Behavior In a nutshell, it is best, under most circumstances, to act as if this line no longer e xists. What I mean is this: whatever you say and do, an ywhere and to anyone, can be grist for the mill if it reflects upon your fitness to dispense justice. I suggest the following approach: except, pe rhaps, when dealing with immediate family and friends, imagine that what you say or do will appear in your local newspaper. Much as you may try, you really cannot be a judge just during the hours you are at court, or in your chambers. You are a judge all the time. Let me give a few h ypotheticals. (1) Every yea r, prior to your appointment, you have hosted a big party at which alcohol is served. In the past, if someone was stopped on the way home for a DUI, it might have been a cause for concern. Now, it could mushroom into a major career blemish. (2) In the past , you sat and smiled uncomfortably when someone told an inappropriate joke. Now, doing or saying nothing might be understood by ot h- Ethics-Page 7Published in The Judges' Journal, Volume 48, Number 1, Winter 2009. \u00a9 2009 by the American Bar Association.

This information or any portion thereof may not be copied or disseminated in any form or by any means or stored in an electronic database or retrieval system without the express written consent of the American Bar Association. ers to be an endorsement of the offensive attitudes expressed by the teller of the joke. (3) In the past, when someone was tailgating at high speeds you might have been tempted to slow down, or yell at them, or gesticulate. Now, taking any of these actions could lead to an allegation that you exhibited \"road rage \" and lack appropriate judicial temperament. (4) In the past, you m ight talk freely in an elevator no matter who was in it. Now, any words you utter could have an impact on a case or a juror or could be repeated in another courtroom. The simple truth is this: the line between private and public behavior has become blurre d beyond recognition now that you are a judge. As a judge, you are a public figure. Your private conduct, therefore, is of interest to the public \u2014and the press. Therefore, you must conduct yourself with the utmost care in private matters as well as public. Requests for Legal Advice Here is the usual scenario. You are at a party when the friend of a friend approaches you, introduces himself, and states he knows you are a judge. He makes small talk. He says that he knows you are not allowed to give legal adv ice. Actually, he tells you, he is not seeking legal a dvice, but he has just one question, and maybe you can assist. It seems that his brother -in- law has been kicked out of the house by his spouse and he wants to go in to get his clothes and other personal belongings. Any problem? Or \"a friend 's son \" got caught in the school bathroom smo king marijuana and was manhandled by the school 's personnel. Can 't they sue the school? Or his elderly mother got this speeding ticket and . . . . You get the idea. As a law yer, you have undoubtedly dealt with such questions throughout the years. But as a judge, it becomes more important still that you absolutely, positively say or do nothing that could be construed \u2014or misconstrued \u2014as giving legal advice. First of all, judges are prohibited from giving such advice. Secondly, it is not uncommon for laypeople to misunderstand or misinterpret legal concepts \u2014or to hear what they want to hear. So even if you decide to be polite and give some seemingly innocuous counsel with a discl aimer, the disclaimer is likely to be ignored. The last thing you want to learn is that Joe Smith 's friend went into criminal court and told the judge that he went into the house to retrieve his belongings because \"Judge Jones told me I could. \" My advice? Tell the simple truth. Explain that you would like to be of assistance but that you are strictly prohi b- ited, for professional reasons, from giving legal advice. And never, ever succumb to the temptation to do so. Mentioning that You Are a Judge Years ag o, I worked as an assistant U.S. attorney. Often, I would be sitting next to someone on an airplane and the co n- versation would be r elaxed and friendly until I mentioned that I was a prosecutor. Then everything stopped. I always a s- sumed that people thought that I would init iate a tax investigation if they said the wrong thing. In your new role, people will react differently to you when they learn you are a judge. Some people will want to treat you more favorably because of your position. My advice is to resi st, except in social situations where the subject arises naturally, the temptation to tell people that you are a judge unless you are asked. What that means is this. (1) If you are on a waiting list at a local restaurant, do not mention that you are a judg e in the hope of getting seated before your time, and don 't permit your spouse, significant other, or partner to do so either. (2) If you are pulled over for speeding, do not disclose that you are a judge in the hope of gaining favored trea tment. And do no t put your judicial credentials next to your driver 's license so the officer will inevitably discover that you are a judge. (3) If your spouse has a dispute with the local mechanic because he charged more than he said he would, do not make that angry phone call claiming that, as a judge, you know what he is doing is unlawful, a violation of co n- sumer protection laws, that you decided a case just like this, etc. (4) If your child is arrested for possession of marijuana, do not try to use your status to obtain preferential treatment for him or her. And so on. The bottom line is that the inappropriate use of your position to obtain special treatment is an abuse of power. Charities Some people will try to use your pres ence at an event or your name on a letterhead to raise funds. No matter how worthy the charity or cause, this should be resisted. Check relevant ethical rules, guidelines, and decisions to determine to what e x- tent you can be involved in charitable events, including those with which you have had a long -time involvement. Political Activities Different considerations may apply, of course, in states in which judges are elected. But for appointed judges in places like Connecticut, the rule is simple. Political activity is strictly verboten. Avoid rallies, fund -raisers, making contributions, bumper stickers, and signs or posters on your lawn. If your spouse is involved in politics, steer clear of situations in which it appears that you yourself are engaging in po litical conduct. Email It is probable that at home you have received unsolicited email that is offensive to you. Be careful not to allow any such unsolicited material to be forwarded to your work computer. When writing email messages at work, avoid langu age that would embarrass you if printed in the local newspaper. Tell friends and colleagues not to send you jokes, articles, and pi c- tures at work. When online at work, avoid sites or searches that could call up offensive material. Use your home computer to communicate with friends to avoid contamination of your work computer.

Work Interactions All of your contacts with everyone in the work setting should be polite, professional, and courteous. You are a role model and should set the appropriate tone. This includes lawyers, secretaries, marshals, probation officers, the cleaning crew, fa m- ily relations officers, stenographers, court reporters, members of the public, foreign visitors, school children on a class trip \u2014 virtually everyone. Court systems are huge echo cha mbers. Everything you say and do is grist for the mill. Rumors and a n- ecdotes fly from court to court. If you are rude or inconsiderate, that will be known to everyone quickly. Jokes or comments that might have been appropriate in your past life, wh en talking to longtime associates or e mployees, are better left unsaid in your new role. Discussing Cases or Opinions in Public The scenario is a familiar one. You are out to lunch with judge friends and the discussion turns to a trial you are presiding over. You offer a few tart opinions on the performance of a lawyer or the merits of the case. Oops! You didn 't notice, but in the next booth is the very lawyer you have been discussing, or the plaintiff, or a juror. The prospect of a mistrial in your first trial now dangles before you. Be very, very discreet when discussing legal matters, particularly a case, with a colleague. Talking about cases or decisions in a public setting \u2014a restaurant, a hallway, an elevator \u2014frequently invites disaster. Sim i- larly, do not leave files, drafts of opinions, or anything else relating to a case lying around \u2014in a car, at a restaurant, or an y- where. Ruling Before You Are Ready Your job is now to analyze arguments and make decisions. In a variety of settings, the problems req uiring a decision will come at you very quickly. Nonetheless, my advice is to never rule unless you are comfortable with what you are doing. It is often said that lawyers prefer a timely decision, any decision, even if it is at odds with their positions, t o being forced to wait. And there will be times when numerous factors \u2014a heavy docket, a crowded court, the presence of people who have come from a long distance to attend a proceeding \u2014will militate toward just ruling and moving on. I am not counseling timidity or indecision. But if that little internal voice that sometime speaks to you tells you that you are not ready to rule, listen to it. Take a recess. Hear more argument and think it over. Seek out advice from a senior colleague. Order ad ditional briefs. Or just sleep on it. Very few decisions are so urgent that they cannot wait a few more hours or days. Expressions of Personal Opinions on the Bench During my first judicial assignment, a crusty veteran gave me two bits of advice. First, h e said, always stop in the bat h- room before going out onto the bench. Second, KYBMS \u2014Keep Your Big Mouth Shut. I leave to you whether you choose to follow his first bit of advice. But over the years I have come to appreciate his blunt advice about keeping pe rsonal comments and observations to an absolute minimum. Plea santries are okay. Occasional conversation can be alright. But always r e- member that we are not being paid to express our personal or political views on the matters of the day or share our thought s on the pennant race, the state of the economy, or anything else. Nor are we a sort of master of ceremonies in a robe, presi d- ing over an entertainment event. Except for court personnel, lawyers and the like, the people in the courtroom almost always do no t want to be there. They are a captive audience. It is, frankly, somewhat egocentric to think otherwise and an abuse of your authority to force people to listen to opinions they would just as soon not hear. Humor on the Bench or in Written Opinions Off th e bench, a lively and irreverent sense of humor can be charming. I used to think I was funny until my now -twenty - two-year-old daug hter somewhere back in the eighth grade or so stopped laughing at my jokes and just sighed. But on the bench, or in written op inions, joke -telling runs the risk of detracting from the solemnity of the proceedings, being boorish, and veering off into abusiveness. A joke \u2014particularly at someone 's expense \u2014may earn you snickers from some observers, but what seems funny to you will be deeply offensive to someone else. Criminal defendants, litigants in a divorce, plaintiffs in a malpractice case, and others forced into court, see nothing at all humorous about their situation. Never forget that for most people, a court case represents a traumatic event and frequently involves matters of the utmost importance in their lives. Even when you are acting with the best of intentions or trying to lessen the tension in the courtroom, attempts at humor are almost always likely to be misunderstood. My advice? Avoid the laugh lines; think it, but don 't say it. The same applies to written opinions. Jokes, or opinions in verse, may seem clever when written, but they are not likely to seem funny to the pe o- ple on the receiving end whose cases you are dec iding. Treating Everyone with Courtesy and Respect You should strive to treat everyone \u2014underline everyone \u2014with patience, courtesy, and respect.

Your job is to set the appropriate tone of dignity and fairness in the courtroom and to apply the rul es fairly to ever y- one. Dealing with the Media How do you deal with the media? With extreme care. This is particularly the case if you receive a call asking you to co m- ment on a pending matter. In most, if not all, jurisdictions, judges are prohibited from commenting on a pending case. In many jurisdictions, the judicial branch will have designated a person to handle calls and manage press relations. If you are uncomfortable returning reporters ' calls, you can delegate that job to someone else. However, as a former reporter who co v- ered legal matters, I can attest to the fact that often reporters are working under tight deadlines. Therefore, even if you ca n- not or do not wish to comment, the courteous thing to do is to return the call personally or to direct s omeone else to do it so that the reporter is informed that you cannot, or will not, comment. Robitis We turn now to the dreaded disease, robitis. Robitis is defined as a condition that befalls a judge when he or she dons a robe which causes the judge to assume a self -important, arrogant attitude. In your years in practice, you have undoubtedly practiced b efore judges with this dreaded affliction. Robitis can be fatal to a judge 's career. Friends and colleagues will probably be reticent to tell you if you have come down with it. Figure out a way to have someone \u2014perhaps a mentor or more experienced colleague who you respect \u2014close the door and tell you if you are showing symptoms of the disease. Co m- ments from lawyers and jurors, if you have access to them, can be helpful. If you see a recurring theme emerging in these comments, resist the human urge to resent them and ignore them. Also try to step outside of yourself \u2014mentally \u2014on occ a- sion, look dispassionately down at your own behavior, and ask yourself if you like what you see. Your work is important; take it seriously. Try not to take yourself too seriously. A touch of humility goes a long way. So does a willingness to acknowledge that you have made a mi stake or misunderstood an argument or would like to be educated on a point of law. Ethical Concerns You must be the guardian of your own integrity and reputat ion. Friends and family may ask you to do things not unde r- standing that a di fferent set of rules applies to you. My wife still makes fun of me when we are walking our dogs because I refuse to walk over a small patch of waterfront property near our home tha t has a \"No Trespassing \" sign posted. Explain to your family in emphatic terms that you are now living under a set of rules that is different from other people 's and that you need to be scrupulous in ways that others may find excessive. Periodically revie w the Code of Judicial Conduct. When in doubt about the propriety of conduct, check with a senior colleague or a designated person in your judicial branch. Keep your ethical antennae up. Never do anything if you have qualms about its propriety. A Final Comment Again, congratulations to you. I guarantee that you will love being a judge. It is an honor and a privilege to be appointed or elected a judge. It is also a great responsibility. I wish you the best. I hope these suggestions are helpful to you as b egin this exciting passage. Endnote 1. WILLIAM BRIDGES , TRANSITIONS : MAKING SENSE OF LIFE'S CHANGES (1980). Ethics-Page 101 JUDICIAL ETHICS AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES Michael Crowell UNC School of Government August 2012 (Updated) One of the significant developments in communication in recent years is the astounding growth of social networking websites. Huge numbers of people have join ed Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter or other on-line social networks as a means to notify others of news in their lives, to learn what their friends and relatives and acquaintances are doing, and to generally stay in touc h with other people with whom they have something in common . Businesses, organizations and government agencies use social networks to communicate information about their products and services and get limited feedback. For individuals, and for some kinds of organizations, the appeal of such sites is the opportunity for ongoing back-and-forth communication among large groups of people . Typically a social network allows someone to post a profile and photographs, videos, music, etc., and in vite others to become \"friends\" or \"fans.\" Some information may be shared with the whole world; other parts may be restricted to a select, small group. As with the general population, the number of judge s using social media sites continues to increase. A 2012 report says that 46.1 percent of judges surveyed use a social media profile site. Among those judges, Facebook is most popular, being the choice of 86.3 percent of the users. For some time now state bar regulatory agencies have been addressing the effect of electronic communication on traditional ethical rules for lawyers the extent to which law firm websites constitute advertising, whether e-mail inquiries establish an attorney/client relationship, and so on. Likewise, judges hearing cases have faced new legal issues involving electronic discovery and searches of computers . Judges are becoming familiar, too, with problems of jurors communicating with the outside world and conducting their own research via their smart phones and other devices. Until recently, though, there has been relatively little reference material for judges concerning their own social networking and the Code of Judicial Conduct. The purpose of this paper is to share some information addressing questions of judges' personal use o f social networks. I welcome any additional material anyone knows about. Ethics-Page 112 Judges' use of social networks A good overview of social networking issues for judges appears in an April 30, 2010, on-line article from Slate entitled \" Tweet Justice .\" The article reports that some judges search Facebook and other sites to check on what lawyers and parties are up to, and it tells of one judge who requires all juveniles appearing before her to friend her on Facebook or MySpace so she can monitor their activities. As the article says, the new social media can generate ethical issues for judges. One question is the appearance created by a judge and lawyer \"friending\" each other on a social network. Another potential pitfall is the increased opportunity for ex parte communication. The article cites a North Carolina judicial discipline case arising from a Facebook friendship. North Carolina disciplinary case The North Carolina disciplinary case mentioned in the Slate article is an April 2009 reprimand issued by the Judicial Standards Commission . The judge and lawyer had decided at the beginning of a child custody/support proceeding to friend each other on Facebook and then exchanged comments about the case on the social network. That contact led to the reprimand for ex parte communication. The judge was also reprimanded for his independent research on the parties, without informing either side, through his visits to the wife's business website, a photography business where she posted both photographs and poems. Articles about judges and social networks For another example of how a judge's use of Facebook can lead to trouble, there is the resignation of Georgia judge Ernest Wood as reported in both the ABA Journal . Another example, also reported in a local newspaper , involves a lawyer who served as a substitute judge in North Las Vegas. He was removed from the office once the district attorney discovered that the judge's MySpace page said one of his personal interests was \"Breaking my foot off in a prosecutor's ass.\" There a re also two articles on social networking in American Judicature Society publications, but they are not on-line. One is \"Judges and Social Networks\" in the Judicial Conduct R eporter, Vol. 32, No. 1, p. 1. The other is \"The Too Friendly Judge? Social Netwo rks and th e Bench,\" by Cynthia Gray in Judicature magazine, Vol. 93, p. 236 (May-June 2010). Ethics opinions The question of whether judges may join social networks and whether they may be social networking friends with lawyers, law enforcement officers and others now has been addressed Ethics-Page 123 by eight state ethics committees. All the opinions say that judges may join social networks, but they disagree on the propriety of friending lawyers. Florida, Oklahoma and Massachusetts say no; New York, Kentucky, South Carolina, Ohio and California say yes, though usually with qualifications. All the opinions warn judges about the potential pitfalls of social networks for embarrassment and damage to the dignity and integrity of the office. The short reviews of the ethics opinions below explain the issues that may arise under the Code of Judicial Conduct. Florida The Florida Supreme Court's Judicial Ethics Advisory Co mmittee's opinion 2009 -20, issued on November 17, 2009, received a great deal of publicity because it was one of the earliest opinions and because it concluded that judges may not add lawyers as friends on a social network. The opinions from several other jurisdictions have taken a different view, as discussed below. The Florida committee opined that a judge could join a social network and post comments and other materials so long as the material did not otherwise violate the Code of Judicial Conduct, but that the judge could not add as friends lawyers who appear before the judge, nor allow lawyers to add the judge as a friend. The committee further said that a judge's election campaign committee could post material on a social network and could allow lawyers and others to list th emselves as \"fans ,\" provided the judge or campaign committee did not control who could list themselves in that manner. The committee's concern was that the judge's acceptance of a lawyer as a friend on the judge's page on the s ocial network would violate the canon which prohibits a judge from conveying the impression, or allowing others to convey the impression, that a person is in a special position to influence the judge. The comparable provision in North Carolina's Code of J udicial Conduct is in Canon 2B. The Florida's committee noted that being listed as a friend as the term is used on social network would not necessarily mean that the lawyer actually was in a special position, but the listing would convey that impression. The original Florida opinion generated additional inquiries resulting in three follow-up opinions. The first is Opinion Number 2010- 04 which advises that judicial assistants may add as Facebook friends lawyers who may appear before the judge for whom the assistant works, so long as the assistant's Facebook activity is conducted independently of the judge and does not mention the judge or court. The next Florida opinion, Number 2010- 05, advised that candidates for judicial office are not subject to the original opinion and that they, thus, may add as Facebook friends lawyers who are likely to appear before them if elected. The opinion is based on the wording of the Florida Code of Judicial Conduct which specifies the portions that apply to candidates. Ethics-Page 134 Finally, the Florida Judicial Ethics Advisory Committee revisited and reiterated its support for its original opinion on March 26, 2010, with Opinion Number 2010- 06. The new opinion was prompted by several inquiries, two of whi ch proposed disclaimers on judges' Facebook pages and one of which asked about an organization's Facebook page. The committee advised, first, that a judge who is a member of a voluntary bar association which uses a Facebook page may use that page to communicate with other members, including lawyers, about the organization and about non- legal matters, and does not have to \"de -friend\" lawyer members who might appear before the judge. The opinion emphasized that the organization, not the judge, controlled the Facebook page and decided which friend requests would be accepted and rejected. One judge asked whether the concerns expressed in the original opinion could be addressed by including a disclaimer on the judge's Facebook page s tating that (a) the judge would accept as a friend anyone the judge recognized or who shared a number of common friends; (b) the term \"friend\" does not mea n a close relationship; and (c) no one listed as a friend is in a position to influence the judge. Another judge inquired about a similar approach, proposing to state on the judge's Facebook page that the judge would accept as a friend all lawyers who requested to be added. The Florida committee rejected both proposals and stuck to its original opinion. The committee majority said that the disclaimer failed to cure the impression that a lawyer listed as a Facebook friend had special influence. The majority observed that lawyers who chose not to use Facebook would not be listed as friends and that there was no assurance that someone viewing the page would see or read the disclaimer. A minority of the committee wrote a dissent, calling for withdrawal of the original opinion, arguing that judges are not prohibited from having lawyers as friends in the historic sense of the word and that adding a lawyer as a Facebook- defined friend creates no stronger impression of special influence than does ordinary socializing. The minority would advise that a judge may accept lawyers as Facebook friends and that any motion to require the judge to recuse because of that relationship would need to include additional specific allegations supporting the impression of special influence. South Carolina In October 2009 the South Carolina Advisory Committee on Standards of Judicial Conduct issued Opinion 17-2009 . With little discussion the committee said that a magistrate may join Facebook and be friends with law enforcement officers and court employees so long as the site is not used for discussion of judicial business. Ethics-Page 145 New York More extended discussions, tending toward the same result as South Carolina but with more helpful analysis and discussion, have come from New York, Kentucky, Ohio and California . The gist of Opinion 08-176 of the New York Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, issued on January 29, 2009, is that there is nothing fundamentally different about a judge socializing through a social network and socializing in person, and nothing fundamentally different about communicating electronically rather than face to face. The key question for the committee was not whether a judge could join a social network but how the judge behaves on the network. The judge, said the committee, needs to be aware of the public nature of comments posted on such a site; the potential of creating the appearance that a lawyer who friends the judge will have special influence; and the likelihood that people might use th e judge's social network page to seek legal advice. The committee observed that in some ways allowing a person to become a friend on a social network is no different than adding the person's contac t information to a Rolodex, but still cautioned that when combined with other circumstances the friending can lead to the appearance of a close social relationship requiring disclosure or recusal. Kentucky One of the most extensive opinions is Formal Judicial Ethics Opinion JE- 119 issued on January 10, 2010, by the Ethics Committee of the Kentucky Judiciary. The Kentucky committee does not believe that being designated a friend on a social netwo rk by itself conveys an impression of a special relationship. The committee repeats the cautions of the New York opinion, though, and notes that \"social networking sites are fraught with peril for judges . . . .\" Personal information, photographs and comments that might be appropriate for someone else may not satisfy th e higher standards for judges. The committee also warns of the problem of ex parte communications and cites the North Carolina reprimand. California Opinion 66 from the Judicial Ethics Committee of the California Judges Association, issued on November 23, 2010, is well written and useful. The California committee concludes, with qualifications, that a judge may join a social network, even one which includes lawyers who may appear before the judge, but the judge must disclose the social network connection and must defriend the lawyer when the lawyer has a case before the judg e. As to whether a judge may friend a lawyer, the committee answers that it depends on the nat ure of the social network and whether the lawyer has a case before the judge. If the social network is one limited to the judge's relatives and a few close colle agues and it is used for exchanging personal information, for example, the likelihood will be greater that the lawyer appears to have special influence . There is much less risk, by comparison, when the social Ethics-Page 156 network involves individuals and organizations interested in a particular subject or project, say a sports team or a charitable project, and the exchanges are limited to that topic. Regardless of the nature of the social network, however, the California opinion says the judge should always disclose tha t the judge has a social network tie to a lawyer and must recuse from any case in which a friend from the first kind of network, the more personal one, is participating. Even for the second kind of social network, the less personal one, the judge should de-friend the lawyer when the lawyer appears in a case before the judge. One issue the California opinion addresses but other s do not is the judge's obligation when others post comments on the judge's personal social network page. The committee says that the ethical obligation to avoid the appearance of bias requires the judge to monitor the judge's page frequently for such comments and to delete the comments, hide them from public view or otherwise repudiate anything others say that is offensive or demeaning. Leaving comments on the page can create the impression that the judge has adopted the comments. The California opinion also admonishes judges to not create links to political organizations or others that would amount to impermissible political activity . And the judge must be careful not to lend the prestige of the office to another by posting any material that would be construed as advancing that other person's interest. Finally, the opinion admonishes judges to be familiar with a social network's priv acy settings and how to modify them. And the judge should be aware that other participants in the social network may not guard privacy as diligently and may thereby expose the judge's comments, photographs, etc., to others without the judge's permission. Ohio The Ohio opinion is Opinion 2010- 7, issued December 3, 2010, by the Ohio Supreme Court's Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. It is the last opinion in the list of 2010 opinions . The Ohio opinion observes that there is no prohibition on a judge being a friend of a lawyer who appears before the judge, thus friending on-line cannot be an ethics violation by itself . The opinion notes the special risks associated with social networks for judges and advises that: (a) the judge must be careful to maintain the dignity of the office in every comment, photograph, etc., posted on the site; (b) a judge should not interact on social networks with individuals or organizations whose advocacy or interest in matters before the court would raise questions about the judge's independence ; (c) the judge should not make any comments on a site about any matter pending before the judge; (d) the judge should not use the social network for ex parte communications; and (e) the judge should not undertake independent investigation of a case by visiting a party's or witness' page. Finally, the Ohio opinion advises judges to consider Ethics-Page 167 whether interaction with a lawyer on a social network creates any bias or prejudice concerning the lawyer or a party. Oklahoma The Oklahoma Judicial Ethics Advisory Board issued its Judicial Ethics Opinion 2011-3 on July 6, 2011. Oklahoma supports the Florida point of view, that while a judge may participate in social networking sites the judge should not be social network friends with lawyers, law enforcement officers, social workers or others who ma y appear in the judge's court. In the panel's view such a relationship can convey the impression that the person is in a special position to influence the judge. It is immaterial whether the person actually is in such a position, it is the possible impression that matters, and in the opinion of the Oklahoma committee, \"We believe that public trust in the impartiality and fairness of the judicial system is so important that [it] is imperative to err on the side of caution where the situation is 'fraught with peril.'\" Massachusetts The last opinion issued is CJE Opinion No. 2011-6 from the Committee on Judicial Ethics of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Massachusetts relies on the Florida analysis in concluding that a judge may join a social network site but may not friend any lawyer who appears before the judge. \"Stated another way, in terms of a bright -line test, judges may only 'friend' attorneys as to whom they would recuse themselves when those attorneys appeared before them.\" Friending creates the impression, Massachusetts concl udes, that the lawyer is a special position to influence the judge. The Massachusetts opinion repeats briefly the warnings from other opinions about the posting of embarrassing photographs, the avoidance of ex parte communications, and the like, and also adds a new caution. It tells judges not to identify themselves as judges on the social network site, nor allow others to do so. Such identification would run afoul of the code provisions against using the prestige of the office to advance private interests, in addition to the problem of creating an impression that others are in a special position to influence the judge. Summary Although the number of opinions about judges and social networks is still small, there does seem to be a consensus building on several issues. There appears to be general agreement among the ethics committee that: (1) Judges may join on-line social network s. (2) Social networks create opportunities and temptations for ex parte communication that judges must be careful to avoid. Ethics-Page 178 (3) Judges are still judges when posting materials on their social networking pages and need to realize that the kinds of comments and photographs posted by others may not be appropriate for them. (4) Judges need to avoid on-line ties to organizations that discriminate, just as they are prohibited from joining such organizations. (5) Judges also need to avoid on-line ties to organizations that may be advocates before the court. (6) Judges need to avoid posting comments on social network sites or taking other actions on such sit es that lend the prestige of the judge's office to the advancement of a private interest. The ethics committees divide most sharply on the issue of a judge accepting a lawyer as a friend on a social network. The majority of the states opining on the issue to date conclude that friending does not by itself establish such a relationship as to imply that the lawyer has special influence and does not by itself require the judge to recuse from cases with that lawyer, although they recognize that a social network friendship may create such problems when combined with other circumstances. In the view of those states, being a friend of a judge on a social network is no different than being a friend in person and does not by itself lead to automatic recusal. On the other hand, the ethics committees of three states have concluded that a social network friendship is sufficiently likely to create the impression of special influence that it should be barred. Although such an impression of favoritism may be mistaken, the approach of those ethics committee is to err on the side of caution when it comes to appearances of fairness. Judges also should be aware of the security issues that come with social networking. A judge's page on Facebook or MySpace or other social netwo rk can provide lots of information to someone who is dissatisfied with the judge's decisions and wants to do harm. 8/10 /12 This paper may be used for educational purposes without permission.

Ethics-Page 18North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct Adopted April 2003 The North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct is hereby amended to read as follows: Preamble An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society, and to this end and in furtherance thereof, this Code of Judicial Conduct is hereby established. A violation of this Code of Judicial Conduct may be deemed conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, or willful misconduct in office, or otherwise as grounds for disciplinary proceedings pursuant to Article 30 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of North Carolina. No other code or proposed code of judicial conduct shall be relied upon in the interpretation and application of this Code of Judicial Conduct.

A judge should not hold membership in any organization that practices unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion or national origin. Canon 3 A judge should perform the duties of his office impartially and diligently. The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all his other activities. His judicial duties include all the duties of his office prescribed by law. In the performance of these duties, the following standards apply. A. Adjudicative responsibilities. Ethics-Page 19(1) A judge should be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it. He should be unswayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism. (2) A judge should maintain order and decor um in proceedings before him. (3) A judge should be patient, dignified and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers and others with whom he deals in his official capacity, and should require similar conduct of lawyers, and of his staff, court officials and others subject to his direction and control. (4) A judge should accord to every person who is legally interested in a proceeding, or his lawyer, full right to be heard according to law, and, except as authorized by law, neither knowingly initiate nor knowingly consider ex parte or other communications concerning a pending proceeding. A judge, however, may obtain the advice of a disinterested expert on the law applicable to a proceeding before him. (5) A judge should dispose promptly of the business of the court. (6) A judge should abstain from public comment about the merits of a pending proceeding in any state or federal court dealing with a case or controversy arising in North Carolina or addressing North Carolina law and should encourage similar abstention on the part of court personnel subject to his direction and control. This subsection does not prohibit a judge from making public statements in the course of official duties; from explaining for public information the proceedings of the Court; from addressing or discussing previously issued judicial decisions when serving as faculty or otherwise participating in educational courses or programs; or from addressing educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, political, or civic organizations. (7) A judge should exercise discretion with regard to permitting broadcasting, televising, recording, or taking photographs in the courtroom and areas immediately adjacent thereto during civil or criminal sessions of court or recesses between sessions, pu rsuant to the provisions of Rule 15 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts. B. Administrative responsibilities. (1) A judge should diligently discharge his administrative responsibilities, maintain professional competence i n judicial administration, and facilitate the performance of the administrative responsibilities of other judges and court officials. (2) A judge should require his staff and court officials subject to his direction and control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to him. (3) A judge should take or initiate appropriate disciplinary measures against a judge or lawyer for unprofessional conduct of which the judge may become aware. (4) A judge should not make unnecessary appointments. He should exercise his power of appointment only on the basis of merit, avoiding nepotism and favoritism. He should not approve compensation of appointees beyond the fair value of services rendered. C. Disqualification. (1) On motion of any party, a judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality may reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (a) He has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceedings; (b) He served as lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning it; (c) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; Ethics-Page 20(d) He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person: (i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party; (ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding; (iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; (iv) Is to the judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding . (2) A judge should inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children residing in his household. (3) For the purposes of this section: (a) The degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil law system; (b) \"Fiduciary\" includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee and guardian; (c) \"Financial interest\" means ownership of a substantial legal or equitable interest ( i.e., an interest that would be significantly affected in value by the outcome of the subject legal proceeding), or a relationship as director or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that: (i) ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a \"financial interest\" in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund; (ii) an office in an educational, cultural, historical, religious, charitable, fraternal or c ivic organization is not a \"financial interest\" in securities held by the organization. D. Remittal of disqualification. Nothing in this Canon shall preclude a judge from disqualifying himself from participating in any proceeding upon his own initiative. Also, a judge potentially disqualified by the terms of Canon 3C may, instead of withdrawing from the proceeding, disclose on the record the basis of his potential disqualification. If, based on such disclosure, the parties and lawyers, on behalf of their clients and independently of the judge's participation, all agree in writing that the judge's basis for potential disqualification is immaterial or insubstantial, the judge is no longer disqualified, and may participate in the proceeding. The agreement, si gned by all lawyers, shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding. For purposes of this section, pro se parties shall be considered lawyers. Canon 4 A judge may participate in cultural or historical activities or engage in activities concerning the legal, economic, educational, or governmental system, or the administration of justice. A judge, subject to the proper performance of his judicial duties, may engage in the following quasi-judicial activities, if in doing so he does not cast substantial doubt on his capacity to decide impartially any issue that may come before him: A. He may speak, write, lecture, teach, participate in cultural or historical activities, or otherwise engage in activities concerning the economic, educational, legal, or go vernmental system, or the administration of justice. B. He may appear at a public hearing before an executive or legislative body or official with respect to activities permitted under Canon 4A or other provision of this Code, and he may otherwise consult with an executive or legislative body or official. C. He may serve as a member, officer or director of an organization or governmental agency concerning the activities described in Canon 4A, and may participate in its management and investment decisions. He may not actively assist such an organization in raising funds but may be Ethics-Page 21listed as a contributor on a fund-raising invitation. He may make recommendations to public and private fund -granting agencies regarding activities or projects undertaken by such an organization. Canon 5 A judge should regulate his extra -judicial activities to ensure that they do not prevent him from carrying out his judicial duties. A. Avocational activities. A judge may write, lecture, teach, and speak on legal or non- legal subjects, and engage in the arts, sports, and other social and recreational activities, if such avocational activities do not substantially interfere with the performance of his judicial duties. B. Civic and charitable activities. A judge may participate in civic and charitable activities that do not reflect adversely upon his impartiality or interfere with the performance of his judicial duties. A judge may serve as an officer, director, trustee, or non -legal advisor of an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic organization subject to the following limitations. (1) A judge should not serve if it is likely that the organization will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before him. (2) A judge may be listed as an officer, director or trustee of any cultural, educational, historical, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic organization. He may not actively assist such an organization in raising funds but may be listed as a contributor on a fund- raising invitation. (3) A judge may serve on the board of directors or board of trustees of such an organization even though the board has the responsibility for approving investment decisions. C. Financial activities. (1) A judge should refrain from financial and business dealings that reflect adversely on his impartiality, interfere with the proper performance of his judicial duties, exploit his judicial position or involve him in frequent transactions with lawyers or persons likely to come before the court on which he serves. (2) Subj ect to the requirements of subsection (1), a judge may hold and manage his own personal investments or those of his spouse, children, or parents, including real estate investments, and may engage in other remunerative activity not otherwise inconsistent wi th the provisions of this Code but should not serve as an officer, director or manager of any business. (3) A judge should manage his investments and other financial interests to minimize the number of cases in which he is disqualified. (4) Neither a judge nor a member of his family residing in his household should accept a gift from anyone except as follows: (a) A judge may accept a gift incident to a public testimonial to him; books supplied by publishers on a complimentary basis for official or academic use; or an invitation to the judge and his spouse to attend a bar-related function, a cultural or historical activity, or an event related to the economic, educational, legal, or governmental system, or the administration of justice; (b) A judge or a member of his family residing in his household may accept ordinary social hospitality; a gift, favor or loan from a friend or relative; a wedding, engagement or other special occasion gift; a loan from a lending institution in its regular course of business on the same terms generally available to persons who are not judges; or a scholarship or fellowship awarded on the same terms applied to other applicants; Ethics-Page 22(c) Other than as permitted under subsection C.(4)(b) of this Canon, a judge or a member of his family residing in his household may accept any other gift only if the donor is not a party presently before him and, if its value exceeds $500, the judge reports it in the same manner as he reports compensation in Canon 6C. (5) For the purposes of this section \"member of his family residing in his household\" means any relative of a judge by blood or marriage, or a person treated by a judge as a member of his family, who resides in his household. (6) A judge is not required by this Code to disclose his income, deb ts or investments, except as provided in this Canon and Canons 3 and 6. (7) Information acquired by a judge in his judicial capacity should not be used or disclosed by him in financial dealings or for any other purpose not related to his judicial duties. D. Fiduciary activities. A judge should not serve as the executor, administrator, trustee, guardian or other fiduciary, except for the estate, trust or person of a member of his family, and then only if such service will not interfere with the proper performance of his judicial duties. \"Member of his family\" includes a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or any other relative of the judge by blood or marriage. As a family fiduciary a judge is subject to the following restrictions: (1) He should not serve if it is likely that as a fiduciary he will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before him, or if the estate, trust or ward becomes involved in adversarial proceedings in the court on which he serves or one under its appellate jur isdiction. (2) While acting as a fiduciary a judge is subject to the same restrictions on financial activities that apply to him in his personal capacity. E. Arbitration. A judge should not act as an arbitrator or mediator. However, an emergency justice o r judge of the Appellate Division designated as such pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of North Carolina, and an Emergency Judge of the District Court or Superior Court commissioned as such pursuant to Article 8 of Chapter 7A of t he General Statutes of North Carolina may serve as an arbitrator or mediator when such service does not conflict with or interfere with the justice's or judge's judicial service in emergency status. A judge of the Appellate Division may participate in any dispute resolution program conducted at the Court of Appeals and authorized by the Supreme Court. F. Practice of law. A judge should not practice law. G. Extra -judicial appointments. A judge should not accept appointment to a committee, commission, or other body concerned with issues of fact or policy on matters other than those relating to cultural or historical matters, the economic, educational, legal or governmental system, or the administration of justice. A judge may represent his country, state or locality on ceremonial occasions or in connection with historical, educational or cultural activities. Canon 6 A judge should regularly file reports of compensation received for quasi -judicial and extra - judicial activities. A judge may receive compensation, honoraria and reimbursement of expenses for the quasi- judicial and extra- judicial activities permitted by this Code, subject to the following restrictions: A. Compensation and honoraria. Compensation and honoraria should not exceed a reasonable amoun t. Ethics-Page 23B. Expense reimbursement. Expense reimbursement should be limited to the actual cost of travel, food and lodging reasonably incurred by the judge and, where appropriate to the occasion, by his spouse. Any payment in excess of such an amount is compensation. C. Public reports. A judge shall report the name and nature of any source or activity from which he received more than $2,000 in income during the calendar year for which the report is filed. Any required report shall be made annually and filed as a public document as follows: The members of the Supreme Court shall file such reports with the Clerk of the Supreme Court; the members of the Court of Appeals shall file such reports with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals; and each Superior Court Judge, regular, special, and emergency, and each District Court Judge, shall file such report with the Clerk of the Superior Court of the county in which he resides. For each calendar year, such report shall be filed, absent good cause shown, not later than May 15th of the following year. Canon 7 A judge may engage in political activity consistent with his status as a public official. The provisions of Canon 7 are designed to strike a balance between two important but competing considerations: (1) the need for an i mpartial and independent judiciary and (2) in light of the continued requirement that judicial candidates run in public elections as mandated by the Constitution and laws of North Carolina, the right of judicial candidates to engage in constitutionally protected political activity. To promote clarity and to avoid potentially unfair application of the provisions of this Code, subsection B of Canon 7 establishes a safe harbor of permissible political conduct. A. Terminology. For the purposes of this Canon only, the following definitions apply. (1) A \"candidate\" is a person actively and publicly seeking election to judicial office. A person becomes a candidate for judicial office as soon as he makes a public declaration of candidacy, declares or files as a can didate with the appropriate election authority, authorizes solicitation or acceptance of contributions or public support, or sends a letter of intent to the chair of the Judicial Standards Commission. The term \"candidate\" has the same meaning when applied to a judge seeking election to a non- judicial office. (2) To \"solicit\" means to directly, knowingly and intentionally make a request, appeal or announcement, public or private, oral or written, whether in person or through the press, radio, television, telephone, Internet, billboard, or distribution and circulation of printed materials, that expressly requests other persons to contribute, give, loan or pledge any money, goods, labor, services or real property interest to a specific individual's efforts to be elected to public office. (3) To \"endorse\" means to knowingly and expressly request, appeal or announce publicly, orally or in writing, whether in person or through the press, radio, television, telephone, Internet, billboard or distribution and circulation of printed materials, that other persons should support a specific individual in his efforts to be elected to public office. B. Permissible political conduct. A judge or a candidate may: (1) attend, preside over, and speak at any political party gathering, meeting or other convocation, including a fund-raising function for himself, another individual or group of individuals seeking election to office and the judge or candidate may be listed or noted within any publicity relating to such an event, so long as he does not expressly endorse a candidate (other than himself) for a specific office or expressly solicit funds from the audience during the event; Ethics-Page 24(2) if he is a candidate, endorse any individual seeking election to any office or conduct a joint campaign with and endorse other individuals seeking election to judicial office, including the solicitation of funds for a joint judicial campaign; (3) identify himself as a member of a political party and make financial contributions to a political party or organization; provided, however, that he may not personally make financial contributions or loans to any individual seeking election to office (other than himself) except as part of a joint judicial campaign as permitted in subsection B(2); (4) pers onally solicit campaign funds and request public support from anyone for his own campaign or, alternatively, and in addition thereto, authorize or establish committees of responsible persons to secure and manage the solicitation and expenditure of campaign funds; (5) become a candidate either in a primary or in a general election for a judicial office provided that he should resign his judicial office prior to becoming a candidate either in a party primary or in a general election for a non- judicial office ; (6) engage in any other constitutionally protected political activity. C. Prohibited political conduct. A judge or a candidate should not: (1) solicit funds on behalf of a political party, organization, or an individual (other than himself) seeking el ection to office, by specifically asking for such contributions in person, by telephone, by electronic media, or by signing a letter, except as permitted under subsection B of this Canon or otherwise within this Code; (2) endorse a candidate for public office except as permitted under subsection B of this Canon or otherwise within this Code; (3) intentionally and knowingly misrepresent his identity or qualifications. D. Political conduct of family members. The spouse or other family member of a judge or a candidate is permitted to engage in political activity. Limitation of Proceedings Disciplinary proceedings to redress alleged violations of Canon 7 of this Code must be commenced within three months of the act or omission allegedly giving rise to the vi olation. Disciplinary proceedings to redress alleged violations of all other provisions of this Code must be commenced within three years of the act or omission allegedly giving rise to the violation; provided, however, that disciplinary proceedings may be instituted at any time against a judge convicted of a felony during his tenure in judicial office. Scope and Effective Date of Compliance The provisions of Canon 7 of this Code shall apply to judges and candidates for judicial office. The other provisio ns of this Code shall become effective as to a judge upon the administration of the judge's oath to the office of judge; provided, however, that it shall be permissible for a newly installed judge to facilitate or assist in the transfer of his prior duties as legal counsel but he may not be compensated therefor. Ethics-Page 25 Ethics-Page 26 Published on NAACP LDF (http://www.naacpldf.org) Home > Our Work > News Updates > ABA-LDF Joint Statement on Eliminating Bias in t he Criminal Justice System ABA-LDF Joint Statement on Eliminating Bias in the Criminal Justice System 7/16/15 Related Case or Issue: Policing Reform Campaign [1] The American Bar Association and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. have long and proud traditions of fighting for civil righ ts, human rights and equal justice. Although, over the years, we have celebrated much progress in these arenas, we are now confronted by a troubling and destabilizing loss of public confidence in the Americ an criminal just ice system. The growing skepticism about the integrity of the cr iminal justice system is driven by real and perceived evidence of racial bi as among some representatives of that system. This crisis of confidence must be addressed, and the time to act is now. While we believe that the overwhelming percentage of law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges are not racist, explicit bias remains a real factor in our country -and criminal justice system - and implicit or unconscious bias affects even those who may believe themselves to be fair. Indeed, as Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy once observed (in the 2001 case of Board of Trustees v. Garrett ), prejudice may arise from not just overt \"malice or hostile animus alone,\" but also \"insensitivity caused by simple want of careful, rational reflection or from some instinctive mechanism to guard against people who appear to be different in respects from ourselves.\" One would have to have been outside of the United States and cut off from media to be unaware of the recent spate of killings of unarmed Afri can American men and women at the hands of white law enforcement officers. Several of these killings , like those of Walter Scott in South Carolina, 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Ohio, and Eric Garner in New York, have been captured by citizen video and viewed nationwide. More recently, the in-custody death of Freddie Gray sparked days of unrest in Baltimore City, which ended only when the officers (who were of multiple races) were charged by the local prosecutor. Given the history of implicit and explicit racial bias and discrimination in this country, there has long been a strained relationship between the African-American community and law enforcement. But with video cameras and extensive news coverage bringing images and stories Page 1 of 6 ABA-LDF Joint Statement on Eliminating Bi as in the Criminal Justice Syste m 12/8/2015 http://www.naacpldf.org/print/press- release/joint-statement-eliminatin g-bias-crimina l-justi...of violent encounters between (mostly white) law enforcement officers and (almost exclusively African-American and Latino) unarmed individuals into American homes, it is not surprising that the absence of criminal charges in many of these cases has caused so many people to doubt the ability of the criminal justice syst em to treat indi viduals fairly, impartially, and without regard to their race. That impression is reinforced by the statistics on race in our criminal justice system. With approximately 5% of the world's population, the United States has approximately 25% of the world's jail and prison population. Some two-thirds of those incarcerated are persons of color. While crime rates may vary by neighborhood and class, it is difficult to believe that racial disparities in arrest, prosecution, conviction, an d incarceration rates are unaffected by attitudes and biases regarding race. And, to the extent that doubts remain, the U.S. Department of Justice's recent investigation of law enforcement practices in Ferguson , Missouri, should put them to rest. In Ferguson, the Justice Department found that the dramatically different rates at which African-American and White individuals in Ferguson were stopped, searched, ci ted, arrested, and subjected to the use of force could not be explained by chance or differences in the rates at which African-American and White individuals violated the law. These disparities ca n be explained at least in part by taking into account racial bias. Given these realities, it is not only time for a ca reful look at what caused the current crisis, but also time to initiate an affirmative effort to eradicate implied or perceived racial bias - in all of its forms - from the criminal justice system. As lawyers, we have a very sp ecial role to play. As the Preamble to the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct states, As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek impr ovement of the law, acce ss to the legal system, the administration of justice and the quality of se rvice rendered by the legal profession. . . . In addition, a lawyer should further the public's understanding of and confidence in the rule of law and the justice system because legal institutions in a constitutional demo cracy depend on popular participation and support to maintain their authority. What must we do? The answer lies in making both macro and micro changes in our criminal justice system. At the macro level, Congress and state legislatures must look at the vast array of laws that criminalize behaviors that pose little, if any, danger to society. We have over-criminalized conduct throughout the United States and have come inappropriately to rely on the criminal justice system to address problems of mental health an d poverty. We have adopted unnecessary zero-tolerance policies in schools that inappropriately require police officers to take the place of teachers and principals and become behavioral judges. We need fewer criminal laws, and fewer circumstances in which police, prosecutors, and judges are called upon to deal with social, as opposed to criminal, issues. Over-criminalization is such a significant problem that virtually every careful observer of criminal justice in America, conservative or liberal, recognizes it. This consensus presents a unique opportunity to unflinchingly confront the need to improve our justice system. De-criminalization is, however, not a short-term soluti on to the current crisis of confidence. Every day, law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges are making discretionary decisions in a country where, literally, any person could be arrested for something if government officials focused sufficient time and energy on him or her.Page 2 of 6 ABA-LDF Joint Statement on Eliminating Bi as in the Criminal Justice Syste m 12/8/2015 http://www.naacpldf.org/print/press- release/joint-statement-eliminatin g-bias-crimina l-justi...We must therefore take immediate action at the micro level to begin the process of rebuilding trust and confidence in the crim inal justice system and fulfilli ng the promise of equal justice. Prosecutors play an important and vital role within the criminal just ice system and should be leaders in this effort. We have begun what we anticipate will be a series of conversations focused on identifying ways in which prosecutors can play a more powerful role in addressing the problem of racial bias in our justice system. Our organiza tions arranged an off-th e-record discussion that included prosecutors and other pa rticipants in the criminal ju stice system committed to equal justice. We emerged from our discussion with a commitment to advancing the reforms listed below. We regard these reforms as necessary investments that are essential to strengthening public confidence in the rule of law and the legitimacy of our justice system. 1. We need better data on the variety of interactions between law enforcement and citizens. Earlier this year FBI Director James Comey - himself a former federal prosecutor - acknowledged that gathering better and more reliable data about encounters between the police and citizens is \"the first step to understanding what is really going on in our communities and our country.\" Data related to violent encounters is particularly important. As Director Comey remarked, \"It's ridiculous that I can't know how many people were shot by police.\" Police departments should be encouraged to make and keep reports on the racial identities of individuals stopped and frisked, arrested, ticketed, or warned for automobile and other infractions. Police departments should report incidents in which serious or deadly force is used by officers and include the race of the officer(s) and that of the civilian(s). This will certainly require investment of funds, but that in vestment is key to a bett er future. We cannot understand what we cannot measure, and we cannot change what we cannot understand. 2. Prosecutors should collect and publicly disclose more data about their work that can enable the public to obtain a better understanding of the extent to which racial disparities arise from the exercise of prosecutorial discretio n. While this data collection will also require investment of funds, it is essential to achieving the goal of eliminating racial bias in the criminal justice system. 3. Prosecutors and police should seek expert assistance from organizations with expertise in conducting objective analyses to identify and localize unexplained racial disparities. These and similar organizations can provide evidence-based analyses and propose protocols to address any identified racial disparities. 4. Prosecutors' offices, defense counsel, and judges should seek expert assistance to implement training on implicit bias for their employees. An understanding of the science of implicit bias will pave the way for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges to address it in their individual work. There should also be post-training evaluations to determine the effectiveness of the training. 5. Prosecutors' offices must move quickly, ag gressively, unequivocally - and yet deliberately - to address misconduct that reflects explicit racial bias. We must make clear that such conduct is fundamentally incompatible with our shared values and that it has an outsized impact on the public's perception of the fairness of the system. 6. Prosecutors' offices and law enforcement agencies should make efforts to hire and retain lawyers and officers who live in and reflect the communities they serve. Prosecutors and police should be encouraged to engage with the community by participating in community forums, civic group meetings, and neighborhood events. Prosecutors' offices should build relationships with African-American and minority communities to improve their understanding about how and why these communities may view events differently from prosecutors.Page 3 of 6 ABA-LDF Joint Statement on Eliminating Bi as in the Criminal Justice Syste m 12/8/2015 http://www.naacpldf.org/print/press- release/joint-statement-eliminatin g-bias-crimina l-justi...7. There should be a dialogue among all the stakeholders in each jurisdiction about race and how it affects criminal justice decision making. In 2004, the ABA Justice Kennedy Commission recommended the formation of Racial Justice Task Forces - which would consist of representatives of the judiciary, law enforcement and prosecutors, defenders and defense counsel, probation and parole officers, and community organizations - to examine the racial impact that policing priorities and prosecutorial and judicial decisions might produce and whether alternative approaches that do not produce racial disparities might be implemented without compromising public safety. There is little cost associated with the assembly of such Task Forces, and they can develop solutions that could be applicable to a variety of jurisdictions provided that the various stakeholders were willing to do the hard work of talking honestly and candidly about race. 8. As surprising as it might seem, many people do not understand what prosecutors do. Hence, prosecutors' offices, with the help of local and state bar associations, should seek out opportunities to explain their function and the kinds of decisions they are routinely called upon to make. Local and state bar associations and other community organizations should help to educate the public that the decision not to prosecute is often as important as the decision to prosecute; that prosecutors today should not to be judged solely by conviction rates, but, instead, by the fairness and judgment reflected in their decisions and by their success in making communities sa fer for all their members; an d that some of the most innovative alternatives to traditional prosecut ion and punishment - like diversion and re-entry programs, drug and veteran courts, and drug treatment - have been instigated, developed, and supported by prosecutors. 9. To ensure accountability, the public should have access to evidence explaining why grand juries issued \"no true bills\" and why prosecutors declined to prosecute police officers involved in fatal shootings of unarmed civilians. The release of grand jury evidence, as in Ferguson, is one way to promote the needed accountability. 10. Accountability can also be promoted by greater use of body and vehicle cameras to create an actual record of police-citizen encounters. With the proliferation of powerful firearms in our communities, law enforcement departments reasonably seek equipment that enable them to protect themselves and their communities when called upon to confront armed and dangerous individuals seeking to engage in criminal or terrorist acts. However, while it is appropriate to arm our police and train them in the use of ever more powerful weapons, it is equally important to train our law enforcement officers in techniques designed to de-escalate tense situations, make accurate judgments about when use of force is essential, and properly determine the appropriat e amount of force required in each situation. 11. We must recognize that not every lawyer has the judgment and personal qualities to be a successful prosecutor, do justice, and be willing to acknowledge the possibility of implicit bias. Prosecutors who routinely engage in conduct or make decisions that call into question the fairness or integrity of their offices should be removed from office if they cannot be trained to meet the high standards expected of public officers. At the same time, the terms \"prosecutorial misconduct\" and \"police misconduct\" should be used with greater care. Even the best prosecutors will make mistakes, much like the best defense lawyers and judges do. There is good reason to limit the characterizati on of \"misconduct\" to intentional acts that violate legal or ethical rules. 12. Prosecutors, judges, and defense counsel must pay more attention to the collateral consequences of convictions. In many jurisdictions, after an individual is convicted of an offense and completes his or her sentence (by serving time, paying a fine, or completing probation or parole), the individual nevertheless faces a life sentence of disqualification and Page 4 of 6 ABA-LDF Joint Statement on Eliminating Bi as in the Criminal Justice Syste m 12/8/2015 http://www.naacpldf.org/print/press- release/joint-statement-eliminatin g-bias-crimina l-justi...deprivation of educational, employment, housing, and other opportunities. This runs counter to the interests we all share in rehabilitation of the offender and positive re-integration into and engagement with the communities in which they live. In many cases, prosecutions can be structured to limit some of the most pernicious of these consequences, provided that the lawyers and the courts take the time and care to examine alternative disposition options. Prosecutors, judges, and defense counsel shoul d join together to urge legislatures and administrative agencies to reconsider the laws and regulations that impose these collateral consequences and determine whether they can be modified to provide more opportunities for former offenders without compromising public safety. The American criminal justice system is unquesti onably at a moment of crisis. But there are many steps we, as members of the bar, can and should take quickly to begin to turn the ship of justice around and ensure that the system delivers the blind justice that it promises. If we commit ourselves to confronting and eliminating the racial biases that now exist, we can restore the much-needed public conf idence in our criminal justice system. As Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall once exhorted in accepting the Liberty Medal Award in 1992, \"America can do better.\" Indeed, \"America has no choice but to do better.\" Both the American Bar Association and the Legal Defense Fund will continue to convene meetings with prosecutors and other law enforc ement groups to support the reforms we have identified. We also will work to support and advance a robust dialogue among prosecutors and leaders in the profession about how best to elimin ate racial bias from our justice system. William C.

Criminal contempt is used to punish for acts that disrupt a court proceeding or show disrespect, and also can be used for violation of court orders. Criminal contempt can be direct or indirect. Direct criminal contempt occurs in the court 's presence; indirect does not. Criminal contempt can be punished by imprisonment and/or a fine. Civil contempt is used to get someone to comply with a court order. There is no distinction between direct and indirect civil contempt; in any event, virtually all civil contempt takes place outside the court's presen ce. The only means of enforcing civil contempt is to imprison the person until the person complies with the court order. Magistrate's authority A magistrate's authority to use contemp t is stated in G.S. 7A-292(2). A magistrate may punish only for direct criminal contempt. That is, a magistrate may punish only for criminal contempt that takes place in the magistrate's presence. Any other kind of contempt must be referred to a district court judge. Meaning of criminal contempt Criminal contempt is defined in G.S. 5A-11. Only the acts listed in the statute may be punished by criminal contempt. The contemptuous acts listed in G.S. 5A-11 most likely to be committed directly before a magistrate are: \"Willful behavior committed during the sitting of a court and directly tending to interrupt its proceedings.\" \"Willful behavior committed during the sitting of a court in its immediate view and presence and directly tending to impair the respect due its authority.\" Contempt - Page 1 2 It is also possible, though less likely, that this form of criminal contempt will be committed directly before a magistrate: \"Willful refusal to be sworn or affirmed as a witness, or, when so sworn or affirmed, willful refusal to answer any legal and proper question when the refusal is not legally justifie d.\" One can also think of unusual situations in which the following forms of criminal contempt could occur directly before a magistrate, but most often they would not be direct contempt because the magistrate would not have actually observed the violation: \"Willful disobedience of, resistance to, or interference with a court's lawful process, order, directive, or instruction or its execution.\" \"Willful or grossly negligent failure to comply with schedules and practices of the court resulting in substantia l interference with the business of the court.\" Meaning of direct contempt G.S. 5A-13 says that an act is direct criminal contempt only when the act: \"(1) Is committed within the sight and hearing or a presiding judicial official; and (2) Is committed in, or in immediate proximity to, the room where proceedings are being held before the court; and (3) Is likely to interrupt or interfere with matters then before the court.\" Summary or plenary proceeding Contempt may be dealt with in a summary proceeding or a plenary proceeding. A summary proceeding means that the magistrate deals with the contempt right then and there as it occurs. That choice is always available for direct contempt. If for whatever reason the magistrate does not wish to deal with the contempt immediately, the magistrate may issue a show cause order for the defendant to appear before a district judge at a later time for a plenary proceeding. A summary proceeding is an on-the-spot quick determination of contempt; a plenary proceeding is more like a regularly-scheduled trial. The summary proceeding At a summary proceeding for direct criminal contempt the magistrate must tell the person that the magistrate is considering holding the person in contempt; describe what the person did tha t was contemptuous; and give the person a chance to respond why it is not contempt. Even if the conduct which is the basis for contempt is obvious to everyone, and it is clear that the defendant has no good excuse, the magistrate still must explain the basis for the contempt and still must give the defendant an opportunity to respond. The magistrate should also inform the person that contempt can be punished by imprisonment for up to 30 days and a fine of up to $500. Contempt - Page 2 3 The summary proceeding must be held \"substantially contemporaneously\" with the contempt. As a practical matter that means just as soon as the contempt occurs or within a few minutes thereafter. There can be situations in which it is permissible to delay the summary proceeding for a day or so, but a magistrate should not attempt to do that. If the contempt proceeding is not going to be held right away the magistrate should issue a show cause order for the defendant to appear before a district judge at a later time. G.S. 15A-511(a)(3) says that if a defendant at an initial appearance is so unruly or is unconscious or so intoxicated as to be unable to understand what is going on the magistrate can order the person held for a short time before conducting the initial appearance. If the defendant 's unruliness includes contemptuous behavior, the magistrate may wait on the summary proceeding until the defendant is brought back for the initial appearance. If the defendant acts contemptuously but is too intoxicated for the initial appearance or for an orderly summary proceeding, the defendant probably is not capable of acting willfully (see below) and contempt is not appropriate. G.S. 5A-16(a) authorizes a magistrate to order a person being charged with direct criminal contempt to be held and restrain ed \"to the extent necessary to assure his presence fo r summary proceedings . . . .\" That statute should be used only when necessary to keep the person from fleeing. A magistrate conducting a summary proceeding should use form AOC- CR-390. The form should describe in detail the behavior that was contemptuous, including direct quotation of words that were spoken. Show-cause order for a plenary proceeding Although direct criminal contempt always may be punished summarily, it does not have to be done summarily. The magistrate may choose to issue a show cause order and direct the person to appear before a district court judge in a plenary proceeding. The plenary proceeding should be used when the person is so belligerent or disruptive that it is not possible to conduct a summary proceeding; when the office is too busy to stop for a summary proceeding; or when the magistrate has become too personally involved to decide the contempt. The form a magistrate should use for a show-cause order for contempt is AOC- CR-219, but the form is not designed for the most common kind of direct criminal contempt. The simplest way to use the form usually will be to check box IV for \"Failure To Obey Other Order Of the Court\" but strike through that heading and substitute \"Interruption of Court Proceeding\" or \"Disrespect to Court\" and then describe the behavior which is contemptuous. Willfulness and warning G.S. 5A-12(b) provides that a person may be punished for criminal contempt only if the person's actions are \"willfully contemptuous\" or the person was given \"a clear warning by the court that the conduct is improper.\" Willfulness has been defined by appellate court opinions to mean \"more than deliberation or conscious choice; it also imports a bad faith disregard for autho rity Contempt - Page 3 4 and the law.\" Some acts such as spitting at a magistrate or yelling profanity or kicking a table are willfully contemptuous by their nature and so inherently disruptive and disrespectful that no warning is needed. However, when the defendant is doing something less disrespectful and disruptive, such as talking so much that no one else can speak or refusing to sit down and await one's turn to be heard, the magistrate must warn the person that the behavior is unacceptable before using contempt. To avoid later questions about whether the contempt was \"willfully contemptuous,\" it is better for the magistrate to always give a warning before holding a person in contempt. The willfully contemptuous defendant is not likely to stop just because of the warning. Right to counsel If a lawyer is present with a person charged with direct contempt, of course the lawyer may represent the defendant in the summary contempt proceeding. It is not necessary to delay the summary hearing to allow the defendant to get a lawyer, however. And it is not necessary to appoint a lawyer to represent an indigent defendant in a summary contempt proceeding. If the contempt is not addressed summarily by the magistrate and instead proceeds to a plenary hearing before a judge, the indigent defendant is entitled to have counsel appointed. Recusal Contemptuous conduct often can be very personal. A defendant may use degrading terms to speak to the magistrate and may be openly hostile in close quarters. In those circumstances the magistrate may feel personally insulted and want to get back at the defendant. If anything about the contemptuous behavior causes a magistrate to feel that way, the magistrate should not conduct a summary proceeding for contempt but instead should issue a show-cause order and allow the contempt charge to be heard by a judge at a later time. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt The standard for criminal contempt is the same as for conviction of a crime: A person may not be held in criminal contempt unless the contempt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Because direct contempt occurs in the presence of the magistrate, the magistrate's own view of the defendant's conduct will establish the proof. Punishment G.S. 5A-12 sets out the punishment for criminal contempt. The possible punishments include censure, imprisonment for up to 30 days, a fine of not more than $500, or any combination of those three options. A magistrate will not use censure, leaving imprisonment and a fine as the choices. Before sentencing a defendant to jail for contempt, or imposing a fine, the magistrate should consider how the penalty will compare with the punishment a defendant likely would Contempt - Page 4 5 receive for conviction of a crime. If a fine is being imposed, the magistrate needs to consider the person' s ability to pay. Although it will not be appropriate in most instances when a magistrate holds a person in contempt, the sentence for criminal contempt may be suspended with conditions, just as for other criminal offenses. If a magistrate sentences a defendant to jail for criminal contempt, the magistrate may go back and reduce or terminate the sentence at any time. For example, if a magistrate sentenced a person to jail for two days for contempt, the magistrate could terminate the sentence after one day. Likewise, if a magistrate imposes a fine the magistrate may later reduce or eliminate the fine. Appeal Appeal for criminal contempt is from the magistrate to superior court. The appeal is for a hearing de novo . G.S. 5A-17 provides that an appeal from criminal contempt is the same as an appeal in a criminal action. The statute on criminal appeals generally, G.S. 15A-1451, provides that the payment of a fine and costs is stayed upon the defendant 's giving notice of appeal, but confinement is stayed only when the defendant is released pursuant to the bail statutes. Thus, if the defendant gives notice of appeal from a sanction of criminal contempt the payment of any fine is stayed automatically but the defendant starts serving the jail time until released on bail. Starting December 1, 2013, G.S. 5A-17 will require that the bail hearing be held by a district judge when a magistrate orders someone to jail for criminal contempt and that the hearing has to be within 24 hours. If a district judge has not held the bail hearing within 24 hours, any other judicial official may do so. Contempt - Page 5 Contempt - Page 6NC General Statutes - Chapter 5A Article 1 1 Chapter 5A.

(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), each of the following is criminal contempt: (1) Willful behavior committed during the sitting of a court and directly tending to interrupt its proceedings. (2) Willful behavior committed during the sitting of a court in its immediate view and presence and directly tending to impair the respect due its authority. (3) Willful disobedience of, resistance to, or interference with a court's lawful process, order, directive, or instruction or its execution. (4) Willful refusal to be sworn or affirmed as a witness, or, when so sworn or affirmed, willful refusal to answer any legal and proper question when the refusal is not legally justified. (5) Willful publication of a report of the proceedings in a court that is grossly inaccurate and presents a clear and present danger of imminent and serious threat to the administration of justice, made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false. No person, however, may be punished for publishing a truthful report of proceedings in a court. (6) Willful or grossly negligent failure by an officer of the court to perform his duties in an official transaction. (7) Willful or grossly negligent failure to comply with schedules and practices of the court resulting in substantial interference with the business of the court.

(9) Willful communication with a juror in an improper attempt to influence his deliberations. (9a) Willful refusal by a defendant to comply with a condition of probation. (10) Any other act or omission specified elsewhere in the General Statutes of North Carolina as grounds for criminal contempt. The grounds for criminal contempt specified here are exclusive, regardless of any other grounds for criminal contempt which existed at common law. (b) No person may be held in contempt under this section on the basis of the content of any broadcast, publication, or other communication unless it presents a clear and present danger of an imminent and serious threat to the administration of criminal justice. (c) This section is subject to the provisions of G.S. 7A-276.1, Court orders prohibiting publication or broadcast of reports of open court proceedings or reports of public records banned. (1977, c. 711, s. 3; 1994, Ex. Sess., c. 19, s. 1.) \u00a7 5A-12. Punishment; circumstances for fine or imprisonment; reduction of punishment; other measures. (a) A person who commits criminal contempt, whether direct or indirect, is subject to censure, imprisonment up to 30 days, fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), or any combination of the three, except that: Contempt - Page 7NC General Statutes - Chapter 5A Article 1 2 (1) A person who commits a contempt described in G.S. 5A-11(8) is subject to censure, imprisonment not to exceed 6 months, fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), or any combination of the three; (2) A person who has not been arrested who fails to comply with a nontestimonial identification order, issued pursuant to Article 14 of Chapter 15A of the General Statutes is subject to censure, imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), or any combination of the three; and (3) A person who commits criminal contempt by failing to comply with an order to pay child support is subject to censure, imprisonment up to 30 days, fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), or any combination of the three. However, a sentence of imprisonment up to 120 days may be imposed for a single act of criminal contempt resulting from the failure to pay child support, provided the sentence is suspended upon conditions reasonably related to the contemnor's payment of child support. (b) Except for contempt under G.S. 5A-11(5) or 5A-11(9), fine or imprisonment may not be imposed for criminal contempt, whether direct or indirect, unless: (1) The act or omission was willfully contemptuous; or (2) The act or omission was preceded by a clear warning by the court that the conduct is improper. (c) The judicial official who finds a person in contempt may at any time withdraw a censure, terminate or reduce a sentence of imprisonment, or remit or reduce a fine imposed as punishment for contempt if warranted by the conduct of the contemnor and the ends of justice. (d) A person held in criminal contempt under this Article shall not, for the same conduct, be found in civil contempt under Article 2 of this Chapter, Civil Contempt. (e) A person held in criminal contempt under G.S. 5A-11(9) may nevertheless, for the same conduct, be found guilty of a violation of G.S. 14-225.1, but he must be given credit for any imprisonment resulting from the contempt. (1977, c. 711, s. 3; 1985 (Reg. Sess., 1986), c. 843, s. 1; 1987 (Reg. Sess., 1988), c. 1040, ss. 2, 4; 1989 (Reg. Sess., 1990), c. 1039, s. 4; 686, 3; s. 1.) \u00a7 5A-13. Direct and indirect criminal contempt; proceedings required. (a) Criminal contempt is direct criminal contempt when the act: (1) Is committed within the sight or hearing of a presiding judicial official; and (2) Is committed in, or in immediate proximity to, the room where proceedings are being held before the court; and (3) Is likely to interrupt or interfere with matters then before the court. The presiding judicial official may punish summarily for direct criminal contempt according to the requirements of G.S. 5A-14 or may defer adjudication and sentencing as provided in G.S. 5A-15. If proceedings for direct criminal contempt are deferred, the judicial official must, immediately following the conduct, inform the person of his intention to institute contempt proceedings. (b) Any criminal contempt other than direct criminal contempt is indirect criminal contempt and is punishable only after proceedings in accordance with the procedure required by G.S. 5A-15. (1977, c. 711, s. 3.) \u00a7 5A-14. Summary proceedings for contempt. (a) The presiding judicial official may summarily impose measures in response to direct criminal contempt when necessary to restore order or maintain the dignity and authority of the court and when the measures are imposed substantially contemporaneously with the contempt. Contempt - Page 8NC General Statutes - Chapter 5A Article 1 3 (b) Before imposing measures under this section, the judicial official must give the person charged with contempt summary notice of the charges and a summary opportunity to respond and must find facts supporting the summary imposition of measures in response to contempt. The facts must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. (1977, c. 711, s. 3.) \u00a7 5A-15. Plenary proceedings for contempt. (a) When a judicial official chooses not to proceed summarily against a person charged with direct criminal contempt or when he may not proceed summarily, he may proceed by an order directing the person to appear before a judge at a reasonable time specified in the order and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court. A copy of the order must be furnished to the person charged. If the criminal contempt is based upon acts before a judge which so involve him that his objectivity may reasonably be questioned, the order must be returned before a different judge. (b) Proceedings under this section are before a district court judge unless a court superior to the district court issued the order, in which case the proceedings are before that court. Venue lies throughout the district court district as defined in G.S. 7A-133 or superior court district or set of districts as defined in G.S. 7A-41.1, as the case may be, where the order was issued. (c) The person ordered to show cause may move to dismiss the order. (d) The judge is the trier of facts at the show cause hearing. (e) The person charged with contempt may not be compelled to be a witness against himself in the hearing. (f) At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge must enter a finding of guilty or not guilty. If the person is found to be in contempt, the judge must make findings of fact and enter judgment. The facts must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. (g) The judge presiding over the hearing may appoint a prosecutor or, in the event of an apparent conflict of interest, some other member of the bar to represent the court in hearings for criminal contempt. (1977, c. 711, s. 3; 1987 (Reg. Sess., 1988), c. 1037, s. 44.) \u00a7 5A-16. Custody of person charged with criminal contempt. (a) A judicial official may orally order that a person he is charging with direct criminal contempt be taken into custody and restrained to the extent necessary to assure his presence for summary proceedings or notice of plenary proceedings. (b) If a judicial official who initiates plenary proceedings for contempt under G.S. 5A-15 finds, based on sworn statement or affidavit, probable cause to believe the person ordered to appear will not appear in response to the order, he may issue an order for arrest of the person, pursuant to G.S. 15A-305. A person arrested under this subsection is entitled to release under the provisions of Article 26, Bail, of Chapter 15A of the General Statutes. (1977, c. 711, s. 3.) \u00a7 5A-17. Appeals. A person found in criminal contempt may appeal in the manner provided for appeals in criminal actions, except appeal from a finding of contempt by a judicial official inferior to a superior court judge is by hearing de novo before a superior court judge.

There are special rules for special kinds of contracts: Breach of warranty (pp. 6165) Installment sales contracts (pp. Loans (pp. 9091, 96 97) Worthless check (pp. 8789) Actions on security agreement (p p. 125 144) Residential lease agreements (see numerous special provisions in Ch.VI, Landlord Tenant Law) Miscellaneous consumer protection provisions Contracts - Page 3The most common impact of these special rules is the revision or even removal of contract provisions inconsistent with them. For example, a landlord who contracts for a late fee that exceeds the statutory maximum loses the right to collect the fee at all. NOTES: WHAT WERE THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT? Best Evidence Rule: When an action by a party is based on a right created by a written contract, and the content of that contract is in dispute, the party must either produce the contract or adequately explain why he is unable to do so. Parol Evidence Rule : \"The parol evidence rule . . . prohibits the admission of parol evidence to vary, add to, or contradict a written instrument. . . . In subst antive terms, the rule is stated as follows: 'Any or all parts of a transaction prior to or contemporaneous with a writing intended to record them finally are superse ded and made legally ineffective by the writing.'\" Van Harris Realty, Inc. v. Coffey, 41 NC App 112. Verified Statement of Account : G.S. 8 45 provides that in an action on an account for goods sold, rents, services rendered, or labor performed, or any oral contract for money loaned, a verified itemized statement of the account is admissible into evidence and is deemed correct unless disputed by the defendant. \"Itemized\": describes each item with price and item number, if there is one. \"Verified\": Accompanied by an affidavit from a person who (1) wou ld be competent to testify at trial; (2) has personal knowledge of the particular account, or of the books and Contracts - Page 4records of the business in general; and (3) swears that the account is correct and presently is owed by defendant to plaintiff. Business records exception to hearsay rule : \"Writings or records of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with kn owledge are admissible if kept in the regular course of business and if it was the regular course of business to make that record, unless the source of information or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\" WHAT DAMAGES IS PLAINTIFF ENTITLED TO? Common damage items: 1. Direct damages (differ ence between value of promised performance and what it will cost now) 2. Incidental damages (costs of preparing to perform, those incurred in response to breach, those involved in minimizing injury) 3. Consequential damages (foreseeable damages resulting from breach) 4. Prejudgment interest from date of breach (s ee Appendix) 5. Attorney fees (requires contract + authorizing statute; see Appendix) Less common: Rescission (cancelling contract and returning all parties to original condition. Special cases: 1. Failure to return property: FMV of property 2. Breach of warranty: difference between FMV of goods as warranted and FMV of goods received 3. Checks NSF: Amount of check + bank charge + processi ng fee + amount of check x 3 ($100 $500) Be aware of law regulating duty to mitigate & liquidated damages provisions.

WHO ARE THE PARTIES TO THE CONTRACT? If parties are not identical to people who entered into contract, why not? Agency Guarantors Joint and Several Liability Husbands, Wives, and Kids WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT? If the agreement is in writing, ask for a copy. Read it carefully. Are the terms clear? If the agreement is not in writing, listen to the testimony about the terms. Do the parties agree about the terms of their agreement? If they don't agree, what specifically do they disagree abo ut? What does contend? What does contend? In the case of a disagreement, the magistrate must determine the terms, remembering that the party seeking to enforce the contract has the B/P on its terms. Are there terms they left out? Assuming the intent to contract is clear, the magistrate \"fills in the blanks\" based on evidence about what is usual and reasonable, to implement the probable intention of the parties. What rules of evidence should the magistrate be mindful of in determin ing the terms? If a contract is written, the best evidence of what the parties agreed to is the written contract. If a contract is written, evidence about what the parties sa id before signing the contract is not relevant unless meaning is unclear (parol evidence rule). In an action on an account, a verified itemized statement of the account is sufficient to prove that owes that amount of mo ney in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Are there additional or different terms written into the agreement by the law? In contracts for the sale of goods , is 's claim for breach of warranty? In actions based on a lease, does the landlord have additional responsibilities under the RRA A? In actions involving consumer credit sales, does the Retail Installment Sales Act affect any of the contract terms? Before moving to the next question, stop and decide what the terms of the agreement are. Contracts - Page 7Is the agreement one that the law will enforce? Does it involve a bargained for exchange? Is this particular defendant (rather than someone else) bound by the contract? Does the contract involve a corporation? Does the contract involve an agency relationship? Is there any question about 's ability to consent? Was a minor at the time of the contract? Is there doubt about 's competence to contract? Is there a legal rule that renders this agreement unenforceable? Is this one of the kinds of contracts the law requires to be written? Did wait too long to file the lawsuit? Are the terms of the agreement so onesided and unfair as to be unconscionable ? DID BREACH THE CONTRACT? WHAT DAMAGES IS ENTITLED TO?

A landlord has no authority to d o anything with a tenant's prop erty until the landlord has brought a summary ejectment act ion, won a judgment for possessi on, and had the sheriff execute a writ of possession to enforce the judgment. In 2013 the General Assembly changed the law to require the s heriff to execute a writ of pos session within five days of receiving it. oThe need for the landlord to deal with property remaining will arise only if the landlord selects the padlocking method of execution. After the sheriff padlocks the p remises under a writ of possess ion, the landlord must hold property for seven days and then may dispose of any items of pe rsonal property remaining on the premises. oDuring the seven-day period the landlord may remove the propert y and store it or may leave the property on the premises. oIf the tenant requests the prope rty during that seven-day perio d, the landlord must release the property to the tenant during regular business hours at an agreed upon time. If the landlord decides to sell the property , the landlord must give written notice to the tenant by first-class mail to the tenant's last known address a t least seven days before the date of the sale. oThe notice must indicate when and where the sale will occur and how surplus can be claimed by tenant and what happens to it if not claimed. oThe tenant is entitled to return of the property, upon request, any time before the day of the sale. oThe statute does not set out any procedure for how the landlord must sell the property or what kind, if any, advertising is required. (It is unclear whether Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 33the court would impose some reasonableness standard on the mann er of sale.) oThe landlord may apply the proceeds of sale to unpaid rent, oth er damages, storage fees, and sale costs. oAny surplus must be disbursed to the tenant, upon request, within seven days of the sale. oIf not requested by the tenant w ithin seven days of the sale, t he landlord must give the surplus proceeds to the county government of the county in which the real property is located. If the total value all of the per sonal property left on the pre mises is less than $500 (increased from $100 by the General Assembly in 2012) , the property is considered abandoned five days after execution of a writ of possession. At that time the landlord may throw away or dispose of the property. xIf the tenant requests the prope rty before the expiration of th e five-day period, the landlord must release possession to the tenant during regul ar business hours or at a time agreed upon. If a tenant abandons perso nal property with a total value of $750 or less (increased from $500 by the General Assembly in 2012), or fails to remove such p roperty at the time of execution of a writ of possession , the landlord may immediately remove the property and deliver it to a nonprofit organization that regularly provides free or at a nominal cost clothing and household furni shings to people in need. xThe nonprofit organization must agree to identify and separately store the tenant's property for thirty days. xIt must release the property to the tenant at no charge if the tenant requests release during the thirty-day period. xLandlord must give notice to ten ant of name and address of orga nization to which the tenant's property was delivered by xposting notice at the rented premises xposting notice at the place where the rent is received, and xmailing copy of notice by first-class mail to the tenant's last known address. Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 34RESIDENTIAL LEASES-MOBILE HOME AND CONTENTS. If the tenant rents a mobile hom e space so that the tenant brin gs a mobile home on the landlord's lot, separate rules apply. If the mobile home has a fair market value of $500 or less, the landlord may dispose of the mobile home and its contents as specified in section I above. xThe landlord determines the value of the mobile home. Because a mobile home is a motor vehicle, the landlord must not ify DMV if the landlord wishes to sell the mobile home. The landlord must get permission of the local tax collectors be fore moving the mobile home. If the mobile home has a fair market value of more than $500, the landlord must dispose of the mobile home and contents as provided in G.S. 42-2(e2). oThe mobile home must be titled i n the name of the tenant. If owned by someone else, the landlord cannot acquir e a landlord's lien in the mobi le home. oThe landlord must get a judgment for possession and must have a writ of possession issued to enfo rce the judgment. oAfter the writ has been executed, the landlord may immediately remove the property from the land and store it. oThe landlord must release the mo bile home and contents to the t enant during regular business hours or at a time mutually agreed upon for 21 days after the writ has been executed. oTwenty-one days after writ has b een executed, whether the prope rty remains on the premises or whether the land lord has removed and stored it, landlord has a lien on the property f or the amount of rent due at the time the tenant vacated the premises; for the time up to 60 days from vacating the premises to the date of sale; for physical damages to the property beyond normal wea r and tear; and for reasonable expenses costs and expenses of the sale. xThe landlord must dispose of the property by selling it at a public auction pursuant to G.S. 44A-4. xThe statute requires the landlord to post the notice of sale at the courthouse and to advertise in a newspaper in certain instances. xThe landlord must give notice of the sale to the tenant. xBecause the mobile home is a motor vehicle, the landlord may not sell the mobile home without notifying DM V and getting permission to sel l the vehicle. Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 35xThe purchaser may not move the mobile home without first getting permission from the local tax collector. COMMERCIAL LEASES. The old landlord's possessory lien statute, G.S. 44A-2(e), cont inues to apply commercial leases. Landlord may sell property. oUnder G.S. 44A-2(e) if property has been left on premises for a t least 21 days after tenant vacated premises and landlord has a lawful claim for dam ages against tenant, may sell property. oLien is for amount of rent due a t time tenant vacated and for t he time, up to 60 days, from the vacating of the premise s to the date of sale; for any sums necessary to repair damages to the premises c aused by the tenant, except for normal wear and tear; and for the reasonable cos ts and expenses of selling the personal property. oNotice must be given and property must be sold at public sale u nder provisions of G.S. 44A-4. oIf at any time before the expiration of the 21-day period tenan t requests his property, landlord must turn it over to tenant. oLien does not have priority over any prior perfected security i nterests. Landlord may store property. oUnder G.S. 44A-4(e) landlord may remove tenant's property and store it if left on the premises at least 21 days after the tenant vacates the premises or at least 10 days after the landlord has received a judgment for possession. oProperty placed in storage belongs to the tenant, who is entitl ed to recover it from storage. oIf property stored with person who in ordinary course of business stores property, that person will have a storage lien under G.S. 44A-2(a) and ma y require the tenant to pay the storage costs before releasing the property to him. (If property stored in self-storage facility, owner is entitled to a lien under G.S. 4 4A-41.) Landlord may donate pr operty to charity. oUnder G.S. 44A-2(e) if the total value of all pr operty remaining is less than $100, then any time more than 5 days a fter tenant has vacated or sher iff has padlocked the Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 36premises, landlord may remove th e property and donate it to any charitable organization.

PRACTICAL DIFFERENCES THE RULES DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF SUBSIDY RULE #1: FOUR MOST FREQUENT TYPES OF SUBSIDY: \u0001Public Housing \u0001Tenant-Based (aka Housing Choice/Voucher) \u0001Project-Based \u0001Miscellaneous Rural Development Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 42\u0004\u0003\u0002\u0005\b\u0002\u0004\u0006\u0001 PUBLIC HOUSING Lease termination at any point only for good cause (defined in regulations). Procedural requirements include (1) notice of lease termination with contents specified, including specific factual grounds, and (2) notice term depends on ground for eviction (14 days for nonpayment of rent). TENANT-BASED Termination at end of lease term does not require good cause. Good cause definition differs from public housing definition. No state action involved in eviction by private landlord. Procedure requires written notice specifying grounds (which may be satisfied by complaint if sufficiently detailed) AND notice to PHA. Regulations do not specify notice period. PROJECT-BASED Lease may not be terminated (at any point) unless one of statutory grounds exist. Most frequent ground is \"material non-compliance.\" \"Other good cause\" requires prior notice that violation is basis for termination and terminates only at end of lease term. Law specifies content of notice of termination, including right to meet with landlord, and imposes additional requirements in terms of timing of and service of notice.

Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 44Review Questions on Summary Ejectment 1. T signed a lease for one year. Lease says nothing about notice required to terminate. When the year ended, T continued to occupy the property. LL files for summary ejectment. T defends on ground that LL failed to give notice of termination. Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 2. T had a lease for one year, with rent payable at the first of each month. At the end of the year he remained on the property and continued to pay rent. Six months later, LL filed a summary ejectment action on the ground that T held ov er after the one-year lease. (He's decided he could get more money if he rented to a new T.) Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 3. LL and T have an oral lease agreem ent to rent an apartment on a month-to-month basis for $250/mo nth. T agreed to pay $250 and move in on July 1. He paid for July and August, but on Sept. 1 he failed to pay. On Sept. 2 LL demand ed the rent. On Sept. 5 LL filed a summary ejectment lawsuit. Trial wa s held on Sept 30. LL proved that the Sept rent was due Sept. 1, that he demanded it on Sept. 2, and that it remained unpaid at the time of trial. T offers a check for $250 in court, but LL insists on a judgment. Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 4. LL and T have an oral lease provid ing for month-to-month tenancy, with rent due the first day of the mo nth. T failed to pay rent on Jan. 1. On Jan. 10, LL gives T notice th at he wants to end the lease at the end of the month, telling T she'll have to be out of the rental property by that day. When T remained on the property on Feb. 1 LL filed this action. At trial, T offers a cash pa yment for the Jan. and Feb. rent and court costs. LL insists on a judgme nt. Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 5. LL and T have a written one-year lease requiring payment of $400/month due on the first. The leas e contains a forfeiture clause for failure to pay rent. T failed to pa y rent on May 1, and LL filed an action seeking possession on May 3, seeking possession and back rent. At trial on May 25 T asks you to dismiss the case because LL did not offer any evidence that he demand ed the rent and waited ten days before filing the action. Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 456. Same facts, except that T is no t present at trial and LL asks for judgment on the pleadings. Do yo u grant his request? What legal principle explains your answer? 7. LL has filed a summary ejectment acti on based on holding over at the end of a lease for six months. The lease ended on May 31, and you hear the case on June 15. The monthly rent was $250. At trial LL offers evidence that she has entered into a lease with a new tenant, who was to move in on June 1, at an increased rental rate of $300/month. LL also seeks damages fo r injury to property: she found nicks in the living room wall and the clothesline in the backyard on the ground. She says it will cost $75 to paint the living room and $25 to put up a new clothesline. LL is seeking $300 (rent for June) plus $100 damage to property. T says he moved out on the 10 th, and so should have to pay only $83.33 (10 days, base d on his rent of $250). He also says the clothesline was at least 10 years old and fell down because the metal rusted through. What da mages do you award? State your reasons. 8. LL filed a summary ejectment action on May 31 after T failed to pay rent for May. Trial is held on June 15. LL proves that rent was $350 a month, T failed to pay, and that LL demanded the rent on May 10. Assuming you rule in LL's favor, what is the amount of your judgment? If T came to court and offered te nder as a defense, what amount would be required for an effective tender? 9. T rents a mobile home space from LL. She failed to pay rent on May 1. On May 2 LL demanded the rent, and filed this action on May 15. At trial on June 10, LL proves the te rms of the lease, that rent has not been paid, and that he made demand on the 2 nd. T defends based on the special law requiring 60 days notice in cases involving rental of mobile home spaces. Who wins? Why? 10. LL brings an action for summary ejectment based on failure to pay rent. At trial LL proves that the lease provided for a monthly rental of $550, that she made de mand, and waited 10 days before filing this action. She seeks po ssession, $825 for 1 \u00bd months rent, a late fee of $60 (for 2 months at $30/ month), and an administrative fee of $150 for her inconvenience in havi ng to come to court. Assume that the written lease has a late f ee and administrative fee provision consistent with the amounts she seek s. What damages do you award? 11. LL has filed a summary ejectment action against T for breach of a lease condition (no pets clause, stating that having a pet on the Landlord-Tenant Law - Page 46premises results in an automatic forf eiture of the lease). The one-year lease provides for monthly rent of $4 50. LL testifies that he has seen a cat in T's apartment. He also stat es that T did not pay rent for this month (having been served with th e complaint and summons on the first of the month), and so asks for two weeks back rent. T defends, saying (1) he has no proof she had a cat, (2) she certainly doesn't have a cat now, and (3) she's prepared to tender rent for the entire month in addition to court costs. How do you rule?

In January we were reminded by the North Carolina Supreme Court in In Re J.B. that: 1) We have military personnel living throughout our state, not just in districts with military facilities, and 2) The federal Servicemember's Civil Relief Act, 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 501, et. seq., (SCRA) applies to all non- criminal judicial and administrative proceedings involving service personnel, including domestic and juvenile cases. The Act contains no exception for any civil proceeding. So it covers custody, divorce, support, equitable distribution, 50B and 50C cases, abuse, neglect and dependency proceedings and termination of parental rights. So what does the SCRA Require? First: An Affidavit from Plaintiff If a defendant has not made an appearance, no judgment can be entered until plaintiff files an affidavit stating whether defendant is in the military. 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 521. The term 'judgment' is defined as \"any judgment, decree, order, or ruling, final or temporary.\" 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 511(9). The Act states: \"[T]he court, before entering judgment for the plaintiff, shall require the plaintiff to file with the court an affidavit - (A) Stating whether or not the defendant is in military service and showing necessary facts to support the affidavit; or (B) If the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in military service, stating that the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in military service.\" The Act places responsibility for making sure the Affidavit is filed on the court. For an example of a court form created to help comply with this requirement, see the form adopted in Wake County. If plaintiff's affidavit does not establish that defendant is in the military, the court can proceed with the case. However, the court may require a bond to compensate a defendant later allowed to set aside a judgment because he or she actually was in military service. In addition, the court can enter any other order \"the court determines necessary to protect the rights of the defendant under this Act.\" 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 521(b)(3). Second: Appointment of Attorney for Servicemember If plaintiff's affidavit or other information before the court shows that a defendant who has not made an appearance is in the military, \"the court may not enter judgment until after the court appoints an attorney to represent the defendant.\" 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 521(b)(2). As previously stated, the term 'judgment' is defined by the SCRA to include all orders, including temporary orders. This means the court cannot enter any order - temporary or permanent - before appointing an attorney when defendant has not made an appearance. The SCRA does not define the role of the attorney, but it does require that the attorney attempt to contact the service member and consider requesting a stay of the proceedings. 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 521(d) Third: Stay of Proceedings After counsel has been appointed for a servicemember who has not made an appearance , the court must stay the case for at least 90 days either \"upon motion by the appointed counsel, or on the court's own motion, if the court determines that: 1. There may be a defense to the action and a defense cannot be presented without the presence of the defendant; or 2. After due diligence, counsel has been unable to contact the defendant or otherwise determine if a meritorious defense exists.\" 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 521(d).12/8/2015 On the Civil Side | Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act Applies to Family Cases Too http://civil.sog.unc.edu/servicemembers\u00adcivil\u00adrelief\u00adact\u00adapplies\u00adto\u00adfamily\u00adcases\u00adtoo/ 2/2Cheryl Howell50 U.S.C. app. sec. 521(d). The Act does not define 'stay of proceedings.' The term certainly means the trial court cannot enter final judgment, but does it prohibit the court from entering temporary orders, such as temporary custody or emergency domestic violence protective orders? North Carolina courts have not addressed the issue but at least one state supreme court has held the stay does not mean a court loses jurisdiction to act so it does not prohibit a court from entering temporary orders in custody cases, noting that a child's life does not go into \"suspended animation\" while a service member is on duty. Lenser v. McGowan, 191 S.W.3 506 (Arkansas, 2010). See also N.C. Gen. Stat. 1-75.12(stay pursuant to that statute does not terminate jurisdiction of trial court until 5 years after it is granted). Fourth: When the Servicemember Has Notice of the Proceeding A servicemember who has notice of the proceedings may request a stay pursuant to Section 522 of the Act. The SCRA specifies that a request for a section 522 stay does not constitute an appearance \"for jurisdictional purposes,\" 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 522(c), but does not say that the request does not constitute an appearance for other purposes. This indicates that a servicemember who requests this stay is not entitled to a court-appointed attorney, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 521(b)(2) discussed above, because the request is an appearance. Section 522 provides that, at any stage of the proceeding before final judgment the court may upon its own motion, and shall upon motion of the service member, stay the proceeding for not less than 90 days if: 1. A letter or other communication establishes that a servicemember's military duty requirements materially affect the servicemember's ability to appear and gives a date when the servicemember will be available to appear; and 2. A letter or other communication from the servicemember's commanding officer shows that the servicemember's military duty prevents appearance and that leave is not authorized for the servicemember at the time of the letter. The court is not required to grant the stay unless the court concludes, based on this information provided, that the servicemember's current military duty requirements materially affect the servicemember's ability to appear. If the initial Section 522 stay is granted, a servicemember can request an additional stay \"based on continuing material effect of military duty on the servicemember's ability to appear.\" 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 522(d)(1). In support of the request for additional time, the court must receive letters or communications containing the same information required for the first stay request. If the court refuses the additional time, the court must appoint an attorney for the servicemember before proceeding with the case. 50 U.S.C. app. sec. 522(d)(2). How is the Court-Appointed Attorney Paid? SCRA does not answer this question. This appears to be a wonderful opportunity for pro bono service. There's definitely more to be said about the SCRA, but this covers the basics.

Mental Illness (Minors) a mental condition, other than mental retardation alone, that so impairs the youth's capacity to exercise age- adequate self -control or judgment in the conduct of his activities and social relationships that he is in need of treatment. Substance abuse the pathological use or abuse of alcohol or other drugs in a way or to a degree that produces an impairment in personal, social, or occupational functioning. Substance abuse may include a pattern of tolerance and withdrawal. Dangerous to self Within the relevant past, the individual has: 1.acted in such a way as to show that a.he would be unable, without care, supervision, and the continued assistance of others not otherwise available, to exercise self -control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of his daily responsibilities and social relations, or to satisfy his need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety; and b.there is a reasonable probability of his suffering serious physical debilitation within the near future unless adequate treatment is given. Behavior that is grossly irrational, actions that the individual is unable to control, behavior that is grossly inappropriate to the situation, or other evidence of severely impaired insight and judgment creates an inference that the individual is unable to care for himself; or 2.attempted suicide or threatened suicide and there is a reasonable probability of suicide unless adequate treatment is given; or 3.mutilated himself or attempted to mutilate himself and there is a reasonable probability of serious self- mutilation unless adequate treatment is given. Previous episodes of dangerousness to self, when applicable, may be considered when determining the reasonable probability of serious physical debilitation, suicide, or serious self- mutilation . Dangerous to others Within the relevant past the individual has: 1.inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated, or 2.acted in a way that created a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated, or 3.engaged in extreme destruction of property and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated. Previous episodes of dangerousness to others, when applicable, may be considered when determining the reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct. Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that an individual has committed a homicide in the relevant past is evidence of dangerousness to others.

The physician has checked box number 1 on the petition, which states that the respondent, Martin , is \"mentally ill and dangerous to self of others or mentally ill and in need of treatment in order to prevent further disability and deterioration that would predictably result in dangerousness.\" The facts upon which the physician's opinion is based, according to the petition, are: \"Pa tient behaving in a bizarre manner. Confused. Poor judgment. Unclear if suicidal. \" What do you do? Describe what you do and explain why. 2. Molly lives with her husband and daughter. Her husband report s that Molly has forgotten to turn off the stove t wo times in the last week, resulting in the burning of some pots and pans and a Formica countertop. Molly is extremely forgetful, frequently talks to the wall, and appears to be out of touch with her real surroundings. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (manic -depressive disorder). Is Molly dangerous to herself or others? Why or why not? 3. John goes downtown, hangs out on the main street sidewalk, blocks people from walking by, preaches loud words, and refuses to leave after being directed by the city police. John's brother says that John is religiously preoccupied, has ideas of persecution, and delusions of grandeur. John cannot understand why City Hall will not give him a license. John's brother is afraid that if John persists in trying to convert someone on the street who is resisting John's idea, then this person might become physically aggressive toward John. John's brother does not get any indication that John is aggressively motivated in the sense of being physically violent. John's brother has prepared a petition/affidavit for commitment for the magistrate. John's brother has written down in the petition the facts stated above and added that he believes John is in a mentally ill state of mind , is dangerous to himself or others, and needs medical treatment. Is John dangerous to himself or others? Why or why not? 4. Same facts as in number 3 , except the petitioner adds that John \"assaulted two people yesterday.\" Is John dangerous to himself or others?

She has not attempted to seek other employment and has been living in her car for the past two weeks, despite the cold weather (December ). Jane believes that people are harassing her. Jane's daughter, Mary, was able to get her mother assessed by a physician who diagnosed Jane as suffering from psychotic depression, and possibly paranoid schizophrenia. The doctor also noted to Mary that Jane was not eating well. Since t his initial evaluation two weeks ago, Jane has refused treatment and begun living in her car . Mary reports that her mother seems to have imaginary friends visiting her car, has a flat affect, and believes that others are \"harming her.\" Mary believes that her mother is incapable of providing for herself in her present state and is not getting sufficient nourishment. Mary says that Jane does not appear to have eaten much in the last two weeks and is losing weight. Jane apparently r uns the car engine periodically to keep warm . Mary fears that Jane might die of carbon monoxide poisoning if Jane continues to live in her car the rest of the winter. Is Jane dangerous to herself? Why or why not? 6. Mary has a hammer in the house, breaks everything she can find, and told her husband that if he went to sleep she would bash his brains out. She has threatened to kill her daughter, granddaughter and siste r. The daughter says, \"Upon coming home, I found the TV busted, the telephone had been cut away from the wall, and glass was all over the living room. When I asked what happened, mother became excited and said that she had broken the TV, cut the phone, and broke some of the glass. On the phone the night before, mother had threatened to kill father and aunt.\" Is Mary dangerous to herself? Why or why not? 7. David was found sitting on the edge of a busy airport runway. He had been observed in the woods with a rope around his neck and cutting his arm with a knife.

He threatened to \"bust\" his mother's head if she called anybody. He complained of demons and of feeling that his bones were being pulled out. Is David dangerous? Why or why not?

This order is not an order of commitment but only authorizes the person to be evaluated and treated until a court hearing. The individual making the request has filed a petition with the court for this purpose and is, therefore, called the \"petitioner.\" The individual to be taken into custody for examination will have an opportunity to respond to the petition and is, therefore, called the \"respondent.\" If you are taken into custody, the word \"respondent,\" below, refers to you. 1. A law enforcement officer or other person designated in the custody order must take the respondent into custody within 24 hours. If the respondent cannot be found within 24 hours, a new custody order will be required to take the respondent into custody. Custody is not for the purpose of arrest, but for the respondent's own safety and the safety of others, and to determine if the respondent needs treatment. 2.Without unnecessary delay after assuming custody, the law enforcement officer or other individual designated to provide transportation must take the respondent to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination. 3. The respondent must be examined as soon as possible, and in any event within 24 hours, after being presented for examination. T he examining physician or psychologist will recommend either outpatient commitment, inpatient commitment, substance abuse commitment, or termination of these proceedings. Inpatient commitment : If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for inpatient commitment, the examiner will recommend inpatient commitment. The law enforcement officer or other designated person must take the respondent to a 24 -hour facility. Outpatient commitment: If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment, the examiner will recommend outpatient commitment and identify the proposed outpatient treatment physician or center in the examination report. The person designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the originating county. The respondent must be released from custody. Substance abuse commitment : If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for substance abuse commitment, the examiner must recommend commitment and whether the respondent should be released or held at a 24 -hour facility pending a district court hearing. Depending upon the physician's recommendation, the law enforcement officer or other designated individual will either release the respondent or take him or her to a 24 -hour facility. Termination : If the examiner finds the respondent meets neither of the criteria for commitment, the respondent must be released from custody and the proceedings terminated. If the custody order was based on the finding that the respondent was probably mentally ill, then the person designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the originating county. 4.If the law enforcement officer transports the respondent to a 24 hour facility, another evaluation must be performed within 24 hours of arrival. This evaluator has the same options as indicated in step 3 above. If the respondent is not released, the respondent will be given a hearing before a district court judge within 10 days of the date the respondent was taken into custody.

Brannon What is Involuntary Civil Commitment? Involuntary civil commitment is the process that the state, through its courts, uses to order a person who meets certain statutory cr iteria to obtain mental health treatment. The person ordered to receive treatment is called \"the respondent.\" Civil commitment is involuntary because the re spondent is ordered to submit to mental health treatment without his or her consent. When a respondent is involuntarily committed, the state has substituted its judgment about what is best for the respondent for the respondent's own judgment. This substituted judgment is a significant intrusion on the respondent's right to liberty, as is the involuntary commitment itself. Despite its intrusiveness, the commitment process before 1973 contained ve ry few safeguards to assure that the respondent was not arbitrarily deprived of freedom. Procedural due process was lacking insofar as a person could be committed for twenty days, without notice or a hearing, if a physician certified that the person was mentally ill or inebriate and dangerous to self or others. 1 Substantive due process was lacking in that a respondent could be committed for up to 180 days if, after an informal hearing, the clerk of court found that he or she was mentally ill or inebriate. The respondent did not need to be dangerous to self or others to be committed. 2 In 1973 the process was changed so that no respondent could be taken into custody without a hearing in which a magistrate found that the respondent was either ment ally ill or \"inebriate\" (later changed to The author is a faculty member of the Sc hool of Government.

Th e state must show some dangerousness. \"A state cannot constitutionally confine without more a nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of a willing and responsible family members or friends.\" 4 Parts six, seven and eight of Article 5, Chapter 122C of the North Carolina General Statutes establish the procedures for involu ntary commitment. A brief overview of these procedures is set out below. Description of Commitment Process The statutory procedure for an involuntary commitment involves some or all of the following stages: The Petition for Commitment : A person who has knowledge of someone he or she believes needs mental health or substance abuse treatment petitions the magistrate to begin the involuntary commitment process. 5 (Petitions may also be presented to the clerk of superior court. Although this bulletin will refer to magistrates only, the same law and procedure applies if the petition is presented to a clerk.) This petition is an affidavit setting out facts intended to show that the respondent meets the statutory criteria for issuing an order (called a custody order) to take the respondent into custody for examination by a physician or eligible psychologist. Review of the Petition : The magistrate reviews the petition to determine whether reasonable grounds exist to find that the respondent meets the criteria for a custody order. 6 If the magistrate does not find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets the criteria, the magistrate must decline to issue the order. Custody Order : If the magistrate does find reasonable grounds to conclude that the respondent meets the criteria for a custody order, the magistrate must issue an order to a law enforcemen t officer to take the respondent into custody and transport him or 3.

G.S. 122C-3(27). 11. Inpatient commitment involves holding the respondent in the custody of a facility the state has designated \"24-hour\" facilities. A \"24-hour facility\" is one whose primary purpose is to pr ovide services for the care and treatment of persons who ar e mentally ill or substance abusers and provides a structured living environment and services for a period of 24 consecutive hours or more.

This hearing must occur within 10 days of the date the respondent is taken into custody by order of the magistrate. 16 At the hearing, if the court is persuaded by clear, cogent and convin cing evidence that the respondent meets the commitment criteria, it will order involuntary commitment. 17 The magistrate's role in the involuntary commitment process is a sm all but important one. Magistrates decide whether to issue orders to take respondents into custody for examination. Magistrates do not actually commit anyone; district court judges dete rmine whether to commit. The role of the magistrate as an independent and neutral judicial official determining whether to initiate the process for involuntary commitment is a safeguard to provide due process to a person before depriving that person of liberty as required by the United States Constitution. 18 The rest of this bulletin will focus on the magistrate's role in the process that potentially leads to involuntary commitment. Criteria For Issuing A Custody Order When a person (called the petitioner) appears before a magistrate to initiate the process of involuntary commitment, the magistrate must determine whether there are reasonable grou nds to believe that the respondent meets the statutory criteria for issuing a custody order. Reasonable grounds exist when, taking into consideration all the relevant information, a reasonable person would conclude that there is a fair likelihood that the respondent meets the criteria for a custody order. The \"reasonable commitment); 122C-286(h) (substance abuse commitment). 18. See In re Reed, 39 N.C. App. 227, 249 S.E.2d 864 (1978). standard is synonymous with the probable cause standard that magistrates use in issuing warrants.19 There are three situations in which a magistrate can issue a custody order: 1. The respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self or others. 2. The respondent is mentally ill and needs court-ordered treatment to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness. 3. The respondent is a substance abuser and dangerous to self or others. 20 The first standard, mentally ill and dangerous, is the most complicated of the standards. Mentally Ill and Dangerous to Self or Others Under this standard the magistrate must draw two conclusions from the facts presented before issuing a custody order: first, that the respondent is probably mentally ill; and next, that the respondent is probably dangerous to self or dangerous to others. 21 Mentally Ill An adult respondent is mentally ill when his or her capacity to use self-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of his or her affairs and social relations has been so reduced by an illness that it becomes necessary or advisable for the respondent to be under treatment, care, supervisio n, guidance, or control. 22 A minor respondent is mentally ill when he or she has a mental condition, other than mental retardation alone, that so impairs his or her capacity to exercise age adequate self-control or judgment in the conduct of activities and social relationships that he or she needs treatment. 23 In both cases, the important features of mental illness are: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment and self-control and (3) makes treatment advisable. This is a legal standard, not a medical standard, and therefore does not require that the respondent have been diagnosed with a recognized mental illness by a physician or psychologist. Rather, 19. Id. at 229, 249 S.E.2d at 866. 20. A summary of the standards for involuntary commitment is found at Appendi x I at the end of this bulletin. 21. G.S. 122C-261(b). 22. G.S. 122C-3(21)(i). 23. 29Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 4 the magistrate must listen for facts that show that the respondent needs treatment because of a mental condition that is impairing his or her ability to make judgments or exercise self-control. In determining whether there are reasonable grounds to find that the respondent is mentally ill, a magistrate should look for conduct that is on the extreme ends of behaviors. Of course every person can, at times, engage in behavior that might be called extreme: a person can be so hostile that he slams the door in someone's face or so agitated that she drives off from the store with the grocery bags on top of her car. But in a respondent who is mentally ill, this behavior should go one step further: hostility may be taken to the point of attacking someone or anxiety may be manifested by a complete inability to carry on with the other functions of daily life. Also the extreme behavior is continuing rather than a one-time occurrence. The magistrate must examine the information provided about the respondent's behavior, movements, speech, motions and thoughts. For example, is the responden t seeing things that are not really there? Is the respondent in constant motion or is he totally quiet and apathetic? Appendix II at the end of this bulletin gives examples of the kinds of extreme behaviors that might indicate mental illness. If a magistrate determines that the respondent is probably mentally ill, the next step is to determine whether the respondent is probably dangerous to self or others. Dangerous to Self A petitioner can show that the respondent is dangerous to self in three different ways: Respondent is unable to care for himself or herself, is suicidal, or has engaged in self-mutilation. Respondent is unable to care for self The first way of proving dangerousness is by showing that, within the relevant past, the respondent has been unable to care for himself or herself and as a result is likely to suffer serious physical debilitation in the near future if treatment is not given. 24 Magistrates should note that although the appellate cases cited in this bulletin are instructive, they are based on evidence presented at the district court hearing where the standard of proof\u2014clear, cogent, and convincing evidence\u2014is significantly higher than the reasonable ground s determination that the magistrate must make. The requirement that the behavior have occurred within the \"relevant past\" 24. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.1. does not mean that the behavior must have occurred within the \"recent past.\" There is no specific time within which the past behavior must have occurred to be relevant. (The concept of \"relevant past\" is discussed more thoroughly below at page 7.) The test for finding that the respondent is unable to care for self has two prongs and both must be satisfied before issuing a custody order. First, the magistrate must determine that the respondent has acted in such a way as to show that he or she probably would be unable, without care, supervision, and the continued assistance of others not otherwise available, to exercise se lf-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of daily responsibilities and social relations, or to satisfy the need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety. Put more simply, the first prong requires the magistrate to find that the respondent probably would be unable to care for himself or herself in regard to daily affairs without treatment. For example, a respondent, who required anti-psychotic medication but refused to take it, would not eat properly, and refused recommended outpatient treatment was found dangerous to himself. Failure to care for medi cal, dietary, and grooming needs meets the test of dangerousness to self, the court said. 25 On the other hand, unusual eating habits alone may not show dangerousness to self. The North Carolina Court of Appeals was hesitant to find that a respondent who fasted for a time, then ate a whole chicken or loaf of bread, and also ate about five pounds of sugar every two days was dangerous to himself. 26 If the respondent seems unable to care for his or her daily needs, the magistrate must go on to make a second, more specific, finding that this inability to care for self creates a probability that the respondent will suffer serious physical debilitation within the near future. In the example above, where the respondent's dietary habits were irregular, the court noted that it could not find a likelihood of serious debilitation because the state had presented no evidence of the effect of the irregular diet on the respondent, or any evidence on how long he had been eating that way. 27 The result might have been different if the respondent was diabetic. On the other 25. In re Lowery, 110 N.C. App. 67, 428 S.E.2d 861 (1993). 26. In re Monroe, 49 N.C. App. 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980). The decision was an appeal from the district court's commitment so the standard of proof that was not met was clear, cogent and convincing rather than the magistrate's standard of reasonable grounds. 27. Id. at 29, 270 S.E.2d at 540. IVC - Page 30September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 5 hand, where a petitioner presented evidence that the respondent had been living in her car for two weeks during the winter, had been unemployed for the last year, having left her job because she felt she was being harassed, and had no plans for earning income, and that her only means of subsistence was food brought by the petitioner, the court found that the respondent was at risk of serious physical debilitation. 28 In determining the reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct, the magistrate may consider previous episodes of dangerousness to self.29 If the petitioner presents evidence that the respondent's behavior is grossly irrational, that the respondent is unable to control his or her actions, that the respondent's behavior is grossly inappropriate to the situation, or that the respondent's insight and judgment are severely impaired, the magistrate may presume that the respondent probably meets this second prong. 30 To summarize, a magistrate may find a respondent dangerous to self if the respondent seems unable to take care of his or her daily needs and is likely to suffer serious physical debilitation in the near future if he or she does not receive treatment. However, the respondent cannot be found dangerous to self merely because he or she behaves in a way that may provoke others to harm him or her. For example, a respondent who was not physically violent herself, but who aggressively preached on the street corner, trying to convert all passersby, was not dangerous to herself merely because someone who reacted negatively to her conversion attempt might react in a way that is physically harmful to her. 31 Respondent is suicidal A respondent also can be dangerous to self if he or she has attempted or threatened suicide and there is a reasonable probability of suicide unless the respondent receives adequate treatment. 32 The magistrate may choose to treat an attempt at suicide, alone, as sufficient evidence that there is a reasonable probability of suicide. The magistrate also may treat a threat of suicide as grounds for issuing a custody order and leave the determination of whether there is 28. In re Medlin, 59 N.C. App. 33, 295 S.E.2d 604 (1982). The finding that the respondent was mentally ill was not disputed. 29. G.S 122C-3(11)a. 30. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.1.II. 31. In re Hogan, 32 N.C. App. 429, 232 S.E.2d 492 (1977). 32. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.2. a future likelihood of suicide to the examiners. Whether a statement constitutes a threat of suicide will depend on the respondent's history and the context in which the statement was made: for example, a statement like \"I could kill myself\" probably is not a threat of suicide when it comes from a person who has just done something enormously embarrassing, but it may be when it comes from someone who has suffered a dramatic loss of some kind. Respondent has engaged in self-mutilation The third way to show a respondent is dangerous to self is to prove that he or she has mutilated or attempted to mutilate himself or herself and that serious mutilation is likely to occur again unless the respondent is committed. 33 No North Carolina appellate cases have discussed this ground for commitment. Self-harm or self-injurious behavior is fairly prevalent today, 34 particularly among adolescents and may include burning, biting, cutting, head banging, picking at skin, pulling out hair, bruising. But some self-harm, while needing treatment, does not rise to the level of self-mutilation necessary for involuntar y commitment, and the magistrate must be careful to distinguish between the two. The involuntary commitment statute requires that the magistrate find that serious self-mutilation is likely to occur unless the respondent is committed. Therefore, the frequency and the severity or seriousness of the injury is critical. The magistrate should also look at other factors such as the reason for the self-harm, whether the respondent has access to weapons to do serious harm, and the progression of seriousness of the injuries. One case from another state in which the facts show ed dangerousness to self based on self-mutilative behavior indicated that the patient had a history of cutting himself, injuring 33. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.3. 34. About one percent of th e United States population uses physical self-injury as a way of dealing with overwhelming feelings or situ ations, but the problem is more prevalent among teenagers where an estimated ten percent have experimented with self-mutilation.

IVC - Page 31Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 6 himself very seriously to the point that he required blood transfusions.35 Dangerous to Others A magistrate must also i ssue a custody order for a mentally ill respondent if he or she is dangerous to others. A respondent is dangerous to others if, within the relevant past, he or she has: (1) inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another, or has acted in a way that creates a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another, or has engaged in extreme destruction of property, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will be repeated. 36 Respondent has inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another Most cases coming before a magistrate probably will be fairly clear cut as to whether the respondent inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another person. But what if the respondent has only threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another? Is the threat a sufficient basis for finding that the respondent is dangerous to others? Courts addressing the issue have concluded that overt dangerous actions are not necessary to conclude that a respondent is dangerous to others. For example, a respondent who threatened his aged and nervous mother and family with increasing frequency over several weeks, saying he was going to \"get you all,\" in conjunction with evidence that he believed his family had sexually seduced him and that he appeared ready to fight any time one of them said something to him, led the court to conclude that the respondent was dangerous to others. 37 In another case, a respondent was found dangerous to others based on evidence that he kept an iron pipe and hatchet under his bed and, through threats, had kept his mother in one chair, unmoving, while he screamed, shouted, cursed, and threatened to \"bust\" her head if she called anybody. 38 A respondent who had threatened many people in the neighborhood and 35. In re Best Interest of M.G. 2002 WL 31854887 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2002) 36. G.S. 122C-3(11)(b). 37. In re Monroe, 49 N.C. App. 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980). 38. In re Collins, 49 N.C. App. 243, 271 S.E.2d 72 (1980). had threatened to cut her brother's throat was found dangerous to others.39 In order to find a respondent dangerous to others on the basis of threats alone, however, the petitioner must present specific evidence about the kind of harm the respondent threatened, when the threats were made, and in what context. For example, the mere allegation that the \"respondent ha[d] made statements to her husband of a threatening nature,\" without more, is insufficient. 40 One issue that sometimes troubles magistrates is commitment of persons who are residing in nursing homes. For example, a resident of the nursing home who suffers from dementia or bipolar disorder becomes violent and attacks another resident of the nursing home and the nursing home staff seeks to have the resident involuntarily committed. The fact that the respondent is in a nursing home or the fact that the respondent suffers from dementia should not result in any different decision by the magistrate. If the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to believe the respondent is mentally ill (i.e., has an illness\u2014and dementia and Alzheimer's disease are mental illnesses--that impairs judgment and self-control and makes treatment advisable) and is dangerous to self or others, the magistrate should issue a custody order. Respondent's behavior creates a substantial risk of serious harm There are no reported North Carolina cases that have addressed a respondent whose actions, though not intended to inflict serious bodily harm on another, have nonetheless created a substantial risk of serious harm. Some situations, of course, will be clear cut: if the respondent, while playing with matches, sets fire to an occupied twenty-unit apartment building in the middle of the night, the respondent's behavior creates a substantial risk of serious harm. Other cases will require a judgment call: if the respondent has a habit of digging man-sized holes in a field near his house, whether or not such conduct creates a substantial risk of serious harm depends on the depth of the holes, the amount of pedestrian traffic in the field, and the visibility of the holes to pedestrians who do walk in the field. If the field sees significant pedestrian traffic, and the respondent artfully covers the holes 39. In re Jackson, 60 N.C. App. 581, 299 S.E.2d 677 (1983). This respondent had also cut her brother's hand within the last week, but the court did not discuss the seriousness of this cut or its role in the determination that she was dangerous to others. 40. In re Holt, 54 N.C. App. 352, 354, 283 S.E.2d 413, 415 (1981). IVC - Page 32September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 7 with grass, the holes may create a substantial risk, but if the holes are only two inches deep, they may not create a risk of serious physical harm. Respondent has engaged in extreme destruction of property The one reported case in No rth Carolina dealing with dangerousness to others based on engaging in extreme destruction of property emphasized the \"extreme\" requirement. In that case the respondent had used a hammer to break everything she could find in her house, including the television, the telephone, and all available glass. 41 Reasonable probability of dangerous behavior being repeated Unlike the second prong of the dangerousness to self test, the second prong of the dangerousness to others test\u2014a reasonable probability that the dangerous behavior will be repeated\u2014has not been emphasized in court cases. The stat ute provides that the magistrate may consider previous episodes of dangerous behavior in determining future probability of dangerous conduct. 42 Therefore, as long as the magistrate finds past acts of dangerousness this prong is satisfied. Within the relevant past The tests for dangerousness to self and others share the requirement that the respondent's allegedly dangerous behavior has occurred within the relevant past. This requirement is no different than the requirement of relevance in evidence law, generally. That is, any information that tends to make the existence of a material f act more or less likely is relevant. 43 In the context of involuntary commitment, the respondent's behavior occurred within the relevant past if the behavior makes it more or less likely that the respondent is dangerous to self or others at the time commitment is considered. \"[The] acts are relevant because they occurred close enough in time to the district court [or magistrate's] hearing to have probative value on the ultimate question before the court of whether there was a 'reasonable probability that such [violent] conduct [would] be 41. In re Williamson, 36 N.C. App. 362, 244 S.E.2d 189 (1978). There was also evidence that the respondent threatened to physically injure family members. 42. G.S. 122C-3(11)b. 43. G.S. 8C-1, Rule 401. repeated.'\"44 So, for example, if the petitioner presents information that the mentally ill respondent, now thirty years old, went through a period when she was ten where she would only eat dirt, the behavior probably did not occur within the relevant past. The concept of within the relevant past does not depend solely on the passage of time, however, but on the totality of the circumstances as the petitioner presents them. For example, the petitioner presents evidence that the mentally ill respondent tried to kill his brother three years ago after refusing to take medication prescribed for his mental illness. This information may seem remote in time. However, if the petitioner supplements this evidence with the information that the mentally ill respondent has once again stopped taking his prescription medication and is exhibiting symptoms similar to those that preceded the three-year-old incide nt, that three-year-old evidence may have occurred within the relevant past. Although most information the magistrate hears will probably not be this remote, the important thing to remember is that there is no bright-line in time beyond which information is no longer relevant. In fact, one of the problems the General Assembly wanted to cure in changing the language of the standard from \"within the recent past\" to \"within the relevant past\" was the practice of some judicial officials of setting a specific limit on the time frame for the conduct. 45 Summary The magistrate must issue a custody order when he or she finds reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent is probably mentally ill and dangerous to self or others. Mental illness has three elements: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment and self-control (3) to a degree that makes treatment or supervision advisable. A respondent is dangerousness to self if he or she: (1) is unable to care for self and there is a reasonable probability of serious physical debilitation in the near future or (2) has attempted or threatened suicide and there is a reasonable probability of suicide or 44.

A respondent is dangerous to others if (1) he or she has: (a) inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another or (b) acted in a way that creates a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another or (c) engaged in extreme destruction of property and (2) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will be repeated. Mentally Ill and in Need of Treatment Even if a mentally ill respondent is not dangerous to self or others, a magistrate still must issue a custody order if the respondent, based on his or her psychiatric history, is in need of treatment to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness.46 Mental illness in this context means the same thing as mental illness in the inpatient commitment context: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment and self-control (3) to the extent that treatment or supervision is advisable. Although this standard (unlike the mentally ill and dangerous to self or others standard) does not specifically require the petitioner to show that within the relevant past the respondent has engaged in, attempted, or threatened to engage in conduct that is dangerous to self or others, such evidence seems necessary to show a psychiatric history indicating that deterioration leading to dangerousness is likely. That is, psychiatric history that would make dangerous deterioration predictable is bound to be a history of past instances in which the respondent did become dangerous. For example, if the petitioner presents evidence that the respondent has stopped taking her antipsychotic medication and states that the lack of medication will make the respondent dangerous, this statement alone probably is not sufficient grounds to issue a custody order: it should be supported by information that when the respondent has gone off her medication in the past she has done, attempted, or threatened to do, something dangerous. Involuntary Commitment of Mentally Retarded Respondents 46. G.S. 122C-261(b). Special rules apply in issuing custody orders for mentally ill persons who are also mentally retarded. A mentally retarded respondent may be involuntarily committed only if he or she meets one of the standards set out above; that is, the respondent must be mentally ill and dangerous to self or others or must be mentally ill and in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness. 47 It is often difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the dangerous behavior is caused by the mental retardation or mental illness, If the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to believe the respondent is mentally ill as well as mentally retarded and if the magistrate finds dangerousness to self or others, the magistrate should issue the commitment or der and leave it to the professionals to determine whether involuntary commitment is appropriat e for the respondent. Moreover, a mentally retarded person cannot be admitted to a state psychiatric hospital unless the respondent is so extremely dangerous as to pose a serious threat to the community and to other patients in a non-state hospital or is so gravely disabled by both multiple disorders and medical fragility or deafness that alternative care is inappropri ate. In both of those situations the determination of whether the respondent meets the criteria for commitment to a state psychiatric hospital is made by the Local Management Entity for the area where the respondent resides or is found. 48 If a respondent is mentally retarded, the petitioner must produce facts indicating this on the petition, and the magistrate must specifically note it on the custody order. \"Mental retardation\" is defined as \"significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested before age 22.\" 49 Making such a diagnosis is beyond the knowledge of lay petitioners and magistrates alike and should be left to the professional examiner. However, the petition must 47. G.S. 122C-261(b). In Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178 (W.D.N.C. 1988) a federal district court held that North Carolina was inappropriately confining and treating mentally ill retarded persons in the state psychiatric hospitals and ordered the state to provide a full range of habilitative treatment for mentally retarded persons confined in state psychiatric hospitals. The requirement limiting admission to state hospitals was enacted in 1995 in response to that case. See Joan Brannon, 1996 Legislation Amending the Involuntary Commitment and Domestic Violence Laws, A DMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE MEMORANDUM No. 96/04 at 1. 48. G.S. 122C-261(f). 49. G.S. 122C-3(22) (1996). IVC - Page 34September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 9 include facts indicating me ntal retardation. Four questions can help a magistrate determine whether the respondent is probably mentally retarded: (1) Has a doctor or psychologist ever said that the respondent has mental retardation? (2) Has the respondent ever been in special education classes for st udents with mental retardation? (3) Has the respondent ever received special services for respondents with mental retardation such as sheltered workshops or group home placement? (4) Did the problems relating to intelligence and functioning begin before age 22? In order to find the respondent mentally retarded, the answer to the fourth ques tion must be \"yes\" and at least one of the other three questions must also be answered in the affirmative.50 The special provisions regarding mentally retarded persons do not apply to substance abuse commitments. Substance Abuse Commitment Magistrates may also be asked to issue custody orders for respondents who are substance abusers. The standard for issuing a custody order in these circumstances is: (1) the respondent is a substance abuser who is (2) dangerous to self or others.51 Substance abuse means the pa thological use or abuse of alcohol or other drugs in a way, or to a degree, that produces an impairment in personal, social, or occupational functioning; it may include a pattern of tolerance and withdrawal. 52 The use does not need to have occurred over any certain length of time or in any certain amount. To be pathological the use need only be habitual or compulsive and have a negative impact on the respondent's functioning. Such functional impairment might mean, for example, that the respondent misses important meetings at work because of alcohol or drugs, verbally abuses friends and family members when drunk, or suffers delusions when she has gone too long without drugs or alcohol. A magistrate who finds that the respondent is probably a substance abuser and is dangerous to self or others must issue a custody order. The standard for assessing danger to self or others is the same as described under the standard for inpatient commitment of persons with mental illness. 50. Brannon, supra note 47 at 2-3. 51. G.S. 122C-281. 52. G.S. 122C-3(36). Unlike the definition of mental illness, this definition is a medical one. Procedure for Initiating Involuntary Commitment To begin the process of involuntary commitment a person must petition for an order (the custody order) to have the respondent picked up for examination by a physician. Petitioning for a custody order differs in several significant ways from the usual small claims court procedure. First of a ll, the procedure is not a trial; it is merely a mechanism to have the respondent taken into custody for examination. Petitioning for a custody order is an ex parte hearing: that is, the hearing takes place without notice to, or the presence of, the opposing party\u2014in this case, the respondent. The respondent normally is not present, but even if respondent is present, the usual procedure for presentation of evidence is not followed. The respondent is not part of the process and does not present evidence in his or her favor or get to cross examine the petitioner or petitioner's witnesses. Also, two fundamental rules of evidence are not followed in petitioning for involuntary commitment. First, the petitioner is deemed a competent witness even in cases where he or she has no personal, firsthand, knowledge of the respondent's state. This departure from the rules of evidence leads to the second, which is that a petitioner can prove his or her case, and the respondent may be taken into custody and transported for examination, entirely on the basis of hearsay evidence. 53 In this last respect, hearing a petition for a custody order is like the probable cause determination in issuing criminal process. Who may initiate a petition? Anyone with information about the respondent may petition for a custody order..54 The respondent's family members or friends, neighbors, social workers, teachers, physicians or law enforcement officers can all be petitioners. The petitioner's knowledge of the respondent's condition does not have to be firsthand; hearsay information about the respondent is acceptable. For example, a law enforcement officer may petition for a custody order on the basis of information told to him or her by the respondent's neighbor, or a respondent's sister may petition based on information from the respondent's mother. In this respect, the petition resembles an application for a warrant: hearsay evidence can be considered, but at the trial of the matter before a 53. In re Zollicoffer, 165 N.C. App. 462, 598 S.E.2d 696 (2004). 54. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). IVC - Page 35Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 10 district court, the witness must have personal knowledge of the facts a bout which he or she is testifying. Who is subject to a custody order? Any person may be subject to a custody order (assuming the petitioner presents sufficient evidence), no matter his or her age. Involuntary commitment of minor children may occur less frequently than of adults because parents (or guardians) are given the power to consent to treatment for their minor children and can have them admitted to treatment without showing dangerousness. Involuntary commitment thus generally occurs only when a child's parents do not consent to treatment, the parents cannot be found, or because of the child's dangerousness, the parents believe it is best to involuntarily commit the child. However, if the petitioner presents sufficient facts to commit a minor, the magistrate cannot refuse to issue a custody order for a minor simply because the parent could seek a voluntary admission. Where is the petition initiated? Petitions may be made to a magistrate in the county where the respondent lives or in the county where the respondent is found. 55 For example, if a resident of Cabarrus County is found wandering the streets of downtown Charlotte without proper clothing, speaking to imaginary friends, either a magistrate in Cabarrus County or a magistrate in Mecklenburg County is authorized to issue a custody order for the respondent and the petitioner can go to either place. Most often the petition is brought in the county where the respondent is found. A respondent who is found in North Carolina need not be a resident of the state to be involuntarily committed. A Mecklenburg County magistrate could also issue a custody order for a resident of South Carolina who is found in Mecklenburg County. 56 How is a petition made? 55. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 56. If a resident of anot her state is involuntarily committed in North Carolina, the State psychiatric hospital may return the respondent to his or her home state. G.S. 122C-345. Personal Appearance Most petitioners must appear personally before the magistrate to execute the petition.57 The magistrate may have the petitioner fill out the petition or may complete it for the petitioner after the petitioner has conveyed the relevant facts about the respondent's condition. Either way, the petitioner must swear to the facts contained in the petition. An unsworn petition cannot serve as the basis for issuance of a custody order. 58 Physician or Psychologist Petitioner One group of petitioners does not have to personally appear before the magistrate: when the petitioner is a physician or eligible psychologist59 who has examined the respondent, he or she may execute an affidavit before any official authorized to administer oaths (usually a notary public) and submit the affidavit to the magistrate by delivering the original to the magistrate or sending a copy by telefacsimile transmission.60 The physician or psychologist examiner need not appear before the magistrate to testify, but the magistrate must have the notarized affidavit or a faxed copy of it in front of him or her and make a determination from the facts contained in the affidavit that the resp ondent meets the custody order criteria. Because the physician's or psychologist's evaluation must comply with the requirements of an initial examination, the physician or psychologist petitioner frequently will attach a form called \"Examination and Recommendation to Determine the Necessity for Involuntary 57. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 58. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985). 59. There is a pilot progr am operating in several western Local Management Entities (LMEs) allowing the initial evaluation to be performed by a licensed clinical social worker, a masters level psychiatric nurse or a masters level certified addictions specialist in addition to a physician or eligible psychologist. In those LMEs when these clinicians perform the initial evaluation, they are treated like physicians and eligible psychologists and do not have to personally appear before the magistrate when they are the petitioner. 60. G.S. 122C-261(d). A similar provision for transmission by telefacsimile is not included in the substance abuse statute. However, since the procedure could be followed without a statutory provision, it can be followed in substance abuse commitments also. IVC - Page 36September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 11 Commitment\"61 to the affidavit and the facts may be stated in the attachment. If the affidavit is submitted by telefacsimile transmission, the physician or psychologist must mail the original no later than five days after transmission to the clerk or magistrate to be filed in the case file. Sometimes rather than mailing the original, the physician or psychologist will give it to the law enforcement officer who comes to the physician or psychologist to take the respondent into custody under the order. Petition Must Show Facts The \"Affidavit and Petition for Involuntary Commitment\" (AOC-SP-300) is a sworn affidavit setting forth facts that show that the respondent meets at least one of the standard s for issuance of a custody order. The magistrate must issue a custody order if the petition shows that the respondent is probably: (1) mentally ill and dangerous to self or others; (2) mentally ill and in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness; or (3) a substance abuser who is dangerous to self or others. The petition must set forth facts in support of petitioner's allegations and not just conclusions. Facts are assertions or statements about something having objective reality\u2014an actual event in time or space. Conclusions are judgments. Statements in a petition such as \"the respondent lacks self-control and is unable to provide for himself\" or \"the respondent is a mentally ill ... person who is dangerous to [her]self or others [and] [r]espondent has strange behavior and irrational in her thinking\" 62 are conclusions. An example of a statement of facts is: \"For the past two weeks the respondent has been hallucinating, claiming that an escaped convict is after him and that his wife is secretly keeping the convict in the basement of their home. On three occasions between April 23 and 25 he threatened to shoot his wife if she does not get rid of the convict. On April 26, the respondent purchased a gun, shot his wife in the arm, and told her that she had three days to get the convict out of the house.\" The facts stated in the petition must support all the criteria necessary for a custody order. The statement of facts above, for example, establishes that the respondent is probably mentally ill (hallucinating, claiming that an escaped convict is conspiring with his wife), that he inflicted serious physical harm on someone (shot his wife), and that there is a likelihood 61. The form number is DMH 5-72-01 (Sept. 2001). 62. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App. 579, 581, 328 S.E.2d 588, 589 (1985). such conduct will be repeated (past behavior and still hallucinating indicates conduct likely to reoccur); this statement of facts supports a finding that the respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to others. But recall the example of the mentally ill respondent who fasted for days at a time and then ate a whole loaf of bread or a chicken, and ate five pounds of sugar every two days. While this statement of facts may have supported a finding that the respondent was unable to care for himself, it did not show that he was in danger of serious physical debilitation, as required to find the respondent mentally ill and dangerous to himself. The following petition also was found to be insufficient to allege mental illness and dangerous to self: \"Respondent has strange behavior and irrational in her thinking. Leaves home and no one knows of her whereabouts, and at tim es spends the night away from home. Accuses her husband of improprieties.\" 63 An example of a sufficient petition based on respondent's danger to self is: \"Respondent stopped taking her psychiatric medicine (Haldol) three weeks ago. She has begun having trouble sleeping at night and hasn't slept more than one hour in the past 48 hours. She hasn't bathed for a week and has been talking constantly for the last week even though normally she is a quiet person. Last night when it was 25 degrees outside, I found her walking around in the back yard in a short-sleeved shirt saying she was looking for her mother, who died fifteen years ago.\" A petition adequate to obtain a custody order for a substance abuser might be the following: \"The respondent has been smoking crack cocaine three times daily for the last two weeks; he lost his job two days ago when he showed up at work high and now that he has no income of his own to buy drugs today he beat his mother and fath er to steal their money.\" When a respondent is mentally retarded as well as mentally ill, the petition might allege (in addition to facts necessary to support the other required elements for commitment) something to the effect that the respondent was identified as mentally retarded when she was in second grade and has been receiving special education services for the mentally retarded since that time. It is not clear whether it is necessary to allege facts regarding the mental retardation since that is not a criteria for commitment, but rather a special provision that affects the choice of hospitals for the respondent. However, since the statute requires the magistrate to find that \"the respondent is also probably mentally ill\" 64 the safest practice is to include facts supporting that finding. 63. Id. 64. G.S. 122C-261(b). IVC - Page 37Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 12 Magistrate's Role in Ascertaining Facts Asking Questions A petitioner who appears before a magistrate seeking a custody order is often in a state of crisis. Due to this emotional state and the fact that the petitioner is probably not acquainted with the custody order criteria, the magistrate may have to actively participate in getting information from the petitioner and in writing the petition. The magistrate should always feel free to ask specific questions necessary to determine whether to issue a custody order. Common questions to ask might include: 1. Has the respondent harmed or threatened to harm self or others within the past 24 hours? Within the last week? Month? Three months? a. What did the respondent do to himself or herself? b. What did the respondent do to you? c. What did the respondent do to others? 2. Is the respondent hallucinating (seeing or hearing things that other people don't)? What kind of things is he or she hearing or seeing? 3. Can the respondent identify the day, where he or she is, his or her name or age? 4. Does the respondent have unreasonable thoughts that people are talking about him or her or are going to kill or hurt him or her? Tell me what he or she said, or how you learned this information?. 5. Is the respondent making exaggerated or elaborate claims, such as: a. being on a special mission; b. being another important and powerful person; c. being part of a powerful organization? 6. Does the respondent have trouble sleeping at night? How long since the respondent had a normal night's sleep? 7. Has the respondent consumed more than one pint of alcohol per day for the past three to ten days? 8. Is the respondent taking any medication? a. what is it? b. has the respondent taken any illegal drugs within the past 24 hours? Month? Three months? What kind of drug? How much? 9. Has there been any change in the respondent's appetite? Has it grown or decreased? Is the respondent eating at all? 10. Is the respondent doing his or her normal activities? If not, what is the respondent doing differently? 11. Is the respondent unable to care for self because of his or her mental condition? Is he or she eating, sleeping, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, staying out of traffic? Writing Down All the Relevant Facts The magistrate must make sure that the petition itself contains all the facts about a respondent's present condition as well as information about previous episodes of dangerousness that are relevant to determining that there is a reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct or that would show the current deterioration would predictably result in dangerousness if treatment is not provided. 65 The facts must support all the bases for commitment that are checked on the order. For example, if the respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self, the facts must support each of these prongs. If there is not enough space for this information on the petition itself, the magistrate should attach an extra sheet. Full detail is important for two reasons: First, the district court judge is likely to dismiss the case if the petition is lacking in detail to support a custody order. 66 \"[A custody] order is essentially a judgment by which a person is deprived of his liberty ..., and as a result, he is entitled to the safeguard of a determination by a neutral officer of the court that reasonable grounds exist for his original detention....\" 67 Even if the petitioner is a physician or psychologist, the petition must state sufficient facts to support the issuance of a custody order. Giving too much deference to physicians or psychologists, who are required to give facts like other petitioners, may result in the case being dismissed and is an abdication of the magistrate's role as an independent judicial official determining reasonable grounds to proceed. 65. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 66. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App. 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985). 67. In re Reed, 39 N.C. App. 227, 229, 249 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1978). IVC - Page 38September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 13 Second, because the physician or psychologist who examines the respondent may not speak to anyone besides the respondent, the petition must convey to the examiner the respondent's current state and past history. Denying The Custody Order If, after hearing the petitioner, the magistrate does not find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets one of the custody order standards, the magistrate must not issue a custody order. In this circumstance, the magistrate does not have to fill out a petition (in those cases where the petitioner has not filled out his or her own petition) and is not required to make written findings of fact. The magistrate should give the petitioner the information necessary to contact the local mental health center and pursue whatever treatment options the respondent will voluntarily accept. Issuing The Custody Order A magistrate who does find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets one of the custody order standards must issue a custody order. Where the statutory criteria for is suing a custody order are met, the magistrate should issue a custody order even if the respondent, either in person or via the petitioner, agrees to submit to treatment voluntarily. The reason for this result is this: it is possible that the respondent, because of mental illness or substance abuse, may not have the capacity to consent to treatment. Whether the capacity to consent does exist is a determination that should be left to the professional examiner and, if the respondent has capacity to consent, the examiner may convert the involuntary commitment to a voluntary admission. In a case from Florida the respondent agreed to hospitalization but later claimed that he was deprived of his liberty without due process because he didn't have the mental capacity to understand his consent. He successfully claimed that the hospitalization should have occurred under the involuntary commitment process where he would have been afforded the due process safe guards inherent in that procedure. 68 The bottom line is that if a respondent meets the custody order criteria, the magistrate should issue the order. 68. Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed. 2d 100 (1990). The kind of order the magistrate issues will depend on who the petitioner is. When the Petitioner is Not a Physician or Psychologist When the petitioner is not a physician or eligible psychologist, the magistrate will use the form entitled \"Findings and Custody Order Involuntary Commitment\" (AOC-SP-302). Findings In issuing the order itself the magistrate must first make \"findings\" of fact. The order contains three possible findings: (1) the respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self or others or in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness; (2) the respondent, in addition to being mentally ill, is also mentally retarded; or (3) the respondent is a substance abuser and dangerous to self or others. The magistrate should check all that apply, and it is possible that all three could apply. The magistrate, however, may only check the mental retardation box [box (2)] if the respondent is also mentally ill and that box was also checked. If the respondent is a substance abuser and also mentally retarded, there is no similar requirement to make findings concerning mental retardation. Order Under the order the magistrate should check the block that directs \"any law enforcement officer\" to take the respondent into custody and take the respondent for examination by a person authorized by law to conduct the examina tion (block 1). The officer must take the respondent to an area facility 69 for examination; if a proper person to perform the examination is not available in the area facility or no facility is available, the officer takes the respondent to any physician or psychologist locally available, 70 which typically is the emergency department of the nearest general hospital. If the initial examiner recommends inpatient commitment, the order directs a law enforcement officer to transport the respondent to a designated 24-hour facility for a second examination. 69. An \"area facility\" is a facility operated by or under contract with an area mental health authority. G.S. 122C- 3(14). 70. G.S. Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 14 When the Petitioner is a Physician or Psychologist When the petitioner is a physician or psychologist71 who has already examined the respondent and has made a specific recommendation as to the respondent's disposition and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds supporting the recommendation, then the order the magistrate issues depends on the examiner's recommendation for disposition, which is found in Section III of \"Examination and Recommendation to Determine Necessity for Involuntary Commitment\" (DMH 5-72-01). If the examination form is not attached and the physician has not specified the type of commitment\u2014mentally ill and dangerous; mentally ill and in need of treatment; or substance abuser and dangerous\u2014the magistrate must determine which type of commitment the facts support. When the physician or psychologist recommends inpatient commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends inpatient commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm that recommendation, the magistrate must issue the regular custody order (AOC-SP-302), make the appropriate finding, and ch eck the box in the order directing the law enforcement officer to transport the respondent directly to a designated 24-hour facility for examination and custody pending a district court hearing (box 2). 72 There is no need to take the respondent to a local examiner because the physician or psychologist petitioner has already performed that examination. When the physician or psychologist recommends outpatient commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends outpatient commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm the recommendation, the magistrate does not issue a custody order because th e respondent will not be taken into custody. Rather, the magistrate issues the order entitled \"Findings and Order Involuntary Commitment Physician-Petitioner Recommends Outpatient Commitment\" (AOC-SP-305), which requires hearing a district court judge to hold a hearing to determine whether the respondent will be 71. See supra note 59. 72. G.S. 122C-261(d). involuntarily committed to outpatient treatment.73 The clerk will issue a notice of hearing to the respondent.74 Outpatient commitment means treatment in an outpatient setting and may include medication, individual or group therapy, day or partial day programming activities, services and training including educational and vocational activities, supervision or living arrangements, and any other services prescribed either to alleviate the individual's illness or disability, maintain semi-independent functioning, or to prevent further deterioration that may reasonably be predicted to result in the need for inpatient commitment to a 24-hour facility. 75 When the physician or psychologist recommends substance abuse commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends substance abuse commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm that recommendation, the type of order issued by the magistrate depends upon the recommendation of the physician or eligible psychologist as stated in the \"Examination and Recommendation\" form. 76 If the physician recommends that the respondent be held at a 24-hour facility, the magistrate issues a custody order to transport the respondent directly to the designated 24-hour facility for examination and custody pending a district court hearing AOC-SP- 302, block 2). If the physician recommends that the respondent be released pending a hearing, the magistrate issues an order that a hearing before a district court judge be held to determine whether the respondent will be involuntarily committed (AOC- SP-305). Designate the 24-Hour Facility To Which Respondent Taken In the final part of the first page of the custody order, the magistrate must fill in the name of the designated 24-hour facility77 to which the respondent may be 73. Id. 74. The form is \"Notice of Hearing/Rehearing for Involuntary 5-72-01. 77. Under G.S. 122C-252 hospita ls must be designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to receive and treat involuntarily committed respondents. Any facility IVC - Page 40September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 15 taken if the first examiner finds that the respondent is an appropriate candidate for inpatient commitment or if the petitioner is a physician or psychologist who recommends inpatient commitment. Note that the magistrate does not put the place for the officer to take the respondent to the first evaluation (in other words the mental health center or local hospital emergency room) in this block. The form and statute require that the magistrate put the designated 24-hour facility to which the respondent will be taken for the second evaluation and at which he or she will be held for a district court hearing. The Department of Health and Human Services maintains a list of designated 24-hour facilities on its website at http: //www/ ncdhhs.gov/mhddsas/ ivc/ ivcdesignatedfacilities_6-14-07.pdf. In order to ensure that the respondent will be admitted to any designated 24-hour facility (state psychiatric hospital or local public or private hospital that has been designated by the State to take involuntary commitments) to which he or she might be taken, the magistrate should name the 24-hour facility to which most respondents are sent and then put \"any designated 24-hour facility,\" (e.g. \"Broughton Hospital or any designated facility\"). Some magistrates merely put \"any designated 24-hour facility\" without naming any specific facility. Private Hospital Placements A respondent who has the resources to pay for the cost of inpatient hospital care without the use of any public funds may select a private facility for treatment and care. In those cases where the respondent is able to choo se a private placement, the petitioner must have already have made arrangements with the chosen facility and if it is clear that the private facility has agreed to accept the respondent, the magistrate should fill in the name of that facility on the order. 78 If the family has not made prior arrangements for admission to a private facility, the magistrate should send the respondent to the usual designated could take the respondent, but private hospitals may not take indigent respondents. 78. G.S. 122C-263(d)(2) implies that direct commitment to a private hospital is appropriate when it provides that if the first examiner recommends inpatient commitment, \"the law enforcement officer ... shall take the respondent to a [designated] 24-hour facility.... If there is no area 24-hour facility and if the respondent is indigent and unable to pay for care at a private 24-hour facility, the law enforcement officer ... shall take the respondent to a State facility for the mentally ill....\" 24-hour facility and the Local Management Entity or facility staff can transfer a respondent who qualifies for admission to a private hospital. Requirement to Contact Area Authority Before Issuing Custody Order In two different circumstan ces, the magistrate must contact the local mental hea lth center before issuing a custody order. First, in cases where the magistrate has found that the respondent is probably mentally retarded, in addition to being mentally ill, he or she must contact the area author ity (local mental health center) before issuing any order. 79 When the petitioner is not a physician or an eligible psychologist, the area authority will tell the magistrate where to take the respondent for the initial and second examinations. The magistrate should indicate to the officer wher e to take the respondent for the first evaluation and should write the location of the second evaluation in the block on the form \"name of 24-hr. facility for mentally ill.\" When the petitioner is a physician or eligible psychologist, the area authority will designate the 24-hour facility to which the respondent should be taken and the magistrate should write this location down on the order in the block for the 24-hour facility for mentally ill. In the event that a mentally retarded person gets beyond the magistrate without the petitioner asserting and the magistrate finding that the person is mentally retarded and the mental retardation is discovered at the first evaluation, the examiner at the first evaluation can fill in a non-state facility in the box designated \"or following facility designated by area authority.\" Second, some counties have local policies that require the magistrate to contact the local mental health center before issuing a custody order. If the chief district court judge has approved the policy, it should be followed by the magistrates. Who Serves the Custody Order When the magistrate issues a custody order, generally a law enforcement officer serves the order. City police officers are responsible for transportation to a location within the county if the respondent resides, or was taken into custody, within city limits. If the respondent resides, or was taken into custody, in the county but outside city limits, the county deputy sheriffs are responsible fo r transportation, including 79. G.S. 122C-261(b). IVC - Page 41Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 16 transportation to locations outside the county.80 This statute is confusing if a respondent resides in the city but is found in the county outside the city limits or vice versa since in those situations both the police and sheriff are designated to transport for evaluations within the county. The local law enforcement agencies must determine which agency transports in those circumstances. There are two situations where persons other than law enforcement officers may provide transportation under a custody order. The city or county may designate volunteers or other personnel to provide transportation rather than using law enforcement officers. 81 The persons designated by the city or county follow the same procedure as law enforcement officers. Magistrates may authorize family members or immediate friends of the respondent to carry out the custody order if the following criteria are met: first, a family member or immediate friend must make a request to transport the respondent; and second, the magistrate must find that the respondent does not pose substantial danger to the public. 82 The critical word is \"substantial\" since all respondents must be dangerous. For example the second criterion might be met in a case where the respondent is an older person who has been found dangerous to self because he is unable to care for himself but becomes extremely agitated when dealing with law enforcement officers. If the magistrate authorizes transportation by a family member or friend, in addition to completing the custody order, the magistrate must also complete the form entitled \"Request and Authorization to Deliver Respondent\" (AOC-SP-902M). The magistrate should inform the family member or friend providing the transportation where to take the respondent for the initial evaluation and where to take the respondent for the second evaluation if necessary (which is the 24-hour facility designated by the magistrate on the custody order). The magistrate also should inform the person that he or she must return to the clerk of court the form entitled \"Request and Authorization to Deliver Respondent\" with the acknowledgement of delivery filled in and the \"Custody Order\" with the \"preliminary examination\" section filled in. Validity 80. G.S. 81. G.S. 122C-251(g). 82. G.S. 122C-251 (f). The magistrate's custody order directs any law enforcement officer to ta ke the respondent into custody and transport him or her as directed in the order within 24 hours afte r the order is issued and without unnecessary delay after assuming custody. 83 If the respondent is not taken into custody within 24 hours of issuance of the order, the order is no longer valid and the officer may not take the respondent into custody after that time. What is not clear is the procedure that must be followed if the respondent is not taken into custody within 24 hours and the petitioner still wishes to commit the respondent. One possibility is for the magistrate to issue a second custody order based on the first petition. The other course of action would be to require the petitioner to present evidence of the respondent's continued dangerousness in a new petition and issue a new order based on that petition. The procedure the magistrate follows may depend on the nature of the facts presented in the first petition. Some facts would support the issuance of a custody order even though one or more days might have passed since anyone has seen the respondent and since the issuance of the custody order. Other facts may present a weaker case with the passage of a day or more. If at the time the request for a new custody order is made, the magistrate determines that the facts alleged in the first petition lead the magistrate to find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent now meets the criteria for commitment, th e magistrate can issue a second order based on the first petition. 84 Where is the order valid? For example, what if a respondent moves back and forth between counties? As long as the custody order was issued by an appropriate magistrate\u2014one sitting in a county where the respondent either resided or was found\u2014it can be served on the respondent anywhere in North Carolina. 85 The only difficulty with service is a practical one of getting the order to the appropriate law enforcement agency in the county where the respondent is to be taken into custody. Generally, an officer from the magistrate's county delivers the order to the appropriate ag ency. Although there are no cases or statute governing the situation, it probably is sufficient for the officer holding the original custody order to fax a copy of the order and petition to a law enforcement agency in the county where the respondent is now believed to be found for service. 83. G.S. 122C-261(e), -281(e). 84. There are no reported cases in North Carolina dealing with this issue. 85. G.S. 122C-261(e), -281(e). IVC - Page 42September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 17 Inform Petitioner of Next Steps If the magistrate issues a custody order for a mentally ill respondent, the magistrate must provide the petitioner (and respondent, if present) with information regarding the next steps in the process. 86 Although the statute containing this requirement does not enumerate specific pieces of information that should be relayed, the magistrate should inform the petitioner that: (1) the custody order is a document that initiates the process leading to commitment; it is not the commitment order itself; (2) the respondent will be taken into custody by a law enforcement officer and taken to a local facility to be examined by a physician or psychologist who will make one of three recommendations: (a) release the respondent because he or she does not meet the commitment criteria; (b) release the respondent but schedule a district court hearing within 10 days because the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment; (c) take the respondent to a 24-hour facility because he or she meets the criteria for inpatient commitment. (3) if the second examiner recommends inpatient commitment, the respondent will be held at the 24-hour facility for observation and treatment pending a district court hearing to be held within 10 days. The facility staff must release the respondent when he or she no longer meets the criteria for involuntary commitment. A model notice of next steps is found at Appendix III at the end of this bulletin. 87 Inquiry Into Respondent's Indigence Upon issuing a custody order for inpatient commitment, the magistrate is required by law to inquire as to whether the respondent is indigent (and thus entitled to have appointed counsel at the district court hearing).88 However, many magistrates no longer make this inquiry because indigent respondents who are sent to a state psychiatric 86. G.S. 122C-261(b). 87. The notice is a slightly modified version of one drafted by Mark Botts, a School of Government faculty member who specializes in mental health law. 88. G.S. 122C-261(c), -281(c). hospital are entitled to receive representation from the special counsel and in that situation determining whether a respondent is indigent is the responsibility of the special counsel.89 At hearings for mentally ill persons in counties other than where state hospitals are located, counsel is appointed for indigent respondents in accordance with the rules adopted by the Office of Indigent Defense Services. 90 However, even if a mentally ill respondent is not indigent, but refuses to retain counsel, the Office of Indigent Defense Services must appoint counsel for him or her anyway.91 Therefore, for most mentally ill respondents counsel is going to be appointed so a magistrate's determination of indigence is unnecessary. For substance abuse respondents, the statute provides that the clerk of c ourt, upon direction of the district court judge, assigns counsel 92 who represents the respondent at the trial level, and upon appeal the Office of Indigent Defense Services appoints counsel. 93 Respondents who are recommended only for outpatient treatment (that is, those who are not at a state psychiatric hospital) do not have the right to counsel at their district court hearing. However, a judge may appoint counsel for an indigent respondent who is recommended only for outpatient commitment if the judge determines that the issues involved in the outpatient commitment are of significant complexity or that the respondent is unable to speak for himself or herself. 94 Magistrates who do conduct an indigence inquiry should use the form \"Affidavit of Indigency,\" AOC- CR-226. Emergency Commitments In addition to the regular procedure for initiating an involuntary commitment, there are two emergency procedures for circumstan ces where the respondent requires immediate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. 89. G.S. 122C-270(a). 90. G.S. 122C-270(d). Currently the judge or clerk the appointments. G.S. 122C-268(d). 43Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 18 Emergency Commitments for Mentally Ill Magistrates are not involved in emergency commitments of mentally ill respondents. The criteria for the special emergency procedure is that the person not only meet the criteria for a regular commitment but also that person is in need of immediate hospitalization to prevent harm to themselves or others. The emergency commitment procedure allows anyone, including law enforcement officers, to take the respondent directly to a local physician or psychologist or directly to a State facility for examination. 95 If the examiner finds that the respondent is, in fact, (1) mentally ill, (2) dangerous to self or others, and (3) in need of immediate hospitalization, the examiner will send sworn certification of this finding to the clerk of superior court on the form entitled \"Supplement to Support Immediate Hospitalization\" (DMH 5-72-01- A). This supplement must accompany the examiner's usual examination form (\"Examination and Recommendation To Determine Necessity for Involuntary Commitment,\" DMH 5-72-01). 96 The certification takes the place of the magistrate's custody order and requires a law enforcement officer to transport the respondent to a 24-hour facility for a second examination. If a person comes to the magistrate with an evaluation by a physician and the additional supplement certifying the need for immediate hospitalization, the magistrate should not issue a custody order but should indicate to the law enforcement officer that the certificate takes the place of a custody order. Emergency Commitment of Substance Abusers The special procedure for emergency commitment of substance abusers does involve magistrates. Only law enforcement officers may petition for emergency commitment of substance abusers. If a substance abuser is violent and requires restraint, and if delay in taking him or her to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination would probably endanger life or property, the law enforcement officer may take the substance abuser into custody and take 95. G.S. 122C-262. 96. Both forms are needed because the examiner must give facts supporting the mental illness and dangerousness as well as the need for immediate hospitalization, and the certificate for emergency commitment does not require facts supporting the mental illn ess and dangerousness. G.S. 122C-262(b), -264(b1). him or her immediately before a magistrate to seek a custody order.97 If magistrate finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence (note that this evidentiary standard is higher than that required in the non- emergency case) that (1) the facts in the affidavit are true, (2) that the respondent is in fact violent and in need of restraint, and (3) that delay in taking the respondent to a physician or eligible psychologist would endanger life or property, the magistrate must issue an emergency commitment order to take the respondent directly to a 24-hour facility, bypassing the first examination. The form is entitled \"Petition for Special Emergency Subs tance Abuse Involuntary Commitment Petition and Custody Order\" (AOC-SP-909M). Transportation Orders In addition to issuing custody orders that require officers to transport the respondent for examination in response to a petition for involuntary commitment, magistrates may order law enforcement officers to provide transportation in two other situations. First, if a substance abuser who is under an order for outpatient treatment fails to comply with that order, the area mental health authority or supervising physician may, after reasonable efforts to solicit the respondent's compliance, ask the magistrate to order that the respondent be taken into custody and transported to the area authority or physician for examination. 98 Also if a substance abuser who has been discharged from inpatient commitment and breaches the conditions of his or her release, the area mental health authority or physician may request that the respondent be taken into custody and transported to the area authority or physician for examination.99 Upon request, the magistrate must issue an order a law enforcement officer to transport the respondent to a designated physician for examination. The form is \"Request for Transportation Order and Order (Committed Substance Abuser Fails to Comply With Treatment or Is Discharged From 24-Hour Facility)\" (AOC-SP-223). The second situation in which the magistrate may be asked to issue a custody order is where transportation is needed to transfer certain respondents from one 24-hour facility to another. 100 In this situation, a respondent being held for a district court hearing or already comm itted by a district court 97. G.S. 99. Id. 100. G.S. 122C-206(c1). - Page 44September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 19 judge needs to be transferred from the 24-hour facility in which he or she is being held to another 24-hour facility. Frequently this occurs when the respondent was sent to a local hospital but that hospital is unable to handle the respondent and wants the respondent sent to a state psychiatric hospital. The magistrate may also be asked to transfer a minor or incompetent adult who was voluntarily admitted from one facility to another. If a responsible professional at the original facility notifies the magistrate to issue an order, the magistrate must order a law enforcement ag ency to transfer the respondent. The form is \"Notice of Need For Transportation Order and Order (From One 24-Hour Facility to Another)\" AOC-SP-222. Conclusion After a magistrate has issued an order to take a respondent into custody and transport him or her for examination, the magistrate's involvement in the process of involuntary civil commitment ends. From this point the respondent is examined by two professionals and, if these examinations reveal that the respondent meets the cr iteria for commitment, the respondent will receive a hear ing in the district court, at which time the judge may commit the respondent.

Page 48September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 23 Appendix III Steps Following the Issuance of a Custody Order for Involuntary Commitment Upon request, the magistrate or clerk of court has issued an order for custody and transportation of a person alleged to be in need of examination and treatment. This order is not an order of commitment but only authorizes the person to be evaluated and treated until a court hearing is held. The individual making the request has filed a petition with the court for this purpose and is, therefore, called the \"petitioner.\" The individual to be taken into custody for examination will have an opportunity to respond to the petition and is, therefore, called the \"respondent.\" If you are taken into cust ody, the word \"respondent,\" below, refers to you. G.S. 122C-261(b) requires that the petitioner and the respondent, if present, be informed of the next steps that will occur for the respondent. 1. A law enforcement officer or other person designated in the custody order must take the respondent into custody within 24 hours. If the respondent cannot be found within 24 hours, a new custody order will be required to take the respondent into custody. Custody is not for the purpose of arrest, but for the respondent's own safety and the safety of others, and to determine if the respondent is in need of treatment. 2. Without unnecessary delay after assuming custody, the law enforcement officer or other individual designated to provide transportation must take the re spondent to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination. 3. The respondent must be examined as soon as possibl e, and in any event within 24 hours, after being presented for examination. 4. Upon examination, the physician or psychologist w ill recommend either outpatient commitment, inpatient commitment, substance abuse commitment, or termination of these proceedings. Inpatient commitment: If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for inpatient commitment, the examiner shall r ecommend inpatient commitment. The law enforcement officer or other designated person shall take the respondent to a 24-hour facility. Outpatient commitment: If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment, the examiner will recommend outpatient commitment and identify the proposed outpatient treatment physician or ce nter in the examination report. The person designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the originating county. The respondent shall be released from custody. Substance abuse commitment: If the examiner find s the respondent meets the criteria for substance abuse commitment, the examiner shall recommend commitment and whether the respondent should be released or held at a 24-hour facility pending a district court hearing. Based on the physician's recommendation, the law enforcement officer or other designated individual shall take respondent to a 24-hour facility or release the respondent. Termination: If the examiner finds the respondent meets neither of the criteria for commitment, the respondent must be released from custody and the proceedings terminated. If the custody order was based on the finding that respondent was probably mentally ill, then the person designated in the order to provide transportation must return respondent to the respo ndent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting indivi dual located in the originating county. 5. If inpatient treatment is recommended, the law enforcement officer transports the respondent to a designated 24 hour facility where another evaluation must be performed within 24 hours. This evaluator has the same options as indicated in step 4 above. If th e evaluator determines that the respondent needs inpatient treatment, the respondent is admitted to the facility for care and treatment. 6. The inpatient treatment provider must release the respondent when in the provider's professional opinion the respondent no longer meets commitment criteria. If the respondent is not released, the respondent will be given a hearing before a district court judge within 10 days of date respondent taken into custody. The hearing is usually held in the county where the 24-hour facility is located unless the respondent request a hearing in the county where the petition was initiated.

Verify the interpreter's credentials. If it is an in-court proceeding, make sure the interpreter is sworn in before the proceeding begins. Verify credentials by consulting your state or federal court ros- ter, or by calling your local court (clerk's office or interpreter's office). Judges should conduct a voir dire of the interpreter and ask for credentials to be stated on the record.Do not use untrained bilinguals. It is inappropriate to use family members, children, foreign language students or teachers, court staff, or law enforcement officers as interpreters.Don't allow defendants to bring their own interpreters \u2014 not only does this practice create potential conflicts of interest, but the ad hoc person acting as \"interpreter\" may not be trained or competent.Don't ask for a translator when you need an interpreter \u2014 they are not interchangeable. Translators work with written communication. Interpreters work with oral communication. Be aware that an interpreter creates an 2. even playing field for limited-English speakers; an interpreter provides no advantage or disadvantage. Interpreters should never interject their own knowledge, comments, or opinions into the inter-pretation. Interpreters are prohibited from advocating for any party.Don't ask interpreters what they think a defendant or witness might or might not have understood; it is not their area of expertise. Use the interpreter to facilitate direct communication with 3. limited-English proficient parties, not as a \"go-between.\" Address the client directly in English, as if he understood everything you are saying. The interpreter will then repeat what you have said in the required language. This avoids the use of indirect speech (e.g., \"Ask him if ...\" or \"He says that...\"), which can create confusion and a flawed record. Check to make sure that all speech, by all parties, is being 4. interpreted. If someone is speaking and the interpreter's mouth is not mov- ing, there is a problem. If someone makes a lengthy statement and the interpretation is a few words, or vice versa, there is a problem. The interpreter's job is to interpret everything that is being said\u2014 no omissions, modifications, or additions.In court, an interpreter should be interpreting simultaneously for a defendant. If a non-English speaking witness testifies, an interpreter should interpret the questions and answers con-secutively so that a clear record may be made. To be understood, speak clearly at a moderate speed and an 5. audible volume. Unclear speech cannot be accurately interpreted. Avoid inter- ruptions and overlapping voices. Avoid long, convoluted ques-tions. Unfamiliar jargon or acronyms may cause a problem for the interpreter.Although reluctant to interrupt the give-and-take of courtroom exchanges, interpreters have an ethical obligation to ask for a repetition if speech is too low, too fast, too lengthy or incomprehensible ( due to the use of unknown references, heavy accent, jargon, abbreviations, or acronyms). Very long or complex questions and answers can result in interruptions or incomplete rendering by the interpreter, causing confusion. The interpreter's only task is to 6. interpret. In order to conserve impartiality and confidentiality, the interpreter should not be asked to be alone with a defendant. Whenever possible, the interpreter will exit the room when the attorney exits the room. Interpreters may not reveal information they have interpreted, but no privilege protects them if communication occurs when the attorney is not present. Any explanations that need to be made should be made by the attorney and then interpreted. The interpreter may, however, note and report to the attorney any confusion due to culture or vocabulary, and make an appropriate request for clarification. Provide interpreters with the information and support 7. needed to get the job done. The more information an interpreter has about a case, the better he or she can interpret. Arrange for interpreters to receive or have access to documents related to the assignment: complaints and indictments with supporting documents, investigative reports, motions and responses, witness and exhibit lists, bank and telephone records, PSRs, etc. Whenever possible, try to use the same interpreter for both in-court and out-of-court events in a given case.Language and Litigation What judges and attorneys need to know about interpreters in the legal process Judith Kenigson Kristy Language Access Services - Page 13Proteus volume X viii, No. 4 NaJiTpage 4 Whenever possible, inform defendants, court participants, and jurors about the interpreter's role. In order to ensure an accurate record, provide a team of two 8. interpreters for any lengthy or complex proceeding. Studies have shown that interpreters, no matter how experi - enced or competent, suffer mental fatigue after about 30 minutes of continuous interpreting. The use of a team prevents interpreter fatigue and ensures accuracy. Teams act as a safety net, so that any errors may be corrected and terminology queries answered. When a large number of defendants will be present at a proceeding, it may be necessary to hire more interpreters to facilitate attorney-client consultations. A conflict of interest is not the same for an interpreter as for 9. an attorney. An interpreter can work for either side or both sides of a case. The only prohibition is that an interpreter cannot be a witness in the same case in which he is acting as a proceedings interpreter. Interpreters cannot be advocates or take sides. They are neutral officers of the court and thus may work for either side, or both sides, of a dispute. A proceedings interpreter should reveal to the judge and parties any prior contacts with the case. However, a conflict does arise if an interpreter may be called by one of the parties as a witness. An interpreter cannot testify as an expert witness and also work as a proceedings interpreter in the same case. Foreign-language evidence should be handled appropriately. 10. The party offering the evidence should obtain prior transcrip - tion and translation of any tape recordings. Foreign-language documents introduced into evidence should be accompa-nied by a translation. (The translation may be stipulated, or authenticated through testimony.) A sound file or tape record-ing should never be translated \"on the spot\" in court. Just as there are experts in fingerprint identification, there are experts in transcribing and translating recorded material for evidentiary purposes. Find and use an expert for this kind of work. Never ask an interpreter to render a simultaneous inter - pretation of recorded material in court \u2014 at best, the results will be approximate and guesswork, not evidence. Interpreters are support staff for your court: please help promote an atmosphere of consideration, respect, and cooperation among those who work with them. When interpreters work in the judicial system, they need a table in the courtroom for notebooks or laptops, a cup of water, a place to store their belongings, and a place to rest when off duty. Your kindness is much appreciated. [ \u00a9 2008. May be reproduced for educa tional purposes with permission of the author.

CLARIFYING THE INTERPRETER'S ROLE TO THE JURY* This court seeks a fair trial for all regardless of the language they speak and regardless of how well they may or may not speak English. Bias against or for persons who have li le or no pro ciency in English is not allowed. Therefore, do not allow the fact that the party requires an interpreter to in any way in fluence you. CLARIFYING THE INTERPRETER'S ROLE TO THE WITNESS I want you to understand the role of the interpreter. The interpreter is here only to interpret the proceedings. The interpreter will say only what is said in your language and will not add, omit, or summarize anything. The interpreter will say in English everything that you say in your language, so do not say anything you do not want everyone to hear. If you do not understand a ques on asked of you, request clari caon from the person who asked it. Do not ask the interpreter. You are giving tesmony to this court; therefore please speak directly to the aorney or to me (the court). Do not ask the interpreter for advice. Speak in a loud clear voice. If you do not understand the interpreter please tell me. If you need the interpreter to repeat, please make your request to me, not to the interpreter. Please wait un l the enre statement has been interpreted before you answer. Do you have any quesons? Evaluate the need for an interpreter. Require an interpreter approved by OLAS. Allow the interpreter to meet with the LEP individual brie fly prior to the proceeding to con rm the ability to communicate, and to view the court le prior to the proceeding to become familiar with case terminology, names, and dates. Allow the interpreter to review any documents that will need to be sight translated during the proceeding. Make sure that the interpreter is located in a posi on that allows the interpreter to see and hear everything that happens in the courtroom. Administer the interpreter's oath. Have the interpreter state his / her name and quali caons on the record. Explain the role of the interpreter to the par es, witnesses, and the jury on the record. Advise witnesses to speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Emphasize that the record produced by the court reporter or court recorder is the ocial record of the proceeding. Provide breaks every 30 minutes for the interpreter or require a team of two interpreters for proceedings expected to last longer than two hours. Observe the interpreter's conduct, communica on, and interac on with parcipants; if problems arise, use a sidebar conference with a orneys and the interpreter or a recess to address and correct the problems. Keep in mind that the interpreter may be needed in other courtrooms.

Language Access Services - Page 18 MEMORANDUM To: Superior Court Judges, District Court Judges, Clerks of Superior Court, Trial Court Coordinators, Trial Court Administrators, District Attorneys, Public Defenders, Magistrates, Language Access Stakeholders Committee From: Brooke B. Crozier Date: April 30, 2015 Re: Expansion of Language Access Services to All Cases Heard before Magistrates As indicated in Judge Smith's August 8, 2012, memorandum ,1 the North Carolina unified court system is committed to the continued provision and expansion of language access services to limited English proficient (LEP) persons whom the courts serve . This memorandum announces the expansion of language access services to all civil proceedings before the magistrate, including marriages, effective Friday, May 1, 2015. As of that date, foreign language court interpreters now shall be provided at state expense to LEP parties in interest in all court proceedings heard before the magistrate on or after May 1, and subsequent appeals to district court. With the cooperation of all judicial officials and court personnel, we should be able to provide services for these cases using existing resources. The key is to ensure that an interpreter is scheduled only when it is clear that the proceeding for which the interpreter is requested is, in fact, going to be heard by the court. To assist your courts with effective interpreter scheduling, a two-sided chart to assist with scheduling court interpreters for courts is attached. The charts distinguish between districts with staff court interpreters assigned and districts without staff court interpreters, and between Spanish language 1 Memoranda regarding language access services can be viewed at http://www.nccourts.org/LanguageAccess/Interpreters/Policies.asp Language Access Services - Page 19North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts - April 30, 2015 Page 2 of 2 needs and LOTS. Please use the one that applies to your district. An updated Working with Court Interpreters - A Guide for Judges bench card has also been posted on the website for reference. 2 Providing court interpreters and scheduling cases requiring court interpreters may be a new process for many, so the Office of Language Access Services (OLAS) offers the following tips to assist you: 1. When actions are filed, the language access needs of either of the parties should be identified and noted in the case file. Remember to always err on the side of caution and provide an interpreter if there is any doubt about a party's ability to read, speak, or understand English at a level sufficient to understand everything that is said during the proceeding, and to communicate effectively. If a request for an interpreter is received by the party, an interpreter should be provided. 2. Court personnel and judicial officials in criminal courts and civil courts must coordinate calendars to make th e most judicious use of the interpreter's time throughout the courthouse. Court interpreters are expected to cover the needs of the entire courthouse for all covered case types, so please expect to share the interpreter and communicate scheduling needs with each other. 3. For Spanish language needs before the Magistrate, it may not be necessary to schedule an interpreter specifically for the proceeding. In many cases, a Spanish court interpreter is already scheduled to provide interpreting services in your courthouse for a District Court and / or Superior Court session. If this is the case, please utilize this same interpreter to cover the interpreting needs before the Magistrate. Unless the interpreter is providing services for an LEP party in a trial which requires the interpreter's constant presence, the interpreter will likely have sufficient down time between cases to cover your needs. 4. Interpreting services for LOTS must be requested in advance by the parties or attorneys to give OLAS time to locate and assign the appropriate language interpreter for the proceeding. The attached charts provide links to the request forms. 5. Failure to provide sufficient time to secure a qualified court interpreter may result in a delay or postponement of the court proceeding if a qualified interpreter is not available. 6. If proceedings are identified that require interpreting in the same language, those cases should be grouped and scheduled on the same day and a single interpreter scheduled to cover all of them . Requests will be easier to fill, particularly for Spanish language needs, if more than one case is scheduled on the calendar that will utilize the services of the court interpreter. 7. Interpreters are neutral language conduits, so it is not necessary to schedule an interpreter for each party in a single case if the parties speak the same foreign language. 2 Updated Bench Card: http://www.nccourts.org/LanguageAccess/Documents/benchcard.pdf Page 2 Language Access Services - Page 20North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts - April 30, 2015 Page 2 of 3 8. Make every effort to minimize the interpreter's time in the court proceeding by hearing the cases requiring an interpreter as soon as possible after the interpreter arrives in the courtroom. 9. Notify the interpreter as soon as the case is delayed, continued or otherwise disposed . The interpreter is entitled to payment if you fail to notify him of cancellation at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled court proceeding. OLAS will provide technical assistance to court officials to develop and implement procedures for expansion and the efficient allocation of current staff and contract interpreting services. If you have any questions about this memorandum or future plans, please contact OLAS staff at (919) 890-1407.

By JOHN TIERNEY Three men doing time in Israeli prisons recently appeared before a parole board consisting of a judge, a criminologist and a social worker. The three prisoners had completed at least two-thirds of their sentences,but the parole board granted freedom to only one of them. Guess which one: Case 1 (heard at 8:50 a.m.): An Arab Israeli serving a 30-month sentence for fraud.Case 2 (heard at 3:10 p.m.): A Jewish Israeli serving a 16-month sentence for assault.Case 3 (heard at 4:25 p.m.): An Arab Israeli serving a 30-month sentence for fraud.There was a pattern to the parole board's decisions, but it wasn't related to the men's ethnic backgrounds, crimes or sentences. It was all about timing, as researchers discovered by analyzing more than 1,100decisions over the course of a year. Judges, who would hear the prisoners' appeals and then get advice fromthe other members of the board, approved parole in about a third of the cases, but the probability of beingparoled fluctuated wildly throughout the day. Prisoners who appeared early in the morning received paroleabout 70 percent of the time, while those who appeared late in the day were paroled less than 10 percent ofthe time. The odds favored the prisoner who appeared at 8:50 a.m. \u2014 and he did in fact receive parole. But even though the other Arab Israeli prisoner was serving the same sentence for the same crime \u2014 fraud \u2014 theodds were against him when he appeared (on a different day) at 4:25 in the afternoon. He was deniedparole, as was the Jewish Israeli prisoner at 3:10 p.m, whose sentence was shorter than that of the man whowas released. They were just asking for parole at the wrong time of day. There was nothing malicious or even unusual about the judges' behavior, which was reported earlier this year by Jonathan Levav of Stanford and Shai Danziger of Ben-Gurion University. The judges' erratic judgment was due to the occupational hazard of being, as George W. Bush once put it, \"the decider.\" The mental work of ruling on case after case, whatever the individual merits, wore them down. This sort ofdecision fatigue can make quarterbacks prone to dubious choices late in the game and C.F.O.'s prone todisastrous dalliances late in the evening. It routinely warps the judgment of everyone, executive andnonexecutive, rich and poor \u2014 in fact, it can take a special toll on the poor. Yet few people are even awareof it, and researchers are only beginning to understand why it happens and how to counteract it. Avoiding Bias - Page 7Do You Suffer From Decision Fatigue? - NYTimes.com file:///S|/...02014/Tab%2013-Avoiding%20Bias/Do%20You%20Suffer%20From%20Decision%20Fatigue%20%20-%20NYTimes.com.html[1/14/2014 9:43:02 AM]Decision fatigue helps explain why ordinarily sensible people get angry at colleagues and families, splurge on clothes, buy junk food at the supermarket and can't resist the dealer's offer to rustproof their new car. No matter how rational and high-minded you try to be, you can't make decision after decision withoutpaying a biological price. It's different from ordinary physical fatigue \u2014 you're not consciously aware ofbeing tired \u2014 but you're low on mental energy. The more choices you make throughout the day, the hardereach one becomes for your brain, and eventually it looks for shortcuts, usually in either of two verydifferent ways. One shortcut is to become reckless: to act impulsively instead of expending the energy tofirst think through the consequences. (Sure, tweet that photo! What could go wrong?) The other shortcut isthe ultimate energy saver: do nothing. Instead of agonizing over decisions, avoid any choice. Ducking adecision often creates bigger problems in the long run, but for the moment, it eases the mental strain. Youstart to resist any change, any potentially risky move \u2014 like releasing a prisoner who might commit acrime. So the fatigued judge on a parole board takes the easy way out, and the prisoner keeps doing time. Decision fatigue is the newest discovery involving a phenomenon called ego depletion, a term coined by the social psychologist Roy F. Baumeister in homage to a Freudian hypothesis. Freud speculated that the self, or ego, depended on mental activities involving the transfer of energy. He was vague about the details, though, and quite wrong about some of them (like his idea that artists \"sublimate\" sexual energy into theirwork, which would imply that adultery should be especially rare at artists' colonies). Freud's energy modelof the self was generally ignored until the end of the century, when Baumeister began studying mentaldiscipline in a series of experiments, first at Case Western and then at Florida State University. These experiments demonstrated that there is a finite store of mental energy for exerting self-control. When people fended off the temptation to scarf down M&M's or freshly baked chocolate-chip cookies, theywere then less able to resist other temptations. When they forced themselves to remain stoic during atearjerker movie, afterward they gave up more quickly on lab tasks requiring self-discipline, like working ona geometry puzzle or squeezing a hand-grip exerciser. Willpower turned out to be more than a folk conceptor a metaphor. It really was a form of mental energy that could be exhausted. The experiments confirmedthe 19th-century notion of willpower being like a muscle that was fatigued with use, a force that could beconserved by avoiding temptation. To study the process of ego depletion, researchers concentrated initiallyon acts involving self-control \u2014 the kind of self-discipline popularly associated with willpower, like resistinga bowl of ice cream. They weren't concerned with routine decision-making, like choosing between chocolateand vanilla, a mental process that they assumed was quite distinct and much less strenuous. Intuitively, thechocolate-vanilla choice didn't appear to require willpower. But then a postdoctoral fellow, Jean Twenge, started working at Baumeister's laboratory right after planning her wedding. As Twenge studied the results of the lab's ego-depletion experiments, sheremembered how exhausted she felt the evening she and her fianc\u00e9 went through the ritual of registeringfor gifts. Did they want plain white china or something with a pattern? Which brand of knives? How manytowels? What kind of sheets? Precisely how many threads per square inch? \"By the end, you could have talked me into anything,\" Twenge told her new colleagues. The symptoms sounded familiar to them too, and gave them an idea. A nearby department store was holding a going-out- Avoiding Bias - Page 8Do You Suffer From Decision Fatigue? - NYTimes.com file:///S|/...02014/Tab%2013-Avoiding%20Bias/Do%20You%20Suffer%20From%20Decision%20Fatigue%20%20-%20NYTimes.com.html[1/14/2014 9:43:02 AM]of-business sale, so researchers from the lab went off to fill their car trunks with simple products \u2014 not exactly wedding-quality gifts, but sufficiently appealing to interest college students. When they came to thelab, the students were told they would get to keep one item at the end of the experiment, but first they hadto make a series of choices. Would they prefer a pen or a candle? A vanilla-scented candle or an almond-scented one? A candle or a T-shirt? A black T-shirt or a red T-shirt? A control group, meanwhile \u2014 let's callthem the nondeciders \u2014 spent an equally long period contemplating all these same products without havingto make any choices. They were asked just to give their opinion of each product and report how often theyhad used such a product in the last six months. Afterward, all the participants were given one of the classic tests of self-control: holding your hand in ice water for as long as you can. The impulse is to pull your hand out, so self-discipline is needed to keep thehand underwater. The deciders gave up much faster; they lasted 28 seconds, less than half the 67-secondaverage of the nondeciders. Making all those choices had apparently sapped their willpower, and it wasn'tan isolated effect. It was confirmed in other experiments testing students after they went through exerciseslike choosing courses from the college catalog. For a real-world test of their theory, the lab's researchers went into that great modern arena of decision making: the suburban mall. They interviewed shoppers about their experiences in the stores that day andthen asked them to solve some simple arithmetic problems. The researchers politely asked them to do asmany as possible but said they could quit at any time. Sure enough, the shoppers who had already made themost decisions in the stores gave up the quickest on the math problems. When you shop till you drop, yourwillpower drops, too. Any decision, whether it's what pants to buy or whether to start a war, can be broken down into what psychologists call the Rubicon model of action phases, in honor of the river that separated Italy from theRoman province of Gaul. When Caesar reached it in 49 B.C., on his way home after conquering the Gauls,he knew that a general returning to Rome was forbidden to take his legions across the river with him, lest itbe considered an invasion of Rome. Waiting on the Gaul side of the river, he was in the \"predecisionalphase\" as he contemplated the risks and benefits of starting a civil war. Then he stopped calculating andcrossed the Rubicon, reaching the \"postdecisional phase,\" which Caesar defined much more felicitously:\"The die is cast.\" The whole process could deplete anyone's willpower, but which phase of the decision-making process was most fatiguing? To find out, Kathleen Vohs, a former colleague of Baumeister's now at the University ofMinnesota, performed an experiment using the self-service Web site of Dell Computers. One group in theexperiment carefully studied the advantages and disadvantages of various features available for a computer\u2014 the type of screen, the size of the hard drive, etc. \u2014 without actually making a final decision on whichones to choose. A second group was given a list of predetermined specifications and told to configure acomputer by going through the laborious, step-by-step process of locating the specified features among thearrays of options and then clicking on the right ones. The purpose of this was to duplicate everything thathappens in the postdecisional phase, when the choice is implemented. The third group had to figure out for themselves which features they wanted on their computers and go through the process of choosing them; Avoiding Bias - Page 9Do You Suffer From Decision Fatigue? - NYTimes.com file:///S|/...02014/Tab%2013-Avoiding%20Bias/Do%20You%20Suffer%20From%20Decision%20Fatigue%20%20-%20NYTimes.com.html[1/14/2014 9:43:02 AM]they didn't simply ponder options (like the first group) or implement others' choices (like the second group). They had to cast the die, and that turned out to be the most fatiguing task of all. When self-controlwas measured, they were the one who were most depleted, by far. The experiment showed that crossing the Rubicon is more tiring than anything that happens on either bank \u2014 more mentally fatiguing than sitting on the Gaul side contemplating your options or marching on Romeonce you've crossed. As a result, someone without Caesar's willpower is liable to stay put. To a fatiguedjudge, denying parole seems like the easier call not only because it preserves the status quo and eliminatesthe risk of a parolee going on a crime spree but also because it leaves more options open: the judge retainsthe option of paroling the prisoner at a future date without sacrificing the option of keeping him securely inprison right now. Part of the resistance against making decisions comes from our fear of giving up options.The word \"decide\" shares an etymological root with meaning \"to cutdown\" or \"to kill,\" and that loss looms especially large when decision fatigue sets in. Once you're mentally depleted, you become reluctant to make trade-offs, which involve a particularly advanced and taxing form of decision making. In the rest of the animal kingdom, there aren't a lot ofprotracted negotiations between predators and prey. To compromise is a complex human ability andtherefore one of the first to decline when willpower is depleted. You become what researchers call acognitive miser, hoarding your energy. If you're shopping, you're liable to look at only one dimension, likeprice: just give me the cheapest. Or you indulge yourself by looking at quality: I want the very best (anespecially easy strategy if someone else is paying). Decision fatigue leaves you vulnerable to marketers whoknow how to time their sales, as Jonathan Levav, the Stanford professor, demonstrated in experimentsinvolving tailored suits and new cars. The idea for these experiments also happened to come in the preparations for a wedding, a ritual that seems to be the decision-fatigue equivalent of Hell Week. At his fianc\u00e9e's suggestion, Levav visited a tailorto have a bespoke suit made and began going through the choices of fabric, type of lining and style ofbuttons, lapels, cuffs and so forth. \"By the time I got through the third pile of fabric swatches, I wanted to kill myself,\" Levav recalls. \"I couldn't tell the choices apart anymore. After a while my only response to the tailor became 'What do yourecommend?' I just couldn't take it.\" Levav ended up not buying any kind of bespoke suit (the $2,000 price made that decision easy enough), but he put the experience to use in a pair of experiments conducted with Mark Heitmann, then atChristian-Albrechts University in Germany; Andreas Herrmann, University of St. Gallen inSwitzerland; and Sheena Iyengar, of Columbia. One involved asking M.B.A. students in Switzerland tochoose a bespoke suit; the other was conducted at German car dealerships, where customers orderedoptions for their new sedans. The car buyers \u2014 and these were real customers spending their own money \u2014had to choose, for instance, among 4 styles of gearshift knobs, 13 kinds of wheel rims, 25 configurations ofthe engine and gearbox and a palette of 56 colors for the interior. Avoiding Bias - Page 10Do You Suffer From Decision Fatigue? - NYTimes.com file:///S|/...02014/Tab%2013-Avoiding%20Bias/Do%20You%20Suffer%20From%20Decision%20Fatigue%20%20-%20NYTimes.com.html[1/14/2014 9:43:02 AM]As they started picking features, customers would carefully weigh the choices, but as decision fatigue set in, they would start settling for whatever the default option was. And the more tough choices they encountered early in the process \u2014 like going through those 56 colors to choose the precise shade of gray or brown \u2014the quicker people became fatigued and settled for the path of least resistance by taking the default option.By manipulating the order of the car buyers' choices, the researchers found that the customers would endup settling for different kinds of options, and the average difference totaled more than 1,500 euros per car(about $2,000 at the time). Whether the customers paid a little extra for fancy wheel rims or a lot extra fora more powerful engine depended on when the choice was offered and how much willpower was left in thecustomer. Similar results were found in the experiment with custom-made suits: once decision fatigue set in, people tended to settle for the recommended option. When they were confronted early on with the toughestdecisions \u2014 the ones with the most options, like the 100 fabrics for the suit \u2014 they became fatigued morequickly and also reported enjoying the shopping experience less. Shopping can be especially tiring for the poor, who have to struggle continually with trade-offs. Most of us in America won't spend a lot of time agonizing over whether we can afford to buy soap, but it can be a depleting choice in rural India. Dean Spears, an economist at Princeton, offered people in 20 villages inRajasthan in northwestern India the chance to buy a couple of bars of brand-name soap for the equivalentof less than 20 cents. It was a steep discount off the regular price, yet even that sum was a strain for thepeople in the 10 poorest villages. Whether or not they bought the soap, the act of making the decision leftthem with less willpower, as measured afterward in a test of how long they could squeeze a hand grip. Inthe slightly more affluent villages, people's willpower wasn't affected significantly. Because they had moremoney, they didn't have to spend as much effort weighing the merits of the soap versus, say, food ormedicine. Spears and other researchers argue that this sort of decision fatigue is a major \u2014 and hitherto ignored \u2014 factor in trapping people in poverty. Because their financial situation forces them to make so many trade-offs, they have less willpower to devote to school, work and other activities that might get them into themiddle class. It's hard to know exactly how important this factor is, but there's no doubt that willpower is aspecial problem for poor people. Study after study has shown that low self-control correlates with lowincome as well as with a host of other problems, including poor achievement in school, divorce, crime,alcoholism and poor health. Lapses in self-control have led to the notion of the \"undeserving poor\" \u2014epitomized by the image of the welfare mom using food stamps to buy junk food \u2014 but Spears urgessympathy for someone who makes decisions all day on a tight budget. In one study, he found that when thepoor and the rich go shopping, the poor are much more likely to eat during the shopping trip. This mightseem like confirmation of their weak character \u2014 after all, they could presumably save money and improvetheir nutrition by eating meals at home instead of buying ready-to-eat snacks like Cinnabons, whichcontribute to the higher rate of obesity among the poor. But if a trip to the supermarket induces moredecision fatigue in the poor than in the rich \u2014 because each purchase requires more mental trade-offs \u2014 bythe time they reach the cash register, they'll have less willpower left to resist the Mars bars and Skittles. Avoiding Bias - Page 11Do You Suffer From Decision Fatigue? - NYTimes.com file:///S|/...02014/Tab%2013-Avoiding%20Bias/Do%20You%20Suffer%20From%20Decision%20Fatigue%20%20-%20NYTimes.com.html[1/14/2014 9:43:02 AM]Not for nothing are these items called impulse purchases. And this isn't the only reason that sweet snacks are featured prominently at the cash register, just when shoppers are depleted after all their decisions in the aisles. With their willpower reduced, they're morelikely to yield to any kind of temptation, but they're especially vulnerable to candy and soda and anythingelse offering a quick hit of sugar. While supermarkets figured this out a long time ago, only recently didresearchers discover why. The discovery was an accident resulting from a failed experiment at Baumeister's lab. The researchers set out to test something called the Mardi Gras theory \u2014 the notion that you could build up willpower by first indulging yourself in pleasure, the way Mardi Gras feasters do just before the rigors of Lent. In place ofa Fat Tuesday breakfast, the chefs in the lab at Florida State whipped up lusciously thick milkshakes for agroup of subjects who were resting in between two laboratory tasks requiring willpower. Sure enough, thedelicious shakes seemed to strengthen willpower by helping people perform better than expected on thenext task. So far, so good. But the experiment also included a control group of people who were fed atasteless concoction of low-fat dairy glop. It provided them with no pleasure, yet it produced similarimprovements in self-control. The Mardi Gras theory looked wrong. Besides tragically removing an excusefor romping down the streets of New Orleans, the result was embarrassing for the researchers. MatthewGailliot, the graduate student who ran the study, stood looking down at his shoes as he told Baumeisterabout the fiasco. Baumeister tried to be optimistic. Maybe the study wasn't a failure. Something had happened, after all. Even the tasteless glop had done the job, but how? If it wasn't the pleasure, could it be the calories? At firstthe idea seemed a bit daft. For decades, psychologists had been studying performance on mental taskswithout worrying much about the results being affected by dairy-product consumption. They liked toenvision the human mind as a computer, focusing on the way it processed information. In their eagernessto chart the human equivalent of the computer's chips and circuits, most psychologists neglected onemundane but essential part of the machine: the power supply. The brain, like the rest of the body, derivedenergy from glucose, the simple sugar manufactured from all kinds of foods. To establish cause and effect,researchers at Baumeister's lab tried refueling the brain in a series of experiments involving lemonademixed either with sugar or with a diet sweetener. The sugary lemonade provided a burst of glucose, theeffects of which could be observed right away in the lab; the sugarless variety tasted quite similar withoutproviding the same burst of glucose. Again and again, the sugar restored willpower, but the artificialsweetener had no effect. The glucose would at least mitigate the ego depletion and sometimes completelyreverse it. The restored willpower improved people's self-control as well as the quality of their decisions:they resisted irrational bias when making choices, and when asked to make financial decisions, they weremore likely to choose the better long-term strategy instead of going for a quick payoff. The ego-depletioneffect was even demonstrated with dogs in two studies by Holly Miller and Nathan DeWall at the University of Kentucky. After obeying sit and stay commands for 10 minutes, the dogs performed worse on self-controltests and were also more likely to make the dangerous decision to challenge another dog's turf. But a doseof glucose restored their willpower.

Skeptics pointed out that the brain's overall use of energy remains about the same regardless of what aperson is doing, which doesn't square easily with the notion of depleted energy affecting willpower. Amongthe skeptics was Todd Heatherton, who worked with Baumeister early in his career and eventually woundup at Dartmouth, where he became a pioneer of what is called social neuroscience: the study of linksbetween brain processes and social behavior. He believed in ego depletion, but he didn't see how this neuralprocess could be caused simply by variations in glucose levels. To observe the process \u2014 and to see if itcould be reversed by glucose \u2014 he and his colleagues recruited 45 female dieters and recorded images oftheir brains as they reacted to pictures of food. Next the dieters watched a comedy video while forcingthemselves to suppress their laughter \u2014 a standard if cruel way to drain mental energy and induce egodepletion. Then they were again shown pictures of food, and the new round of brain scans revealed theeffects of ego depletion: more activity in the nucleus accumbens, the brain's reward center, and acorresponding decrease in the amygdala, which ordinarily helps control impulses. The food's appealregistered more strongly while impulse control weakened \u2014 not a good combination for anyone on a diet.But suppose people in this ego-depleted state got a quick dose of glucose? What would a scan of theirbrains reveal? The results of the experiment were announced in January, during Heatherton's speech accepting the leadership of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology , the world's largest group of social psychologists. In his presidential address at the annual meeting in San Antonio, Heatherton reported thatadministering glucose completely reversed the brain changes wrought by depletion \u2014 a finding, he said,that thoroughly surprised him. Heatherton's results did much more than provide additional confirmationthat glucose is a vital part of willpower; they helped solve the puzzle over how glucose could work withoutglobal changes in the brain's total energy use. Apparently ego depletion causes activity to rise in some partsof the brain and to decline in others. Your brain does not stop working when glucose is low. It stops doingsome things and starts doing others. It responds more strongly to immediate rewards and pays lessattention to long-term prospects. The discoveries about glucose help explain why dieting is a uniquely difficult test of self-control \u2014 and why even people with phenomenally strong willpower in the rest of their lives can have such a hard time losingweight. They start out the day with virtuous intentions, resisting croissants at breakfast and dessert atlunch, but each act of resistance further lowers their willpower. As their willpower weakens late in the day,they need to replenish it. But to resupply that energy, they need to give the body glucose. They're trappedin a nutritional catch-22: 1. In order not to eat, a dieter needs willpower.2. In order to have willpower, a dieter needs to eat.As the body uses up glucose, it looks for a quick way to replenish the fuel, leading to a craving for sugar. After performing a lab task requiring self-control, people tend to eat more candy but not other kinds ofsnacks, like salty, fatty potato chips. The mere expectation of having to exert self-control makes people Avoiding Bias - Page 13Do You Suffer From Decision Fatigue? - NYTimes.com file:///S|/...02014/Tab%2013-Avoiding%20Bias/Do%20You%20Suffer%20From%20Decision%20Fatigue%20%20-%20NYTimes.com.html[1/14/2014 9:43:02 AM]hunger for sweets. A similar effect helps explain why many women yearn for chocolate and other sugary treats just before menstruation: their bodies are seeking a quick replacement as glucose levels fluctuate. A sugar-filled snack or drink will provide a quick improvement in self-control (that's why it's convenient touse in experiments), but it's just a temporary solution. The problem is that what we identify as sugardoesn't help as much over the course of the day as the steadier supply of glucose we would get from eatingproteins and other more nutritious foods. The benefits of glucose were unmistakable in the study of the Israeli parole board. In midmorning, usually a little before 10:30, the parole board would take a break, and the judges would be served a sandwich and apiece of fruit. The prisoners who appeared just before the break had only about a 20 percent chance ofgetting parole, but the ones appearing right after had around a 65 percent chance. The odds dropped againas the morning wore on, and prisoners really didn't want to appear just before lunch: the chance of gettingparole at that time was only 10 percent. After lunch it soared up to 60 percent, but only briefly. Rememberthat Jewish Israeli prisoner who appeared at 3:10 p.m. and was denied parole from his sentence for assault?He had the misfortune of being the sixth case heard after lunch. But another Jewish Israeli prisoner servingthe same sentence for the same crime was lucky enough to appear at 1:27 p.m., the first case after lunch,and he was rewarded with parole. It must have seemed to him like a fine example of the justice system atwork, but it probably had more to do with the judge's glucose levels. It's simple enough to imagine reforms for the parole board in Israel \u2014 like, say, restricting each judge's shift to half a day, preferably in the morning, interspersed with frequent breaks for food and rest. But it's not so obvious what to do with the decision fatigue affecting the rest of society. Even if we could all affordto work half-days, we would still end up depleting our willpower all day long, as Baumeister and hiscolleagues found when they went into the field in W\u00fcrzburg in central Germany. The psychologists gavepreprogrammed BlackBerrys to more than 200 people going about their daily routines for a week. Thephones went off at random intervals, prompting the people to report whether they were currentlyexperiencing some sort of desire or had recently felt a desire. The painstaking study, led by WilhelmHofmann, then at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, collected more than 10,000 momentary reports frommorning until midnight. Desire turned out to be the norm, not the exception. Half the people were feeling some desire when their phones went off \u2014 to snack, to goof off, to express their true feelings to their bosses \u2014 and another quartersaid they had felt a desire in the past half-hour. Many of these desires were ones that the men and womenwere trying to resist, and the more willpower people expended, the more likely they became to yield to thenext temptation that came along. When faced with a new desire that produced some I-want-to-but-I-really-shouldn't sort of inner conflict, they gave in more readily if they had already fended off earlier temptations,particularly if the new temptation came soon after a previously reported one. The results suggested that people spend between three and four hours a day resisting desire. Put another way, if you tapped four or five people at any random moment of the day, one of them would be usingwillpower to resist a desire. The most commonly resisted desires in the phone study were the urges to eat and sleep, followed by the urge for leisure, like taking a break from work by doing a puzzle or playing a Avoiding Bias - Page 14Do You Suffer From Decision Fatigue? - NYTimes.com file:///S|/...02014/Tab%2013-Avoiding%20Bias/Do%20You%20Suffer%20From%20Decision%20Fatigue%20%20-%20NYTimes.com.html[1/14/2014 9:43:02 AM]game instead of writing a memo. Sexual urges were next on the list of most-resisted desires, a little ahead of urges for other kinds of interactions, like checking Facebook. To ward off temptation, people reportedusing various strategies. The most popular was to look for a distraction or to undertake a new activity,although sometimes they tried suppressing it directly or simply toughing their way through it. Their successwas decidedly mixed. They were pretty good at avoiding sleep, sex and the urge to spend money, but not sogood at resisting the lure of television or the Web or the general temptation to relax instead of work. We have no way of knowing how much our ancestors exercised self-control in the days before BlackBerrys and social psychologists, but it seems likely that many of them were under less ego-depleting strain. Whenthere were fewer decisions, there was less decision fatigue. Today we feel overwhelmed because there are somany choices. Your body may have dutifully reported to work on time, but your mind can escape at anyinstant. A typical computer user looks at more than three dozen Web sites a day and gets fatigued by thecontinual decision making \u2014 whether to keep working on a project, check out TMZ, follow a link toYouTube or buy something on Amazon. You can do enough damage in a 10-minute online shopping spreeto wreck your budget for the rest of the year. The cumulative effect of these temptations and decisions isn't intuitively obvious. Virtually no one has a gut-level sense of just how tiring it is to decide. Big decisions, small decisions, they all add up. Choosingwhat to have for breakfast, where to go on vacation, whom to hire, how much to spend \u2014 these all depletewillpower, and there's no telltale symptom of when that willpower is low. It's not like getting winded orhitting the wall during a marathon. Ego depletion manifests itself not as one feeling but rather as apropensity to experience everything more intensely. When the brain's regulatory powers weaken,frustrations seem more irritating than usual. Impulses to eat, drink, spend and say stupid things feel morepowerful (and alcohol causes self-control to decline further). Like those dogs in the experiment, ego-depleted humans become more likely to get into needless fights over turf. In making decisions, they takeillogical shortcuts and tend to favor short-term gains and delayed costs. Like the depleted parole judges,they become inclined to take the safer, easier option even when that option hurts someone else. \"Good decision making is not a trait of the person, in the sense that it's always there,\" Baumeister says. \"It's a state that fluctuates.\" His studies show that people with the best self-control are the ones who structuretheir lives so as to conserve willpower. They don't schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoidtemptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort ofmaking choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they setup regular appointments to work out with a friend. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust allday, they conserve it so that it's available for emergencies and important decisions. \"Even the wisest people won't make good choices when they're not rested and their glucose is low,\" Baumeister points out. That's why the truly wise don't restructure the company at 4 p.m. They don't makemajor commitments during the cocktail hour. And if a decision must be made late in the day, they knownot to do it on an empty stomach. \"The best decision makers,\" Baumeister says, \"are the ones who knowwhen not to trust themselves.\" Avoiding Bias - Page 15Do You Suffer - NYTimes.com file:///S|/...02014/Tab%2013-Avoiding%20Bias/Do%20You%20Suffer%20From%20Decision%20Fatigue%20%20-%20NYTimes.com.html[1/14/2014 9:43:02 AM]John Tierney (tierneylab@nytimes.com) is a science columnist for The Times.

Capacity to Marry A. Must be single. B. Must be 18 or older or between 16 and 18 with consent of parent or guardian. A 14 or 15 year old female who is pregnant or has a child or a 14 or 15 year old who is father of child or baby not yet born can petition the district court for a judge to authorize that person to marry. C. Persons of nearer kin than first cousins cannot marry. D. Common law marriages are not recognized. II. Marriage Licenses A. Do not perform ceremony without a valid license. B. License may be issued by Register of Deeds of any county in North Carolina. C. Marriage ceremony must be conducted within 60 days after license issued. D. Must be at least two witnesses to ceremony. E. Every magistr ate who marries a couple without a valid license or fails to return the license to the Register of Deeds within 10 (ten) days shall forfeit and pay $200 to any person who sues and shall be guilty of a midemeanor. 1. There is no specific procedure for \"returning\" marriage certificates to an out-of-county register of deeds. However, if magistrate mails them by first class mail, that should be sufficient. As an extra precaution, the magistrate might want to make a copy for his or her records with a notation of the date mailed. III. Marriage Ceremony A. Customarily man and woman stand facing magistrate with man to the woman's right, but no statutorily required positions. B. Couple must orally consent to take each other as husband and wife, freely, seriously and plainly. C. Must be in the presence of each other and authorized ordained minister or a magistrate. D. Officer must declare such persons as husband and wife. E. There must be two witnesses to the ceremony; witnesses may be under the age of 18 but must be able to sign their name and to relate and understand what they are observing. Marriage - Page 1 IV. Fees and certificates A. A $20.00 fee is collected by the magistrate for performing marriage ceremony. No other fee may be taken. Can go to the couple's party, reception. B. Fee is to be remitted to the Cl erk of Superior Court for use of State in support of General Court of Justice. C. The magistrate must fill out and sign both copies of the certificate and return both copies to register of deeds within 10 days. Failure to do so subjects magistrate to $200 penalty. V. Miscellaneous Issues A. Do you have to perform marriages? 1. It is a duty of your office and you can't refuse to marry a couple for a reason personal to you. For example, a magistrate who has very strong religious beliefs cannot refuse to marry a couple w ho want a purely civil ceremony with no reference to God. Nor may a magistrate refuse to perform a marriage because the magistrate doesn't like the looks of the couple or doesn't think the marriage will last. 2. However, because the couple must be able to consent freely, seriously and plainly to the marriage, magistrate may ask couple to come back later if intoxicated to point that cannot give valid consent. B. Where must you perform marriages? If a couple comes to you with a valid license and wants to be married in your office while you are on duty. C. Where may you perform marriages? You have the authority to perform a marriage ceremony anywhere in the State of North Carolina. 1. You may go anywhere in your county to perform the ceremony, but usually that means you have to be off-duty (unless you don't have to be physically in the office while on duty). You don't have to go out of the office to perform a ceremony; the choice is yours. However, the chief district judge, who has the authority to set times and places at which you perform your duties, may direct you to perform ceremonies out of the office as part of your obligations while on duty. 2. You may conduct a marriage ceremony in any other county in North Carolina. a) It is always best practice to notify your chief district judge before you perform an out-of- county marriage. b) Return license to Register of Deeds in county where issued. However, turn the $20 into your clerk and indicate on the receipt the county in which the marriage was performed. Marriage - Page 2 Marriage Problems \u2014J\u0003 1. John and Mary come to your office and give you a copy of the ceremony they'd like you to use, which includes an opportunity for them to recite their own vows. You look over the ceremony and confirm that it looks fairly standard, but note that it contains numerous references to \"God.\" Is there a legal problem with using the ceremony they provide? Can you refuse? 2. John and Mary have Mary's children with them to serve as witnesses. Jamie is 13, and Joanie is 6. Is the re a legal problem with using the kids as witnesses? 3. Jake is stationed in Iraq, and his fianc\u00e9e, Julie, will give birth any day now. The two desperately want to get married before the baby is born. Jake's unit has the technical capability of establish ing a video real-time link, so that he could participate in the wedding from Iraq. Julie asks you what she needs to do to work this out. What do you say? 4. Your best friend Glen lives in the same county as you, but wants to get married in Cherokee. He asks you to perform the ceremony. Can you? Must you? What do you do with the money? With the license? Glen is reserving rooms at a resort hotel for the few members of his family and friends who will be attending. Can you accept a room? Reimbursement for mileage?
