This contemporary Native American meal, crafted from the traditional foods of tribes across the United States and prepared with \"Ketapanen\" - a Menominee expression of love - cost caterer Jessica Pamonicutt $976 to feed a group of 50 people last November. Today it costs her nearly double. Pamonicutt is the executive chef of Chicago-based Native American catering business Ketapanen Kitchen. She is a citizen of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin but was raised in the Windy City, home to one of the largest urban Native populations in the country, according to the American Indian Center of Chicago. Her business aims to offer health-conscious meals featuring Indigenous ingredients to the Chicago Native community and educate people about Indigenous contributions to everyday American fare. One day, she aims to purchase all ingredients from Native suppliers and provide her community with affordable access to healthy Indigenous foods, \"but this whole inflation thing has slowed that down,\" she said. U.S. inflation surged to a new four-decade high in June, squeezing household budgets with painfully high prices for gas, food and rent. Traditional Indigenous foods \u2014 like wild rice, bison, fresh vegetables and fruit in the Midwest \u2014 are often unavailable or too expensive for Native families in urban areas like Chicago, and the recent inflation spike has propelled these foods even further out of reach. Risk of disease compounds the problem: healthy eating is key to battling diabetes, which afflicts Native Americans at the highest rate of any ethnic group in the United States. \"There are many benefits to eating traditional Native foods,\" said Jessica Thurin, a dietician at Native American Community Clinic in Minneapolis. \"The body knows exactly how to process and use that food. These foods are natural to the Earth.\" But many people the clinic serves are low-income and do not have the luxury of choosing where their food comes from. Food deserts - areas with limited access to a variety of healthy and affordable foods - are more likely to exist in places with higher rates of poverty and concentrations of minority populations. \"In these situations, there are limited healthy food options, not to mention limited traditional food options,\" Thurin said. Aside from health benefits, traditional foods hold important cultural and emotional value. \"It's just comfort,\" said Danielle Lucas, a 39-year-old descendant of the Sicangu Lakota people from the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. Lucas' mother, Evelyn Red Lodge, said she hasn't prepared traditional dishes of the Great Plains, like wojapi berry sauce or stew, since May because the prices of key ingredients - berries and meat - have soared. Pamonicutt, too, is feeling the pinch. Between last winter and this spring, the price of bison jumped from $13.99 to $23.99 per pound. Shipping costs are so high that the chef said it's often cheaper to drive hundreds of miles to buy ingredients, even with spiking gas prices. She's even had to create her own suppliers: the 45-year-old's parents are now growing crops for her business on their Wisconsin property near the Illinois border. Gina Roxas, program coordinator at Trickster Cultural Center in Schaumburg, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, has also agreed to grow Native foods to help the chef minimize costs. When a bag of wild rice costs $20, \"you end up going to a fast food place instead to feed your family,\" Roxas said. More than 70% of Native Americans reside in urban areas - the result of decades of federal policies pushing families to leave reservations and assimilate into American society. Dorene Wiese, executive director of the Chicago-based American Indian Association of Illinois, said members of her community have to prioritize making rent payments over splurging on healthy, traditional foods. Even though specialty chefs like Pamonicutt aim to feed their own communities, the cost of her premium catering service is out of the price range for many urban Natives. Her meals end up feeding majority non-Native audiences at museums or cultural events that can foot the bill, said Wiese, a citizen of the Minnesota White Earth Band of Ojibwe Indians. \"There really is a shortage of Native foods in the area,\" she said, But the problem isn't unique to Chicago. Dana Thompson, co-owner of The Sioux Chef company and executive director of a Minneapolis Indigenous food nonprofit, is another Native businesswoman striving to expand her urban community's access to traditional local foods like lake fish, wild rice and wild greens amid the food price surge. Thompson, of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate and Mdewakanton Dakota people, said inflation is \"really impacting the food systems we have here,\" which include dozens of Indigenous, local and organic food producers. At Owamni, an award-winning Indigenous restaurant under The Sioux Chef umbrella, ingredients like Labrador Tea - which grows wild in northern Minnesota - have been especially difficult to get this year, Thompson said. When an ingredient is not consistently available or affordable, she changes the menu. \"Being fluid and resilient is what we're used to,\" Thompson said. \"That's like the history of indigeneity in North America.\" Inflation is similarly impeding the American Indian Center of Chicago's efforts to improve food security. Executive Director Melodi Serna, of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, said the current prices of food boxes they distribute - with traditional Midwestern foods like fish, bison, venison, dairy products and produce - are \"astronomical.\" \"Where I could have been able to provide maybe 100 boxes, now we're only able to provide 50,\" Serna said. For 57-year-old Emmie King, a Chicago resident and citizen of the Navajo Nation, getting the fresh ingredients she grew up with in New Mexico is much more difficult in the city, especially with inflation biting into her budget. She finds ways to \"stretch\" the food she buys so it lasts longer, purchasing meat in bulk and freezing small portions to add to stews later on. \"I get what I need, rather than what I want,\" she said. But King was able to enjoy a taste of home at an Aug. 3 luncheon at the American Indian Center of Chicago, where twenty elders gathered to enjoy turkey tamales with cranberry-infused masa, Spanish rice with quinoa, elote pasta salad with chickpea noodles and glasses of cold lemonade. The mastermind behind the meal was Pamonicutt herself, sharing her spin on Southwestern and Northern Indigeneous food traditions. Through volunteering at senior lunches and developing a food education program, the chef is continuing to increase access to healthy Indigenous foods in her community. \"I want kids to learn where these foods come from,\" the chef said. \"That whole act of caring for your food ... thanking it, understanding that it was grown to help us survive.\" See all News Updates of the Day Native American News Roundup September 3 - 9, 2023 Here are some Native American-related news stories that made headlines this week: Interior Department cancels Arctic oil and gas leases The Biden-Harris administration announced this week that it will cancel oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) purchased by state developers on the last day of the Trump administration. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Wednesday that the \"lease sale itself was seriously flawed and based on a number of fundamental legal deficiencies.\" \"With today's action, no one will have rights to drill for oil in one of the most sensitive landscapes on Earth,\" Haaland told reporters. \"Climate change is the crisis of our lifetime, and we cannot ignore the disproportionate impacts being felt in the Arctic.\" The administration will also ban new leasing on more than 10 million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, the largest undisturbed public land in the United States. Forty-year fight In 1980, Congress opened 1.5 million acres inside the refuge to oil and gas development. In 2017, Congress passed a tax reform bill authorizing the Interior Department to hold two lease sales by the end of 2024. The state's own economic development arm -- the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) - bought 10-year leases covering more than 174,000 hectares (430,000 acres) of land. The land in question is estimated to hold more than 7 million barrels of oil and 198 billion cubic meters (7 billion cubic feet) of natural gas. In June 2021, the Biden administration put a hold on all drilling, pending an environmental review. AIDEA sued Biden and several other administration officials. \"The lawsuit is in direct response to unlawful actions to obstruct and delay the development of valid oil and gas leases in the non-wilderness Coastal Plain (Section 1002 Area) of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR),\" AIDEA said in a [press release](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AIDEA-v-Biden.pdf) at the time. Last month, a federal judge dismissed the suit. Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy was quick to react to Haaland's announcement this week. \"The leases AIDEA hold in ANWR were legally issued in a sale mandated by Congress. It's clear that President [Joe] Biden needs a refresher on the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. Federal agencies don't get to rewrite laws, and that is exactly what the Department of the Interior is trying to do here,\" he said. AIDAI said it will continue to \"aggressively defend\" its lease rights.

His choice is John Wesley \"Wes\" Nofire, a retired boxer, former member of the Cherokee Nation tribal council and harsh critic of principal chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. In a statement released Tuesday, Stitt's office described Nofire as \"outspoken about the challenges the Supreme Court's McGirt decision has created when it comes to administering justice fairly for every Oklahoman, native and non-native alike.\" In McGirt v. Oklahoma, U.S. Supreme Court justices reviewed the case of a Native American accused of the rape of a 4-year-old Native child on the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. An Oklahoma court sentenced him to two 500-year sentences and life without parole. More than 20 years later, his lawyers appealed, arguing that because Congress had never formally disestablished the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the crime took place on tribal land. They cited the Major Crimes Act, an 1885 law that says when serious crimes are committed by or against a tribal member on tribal or reservation land, only the federal government, not the state, has the right to prosecute. The Supreme Court agreed. Though the ruling applies only to criminal jurisdiction, many in Oklahoma worry it could expand to other areas of law enforcement and beyond into environmental and energy arenas. Hoskin took to [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/chiefhoskin)to condemn Nofire, whose political views are said to align with Stitt's. \"It's difficult to overstate the active threat that Governor Stitt's new Native American Liaison, Wes Nofire, poses to tribal sovereignty,\" he wrote. \"He is on the record opposing tribal sovereignty and peddles dangerous and unhinged conspiracy theories.\" In an interview with Oklahoma's [KOKO-TV](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-governor-stitt-tribes-appointee-relations-backlash/45026469), Nofire sent a message to Hoskin and other critics: \"Give me a little bit more time and allow me to be that olive branch. It grows. That's one thing that they do is when we reach out the hand of opportunity to reach back and let's work on these things, and I think we have a lot of opportunity there,\" Nofire said. Native American News Roundup Aug. 27-Sept. 2, 2023 Here are some Native American-related news stories that made headlines this week: New count of Indian Boarding Schools: 523 and likely growing The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition (NABS) this week released an interactive digital map identifying 523 Indian boarding schools across the United States. That's 115 more than were identified in the [Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Investigative Report of May 2022](https://www.bia.gov/sites/default/files/dup/inline-files/bsi_investigative_report_may_2022_508.pdf) that counted Indian boarding schools operated, funded, or supported by the U.S. government. The [new map](https://boardingschoolhealing.org/interactive-digital-map-of-indian-boarding-schools/) includes both federally operated boarding schools and institutions run by various religious entities. It also identifies known residential schools in Canada. The project has been three years in the works, and the group's Deputy CEO Samuel Torres (Mexica/Nahua) expects more schools will come to light. \"I believe this tool is going to greatly help our relatives who are seeking answers and who are on their own healing journeys,\" he said in a statement. \"Every Indigenous person in this country has been impacted by the deliberate attempt to destroy Native families and cultures through boarding schools. For us to visually see the scope of what was done to our communities and Nations at this scale is overwhelming, but this work is necessary to uncover the truth about this dark chapter in American history.\" [Native News Online](https://nativenewsonline.net/currents/native-american-boarding-school-healing-coalition-launches-interactive-map-of-united-states-523-american-indian-boarding-schools) reports that NABS is hoping to launch a database in November containing nearly 50,000 records collected from boarding and residential schools. Read [more](https://boardingschoolhealing.org/list/): University professor and accused 'pretendian' resigns Andrea Smith, once a well-regarded scholar of Native American studies, has agreed to resign from the University of California at Riverside after more than a decade of [accusations](https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-the-native-american-rachel-dolezal) that she falsely claimed Cherokee identity. VOA obtained a copy of the separation agreement signed by Smith in January 2023 and by university chancellor Kim Wilcox in December 2022. It states that Smith will teach through the summer of 2024 and will then retire as a professor emeritus with the following stipulation: \"Professor Smith agrees that her status as a professor emeritus will not be listed on the university directory information websites.\" In addition, the university will pay her related legal fees up to $5,000. As VOA has [reported previously](https://www.voanews.com/a/native-first-nations-scholars-fake-indians-prevalent-in-higher-education-/6511681.html), Native American scholars say 'race shifting' is prevalent in universities across North America. In a 2022 interview with VOA, Kim TallBear, (Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate) a professor at the University of Alberta, explained why the practice is harmful: \"Non-Indigenous people with non-Indigenous community standpoints who pose as Indigenous and who rise through the professional ranks falsely represent our voices,\" TallBear said. \"They theorize Indigenous peoplehood, sovereignty and anti-colonialism. They become thought leaders, institutional decision-makers and policy advisers to governmental leaders with regulatory and economic power over our peoples and lands.\" Read [more](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-28/uc-riverside-professor-andrea-smith-accused-of-faking-native-american-heritage-resign): Native American Church to Washington: Protect our Peyote The Native American Church of North America (NACNA) will next month hold a second \"boots on the ground\" effort in Washington, calling on federal agencies and lawmakers to help protect peyote from the effects of climate change, corporate agriculture and so-called \"drug tourism.\" \"We will remind federal government agencies that laws established by them in 1978 and 1994\" allow Native American Church member to \"exercise our rights,\" church president Jon Brady posted to members on Peyote is a small, button-shaped cactus that contains psychoactive alkaloids and grows only in southern Texas and parts of northern Mexico.

The new Cherokee Film company will continue sharing the tribe's stories through OsiyoTV and is planning new projects to tell Cherokee stories and boost the revitalization of the Cherokee language. \"Cherokee Nation has quickly become a leading hub for Indigenous storytellers in television and film,\" Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said in a statement. \"As we increase infrastructure, explore incentives, connect resources and remove barriers, Cherokee Nation and its businesses are helping grow and amplify television and film production in Oklahoma while making it possible for our citizens to be a part of it.\" Read [more](https://tribalbusinessnews.com/sections/economic-development/14452-cherokee-nation-launches-cherokee-film-to-become-film-and-media-production-hub): You can watch Cherokee Film's documentary series Osiyo: Voices of the People, [here](https://osiyo.tv/watch-now/): Pacific Northwest tribes welcome Polynesian navigators Hkle'a, a traditional Polynesian deep-sea canoe, is on a four-year voyage around the Pacific Ocean to raise awareness about climate change. The canoe sailed into Elliott Bay in Seattle, Washington, early Wednesday morning, escorted by traditional Suquamish canoes with Muckleshoot and Hawaiian canoes there to greet them. VOA correspondent Natasha Mozgovaya was there and filed this report: Tribal Courts Across US Expanding Holistic Alternatives to Criminal Justice System Inside a jail cell at Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico, Albertyn Pino's only plan was to finish the six-month sentence for public intoxication, along with other charges, and to return to her abusive boyfriend. That's when she was offered a lifeline: An invitation to the tribe's Healing to Wellness Court. She would be released early if she agreed to attend alcohol treatment and counseling sessions, secure a bed at a shelter, get a job, undergo drug testing and regularly check in with a judge. Pino, now 53, ultimately completed the requirements and, after about a year and a half, the charges were dropped. She looks back at that time, 15 years ago, and is grateful that people envisioned a better future for her when she struggled to see one for herself. \"It helped me start learning more about myself, about what made me tick, because I didn't know who I was,\" said Pino, who is now a case manager and certified peer support worker. \"I didn't know what to do.\" The concept of treating people in the criminal justice system holistically is not new in Indian Country, but there are new programs coming on board as well as expanded approaches. About one-third of the roughly 320 tribal court systems across the country have aspects of this healing and wellness approach, according to the National American Indian Court Judges Association. Combining legal advocacy and support Some tribes are incorporating these aspects into more specialized juvenile and family courts, said Kristina Pacheco, Tribal Healing to Wellness Court specialist for the California-based Tribal Law and Policy Institute. The court judges association is also working on pilot projects for holistic defense \u2014 which combine legal advocacy and support \u2014 with tribes in Alaska, Nevada and Oklahoma, modeled after a successful initiative at the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana. \"The thought and the concept will be different from tribe to tribe,\" said Pacheco. \"But ultimately, we all want our tribal people ... to not hurt, not suffer.\" People in the program typically are facing nonviolent misdemeanors, such as a DUI, public intoxication or burglary, she said. Some courts, like in the case of Pino, drop the charges once participants complete the program. A program at the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe in Washington state applies restorative principles and assigns wellness coaches to serve Native Americans and non-Natives in the local county jail, a report released earlier this year by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation outlined. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma has a reintegration program that includes financial support and housing services, as well as cultural programming, career development and legal counsel. In Alaska, the Kenaitze Indian Tribe's wellness court helps adults in tribal and state court who are battling substance abuse and incorporates elements of their tribe's culture. \"There's a lot of shame and guilt when you're arrested,\" said Mary Rodriguez, staff attorney for the court judges association. \"You don't reach out to those resources, you feel that you aren't entitled to those resources, that those are for somebody who isn't in trouble with the law.\" 'You are better than the worst thing you've done' \"The idea of holistic defense is opening that up and reclaiming you are our community member, we understand there are issues,\" Rodriguez said. \"You are better than the worst thing you've done.\" The MacArthur Foundation report outlined a series of inequities, including a complicated jurisdictional maze in Indian Country that can result in multiple courts charging Native Americans for the same offense. The report also listed historical trauma and a lack of access to free, legal counsel within tribes as factors that contribute to disproportionate representation of Native Americans in federal and state prisons. Advocates of tribal healing to wellness initiatives see the approaches as a way to shift the narrative of someone's life and address the underlying causes of criminal activity. There isn't clear data that shows how holistic alternatives to harsh penalization have influenced incarceration rates. Narrative outcomes might be a better measure of success, including regaining custody of one's children and maintaining a driver's license, said Johanna Farmer, an enrolled citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and a program attorney for the court judges association. Some tribes have incorporated specific cultural and community elements into healing, such as requiring participants to interview their own family members to establish a sense of rootedness and belonging. \"You have the narratives, the stories, the qualitative data showing that healing to wellness court, the holistic defense practices are more in line with a lot of traditional tribal community practices,\" Farmer said. \"And when your justice systems align with your traditional values or the values you have in your community, the more likely you're going to see better results.\" While not all of these tribal healing to wellness programs have received federal funding, some have. Between 2020 and 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice distributed more than a dozen awards that totaled about $9.4 million for tribal healing to wellness courts. This year, the Quapaw Nation in Oklahoma started working on a holistic defense program after seeing a sharp increase in cases following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said a large area of eastern Oklahoma remains a Native American reservation. So far this year, about 70 cases have been filed, up from nearly a dozen in all of 2020, said Corissa Millard, tribal court administrator. \"When we look at holistic approaches, we think, 'What's going to better help the community in long term?'\" she said. \"Is sending someone away for a three-year punishment going to be it? Will they reoffend once they get out? Or do you want to try to fix the problem before it escalates?\" For Pino, the journey through Laguna Pueblo's wellness court wasn't smooth. She struggled through relapses and a brief stint on the run before she found a job and an apartment to live in with her son nearby in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her daughters live close by. She largely credits the wellness court staff for her ability to turnaround her life, she said. \"They were the ones that stood by me, regardless of what I was choosing to do; that was the part that brought me a lot of hope,\" she said. \"And now where I'm at, just to see them happy, it gets emotional, because they never let go. They never gave up on me.\" Native American News Roundup Aug. 13-19, 2023 Here are some of the Native American-related stories that made headlines this week: Native Hawaiians missing, dead or displaced by Maui wildfires Native Hawaiians - the Knaka Maoli - are struggling to comprehend the devastation caused by wildfires in Maui, last week.

An estimated 17,000 tribal families live without electricity, most of them in the Southwest and Alaska. The Tribal Electrification Program will provide money and expertise to help tribes electrify homes using environmentally friendly energy sources. It will also help homes that already have electricity switch to cleaner energy options and provide support for home repairs and changes needed to make this happen. The new funding announcement is part of an overall $150 million investment from the Inflation Reduction Act to support the electrification of homes in tribal communities. \"Climate change is the crisis of our lifetimes and has left far too many communities managing for worsening water challenges, extreme heat, devastating wildfires and unprecedented storms.

A well-known champion for Native American rights and sovereignty, Deer grew up on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin. After earning her bachelor's and master's degrees, she worked as a social worker in New York and Wisconsin. In 1954, during the so-called \"Termination Era,\" Congress withdrew its recognition of the Menominee tribe, which meant their lands were now under state control and up for development. It also meant the tribe lost all federal benefits, such as health care and education, and was plunged into poverty. In the early 1970s, Deer and other Menominee supporters launched a grassroots movement \u2014 Determination of Rights and Unity of Menominee Shareholders, or DRUMS \u2014 in protest, and took their case to Washington. \"You don't have to collapse just because there's a federal law in your way. Change it,\" she told The Washington Post in 1973. In late 1973, President Richard Nixon signed the Menominee Restoration Act, reinstating the tribe's protected status and benefits. President Bill Clinton in 1973 appointed her assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Interior Department, overseeing the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

The blocked roads were built on tribal land in the 1960s and are the only route in and out for non-Natives living on the reservation. Land agreements allowing them to use the roads expired in 2013, and negotiations to extend them have so far failed. The Lac du Flambeau Tribal Council says it is owed $20 million for trespassing on its land since the easements expired.

Deer passed away Tuesday evening from natural causes, her godson Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, confirmed on Wednesday. She had entered hospice care last month. Trailblazer, advocate Born August 7, 1935, on the Menominee reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin, Deer is remembered as a trailblazer and fierce advocate for tribal sovereignty. She played a key role in reversing Termination Era policies of the 1950s that took away the Menominee people's federal tribal recognition. \"Ada was one of those extraordinary people who would see something that needed to change in the world and then make it her job and everyone else's job to see to it that it got changed,\" Wikler said. \"She took America from the Termination Era to an unprecedented level of tribal sovereignty.\" Deer was the first member of the Menominee Tribe to graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and went on to become the first Native American to obtain a master's in social work from Columbia University, according to both schools' websites. In the early 1970s, Deer organized grassroots political movements that fought against policies that had rolled back Native American rights. The Menominee Tribe was placed under the control of a corporation in 1961, but Deer's efforts led President Richard Nixon in 1973 to restore the tribe's rights and repeal termination policies. Soon after, Deer was elected head of the Menominee Restoration Committee and began working as a lecturer in American Indian studies and social work at the University of Wisconsin. She unsuccessfully ran twice for Wisconsin's secretary of state and in 1992 narrowly lost a bid to become the first Native American woman elected to U.S. Congress. President Bill Clinton appointed Deer in 1993 as head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, where she served for four years and helped strengthen federal protections and rights for hundreds of tribes. She remained active in academia and Democratic politics in the years before her death and was inducted into the National Native American Hall of Fame in 2019.
