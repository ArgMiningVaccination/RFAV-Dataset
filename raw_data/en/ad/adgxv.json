Hi Crystal, so excited to have you on the platform. So, before we get into questions about your work-life, maybe you can bring our readers up to speed on your story and how you got to where you are today? The seed for Lakewood Community Acupuncture, a 501 (c)3 nonprofit health clinic, was planted on a backpacking trip in June 2016 while sitting around a campfire near Twin Lakes. Jamie and I had become good friends working at another community acupuncture clinic in Denver and we decided to embark on the journey of creating a 501(c)3 with many long hours at Wash Perk coffee shop. We spent months creating Lakewood Community Acupuncture's bylaws and putting together a powerful team of board members to help our nonprofit thrive and impact the community in the best way possible. Fast forward to May of 2018 when LCA first opened their doors. Since then, we have offered low-cost acupuncture treatments of $30-$40 for everyone and provided a financial assistance program of 0-$20 for those who needed further help. We have held donation days for other community nonprofits such as Jeffco Action Center, Family Tree, Jefferson Center for Mental Health, Blue Bench, Art from Ashes, Rose Andom Center, and many others. We host local artists' work in the clinic and allow their art to have a home to be shared while artists receive 100% of the proceeds. We love going out to recreation center events, community events, and customer appreciation days at neighborhood businesses to spread knowledge about holistic health. In March of 2021, we brought on a third acupuncturist, Emily. So, now we have a wonderful team of 3 serving the greater Denver area in whichever way best suits our patients. We offer acupuncture, cupping, estim, reiki, low-level laser therapy, tuina bodywork, herbal medicine, and other healing modalities. We keep our prices affordable with a strong commitment to make healthcare affordable for everyone. Can you talk to us a bit about the challenges and lessons you've learned along the way? Looking back would you say it's been easy or smooth in retrospect? As for many, Covid put a speed bump in the road for Lakewood Community Acupuncture. Jamie and I met with our board members during the closure and discussed ways to continue to provide support to the community. During those two months of closure, we called patients to check-in, held online educational seminars, provided yin yoga and acupressure classes on zoom, mailed out herbs/nutritional supplements/ear seed kits/self-care tools/pain relief plasters, and wrote articles to send to our patients with tips on how to stay healthy. We even were able to have phone appointments and then send details instructions on how to use Tuina bodywork, acupressure points, and food as medicine to help balance the body during the pandemic closure. When we reopened, we shifted to three private treatment rooms and were Covid Safety certified by Jefferson County to make sure we were making sure our clients were safe and comfortable coming back in for their treatments. Great, so let's talk business. Can you tell our readers more about what you do and what you think sets you apart from others? We are the first nonprofit acupuncture clinic in Colorado. We offer low-cost treatments in private treatment rooms (or couples' rooms if you want to come relax with a loved one). We offer acupuncture ($40), cupping, electro-stimulation, low lever laser therapy, reiki, bodywork, motor point e-stim sports acupuncture, ear seeds, herbal medicine, heart sound recorder appointments, and Standard Process nutritional supplements. All herbs and supplements are offered at 25% off retail value to make it more affordable for our patients. Any big plans? We plan on continuing to offer private treatments at community acupuncture prices. We hope to feature more local artists and connect with as many other small businesses in the Denver area to help support and boost up our neighbors. We love what we do and we are grateful for everyone who has contributed to the success of Lakewood Community Acupuncture.
