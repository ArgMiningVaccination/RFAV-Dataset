Medical News Today only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.Our team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we: - Evaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm? - Fact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence? - Assess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices? Certain natural substances have antibacterial properties, including garlic, ginger, and honey. While these may be of benefit as part of a balanced diet, they are not a replacement for prescription medication. Prescription [antibiotics](/articles/10278.php), such as [penicillin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/216798.php), have helped people to recover from otherwise fatal diseases and conditions since the 1940s. However, people are also turning to natural antibiotics for treatment. According to the NHS, [1 in 10 people](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antibiotics/side-effects/) experiences side effects that harm the digestive system after taking antibiotics. Around [1 in 15 people](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antibiotics/side-effects/) are allergic to this type of medication. In this article, we look at the evidence behind seven of the best natural antibiotics. We also discuss which to avoid, and when to see a doctor. The scientific jury is still out concerning natural antibiotics. While people have used remedies like these for hundreds of years, most treatments have not been thoroughly tested. However, some show promising results under medical review, and further studies are underway. With an ongoing increase in drug-resistant bacteria, scientists are looking to nature when developing new medications. Here, we examine the science behind seven natural antibiotics. 1. Garlic Cultures across the world have long recognized garlic for its preventive and curative powers. Research has found that garlic can be [an effective treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103721/) [tuberculosis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8856.php). 2. Honey Since the time of Aristotle, honey has been used as an ointment that helps wounds to heal and prevents or draws out infection. Healthcare professionals today have found it helpful in treating chronic wounds, burns, ulcers, bedsores, and skin grafts. For example, results of a [study from 2016](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/441994) demonstrate that honey dressings can help to heal wounds. The antibacterial effects of honey are usually attributed to its hydrogen peroxide content. However, manuka honey fights off bacteria, though it has a lower hydrogen peroxide content. A 2011 study reported that the best-known type of honey inhibits approximately [60 kinds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/) [MRSA](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/10634.php)). Antibacterial properties aside, honey may help wounds to heal by providing a protective coating that fosters a moist environment. 3. Ginger The scientific community also recognizes [ginger](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/265990.php) as a natural antibiotic. Several studies, including one published in [2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486105/) Researchers are also exploring ginger's power to combat seasickness and nausea and to lower blood sugar levels. 4. Echinacea Native American and other traditional healers have used [echinacea](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/252684.php) for hundreds of years to treat infections and wounds. Researchers are beginning to understand why. [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3205674/) S. pyogenes is responsible for [strep throat](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/155412.php), toxic and the \"flesh-eating disease\" known as [necrotizing fasciitis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7884.php). Echinacea may also fight [inflammation](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248423.php) associated with bacterial infection. It is available to purchase in health stores or [online](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Echinacea&i=aps&tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null). 5. Goldenseal Goldenseal is usually consumed in tea or capsules to treat respiratory and digestive problems. However, it may also combat bacterial [diarrhea](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158634.php) and [urinary tract infections](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/189953.php). In addition, results of a [recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4527992/) A person taking prescription medications should check with a doctor before taking goldenseal, as this supplement can cause interference. Goldenseal also contains berberine, an important component of natural antibiotics. This alkaloid is not safe for infants, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Goldenseal capsules are available to purchase in health stores or [online](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=goldenseal&i=aps&tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null). 6. Clove Clove has traditionally been used in dental procedures. Research is now finding that clove water extract [may be effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486105/) 7. Oregano Some believe that oregano boosts the immune system and acts as an [antioxidant](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506.php). It may have anti-inflammatory properties. While researchers have yet to verify these claims, some studies show that oregano is among the [more effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486105/) Just because something is labeled natural, it is not necessarily safe. The amounts and concentrations of active ingredients vary among brands of supplements. Read labels carefully. A person should also inform their healthcare provider if they plan to take these supplements. While cooked garlic is usually safe to consume, research suggests that taking concentrated garlic may [increase](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/garlic/ataglance.htm) Garlic concentrates may also reduce the usefulness of [HIV](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/17131.php) medications. Certain products should be avoided, including colloidal silver. This substance consists of microscopic pieces of silver suspended in water. Colloidal silver has been recommended as a treatment for a variety of diseases, including the bubonic plague and HIV. However, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, it can be dangerous, and [no credible studies](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/silver) Taking colloidal silver supplements may interfere with the effectiveness of antibiotics and medication used to treat an underactive thyroid gland. Silver can also build up in the body and turn the skin bluish-gray. This condition is called argyria and is permanent in most people. Due to the current increase in drug-resistant diseases, most doctors do not prescribe antibiotics unless they are effective and necessary. Antibiotics are most often prescribed to: - prevent the spread of infectious diseases - prevent a condition from becoming more serious or fatal - speed recovery from illness or injury - prevent development of complications If a person is prescribed antibiotics, they should take the entire dosage as directed. This is especially encouraged in people with a higher risk of bacterial infection, or who face greater risks if they become ill, such as people who are: - scheduled for surgery - receiving [chemotherapy](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158401.php) - HIV-positive - taking [insulin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/whatisinsulin.php)for [diabetes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/) - living with [heart failure](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/156849.php) - recovering from serious wounds - over 75 years old - under 3 days old When an individual is allergic to prescription antibiotics or suffers side effects, they may want to discuss other options with a doctor. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each year more than [2 million](https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf#page=6) These bacteria constitute a growing threat, and the key to developing new and effective medications may lie in treatments of the past \u2014 natural antibiotics. While natural antibiotics may present opportunities, they also carry risks. Still, research into these treatments is growing, and an increasing number of substances are being tested. Natural antibiotics traditionally used for centuries may contribute to the lifesaving drugs of tomorrow. "}
