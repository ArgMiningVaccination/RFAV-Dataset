The simplest answer, of course, would be that we adjust the back and spine. However, there's actually much more to it than that. A Galloway, OH chiropractor discusses the basics of chiropractic treatment below. Basics Let's start with the basics. Chiropractic adjustments are centered around the manipulation of joints. The practice is based on the study of the close relationship between the spine and the nervous system. To quote fitness guru Denise Austin: \"Your spine is your lifeline.\" The chiropractor applies pressure to the joint in a specific way, using either their hands or a special instrument. These adjustments help realign joints, relieve stiffness and pain, improve and/or restore range of motion, and release tension. Custom Care Many medical treatments work best in conjunction with other treatments. It's not uncommon for chiropractors to incorporate other non-invasive therapies, such as cold therapy, stretching exercises, and massage. It really just depends on what the user needs. Ask your chiropractor for specific advice. How It Helps Chiropractic care is most commonly used to treat back pain, neck pain, and headaches. However, it can also help treat many other conditions, including Crohn's disease, repetitive injuries, sports injuries, scoliosis, pregnancy-related joint pain, asthma, and even infertility, to name just a few. Ask your chiropractor for more information. Benefits One of the best benefits about chiropractic is the fact that it is extremely safe. It is completely non-invasive, and doesn't require any drugs. There's no aftercare required, though you may want to plan for a relaxing night in after your session. Many people report feeling immediate relief after treatment. If you've ever dealt with the excruciating pain in your back or neck, you can understand the appeal of that! Risks As mentioned above, chiropractic care has a stellar safety record. The risk of complication is very low, though not entirely non-existent. That said, no health care service is going to be right for everyone. Chiropractic should not be performed on patients with certain conditions or symptoms, such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, numbness or tingling in the arms or legs, or high risk of stroke. Also, only go to a chiropractor that is fully trained and licensed. Do you want to learn more about chiropractic treatments? Contact us, your Galloway, OH chiropractic "}
