Introduction [1](#B1-molecules-21-00559), [2](#B2-molecules-21-00559)]. The use of natural products as medicines must, of course, have presented a tremendous challenge to early humans. It is highly probable that when seeking food, early humans often consumed poisonous plants, which led to vomiting, diarrhea, coma, or other toxic reactions\u2014perhaps even death. However, in this way, early humans were able to develop knowledge about edible materials and natural medicines [ [3](#B3-molecules-21-00559)]. Subsequently, humans invented fire, learned how to make alcohol, developed religions, and made technological breakthroughs, and they learned how to develop new drugs. [2](#B2-molecules-21-00559), [4](#B4-molecules-21-00559)]. [5](#B5-molecules-21-00559)]. Now TCM still plays an important role in China, and it is constantly being developed. TCM is based on 5000 years of medical practice and experience, and is rich in data from \"clinical experiments\" which guarantee its effectiveness and efficacy. It has developed techniques with respect to such areas as correct dosage, methods of preparing and processing materials, and the appropriate time to collect the various medicinal parts of plants. It is notable that there is increasing convergence between TCM and modern medicine. With the development of modern technology, it has become possible to determine the pharmacology and mechanisms of action of many Chinese herbs, and TCM has become comprehensible in terms of modern medicine [ [6](#B6-molecules-21-00559), [7](#B7-molecules-21-00559), [8](#B8-molecules-21-00559), [9](#B9-molecules-21-00559)]. With advances in the theoretical background, therapeutic principles, associated technologies, and understanding of the life sciences, a clearer understanding of the active compounds of TCM has become possible [ [5](#B5-molecules-21-00559)]. [10](#B10-molecules-21-00559), [11](#B11-molecules-21-00559)]. Subsequently, countless active compounds have been separated from natural products. Among them, some follow their traditional uses and the others do not. Later, the development of synthetic techniques led to a significant reduction in the importance of natural products, and there were concerns that the use of some natural products for medicinal purposes might be completely banned. However, natural products are important for the development of new drugs, and these products have been in constant use. Some type of medicines, such as anticancer, antihypertensive, and antimigraine medication, have benefited greatly from natural products [ [10](#B10-molecules-21-00559), [13](#B13-molecules-21-00559), [14](#B14-molecules-21-00559)]. [15](#B15-molecules-21-00559)]. 2. Natural Products [16](#B16-molecules-21-00559), [17](#B17-molecules-21-00559), [18](#B18-molecules-21-00559)]. From the past century, the high structural diversity of natural products have been realized from the perspective of physical chemistry. Their efficacy is related to the complexity of their well-organized three-dimensional chemical and steric properties, which offer many advantages in terms of efficiency and selectivity of molecular targets. As a successful example of drug development from natural products, artemisinin and its analogs are presently in wide use for the anti-malaria treatment. This shows how research using natural products has made a significant contribution in drug development [ [19](#B19-molecules-21-00559), [20](#B20-molecules-21-00559)]. [12](#B12-molecules-21-00559), [21](#B21-molecules-21-00559)]. During the period between 1981 and 2002, the application of natural products in the development of new drugs\u2014especially in the search for novel chemical structures\u2014showed conspicuous success. In that 22-year time frame, drugs derived from natural products have been significant. That is especially true in the case of antihypertensives, where about 64% of newly-synthesized drugs have their origins in natural product structures [ [12](#B12-molecules-21-00559)]. [14](#B14-molecules-21-00559), [22](#B22-molecules-21-00559), [23](#B23-molecules-21-00559)]. For example, plants, microorganisms, and animals manufacture small molecules, which have played a major role in drug discovery. Among 69 small-molecule new drugs approved from 2005 to 2007 worldwide, 13 were natural products or originated from natural products, which underlines the importance of such products in drug research and development [ [12](#B12-molecules-21-00559), [13](#B13-molecules-21-00559)]. [13](#B13-molecules-21-00559)]. Therefore, there is great potential for future discoveries from plants and other natural products which, thus, offer huge potential in deriving useful information about novel chemical structures and their new types of action related to new drug development. 3. Traditional Medicines [24](#B24-molecules-21-00559), [25](#B25-molecules-21-00559)]. [26](#B26-molecules-21-00559), [27](#B27-molecules-21-00559)]. It should be noted that in TCM, several herbs and ingredients are combined according to strict rules to form prescriptions, which are referred to as formulas (fang ji in Chinese). Commonly, a classic formula is composed of four elements\u2014the \"monarch\", \"minister\", \"assistant\", and \"servant\"\u2014according to their different roles in the formula, each of which consists of one to several drugs. Ideally, these drugs constitute an organic group to produce the desired therapeutic effect and reduce adverse reactions [ [28](#B28-molecules-21-00559)]. [29](#B29-molecules-21-00559)]. A recent study has found that some physicians in Japan use Kampo medicines in their daily practice\u2014sometimes as the preferred medication [ [29](#B29-molecules-21-00559), [30](#B30-molecules-21-00559), [31](#B31-molecules-21-00559)]. Together with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, some Japanese physicians frequently utilize Kampo medicines in treating cancer patients. This indicates how modern Western medicine can be well integrated with TM [ [30](#B30-molecules-21-00559), [32](#B32-molecules-21-00559)]. As the use of Kampo continues to rise in conjunction with Western medicine, there is growing realization of the urgent need to study the interactions between these two types of medicines [ [28](#B28-molecules-21-00559)]. [33](#B33-molecules-21-00559)]. Since the mid-1970s, when the WHO began to place a greater focus on TM, Unani has attracted considerable attention all over the world, especially in India, where it has been integrated into the national health care system [ [34](#B34-molecules-21-00559)]. [35](#B35-molecules-21-00559)]. The current status of TM differs in different countries. In 2012, the total value of the TCM industry was equivalent to around one-third of the total for China's pharmaceutical industry [ [36](#B36-molecules-21-00559)]. It has been determined that 80% of the population in Africa makes use of TM\u2014either alone or in conjunction with conventional medicine [ [37](#B37-molecules-21-00559)]. By contrast, traditional Aboriginal medicine in Australia is in danger of vanishing owing to the prevalence of conventional medicine [ [38](#B38-molecules-21-00559)]. In the case of Israel with its ethnic diversity, modern medicine is prevailing, and TM is declining [ [39](#B39-molecules-21-00559)]. Many practitioners of Western medical science think such TM systems as being short of reliability; however, they are adopted by the majority of people in the world [ [35](#B35-molecules-21-00559)]. It is possible to produce remarkable synergy and yield great benefits in developing reformed medicines and new drugs by connecting powerful modern scientific techniques and methods with the reasonable ethnobotanical and ethnomedical experiences of TM. Characteristics of several TM systems are summarized in [Table 1](#molecules-21-00559-t001). 4. Drugs Developed from Traditional Medicines that Follow the Traditional Uses [35](#B35-molecules-21-00559)]. It is notable that a lot of plant-originated drugs in clinical medicine today were derived from TM [ [21](#B21-molecules-21-00559)]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the many valuable drugs derived from plants were discovered through their application in TM [ [2](#B2-molecules-21-00559)]. [2](#B2-molecules-21-00559)]. [13](#B13-molecules-21-00559)]. As noted above, artemisinin and other antimalarial drugs are examples of modern drugs based on TMs. Early in China's Jin Dynasty, Doctor Hong Ge (AD 284-384) recorded the efficacy and related details of Artemisia annua L. in treating malaria in his book Zhou Hou Bei Ji Fang. That is the earliest record anywhere of treating malaria with Artemisia annua L., and it shows that Chinese physicians 1700 years ago had reached a sophisticated level of medical treatment [ [53](#B53-molecules-21-00559), [54](#B54-molecules-21-00559)]. [55](#B55-molecules-21-00559)]. antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine, in that it has a novel structure, with a sesquiterpene lactone bearing a peroxy group, and it does not contain nitrogen heterocycles. Compared with previous antimalarial drugs, artemisinin has the merit of high efficiency, quick effect, and low toxicity. Artemisinin is effective in treating various forms of malaria, such as falciparum and cerebral malaria, which are resistant to chloroquine, and its mechanism of action is different from traditional antimalarial drugs. The discovery of artemisinin was a great success for TCM at a special period in China's history, and it was achieved through a well-organized team of hundreds of researchers [ [56](#B56-molecules-21-00559)]. Since that breakthrough, scientists have conducted comprehensive research in such areas as pharmaceutical chemistry, organic synthetic chemistry, and chemical biology. Through etherification and esterification, they have produced a series of well-known new drugs, such as artemether and artesunate. Those drugs have improved efficacy and solubility, which are of benefit for patients receiving oral or intravenous administration and have overcome the high parasite recrudescence rate and low solubility of artemisinin [ [55](#B55-molecules-21-00559), [56](#B56-molecules-21-00559), [57](#B57-molecules-21-00559)]. Most importantly, one of these scientists, Youyou Tu, was just awarded the 2015 Nobel Medicine Prize for her significant devotion in discovering artemisinin. [56](#B56-molecules-21-00559)]. Some drugs or compounds isolated from Chinese herbal medicines which follow the ethnomedical uses are summarized in [Table 2](#molecules-21-00559-t002). 5. Drugs Developed from Natural Products [57](#B57-molecules-21-00559)]. [72](#B72-molecules-21-00559)]. Pharmacological results of bicyclol showed antifibrotic and hepatoprotective effects against liver injury and liver fibrosis induced by CCl4 or other hepatotoxins in mice and rats; it also exhibited the antihepatitis virus effect in the 2.2.15 cell line and duck model with viral hepatitis [ [73](#B73-molecules-21-00559), [74](#B74-molecules-21-00559)]. [75](#B75-molecules-21-00559)]. Compared with previous anti-hepatitis drugs, bicyclol exhibited a more consolidated effect after the drug was discontinued; the rebound rate was low, with fewer adverse reactions and higher oral bioavailability [ [76](#B76-molecules-21-00559)]. Based on previous studies in such areas as synthesis, pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, preparation, and quality control, researchers determined that the new antihepatitis drug bicyclol offered significant hepatoprotective effects, antihepatitis virus activity, and fewer adverse reactions [ [57](#B57-molecules-21-00559)]. Bicyclol has been approved for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis in China since 2004 [ [73](#B73-molecules-21-00559)]. Bicyclol has independent intellectual property rights and belongs to Class 1 of China's New Chemical Drug. The drug is one of the anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective drugs recommended by the \"Guidelines on Liver Disease Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment\" in China, and it has been exported to many countries [ [57](#B57-molecules-21-00559), [76](#B76-molecules-21-00559)]. [77](#B77-molecules-21-00559), [78](#B78-molecules-21-00559), [79](#B79-molecules-21-00559)]. Some drugs or compounds isolated or developed from natural products are summarized in [Table 3](#molecules-21-00559-t003). 6. Discussion [89](#B89-molecules-21-00559)]. This will enhance the possibilities for individual treatment and prevention of disease. Humankind needs to learn more from natural products and traditional medicines.
