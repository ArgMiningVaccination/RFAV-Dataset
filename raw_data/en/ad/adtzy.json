The symptoms of methanol poisoning include severe abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis with rapid, shallow breathing and visual disturbances which may proceed to irreversible blindness. Other symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weakness, vertigo, ataxia, mild tachycardia, confusion, dizziness, delirium and coma which in severe cases may terminate in death due to respiratory failure or rarely in circulatory collapse. Management of industrial methylated spirit poisoning Recent ingestion should be treated by gastric lavage with sodium bicarbonate solution 2-5%, together with treatment for shock and respiratory failure. Acidosis should be corrected with intravenous sodium bicarbonate or compound sodium lactate. Delirium if it occurs may be treated with diazepam. If significant amounts of methyl alcohol have been ingested, early treatment with an antidote (ethanol or fomepizole) is recommended. In severe cases haemodialysis may be effective. Treatment should not be stopped prematurely since oxidation and excretion of methyl alcohol may continue for several days; patients should, therefore, be closely observed and monitored.
