This isalso aproposal inwhich, atleast without further modification, errors accumulate through successive stages. Toavoid that, logic devices must continually restandardize signals, i.e. push thesignal levelbacktoward favored and thedeflection produced byparticle collisions. Thisscheme, inunmodified form, requires perfect mirror placement andexact initial velocities. Consider, instead, a modified version inwhich theparticles move along guiding tracks areviscous, andalsoexpose continuation oftheoriginal track andabranching track, offatsome angle. (There arealsocompensating inverse branches, bringing tracks together, just asintheunmodified scheme [20].)Wealsoinvoke (asFredkin does, insome versions ofthismodel) moving potential wells, i.e.time fields, which pace theparticles intheir motion along thetracks. Lettwoadjoining tracks have forks atadjoining positions, along their lengths. Then ifaparticle arrives along onlyoneofthetracks itwill continue undisturbed. Iftwo particles arrive simultaneously, they willrepel andmove into their respective branching tracks.

Due tospace limitations, onrelatively simple devices operating near equi- librium. Foragood review including much fascinating work inmore complicated systems, seeVanderZiel [4]. With rare exceptions [6]thevoltage noise appears toresult directly from resistance fluctuations which arepresent without current. VanderZiel hasreviewed theevidence with anexternal bath orexchange onesign such andextrinsic semiconductors, neutrality essentially eliminates thefirst mechanism, sothat significant carrier number fluctuations require trapping states. Inmany metal film andsemiconductor samples, resistance fluctuations have been found described byHooge's gives <(6R) /R> with thenumber ofcarriers, thepossibility that the1/fnoise results from trap occupation fluctuations. Each independent trap contributes anamount p(l-p) tothemean square fluctuations, where pistheoccupation probability, asforthevariance inanytwo state system.

Partially occupied traps imply temperature found innoisy samples, although there seems tohave been little effort tofind them. Thus itisunlikely that samples obeying equation (1)orhaving more noise areshowing simple number fluctuations. This restriction applies regardless of whether thetraps are anatural Aswith anynumber metals andinmany semiconductors. P.H.Handel andcoworkers have calculations indicate that interference waves Tremblay, ofthewave itself exhibits 1/ffluctuations asthe current density. Thus Iconsider these theories tobenumber fluctuation theories. This isnotsurprising, since thetheory explicitly neglects anymomentum difference between the elastic andinelastic wave. However, theintegral over [3]have proposed that equation (1)applies toallhomogeneous materials, with theconductivity fluctuations resulting from independent fluctuations of themability ofeach carrier. This formulation hassince been modified result. ofcarriers thecarriers there arearange attempts toshow that themagnitude oftheHall effect noise fits such a model even better than asimple number fluctuation model [22] have been this experiment used point-contact resistors onecannot completely exclude thepossibility that surface effects were involved, inwhich case different spatial weighting patterns forheat flow andelectrical current could give arelatively ofcoherence. Despite itspopularity theindependent carrier model onsimple grounds. Theexplanations oftheHall effect andthermoelec- tric noise would impossible ifeach carrier fluctuated independently [27]. Furthermore, 1/fnoise in samples with carrier transit times inthemicrosecond tomillisecond range looks nodif- ferent from that intherelatively rare samples with longer transit times. Obviously low frequency fluctuations arenottied toindividual carriers which hang around forless ofthenumerical prefactor some surface than twoorders smaller than relation (1)would predict. Inoneofthebest known measurements ofvery low frequency excess noise inGe,thefrequency dependence was f\"^*\"^, which obviously cannot agree with equation There isonewell-known mechanism, loosely referred toastemperature fluctuations, which does cause mobility fluctuations. Voss andClarke [7]obtained evidence that the1/f noise inmetal films results fluctuations. Theprincipal evidence due toequilibrium temperature fluctuations andthe Green's fortheresistance charge produced byJoule heating [32,33,34]. This relation hasbeen confirmed heating. Except formaterials with exceptionally large values of3X,nR/9J!.nT, spontaneous temperature fluctuation noise isalways small compared with Nyquist noise. In those systems where spontaneous temperature fluctuations have been observed, ithasnothad a1/fform. Very lowfrequency temperature fluctuations associated with thethermostat rather thesample have also been observed data obtained inapoint-contact sample which might exhibit surface effects.

Toavoid these trapped arefast compared with intraband scattering; andsecond, scattering were notneglected. Inview ofthis, Ishall not consider other difficulties with themodel. SURFACE EFFECTS Avery substantial amount ofexperimental evidence, well summarized byVanderZiel, indicates inthick metal experiments involve similar surfaces andsurface tovolume ratios. McWhorter proposed that number fluctuations cause 1/fnoise [1]. The1/fspectrum maybepredicted asanatural consequence ofa tunneling rate distribution oftraps inathick oxide thus appeats from simple, almost first-principles considerations rather than from ad-hoc constructions. Unfortunately, experimental data generally indicate that almost anysurface treatment affects themagnitude ofthe1/fnoise without changing itself, surface adhocassumptions. Onepiece ofexperimental data shows signs ofpreferential theboundary-condition fluctuating netsurface charges orfluctuating patterns ofsurface charge could produce significant mobility fluctuations. Afluctuating pattern ofsurface charges would produce fluctuating interference terms intheCoulomb scattering, analogous totheflicker pattern scattering cross section isInherently wave vector dependent andhence could give some oftheexperimental results which require multiparameter fluctuations.

Reasonable, ifnotairtight, precautions against contact noise were taken. The whiskers have less surface area andmany less defects than thefilms. Notheory appears to begin toexplain these results. WEIGHTING FUNCTION SINGULARITIES Ithaslong been known [55] that diffusion [57,58]. sixdecades of1/fnoise. Very fewplausible geometries give more than about decades bysuch amechanism. Thesingularity theory predicts that theW(r) singularities which give 1/fnoise for diffusion will also dosoforother fluctuation transport mechanisms [58]. Thetheory has been confirmed inasomewhat contrived experimental arrangement inwhich light scatterers were flowed past number fluctuations would give 1/fresistance fluctuation inabout theright frequency range, but with amagnitude slightly lower than thesmallest found. They would notgive noise concentration-cell voltage. However, electrophoresis ordiffusion twoorders ofmagnitude from the prediction of[20]) of1/fnoise inlong pores filled with meticulously filtered solutions [60] supports this interpretation. Sodoes other, theeffect scaling inversely with distance. Asaresult onemaypredict 1/fnoise over about bygating mechanisms with arange ofactivation energies [62,63]. Nevertheless, this case remains interesting because the1/fprediction follows directly from well known fundamental features ofthesystem, andwith noadjustable inmetals might give 1/fnoise directly through singular defect-defect interaction terms. However, inthree dimensions therequired singularity would have anr~'functional form, which does correspond toanything Iknow of.

However, forsubstrate supported metal films various theoretical temperature fluctuation models predict spectra with alowfrequency cutoff, a limited 1/frange, ifany, andamonotonic temperature dependence. formost in metal films. Voss proposed athermal fluctuation model with a1/fregime [1] ofametal film onaninsulating substrate with a uniform surface noise source having awhite spectrum spatially coherent across thetopof thesubstrate would yield a1/fspectrum [6].

Inthespring of1979, three groups reported successful mixing experiments using thesharp quasiparticle nonlinearity insmall area SIS tunnel junctions [9,10,11]. Since that time, substantial progress hasbeen made toward utilizing photon-assisted tunneling asatechnique forapproaching quantum noise limited detection inthemillimeter wave region. THEORY ofquanta inthetunneling process. Equation (2)provides la. duetothebias current. Heterodjme detection maybeutilized, however, toapproach quantum noise limited sensitivity. Photon-assisted tunneling theory makes thefollowing major predictions for suchheterodyne mixers under appropriate operating conditions [12]: (1) .Quantum noise limited mixer temperatures: T^^~\"Rw/k. (2) .Conversion toonly afewdegrees Kelvin inthemillimeter wave region, noise from amplifiers following themixer would otherwise dominate thetotal receiver temperature. Modest amounts ofconversion gain, however, will reduce these amplifier noise contributions sufficiently thatquantum noise limited performance maybeapproached inpractical re- ceivers. Thetheory also predicts that very large conversion gain associated with anega- tive output impedance maybeobtained under certain conditions. EXPERIMENT Theinitial experiments onSISquasiparticle mixers [9,10,11] allreported very ~6-10 db. These re- sults were comparable tothose previously with thesuper-Schottky diodes, except thatdistinct evidence ofquantum effects duetophoton-assisted tunneling work onSISheterodyne mixers hasproduced dramatic improvements. The Caltech-Bell Labs group hasconstructed complete 115GHzastronomical receivers thatare already competitive with thebest available cooled Schottky diode instruments [14].

Webelieve this discrepancy arises from self-heating inthejunction, which increases themagnitude ofthenoise atthemeasurement frequency. andpredicted resonances aremisaligned, indicating that ourchoices ofLgandC were slightly incorrect.
