This is the only way you'll be successful in recovery and in helping your doctor optimize your health. Path to improved health Each person's recovery process is different. Some people may be able to take medicines, and others may not.

You may want to find a self-help support group to help with depression. Your doctor can suggest groups in your area. Also, let your doctor know if you're a part of a group.
