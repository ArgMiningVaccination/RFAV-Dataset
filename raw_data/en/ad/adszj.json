The *story*: Not long after creating the rainbow flag, Gilbert Baker had a problem. The group running an early community center told him that since he'd worked on it at the Center, the flag belonged to the group, which was going to apply to copyright and trademark it. He went to see Matt Coles, now a Professor at UC Law SF, then a recent Hastings grad who'd hung out a shingle on Castro Street. Coles assumed Baker wanted the rights for himself. No, Baker said, he didn't want anyone to own the flag; it should belong to the world. Coles took the case, and succeeded in getting the group to back off with a couple of letters. Baker couldn't pay, but Coles didn't mind since the point was to make the flag available to everyone. But about 30 years later, Baker showed up at Coles' office at the ACLU in New York with a gift: a signed copy of the original flag, with all 8 colors. It's in Professor Coles' office at UC Law SF now. #pride #sfpride2019 #sfpride #pride2019 #generationsofresistance #lgbtq #rainbowflag A post shared by UC Law SF (@uchastingslaw) on Jun 27, 2019 at 2:51pm PDT CAMPUS: UC Law SF's Academic Village is moving forward, and Globe St. wrote about its development. http://bit.ly/2LvFF52 Congressman Jimmy Gomez (CA-34) on June 5 introduced the Jeanette Acosta Invest in Women's Health Act.
