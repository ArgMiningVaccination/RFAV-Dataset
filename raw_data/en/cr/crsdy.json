(vid. app. crit.) seems to have been the usual reading at the end of the fourth century (cf. Duris of Samos, fr. 57, F. H. G. ii. 482). to be intended to reconcile the two traditions. The Alexandrine librarians, however, must have had good reasons for restoring *(alik. in the text. (For H.'s birth, &c., cf. inquiry' (ii. 99. 1); only once in H.='history' (vii. 96. 1) in the modern sense. Croiset (Litt. Grec. ii. 589) well says that the word 'marks a literary revolution'; the logogra/foi had written down the current stories, the historian sets out to 'find' the truth. The reason given for writing is characteristic of H.; he is the born chronicler, and his interest is in the past: Thucydides (i. 22. 4) is the scientific historian, and his eye is on e)/rga. oi( lo/gioi (= 'skilled in history') cf. ii. 3. 1. H.'s story is decidedly Greek, and not Persian, in colouring: cf. vi. 54; vii. 150. 2 for a like (supposed) Persian acquaintance with Greek myths; a similar knowledge is attributed to the Egyptians ii. 91. 5. Such combinations certainly come from Greek sources, not native ones. *foi/nikas. The name (whence Lat. 'Poenus') seems to be pure Greek; it certainly occurs in places where there is no trace of foreign influence; e. g. the harbour *foinikou=s, near Erythrae (Thuc. viii. 34), a stream near Thermopylae, &c. (Meyer, ii. 92). As applied to a race, it may well be a colour name, 'Red men'; cf. *ai)qi/oy and 'White Syrians' (6. 1 n.). This derivation, however, is not inconsistent with it being also a foreign name. The old connexion with 'Fenchu', supposed to occur at Karnak in the inscriptions of Thothmes III, is now given up; others see in the name the Egyptian 'Punt', the land of South Arabia and East Africa. This last is the view of E. Gl\u00e4ser, Punt und die S\u00fcdarabischen Reiche (1899), who holds that from this 'original home' (p. 62) the Phoenicians spread both north (v. i.) and south to Mashonaland and Socotra; he says (p. 65) the gods of Phoenicia can be almost all easily recognized as South Arabian. This derivation would agree with the legend of their migration from the shores of the Indian Ocean (vii. 89. 2), which first occurs here; for a later version cf. Strabo, 766 (based on Androsthenes, a seaman of Alexander), who says that the islands of Tyros (v. l. Tylos) and Arados (hod. Bahrein) in the Persian Gulf claimed to be the mother cities of the Phoenician towns; he elsewhere (35) rejects the story. Justin (xviii. 3) actually professes to give their route when migrating: for a discussion of these passages cf. Maspero, ii. 63 seq., who accepts the general fact of the migration from the south-east, and dates it soon after 3000 B. C., on the evidence of ii. 44. 3. General probability confirms this northwest movement of the Semitic peoples, though Meyer (i. 356) rejects the whole story. The position of the Phoenicians, wedged in on the narrow strip of coast, shows they were the earliest among the Semitic migrants (cf. the position of the Celtic peoples in Wales, Brittany, &c.). But beyond this all is uncertain. *)eruqrh=s qala/sshs (cf. ii. 8. 1 et pass.). H. means by this all the water south-east and south of Asia; our 'Red Sea' was its western limit, and has the special name of *)ara/bios ko/lpos (ii. 102. 2 et pass.); beyond it to the south-west lay h( noti/h qa/lassa (iv. 42. 3); the Persian Gulf proper has no special name in H. (cf. i. 180. 1, where the Euphrates runs into the *(eruqrh\\ qa/lassa). The name 'Red Sea' is Egyptian, and is derived perhaps from the colour of the sand. The pre-eminence of Argos in early times is an inference from Homer, and even more from the Cyclic poems, e.g. the Thebais and the Epigoni (cf. v. 67 n.). Hellas did not obtain its name till after the Dorian invasion (cf. i. 58 nn.). fo/rton. For the scene here muri/) a)/gontes was the daughter of Inachus was the usual form of the legend (cf. Apollod. ii. 1. 3; F. H. G. i. 125; who gives two other forms). The cow-headed 10 of Argos is another form of Hera (cf. Homeric epithet bow=pis; but see Farnell G. C. i. 16), and represents the cow-goddess of an early race; this animal-worship was not understood, and so was explained by a myth. Io, whose descendant, Danaus, migrates from Egypt to Argos, was identified with Isis; the identification was probably due in part to similarity of name, in part to the resemblance of the horned maiden, Io, to Hathor-Isis (see ii. 41. 1 n.). This identification may be subsequent to the foundation of Naucratis, but more probably belongs to Mycenaean times. H. rationalizes the old myths into plain matter of fact (cf. ii. 56-7 for the similar treatment of the myth of Dodona and Intr. \u00a7 26). The usual Greek myth (not in H.) was that Io was turned into a heifer, and wandered till she came to Egypt, where she bore Epaphus (Apis; cf. ii. 38. 1 n.). basile/os. Homer calls him 'Phoenix' (Il. xiv. 321), but H. gives the usual form 'Agenor' (iv. 147. 4; in vi. 47. 1 we must translate *qa/sou tou= 'Thasus the Phoenician'). *krh=tes. This is H.'s own suggestion; the usual form of the legend was that Europa bore Minos and Rhadamanthus to Zeus in Crete; he means that, if this were properly interpreted, it would agree with the Persian version here told; 'these would then be Cretans.' The words tau=ta me\\n ktl. imply that the balance of criminality now was equal; hence the Greeks were really to blame for the next act of aggression. makrh=|. 'A ship of war' is emphatic; it was an organized raid. ta)=lla: i. e. the winning of the Golden Fleece. deute/rh|: translate 'the next generation'; the children of the Argonauts took part in the Trojan War. H. counts inclusively. nomi/zein, 'they (i. e. the Persians) thought.' a)noh/twn. H. probably saw the humour of this argument; but this part of his history gave offence. It was parodied by Aristophanes (Achar. 524 seq. e)k the Peloponnesian War; and 'Plutarch' (de Malig. 11) is very angry at the 'passive resistance' imputed to the much-respected Io, and that 'the fairest and greatest exploit of Greece, the Trojan War, should be put down as a)belteri/a' ('fatuity'). For other parodies of H. cf. Achar. 82-6 with 133. 1 and 192. 1; Av. 552 and 1124 seq. with 179. 1 (Babylon), Av. 1130 with ii. 127. 1 (measurement of pyramid), Av. 1142 seq. with ii. 136. 4, Nub. 273 with ii. 25 and (perhaps) Av.488 with vii.14. These references prove how soon the work of H. became well known. (See Note B, p. 448.) *)asi/hn. For the Persian claim to Asia cf. ix. 116. 3. e)qelonth/n. For this form of the story cf. Od. xv. 420 seq. e)peciw/n: translate 'dealing with'. The phrase used (with which cf. oratione obire), the reference to Od. i. a)/stea, suggest the author's wide travels. H.'s religious feeling shows itself at once; he desires not only to record men's 'great deeds', but to show the instability of human fortune (cf. c. 32 nn.). The idea was a commonplace with the Ionian Xenophanes a)ei\\ d' e)n tau)tw=| mi/mnei kinou/menon ou)de/n (R. and P. p. 84), and with the Greeks generally, e. g. Soph. Trach. 132 seq. The Lydian history (of course, with digressions, especially cc. 56-68). H. ignores the upper course of the Halys, where it flows from north-east to south-west; it was its lower course which formed the boundary of the Lydian Empire; cf. c. 72 for a fuller account of it. By 'Syrians' H. means the North Cappadocians (i. 72. 1), called by Strabo (542, 737) also 'the White Syrians', in contrast to the darker Syrians of the Levant. Some have distinguished *su/rioi (= 'Cappadocians') from *su/roi (= 'the inhabitants of Palestine'), but the variety of spelling seems due merely to copyists. The name is probably a corruption of 'Assyrian'; H. (vii. 63) actually uses it of the Assyrians, and says 'Syrian' is the Greek, 'Assyrian' the barbarous form. When the Greeks came in contact with the empire of Assyria in the eighth century, e. g. from Sinope, they began to use the term of all its subjects; the name first occurs in Pindar, fr. which settlement at Themiscyra near Amisus. prw=tos. H. shows real insight in seeing that, though the complete conquest of the Asiatic Greeks by Lydia was brief, it was an event of first-rate importance, as the 'beginning' of the subjection of Greeks to barbarians. For the Cimmerians cf. 15 nn. Nicolaus Damascenus (F. H. G. iii. 383) calls Candaules 'Sadyattes'. Hesychius (s. v.*kuna/gxh) says that case 'C.' may be a cult-name, assumed by the king in addition to his own (cf. the new names taken by Popes). Hall (J. H. S. xxix. 19) points out that the name *mursi/los ('Mursil') has been found by Winckler at Boghaz Keui as that of a Hittite king. He suggests that the name, which is that of Pelops' charioteer, tends to confirm the old tradition that Pelops was an immigrant into Greece, and to show that perhaps in the fourteenth century B. C., Greece was subject to a Hittite dynasty. *sardi/wn. H. almost always follows (cf. iii. 120. 1 n.) the Persian usage in calling the Lydian satrapy by the name of its capital. *)alkai/ou. H. is the only writer who mentions Alcaeus as the son of Heracles, though both the grandfather of Heracles and Heracles himself (Diod. i. 24) are sometimes called Alcaeus. The Greeks identified the Asiatic Bel, in Cilicia (Meyer, i. 484) and perhaps in Lydia called 'Sandon' (cf. i. 71. 2), with Heracles, because he was a lion-tamer and a bow-bearer; he was probably a sun-god, though Meyer (v. s.) makes him a vegetation-god. H.'s list, then, may be a piece of genuine native tradition with Graecized names; at the head of it appear two great deities, Heracles and Omphale, representing the sun-god and Ashtoreth. But H. is inconsistent in vii. 61, where he makes Perseus, an ancestor of Heracles, rescue Andromeda, the granddaughter of Belus. It is more probable, however, that Heracles has no proper place in the genealogy, and is brought in by a piece of Greek syncretism, because the dou/lh (\u00a7 4) was supposed to be Omphale. The genealogy itself seems hopelessly confused; the (otherwise unknown, v. s.) son of a Greek hero is father of a Babylonian god and grandfather of the eponymous hero of Nineveh. While, however, the form in which the genealogy is presented is Greek, it may represent a real tradition of early connexion with the East. This can hardly have been with the great kingdoms of the Euphrates valley, for Assurbanipal states that when the ambassadors of 'Gugu of Luddi' arrived at Nineveh (R. P. i.1 68), 'the king's very fathers had not heard speak of its name'; but it may have been with the Hittite empire in Asia Minor, as was suggested by Sayce (ad loc.) as long ago as 1883. Hogarth says (I. and E., p. 75): 'it may well be that the rock monuments near Smyrna are memorials of a definite political occupation by the power of the Hatti.' Garstang too (p. 63) is disposed to accept H.'s traditions as having elements of truth in them. Ninus was, according to the Greeks (Ctes. Ass. ii, p. 390), the founder of Nineveh; but his name does not appear on the monuments. Belus is properly a common name, 'lord,' but became identified with the chief god of Babylonia (cf. Hastings' D. of B., s. v. Baal). This dynasty traced back its descent to the god *mh/n (J. H. S. xix. 80); it has a more genuine sound than that of the Heracleids above. The dynasty was If Cotys be rightly connected with the Thracian goddess Cotytto, whose rites (Strabo, 470) were like those of the Phrygian Cybele, then the genealogy may represent the combination of the European (Cotys) and the Asiatic (Atys) elements (App. I. 4); but all this is most uncertain. *mhi/wn. For 'Maeonians' cf. App. I. 8. Homer only knows this name (Il. ii. 864; x. 431, &c.); the earliest occurrence of 'Lydian' in a Greek author is in Xanthus, fr. 1. The identification of Maeonians with Lydians was not always accepted (Strabo, 572). Assuming its truth, however, it may be conjectured that the Lydians represent rather the European element in the people, the Maeonian the Asiatic. Radet (p. 59) thinks that the statement on the monuments of Assurbanipal (u. s.) means only that the Luddi were unknown by that name; he therefore connects 'Lydian' with the rise of Gyges; but this is very doubtful. 'Maeonian' survived as a tribal name (vii. 77), and as the name of a city (Plin. N. H. v. 111) and a district on the upper Hermus (Strabo, 576, 628), including the *katakekaume/nh. dou/lhs. The usual story (Apollod. ii. 6. 3) is unknown to H.; it called Omphale a daughter of Iardanus (whose name may be Semitic, cf. 'Jordan'), and made Hercules her bought slave. Later writers, especially the Roman poets, make him assume women's dress and do women's work. Meyer (i. 487) considers that this story is based upon the special Anatolian rites of the great nature-goddess, in which her worshippers cut themselves in sympathy with her sorrows, and even unsexed themselves (cf. story of Attis); so, too, maidens sacrificed their chastity to her (cf. 93. 4; 199 nn.). But if this is the origin of the myth, it is curious that its special feature, the woman's dress, &c., appears only in late versions. It seems better, therefore, to compare the story of Hercules serving Omphale with that of Apollo serving Admetus, and to explain both as a sort of atonement by service; the price of blood shed is worked off in this way. Whence H. derived the figure 505 is a puzzle. According to some it is a calculation based on the average length of a reign; if a generation was taken at 33 1/3 years (ii. 142. 2), a reign might average 22 1/2. R. Schubert (K\u00f6n. von Lyd., p. 8) adds the five generations of the Mermnadae (c. 13) to the 22 here, and allows an average of 25 years per generation, thus getting (27 x 25 =) 675 for the total. Deductig the 170 years of the Mermnadae, he gets the 505 given to the Heraclidae (cf. App. XIV. 5). This is plausible, but only one thing is certain, that the figures have no historic value. Gyges is called son of 'Dascylus' (Nic. Dam., fr. 49; F. H. G. iii. 383), a name which suggests 'Dascyleum', a town on the southeast of the Propontis, which gave its name to a Persian satrapy. This connexion agrees with the Northern origin suggested for the Mermnadae (App. I. 8), and would explain why a town, otherwise unimportant, was made a centre of Persian government, as being the origin of an earlier royal house. u(pereti/qeto, 'communicated' (cf. 107. 1); it governs also to\\ ei)=dos, u(perepaine/wn being added epexegetically. It is curious that the only other story of Candaules also implies aesthetic enthusiasm; he bought a picture by Bularchus of the 'proelium Magnetum' for its weight in gold (Plin. N. H. xxxv. 55). Radet (p. 131) accepts both stories. It is safer to reject both; but if the 'battle of the Magnesia' be a reality and be that against the Cimmerians, their raids must be antedated. Some suppose H. to imitating Heraclitus (fr. 15) o)fqalmoi\\ tw=n w)/twn a)kribe/steroi ma/rtures; but is a common one (cf. 'seeing is believing') and the verbal resemblance nil. The gnomic character of the story e(autou=. a)rxh/n, 'at all,' put for the sake of emphasis (cf. iii. 39. 4); but in ix. 60. 2 a)rxh/n = 'to begin with', and this may be the sense everywhere in H. The door 'stood open' for light and air; the present participle (for the past) is common in H. 'Even for a man', much more for a woman. For the contrast of barbarian and Greek feeling cf. Thuc. i. 6. 5 and Pl. Rep. v. 452 C, who points out that it was only recently the Greek ideas of propriety had changed. foita=n. These visits to the queen are purely Greek; a Lydian queen would be secluded in the in what way,' for another vivid colloquialism. It is quite in accordance with Eastern usage that the usurper should take the wife of his predecessor. Cf. 2 Sam. xvi. 21-2 (Absalom and David), and iii. 68. 3. tou= kai\\. The editors bracket these lines, which disturb the connexion, and the technical i)a/mbw| trime/trw| is suspicious; H. (47. 2 et al.) uses to/nw|. But Crusius, P. W. (s. v. Archilochus), accepts them as genuine. The line of Archil. decision of the Pythia may perhaps be historic; Gyges' gifts were probably given for a good reason (cf. a)pe/pemye, 'he duly sent,' 14. 1); but the prophecy of future vengeance is clearly post eventum. H.'s simple faith (lo/gon ou)de/na ktl.) might almost be irony. Cf. viii. 96. 2 for a similar instance of an oracle, if not conveniently remembered, at least only understood, after fulfilment. This chapter, and still more cc. 50-1, are important as illustrating the sources of H. (cf. Intr. \u00a7 24). It may be noted, however, that, while he repeats the stories of the Delphic sacristans, he tries, here as elsewhere, to exercise his critical faculty (14. 2; 51. 3, 4); he did not reproduce his information mechanically (as Nitzsch maintains, R. M. 1872, Intr. \u00a7 28), but blended one story with another. Important states had their own treasuries, where the dedicated objects were under the national charge. The importance of Corinth is seen in the fact that foreign kings put their offerings under its care (so Midas inf.; Croesus, 50. 3; Euelthon of (Cypriot) Salamis, iv. 162. 3). For this treasury cf. Frazer, P. v. 295; its remains were discovered by the French in 1893. For the treasuries at Olympia and elsewhere cf. Dyer, J. H. S. xxv. 294 seq.; no foreign treasury is known but the oi)=kos *ludw=n at Delos (ib. 309). For Cypselus cf. v. 92 n. This passage illustrates the constant endeavour of tyrants to conciliate important shrines; so the mediaeval tyrants in Italy sought confirmation of their usurpations from the Holy See or the Holy Roman Empire. After the overthrow of the Cypselids Delphi permitted this change in the dedications, but the Eleans refused to allow it at Olympia (Plut. De Pyth. Orac. 13). The kings were alternately 'Midas' and 'Gordias' (cf. the placenames Mideum and Gordium. For Phrygia and Midas cf. App. I. 7). prokati/zwn. pro is emphatic, 'sat for judgement and gave justice.'

The attack on Miletus was unsuccessful, and Gyges seems to have entered into friendly relations with the city; he 'allowed' it to plant Abydos on the Hellespont (Strabo, 590). No doubt the common danger from the Cimmerians led to this attempt to guard the north-west entrance into Asia. Gyges was also repulsed at Smyrna (Paus. iv. 21. 5, and Mimnermus, frs. 13, 14). Stein takes to\\ a)/stu as emphatic, the 'lower town' as opposed to the citadel. For the mouths of the great rivervalleys, i. e. Maeander (Miletus), Cayster (Colophon), Hermus (Smyrna); the Lydian kings to the tradeoutlets to the Aegean. H.'s account of Gyges' campaigns is very insufficient; he also conquered the Troad (Strabo, 590), and Caria seems to have been subject to him; perhaps also he took Magnesia (on the Hermus: Nic. Dam. fr. 62). (See Note C, p. 448.) The Cimmerians of (cf. our 'Cimmerian', a use as old as Milton's L'Allegro, 'In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell.' For the Cimmerian invasion in H. cf. also cc. 103, 105-6, and (especially) iv. 11-12. It is an event of the greatest importance; the main points as to it may be summarized under four heads. 1. Its course. The Cimmerians seem to have lived originally in South Russia (cf. iv. 12. 1 and 'Crimea'): they were expelled thence by the Scythians, who were fleeing 'across the Araxes' (probably the Volga) from the Massagetae (iv. 11. 1). This 'common tradition of Greeks and barbarians' (iv. 12. 3) may well be true; it is in accordance with all analogy. As to the route, however, which the Cimmerians took, opinion is much divided. H. is clearly wrong in his details: (1) he brings the horde along the east coast of the Black Sea, which is impossible, owing to its precipitous nature; (2) he combines the original expulsion of the Cimmerians from Europe (end of eighth century) with the Scythian raids of the last quarter of the seventh century (c. 103 nn.). As to the accuracy of his general view, there is much uncertainty. It used to be maintained (e. g. Meyer, i1. 452, 463; but he has now altered his opinion so far as to bring the Cimmerians from the East, i. 473) that the Cimmerian and the Scythian raids were quite independent movements, different in direction and different in date, which H. or his informants wrongly combined. Some of the most modern orientalists, however (Maspero, iii. 342 n.; Pr\u00e1[sbreve]ek, Pers., pp. H.'s chief point, that both Cimmerians and Scythians entered Asia Minor from the northeast. The Cimmerians settle round L. Van, the Scyths round L. Urumiah; then, under Esarhaddon, the Scyths drive the Cimmerians west into Asia Minor (Pr\u00e1ek, p. 120). This view may well be right in the main; it explains the importance of Sinope as a seat of the Cimmerians (cf. iv. 12. 2). But it is extremely probable that another body of Cimmerians was at the same time entering Asia Minor from the north-west (cf. iv. 11. 4 n.); they held Antandrus for a century (Arist. in Steph. Byz. s. v.), and they were accompanied (Strabo, 61, 647) by the Treres, a Thracian tribe (Thuc. ii. 96. 4). This invasion from the north-west may be compared to that of the Gauls in 278 B. C. (See Note I, p. 454.) 2. Its date. In the time of Sargon (722-705) we hear of the Gimirrai and I[sbreve]kuza ('Cimmerians and Scyths', Pr\u00e1ek, p. 115) north of Ararat; both Esarhaddon (681-668) and Assurbanipal (668-626) speak of victories over the Cimmerians. It is in connexion with them that the Assyrian monuments mention Gyges, who was on the throne of Lydia when they appeared, and who, warned by the god Assur in a dream, sought Assyrian aid against them (R. P. i1, p. 68). Revolting from Assyria later (cf. ii. 152. 3 n.), he was killed by them. Sardis was taken about 657; Strabo (627), quoting Callisthenes, makes it taken twice, which is doubtful. H. wrongly makes the Cimmerian invasions begin under Ardys; the reason is that his earlier Lydian kings are antedated. The date for the Cimmerians in Eusebius\u20141078 B. C.\u2014is explained by the confusion of them with the Amazons (cf. Diod. ii. 44; perhaps we have a trace of this confusion in H. iv. 110). 3. Its relation to the Greeks. Magnesia was captured (Archil, fr. 20), but Ephesus, encouraged by Callinus (fr. 3), it was 'a plundering raid', not a conquest (i. 6. 3). In fact, it may be said to have benefited the Greeks by breaking for a time the Lydian power; so the Mongols of Timour, by their victory over the Turks at Angora (A. D. 1402), postponed for half a century the fall of Constantinople. 4. General effects. Asia as a whole suffered more than the Greeks. The Bithynians, formerly a European tribe (vii. 75. 2), now settled in Bithynia; the Phrygian kingdom received a blow from which it never recovered; the old kingdom of Urartu disappears, and the Armenians (and perhaps also the Cappadocians, Pr\u00e1[sbreve]ek) come on the stage of history. It was an early 'wandering of the nations'. Perhaps even more important was the blow to the great Assyrian Empire. Although its diplomacy made use of the Scyths (c. 103 n.), yet the raids of these northern barbarians in the seventh century were one of the causes of its overthrow. Of the effect produced by these early 'Vandals and Huns' we have a clear trace in the contemporary Isaiah (v. 26 seq.) and in Ezekiel's picture (c. 39), drawn early in the sixth century, of the army of destruction from the north; by a curious confusion, Gyges, the victim of the Cimmerians, has become 'Gog', the 'prince of Meshech and Tubal', i. e. of the Moschi and Tibareni, part of the invading hordes. The best short account of the Cimmerian invasion is Busolt, ii. 461-4, who does not accept H.'s combination. For the Median war and the general policy of Alyattes cf. cc. 73-4 nn. He was the founder of Lydian greatness, extending his power to the Halys. ktisqei=san, 'colonized from'; it was previously an Aeolian city. Smyrna was destroyed as a city, and only inhabited kwmhdo/n (Strabo, 646); it does not occur in the Athenian tribute-lists, but its coins begin again in the fourth century, at least fifty years before its refounding by Antigonus and Lysimachus, circ. 300 B. C. (Head, H. N. 591). The Lydian conquest was generally merciful; but Smyrna, commanding as it did the outlet of the Hermus valley, was too formidable to be spared. Clazomenae also was attacked in order to secure this valley. The defeat of Alyattes at Clazomenae must have been after his capture of Smyrna; it lay further west on the gulf of Smyrna. All these later campaigns are after the Median war (cf. c. 73 and Busolt, ii. 469). For the 'flutes, lyres, and oboe of high and of deep note' see D. of A., s. v. tibia and lyra (for phkti/s). The au)lo/s differed from the flute (su=rigc), in having 'a mouthpiece in which a vibrating reed was fitted'; it seems always to have been played in pairs. Varro (in Serv. ad Aen. ix. 618) says i. e. it had the two octaves in the same instrument. The phkti/s is condemned by Plato (Rep. 399) as being polu/xordos; it was akin to the Lydian ma/gadis, which had twenty strings. Aul. Gellius (i. 11), mistranslating H., speaks of the musicians, male and female, as 'lascivientium delicias conviviorum'; Meyer (ii. 390) thinks the reference is to organized movements of cavalry, controlled by music (cf. Thuc. v. 70 for military music). But the point is simply that the Lydian raids were easy and unresisted. o( de\\ ta/ t<*> In antithetical sentences, especially when the first is negative, H. often puts the subject in the second before the de/, even though (as here) both sentences have the same subject (cf. 66. 3). The Limeneion seems to be the coast district in which lay the four (Strabo, 635) 'harbours' of Miletus. The words ta\\ me/n nun ... e)ntetame/nws interrupt the narrative, and Stein sees in them one of the later additions of H. to his work; but the passage reads more like a first draft than an afterthought. Chios, commanding the sea approach to Erythrae, was its natural enemy; it was also a rival to Samos, which was the perpetual trade competitor of Miletus. Hence the alliance of Miletus and Chios is natural; cf. Thuc. viii. 17. *)asshsi/hs. Athena Assesia is probably a local deity adopted by the Greek settlers; this seems indicated by her cult epithet, for which cf. the place-ending '-assus' (App. I. 4). It would be usual in prose to have pri\\n a)/n after the negative, but H. usually, like Homer, writes h)/. Cf. L. and S. s. v. B. II. 2 a. The mention of Delphi confirms the inference, probable on other grounds, that H. is writing from Delphian sources. As usual, at any rate in his early history, H. prefers a religious motive; probably it was the pressure of Median aggression on the east (cf. 16 n.) which compelled Alyattes to leave the Milesians alone. The asyndeton emphasizes the confident reliance (oi)=da) of the historian on his oracular source; to the 'further' statement of the Milesians he does not commit himself, though they might be supposed to be well-informed about their own country. Cf. Macan (1895) civ. for the use of oi)=da in H., which is used alike for what he has seen himself, for what he has been told, and for mere inferences. *peri/andron. For P. and Thrasybulus cf. v. 92; the mediation of P. is probable, for he had friendly relations with both parties (cf. the scandalous story of iii. 48, and the Lydian offerings in the Corinthian treasury at Delphi, cc. 14, 50), and Corinthian trade suffered from the war. The ostentation of plenty in a besieged city is common in picturesque history (cf. a similar story of Bias at Priene, Diog. Laert. i. 5. 83, and the deliverance of Perugia from Totila the Goth by this means, at the suggestion of St. Herculanus); but Miletus, having command of the sea (17.3), probably had really suffered little. cei/nous implies only friendly relations; summa/xous is stronger, an offensive and defensive alliance (cf. 69. 3). The Lesbians are quoted as the countrymen of Arion (of Methymna); there was a variant of the story (Lucian, Dial. Mar. 8) placing it in the Aegean, when Arion was returning to Methymna. For tyrants as patrons of art cf. App. XVI, \u00a7 3. Arion's date is the end of the seventh century. Meyer (ii. 373) makes him as mythical as Orpheus or Marsyas, and Crusius (in P. W. s. v. 840) suggests that his name simply = 'prizewinner,' but his reality may be admitted, although the only poem attributed to him (Ael. H. A. xii. 45; Bergk, P. L. iii. 80, describing the miracle) is a forgery. H. is wrong in attributing the diqu/rambos to him; the word occurs in Archilochus (circ. 680-640, Crusius in P. W. arranged it antistrophically for a chorus (cf. dida/canta); the invention of ku/klioi xoroi/ is ascribed to him by the older authorities, e. g. Hellanicus (fr. 85; F. H. G. i. 57; but others assigned them to Lasus (ib.)). If this be so, the fact underlying H.'s view as to the origin of the dithyramb at Corinth would be that the choric Dionysus song developed in north Peloponnese (Crusius in P. W. ii. 841; cf. v. 67 n. for such choruses at Sicyon). So Pindar (Olym. xiii. 19) attributes the dithyramb to Corinth, although the scholiast to this passage says he attributed it elsewhere to Naxos and to Thebes; all these places were connected with Dionysus. Its proper subject was *dionu/sou ge/nesis (Pl. Leg. 700 B), but it was extended. Arist. (Poet. 4, 1449 a) says tragedy begins a)po\\ ei)sh/gagen (R. M. 1908, p. 150). The e)dw/lia were seats in the vessel's stern, for the steerer and others in command, on a raised deck, though Torr (Anc. Ships, p. 57 and n.) says this was not always the case. toi=si is subject of a)naxwrh=sai, attracted into the dependent clause. For o)/rqios no/mos cf. Bergk, P. L. G. iii. 7, and for its familiarity Aristoph. Eq. 1279. It was attributed to Terpander and especially used in the worship of Apollo. Arion's song was an act of worship; it is this religious element in the story that commends it to H. The o)/rqios no/mos was in solemn and measured rhythm; cf. the fragments of Terpander (u. s.) for its spondaic character. The story of the dolphin is probably connected with a familiar coin type\u2014a hero riding on a dolphin\u2014e. g. Taras at Tarentum (Hill, G. & R. C. 175, Pl. 11); so too Arion on the later coins of Methymna (Head, H. N. 561). At Corinth also Melicertes was represented on a dolphin. It cannot be accidental that all these places, Tarentum, Lesbos, and Corinth, come in H.'s tale. The story is told at length in Plut. Sept. Sap. Con. 18 seq., where other dolphin stories are told, of Hesiod's murdered body, and of Enalus of Lesbos (cf. Frazer, P. iii. 398, for these stories). H. no doubt heard it at Taenarum, in connexion with the Arion monument (\u00a7 8), which may have been dedicated by the poet; Pausanias (iii. 25. 5) saw it, and supports H.'s account by the story of the dolphin of Poroselene. The Taenarum monument xii. 45. A small figure of this kind was actually found at Taenarum (Frazer, u. s.). An early inscription found at Thera was restored I. G. A. 453, for a different restoration. Even were B.'s restoration accepted, the inscription would only be parallel to H.'s *kadmh/ia gra/mmata (v. 59). It will be noticed that H. does not commit himself (\u00a7\u00a7 1, 8) to the story. The bowl-stand was the only Lydian dedication remaining at Delphi when Pausanias (x. 16. 1-2) visited the shrine; he describes it as 'in shape like a tower, broader at the base ... the sides are not each in a single piece, but the iron crossbands are arranged like the rungs in a ladder'. Athenaeus (210c) quotes Hegesander, a Delphian, as saying that on it were figures of animals in relief. Glaucus was a contemporary of Gyges (Eusebius); this work therefore was made some time before its presentation (cf. vii. 27 n., the golden plane-tree). For Glaucus cf. Overbeck, Schriftquellen, 263-72. Frazer (P. v. 313-14), who has a good note on 'welding' and 'soldering', explains ko/llhsis as 'welding', i. e. the beating of two pieces of white-hot iron into one, without any uniting substance. Murray (Gk. Sculpt. i. 81-2) translates 'soldering', i. e. uniting two pieces of metal by interposition of a third of different metal; but no method of soldering iron was known till quite recently. The art of welding was known in Egypt very early. Alyattes had tried to gain Ephesus by marrying his daughter to its tyrant Melas; there was always a strong Asiatic element there (cf. the character of its temple worship, 92 n., and the exclusion of its citizens from the Apaturia, 147. 2). Pindarus, however, the next tyrant, though nephew of Croesus, was head of the patriotic party; his exile was made a condition of the terms granted to Ephesus on its submission (Ael. V. H. iii. 26). For symbolic dedication cf. Thuc. iii. 104 (Polycrates and the island of Rheneia) and Plut. Sol. 12 (the supporters of Cylon). e)/sti: in singular, though the subject is plural, a sxh=ma *pindariko/n. For the site of Ephesus cf. v. 100 n. Grote points out (iii. 260 n.) that the 'two generations' of sta/sis (v. 28 n.) before the Ionic Revolt explain the failure of Miletus to resist further. For Pittacus, the ai)sumnh/ths of Mitylene, cf. Arist. Pol. iii. 14. 9, 1285 A (with Newman's notes, iii. 267 seq.), and his life in Diog. Laert. i. c. 4. He really belonged to the generation before Croesus, i. e. 600-570 B. C., as he was a contemporary of Alcaeus; Diog. Laert. i. 4. 79 says that he died in 570, having been tyrant ten years and having survived his tyranny ten years more. For the chronological weakness of H. on the sixth century cf. App. XIV. 6. Winckler (A. F. i. 511 f.) finds the name of Pittacus on an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, as an ally of Amasis, and thinks that P. anticipated the Eastern policy of Polycrates (cf. iii. 39 nn.). This would agree with the fact that one of the Lesbian exiles, brother of Alcaeus, Antimenides, an enemy of Pittacus, is found serving as a mercenary at Babylon (Strabo, 617). Pittacus and Bias were both reckoned among 'the Seven Sages' whose sayings form one of the 'sources' of H. Cf. cc. 29, 74 nn.; for them cf. Holm, i. 344-6, and Meyer, ii. 441. For Bias cf. Diog. Laert. i. 5. 82-8; his wisdom was proverbial, Hipponax, fr. 79. He is said to have composed a poem of 2,000 verses, showing how Ionia 'could prosper' (cf. 170. 2 n., where H. tells us he advised the Ionians to emigrate in a body to Sardinia). He was of Priene, and arbitrated between his city and Samos in the quarrel which was constantly renewed from the sixth to the second century (cf. Hicks1, 152, l. 22 for his name in the famous inscription as to this quarrel, now in the Ashmolean). H.'s story here is unhistorical; it is a piece of Gk. proverbial philosophy, which was fathered on any sage, just as Oxford stories are attributed to successive holders of an office. Croesus had good reason for inaction in the west, when affairs on his east frontier were so threatening (cf. i. 75. 1). ai)\\ ga/r (only here in H.) is Homeric. 'Sons of the Lydians' is also poetic (cf. iii. 21. 3). a)rw/menoi is unnecessary, but added epexegetically after the parenthesis e)pei/te ... ne/as: it is made (by an anacoluthon) to agree with the subject of this parenthesis. The Cilicians are not 'within the Halys' at all. The larger part of these conquests were the work of Alyattes; but H. uses the aorist participle with e)/xw, a construction which implies not only the act, but also the state resulting from the act. The last four lines are probably a gloss that has crept into the text (Stein), for (1) The mention of the Lydians as 'subdued' is absurd. (2) H. omits here tribes he knows elsewhere, e. g. the Caunii (c. 171), and inserts the *qunoi/, whom he knows nothing of in vii. 75. (3) The list includes the *xa/lubes, who were always placed east of the Halys till Ephorus, probably identifying them with the *(ali/zwnoi of the Catalogue (Il. ii. 856-7), brought them to the west of it. Strabo 678 (cf. also 552) refutes this error, but makes no mention of a similar mistake in H. The order of the words a)/lloi te oi( (not oi(/ te a)/lloi) shows H. did not consider Solon a sofisth/s; he uses the word (ii. 49. 1) of the followers of Melampus and (iv. 95. 2) of Pythagoras. The word here has, of course, no bad sense, though the causal participle (a)kmazou/sas plou/tw|) reminds us of the against the sophists. w(s e(/kastos, optative is distributive. Ephorus (Diog. Laert. i. 1. 40) said that all the Seven Sages except Thales met at the court of Croesus. H. knows nothing of this fiction. The truth of his story as to Solon and Croesus was early doubted, and it is now universally given up, on chronological grounds, though Plutarch (Sol. 27) declined to surrender a story 'so famous and so becoming to the character of Solon', because of xronikoi/tines lego/menoi kano/nes. Solon's legislation is put 594 B. C. (or perhaps in 591, *)aq. *pol. 14. 1), while Croesus came to the throne in 560 (or later); hence the Athenian's travels belong to the generation before Croesus. Of the travels there is no reason to doubt; they probably were mentioned in Solon's poems (cf. v. 113. 2, the praise of Philocyprus at Soli). A similar chronological mistake occurs when H. makes Solon borrow a law from Amasis of Egypt (cf. 30. 1; ii. 177. 2 n.). Early attempts (e. g. by Clinton) to save the credit of H. are refuted by Grote (iii. 150-1). Were the general chronology of H. for the sixth century less weak (cf. App. XIV. 6), the story of this meeting might be defended by adopting the later form of the tradition (Diog. Laert. i. 2. 50-1), that Solon's travels were after the usurpation of Pisistratus, i. e. after 560; D. L. improves on H. by making Solon say that Croesus in all his glory was not arrayed like a pheasant and a peacock. This date is given in a fourth century (?) philosophical dialogue (Oxyrhynchus Papyri, iv. 72 seq.), which also synchronizes the tyrannies of Pisistratus and Periander (cf. v. 95 nn.); but this only proves that H.'s mistakes had gained wide acceptance. It is best to look upon the tale as a piece of popular philosophy, in which Croesus and Solon are introduced as illustrations, on ethical and not on historical grounds. The fact that H. tells us nothing of the laws of Solon is a good instance of the danger of the 'argumentum ex silentio'; it is oversubtle to suppose, as some have done, that H.'s informants suppressed the constitutional work of Solon, in order to exalt the credit of the Alcmaeonid Cleisthenes as the founder of Athenian democracy. The explanation of the omission is probably that H. has no interest in constitutional history. pro/fasis includes the real as well as the ostensible cause. Translate 'having set forth, as he said, to see the world'. Plutarch (Sol. 25) says the laws were to be valid one hundred years; the exaggeration is characteristic of later Greek historians. *ai)/gupton. It is probably true that S. visited Egypt. The story is embellished by Plato (Tim. p. 24); he says that Solon learned from the Egyptians about the lost continent of Atlantis. Cf. 29 n. and ii. 177 n. for Solon and Amasis. eu)= h(kou/shs for the more usual eu)= e)/xw (cf. our 'farewell'). Elsewhere (as just below and 102. 2) it has a genitive with it. bi/ou = 'in substance', but the Gk. standard of wealth was not (w(s ta\\ par' h(mi=n). Cf. Ps. cxxviii. 5-6 for a similar idea of happiness. Grote (iii. 71) by a mistranslation assumes that the battle was against the men of Eleusis, and uses this passage to prove the lateness of the union of Attica. This latter fact is probable on other grounds (cf. Thuc. ii. 15. 1), but the battle here mentioned was almost certainly against the Megarians at the border-town of Eleusis (for this war cf. 59. 4 n.). e)/qayan, e)ti/mhsan. The two clauses go together; Tellus was honoured, as were the dead of Marathon, by burial on the spot (cf. Thuc. ii. 34. 1 for the usual custom of burial at Athens).

It is not necessary here to think that Tellus received a h(rw=|on (cf. i. 67 n.; v. 47); this would be inconsistent with the simplicity of the story, which lays stress on the happiness of an ordinary man who did his duty. proetre/yato, 'had moved' (to inquire further). the matter of Tellus,' is an ordinary accusative of respect. The element common to this story and that of Tellus is 'the glorious end', but there is a note of pessimism in this one; this may be characteristic, not of Solon, but of H. himself (cf. Intr. p. 49 and L. Campbell, Religion in Gk. Literature, p. 183). But cf. Solon, fr. 113, 115, 275-6. For Cleobis and Bito cf. Paus. ii. 20. 3, and Frazer iii. 193 for other references. For the Heraeum cf. Paus. ii. 17. The site has been explored by the American School since 1892 (cf. Waldstein's The Argive Heraeum, and a summary in Frazer, P. iii. 165 seq.). It stood on the road from Argos to Mycenae, about three miles south of the latter. The temple was burned in 423 (Thuc. iv. 133). As the site is a rocky terrace above the plain, the feat of strength was considerable; but H. avoids the absurdity of making Bito on another occasion carry a bull on his shoulders (Paus. ii. 19. 5). o( qeo/s here = 'Hera'. But it is often used in an abstract sense (cf. vii. 10 e). H., though a polytheist, is, like Sophocles, not uninfluenced by the philosophic tendencies which were affecting Greek religion in the sixth and fifth centuries; he is, perhaps, also influenced by Persian religion (c. 131 n.). For the monotheistic tendency of Pindar cf. Campbell, u. s. pp. 171, 183 f. For a good note on H.'s use of o( qeo/s ktl. cf. Macan (1895), cxi. n. 3. a)/meinon ... teqna/nai. The sentiment is common in Gk. literature (cf. Butcher, Some Aspects of Gk. Genius, p. 134); perhaps the bestknown example is Soph. O. C. 1225 seq., with its parallel in Theog. 425 seq.; cf. too Bacchyl. iii. 47 qanei=n is welcomed as an escape from troubles. This is different from the doctrine of the Pythagoreans, who taught that death was a good, as delivering the soul from the prison of the body. The Thracian Trausi (v. 4. 2 n.) are credited with the same idea as Solon. A similar story to that of Cleobis and Bito is told of Trophonius and Agamedes (who received death as a reward from Apollo for building his temple at Delphi) and of the poet Pindar (Plut. Consol. ad Apoll. c. 14, pp. 108-9). Homolle discovered these statues at Delphi (cf. Frazer, v. 563). The identification was disputed, but the actual inscription has now been found, and 'confirms most strikingly the accuracy of H.' (B. P. W. 1911, pp. 789-90); cf. also Philologus lxx, pp. 312-13, for the conjecture *(hrai=o/nde), and J. H. S. xxxi. 300 for a brief summary. fqonero/n. The thought is as old as 118sxe/tlioi/ e)ste, qeoi/, zhlh/mones e)/coxon instances in H. beside the story of Croesus are that of Polycrates and the whole account of Xerxes (iii. 39 seq.). It is one of the main motives of his history (cf. Intr. pp. 49-50), as being the cause of the changes of fortune (i. 207. 2) which he has to record. Since the Greeks conceived their gods in their own likeness, it was natural that they should make them tyrants; cf. file/ei o( qeo\\s ta\\ tw=n a)stw=n foneu/ein of the tyrant (v. 92 h). For other parallels cf. Hesiod, W. and D. 6 r(ei=a d' ta\\ de\\ 52, and Hor. Odes, i. 35. 2-4. The idea gradually became purified and moralized, so that it is no longer mere prosperity, but the pride bred of it, which the god hates. This form of the belief is found in H. (34. 1), but it occurs even earlier in the tragedians; cf. the magnificent form it may be compared to the teaching of the Hebrew prophets, e. g. Isa. x. 12 'I will punish the glory of his high looks'. Plato, Phaedr. 247 A excludes fqo/nos luphra/ excited by prosperity in others; Aristotle (Eth. ii. 7. 14) distinguished them into fqo/nos, ne/mesis, and e)pixairekaki/a, cf. Intr. p. 49 and Rhet. 10 (with Cope's notes). tw=| makrw=| xro/nw|, 'the whole duration of human life' (cf. v. 9. 3 for a different sense). The Greek 'limit', like that of Psalm xc. 10, varied from seventy to eighty years (cf. iii. 22 for the latter, and Solon frag. 27 (l. 17) and 20 o)gdwkontae/th moi=ra ki/xoi qana/tou for the two limits respectively). e)niauto/s (v. L. & S. s. v.) is any season of time (cf. Od. i. 16e)/tos h)=lqe periplome/nwn e)niautw=n); here it is made 360 days, a rough average between the solar and the lunar year (for the length of these and for the Calendar generally cf. ii. 4 nn.). H. makes a mistake as to 'intercalary months'; if they were ever inserted every other year, then the ordinary months were strictly lunar (i. e. 29 1/2 days), and made up only 354 days (not 360, v. s.): it is more probable, however, that there were only three intercalary months in eight years. H.'s calculation would give an average of 375 days a year. sumforh/. Tr. 'man is altogether a thing of chance'; cf. vii. 49. 3 for the sentiment, and Heraclitus' famous pa/nta rei=, ou)de\\n me/nei. This Solonian paradox is discussed by Aristotle (Eth. i. 11). Cf. Soph. O. T. 1528 seq. for an almost verbal repetition and Intr. p. 7; but the idea is a commonplace of Greek thought. Join metri/ws e)/xontes bi/ou (partitive genitive): the contrast between the men' and 'the lucky men of moderate means' is forced and not consistent with the omnipotence of chance; if H. meant that wealth is not eu)daimoni/a (as Aristotle, in Eth. x. 8. 9-11, where he refers to this passage), he certainly fails to say so; if he means that a man may be unlucky (a)tuxh/s) though wealthy, he is elaborately stating the obvious. a)/phros ktl.: for some of these conditions (w(=n ou)k a)/neu) necessary to happiness cf. Arist. Eth. i. 8. 16; to\\ eu)= zh=n combined for a Greek the two ideas of 'good life' and 'good living' (i. e. prosperity). The insufficiency of man causes the formation of the po/lis (Plat.

Cf. vii. 46. 4 for the sentiment, and iii. 40. 3, where pro/rrizos is again used. The change of subject from Solon (e)xari/zeto) to Croesus (a)pope/mpetai) is harsh (though not without parallel; cf. 31. 1), and so is the non-correspondence of ou)/te, ou)/te. o)lbiw/taton. For the thought cf. 32. 1 n. e)pe/sth. For the phrase and idea cf. Il. ii. 20, the dream of Agamemnon. The name Atys is that of the Phrygio-Lydian deity, Attes or Attis, clearly connected with the Syrian Ate (whose female double is Atargatis; cf. Meyer, i. 487): the cult itself is probably of Hittite origin and is closely connected with that of Adonis (Thammuz; cf. ii. 79. 2 n.). Frazer (G. B.2 ii. 130-7) describes the cult, and says that Attis is 'a deity of vegetation whose divine life manifested itself in the pine tree and the spring violets' (used in his ritual). According to one form of the legend Attes was killed by a boar, according to the other form (current in Pessinus) by selfmutilation (Paus. vii. 17. 10-12); this latter story is immortalized in the Attis of Catullus. Attes is both son and lover of the great mother-goddess, Cybele. For the worship of the mother and the son in Asia Minor cf. Ramsay, C. and B. pp. 87, 264. The swine, originally 'the sacred victim', typical of the god himself, has become by false interpretation the enemy of the God (Farnell, G. C. ii, p. 646). The interest of the story, from the historical point of view, is that H. (or his informants) has introduced a cultmyth into history; it has received a Greek colouring, for the steps taken to avert calamity are the means of bringing it to pass. (Cf. the myth of Oedipus.) The fact underlying the story seems to be that Croesus had a son, Atys, who died young. For Atys' son, Pythius, cf. vii. 27. 1. oi(: an Ethic dative; but it is used by H. also as a sort of possessive pronoun, e. g. iii. 14. 7 tw=n sumpote/wn oi(. Phrygia had probably been conquered by Alyattes (cf. App. I. 7); but Winckler (A. F. ii. 141) thinks the story here implies that it was still independent: Aeschylus (Pers. 770) speaks of its conquest by Cyrus as distinct from that of Lydia. The rite of purification (as performed by Circe for Jason and Medea) is described in Apol. Rhod. iv. 693 seq.; among other ceremonies a sucking pig was slain, and the blood poured on the guilty hands. The rite never occurs in Homer; it first appears in Gk. literature in the fragment of the Aethiopis of Arctinus, where Achilles is purified for the murder of Thersites. The old view was (Grote, i. 25) that the idea of purification was not Greek and was introduced from abroad; the usual modern view (Harrison, Prol. to Study of Gk. Rel.) is that the chthonian worships, with which rites of purification were connected, were pre-Homeric, i. e. pre-Achaean, and deliberately ignored by Homer in the interests of the Olympian deities. Cf. Frazer, P. iii. 53 seq. for rites of purification generally. For the similarity between Greeks and Lydians cf. App. I. 5. The name Adrastus seems to refer to the goddess Adrasteia (= 'Necessity'; cf. Aesch. P. V. 936); for her connexion with Nemesis cf. Farnell, G. C. ii. 499-500; he shows that she was a form of Cybele, who, 'through a misunderstanding of the name', acquired the character, really foreign to her, of 'a stern goddess of justice'. The Phrygian and the Argive Adrastus (cf. v. 67 n.) are both the victims of 'inevitable fate'. xrh=ma with gen. is a colloquialism common in a true the Lydians an a)gora/ and calls them 'citizens'. to/ goes with le/lhqe, as well as with manqa/neis, an accus. of respect (tr.

Zeus is invoked in a triple character, as the god who enjoined purification from unintentional guilt, and as the protector both of the hearth and of the rights of friendship; this (i. e. three attributes of one god) is a sort of intermediate stage to the idea of three gods with different attributes. e)pi/stion. The suppliant actually took refuge in the hearth when appealing to Zeus e)pi/stios. For cuit titles cf. Farnell, G. C. i. 35. Croesus not only asks for vengeance, but himself has a grievance against heaven; this he gives up (45. 2), just as he accepts Apollo's explanation in c. 91. 'The ways of god to men' are 'justified' in the wisdom which Croesus learns by experience. foneu\\s me/n. The rhetorical turn is to be noted, and the contrast between Adrastus' royal birth and the disasters which had befallen him. foneu/s is of course not literally true, but the exaggeration is natural. So Euripides makes Hecuba (882) call the murderer of her Croesus was the brother-in-law of Astyages (74. 4); but he had other than personal motives. The power of Persia was a menace to all the secondary powers (cf. 77. 2 for their union), just as that of Media had been under Cyaxares (cf. 73. 3 n. for diplomatic interference with Media). Moreover, Lydian trade was in danger from the uncivilized Persians (cf. 71. 2). For wholesale consultation of oracles cf. viii. 133-4. For Greek oracles in general in Hellenica, and Boucher-Leclercq, Divination dans l'Antiquit\u00e9, vol. iii. For the locality and oracle of Dodona cf. Frazer, P. ii. 159-60, for Zeus of Ammon ii. 42 n. Abae in E. Phocis; for its oracle cf. viii. 27, 33 n., 134, and Paus. x. 35 (with Frazer, v. 436 seq., who describes the present state of the ruins). For Amphiaraus and Trophonius cf. viii. 134 nn. The temple of Apollo at Didyma (cf. 157. 3 for description of it, 158 for its Medism (?), and vi. 19. 3 for its destruction in 494 B. C.; also 92. 2 nn.) was 22 1/2 miles from Miletus; it was often called 'of Branchidae', from the priestly family (cf. tou\\s *bragxi/das 158. 1), in whose charge it was; the name of the mythical founder, Branchus, has been connected etymologically with the Sans. Brahman, Lat. flamen. Some see in Apollo of B. a pre-Greek god (Meyer, i. 483; Paus. vii. 2. 6). Its site was explored by Newton (Essays, 75 seq.), who brought (1858) from its Sacred Way to the B. M. ten great seated figures of priests, which are interesting as showing Egyptian influence on Greek art in the sixth century (cf. Frazer, P. iv. 126). One of them, that of Chares (No. 14), is probably the oldest extant Greek portrait. The explorations were resumed by the Germans in 1899. suggrayame/nous, 'causing them to be written down for them,' i. e. by the profh/ths, who put the answer of the pro/mantis (vii. 111. 2) into proper shape, usually into hexameters (cf. c. 174 for iambics); here, however, the Pythia or pro/mantis seems to have given her answer in verse directly, without intermediary. In later times, from third century onwards, prose was the usual medium. As the answers were given all together, once a year originally, and once a month later (Plut. Q. G. 9, Mor. 292), it is obvious that the profh/ths was allimportant. Cf. Frazer, P. v. 235 for the inspiration of the pro/mantis. me/garon is always used by H. in a religious sense, though in Homer it means simply 'chamber' or (mostly in plural) 'house' (cf. aedes). Perhaps the Herodotean sense is the original one; the word may be connected with Semitic maghar ('cave,' RobertsonSmith, Relig. of Sem. p. 200). This use survives in the me/gara or 'caves' into which pigs were thrown at the Thesmophoria (Paus. ix. 8. 1 and Frazer, v. 29). For an underground shrine (of Palaemon) cf. Paus. ii. 2. 1. me/garon is the temple itself as opposed to the te/menos (cf. vi. 134. 2), and especially the shrine proper, where stood the image of the god (ii. 141. 3); it sometimes seems to be used interchangeably with a)/duton (cf. vii. 140. 1 and 3). It is, however, used for the whole building (not merely the shrine), ii. 143. 2. The 'shrine' at Delphi was at the west end of the cella, and beneath was the chasm into which it is said the priestess went down to divine (Frazer, v. 352-3; but cf. Opp\u00e9, J. H. S. xxiv, for good reasons against believing in 'the chasm'). The de/ is common in oracles (cf. 174. 5 et pass.); it marks off an answer from a preceding one given to other inquirers (u. s.). For a like claim to omniscience cf. Pind. Pyth. 9. 44 brass is it (the tortoise) clad above'; cf. 48. 2 for explanation. prosi/eto. This verb is more often used by H. with a personal subject, e. g. 135. 1 ceinika\\ no/maia *pe/rsai prosi/entai, but here of the thing, tr. 'none took him' (cf. our 'I take it' and 'it takes me'). This second use is found in Aristoph., e. g. Eq. 359, Vesp. 741. Some see in the remark as to Amphiaraus (c. 49) a tradition inconsistent with the statement here. But the story\u2014no doubt a Delphic one\u2014is consistent; Apollo alone gave a complete answer, but the neighbouring shrine of Amphiaraus did well enough to save its credit. proseu/xeto: he 'worshipped', recognizing in the oracle the power of the god. If the whole story is not simply a Delphic invention, we must suppose that Croesus was 'working the oracle' for the benefit of his Greek allies. au)to/s is emphatic; Croesus carried out his own plan, so as to keep his secret to the last. pa/nta: 3000 of every kind (cf. the idiomatic pa/nta de/ka, iv. 88. 1). The account of this holocaust is like that given by Lucian (de dea Syria 49, p. 485) of the spring sacrifice at Hierapolis; the offering of Croesus, however, is the provision of a feast for the god on a great scale, with all the furniture of the costliest, while that in Lucian leads up to self-mutilation in ecstatic frenzy. The pli/nqos or 'ingot' was square; they were 'beaten out' with the hammer (cf. 68. 1 for e)ch/laune); these h(mipli/nqia were about 18 by 9 by 3 inches. H. no doubt takes all these measurements from the inventory of Delphic treasures, and therefore is calculating by the Greek ph=xus, not the Persian (cf. 178. 3 n.). tri/ton h(., '2 1/2 talents'; for this drittehalb, &c. leukou= xrusou=: h)/lektron, a natural alloy of gold and silver, obtained from the washings of the Pactolus; it was also made artificially later. It consisted of at least 20 per cent. of silver to 80 of gold (cf. Plin. N. H. xxxiii. 80 'ubicumque quinta argenti portio est, electrum vocatur'); the usual proportion of silver was 27 per cent. Its value was to that of silver as 10 to 1 (that of gold to silver was reckoned at 13.3 to 1, cf. iii. 95. 1 n.), and so it was the first metal used in coins (cf. 94. 1 n.), for convenience of calculation as well as for its greater durability (Head, H. N.1 xxxiv). Stein thinks that, as electron ingots of this size, if solid, would weigh more than two talents, these were hollow. The number he explains by the arrangement of the pedestal; the lion stood on the 'four ingots of pure gold', under which were three stages of electrum ones, 15 (5 by 3), 35 (7 by 5), and 63 (9 by 7) respectively (i. e. 4 + 15 + 35 + 63 = 117). The 'ingots' were melted down by Phayllus in the Sacred War (Diod. 16. 56, who makes them 120, and mentions statues of a lion (cf. 50. 3) and of a woman (51. 5) as meeting the same fate). The lion was the beast of Cybele and Sandon, and appears as a type on early Lydian coins (cf. Hill, G. C. Pl. I. 7); nearly half the coins found at Ephesus (1904-5) show it (Hogarth, E. p. 90). For its place in Lydian mythology cf. 84. 3 (the story of Meles' lion cub), and in Anatolian art J. H. S. xix. 46-7 (with fig.); a stone lion from Branchidae of this date is in the B. M. (No. 17). The temple at Delphi was burned down in 548 B.C. [Paus. x. 5. 13; cf. ii. 180. 1 n.; for the restoration and the general history of the temple cf. v. 62 n., and Frazer, P. v. 328 seq.] This chapter is most interesting as showing the familiarity of H. with Delphi. For the Croesus bowl in its 'angle' cf. viii. 122. 1. Stein thinks the reference is to the projecting 'angle', formed by one of the two antae, with which the walls of the cella ended in front towards the pro/naos. ga/r. H. knows its size, because it was filled at the Theophania, a spring festival, which commemorated at Delphi the reappearance of the Sun-god. For Theodorus cf. Murray, G. S. i. 74 seq., where his works are enumerated and his originality discussed. He and Rhoecus N. H. xxxiv. 83. For an early instance of bronze casting at Samos cf. iv. 152. 4. Theodorus was the maker of Poly crates' ring (iii. 41. 1 n.), and also of the golden plane-tree (vii. 27. 2, though H. does not give his name in this case); he probably was a contemporary of Alyattes. Overbeck (Schriftq. 274-93) distinguishes an elder and a younger Theodorus. For ceremonial sprinklings cf. Tylor, P. C. ii. 434; the vessels stood, like modern holy-water stoups, by the entrance. fame/nwn ... le/gontes: the anacoluthon is very harsh. Kirchhoff argues (1) that the falsification was official, (2) that a motive for such complaisance towards Lacedaemonians is found in 448 B. C. (Thuc. i. 112. 5); therefore H.'s visit must have been about 447. The gaps in this argument are obvious. It is interesting to see H. exercising his critical faculty on the Temple records. ou)k e)pi/shma: L. & S. 'without an inscription' (as opposed to e)pige/graptai \u00a7 3), not, as Stein, 'indistinguishable'; this implies that most of the articles bore the name of Croesus as giver. a)rtoko/pou. The step-mother of Croesus attempted to poison him, and his life was saved by his 'baker' (cf. Plut. Mor. 401 E, de Pyth. Orac. c. 16, and c. 92 for the conspiracy of Croesus' step-brother, Pantaleon). to\\ custo/n should be a genitive absolute, but as it is a part of the ai)xmh/ it is attracted into the same case (cf. ii. 41. 4). For the temple of the Ismenian Apollo cf. 92. 1 n. The Parian marble (App. XIV. 6) dates this embassy 555 B.C., which Busolt (ii. 460 n.) makes the year of Croesus' accession. There seems to be no difference in sense between the subjunctive and the optative here; they are both deliberative; cf. i. 185. 6, where the optative precedes, for a similar change. We may suppose that the liberality of Croesus was intended to secure the Lacedaemonian alliance through Delphic (Arist. Rhet. iii. 5). The staters were rather more than 25 per cent. heavier than darics, and therefore worth about <02> 1 8s. each. Plutarch, however (de Sera Num. Vind. 12, p. 556), makes Croesus propose to give a larger sum\u2014'four minae' = about <02> 16. The promantei/a was the right of either consulting the oracle on behalf of others (Homolle) or of consulting the oracle before ordinary visitors, whose positions were determined by lot; the analogy of proedri/a makes the second explanation preferable. The whole question is discussed in R. E. G. xiii., p. 281 seq., which sums up on the whole against Homolle's view. a)te/leia was freedom from taxes for Lydians consulting the shrine; the proedri/a was the right to front places at the Pythian and other festivals (cf. ix. 73. 3 for such rights). These honours and similar ones (e. g. prodiki/a and e)/gkthsis kai\\ oi)ki/as, which corresponds to the gi/nesqai *delfo/n of this passage) are found in inscriptions at Delphi (e. g. Dittenberger, 484, 662; the former of these is in favour of Sardes\u2014'as an ancient friend'). Radet (p. 217) compares the decree in honour of Croesus with the rights given by the Amphictyons to Philip in 346 B. C.; it made him a member of the Hellenic world (cf. Jebb, Essays, p. 223, for similar grants at Delos). e)nefore/eto, 'filled himself full of,' i. he be thought to abuse his authority' (against the Catilinarians). For explanation of this oracle cf. c. 91. 5. podabre/. The effeminacy of the Lydians was later (cf. App. I. 4 and 79. 3; 155); but they had already developed a luxurious civilization (cf. 71. 2, the story of Sandanis). A digression on the races of Greece. With this generally cf. App. XV. A Dorian himself, H. identifies the Dorians with the Hellenes. Hellas was originally a district in Thessaly, closely connected with Phthia and ruled by Achilles (Il. ix. 395), whose followers are 'Myrmidons and Hellenes' (Il. ii. 684). But in the Catalogue (ii. 530) it is also used as a general name, *pane/llhnes Aristarchus as an interpolation). 'Hellas' was already used in a general sense by Archilochus and Hesiod (Strabo, 370), i. e. in the seventh century, and had become established in this sense before 580 B. C., when two 'Hellanodicae' (cf. I. G. A. 112) were appointed for the Olympic games; but the date depends on the reading in Paus. v. 9. 4, 5, which is a little uncertain (cf. Frazer, P. i. 584; iii. 489). Thucydides (i. 3) describes the transition from the special to the general sense; this was probably due to the influence of the myth of Achilles; as the Greeks, by contrast with the barbarians, became conscious of their own similarity, it was natural they should assume the name of the people whose chief was the hero of the national epic and the type of heroic manhood. The adoption of the name may be connected with the spread of Dorian influence (cf. *zeu\\s *(ella/nios and *)aqana\\ *(ellani/a in the 6). The origin of 'Hellenes' is uncertain; it may be connected with the *selloi/, the priests of Zeus at Dodona (Il. xvi. 234, where Achilles prays to this god). This is partially confirmed by Aristotle (Meteor. i. 14, 352 A), who says that 'ancient Hellas' was peri\\ *dwdw/nhn. For the whole subject cf. Busolt, i. 196 seq. Bury has an ingenious theory that the name received its first great extension in connexion with the Achaean colonies in Magna Graecia (J. H. S. xv. 236); but his proof is by no means complete. This chapter (with c. 145, and viii. 43 and 73) is interesting as showing that the story of the Dorian Invasion was fully developed in H.'s time: he assumes its main points and even refers to details, e. g. vi. 52, ix. 26. 3. The questions as to it may be summed up under two heads:\u2014 I. Evidence for reality of Dorian Invasion. The oldest evidence for it is Tyrtaeus, (R. M. xlv) argues that the story is an invention, based on mistaken etymologies (e.g. of 'Naupactus' and unhistorical combinations, to explain the difference between Homeric Greece and Historic Greece. His arguments are briefly these: (1) The evidence is late; there is nothing as to the migration in Homer (but Homer is equally silent as to Greek migrations to Asia Minor which are pretty generally accepted). (2) Race names are very late (Thuc. i. 3; but this argument confuses name and fact: races exist as distinct, though their general names may be late). (3) There was no real gap between 'Mycenaean' and historic times, e. g. a Dorian column is found in the Lion Gate at Mycenae. The transition was gradual, but the Greeks, not understanding such a process, invented a catastrophe. (This argument is not admitted by archaeologists generally; it makes the Mycenaean culture too late; cf. Busolt, i. 116 n.) Arguments for the historic reality of the invasion are (cf. generally Meyer, ii. 47): (1) Modern archaeological research tends to vindicate the accuracy of Greek myths in their general outlines. (2) If tradition is ever good evidence, it would be so for an event of such importance. (3) Tradition is confirmed by the existence of subject classes (probably subject races) in many parts of the Peloponnese. (4) The Dorians always looked on themselves as being new-comers in the Peloponnese. (5) The tradition explains such facts as resemblance of Dorian and Aeolian dialects (Busolt, i. 195) and the connexion of the Lacedaemonians with Doris, which is of great importance in historic times (Thuc. i. 107. 2). It must be frankly admitted, however, that we know nothing of the details of the Invasion. II. Main points as to Dorian Invasion. (1) As to its origin. It was part of a general movement from the North, connected with the Phrygian migration (vii. 73), and perhaps (but remotely) with the invasions of Egypt under the Nineteenth Dynasty (cf. App. X. 8). (2) As to its course. (a) The invaders were of mixed race; all probability (cf. the invasion of the Cimbri and Teutones) confirms tradition on this. b) Doris was a stage in the progress of part of the invaders. c) Some of the conquerors came by sea (cf. the local tradition as to Solygeius (Thuc. iv. 42. 2) and the Temeneion near Argos (Strabo, 368)). d) The conquest was gradual, and may have been assisted by the discontented elements in the population of the Peloponnese. (3) As to its ultimate results. It was part of a series of movements. Thucydides (i. 2. 3) connects it, though not causally, with the conquest of Boeotia; and it may have led to the migration to Asia Minor (c. 145). to\\ me/n: obviously the Pelasgic race, although this sense is inconsistent with what H. says of Pelasgians in Asia Minor (146. 1) or of those in Attica (vi. 137); he writes too absolutely, having in view only the contrast between the mass of the Athenians, who were ou) metana/stai (vii. 161. 3), and the much-wandering Dorians. These are placed first in Phthiotis, because this was the traditional home of Deucalion, the Greek Noah, the grandfather of Aeolus, Xuthus, and Dorus. H. may be following the post-Homeric epic, 'Aegimius.' Histiaeotis was in north-west Thessaly; H. transfers it to the north-east (the district really of Thessaliotis (57. 1)), probably in accordance with Cretan tradition (for Dorians in Crete cf. Od. xix. 177). The invaders of Crete must have originally lived on the sea coast. *kadmei/wn. For the Cadmeans cf. v. 61. 2 n.; as there it is said that the Cadmeans fled to the Illyrian Encheleis, their migration must have been to north-west; hence it is obvious that the legend placed the Dorians in north-west Thessaly (not north-east). *pi/ndw|. P. is one of the towns of the Dorian Tetrapolis, the others being Erineus (cf. viii. 43 and Tyrtaeus, u. s.), Boeum, and Cytinium (Strabo, 427); it lay on a river of the same name on the south-east of Mount Oeta; for it *pindo/qen o)rnu/menoi. Others (less probably) take Pindus to be the mountain chain, i. e. H. would bring his Dorians from north-east to north-west Thessaly and then later (e)nqeu=ten au)=qis) to their home in Doris. *makedno/n. Stein doubts whether H. means to connect the Dorians with the Macedonians (cf. viii. 43), arguing that H., if he had believed this, would have explained the unusual form (*makedno/n) by the common one (*makedw/n). It seems, however, as if H. must have been thinking of the claim of the Macedonian kings to be Argives (cf. v. 22. 2; viii. 137); but this would prove nothing as to connexion of the races. He may be referring to some unknown tradition, connecting the Dorians in north-west Thessaly with their Macedonian neighbours to the north; e. g. Myres (J. H. S. xxvii. 178) shows that in the Homeric Catalogue the strip of coast between Mount Olympus and the Axius is unaccounted for; he argues that the Dorians (unknown to Homer except in Od. xix. 177) had already reached this. *druopi/da. D. was the original name of the lower part of the Pindus valley, which in historic times was Doris (viii. 31; cf. Strabo, 434). The Dryopians originally dwelt on both sides of Mount Oeta, and south as far as Parnassus; they are said to have been expelled from the coast by the Malians, and by Heracles from the Pindus valley (Apollod. ii. 7. 7). Heracles was especially honoured by the Malians (vii. 176. 3), and in the east of Central Greece generally (Meyer, ii. 166). Here the Dorians learned his worship, and made his son Hyllus to be adopted by king Aegimius, and so to be the ancestor of the Spartan kings. The expelled Dryopes settled at Hermione and Asine in the Peloponnese (viii. 73. 2), (viii. 4), and Euboea (Thuc. vii. 57. 4); also in Cythnus (viii. 46. 4) and in Ionia (146. 1). For an account of the Dryopes, based in part on cult usage, cf. Paus. iv. 34. 6. ou(/tws: i. e. they get their Dorian name when they conquer the Peloponnese. This is probably wrong; 'it is native in the upper Cephissus valley' (Meyer, ii. 47). For H.'s Pelasgian theories and for the relation of Pelasgi to Hellenes cf. App. XV. He here tries to infer the original language of the whole people from survivals in his own day; his method is scientific, whatever may be thought of his results. *krhstw=na. If this is read, Creston is a town in Thrace, north of Chalcidice, on the high ground between the Axius and the Strymon; this district is called *krhstwnikh/ (vii. 124. 1; cf. Thuc. ii. 99. 6*grhstwni/a). This reading is open to objections: (1) Creston is not definitely mentioned as a town elsewhere except in St. Byz., who is quoting H. (2) H. calls the inhabitants of the district *krhstwnai=oi (v. 3. 2), not *krhstwnih=tai as here. (3) The only Pelasgians in this district are in the Athos peninsula (Thuc. iv. 109. 4), and these are definitely called 'the Tyrsenians who formerly settled in Lemnos and Athens'; but H. distinguishes the people here from the Tyrsenians and from the Pelasgians 'who lived with Niebuhr in e. Cortona in Etruria, originally an Umbrian town, which H. distinguishes from the famous Croton in South Italy by the words u(pe\\r T. This conjecture has been widely accepted (e. g. by Meyer, F. i. 234); the reasons are: (1) *turshnoi/ everywhere in H. means 'the Etruscans'. (2) Dion. Halic. dh\\ fulakh=| (3), reads *krotwnih=tai, seq.) describes the migration of the Pelasgians to Umbria, where they made Cortona their chief town (cf. Hell. Fr. 1 for the same tradition; but Hell. identifies the Pelasgians and the Etruscans). (3) The reading *krhstw=na, it is suggested, is a later correction, based on an inaccurate remembrance of Thuc. iv. 109. For the objections to this conjecture cf. Myres, J. H. S. xxvii. 195 seq.; he argues 1) H. is unfamiliar with Italy, and would not compare an Italian town with Aegean peoples; 2) he knows this part of the Aegean coast-line well; 3) the passage of Thucydides really confirms H. It may be added that the MSS. agree in giving *krhstw=na. For H.'s familiarity with North Italy cf. 196. 1. Thessaliotis lay west of Olympus and Ossa (cf. 56. 3 for Dorians there); it was more often called 'Pelasgiotis'. Placie and Scylace lay east of Cyzicus on the Propontis (here called 'Hellespont'; cf. iv. 38. 2 n.). For the expulsion of 'Pelasgians' from Attica cf. vi. 137 n., from Lemnos, vi. 140, and App. XV, \u00a7 5. xarakth=ra. H. uses this word of the four Ionian dialects (142. 4); from this parallel Thirlwall (i. 53) argued that H. meant here that 'the Pelasgian language ... sounded to him a strange jargon, as did the dialect of Ephesus to a Milesian, and as the Bolognese does to a Florentine'. This is ingenious, but the Pelasgian question cannot be settled so easily. a)posxisqe/n. The sense of this word is shown in iv. 56. 1, where H. uses it of a river separating from another; so in 143. 2, of the 'separation' of the Ionians of Asia Minor from the rest of the Ionians. Obviously, therefore, H. thought his 'barbarian' Pelasgi closely akin to the Hellenes. In says to\\ *(ellhniko\\n a)pekri/qh tou= barba/rou e)/qneos, i. e. marked itself off as somewhat superior. Thucydides (i. 3. 2) carries the process a stage further; the development is not 'spontaneous', but the result of 'contact with the fu/sis of the genuine Hellene'; T. s' 'explanation of the transmissibility of culture is to be sought not in physiology but in psychology' (Myres, A. and C. p. 152). Whether a)posxisqe/n here implies local or ethnical separation, it is impossible to decide, but probably the latter. me/ntoi: contrasted with me/n, growth as compared to language. proskexwrhko/twn. Thucydides (i. 3) also speaks of the 'Hellenes' absorbing Pelasgic and other peoples; among these 'others' are the Minyans of Orchomenus, the Abantes, the Dryopes (146. 1), &c. The account of the tyranny of Pisistratus, one of the most valuable of H.'s contributions to sixth century history; for it cf. App. XVI, \u00a7\u00a7 5-8. It should be read with Arist. *)aq. *pol. c. xiii. 3-17, an account based in part on H., but with many additions (cf. Busolt, ii. 302 n. 2). For H.'s general judgement of the Pisistratidae cf. v. 78 n. katexo/menon kai\\ d. These words have been attacked as unfair; but it must be remembered that they are a description of Athens, as Croesus would hear of it circ. 550 B.C.; as such they are too compressed, but in the main accurate; Athens was 'held down' by P., and the fact that it was 'torn asunder' gave him his opportunity. Chilon was ephor at taken by some (e. g. Niese in P. W. s. v. Chilon) to mean that he established the ephorate; but more probably it only implies that he greatly increased its power. A fragment of a second century author (Rylands Papyri, No. 18) says of him with King Anaxandridas that turanni/das kate/lusan; it goes on to mention Hippias of Athens and Aeschines of Sicyon, apparently as put down by these two (cf. Plut. de Mal. H. 21, and App. XVI, \u00a7 10); but the fragment breaks off suddenly. This tradition may well be true in the main, though the chronology is inaccurate. For his connexion with the Lycurgean discipline cf. c. 65 n. He was reckoned as one of the Seven Sages (cf. 27. 2 n.), and Plut. (Mor. 35 F) says a collection of his pithy sayings was extant. Cf. vii. 235. 2 for his practical wisdom. tw=| lo/gw|, 'making himself the champion of the cause of'; lo/gos is partly the 'account' to be taken of his partisans, partly what could be urged in their favour. Stein thinks there is an implied opposition to e)/rgw|, 'nominally' he was for others, really for himself; but this is forced. Myres (A. and C. p. 165) says: 'the phrase suggests that it was not a district, but a region that was in question\u2014a region above the corn level.' He adds that any one from the Acropolis in spring can 'recognize the abrupt change from emerald green to purple and brown, which tells where pedi/on and cornland end, and the goats of the u(pera/kria begin'. The rise of these factions was the natural result of the Solonian changes, which had broken down the traditional rule of the Eupatridae. The local divisions, on which the factions were largely based, are reflected in the myth of the four sons of Pandion (Strabo, 392); but no doubt the main struggle was between the old landed aristocracy and the rising mercantile class. The parali/a is the southern half of Attica, the triangle terminating in Sunium, the pedi/on is the south-west of Attica, the basin of the Cephissus and the silver mines'. Ure (Origin of the Tyrannis, J. H. S. xxvi. 136) suggests that the *dia/krioi are not local, but are 'the mining population of Attica' supporting 'the great mine-owner, Pisistratus'. But, not to speak of the evidence of Thucydides (u. s.), there is no reason to think that any large section of the Athenian population was employed in the mines at this time, even if free men ever worked there, which is very doubtful; Solon, fr. 13. 49-50, quoted by Ure, refers to manufactures not to mines. H. differs from A. P. 13. 4 in making the third faction later than the rest (it certainly would be organized later); he also gives its name differently, u(pera/krioi, not dia/krioi (cf. Plut. Sol. 29 for the latter form). For Megacles cf. the story of Agariste's wooing, vi 126 seq.; for the Alcmaeonid family cf. 60. 2 n.; his great-niece was the mother of Pericles, whose second son was called 'Paralus'. Lycurgus was an Eteobutad; to this aristocratic faction belonged the Philaidae; cf. vi. 35 seq. for the story of their chief, Miltiades. The faction of Pisistratus was in east and north-east Attica; his own deme, *filai+/dai (Plut. Sol. 10), lay near Brauron some twenty miles south of Marathon; cf. c. 62 for his strength in this region. Near Brauron was discovered the sth/lh of an Aristion, who may well be (Bury, pp. 192-3) the man of that name who proposed (A. P. 14. 1) the tyrant's bodyguard. dh=qen shows the statement is false; cf. 73. 5. The poluqru/lhton ai)/thma (Plat. Rep. 566 B) for a bodyguard was the first step to tyranny. strathgi/h|. H. probably uses this word in a non-technical sense, but even if he meant it to be technical, it would prove nothing; he is often anachronistic in his constitutional details; cf. vi. 109 n. There is no evidence for the existence of the strathgoi/ before Cleisthenes, except in the more than suspicious 'Constitution of Draco' (A. P. 4); if they existed, they were mere subordinates of the Polemarch. For the tyrant owing his rise to distinction in war cf. Ar. Pol. v. 5. 6-8 (1305 A) with Newman's note. For the chronology of the wars with Megara cf. Busolt, ii. 217 seq. Some (e. g. Sayce) have supposed that H. makes here a mistake similar to that as to Croesus and Solon (cf. c. 29 nn.), introducing Pisistratus into a war that really belongs to the previous generation. Others (e. g. Beloch, i. 327) make Pisistratus the conqueror of Salamis, not Solon; but apart from Solon's own poems (frags. 2 and 3) all tradition gives the conquest to the older man. It is more natural therefore to suppose that the Megarian war, victoriously ended by Solon (Plut. Sol. 10), had been renewed during the confusion at Athens that followed his legislation (cf. A. P. 13), or perhaps even before his legislation, as Plutarch (c. 12) definitely states, and that the struggle with Megara was finally ended by Pisistratus; Justin, ii. 8, describes the capture of Nisaea by him, though without naming the town. The inscription discovered in 1884 may perhaps refer to the settlement of Salamis after the conquest by Pisistratus; but others date it at the end of the sixth century (cf. Hicks, pp. 6-7; Busolt, ii. 444 n. 2). These 'clubmen' (korunhfo/roi), fifty in number (Plut. Sol. 30), were not called by the usual name of a tyrant's guard, dorufo/roi. a)kro/polin. Cf. Mayor, Juv. x. 307 n., for this first step to tyranny Pisistratus was unlike the usual tyrant (iii. 80. 5), cf. App. XVI. 5. H. forms a just estimate of the home, but not of the foreign (App. XVI. 8) policy of Pisistratus. The timai/ are the members of the two Councils and the translates 'harassed by the attacks of his own party', and cf. 61. 2; but 'troubled by the party strife' is simpler. The willingness of the Alcmaeonid family to marry with, and to restore, a tyrant is very inconsistent with their character as 'tyranthaters' in vi. 121, 123; cf. App. XVIII. 6. e)pei/ is to be taken closely with to/te ge, 'at that time when the Greek race had long been separated.' It is noticeable that here, as elsewhere, H. holds inconsistent views as to the Pelasgi; they are 'barbarians', but they become Hellenes without difficulty. The story of the sham Athene is one of the most curious in H.; he is shocked by it, and introduces sarcastic touches (e.g. sxh=ma oi(=o/n ti e)/melle) into it; but he completely believes it. Grote has an excellent note (iv. 32) on the contrast between the views of the sixth and of the fifth century, implied in H.'s criticism here; he compares the contrast of views as to a combat of champions in H. i. 82 and Thuc. v. 41. As H. had met possibly the sons and certainly the grandsons of men who had seen the restoration, and as he carefully sifted his traditions as to the Pisistratidae (cf. v. 55. 1 n.), it is safer to accept the story, as e. g. Grote, Curtius, Busolt (ii. 321), and others do. Cf. vi. 105. 3 for Athenian acceptance of the supernatural (Pan and Philippides). Somewhat similar acts are that of Telines (vii. 153) and the share of St. Catherine in the return of Gregory XI to Rome in 1376. Beloch, however (Rh. Mus. 45, 1890, whom Meyer, F. ii. 248, follows), rejects the whole story as a 'poetic variation of the historic tradition of the victory at Pallene'. The argument is as follows: the victory was gained at the temple of Athene Pallenis (c. 62. 3); hence Athene was metaphorically said to have restored Pisistratus. The metaphorical version grew into a myth, perhaps with the assistance of a commemorative monument\u2014this suggestion had been made by Stein before Beloch\u2014and then the fiction found a place in history, side by side with the real fact. Beloch concludes that Pisistratus was only restored once and expelled once, and that the intrigue with Megacles belongs to the first usurpation. It argues almost greater credulity to suppose that history and myth could become thus inextricably mixed in the course of two generations than to accept the story of Phya. It may be noted that there is independent fourth-century evidence for the story in A. P. 14. 4 and in Cleidemus (Athen. 609 C; F. H. G. i. 364), who makes Phya wife of Hipparchus. This passage is very significant for Greek stature: this 'daughter of the gods divinely tall and most divinely fair', was only about 5 feet 10 inches. panopli/h|: i. e. with helmet, breastplate, spear, and shield, as in the familiar Athene statues; cf. iv. 180. 3 for the investing of a mortal with these attributes of Athene. The demes were pre-Cleisthenean, though he gave them political importance (v. 69. 2 n.); here and in 62. 1 they = 'the country dis tricts' as opposed to to\\ a)/stu; they were the strongholds of Pisistratus, who had the peasants on his side, as opposed to the landowners and the trading class; cf. 59. 3 n. prsaide/ato, 'were under obligations to'; cf. iii. 140. 2. The friendship of the Thebans for the Athenian tyrant is very noticeable; the continuous rivalry of the two great cities in middle Greece through the fifth century was the result of the diplomacy of Cleomenes; cf. vi. 108 nn. For Lygdamis cf. Ar. Pol. v. 6. 1, 1305 a 41, with Newman's note; he had become tyrant as leader of the people in avenging an aristocratic outrage (Athen. 348). Apparently he lost his tyranny (this is implied here) and was restored by Pisistratus (64. 2). If we may trust Polyaenus (i. 23) he had assisted Polycrates to obtain the tyranny of Samos, thus forming a link between the two great Ionian tyrants. He seems to combine the two characters of democratic champion and well-born condottiere. For his fall cf. 'Plut.' de Mal. Hdt. c. 21. For the curse cf. v. 71 n. H. gives two notes of time as to the Pisistratid rule, in this passage and in v. 65. 3 (that it lasted thirty-six years): Aristotle (Pol. v. 12. 5, 1315 b 32) gives it thirty-five years, and to Pisistratus himself seventeen; A. P. 17. 1 gives him nineteen years. There are numerous other data in A. P. cc. 14-17, but they are hopelessly confused; see Sandys on A. P. 14. 3 for a discussion of the subject. The ultra-sceptical view is that of Beloch (i. 328), that the traditional dates are merely based on calculations of generations, one for Pisistratus himself and a half for his sons, i. e. 33+17 = 50 years in all, and that one-half of his rule is given to exile. Rejecting this argument as a not very probable guess, we may take the following dates as approximate: First tyranny, 560-559, archonship of Comeas (this traditional date is accepted even by Beloch). First exile, 555. Second tyranny, 550. Second exile, 549. Third tyranny, 539. Death, 527. Expulsion of Hippias, 510 (Thuc. vi. 59. 4). But certainty is impossible. *maraqw=nos. In the Diacria where his party was strong. Cf. 59. 3 n. e)s tw)uto\\ sunio/ntes, 'intending to join battle.' Pallene lay south of Mount Pentelicus, commanding the pass between it and Hymettus; here the road from Marathon on the north-east joins that from Brauron on the south-east of Athens. The place was the scene of the mythical battles between the Athenians and Eurystheus (Strabo, 377) and between Theseus and Pallas (Plut. Thes. 13); this latter battle, like the one here (cf. the oracle), was decided by a surprise. For *qei/h| pomph=| xrew/menos cf. iii. 77. 1; iv. 152. 2; H. obviously looks on P. as favoured of heaven. *amfi/lutos o( *)akarna/n. Some propose to read o( *)axarneu/s, because Plato (Theag. 124 D) calls him h(medapo/s, i. e. an Athenian; but the Acarnanian mountaineers were famous seers (cf. vii. 221, Megistias, and the prevalence of second-sight among the Scotch Highlanders). Stein suggests that Pisistratus may have given him citizenship, and compares for this ix. 33 seq. xrhsmolo/gos (cf. vii. 6. 3) may mean either the seer himself or the collector of oracles (cf. Thuc. ii. 8. 2). The Pisistratidae were closely connected with oracles (cf. e)k tw=n logi/wn 64. 2) and seers; they had a collection of oracles (v. 90. 2), and were friendly with Onomacritus the Orphic teacher (vii. 6. 3 n.). Pisistratus himself was nicknamed Bacis (Schol. Aristoph. Peace 1071). This connexion, like their temple-building and encouragement of cult, was a convenient support of their rule (cf. App. XVI, \u00a7 7). a)/riston: here the midday meal; the 'siesta' or games follow it. a)nabiba/sas. Helbig (Les *(ippei=s Ath\u00e9niens, p. 191) thinks the phrase indicates that the young men were serving as mounted hoplites, not as cavalry; he thinks (p. 231 seq.) Athens had no real cavalry till the period 478-457 B. C. A. P. 15. 3 mentions a general disarmament. This seems hardly consistent with Thuc. vi. 56, 58. The passage here gives two of the distinguishing marks of a tyranny, direct taxation of citizens and a mercenary force. suno/doisi is rare for proso/doisi. au)to/qen: the reference is to the mines of Laurium and to the land-tax of 10 per cent. (A. P. 16. 4), reduced by P.'s sons to 5 per cent. (Thuc. vi. 54. 5). *strumo/nos. A. P. 15. 2 tells us that Pisistratus during his second exile made money from the regions round Mount Pangaeus', i. e. near Amphipolis, where Philippi was founded later. The mines here are to be distinguished from those of *skapth\\ *(/glh opposite Thasos, and owned by that island (vi. 46. 3). The mention of the Thraceward 'revenues' agrees with the conjecture, probable on other grounds, that Thucydides the historian, who had possessions in that region (iv. 105. 1), was connected with the Pisistratidae; but cf. Grundy. Thucydides, p. 16. For a tyrant's hostages cf. iii. 45. 4. For Delos cf. vi. 97 n., and App. XVI, \u00a7 8 for general foreign policy of Pisistratus. met' *)alkmewnide/wn. As Alcmaeon was agent of Croesus (vi. 125), there were other reasons than those given by H. (59. 1, 65. 1) for Croesus not seeking Athenian alliance. A digression on Lacedaemonian history, containing accounts of (1) Lycurgus (c. 65), (2) the foundation of the Lacedaemonian hegemony, especially the war with Tegea. (For the questions as to Lycurgus cf. especially Meyer, F. i. 213-86.) I. Lycurgus a 'heroized god'. The historical reality of Lycurgus is often denied (e.g. by Meyer (u. s.); Busolt, i. 578; Gilbert, G. C. A. p. 15; Bury, p. 135) because: 1. The evidence for him is late; apart from Simonides (Plut. Lyc. 1) H. is our oldest witness; the fragments of Tyrtaeus never mention him; yet it is equally hard to believe either that Tyrtaeus would have said nothing of Lycurgus, had he ever existed, or that any mention of him by Tyrtaeus, had there been one, would have failed to be quoted when the subject was so much discussed. 2. The statements as to Lycurgus are contradictory (cf. 65. 4 for variations of date); and his work was attributed by Hellanicus to Eurysthenes and Procles (Fr. 91; F. H. G. i. 57). 3. His name (i. e. 'Wolfheart', Meyer, u. s. 281, or 'LightWorker', Gilbert) is suspicious, as are also those of his father (Eunomus or Prytanis, Plut. 1), and of his son (Eucosmus, Paus. iii. 16. 5). 4. He was worshipped as a god at Sparta (v. i.), and Meyer (ii. 277) denies that we find mortals deified in Greece before Alexander; but this is doubtful. 5. Greek legends tended to ascribe all institutions to some lawgiver; cf. Solon, Zaleucus, &c. 'strange Greek superstition'; 'they have no sufficient conception of the way in which things are stronger than men, and the passive resistance of circumstances stronger than the insight and will of an individual' (Oncken, Arist. Staats.-Lehre, i. 244-5). Meyer (F. i. 279) goes so far as to suggest that the legend of Lycurgus as founder grew up 'gradually after the Persian wars, when the Spartans became conscious of the peculiar character of their native institutions'. He is 'borrowed from the original population, like the cults of Helen, the Dioscuri, and Agamemnon' (ib. p. 282). Hence Lyc. is a 'heroized divinity'; Gilbert makes him a form of Apollo *au/keios, Meyer (ib. 282, following Wilamowitz) and Busolt an Arcadian Grote, Curtius, Holm, and others, however, make II. Lycurgus a real man. 1. Because of the analogy of similar legends; Charlemagne, Roland, and Archbishop Turpin are historical persons, however much their story was embellished in the Chansons de Geste (cf. the discussion as to the historical existence of King Arthur, E. B. ii9. 651). 2. The peculiar character of Spartan institutions is best explained by the dominating personality of some individual, who did not invent them, but who systematized them and rendered them permanent. Holm (i. 188) well compares the part played by the Doge Gradenigo in settling the Venetian constitution, Reich the foundation by great personalities of the religious orders in the Roman Church. III. Lycurgus a historical fiction. A further difficulty arises from the archaeological discoveries of the British School at Sparta since 1906: these show that the city was a centre of art down to after 600 B.C., and then almost suddenly ceases to be so. It is possible that the Lycurgean a)gwgh/ actually dates from this period, and was the work of a reformer (perhaps of Chilon, cf. 59. 2 n.), who attributed his drastic innovations to a supposed ancient founder, or that at any rate an old and weakly enforced discipline was reintroduced in a stricter form. (For this latter view cf. Dickins in Class. Quart. v. 241.) Such a view would account for the absence of genuine tradition as to Lycurgus, while it satisfies the main argument for his existence, viz. that a strong personality is needed to explain so peculiar a development. If, however, we accept the personality of Lycurgus (Frazer, v. 606, goes so far as to say 'It should never have been called in question'), it must be admitted that we know nothing of him; H.'s account is not real history; it is only valuable as the fifth century official Lacedaemonian account of history. (See Note D, p. 449.) Leon, father of Anaxandridas and grandfather of Cleomenes, and Agasicles, father of Ariston and grandfather of Demaratus, ruled between 600 and 560 B.C. 'The other wars' are probably (1) those connected with the overthrow of the Cypselidae after 585 and of other tyrants (cf. Thuc. i. 18. 1), (2) those against Argos and (in alliance with Elis) those against Pisa (cf. Busolt, i. 705-6). kai/ introduces the second cause of Lacedaemonian hegemony, i. e. they had overcome their difficulties; they had recently defeated Tegea, and they had 'also' before this got a good constitution. Thuc. (u. s.) seems to refer to this passage; he dates the change 'a little more than four hundred years before' 404 B.C.; but he pointedly omits Lycurgus. a)pro/smeiktoi. The exclusiveness of Sparta is made pre-Lycurgean; this is doubtful; H. makes the Minyae to be received (iv. 145) as citizens in the earliest days; in the seventh century the Ionic Epos and Aeolic music came in (cf. the stories of Terpander and Alcman). It was only in the sixth century that exclusiveness was intensified or more probably introduced. The oracle as quoted in Diodorus (vii. 12) ends with the For his i(ero/n cf. 66. 1 n.; Plutarch qu/ousin w(s qew=|) speaks of his divine honours; he is mentioned as a god in inscriptions, e. g. C. I. G. 1256. But all this does not disprove his original humanity. It is worth while to tabulate the more important differences between the Herodotean and the other accounts of Lycurgus: 1. H. denies that he derived his institutions from Delphi; but this was the usual fourth century account, e. g. Xen. Rep. Lac. viii. 5 and Plat. Leg. 624; cf. 691 E. Meyer (F. i. 231 seq.) ingeniously ascribes this later view to King Pausanias (408-395 B. C.), and maintains that the verses of Tyrtaeus (Plut. Lyc. 6) which assert it are a later forgery. 2. H. makes Lycurgus guardian of Leobotes, his nephew, i. e. he is an Agiad and his date is about 1000 B.C. But Simonides (Plut. Lyc. 1) makes him a Eurypontid and uncle of Charilaus (king 884 B. C.); so too Ar. Pol. ii. 10. 2, 1271 B. Plut. (ib.) also quotes Aristotle for a third date, i. e. Lycurgus is put in the eighth century, and made to organize 'the Olympic Truce' (on the strength of the inscription on 'the quoit at Olympia'). No wonder Timaeus thought there were two Lycurgi. 3. H. makes him legislate as regent, Ephorus (Strabo, 482) at a time when Charilaus was actually king. 4. H. gives him the whole Spartan constitution; but v. i. for other dates for the Ephorate and Gerousia. It may be added that the one point on which traditions agree, viz. that he legislated as uncle of the king, was an obvious guess; for his name was not on the royal list, and yet men felt he must have been a Heracleid. ko/smon. The well-known Spartan a)gwgh/ is implied; H. gives this to Lycurgus as a matter of course. For a comparison of the institutions of Sparta and of Crete cf. Ar. Pol. ii. 10 (1271 B seq.). Ephorus (Strabo, 481-2) argued elaborately for the priority of Crete; but his view as to the similarity of the two constitutions is criticized by Polybius (vi. 45-6); there is not sufficient evidence to decide the question. The institutions are in each case the expression of 'the warrior life of a conquering primitive people' (Oncken) surrounded by enemies and hostile subjects. e)fu/lace. The 'security' was an oath to observe the laws till his return (Plut. Lyc. 29); this is probably borrowed from the story as to Solon (c. 29. 2). So, too, the statement that he travelled is considered by some to be an invention copied from the genuine travels of the Athenian. The e)nwmoti/h, i. e. 'sworn brotherhood', was the smallest tactical unit of the army, containing in 418 B.C. about thirty-two men (Thuc. v. 68. 3), at Leuctra 'not more than thirty-six' (Xen. Hell. vi. 4. 12); but the number no doubt varied. trihka/das, 'companies of thirty.' For conjectures as to their nature of. Hermann, Staats-A. i. 197. n. 4; perhaps the word is a gloss to explain e)nwmoti/a (a case of 'obscurum per obscurius'). The number 'thirty' occurs again in Sparta in the Senate, and perhaps in the number of the The sussi/tia were originally military organizations, the band of warriors united by the common meal. e)fo/rous. Three views are taken as to H.'s statements about the Ephors and the Gerousia: (1) That both statements are right; Ephors and Gerousia were part of the primitive constitution, and so associated with Lycurgus. Cf. Xen. Rep. Lac. c. 8 for Ephors, c. 10 for Gerousia; Isocrates, Panath. 165-6. Meyer (F. i. 246) accepts this view; holding that Lycurgus has no historical reality, he identifies his supposed institutions with the primitive constitution. (2) That the first is right and the second wrong. Clearly the ge/rontes are the old council of chiefs and pre-Lycurgean; but the Ephors may be definite officers, created by Lycurgus to superintend the a)gwgh/. (3) That both statements are wrong. The Ephorate is assigned to a date later than Lycurgus, i. e. the reign of Theopompus: for (a) Aristotle (Pol. v. 11. 2, 1313 A) tells the story of his answer that he left the kingship ela/ttwn but poluxroniwte/ra (cf. Plat. Leg. 692; 10). (b) The list of ephors begins 755-754 B.C., i. e. in the reign of Theopompus (but this date, if it be historical at all, might refer to an alteration in the power of an old office). Meyer (F. i. 250) argues that the post-Lycurgean date for the Ephorate is due to King Pausanias (cf. 65. 4 n.) and the constitutional struggles at Sparta early in the fourth century. Owing to the authority of Aristotle (u. s.), it displaced the earlier view and was generally adopted. All we can say for certain is that (1) the Ephorate is found in the colonies of Thera, Cyrene, and the Tarentine Heraclea, and so may have been an early institution in Sparta, their reputed mhtro/polis (but cf. iv. 145 nn.); (2) that the office was closely connected with the a)gwgh/. For the whole subject of the Ephorate cf. Busolt, i. 555 seq. oi(=a dh\\ qew=|; this is implied in i(ro/n; a hero had only a te/menos or a h(rw=|on; Frazer (P. ii. 153-4) gives the differences; the h(rw=|on faced west not east, and e)nagi/zein (not qu/ein) is used for the sacrifices in it, i. e. the worship was chthonian, not celestial. *)arka/dwn. The earlier Arcadian war is important as a turningpoint in the policy of the Lacedaemonians; the stubborn resistance of the highlanders of Central Peloponnese made them give up attempting complete conquest (which they had carried out in Messenia), and be content with a hegemony over dependent allies. Pausanias (iii. 7. 3 et al.) puts this war in the time of Charilaus (884-824); but it really belongs to the beginning of the sixth century (65. 1). The Arcadians were considered (probably rightly, cf. the survival of the Iberian Basques in the Pyrenees) as of the race of the aboriginal Pelasgians (viii. 73. 1 n.); hence the epithet 'acorneating', which implies a primitive civilization (cf. Lucr. v. 939) before the days of agriculture. Cf. the epithet prose/lhnoi, Tegea lay in the southern part of the great eastern plain of Arcadia. Being surrounded with hills (Frazer, P. iv. 422), it is compared to an o)rxh/stra: so Epaminondas called Apoph. Imper. 18). sxoi/nw|. The reference to allotments is proof of land assignment as an early Spartan institution. The later story that the land was divided equally by Lycurgus (cf. Plut. Lyc. 8) is a manifest fiction; but the poem of Tyrtaeus, quoted by Aristotle (Pol. v. 7. 4, 1307 A 2), refers to the fact that h)ci/oun a)na/daston poiei=n th\\n xw/ran. Early Sparta, like early Rome, had agrarian troubles, and solved them in the same way\u2014at the expense of its neighbours. ki/bdhlos: properly of false coin; used by H. especially of oracles (cf. 75. 2; v. 91. 2). There is a double meaning in the 'juggling' oracle (cf.

Again the land might be 'measured' (diametrh/sasqai) by the Lacedaemonians as conquerors or as captives. pe/das. No doubt the 'temple of Athena Alea' was the source of the story; Pausanias (viii. 47. 2) saw the fetters there in the second century A. D. For the 'fetters' as evidence of Lacedaemonian overconfidence cf. similar story of Armada (but see Froude, xii. 380). For this temple cf. H. ix. 70. 3; it was burned in 395 B.C. (Paus. viii. 45), but restored on a magnificent scale with sculptures by Scopas, Frazer, P. iv. 425-6. For the name 'Alea' cf. Farnell, C. G. S. i. 274. The traditional dates for Anaxandridas and Ariston are 560-520; 560-510. This second Arcadian war (circ. 550 B.C.) is historical; but it is interesting to see that H.'s account is made up of oracles and legendary details (cf. the similar account of the first Aeginetan war, v. 82-7, which is a little earlier in date). Perhaps there is a confusion between the famous Orestes and an Arcadian hero Oresthes (cf. ix. 11. 2 n.*)ore/sqeion). Pausanias (viii. 5. 3) makes the former migrate from Mycenae to Tegea, but this is probably a late invention. The discovery of supposed relics is no doubt a fact; we may compare the legend as to Alexander's body (Ael. V. H. xii. 64), and the removal of the bones of Theseus to Athens (circ. 470 B.C.; Plut. Cim. 8). The present translation is the consecration of the Lacedaemonian hegemony in Peloponnese, as the later one is that of Athenian hegemony in the Aegean. For the work of Delphi in unifying local cults cf. Paus. viii. 9. 2 (the translation of the bones of Arcas from Maenalus). Two ideas underlie the Lacedaemonian policy: (1) They were consciously aiming at identification with Achaean traditions (cf. v. 72. 3, vii. 159). (2) The local hero's remains were the talisman that secured the land's security (cf. Soph. O. C. 1522 for their concealment, and Tylor, P. C.4 ii. 150). The discovery of gigantic fossil bones (Frazer, P. ii. 483) probably is the origin of this and similar stories; the almost mediaeval character of the tradition (cf. the translation of St. Mark's relics to Venice in the ninth century) reminds us how far removed from their predecessors and from the mass of their countrymen were the rationalist Athenians of the fifth century and later. kai\\ tu/pos ktl.: here the 'sound' is 'the echo of the sense'. ph=ma: a reference in part to the idea that the iron age was the last and worst; but also (cf. 68. 4) to the fact that iron is the material of deadly weapons. e)pita/rroqos. The finder of the hero's bones would by their aid become the helper, i. e. 'patron' of Tegea. The Spartan royal bodyguard were called *(ippei=s, although we only hear of them serving on foot; we are expressly told (Strabo, 481) that they differed from the Cretan i(ppei=s in having no horses; the name is a survival from early times (cf. h(ni/oxoi and paraba/tai in Theban Sacred Band (Diod. xii. 70) for a like survival). This is more probable than that they were mounted infantry, like the early Athenian i(ppei=s (cf. 63. 2 n.), who used horses as a means of transport, but fought on foot. There was no genuine cavalry in Laconia till 424 B. C., when para\\ to\\ ei)wqo/s (Thuc. iv. 55. 2) a corps of 400 horsemen was set up. The Spartan 'horsemen' were three hundred in number, cf. vii. 205. 2 (though this corps at Thermopylae was perhaps specially selected), viii. 124. 3; Thuc. v. 72. 4. In vi. 56 the king's bodyguard is only one hundred. H. seems to imply that they served by rotation; perhaps thirty were enrolled each year, one from each w)bh/. Some see in this the explanation of trihka/s (65. 5); if this be so, perhaps the five seniors among those serving their last year were a)gaqoergoi/ and had civil functions. Xenophon (Rep. Lac. iv. 3) speaks of a special body of three hundred, chosen each year by three i(ppagre/tai, nominated by the ephors; if these three hundred are the 'knights', the change in method of election may be a mark of the increased power of the ephors in later times. e)pimeici/hs.

This is the earliest instance of the recognition of Lacedaemonian headship in Greece. Later instances, chronologically arranged, are: i. 152 (Ionians, c. 546 B.C. In the same cap. the Lacedaemonians themselves also claim it); vi. 108 (the Plataeans, 519 B. C., but vid. n. ad loc.); iii. 148 (Maeandrius, c. 514 B. C.); vi. 84 (the Scythians); v. 49 (Athens against Aegina, 491 B. C.). All these lead up to the recognized hegemony against Xerxes, vii. 161. 2; viii. 2. 2. Thornax lay to north of Sparta (Frazer, P. iii. 322). Pausanias (iii. 10. 8) says the gold was used to decorate the statue of Apollo Pythaeus at Amyclae, which was similar to that at Thornax but more important; he describes (iii. 19. 2) it as a brazen pillar about 45 ft. high, with head, feet, and hands, i.e. it was a primitive cultstatue, marking transition from the aniconic age. zw/|dia = zw=|a, 'figures', not of animals alone, in relief round the rim: H. had seen it in the Heraeum (cf. iii. 47. 1 n.). Story of Croesus resumed (after digressions of cc. 56-70). By the story of Sandanis H. illustrates dramatically, after his manner, the contrast between the simplicity of the early Persians (Strabo, 734) and the luxury of the older kingdoms; in his own day (cf. \u00a7 4 *pe/rsh|si ga/r ktl.) the Persians had become notorious for luxury (cf. c. 135). Such contrasts are characteristic of Oriental history (cf. the Moguls in India). skuti/nas. For Persian dress cf. c. 135 nn. ou) su=ka de/, 'not even figs,' the commonest fruit in the East. For *kappado/kai cf. 6. 3 n. H. rightly recognizes the importance of the Halys, which is the ethnic frontier in Asia Minor (cf. App. I, \u00a7 1); its change in direction from south-west to north-west is implied in a)/nw; it rises in 'Little Armenia'. The Armenians, who were *frugw=n a)/poikoi (vii. 73), had already spread beyond the Halys. For H.'s Cilicia cf. iii. 90. 3 n. *matihnou/s. The passages as to the Matieni may be summarized as follows (cf. T. Reinach, R. E. G. vii. (1894) 313 seq.): (1) They are placed on the south-west of the Caspian, though not touching it (Strabo, 514; in 509 S. puts them in Media), but had originally a greater extension to the south-west; so Xanthus, fr. 3 (F. H. G. i. 36) places L. Urmiah (L. Matianus) among them. (2) This wider sense is the usual one in H.; the Matieni (iii. 94. 1), are grouped with the Saspeires (south-east of Trapezus) and the Alarodii (in valley of Araxes) in the eighteenth satrapy; so the Araxes rises e)k *matihnw=n (202. 3). (3) But their name extends even more widely, e.g. Mount Zagros = 'Matienian Mountains' (189. 1), and in v. 49. 6, 52. 4-5 Matiene fills the whole space between Armenia and Susiana, and is crossed by the Royal Road in thirty-four stages; i. e. it includes what H. elsewhere calls 'Assyria', and = modern Turkish and Persian Kurdistan. But H. is inconsistent: for in v. 52. 4 he makes the Greater Zab rise in Armenia, though its source, being south-east of that of the Araxes, should be in Matiene. (4) Quite different is the meaning in the passage here and in vii. 72. 2, which put the Matieni on the bend of the Halys, near the Paphlagonians. Reinach conjectures they were once a widespread race, reaching from the Halys to near the Caspian; but they were cut in two by Armenian immigration, and so survived at two ends of their former home; perhaps they may = the 'Mitani' of Tell-El-Amarna tablets. Of the four uses of *matihnoi/ (2) is the official name, while (3) is the older geographical name of the whole region. *suri/ous *kappado/kas. H. sometimes puts the general name first (as here and in vi. 20), sometimes the special name (*)arka/des *pelasgoi/ 146. 1). pe/nte: this estimate is repeated ii. 34. 2, where Sinope is given as the northern limit; but the distance from Sinope to the Mediterranean is about 350 miles, while Asia Minor is 300 miles across where narrowest. Moreover, the route across Asia Minor is through difficult country. Similarly Pliny (N. H. vi. 7) gives the distance as '200 miles'. Some suppose that H. has confused with the ordinary time for the journey the 'record' of Persian couriers (cf. viii. 98. 2 for their relays). Pheidippides (vi. 106. 1) is credited with about 140 miles in two days, and Rawlinson (ad hunc loc.) says a modern Persian courier covers 50 miles a day. But H. is speaking simply of an eu)/zwnos, i. e. expeditus, and he elsewhere calculates a day's journey at 200 stadia, i.e. about 23 miles (iv. 101. 3). We can explain the mistake easily if we suppose that H. misunderstood his informant; it was 'about five days' journey' from Sinope to the northern boundary of the Persian Cilicia (iii. 90. 3); H. took the distance as referring to the southern boundary. Meyer (ii. 287) thinks the mistake proves that there was a direct road across Asia Minor here. H. is followed in the mistake by the pseudo-Scylax (Per. 102). gambro/s is any connexion by marriage, here a 'brother-in-law' (74. 4); H. as usual gives a personal motive; for other reasons cf. 46. 1 n. The story may be true in outline (cf. Morier, J. R. G. S. vii. 242, for wars in the East caused by nomad migrations). No doubt many Scyths remained in Media, when the main body had been expelled or annihilated (106. 1 n.). The story of the Thyestean banquet (\u00a7 5), however, is suspiciously reminiscent of the story of Harpagus (c. 119) and of the myth of Tantalus. For the Scythian bow cf. iv. 9. 5 n.; cf. Plat. Leg. 795 A, who says the S. were ambidextrous in its use, and Jer. v. 16 'their quiver is an open sepulchre'. Night battles were rare in ancient warfare (cf. Thuc. vii. 44, the attack on Epipolae); this one is not the 'eclipse battle' (v. i.). This date is one of the few definite points in the history of the period; it is fixed as May 28, 585, by the astronomers; the other eclipse of the period, that on Sept. 30, 610, was only partial in Asia Minor. The later date (585) is given by Plin. (N. H. ii. 53) and (approximately) by the ancient chronologers, Eusebius and Jerome. It suits also the circumstances: (1) The fall of Nineveh c. 606 had enabled Cyaxares to extend his power north-west, and so brought him into contact with Lydia. (2) Labynetus (i.e. Nebuchadnezzar) did not begin his reign till 604. It used to be argued (e.g. by Stein) that H., because Cyaxares was conqueror of the Scyths, had wrongly introduced him here, and that Astyages began to reign in 594 B.C. But the revised Median chronology (App. III, \u00a7 6) makes all the dates nine years later, and so the account in H. becomes possible. Thales is the Merlin or Michael Scott of Greek sixth-century tradition. It has been maintained that this prediction is impossible, in view of what we know of his scientific theories; Stein thinks that he can only have explained the phenomenon afterwards. But H., who rejects the story as to his engineering (75. 6), accepts this one. Thales' prediction may have been based on Chaldean calculations (cf. Burnet, Early Gk. Phil. 35). (See Note E, p. 450.) sumbiba/santes. No doubt the mediating princes were glad to limit the dangerous growth of Cyaxares' power. Syennesis (like 'Pharaoh') is a title (probably Semitic) borne by the native rulers of Cilicia (v. 118. 2; vii. 98); they seem to have submitted voluntarily to Cyrus, and so were allowed to retain their kingdom (cf. App. VI, \u00a7 7); they were dependent or independent as the central power was strong or weak (ix. 107 n.). The dynasty disappears at the beginning of the fourth century. For Labynetus cf. App. II, \u00a7 5. e)pallagh/n. We know of no Median queen in Lydia; the 'mutual' element may have been furnished by Nebuchadnezzar's marriage with a Median princess (c. 185 n.). a)nagkai/hs = necessitudo; ancient diplomacy believed as firmly as modern in marriage alliances, and with as little reason.

For this promise fulfilled ta\\s e)ou/sas, 'the (then) existing bridges': for a bridge on the Great Road cf. v. 52. 2. Garstang (Hitt. p. 28) places the bridge near Cheshme Keupru, where the road from Caesarea to Angora recrosses the river. For final use of optative with a)/n (Homeric) cf. Goodwin, M. and T. p. 117 (ed. 1889). kata/: not 'near' but 'on the line of'. For H.'s rough attempt to construct geographical 'parallels' cf. ii. 34. 1 and App. XIII, \u00a7 4. Pteria is probably Boghaz Keui, within the bend of the Halys (lat. 40\u00b0), about 60 miles north-east of the bridge; the exploration of the ruins began by Winckler in 1906 has brought to light a mass of tablets in cuneiform script, partly in Babylonian, partly in a language as yet untranslated (cf. King and Hall, pp. 468 seq.); they include fragments of diplomatic correspondence with Egypt and the East, of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries B.C. The 'Royal Road' (cf. v. 52 nn.) crossed at Pteria the road running north and south from Sinope, via Mazaca and the Cilician gates, to Tarsus (Ramsay, A. M. p. 33). The early importance of Pteria probably determined the direction of both these roads, neither of which follows the easiest line for a through route. It seems to have been the capital of an Anatolian kingdom which we may call 'Hittite'; for the history of this cf. Garstang, Hitt. pp. 315 seq.; for a description of the ruins of Pteria, ib. p. 197 seq., well illustrated with photographs. H. emphasizes the guilt of Croesus as aggressor, to justify his later overthrow (cf. 130. 3). Garstang (pp. 33, 199) seems to think that the Hittite power survived till the capture of Pteria by Croesus, but this is very doubtful. Later writers (Just. i. 7; Polyae. vii. 8) say that Croesus was defeated. H.'s story may be due to Lydian vanity, but is probable in itself. Croesus found he had advanced too far; perhaps he had expected Egyptian co-operation at Pteria; at any rate he may well have thought that Cyrus would not attack him, with Babylon and Egypt hostile in flank and rear. *labu/nhtos.

The Lydian kings depended for infantry on Greeks and Carians; the Lydians were horsemen (77. 3). This disbanding may be an invention; but Croesus, not expecting to be attacked, may have wished to save the expense of an army through the winter; H. is at least consistent. For the genitive after e)s cf. Plat. Prot. but the tw=n before e)chghte/wn is unusual. There were three places called Telmessus\u2014in Pisidia, in Caria, (about seven miles from Halicarnassus), and in Lycia; probably the last is here meant (cf. 84. 3).

For the interpretation of the well-known struggle in Attica between Poseidon, whose symbol is the horse, and Athene, whose fosterling, Erechtheus, is 'earth-born' and snake-like in form, cf. viii. 41. 2 and J.

For the topography of Sardis cf. Perrot et Chipiez, v. 249-50, and 84. 3 n. Its citadel (tei=xos, \u00a7 6) stood on a spur projecting north from Mount Tmolus, with which it was connected by a low ridge; this rises very sharply to the height of about 600 feet, fully justifying H.'s account of its inaccessibility (c. 84). Round it flow two rivers, the gold-bearing Pactolus on the west, and on the east a perennial stream, H.'s Hyllus. The a)/stu lay on these (84. 5) between the po/lis (84. 3, i.e. the 'citadel') and the rivers. surrhgnu=si gives the personal touch of one who has seen these mountain streams. One branch of the Hermus flows from the Murad Dagh, a ridge west of Pessinus, from which town Cybele's aniconic image was brought to Rome in 204 B.C. On this ridge she was worshipped as 'Dindymene' (Hor. Odes, i. 16. 5); for other local names cf. Strabo, 469, and for another cult-statue of her in high places cf. the 'Niobe' of Mount Sipylus. She had a temple in Sardis (v. 102. 1). For her worship generally cf. App. I, \u00a7 2. For Harpagus cf. 109. 3 n. and App. IV, \u00a7 4. The Lacedaemonian Conquest of Thyrea. The narrative of H. (\u00a7 3 bohqhsa/ntwn) seems to imply that Thyrea was now conquered by the Lacedaemonians for the first time; they had, however, begun their aggressions on Argive territory before this, for H. (vii. 235. 2) implies that Cythera was theirs soon after 600 B. C. The conquest of the east coast may well have been gradual. The chronologers speak of a Lacedaemonian victory in Thyrea under Polydorus in 718 B. C., and Pausanias (iii. 2. 2) puts the conquest of Cynuria down to Echestratus (1059-1025); but these are probably inventions. The Argive chronology seems to have been artificially constructed in periods of fifty years, reckoning back from the Battle of Mantinea in 418; we have 718 as here, and 668, their victory at Hysiae. For a short epitome of Busolt's excellent notes (i. 595-7) on these dates cf. Bury, ii. 468. The Thyreatis remained a bone of contention in the fifth century; for the negotiations of 420 B. C. cf. Thuc. v. 41, with its implied reference to this passage. H. is Elizabethan in his impartial spelling. Cf. *male/wn here with *male/hn of iv. 179. 2. Thyrea was the northern part of Cynuria, which certainly once belonged to Argos (viii. 73. 3 n.). e(spe/rhn. The east coast of Laconia does lie west of Argolis; but H. ignores the fact that it also lies south (for his weakness in orientation cf. vii. 176. 3 n.; ix. 14. ai( loipai/. Several small islands lie off Cythera (Strabo, 363); hence there is no need to see an echo of the well-known line, Il. ii. 108. For the combat of picked warriors cf. ix. 26. 3 and the legend of the Horatii (Liv. i. 25). An historical instance is the conflict on the North Inch of Perth in 1396, so well described in Scott's 'Fair Maid of Perth'. The Spartan three hundred may be the Hippeis (67. 5 n.), but this is very doubtful. Pausanias (x. 9. 12) says the Argives dedicated an offering at Delphi for the victory; but his narrative is inconsistent (Frazer, P. v. 265, 637). katakeira/menoi. The story is suspicious, as it looks like an attempt to explain a difference of custom between kindred peoples; the Greeks originally all wore long hair (ka/rh komo/wntes *)axaioi/), and the conservative Spartans may have retained the custom, which died out elsewhere merely from motives of convenience. Certainly in fifth-century Athens koma=n was a sign of Laconizing (Arist. Av. 1281-2). The custom of cutting the hair as a sign of grief (ii. 36. 1; Il. 23. 141), and of wearing it long as a sign of pride (cf. Absalom), is a well-authenticated one. Cutting the hair and the flesh for mourning (for the combination cf. iv. 71. 2) was forbidden to the Jews (Deut. xiv. 1). The hair was regarded as the symbol of the man; so a priest's tonsure is a sign of dedication. For the whole subject of hair cf. Tylor, P. C. ii. 400 f.; Robertson-Smith, Rel. Sem. p. 323; and Hastings' D. B., s. v. 'Hair'. Pausanias (ii. 20. 7) makes Othryades killed by an Argive. Chrysermus, a Corinthian writer of unknown date, said that he, left on the field seriously wounded, set up a trophy with an inscription in his own blood (F. H. G. iv. 361); this is a mere embellishment on H.'s narrative. For a like capture of Sardis (by Antiochus in 215 B. C.), owing to over-confidence, cf. Polyb. vii. 15 seq. e)sti. H. as an eyewitness uses the present. There were two kings called 'Meles' (Nic. Dam. frags. 24, 49; F. H. G. iii. 371, 382). For the defence of a fortress by magic cf. the burial of King Lud's head at Ludgate (Geoffrey of Monmouth, iii. 20), the removal of which by the over-confidence of a later king enabled Caesar to take London. American explorers have been digging at Sardis since the beginning of 1910. They have discovered a great temple of Artemis, with a dedicatory inscription in Lydian of some length, but so far nothing that throws light on the earlier history of the city. Cf. J. H. S. xxx. 361, xxxi. 301. to\\n le/onta. The germ of the story may be a genuine native myth for the lion was the sacred beast of Sandon, the Lydian sun-god (cf. 50. 3 n.). e)/sti de\\ pro/s, ktl.

The son of Croesus became a proverb for silence, just as Croesus himself did for self-inflicted misfortunes (P. G. ii. 686). a)mfi\\s e)/mmenai = abesse. The chronologers give Croesus fifteen years, but H. does not reckon the last year (as unfinished), perhaps because he wished to bring out the coincidence of the 'fourteen days' and the 'fourteen years'. For the date of the capture of Sardis cf. Busolt, ii. 459-60. The usual date, 546 B.C., is that of Eusebius and most of the chronologers; the Parian marble, however, made it 541, and this date seems to have been that given by Xanthus: between these two dates it is impossible to decide. Duncker (iv. 326) put it in 549, as he thought it must have preceded (cf. 90. 4) the burning of the Delphic temple (548, 50. 3 n.), but this conjecture has not been generally accepted. As to the fate of Croesus we have two contradictory traditions: I. That he perished. Croesus off to the land of the Hyperboreans. This is confirmed, as to the voluntary nature of the act, by the Louvre amphora (No. 194, figured J. H. S. xviii. 268, where it is dated circ. 500, and in Bury, p. 228). The authority for this tradition is therefore slightly the older. II. That he was spared. We have this in three main forms: (a) That of H., supported by Ephorus (Diod. ix. 34; cf. also Nic. Dam. fr. 68 (F. H. G. iii. 407), who adds embellishments of his own). (b) Xen. Cyr. vii. 2 makes Croesus spared to be the adviser of Cyrus, but omits all marvels. (c) Ctesias (c. 4, p. 64) says nothing of the pyre, but makes Croesus saved by other marvels, and adds that Cyrus gave him the town of Barene (near Ecbatana). There is, apart from the miraculous elements, the further objection to the story that Cyrus, as a fire-worshipper, would not have polluted the sacred element (cf. iii. 16. 2). It may be argued that, not to speak of the possibility of mad freaks like those of Cambyses, Cyrus' beliefs sat lightly on him (cf. the Cylinder Inscription, R. P.2 v. 166-8, for his behaviour to the Babylonian gods, and Tac. Ann. iii. 62). But the objection, though not itself decisive, is serious. To return to the main difficulty: it is hard to believe that Croesus perished (as Maspero holds, p. 656), in defiance of the independent evidence of Ctesias and of H. The latter also tells stories of Croesus later (cc. 155, 207, iii. 14, 36) which could hardly have gained currency as to a dead man; they seem, moreover, to come from sources different from those of the Lydian history. The explanation then of Bacchylides' story may be that he gives, as Jebb shows, a Delian version of the facts. Croesus was, so to speak, canonized as a model of piety (this is implied in his being represented on a vase at all, C. R. 1898, p. 85), and so a myth had grown up around him; cf. for his religious character Pind. Pyth. i. 94, his filo/frwn a)reta/. We may then reject the evidence of Bacchylides, and assume that Croesus survived; but it is difficult to decide the further points: (1) Meyer, i1. 503, thinks his pyre was a solemn act of selfdevotion; cf. for instances of voluntary burnings vii. 107 (Boges), vii. 167 (Hamilcar), 1 Kings 16. 18 (Zimri), and the legend of Sardanapallus, the last king of Nineveh (F. H. G. ii. 505). This is the most probable view; it is supported by the oldest evidence, and consistent with Cyrus' religious beliefs. (2) N\u00f6ldeke (E. B.9 xviii. 566) accepts the pyre as the act of Cyrus, of course discarding the miracuious embellishments. (3) A less probable view is that the whole pyre story is an invention, due to the confusion of myth with history. This view makes Croesus to be confused with the sun-god, Sandon, who perishes in fire (cf. Hercules on Mount Oeta), just as his son was confused with Atys (34. 2 n.). di\\s e(pta/.

If this be H.'s meaning, it is an advance on the early idea that the gods themselves were ruled by destiny, which survives in the Prometheus of Aeschylus. But there was a growing tendency from the beginning of the fifth century to identify Fate and the will of Zeus, who is thus exalted above all subordinate deities (cf. vii. 141. 3). pe/mptou.

This chapter shows Croesus in a new light, as a cruel Oriental prince (\u00a7 4), and also gives a non-Delphian account of his oracular success (contrast c. 49). It clearly comes from another source. As it is not likely to be a later addition, it is probably a fragment of H.'s original material, which he has not worked into harmony with his narrative. The temple of Ismenian Apollo (cf. viii. 134. 1; v. 59) was just outside the city of Thebes, on the hill of St. Luke (Paus. ix. 10. 2 and Frazer, v. 40). Tripods were especially dedicated at it (Pind. Pyth. xi. 4tripo/dwn qhsauro/n). Divination at it was by inspection of fire and ashes (cf. Soph. Ant. 1005-11). Every eight years it was the scene of the Daphnephoria, familiar from Leighton's great picture. Golden 'cows' were perhaps dedicated (as a symbol of fertility) to Artemis, as representing the great 'Mother Goddess' (cf. App. I, \u00a7 2). For the Artemision Hogarth, Excavations at Ephesus, 1908, especially pp. 5-8, 245-6. The earliest shrine was probably at Ortygia, under Mount Solmissus, to the south of Ephesus; this was no doubt earlier than the Greek settlement (cf. Paus. vii. 2. 6, who rejects the statement of Pindar that it was founded by the Amazons; but parqe/noi were always associated with the cult); the earliest, near the city itself, dated from about 700; this was destroyed by the Cimmerians circ. 660 B.C. The next two temples followed rapidly, and then the famous one, which owed so much to Croesus, was begun about 550. It seems not to have been finished till about 430, and was destroyed by the arson of Herostratus in 356. Pliny (N. H. xxxvii. 98) states that the Hellenistic temple which followed had 127 columns, 'a singulis regibus factae' (obviously in contrast to ai( pollai/ (pp. 327 seq.) points out that the 'many-breasted' Artemis as a coin type seems to belong to Roman times, not to be archaic. Croesus' name can still be read on an Ephesian column-base in the B. M. (Cat. i. 29; Hicks, p. 7). Athena's temple at Delphi stood near the entrance to Apollo's; hence the epithet 'of the fore-shrine', which is confirmed by inscriptions (Ditt. i. 186). The same epithet is used of Athena and Hermes, in reference to the shrine of the Ismenian Apollo (Paus. ix. 10. 2). For A. *pronai/a at Delphi cf. viii. 37. 2 n., Aesch. Eum. 21, and Paus. x. 8. 6 (Frazer, v. 251). The epithet later was made *pro/noia with an ethical significance (Farnell, G. C. i. 306). H. had not seen the offerings at Branchidae; they no doubt perished when the temple was destroyed in 494 B. C. (cf. vi. 21 n.); the story that they were treacherously handed over to Xerxes by the people of Branchidae (Strabo, 634), who for this were massacred later by Alexander (Curtius, vii. 23; Strabo, 518), is to be rejected. On the similarity of weight and form, and on the supposed lack of Croesusinscriptions (but cf. 51. 5 n.) at Delphi, C. Niebuhr founds the wild theory that Croesus never gave gifts to Delphi at all, but that the Branchidae offerings were feloniously transferred thither, about the time of Ionic Revolt (Mitt. der Vorder-As. Gesell. 1899, pp. 27-8). The whole article is a tissue of guesses and uncritical assumptions. a)ndro/s. His name was Sadyattes; cf. Nic. Dam. fr. 65, F. H. G. iii. 397, who says that he offended Croesus when crown prince by refusing a loan; Croesus then vowed to devote his property to Artemis, if he ever became king (cf. e)/ti pro/teron \u00a7 4). Pantaleon may have been the elder, as Croesus was born in the twenty-third year of his father's reign (cf. 25. 1 and 26. 1). For the conspiracy cf. 51. 5 n.; Pantaleon perhaps had some Greek support, as being e)c *)ia/dos.

It is one of more than sixty mounds (called Bin Tepeh), of which three are conspicuously larger than the rest. Perrot et Chipiez (v. 265 seq.) make the largest rather more than 1,200 yards round, and not quite 400 in diameter; this falls a little short of H.'s measurements (\u00a7 5), viz. about 1,280 and 440 yards respectively. The base (krhpi/s) is hewn in part out of the native limestone, above which comes a wall of large blocks; H. does not notice this difference of construction. This base holds together a truncated cone of earth, of which the upper part is faced with bricks. A rectangular chamber inside contained bones of men and animals which had been burned. The sh=ma is referred to by Hipponax. ou)=roi, 'record-pillars.' These were phallic in shape, set up on the flat top; two of them have been found, one in situ; but they bear no trace of an inscription. porneu/ontai. Many see in this custom a religious significance, e. g. Ramsay, C. and B. pp. 94-5, 115; Radet compares the worship of Mylitta (c. 199 nn.), a view which is supported by Aelian, V. H. iv. 1, and Strabo, 532, who definitely compares the Lydian custom to that in the temple of inscription of the second century A. D., as to a woman of considerable position, pallakeu/sasa kai\\ kata\\ xrhsmo/n, and no doubt such religious prostitution had been more common in early times. But there is no good evidence that it was ever universal in Lydia; and the custom itself may be paralleled in countries of quite different religions, e. g. in Japan. L. Oliphant (Lord Elgin's Mission (1857-9) ii. 496 says: 'No disgrace attaches to women who have been brought up in this manner (i.e. as courtesans), and they generally make good marriages.' No doubt the custom in Lydia was mainly confined to the lower classes, who may have been of a different race (cf. App. I, \u00a7 4). For freedom of choice in marriage cf. Westermarck, c. 10. *gugai/h: now L. Colve; for the name cf. App. I, \u00a7 8. paraplhsi/oisi. For the similarity cf. App. I, \u00a7 5. The statement as to the invention of coinage is usually accepted as in the main accurate (G. F. Hill, G. and R. C. p. 7, Hist. Gk. Coins, 1-2, 18-20; Head, 83 quotes Xenophanes (fl. circ. 540) for the same statement, but he quotes also four divergent views. Bars and rings of metal of uniform weight had been used in Egypt and Babylon, but these needed frequent reweighing; coinage begins when some authority issuing coins guarantees the value by a stamp. The invention was natural for the Lydians, who, as 'the Phoenicians of the land', held the outlets of the great Eastern trade-routes. So the Aeginetans, the 'pedlars of Greece Proper', were the earliest coiners there. P. Gardner, however (B. A. P. iii. 110 seq.), thinks the earliest coins were probably of Asiatic Greek origin, perhaps struck privately by temples or bankers. The earliest Lydian coins date from the reign of Gyges; cf. *guga/das xruso/s, Poll. iii. 87, vii. 98; both passages imply that Gyges struck coins of gold of peculiar purity; but the earliest coins were really of electrum (cf. 50. 2 n.); they were oval in shape, with a type on one side and punch-mark on the other. B. V. Head (in Hogarth, E. E.) considers that eleven of the seventyeight Lydian coins found at Ephesus in the temple deposit are at latest of the time of Gyges; but he thinks they were issued privately and not by the king; the earliest royal Lydian coins were those of Alyattes, whose name perhaps can be read on some of them (H. N. 645). Croesus introduced a gold and silver coinage, stamped with the confronting heads of a lion and a bull. The Aeginetans had anticipated him in silver (Hill, G. C. p. 20 and Pl. 1); but the statements of Ephorus, that Pheidon first coined silver in Aegina (Strabo, 376) and that he invented gold and silver coinage (Strabo, 358), are probably merely embellishments of H.'s statement as to his measures (vi. 127. 3 n.). H. then may well be right as to the priority of the Lydians, but he omits the early electron coins, in view of the more famous issues of Croesus, and he is wrong in saying the Lydians were the first to coin 'silver'. For the standards cf. Hill, G. C. p. 18. ka/phloi. This statement as to 'retail trade' is, taken literally, false; such trade was familiar in Egypt and Babylon much earlier; but the Lydians were proverbially a nation of shopkeepers; cf. the proverb *ludo\\s kaphleu/ei (P. G. ii. 510). Radet, pp. 295 f., gives a brilliant picture of the wealth and vice of Sardis. For this ethnic genealogy cf. c. 7. 3 n. For Tyrsenus Xanthus (fr. 1; F. H. G. i. 36) read Torrhebus. Cf. Introd. p. 23. The same story was told of Palamedes at Troy (Soph. Fr. 380). For Greek games cf. W. Richter, Die Spiele der G. u. R. ku/boi differed from a)stra/galoi (marked on four sides only) in having pips on all six sides. Athenaeus i. 19 rightly corrects H.'s tale as to the Lydian invention of games; Nausicaa's ball play is familiar. For a similar migration to relieve over-population, and determined by lot, cf. Livy v. 34 (the Gauls); it is a usual motive in primitive history. The Umbrians are vaguely extended by H. iv. 49. 2 to the 'river Alpis', i. e. to the Alps. The story, here first given (cf. App. XV, \u00a7 6), of the Lydian origin of the Etruscans is familiar, especially from Horace (Odes, iii. 29. 1 et pass.). It was rejected with contempt in the early days of criticism (cf. Mommsen, R. H. i. 128 seq.), and the Etruscans were brought into Italy by land from the north. Modern archaeology is now accumulating evidence which confirms Greek tradition; it tends to show that native Italian civilization in the north developed without interruption from abroad, while Etruscan civilization in Central Italy was introduced by sea (like that of Carthage), and resembles that of the later Aegean periods, e.g. in its Cyclopean walls. (Cf. A. and A. pp. 304 seq. and (for a fuller statement of the evidence) App. I. 13.) Median and Persian History. This is one of the most interesting divisions of the history of H. He describes (1) the unification of Media (95-101) and its history till Cyaxares (101-6). (2) The early history of Cyrus and the fall of Media (107-30). (3) The customs of the Persians (131-40). For the sources of (1) and (2) cf. App. IV, \u00a7 4; for (3) H. uses his own observation as a visitor to Susa (cf. Intr. \u00a7 17). The important facts are given in the Appendixes on Assyria, Media, and Cyrus (II-IV), with especial reference to the narrative of H. semnou=n. For the anti-Achaemenid prejudice of H.'s source cf. J. H. S. xxvii. 40. The pres. part. a)rxo/ntwn shows that the Median kingdom arose before Nineveh fell; but H. is wrong in implying that the Medes took the lead in revolt because of their bravery; it was to their remoteness from Nineveh they owed their comparative freedom. The kws (kai/ kws ou(=toi) indicates that he knows no details. For Deioces cf. App. III, \u00a7 3. The story here is historical only in three points: (1) H. rightly conceives the Medes as previously without unity. (2) The foundation of Ecbatana was at once the symbol and the cause of union; but H.'s contrast of kata\\ kw/mas (\u00a7 2) and e(\\n po/lisma (98. 3) is Greek. (3) He gives the true Oriental colour in laying stress on the importance of Deioces as judge; but the other details, e.g. the tyrant's 'friends' (97. 2), the body-guard (98. 2), the spies (100. 2) are parts of the ordinary Greek 'Tyrant's progress'. prokati/zwn: an Oriental touch, cf. v. 12. 2 n.; justice was administered 'in the gate' (cf. Ruth iv). kathko/ntwn, present circumstances.' The word is frequent in H., cf. iv. 136. viii. 19. 2 (town), &c.'; described as carrying out a kind of sunoi/kisis. *)agba/tana is usually identified with Hamadan, 'where the passes of Mount Zagros emerge, uniting Iran to the basins of the Euphrates and Tigris' (Maspero, iii. 326); this was certainly the later Ecbatana. Sir H. Rawlinson's view that the Ecbatana of H. lay to the north-east in Media Atropatene (Rawlinson ad loc.) has not been generally adopted. The name (Pers. Hangmat\u00e1na) means 'place of gathering'. This description of the citadel is partly fact (Perrot et Chipiez v. 769). It was usual to have concentric lines of fortification; M. Dieulafoy has traced two only at Susa, but these were each very complex (ib. p. 767). H.'s 'sevenfold' defence, however, is an embellishment, due in part to a confusion with the Mesopotamian terracetemples or Ziggourats, e.g. the great temple of Nebo at Borsippa (181 n.), in part to the desire to bring in the sacred number 'seven'. The colours of the seven circles are no doubt connected with the planets (Rawlinson quotes a parallel from the Persian poet Nizami, J. R. G. S. x. 127), but the order in H. is wrong. The effect was mainly produced by glazed bricks (cf. the frescoes in the Louvre from Susa), but also by a lavish use of the precious metals (cf. Polyb. x. 27. 10 for the riches of this very town, Ecbatana). The circuit of Athens was about 60 stades (Thuc. ii. 13. 7); it is the citadel (99. 1) which is compared to this. Diodorus (xvii. 110. 7) gives that of the town of Ecbatana as 250 stades. Some have seen in this passage a proof that H. had himself been at Ecbatana; Kirchhoff argues from the comparison with Athens that the early books were written there (Introd. \u00a7 10 a); but neither of these inferences is probable. The ceremonial of an Eastern Court is, of course, far older than Deioces. Stein takes tou=to/ ge as limiting kai\\ a(/pasi to ptu/ein, i.e. none might spit in the king's presence, but those nearly connected with him might smile; it is impossible, however, to get this sense out of the words; kai/ adds emphasis to a(/pasi; cf. 133. 3 n. for the wickedness of spitting. For the position of the Magi cf. App. VIII, \u00a7 3. The Median tribes seem to have been originally local; H. uses the same word, ge/nea, of the Persian tribes (125. 3) which certainly were so (cf. for the situation of the *parhtakhnoi/ iii. 92. 1 n.). Ammianus (xxiii. 6. 32 seq.), in the fourth century A. D., gives a full account of the Magi, and speaks of them (\u00a7 35) as 'inhabiting towns without walls' in Media, where they live 'protected by religious awe'. But the local tribe had an especially religious development (cf. the tribe of Levi in Palestine), and the priesthood was confined to its members; so among the Parsees to this day only the son of a Dastur can be a Dastur (Darmstetter, S. B. E. iv. p. xlvii). Perhaps some of the tribes were non-Aryan. The conquest of Persia by the Medes is disputed, because it is inferred from the B. I. that the title 'king' was borne by the Achaemenids as far back as Teispes I (perhaps circ. 675), and Cyrus calls his three immediate ancestors 'great king' (App. IV, \u00a7 1); but this does not disprove H.'s statement, for apart from the possibility of filial flattery, in any case Persia must have been dependent on Media in the time of the next king, Cyaxares; and the reference in Ez. 38. 5 to Persia as an ally of Gog (circ. 580 B.C.) is too late and too vague to prove anything. All we can say is that H.'s statement may be true; but it quite lacks confirmation, and may be an invention of Median vanity (Pr\u00e1ek, i. 137; cf. App. IV, \u00a7 4). katestre/feto; it is important to notice the inceptive imperfect; H. knows the real founder of the Median Empire (103. 1, 2) was Cyaxares. to/te: H. antedates the break up of the Assyrian Empire; Phraortes died circ. 625 B.C., and Assurbanipal's reign (circ. 668-626) seemed to leave Assyria as strong as ever; Babylon had been humbled (648), and Elam wiped out (circ. 640). But the mistake is venial, for the strength of Assyria was exhausted (App. II, \u00a7 4). The conquests of Phraortes may have been really aided by the Assyrian victory over Elam. die/tace. H. does not mean that horse and foot were previously mixed up with each other (cf. App. III, \u00a7 4), but that Cyaxares first organized his tribal contingents as a regular army. For the eclipse battle cf. 74. 2 n. For the Cimmerian-Scythian invasions in general cf. c. 15 nn. H.'s chief mistakes here are that\u2014 (1) He confuses the original migration with the later raids. The Scyths were already in the earlier part of the seventh century settled south of the Caucasus round Lake Urmiah. It is probable, however, there were new bands of invaders from the north-east (cf. 104 nn.). (2) It is probable the Scythian attack on the Medes was not accidental (v. i.). (3) He makes too definite the 'rule of the Scyths'; as he himself says, the '28 years' (106. 1; iv. 1. 3) included the whole time of their wanderings. For these later Scythian raids cf. Zeph. i (circ. 630-620 B. C.); Jer. i. 13-14, 'I see a seething pot and its face is towards the north'; and Maspero, iii. 472 seq. Rawlinson (i. 399) quite underestimates their importance. Protothyes is probably the Bartatua of the monuments, to whom Esarhaddon gave his daughter in marriage. If the Assyrians really called in the northern barbarians as allies, they paid in the end dearly for the temporary relief, while the Medes suffered little, as they were protected by their mountains; it was like the inviting of Germans by the Sequani (Caes. B. G. i. 31). The name of Madyes, too, is confirmed by the monuments; Strabo (61) couples him with Sesostris and others as a leader of oi( e)pi\\ polu\\ e)ktopismoi/. trih/konta. The distance (about 300 miles) is a little more than that across Asia Minor (about 250 miles), to which H. assigns only five days (72. 3 n.), while here he allows thirty days, a far more probable estimate. H.'s distances are not actual measurements, but are only estimates based on the usual time taken for the journeys. Here, on the Black Sea coast, a great detour would be necessary. For the Saspeires north-west of Media and south of the modern Georgia, cf. iii. 94 n. H.'s words here and in iv. 37 seem to point to the fact that one of the great roads of the Persian Empire ran from Ecbatana, past Lake Urmiah, into the upper valley of the Araxes, where the Saspeires lived, and thence over the mountains, to the Phasis valley and the Black Sea. *kauka/sion o)/ros. There are only two roads across the Caucasus: (1) The 'Caucasian Gates', nearly in the centre, where the modern road past Vladikavkas runs. (2) The road on the west of the Caspian, past Derbend, where the railway runs; probably H. means this second road. Stein, however, thinks neither of these can be called 'much longer', and so brings the Scyths east of the Caspian. This was probably the actual route of part of the invaders, but H. clearly did not know it. For *palaisti/nh| *suri/h| cf. iii. 5. 1 n. For ou)rani/h *)a. cf. c. 131 n; at Ascalon she was called Derceto, and her image was half woman, half fish. punqano/menos. For H.'s question cf. ii. 44. 1, where he says that he had travelled to Tyre to ask a similar question. For the temple at Paphos cf. J. H. S. ix. 193 seq., and for that of Cythera, Paus. iii. 23. 1; the statue in the latter was a co/anon w(plisme/non (Frazer, iii. 338) which recalls the martial side of the goddess Ishtar. The temple was the oldest in Greece to the goddess. For the Phoenicians in Greece cf. iv. 147 n. qh/lean nou=son. The disease, described by Hippocrates (peri\\ a)e/rwn 22), is said by Ar. (Ethics vii. 7. 6) to be hereditary in the Scythian royal families. Littr\u00e9 (Hippoc. ii, p. xl seq.) is inclined to follow der i. (1839), that the qh/lea nou=sos is paiderasti/a; this is the usual meaning of the words among the ancients, and the vice was thought hereditary. He admits, however, that this explanation does not correspond to the description of the disease in Hippocrates, and it is not a natural explanation of H. here. In iv, p. x, moreover, Littr\u00e9 quotes some curious cases of impotence described by the great French surgeon, Larrey, in the army of Syria (1799 A. D.), which seem to fit the words of H. much better than Rosenbaum's explanation. a(/ma te ought properly to follow the le/gousi oi( *s. For the e)na/rees cf. iv. 67. 2. The 'twenty-eight years' are a piece of unexplained tradition; the old explanation that they are the interval between Cyaxares' accession and the fall of Nineveh breaks down, because we now know Cyaxares came to the throne in 625 not in 634 B.

B.9 xviii. 563, s. v. Persia), who quotes parallels from Oriental history; there is nothing unlikely in it. The capture of Nineveh took place c. 606.

H. is wrong in making Cyrus the grandson of Astyages, and Ctesias equally wrong in saying (c. 2, p. 64) that he married Astyages' daughter, Amytis.

The dog was a sacred animal among the Iranians (140. 3 n.), and no doubt in the original legend the hero is suckled by a bitch as was Sargon of Accad; Justin (i. 4) gives both stories, the femina', and the nurse 'cui Spaco postea nomen fuit'. For the rescue by the sacred animal cf. App. IV, \u00a7 5. For the rationalization (122. 3) cf. Livy, i. 4. 7 (the she-wolf (lupa) becomes Acca Laurentia, a lupa by profession). This version of the story is Greek, but whether H. or his informants be responsible for it, it is impossible to say. For *spakw/, which H. seems to be right in calling 'Median', cf. L. & S. s. v. ku/wn. H. means the north part of Media, Atropatene, which is mountainous and wooded; but the statement that the rest is flat (a)/pedos), even by comparison, is an exaggeration. Hecataeus (fr. 172; F. H. others Pr\u00e1ek (Klio, iv. 205) bases his theory that H. borrowed this part of his story from Hecataeus, but the borrowing is probably the other way; cf.

For a parallel to this idea that the murderer in intention is a murderer in reality cf. Soph. O. T. 534. Xenophon (Cyr. i. 2. 5) makes the Persian tribes twelve, a number to which he is partial in the Cyropaedia; but the authority of H. is preferable. Meyer (iii. 10) lays stress on the 'fundamental importance' of H.'s account here. Spiegel (Eran. Alt. ii. 238) says, 'The inscriptions as well as the Avesta show us that H. was right as to the tribal divisions of the Iranians.' It is interesting to contrast H.'s contemporary list with the artificial one in Strabo (727), in which the Achaemenidae and the Magi are inserted. The distinction of rank and privilege (cf. iii. 93. 2 n.; the Sagartians pay tribute) among tribes has parallels in H. (iv. 20. 1, the Royal Scyths as opposed to the 'Husbandmen' and the 'Nomads'), and elsewhere (cf. the 'Golden Horde' among the Tartans). Stein suggests that \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4 are a later addition by H. The Pasargadae (cf. iv. 167. 1) gave their name to the capital under Cyrus and Cambyses. It is identified with Murgh\u00e2b, in the mountains to the north-east of Persepolis. That city was founded by Darius, as Pasargadae was too out-of-the-way for a capital. The name, 'Persepolis,' however, does not occur till Macedonian times. For the identification of Pasargadae and Murgh\u00e2b cf. Perrot et Chipiez, v. 443-5. The view of Oppert, that Pasargadae is to be placed south-east of Shiraz, is impossible, as it removes the site too far from Persepolis. At Murgh\u00e2b is a building known as 'the tomb of the Mother of Solomon', which is usually identified with the tomb of Cyrus (for a defence of this traditional view cf. Curzon, Persia, ii. 74 seq.; for the tomb itself, P. et C. v. 597-607, with picture). The tomb is in seven tiers, with a chamber on the top, and answers to the description of Cyrus' tomb in Arrian (Anab. vi. 29. 4-8). On one of the pillars of the palace at Murgh\u00e2b is a figure which once bore an inscription, 'I am Cyrus the king, the Achaemenian.' Difficulties have been raised as to this figure, because the head-dress is Egyptian, and the four wings and the fringed garment are usually called Assyrian (cf. 135. In. for Persian borrowing). But E. Herzfeld (Klio, viii. 63-4) says the dress is Elamite, and so suitable to Cyrus; and Curzon (u. s.) ingeniously shows that the description of Arrian implies that the body of Cyrus was buried in Egyptian fashion, i. e. like a mummy; he refers doubtfully to iii. 2, the story of Nitetis, as explaining how this could be. The identification, therefore, of the figure with that of the great Cyrus may be accepted. *mara/fioi. We have a Maraphian in command against Cyrene iv. 167. 1. The Achaemenidae were a 'clan' (frh/trh) of the royal tribe. The nomad 'Sagartians' are Persian 'in speech' vii. 85. 1 and partly in dress, and yet, as (iii. 93. 2) part of the fourteenth satrapy, they paid tribute. It may be suggested that the nomad Persian tribes took no part in the national rising under Cyrus, and hence forfeited their privileges. The name of the *germa/nioi (cf. for the change *)agba/tana and *)ekba/tana) seems to be found in Carmania (hod. Kerman), the district to the east of Persia, where H. (iii. 93. 2) places the *ou)/tioi, who also form part of the fourteenth satrapy. The Mardi (Strabo, 508 *)/amardoi) the cragsman Hyroeades (84. 2) was a Mardian. The other tribes are only doubtfully identified; some connect the Dai with the Dadicae (iii. 91. 4), and the Dropici with the Derbicae (Strabo, 514), but these tribes are much too remote. Aesch. Pers. 774 seq. inserts *ma/rdos and *ma/rafis in his list of Persian kings. H. is only repeating what he has heard; but he is right in laying stress on the nomadic tribes; large parts of modern Persia are desert, or habitable only at certain seasons (for its shape cf. R\u00e9clus, Geog. Univ. ix. 144), and the Ily\u00e2ts or nomads are a considerable part of the population. The promises of Cyrus (e.g. \u00a7 5) have been thought by micro scopic critics to be inconsistent with the account of Persian simplicity in c. 71, but each is true in its place. The account of H., that the victory of Cyrus was rendered easy by treachery, is far more like the real facts as told in the Annalistic Tablet (cf. App. IV, \u00a7 1) than the long and picturesque version of Nicolas Damascenus (fr. 66; F. H. G. iii. 405-6, probably from Ctesias); cf. App. IV, \u00a7 4. qeoblabh/s. H., as is only that of contrast; the Medes to some extent shared the Persian rule (App. VI, \u00a7 3). pare\\c h)\\ ktl. For the chronology of this passage cf. App. III, \u00a7 6. H.'s usage, as well as the general sense, seems to require that the 128 years should be inclusive of 'the Scythian rule'; he puts a deduction, which has still to be made, after the words limited (cf. vi. 5. 3), a deduction already made, before them (ii. 77. 5); but he is not quite consistent. The Median revolt here referred to was long supposed to be that against Darius Nothus in 408 B.C. (Mure, 1859, iv. 540-2, argues ingeniously for this), and so to prove that H. lived on till nearly 400 B.C. But it is now generally thought that the revolt is that of 520 B.C. (cf. B. I. col. 2), for the following reasons: (1) Darius in H. always means D. Hystaspes (except in ix. 108. 2, where it is the name of a son of Xerxes). (2) There is some point in Median 'repentance' after 30 years; after nearly 150 their repentance is impossibly tardy. (3) It is usually thought that H. was dead before 420 B.C. (Intr. \u00a7 9). pa/shs th=s *)asi/hs. H. resumes his connexion before going on to his excursus on the Persians. He means that the victory over Croesus was the beginning of a career of conquest which made Cyrus 'lord of all Asia'; but he writes very loosely, for Babylon and Bactria were subdued later, and it is not certain that Cyrus ever conquered Phoenicia at all (cf. iii. 19. 3 n.). The manners and institutions of the Persians. This section is one of the most valuable in H.; for a summing up as to his account of the Persian religion cf. App. VIII. [The Zendavesta is quoted from Sacred Books of the East, vols. IV (part I), XXIII, XXXI; the references are to pages in the introductions unless otherwise stated]. a)ga/lmata ktl. This passage is accurate in the general sense; there were no cult-statues in Persia (but v. i.), and the Persians worshipped in the open air; Dinon, a fourth-century writer (fr. 9, F. H. G. on the hill-tops (cf. Maspero, iii. 591, for picture of those at Nakhsh-I-Roustem), and there were others in temples (cf. further in App. VIII, \u00a7 4), on which the everburning fire was maintained. H. here gives the strict theory of the religion, but there were inconsistencies in practice. For a similar belief and a similar inconsistency in Germany cf. Tac. Germ. c. 9 contrasted with cc. 7, 40; we might add that there is a similar reasonable inconsistency in Christianity. H. is on the whole confirmed by the usage of the Parsees, among whom the word for fire-temple (D\u00e2dg\u00e2h) seems to mean also the place for any object (e.g. for the dead or the dog). Spiegel, Avesta, vol. ii, p. lxiv (1859). a)nqrwpofue/as. Ormazd (cf. figs. in Maspero, iii. 577, 681) is represented e.g. on B. I. as a form, human to the waist, proceeding from the winged disk, the symbol of eternity and omnipresence; this was borrowed from Assyria (cf. 135. 1), which perhaps had in turn borrowed it from the winged sun-orb of Egypt. *dii/. H. naturally speaks of the supreme as 'Zeus'; he is quite right as to the worship on the mountain-tops (v. s.), but writes loosely in identifying him with the sky; 'Ormazd clothes upon himself the firm stones of the heavens (as his robe)' (Yasna, 30. 5; xxxi. 31); 'the sun and are his eyes' (ib. 68. 22, p. 324); but the strict creed had spiritualized him, and distinguished him from his attributes, cf. Yast 13. 1, 2; xxiii. 180; Ahuramazda speaks, 'I maintain that sky, there above, shining and seen afar, and encompassing this earth all round.' But 'many features, though ever dimmer and dimmer, betray his former bodily, or rather sky, nature' (iv. 58). For invocations addressed to the sun and the moon, along with the waters, cf. Vend\u00eed\u00e2d, Farg. 21, iv. 231-4. H. is quite right in laying stress on the sacredness of the four elements. th=| *ou)rani/h|. This passage is important in three ways: (1) It illustrates Persian borrowing from foreigners (135. 1); they had mixed with their dualistic creed many alien elements. The worship of the Oriental love-goddess Anaitis was combined with the old Iranian S\u00fbra by Artaxerxes Longimanus (465-425) (Berosus, fr. calls him tou= *darei/ou tou= *)/wxou, but this must be a mistake). The king set up her statues for worship in Ecbatana and Susa, though previously worship of Anaitis, which was especially established in Armenia, cf. Strabo, 532. For the quaint story of her worship in Skye cf. Boswell's Johnson, v. 218 (B. Hill's edition). For Yast 5; xxiii. 52 seq. (2) H. makes a strange mistake in confusing this worship with that of Mithra, the god of heavenly light, 'who foremost in golden array takes hold of the beautiful summits' (Yast 10. 4; xxiii. 123). Mithra, at first only closely connected with the sun, was later identified with him (cf. the frequent inscription 'Deo invicto Soli Mithrae'). His worship became most important in the later developments of the Persian religion; Artaxerxes II is the first to invoke him and Anaitis, along with Orrnazd. His feast was a solemn festival, at which the Persian king was expected to get drunk (Duris, fr. 13, F. H. G. ii. 473). For Mithraism in Roman times, when it was a formidable rival to Christianity, cf. Dill, Roman Society from Nero, pp. 585 seq.; it was the special religion of the legions (cf. R. Kipling's fine poem in Puck of Pook's Hill). H. seems to have been misled by the likeness of the names 'Mylitta' and 'Mithra', and perhaps by the fact that they were both heavenly divinities (v. i. for Mylitta). (3) The passage shows the close connexion of Aphrodite with the Babylonian Mylitta, the Assyrian Ishtar, the Phoenician Astarte; whether there was actual borrowing, or whether independent cults were assimilated, it is impossible to say; probably both were the case (v. i.). Ishtar was the queen of the gods, at once warrior goddess and goddess of generation, the destroyer of life and its renewer. From Assyria her worship spread to Phoenicia (cf. 105. 2 n. for her temple at Ashkelon), and thence to Cyprus (for her temple at Paphos cf. Tac. Hist. ii. 2-3; 105. 3 n.). Her shrine at Cythera was founded by Phoenicians (105. 2 n.), and was the oldest in Greece (cf. her epithet *kuqe/reia in Od. viii. 288). For the rites at her temple in Babylon cf. c. 199 n.; for impure ritual in Greece (at Corinth only) Strabo, 378, and Athen. 573. She was identified at once with the evening star, 'the star of love,' and with the moon (cf. Milton, P. L. i. 439, 'Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns'); this later identification was probably due to a confusion with Isis and Hathor, who are represented as supporting on their horned heads the solar disk; these symbols were mistakenly interpreted as the crescent and the full moon. That the Greeks were conscious of the partially foreign origin of Aphrodite is shown by her epithets *ku/pris (Il. v. 330), *kuprogenh/s (Hesiod), &c.; for these cf. Od. viii. 362. There may have been an original native goddess in Greece who was identified with the Oriental goddess; so at Mycenae are found naked female figures with hands on breasts, and in some cases with a dove (cf. Schuchhardt's Schliemann, figs. 180-2), which may well be independent of direct Oriental influence. The Greeks took over from the East her title of *ou)rani/a without understanding it: hence they attempted to distinguish Aphrodite O., the goddess of pure love, from A. pa/ndhmos (Paus. ix. 16. 4; cf. Xen. Symp. 8. 9-10 for the supposed contrast in their worships); but this is a later and artificial explanation. (For the evidence cf. Driver, Hastings' Dict., s. v. Ashtoreth, and more fully Farnell, C. G. S. ii. 618 seq.) The name Mylitta is probably the 'bilit' or 'belit' of the Assyrian inscriptions = 'lady', i. e. the feminine of Baal or Bel = 'lord'. Aliat (cf. iii. 8. 3) = Al Il\u00e2t, 'the goddess.' What was originally a common noun became a proper name; so 'Astarte', properly an epithet signifying fruitfulness (Deut. vii. 13), became the name of a goddess. qusi/h. For the resemblances of the 'manner of sacrifice to the rites of the Ali Allahis in modern Persia' cf. Rawlinson, ad loc.; the open air sacrifice, the 'myrtle', the 'hymn' (e)paoidh/n), the 'boiling of the flesh', and its distribution to the worshippers all occur in the modern rite. There can be no doubt that H. had watched a Persian sacrifice. Strabo (733) gives a fuller description, based partly on H., and partly on what he had seen in Armenia. H.'s object throughout is to contrast Persian and Greek customs; this will explain his verbal inaccuracies. The victim is not burned as in Greece, but H. writes loosely (cf. 131. 1 n.) in saying 'no fire is kindled'; there was fire in the Persian sacrifices, but it was fed with wood; there were no 'libations' of wine; but the sacred water ('zasthra', S. B. E. iv, p. 69) was sometimes poured (cf. vii. 54. 2 (Xerxes at the Hellespont), 188. 2 n.); the fillet (e)stefanwme/nos) was not a Greek ste/mma, which was always intertwined with woollen threads. ou)lh=|si. For the sacred 'barley' and its pro/xusis cf. 160. 5, and Gardner and Jevons, G. A. p. 250. The meal offering of barley went with the burnt offering, as bread goes with meats in a meal (cf. Lev. ix. 17 R. V.). Another contrast is that the Greeks sacrificed bareheaded but for a garland, the Persian wore his 'tiara'. kaqaro/n. The idea is double, partly a place free from pollution, partly one where there is no obstacle to sacrifice; cf. vii. 183. 2 to\\ e)mpodw\\n w)=n marks the apodosis. For the Magians 101 n. and App. VIII, \u00a7 3. oi(/hn dh/. Translate 'for such they say the invocation is'; H. does not profess himself to have understood the incantation. Darmstetter (iv. 53) says, 'H. may have heard the Magi sing the very same Gathas which are now sung by the Mobeds in Bombay.' The hymns invoke Ormazd and his ministering spirits and dwell upon their attributes; they are not a 'Theogony' in the Hesiodic sense (ii. 53. 2 n.). o( qu/sas. Greek usage left a portion for the priests. Strabo (732) says the Persian god's share was the life (yuxh/) of the victim. lo/gos ai(re/ei. More often without an object (cf. vi. 124. 3); 'as reason takes him,' i. e. as ktl. Aristophanes (Ach. 85-7) parodies this passage; cf. 3. 2 n. Cf. ix. 110. 2 for the royal birthday. ta\\ lepta/: i. e. sheep and goats; pro/baton includes, especially in Ionic Greek, all beasts of the herd that 'go before' the shepherd. The Greeks, like the moderns, had their 'dessert dishes' (e)pi-forh/mata) served up after the solid food (si=ta, cf. a)po\\ dei/pnou); the Persians had them, not 'as one course' (a(le/di), but at intervals during the meal. H. Rawlinson (ad loc.) compares the fondness of the modern Persians for sweetmeats (but these are now served before the meal). Anything that left the body became separated from life and so unclean. For the strange rules of the Avesta on these subjects cf. Fargard, xvii, as to paring the nails; ib. xviii. 40-9, as to the urine (iv. 185, 197). The first part of this custom is ascribed by Tacitus (Germ. 22) to the Germans; he gives the reason 'Deliberant dum fingere in, truth out'). Lack of humour in historians has erected into a system what was merely due to excess. For Persian drinking cf. Curzon, ii. 506, (The Persian) 'is not a tippler but a toper, not a drinker, but a drunkard', quoting other authorities for the same view. H. Rawlinson compares the devotion to etiquette among the modern Persians, 'the Frenchmen of the East'; the salute, however, now is never on the lips. The prostration of an inferior is familiar in the East (iii. 86. 2); it was as repulsive to the Greeks as the Chinese 'kotow' to Doyle's 'Private of the Buffs'. Cf. vii. 136. 1, and the refusal of Callisthenes to prostrate himself before Alexander (Arr. Anab. iv. 10. 5 seq.). a)ri/stous. The Persian Shah, till he was deposed, was called 'the centre of the Universe'. H., however, makes too systematic the conceit common to all nations, civilized as well as uncivilized. Two points must be distinguished: (1) The Persian system of graduated respect. (2) The Median system of graduated rule, which H. compares to it (\u00a7 3 ad fin. 'in the same way as the Persian show degrees of honour'). As to (2) H. is again too systematic, but he represents accurately the broad facts of the contrast between Persian and Median rule; under the Medes, the subject kingdoms paid tribute or sent gifts, while they still ruled their own dependents; under Persia, all districts alike were under the satraps, and in direct relation to the great king (iii. 87 seq.). The sentence is carefully balanced; kai\\ tw=n e)/qnos to the Persians; but this is incorrect in fact and spoils the antithesis. (2) Stein takes it of the Medes; translate 'The race went forward thus ever from government by themselves (a)/rxon) to government through others' (e)pitropeu=on); but it is hard to get this sense out of e)pitropeu=on, which = 'administering' (iii. 36. 3) or 'being regent for' (655); the sense would e. 'deputing' (th\\n a)rxh/n), and the ellipse would be harsh. (3) It is simplest therefore to make to\\ e)/qnos distributive, 'each nation took its place in order as ruler and administrator.' This sentence then simply repeats generally what H. has already said more definitely above; it may be a gloss, and Kr\u00fcger brackets it. Hellanicus (fr. 169; F. H. G. i. 68) says the Persians learned the practice of castration from the Babylonians; cf. H. iii. 92. 1. e)sqh=ta. H. describes the 'Median' armament (skeuh/) of the Persian 'Immortals' in vii. 61 (v. n.); the real Persian dress was of leather (skuti/nh), and its main feature the trousers (71. 2); such a dress, fitting closely, is worn by the common soldiers on the monuments, while the king and his attendants have a long flowing dress. (Rawlinson, ad loc., gives pictures.) Cf. Strabo, 525, for the borrowing. Curzon, ii. 633, speaks of '(Persian) imitativeness long notorious in the East'. He also agrees with c. 134 as to Persian conceit (p. 628). paisi/: the vice was older and is denounced in the Vendidad (Farg. 8. 5; iv. 102); Greek influence may have helped to spread it. pollou\\s pai=das. Cf. Vend. Farg. 4. 47; iv. 46, 'He who has children is far above the childless man.' Large families were both commended for religious motives (Ormazd is the Lord of Life), and politically were all-important to a small ruling caste. i(ppeu/ein. Xenophon (Cyr. i. 3. 3) says that Cyrus made the Persians a nation of horsemen; this is thought by some (e.g. Meyer, iii. 9) to be a pure invention; it is argued that Xenophon, as a cavalry officer, wished his countrymen to develop that arm of their forces; hence Cyrus' supposed development is merely an object-lesson to the Greeks. But as the Persians were largely a race of mountaineers, cavalry can hardly have played much part among them till Cyrus began a career of conquest. Hence Xenophon may be right on this point. a)lhqi/zesqai. The importance of 'Truth' is brought out in the B. I. i. 10, 'The lie became abounding in the land'; iv. 13, (Ormazd helps Darius) 'because I was not wicked nor was I a liar' (cf. also col. iv. 4, 5, 6, 8). The liar is a 'Mithra-drug'; he offends against the allseeing sun-god, who is the guardian of contracts (cf. 138. 1). For a transgression of the rule as to Truth cf. iii. 72 n. H. is right in crediting the Persians with the virtues of chivalry. mhde/na is both subject and object; this double use of a word is frequent in H. (e.g. viii. 142. 3). For compensation in mitigation of punishment cf. Sandoces, vii. 194. 2. The principle was extended to religion; in modern Parseeism every offence and every good deed has a price, and so a balance is struck (S. B. E. iv. 99 n.). Aristotle (Hist. Anim. iii. 11, p. 518) describes the leu/kh, which seems to have been a mild form of leprosy. Leper isolation was general in the East; cf. Lev. xiii. 46 for the Jews, who (like the Persians) looked upon the disease as the symbol and the result of moral evil. The Vendidad is a Persian Leviticus, and is mainly comprised of laws of purification (cf. Farg. 5. 21; iv. 55); 'Purity is for man, next to life, the greatest good.' Savage analogies are numerous; cf. Tylor, Prim. Cult. ii4. 429 for 'Lustration'. Charon (fr. 3, F. H. G. i. 32) spoke of 'white doves' in connexion with Mardonius' expedition in 493 B.C. (described in vi. 44-5) (cf. Introd. \u00a7 19); perhaps these doves belonged to the Phoenician sailors. H. here seems to connect them with leprosy. e)s potamo/n. The prohibition is due to respect to the element, water (cf. c. 140 for respect to the earth, and vii. 113. 2 for worship of rivers). So in later developments of the religion, the Magi are said to have deposed a king for building bath-houses; bathing smacked of heresy (S. B. E. iv. 90 n.). H. is at his weakest as a linguist (cf. explanation of royal names, vi. 98. 3 n.); yet he seems to have valued himself on this score. He makes two remarks on Persian names, which are both inaccurate: (1) That they all have a certain meaning. sw=ma is variously taken (a) by Stein, in a general sense, 'individuals (32. 8) and their honourable nature'; (b) by Macaulay, 'their bodily shape' (which is simpler). Whichever sense be given, H. is too absolute; nor is he consistent; cf. vi. 98. Some Persian names referred to deities (cf. Mithradates, 'given by Mithra'); others to personal appearance (Otanes, body'); others (e.g. Darius, 'possessor' to position, &c. (2) That all names end in S. This, in the first place, ignores all feminine names. Even of men's names, it is only true of the Greek forms; in Persian, s (sh) was retained after i or u, e.g. Darayavaush = Darius, but not otherwise, e.g. Vist\u00e2\u00e7ha (Hystaspes), where, however, the final a was not written. For the interesting statement as to the Greek alphabet cf. Roberts, Gk. Epig. p. 8 seq. The Phoenicians had four signs for sibilants, each of which was borrowed in part by Greece: (1) The hard Samech (No. 15 in the Phoenician alphabet; sign <*>), 'Sigma'. Others, however, make ('the hissing letter') a genuine word lingual Tsade (No. 18; sign <*>). (3) The palatal Shin (No. 21; sign <*>). (4) There was also the soft Zazin (No. 7; sign <*>). Of these the name Tsade survives in Zeta, while 'Samech' was transferred to the place of 'Shin'. The sign of Samech and its place in the alphabet after 'N', were left to the later Xi. For 'San' cf. Pind. fr. 79. H. probably means by 'San' the M of the old Dorian inscriptions, while his 'Sigma' is the <*> of the older Ionic ones. The dead body had passed under the control of the evil spirit Ahriman; hence it had to be kept from the elements fire, water, earth. This custom of burial still prevails among the Parsees. For the precepts of the strict Mazdean creed cf. Vend. Farg. 6. 44 seq. (iv. 73); the corpse was fastened down to prevent polluting fragments being carried away. Heraclitus, who seems to have been acquainted with Mazdeism, left his dead body to be torn by dogs. Meyer, who quotes other instances (i. 12), thinks that Zoroaster has simply embodied in his creed the original usage as to the dead among the primitive Iranians (ib. 579). Cf. S. B. E. iv. 91 for a description of the Parsee 'Dakhmas', first called 'Towers of Silence' by an Irish journalist in Bombay (cf. letter in Times, Aug. 8, 1905). H. is quite right, however, in saying that these rules of burial were not observed by the ordinary Persian. de\\ w)=n, 'at any rate'; this concession was made by the Persians to the strictness of their creed; for 'covering with wax' cf. iv. 71. 1. The dog was sacred to Ormazd (cf. its part in the Cyrus legend c. 107 n.); there are rules for the care of bitches in pup in Farg. 15, iv. 176 seq. On the other hand, it was a meritorious act to kill the creatures of Ahriman (ib. 166). Other creatures also were sacred to Ormazd, the 'water dog' (otter), and the 'prickly dog' (hedgehog), because it killed so many of the creeping things of Ahriman. The Persian conquest of the Asiatic Greeks. This continues the general narrative from c. 94. toi=si au)toi=si. The Ionians had paid tribute to the Lydians (27. 1), and had had their walls dismantled (v. i.tei/xea p.); this is more probable than Stein's view that previously the citadels only had been fortified; the fact that a citadel could still resist when a town was taken (c. 15 bis) does not prove the town itself was unfortified (cf. 163. 4 n.). The Ionians now have to serve in war also (171. 1). au)lhth/n. The fable is part of a collection bearing Aesop's name. For it cf. St. Matt. xi. 17. For Cyrus' invitation to rebel cf. 76. 3. The long resistance of Miletus to Alyattes (c. 17 seq.) must have been known to Cyrus, who therefore allowed it favourable terms. Perhaps it obtained trade privileges; the southern route, down the Maeander and past Miletus, would be more used, if Sardis on the Hermus, and Phocaea, just north of the Hermus mouth, had suffered. 'Ionians' was the general name of the Greeks in the East (for the whole question of the Ionians cf. especially Busolt, i. 277 seq., and Meyer, F. i. 127 seq.); cf. Persian 'Yauna' in the B. I., and 'Javan' Gen. x. 2; also vii. 178*)iao/nwn gh=n oi)/xetai pe/rsai qe/lwn. It was this that first came in contact with Orientals. So 'Frank' was used in the East of all Crusaders. As to the origin of the name 'Ionian', two views are held: (1) That it developed in Asia Minor, and was gradually extended to the islands and Attica. 'The central part of the Aegean formed in language, commerce, and civilization a closely connected whole, whose unity found its clearest expression in the great fair at Delos' (Meyer, u. s. 133), though its original home was the Asiatic mainland. (2) That it was brought to Asia from Europe by the most important tribe among the immigrants, which was connected with part of the population of Attica. This latter in the main is H.'s view (c. 147), and may be accepted for the following reasons (see Note F, p. 450): a) The four Ionian tribes are found in Attica (v. 66. 2 n.), and are proved by inscriptions to have existed in Delos and in Teos; as we have inscriptions also as to them in Cyzicus and in Perinthus, we may infer their existence in Miletus and in Samos (Busolt, i. 279). b) The festival of the Apaturia is found in Athens and in the Ionic cities of Asia Minor (not in the Orientalized Ephesus and Colophon (147. 2)). But the Athenian cult of Apollo patrw=|os (in spite of Plato, Euthyd. 302 C) is not found in Ionia (Farnell, G. C. iv. 161). c) Attica is Ionic very early. Cf. Il. xiii. 685, (*)aq. *pol. 5) calls it presbuta/thn gai=an *)iaoni/as. It was as head of the Ionians that Athens took part in the Amphictyonic Council. At the same time it is possible that there was a survival of preIonic population in Attica. Ion in the legend comes from abroad (cf. viii. 44. 2), from the later Achaia, originally called Aegialus (Paus. vii. 1. 1; H. vii. 94); Euripides (in the Ion) gives him a native mother, Creusa. For the strife of races in Attic myth cf. 78. 3 n. The peculiar feature in Attica, however, is that the two races amalgamated before history begins. As to the first view, viz. that 'Ionian' rose in Asia Minor, three theories may be briefly mentioned: (1) Curtius' famous paradox (Die Ionier vor der Ion. Wanderung, 1855) was that the Ionians came into Greece from Asia Minor. This is accepted by Holm (i. c. 7), but it contradicts all tradition; and the fact that the Ionians always were confined to the coast points clearly to their having reached it by sea. (2) Meyer maintained (u. s. p. 150) that the settlement of Ionia took place in Mycenaean times. But the almost complete absence in Ionia of the 'stirrup vases' and of the gems, so characteristic of Mycenaean civilization, is against this (Busolt, i. 277 n.). (3) Bury (E. H. R. 1900, p. 288 seq.) thinks the name 'Ionian' was borrowed by immigrants from a pre-Greek population in Asia Minor; cf. the possible identification of the 'Yaunna', allies of the Hittites against Rameses II in the thirteenth century B.C. (App. x. 8), with 'Ionians'. But there is no sufficient evidence for this view. kalli/stw|. Cf. the view in Arist. Pol. vii. 7. 2-3, 1327 b that the Greek race owed to equable climate the fact that it was at once e)/nqumon and dianohtiko/n, a mean between the reckless Northerners and the cowardly Easterns. Hippocrates (de Aer. 12) claims for Asia panto\\s i)somoiri/h in natural advantages. The krh=sis tw=n w)re/wn gives metrio/ths; but he goes on to admit that courage and endurance cannot be expected in a region so favoured. tro/pous te/sseras. H. is probably more trustworthy in his linguistic remarks here than as to non-Greek tongues; but there are too few early inscriptions for us to be able to refute or to confirm him. Miletus, with Myus and Priene, lay on or near the Latmian bay. ou)de/n. Stein thinks H. is exaggerating here, and is preparing the way for his attack on the purity of Ionic blood (cc. 146-7). But the words only mean that the dialectic peculiarities of each group were different; that all spoke Ionic is assumed. Erythrae lies opposite Chios. The antithesis to kat' a)/llo me/n is never directly given; but is implied in \u00a7 3, i.e. 'these twelve cities formed the Pan-Ionium'. H., in explaining the reason for this separate policy, loses his construction. a)sqene/staton. H. is accused of anti-Ionian bias (cf. v. 69. 1; vi. 13. 1 n.), as a Dorian and as an admirer of Periclean Athens. But he especially limits his statement here to the second half of the sixth century (to/te), of which it is true, if we except Samos; the greatness of Miletus in trade and in politics was already largely a thing of the past. Meyer (F. i. 129 seq.) denies that in the fifth century there was any inferiority attached to the name 'Ionian'; he says (p. 131) that H. is simply trying to explain why the Athenians, who are the representatives of the Ionian race (cf. Solon in *)aq. *pol. quoted on c. 142), are never called so as a people. It is clear, however, that there was some contempt in 'Ionians' in the fifth century [cf. iv. 142; Thuc. v. 9. 1 (Brasidas), vi. 77. 1 (Hermocrates), viii. 25. 5, with Hauvette, R. E. G. 1888, 257 seq.], no doubt because, as Hermocrates says, they had been subject to barbarians, and because of their increasing Oriental admixture; so the Ionian dress is imposed on the Athenian ladies as a punishment (v. 87. 3). The name too was being specialized for the inhabitants of the Lydian and north Carian seaboard [cf. the 'Ionian' circle in the Athenian Empire, and the inscription as to Tanagra (Paus. v. 10. 4), which distinguishes Athenians from Ionians. Athens was playing a double and inconsistent part; on the one hand she was championing Ionism (ix. 106. 3; Thuc. iii. 86. 3-4, vi. on the other she was enslaving her Ionian kinsmen; but it must be remembered that the Ionic Apaturia was always celebrated at Athens (c. 147. 2 n.), and that the Athenians retained the 'Ionic' tribes, at least for religious purposes. prosoi/kwn. Among these may be mentioned Carpathos, Syme (174. 3), Calydna, and Nisyros (vii. 99. 2). Melos, Thera, and Phaselis (ii. 178. 2 n.) were too remote to join in the festival. The Triopian peninsula (cf. 174. 3) lay just north of Cnidus (Thuc. viii. 35. 2); its temple was the centre of the Dorian Amphictyony. dia\\ tau/thn th\\n ai)ti/hn. H. no doubt tells the Halicarnassian story. At best it was an occasion, not the cause of exclusion, which was no doubt due to the Carian and Ionian admixture at Halicarnassus. (Cf. Hicks, p. 41, and Introd. p. 2.) That town was the furthest point to the north of Dorian colonization, which crossed the Aegean by way of Crete, probably in the tenth century, and spread up the coast till it met the tide of Ionic migration. Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus were the three cities in Rhodes, synoecized about 408 B.C. Here as elsewhere (cf. 56. 3 n.) H. accepts the usual tradition of the Dorian migration and its results. That the colonization of Ionia was connected with that early 'wandering of the nations' is probable; that it took place all at once, as H. implies, is most unlikely. Whether any great mass of the colonists came from the north of Peloponnese, as is stated here and also by Strabo (383, though with variations), is very uncertain. The arguments for this last point are (1) the common number, twelve states; (2) the supposed connexion of Poseidon of Helice (Il. viii. 203) with P. Heliconius (but see 148 n.); (3) the fact that Attica is a very natural pier of embarcation for dispossessed tribes. On the other hand, (1) and (2) may well have led to the invention of the tradition; and the noble genealogies of Ionia were traced back to Pylos (Strabo, 634, quoting Mimnermus) and not to Athens. This last point, however, is consistent with the tradition, which made Melanthus of Pylos king at Athens. On the whole, the balance of probability is for the traditional view, but it is possible that there was direct emigration from Argolis to Ionia: cf. the prominence of Hera-worship at Samos and at Argos. *kra=qis. This Crathis did not dry up in summer (a)e/nnaos); H. is interested in it from its namesake at Sybaris (v. 45. 1), which was not so permanent. *bou=ra. The tribe *bwrei=s, found at Cyzicus, Perinthus, and elsewhere, may possibly be connected with this town. mwri/h. H.'s argument is that the number 'twelve' is determined by history only, not by exclusive and superior purity in the Dodecapolis. He is obviously attacking some one (Intr. p. 25); cf. for a like acerbity of tone ii. 16. 1. Paus. vii. 2. 3-9 gives additional details as to this migration. *)/abantes. Aristotle (in Strabo, 445) said this tribe were Thracians, who passed from Abae in Phocis to Euboea. *minu/ai. The Minyans settled in Teos (Paus. vii. 3. 6), the Cadmeans (but cf. v. 61. 2 n.) in Priene (ib. vii. 2. 10) and in Colophon (ib. vii. 3. 1-3, where the oracle was connected with the daughter of Tiresias), the Dryopes in Styra (ib. iv. 34. 11), the Phocians in Phocaea (Paus. vii. 3. 10). These statements it is impossible to test; they may rest on genealogical evidence. No other tradition connects the Molossi (Thuc. i. 136. 2) who lived in the east of Epirus, north of Ambracia, with Asia Minor. Probably the reference is to some forgotten story, connecting Dodona (cf. Aesch. P. V. 829) with the migration to the East. Pausanias (vii. 4. 2) makes Ionians from Epidaurus (not Dorians) settle in Samos. The a)/lla e)/qnea are probably not Lydians and Carians (as Stein), but other Greek tribes from Hellas proper; H. mentions the admixture of native races below. a)poda/smioi. Cf. ii. 103. 2 a)podasa/menos. H. lays stress on the fact that Phocaea was founded by a part of the Phocians, who left their home by a voluntary migration, not from external compulsion; in this it resembled the later colonies, and not its contemporary foundations. The Arcadians are called 'Pelasgi', because they were au)to/xqones (cf. viii. 73. 1) and not immigrants, cf. 66. 2 n. prutanhi/ou. For connexion with Athens as a test of Ionism cf. 147. 2. H. writes as if prehistoric migrations had been carried out with the ceremonies of colony-founding in his own day; for the 'common hearth' cf. Frazer, iv. 441-2. The argument is again directed against Ionian pride of birth; even the purest-blooded of them had foreign wives and foreign rulers (147. 1); but the claims of Athens as mhtro/polis are asserted. Pausanias (vii. 2. 6) tells the same tale shortly. H. here seems to be incorporating in his argument a piece of very early custom. Among some savage tribes, e.g. the Caribs in North America, the wife neither eats with the husband nor calls him by his name (cf. Frazer, iv. 116). The myth of Cupid and Psyche preserves in a curious form this primitive separation of husband and wife. There may have been some strange survival of this at Miletus, but it can hardly have been as absolute as H. states. For Glaucus cf. Il. vi. 119 seq.; for his ceni/a with Diomede, ib. 215 seq.; the story may well reflect some early connexion of Greek settlers and native princes. For the Pylian families at Athens cf. Busolt, i. 287, n. 3, who thinks (following T\u00f6ppfer, Att. Geneal. 225 seq.) that the story of their migration to Asia via Attica is an Athenian invention; he argues that Peloponnesian wanderers would have gone directly by sea to Asia, which is most unlikely. It is true there never was a ge/nos of Nelidae at Athens; but then tradition was unanimous that the family had again migrated. For Pylians at Athens cf. v. 65. 3, Hell. fr. 10 (F. H. G. i. 47), Paus. ii. 18. 9. For the *kau/kwnes cf. iv. 148. 4 n. Homer (Od. iii. 357 seq., speech of Athena as Mentor) distinguishes the Caucones from Pylos, but puts them near at hand. *ko/drou. The rulers of Miletus were traditionally Nelidae, descended from Nileus the son of Codrus (ix. 97; Paus. vii. 2. 1). sunamfote/rous seems to imply a double kingship, the arrangement so familiar at Sparta (cf. vi. 51 n.). Kingship disappeared as a form of government in the eighth century or even later (cf. Busolt, ii. 455, n. 6, for its disappearance), and authority passed into the hands of an oligarchy claiming descent from the founder. Strabo (633) says that even in his own day the Codridae at Ephesus were called 'kings' and had honorary privileges. The Apaturia (see T\u00f6ppfer in P.-W. s. v.) was the festival (in the month Pyanepsion) of the Phratries at Athens, at which new members were enrolled; cf. Schol. Aristoph. Ach. 146, where its three days are described, and Xen. Hell. i. 7. 8 (its fatal influence on the trial of the generals in 406 B.C.). Various deities were connected with it, especially Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria. The derivation from the a)pa/th of Melanthus is an etymological legend; it really = o(mopato/ria, the gathering of 'fathers' (cf. a)/koitis). We can trace the festival widely, e.g. in the Aegean, at Cyzicus, and at Olbia; but the only inscription found as to it comes from the Crimea (? Phanagoria), I. G. A. 350. No doubt the cause of the absence of the Apaturia at Ephesus was the Orientalized character of that city; it was divided into five tribes, which are independent of the four Ionic tribes (c. 142 n.), except that one of its five had a sub-division 'Argadis'. Its worship of Artemis too was full of Eastern elements (cf. Strabo, 641). So Ephesus takes little part in Ionic revolt (vi. 8 n.; 16. 2). For an Oriental party in Colophon cf. Thuc. iii. 34. 1. The Panionium was in the territory of Priene (Strabo, 384, 639), three stades from the sea. It is identified at Tshangli, between Ephesus and Cape Trogilium (Leake, A. M. p. 260), at the northeast corner of the promontory; here the name has been found on an inscription (cf. Dittenberger, 189). *(elikw/nios would naturally mean 'of Helicon', and Farnell (C. G. S. iv. 29 seq.) argues that the neighbourhood of Mount Helicon must have been 'long the abiding home' of the Ionians, where they came in contact with the Minyae. There was a *(/ippou krh/nh, a fountain of the Poseidon horse, Pegasus, near its top (Paus. ix. 31. 3). If Farnell's view is right, the worship of Poseidon at Helice in Achaia (c. 145 n.) would have been only an isolated local cult. *paniw/nia. This religious amphictyony (cf. Freeman, Federal Government, p. 185 seq.) is as old as Homer (Il. xx. 404). It never developed into a complete political union, though it tended to do so (c. 170 n.). We have instances of united action in 141. 1, v. 108. 2, vi. 7. Thucydides (iii. 104) pointedly ignores this festival when he speaks of the gathering of the Ionians at Delos; but Strabo (u. s.) says it was still celebrated in the time of Augustus. Thucydides' festival was for the perikti/ones nhsiw=tai, not for Ionians only. tou=to: i.e. that the names end in a. Cf. c. 139 n. for Persian names. For the Aeolian migration cf. Busolt, i. 272 seq. It was tradition ally four generations earlier than the Ionian (Strabo, 582), and like it was connected with the Dorian invasion. It was, however, an even more gradual movement, and neither in conduct nor in results had it the unity which is attributed (no doubt in exaggeration) to the Ionian migration. There is no reason to doubt the tradition that connects the Aeolians especially with Thessaly and Boeotia (Thuc. iii. 2. 3; vii. 57. 5; viii. 5. 2, 100. 3); this is supported by the likeness of the Lesbian and the Boeotian dialects (e.g. broad vowels pw/nw for pi/nw, feminine endings in is and w; Busolt, i. 195, n. 2). The name Aeolis is used in four senses: (1) A district in south-west Thessaly (Apoll. i. 7. 3; F. H. G. i, p. 111; H. in vii. 95. 1 alludes to this sense). (2) The district of Calydon in Aetolia (Thuc. iii. 102. 5). (3) The twelve old Aeolic towns given here by H. (4) All the settlements in the northern half of the west coast of Asia Minor, about thirty in number. Cyme and Lesbos were the mhtropo/leis (Strabo, 622). The name 'Aeolian' (first used in Hes. W. and D. 636\u2014of Cyme) perhaps arose in Asia Minor, and was transferred back to Greece proper; it seems to be used of all 'colonies' which were neither Dorian nor Ionian. The name may be connected with ai)o/los, 'glancing, changeful.' For the identification of the 'old' Aeolic towns cf. B\u00e4hr, ad loc., and Ramsay, J. H. S. ii. 271 seq. Except Cyme, they were unimportant; only this town (Head, H. N. 552) and Pitane (ib. 537) issued coinage before the fourth century. They lay on or near the coast from south of the Hermus to the Caicus. *frikwni/s: so called to distinguish this Cyme from other towns of the same name; *f. is said to be derived from Mount Phricius over Thermopylae (Strabo, 621), but this is probably a mere invention; the epithet was shared by Larisa. *lh/risai: a form of the oft-recurring 'Pelasgic' *la/rissa. For h(/kein cf. 30. 4 n. Smyrna was Ionian before the twenty-third Olympiad (Paus. v. 8. 7), i.e. about the end of the eighth century. H. is confirmed by a poem of Mimnermus, who says (we himself represents the town as a colony of Ephesus; this is obviously an Ionian invention to justify their aggression. The town, however, lying more than ten miles south of the Hermus, and having Phocaea on the coast between it and Cyme, belonged naturally to the Ionian sphere. The Ida region stretched from the Gulf of Adramyttium to the Propontis. The 'Hundred Isles' lay between Lesbos and the mainland. Strabo (618) says their number was estimated at from twenty to forty, and that the name means 'Islands of Apollo', from his epithet *)/ekatos; Strabo quotes 'Peloponnesus' a similar nasalization of s.

For the con<*>ous question cf. v. 73. 2 (Artaphrenes), v. 105 (Darius after the burning of Sardis); it is most appropriate here. The words put into Cyrus' month bring out dramatically the contrast between the town life of the Greeks and the village life, feudal in its arrangements, of Persia; the rich Persians lived on presents or the produce of their land. Cf. Xen. Cyr. i. 2. 3-4 for a fancy picture of the e)leuqe/ra <*> (i.e. 'free' from trade) in Persia. Aristotle (Pol. i. 9, p. 1257) analyses the prejudice against to\\ kaphliko/n in his day, when the Greek attitude to trade had changed greatly from that of H. This passage is the best instance of the division of power among the officers of the Persian Empire (cf. Xen. Cyr. viii. 6. 1 and App. VI, \u00a7 7). Tabalus commands the garrison (cf. Mithrines at Sardis in Arr. Anab. i. 17. 3), Mazares (cc. 156-7) the field forces, while Pactyas has civil authority. If komi/zein = 'manage', this sense is common in Homer, e.g. Il. vi. 490ta\\ s' au)th=s e)/rga ko/mize, but rare later; Pactyas be a satrap with limited powers. But komi/zein may have its ordinary sense, 'bring,' i.e. to Ecbatana. In any case the position and behaviour of Pactyas resemble those of Harpalus under Alexander. Justin (i. 7) makes the Babylonian War, Ctesias (2. 3, p. 64), the wars with the Bactrians and Sacae, precede the attack on Sardis; the order of events in H. (73. 1 n.) is more probable. Justin (ib.) has an absurd story that all Greece was coming to attack Cyrus, had he not spared Croesus. For the subsequent conquests of Cyrus cf. c. 177 n.

Atarneus, a fertile district (vi. 28. 2), had belonged to the Mysians (viii. 106. 1). The dense population 40. 2; Beloch, Bev\u00f6lk., pp. 233-4) made it important for the island to secure a food-supply on the mainland. The Chians still had Atarneus in 398 B.C. (Xen.

The story of the Phocaeans. This digression is invaluable, as giving us our earliest evidence of the 'Barbarian Reaction' in the West, which kept the Greeks out of Corsica and west Sicily, and prevented the west Mediterranean from becoming a Greek lake. It was checked for more than half a century by the Deinomenidae, at Himera in 480 B.C. (vii. 166) and at Cumae in 474. For the whole subject cf. Bury, pp. 296 seq. These chapters are well discussed by Clerc in the R. E. G. xviii. 143 seq.; he proves that the later traditions (Antiochus, fr. 9; F. H. G. i. 183; Timagenes, ib. iii. 323) are mistaken, which attribute the foundation of Massilia, in whole or in part, to the exiles fleeing from Persia. This later date has been supported by Thuc. i. 13. 6; but the order of events in that chapter need not be chronological. prw/th|. Phocaea as leader is attacked first; cf. 152. 1 for a Phocaean spokesman. Harpagus changed the plan of campaign; Mazares had attacked the Ionian towns of the south (c. 161). The Thalassocracy of Phocaea is variously dated 602-560 and 577-533 J. H. S. xxvi, pp. 102-3). Cf. Thuc. i. 13. 6 for their foundation of Massilia (which H. does not mention, though he knows the town: v. 9. 3), and for their 'repeated victories' over the Carthaginians; by this colony they secured the 'tin-route' across Gaul. For their coinage cf. Hill, G. C. pp. 8-11; Head, H. N. 587-9; it was both early and widespread. The coins of Phocaea, with those of Mytilene and Cyzicus, formed the chief currency for the coast towns of west Asia till the time of Alexander. oi( katade/cantes. H. rightly lays stress on the Phocaeans being 'openers-up' (not the discoverers; cf. iv. 153. 2 for Samians at Tartessus) of the West. Their activity gave the name to the 'Ionian' sea, south of Italy. Myres (u. s., p. 102) refers these voyages to the last half of the eighth century, but Tartessus was a 'virgin' market in 630 B.C. when Colaeus discovered it. *)adri/hn. The Adriatic Sea (cf. iv. 33. 1), named from the Etruscan town of Adria, near the mouth of the Po (Liv. v. 33. 8). *)ibhri/hn: only mentioned here by H. (but Iberians among other western peoples: vii. 165. 1); probably he means north-east Spain near the Ebro. The Greeks had a colony here, Rhodae (hod. Rosas) near Emporiae; Strabo (654) ascribes it to the Rhodians before the first Olympiad, an impossible date; he adds that it was afterwards colonized by the Massiliots. Probably his statement is a mere etymological guess, and Rhodae was connected from the first with Massilia (and so with Phocaea), which certainly owned it later. *tarthsso/n: the region at the mouth of the Baetis, probably the Tarshish of the Old Testament (but cf. Hastings, D. B. s. v., where the evidence is fully given, for a different view). It was the Eldorado of the ancients (cf. Strabo, 146, for its gold, silver, brass, and iron); Stesichorus (Strabo, 148) sang of the a)rguro/rizoi pagai/ of the Tartessus river. Cf. Meyer, ii. 428-9, for the whole subject. The Phocaeans, like the Elizabethan navigators, were buccaneers (cf. 166. 1 and Dionysius of P., vi. 17 n.) as well as traders; hence the character of their ships. The penteconter was the main Greek ship-of-war in the sixth century, although Thucydides (i. 13. 2-3) says that the Corinthians were building triremes by 700 B.C. (this is his meaning, in spite of Torr, A. S. p. 4, n. 8). The Samian and the Phocaean navies were mainly composed of penteconters; they had, however, a few triremes (Thuc. i. 14. 1). H.'s details as to Samos (contrast iii. 39. 3 and 44. 2) confirm this view, that the navies of the period were mixed. Thucydides further seems to suggest that large fleets of triremes were first formed in Sicily and at Corcyra. The lighter penteconter would be used in preference for a long voyage or for a piratical raid. In the penteconter there were twenty-five oars a side; but the principle of superimposed banks may be as old as the Homeric Catalogue (Il. ii. 510\u2014the Boeotian ships have 120 men each; cf. Thuc. i. 10. 4). For its use in Phoenician warships as early as 700 B.C. cf. Torr, p. 4, and figs. 10 and 11. The longevity of Arganthonius was proverbial (cf. Anacreon, fr. 8, in Strabo, 151); that he reigned eighty years is accepted as prope certum by Pliny (N. H. vii. 156), who gives (154-5) an amusing string of instances, ending li/qwn mega/lwn. The wall obviously had been seen by H. (cf. 141. 1 n.). katirw=sai, 'consecrate,' as a sign of submission, which was to be at once material and symbolical. bouleu/sasqai. Probably Phocaea was actually besieged, and these negociations took place during an interval in the siege. Harpagus' offer can hardly have been genuine, for Cyrus had refused to accept submission on terms less favourable to the Greeks (c. 141). The Phocaeans on their part were probably seeking to gain time, so as to be able to escape by sea. The Chians were friendly with the Milesians (18. 3 n.) and the league trading East, the Phocaeans with the league trading West (cf. iii. 59. 4 n.). The Oenussian Islands lie between Chios and the mainland. e)k qeopropi/ou. This passage throws interesting light on the policy and methods of the Delphic oracle. The Pythia not unnaturally wished to secure for Hellenism one of the keys of the west Mediterranean (cf. v. 43 for a similar attempt in west Sicily). For this Delphic policy cf. Curtius ii. 37-42 (though he exaggerates it); Holm (i. 232) thinks the oracle simply sanctioned projects suggested to it by would-be colonists. But probably it also originated projects itself (cf. v. 42. 2 n.). mu/dron. Cf. Hor. Epod. xvi. 17-26, and for a similar sanction to the Delian league Ath. Pol. 23ad fin. *ku/rnon. Antiochus (fr. 9, F. H.

The Etruscans were at this time at the height of their power; not improbably they ruled Rome in the sixth century; the Romans, on becoming free, made a treaty with Carthage in 509 B.C. (Polyb. 3. 22). The occupation of Alalia was a direct challenge to the Etruscans, and no doubt it was the common danger from the Greeks which led them to form the commercial treaty with Carthage spoken of by Aristotle (Pol. iii. 9. 6; 1280 a). A Cadmean victory was a proverb, derived from the mutual slaughter of the two sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polynices, in the war of 'the Seven against Thebes'. e)mbo/lous: acc. of respect; lit.

Myers, Hellenica, p. 455; for the curse on offspring cf. vi. 139. 2 n. sfi: the dead Phocaeans. The atonement consisted in setting up Greek games in their honour as heroes; the connexion of funeral games with the dead is as old as Il. xxiii; for other examples cf. Frazer, ii. 549-50.

Oenotria (Strabo, 209) is the toe of Italy 'from the Sicilian strait to the Tarentine Gulf'. *(ge/lh: i.e. Elia or Velia, so famous in the history of philosophy. For 'paltering in a double sense' on the part of Oracles cf. iii. 64. 4 n. *ku/rnon: a son of Heracles (Serv. ad Verg. Ec. ix. 30). Heracles is the pioneer of Greek enterprise, cf. v. 43; there is no need to conjecture e(/los e)o/nta, in reference to the fact that Velia was founded in a marsh (Dion. Halic. i. 20). The name 'Abdera' is perhaps Phoenician (Strabo, 157). Abdera coined with the griffin of Teos as type, but it followed the Phoenician heavy standard (Head, H. N. 253 seq.). The town was famous as the birthplace of Democritus and Protagoras, yet its people were proverbially stupid (for their idea of wit cf. vii. 120). For the site cf. vii. 126 n.

Chios had territory on mainland (160. 3 n.), so too had Lesbos, but H. here is speaking of 'Ionians' only. As the Ionians had command of the sea they could still meet at Mycale. For Bias cf. 27. 2 n.; Mahaffy (G. L. i. 198) thinks a fragment of his poem urging migration is preserved in Theognis, 757-68. Sardinia was barred to the Greeks by Carthage; hence, on the principle of omne ignotum pro magnifico, they exaggerated its size; the Italian official figures are for Sicily 9860 square miles, for Sardinia 9187 (E. B.11 xxv. 20, xxiv. 210). Cf. v. 106. 6, 'Scylax' Perip. 114, and Timaeus (in Strabo, 654) for the mistake, which has been revived by Freeman (Sicily, i. 2, 241). Strabo (123) was the first writer to give the real proportion. Cf. v. 124. 2 for another proposal to conquer Sardinia. Corsica was already (c. 165) partially held by Phocaeans. *foi/nikos. 'Plutarch' (de Mal. Herod. 15) attacks this statement, as 'making Thales barbarian'; H. only means that he was descended from the Thelidae, original settlers of Miletus, who were descended from Cadmus. As the father of Thales bore a Carian name (Examius, Diog. Laer. i. 1. 22), he probably had non-Hellenic blood in him. Thales' proposal shows the practical wisdom for which he was ranked among the Seven Sages (27. 2 n.); he alone of these was also a philosopher. His proposal was to secure united action by a genuine federal government (cf. Freeman, F. G. pp. 187-90). Thucydides (ii. 15.2) uses almost the same phrases of the supposed work of Theseus in Attica, and H. seems to think the proposal of Thales was for complete political unification, as he says the cities were to be mere 'demes'; but Thales can only have meant that the e(/n bouleuth/rion was to control foreign relations. Teos was not chosen only for its central position; its insignificance would prevent it being dangerous to the independence of the federated states. So Washington (not New York) was made capital of the United States. Of the Carians and Leleges may well be quoted the words of Strabo (322), when, after describing the wide diffusion of the Leleges, he says (speaking of north-west Greece): 'Now that most of the land has become desolate, and the settlements and especially the cities have disappeared, even if a man could give a definite account, he would do nothing useful, owing to the uncertainty (a)doci/a) and to the fact that the peoples have disappeared, a movement which began long since.' The best English accounts are those of Myres and Paton, J. H. S. xvi. 264 seq., and (of the Leleges) of Holm, i. 63-4, 72. The following are the most important points as to the two races: I. In Asia Minor. (1) In Homer (Il. x. 428-9) Dolon places them both with the Lycians, Mysians, and Phrygians among the allies of Troy. In the Catalogue (ii. 867) the Carians are barbaro/fwnoi, and inhabit Miletus. (2) Leleges are placed by Homer at Pedasus in the Troad (Il. xxi. 86-7), but do not occur in 'the Catalogue'. (3) Strabo (321, 611) tells us that ancient and forts' in Caria were called 'Lelegian'. (4) Philippus, a Carian writer of the third century B. C., makes the Leleges serfs of the Carians; Plutarch (Qu. Gr. 46; Mor. 302) says that the survivors of the Leleges were serfs at Tralles. We may conclude they were genuine tribes on the Anatolian coast, of whom the Carians were the later comers and the conquerors. The two races were often identified, especially as the Carians seem to have adopted the speech of their subjects; for two races in Caria cf. 171. 6. II. In Greece proper. (1) Carians are traced at Megara (citadel called 'Caria', Paus. i. 6), in the Argolid at Epidaurus and Hermione (Strabo, 374, quoting Aristotle), at Athens (Isagoras, H. v. 66. 1). But the last instance proves nothing, and the first may be connected with the later military importance of the Carians. (2) Leleges are mentioned continually as early inhabitants, e.g. Strabo, 321-2 (quoting Arist.), in Acarnania, Aetolia, Boeotia, &c. This is probably invention based (a) on the fact that the Leleges, like the Pelasgians, are merely a prehistoric stop-gap; where nothing was known they were put in; (b) on resemblances of placenames in Caria and in central Greece (Busolt, i. 185. 4 n.), e.g. Abae in Caria and in Phocis. We may conclude that there is no sufficient evidence for the presence of Carians and Leleges in Greece proper. III. But it is not unlikely that the primitive population of Greece and of Anatolia was really akin; we find place-names ending in -nqos, -nda (and perhaps -assos, -asa) common to both regions, and a number of words 'earthy of the soil', e.g. bo/linqos, with a similar termination (cf. Conway's list, B. S. A. viii. 155). We may also compare the primitive cist-graves of Assarlik in Caria with the pre-Mycenaean graves in the Cyclades. So the double axe was a symbol of the Carians, but perhaps they and the Cretans borrowed it equally from some earlier people. (For this view generally cf. Mackenzie, B. S. A. xii, p. 217 seq.) The double axe seems to be the symbol also of the Hittite god, Tesub. IV. The races in the islands. Greek theory made the Carians native in the islands (171. 2; Thuc. i. 4. 1, 8. 1, though with differing details). Thucydides seeks to confirm this by archaeological evidence; but the weapons found in the island-graves do not resemble the Carian weapons of c. 171. Probably, therefore, the native tradition is right (171. 5), that they were originally a mainland people, and the Greek tradition is a mere inference from the Thalassocracy of Minos. There were Carians in the islands, however, in the ninth and eighth centuries (v. i.). V. The theory once maintained that the Carians were the authors of the Mycenaean culture (e.g. by K\u00f6hler and D\u00fcmmler) must be abandoned, in view of the facts that hardly any Mycenaean remains are found in Caria, and those found show the culture in its decadence (J. H. S. xvi. 265). VI. For the affinities of the Carians with the Indo-European races cf. App. I, \u00a7 4. The Carians seem to have been the advanced guard of the tribes that invaded Anatolia from the north at the end of the second millennium B. C. Conway (u. s. 156) thinks the Carian names may belong to the Indo-European family of speech. If this be denied (with Kretschmer), we may suppose the conquerors adopted the language of the conquered earlier population. It is to this later conquering element we must attribute: (1) The Carian Thalassocracy (Myres, J. H. S. xxvi. 107-9). There were Carians in the islands at the time of the Greek settlement (171. 5). (2) The characteristic Carian weapons (171. 4 n.). (3) The Carian mercenaries of the seventh century (ii. 152. 5). trica\\ e)ceurh/mata. This passage is of great importance for our knowledge of Greek armour. The difference between the weapons of Homeric and those of later times is well known; H. here attributes three changes to the Carians, who were prominent as mercenaries in the seventh and sixth centuries (cf. Helbig, Hom. Ep., p. 344; Archil. fr. 24; and ii. 152, 154, v. 111. 1). The statement is repeated by Strabo (661), who also credits the Carians with greaves. H. has grasped the difference between the huge body-covering shield (h)u/te pu/rgos) [Lang, Homer and his Age, 110 f. compares the shields in the Bayeux Tapestry and refutes the theory that they were only used in a chariot] and the round shield of manageable size, borne on the left arm. Some (e.g. Tsountas, p. 193) think he is wrong as to the 'badges', and refer to the 'stars' on Mycenaean shields and the well-known shield of Achilles of Il. 18. Curtius, however (Ges. Abh. ii. 89), accepts the statement of H., who is probably referring to some particular form of badge, which was specially Carian. With regard to lo/fos and o)/xanon Strabo *karikoerge\\s o)/xanon. H. must have known. Hence he may be referring to the later form of crest which fits right on the helmet, as opposed to the earlier form which was raised on a ku/mbaxos (Il. xv. 536); the two forms of crests in the Euphorbus plate (Brunn, Griech. Kunstg. (1893), fig. 114). With the later form comes in the more frequent use of cheek-pieces to the helmet, which, by hiding the face, would make 'badges' more necessary. The o)/xanon (or o)xa/nh) is used by the Schardana on the Egyptian monuments of the thirteenth century (Helbig, Hom. Ep., fig. 124, at Ipsambul); the 'shield-band', therefore, may have been borrowed by the Carians from an earlier Anatolian race. The 'band' (of metal, wood, or leather) was placed across the diameter of the shield from rim to rim (cf. picture in D. of A., s. v. 'Clipeus'); the shield also had a grip (po/rpac) of leather running round inside the rim. Hence po/rpac and o)/xanon are used as convertible (Schol. to Arist. Eq. 849). They were, however, properly distinct; the conservative Spartans used only the po/rpac till the third century (Plut. Cleom. 11). The 407; Helb., pp. 324-57), but it more probable these latter are the r(a/bdoi of Hesych. (s. v.), the stiffening rods in the centre of the leather shield. Cf. Leaf, Iliad, vol. i, App. B, for this and other points as to Homeric armour. perikei/menoi. We have a shield hung from the left shoulder (cf. Il. xvi. 106o( d' a)ristero\\n w)=mon e)/kamnen | e)/mpedon ai)e\\n e)/xwn in the famous hunting scene on the dagger-blade from the fourth grave at Mycenae (Helbig, fig. 125); Reichel (Hom. Waff., p. 10) elaborately explains the working of the shield. In Il. v. 795-7 (cf. Il. v. 98), however, Diomede has his shield telamw/n on his right shoulder. This early shield also had a 'grip', which H. takes for granted; this omission hardly justifies Helbig's criticism, 'H. either did not understand the old use or has expressed himself obscurely' (p. 323). To perikei/menoi supply telamw=nas. The reason for placing the 'shield belt' on the left shoulder was that the sword belt had to be on the right one (Il. xiv. 404-5), as the sword itself was on the left side, so as to be drawn more easily. u(/steron: i. e. at the time of the Greek colonization, about 1000 B.

C. ii. 199) who says the Australians 'annually drive from their midst the accumulated ghosts of the last year's dead'. So too the modern Greek will discharge firearms to drive away an earthquake. The Lycians are as great a racial and linguistic puzzle as the Carians. Their language is usually thought to be Indo-European, on account of the resemblance of its inflexions to those of Greek; but it has not yet been satisfactorily explained, and its connexion with Greek is very doubtful, Meyer i. 476. The name 'Lycian' may be explained: (1) As that of a conquered Anatolian tribe. Cf. the Luka of the great Egyptian invasions (App. X. 8), and the sea-roving Lukki of the Tell El-Amarna Tablets. (2) Or, more probably, as a Greek name derived from a confusion of Apollo *lu/keios (the wolf god) with the deity of Patara (Farnell, G. C. iv. 113). The geographical position of the Lycians on the sea-coasts seems to confirm the tradition of their origin as immigrants e)k *krh/ths. They borrowed much from Greece, includ ing partially their alphabet, but retained their nationality and political individuality (for the Lycian League cf. Freeman, F. G. p. 208 seq.). Their abundant coinage is evidence of great prosperity in fifth and fourth centuries (Head, H. N. 688 seq.). This Sarpedon is grandfather (Diod. v. 79) of the Homeric hero, the leader of the Lycians (Il. pass.). Milyas (iii. 90. 1) is in historic times the high ground north-east of Lycia, as far as Pisidia (Strabo, 631). As no Lycian remains are found here, it was inhabited probably by a distinct people (cf. Arr. Anab. i. be the name of the original inhabitants, who were driven into the mountains; so in Il. vi. 184, 204, they are enemies of the Lycians. Strabo (631) says the neighbouring tribe, the Kabaleis (iii. 90 n.), were thought to be 'Solymi', and Steph. Byz. (s. v. *pisidi/a) says the same of the Pisidians. The name *termi/lai is confirmed by quotations from Hecataeus and Panyasis (fr. 364, F. H. G. i. 30; iii. 236), and by the TRXM*lI of the Harpagus obelisk in the British Museum. The aetiological myth as to the name 'Lycians' is part of the expansion of the Theseus story (Aegeus was the human father of Theseus), which accompanied the rise of Athenian power under and after the Pisistratidae (Bury, i. 213). For explanations of, and parallels to (e.g. Tacitus, Germania, c. 20), this interesting survival of primitive usage cf. Westermarck, cap. v; he argues that it does not prove (as McLennan thought) a time when promiscuity was the rule and paternity uncertain. In many most primitive tribes (W. gives a list, pp. 98 seq.) kinship through males was the rule. Kinship through females may be based on various ideas, e.g. the fact that 'paternity is a matter of inference, maternity of observation' (Maine), on the closer connexion between mothers and their children, or on primitive polygamy. It is confirmed for Lycia by Il. vi. 196-206; Sarpedon, the sister's son, is chief, and the male heir, Glaucus, subordinate. Probably the usage belongs to the primitive Anatolian stock; cf. App. I. 3. *lakedaimoni/wn. Strabo (653) brings the Cnidians from Megara. Tr. 'As their territory lies towards the sea, being called Triopion, beginning from the Chersonese of Bybassia'; to/ is neuter from attraction of the predicate *trio/pion. Properly *trio/pion is the name only of the extreme point. oi( *kni/dioi takes up oi(/ of \u00a7 2; but the whole section is a model of confusion. It is to be noticed that H., as a Halicarnassian, knows the Cnidian territory minutely. The oracle, for which H. does not vouch (cf. w(s au)toi\\ ktl.), looks like an ex post facto excuse for non-resistance. The isthmus still shows traces of the unfinished cutting. For Pedasus cf. v. 121 n. This part of Caria was again the only one that resisted at the time of the Ionic revolt (v. 119-21); this may be connected with the fact that the Leleges were especially at home here. tri/s. This portent is mentioned again (viii. 104 n.) in almost the same words, but as having only happened 'twice'; if both passages be genuine, they clearly prove that Bk. I was written later, but the words in Bk. VIII are probably a gloss. sunh/lisan. A like desperation was shown against Brutus in 42 B.C. (App. B. C. iv. 80, who says it had been shown also against Alexander in 334: this is obviously wrong; cf. Arr. Anab. i. 24. 4). e)kdhme/ousai. For a parallel in the Fabius who survived the Cremera (477 B.C.) cf. Liv. ii. 50. Some explain their absence by their having gone up into the hills in the summer. Harpagus seems to have become hereditary satrap of Lycia (though there were also native rulers; cf. vii. 98 n.). A descendant of his, Karmis (?), was ruler there about 430 B.C., and is commemorated on the Xanthian Stele in the British Museum (l. 5, Hicks, No. 56, pp. 96-7; Meyer, iv. 683, refers it to 413 B.C.): it is suggested that the 'triquetra' of the Lycian coins may be a pun on the family name (a(rpa/gh = a hook); but Head (H. N. 688) makes it a solar symbol connected with the Apollo cult. Resumption of story of Cyrus. 177-83 Description of Babylon. 184-7 Works of Semiramis and Nitocris. 188-91 Capture Cyrus. 192-200 Description of 215-16 Geographical of Massagetae. 204-14 expedition against Massagetae and his death. Pr\u00e1ek (i. 224-5) interprets H. as placing the wars in the east against the Bactrians, Sacae, &c., before the attack on Babylon. This is against the order of names in 153. 4, and also against probability (cf. also 190. 1 n.); the passage here obviously gives no chronological evidence. That Cyrus, however, extended his rule to the Jaxartes is likely in itself, and is confirmed by the list of satrapies in the B. I. (App. VII, \u00a7 1). It is confirmed too by the position of Kyra, which claimed to be his foundation, on the river Jaxartes (Strabo 517), and by the story of the Arimaspi as eu)erge/tai of Cyrus (cf. viii. 85. 3 n.); they saved his army on the north borders of the Gedrosian desert. For ancient Babylon the main authority is the East India House inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, 619 lines long (quoted as E. I. H. from R. P.2 iii. 104 seq.). The best English account is that of Pinches, in the Enc. Bib. (s. v. Babylon). H. is our oldest Greek witness; Sayce (Introd. p. 28 seq.) denies that he ever visited Babylonia, but this view has not been generally accepted. Cf. Baumstark in P. W. (about 1896) s. v. Babylon, 'that [H.'s statements] really rest on his own observation, should never have been disputed. But it is also indisputable that in them what the writer has himself seen and what he was told by his oriental guides, is mixed up in a suspicious way' (ii. 2689). F. H. Weissbach, however, Das Stadtbild von Babylon (1904, Der Alte Orient V), produces a plan of Babylon based on recent German excavations (still going on), which differs entirely from the account of H. or of any other Greek writer; Weissbach (p. 15) indeed claims the support of Berosus, who says (F. H. G. ii. 507) trace of peri/boloi on W.'s plan. This plan, not to mention other difficulties, represents Babylon as having no defence on the west except the river Euphrates, which is absurd. It is therefore ignored here. (See Note G, p. 451.) H. includes (cf. iv. 39. 1) under 'Assyria' the whole region between the Iranian plateau, Armenia, and the desert; this province (for its history cf. iii. 92. 1) is called 'Assyria' also in the Minaean inscriptions (from South Arabia, which go back to ninth century B. C.). Hence in his *)assu/rioi lo/goi (cf. App. II, \u00a7 6) H. includes both the Assyrian and the Babylonian Empire (cc. 106, 184). The confusion was natural, owing to (1) H.'s ignorance, especially of Assyria. (2) The identity of their religion and culture. (3) The fact that Babylon was often a vassal of Nineveh. But the two empires were historically and ethnographically distinct. We may compare the similar identification of Medes and Persians by the Greeks. a)/lla poli/smata: this is correct; the land is full of ruins. Cf. a striking passage in Layard, Nineveh and Babylon (1853), p. 245, beginning 'On all sides, as far as eye could see, rose the grasscovered heaps, marking the site of ancient habitations. The great tide of civilization had long since ebbed, leaving the wrecks on the solitary shore'. This refers to the district west of Mosul, i. e. near the site of Nineveh. me/gaqos and me/twpon (= 'side'; elsewhere kw=lon) are bold anacoluthon. ei)/kosi kai\\ e(kato/n. There are four main questions as to the walls of Babylon: I. Are the two walls, outer and inner, mentioned by H., the Imgur Bel and Nimitti Bel of E. I. H. viii. 43-6? Their identity is accepted by Baumstark (u. s.), Maspero (iii. 563), and others, but denied by the recent excavators, e. g. Weissbach (p. 12). This point does not affect H.'s narrative. II. Had H. seen either or both walls? (1) Berosus (F. H. G. ii. 508) says that Cyrus 'arranged to destroy the outer walls', because Babylon was 'troublesome and hard to take'. But this statement seems inconsistent with the fact that he entered the city peaceably as a deliverer (App. IV, \u00a7 1). (2) H. himself says (iii. usually explained as referring to the outer wall, and meaning that this had ceased to exist before H.'s visit. H. then either would be describing the outer wall from hearsay (Baumstark), or (as Lehmann, Klio, i. 274; cf. H. iii. 150. 1 n.) incorporating whole passages from Hecataeus (cf. the tenses of e)nesta=si 179. 3, and kei=tai 181. 5). But there is no good evidence that Hecataeus had ever been in Babylon, or that H. copied him (Introd. \u00a7 20), and either alternative seriously prejudices the credit of H. (3) It is more natural to suppose, as the words pu/las ... a)pe/spase in fact imply, that Darius simply dismantled the outer wall. He left Babylon in the state which Scott (in Quentin Durward) describes at Li\u00e9ge. To remove such enormous masses of brickwork entirely would have been at once difficult and needless. H. throws in touches which rest mainly on hearsay (e. g. 179. 3, the presence of the 'brazen' gates), but he had seen enough of the wall to warrant him describing it as existing. III. The extent of the walls. (1) H.'s figure of 480 stades is supported by the statement of Philostratus, supposed to be derived from Hellanicus (see P. W. ii. 2693). Oppert's attempt to trace the line of this great square on the modern site is now given up; Weissbach (p. 30) says it is fifty times too big; but Nikel [Herodot und die Keilschriftforschung (1896), pp. 25-7] points out that the extent of the ruins (roughly fifteen miles by twelve) corresponds to H.'s figures, which are accepted by Baumstark and Lehmann (u. s.). If this is right, the outer wall included the neighbouring town of Borsippa (cf. 181. 2 n.), which had also a wall of its own. Many, however, maintain Borsippa was quite separate from Babylon, following Berosus (F. H. G. ii. 508). The recent excavations render somewhat doubtful the enormous size of Babylon; but as Lehmann points out (u. s.), even if their results were more certain than they are, the literary tradition is very strong, and walls of brick might disappear, leaving little or no trace (cf. 179. 1 n.). (2) The figures of other Greek writers are smaller, e.g. Ctesias (Ass. fr. 5, p. 397) gives 360 365 stades, Cleitarchus (in Diod. ii. 7; he was one of historians of Alexander) the same; B\u00e4hr (Ctesias, pp. 401-4) collects all the evidence. These are taken as being the extent of the inner wall, which (Abydenus, F. H. G. iv. 284) lasted down to the time of Alexander. Of course all this vast area was not inhabited. At any rate H. is only giving the estimate he had received; he could not have measured even one side (contrast ii. 127. 1). For the size of Babylon cf. Arist. Pol. iii. height of the walls. H.'s estimate, about 335 feet by 85, to some extent agrees with that of Ctesias, who gives 50 fathoms (i.e. 300 feet, Diod. ii. 7). Nebuchadnezzar describes his wall as 'mountains high' (E. I. H. viii. 51; cf. Jer. li. 53), and Xenophon makes the ruined wall of Nineveh (with its base, krhpi/s) 150 feet high and 50 feet wide (Anab. iii. 4. 10-11; perhaps he is including the mound on which it stood). Strabo (738, with whom Diod. ii. 7 and Q. Curt. v. 1 agree), however, makes the wall of Babylon only 32 feet thick and 75 high (90 in the towers). H. probably follows the exaggerated figures of his guide. Maspero (iii. 563), who gives a picture of a conjectural restoration, makes the height of Nimitti Bel, the main wall, 30 metres, i. e. not quite 100 feet), and says it 'resembled rather a chain of mountains with battlements and towers than a boulevard of man's handiwork'. H.'s wall is not broad enough for stability in proportion to its height, and it is possible that he even underestimated its thickness; that of Khorsabad, which is much lower, is nearly 80 feet thick. He is quite right in saying that there was a walled ditch (178. 3; 179. 2) in front of the outer wall, and that inside there was a second wall 'of less extent' (181. 1 steino/teron). For the walls generally cf. E. I. H. col. 8. To sum up, it may be said that H. gives a striking impressionist picture of this great scheme of fortification, but that it is incorrect in details. e)keko/smhto. Babylon was undoubtedly the most splendid city in the East, when the great works of Nebuchadnezzar were complete. Cf. E. I. H. pass. and Dan. iv. 30. For the 'royal' and the 'ordinary cubit' cf. F. Hultsch, Metrologie (1882), especially pp. 46, 388. H. illustrates the Oriental measures from the Greek; but to us the process is reversed, as we know the Oriental measures, from measurements of Babylonian bricks and buildings, better than the Greek. The 'royal cubit' (which was practically the same as the Egyptian royal cubit, though a fraction longer, ib. p. 552) is calculated at from 532 (or 533) to 525 millimetres; the Greek cubit, therefore, being in the relation of 8 to 9 (the 'finger' is 7/10 of an inch), was from 473 to 466.6 millimetres. Stein, however, says the relation is 7 to 8, not 8 to 9, basing this on the length of the Attic ell, i. e. 462 millimetres. The Samian cubit was the same as the Egyptian ell (ii. 168. 1); of this there were two kinds, the 'royal', about 527 millimetres (Hultsch, p. 355), the smaller about 450. That the Samian corresponded to the former, i. e. the longer ell, has been finally proved by the measurements at the Samian Heraeum (ib. p. 551). e(lku/santes it corresponds The passage is parodied in Aristophanes' Aves, 552; cf. i. 3 n. Babylonia, owing to the absence of building stone, was the special home of brick-work. Crude bricks were used inside the walls, and even the baked bricks, from their larger size, were inferior in hardness to Roman, and to good modern, brick. Hence the wall was liable to be destroyed by water (cf. the tradition as to the fall of Nineveh (Ctes. Ass. fr. 16, p 437; Diod. ii. 27), and to become in ruins a shapeless mass (cf. Lehmann, u. s.). It was to hinder destruction by water that the 'mats of reed' (tarsou\\s k.) were 'stuffed in' (diastoiba/zontes), but really at much more frequent 'intervals' (dia/) than H. gives. a)sfa/ltw|. On 'bitumen' for 'mortar' (te/lma) cf. E. B. s. v., and Gen. xi. 3 (A. V. 'slime'); it was used mixed with clay. The inscriptions (E. I. H. cols. 7 and 8) confirm H. as to this. do/mwn, 'layers.' Cf. ii. 127. 3 to\\n in iii. 156. 1 and Strabo, 738, and promaxew=nes in iii. 151. 1) served as guard-houses; no doubt they were machicolated. e)nesta=si. For the tense v. s. The gates were probably 'plated with brass'; hence pa=sai is distributive 'all of them'. H. reckons a day's journey on the flat at 200 stadia (iv. 101. 2), i. e. about 23 miles; but Hit lies only about 125 miles north of Babylon. Matzat (Hermes, vi. 445) suggests that the explanation of H.'s larger figures lies in the river windings at Ardericca (185. 2 n.); the road, he thinks, would follow the river. Hit is still the chief source of bitumen for Babylonia; there are two springs, one cold and one hot; 'the whole place is redolent of sulphuretted hydrogen' (Peters, in E. B.11 s. v. Hit). a)gkw=nas. Literally 'is carried down as to its angles', i. e. 'is carried down at an angle'. The river rampart (ai(masih/, i. e. a rougher kind of wall) and the city wall made a salient angle, excellent for purposes of defence. e)pikampai/. 'From this point the return-walls stretch in the form of a rampart along each quay' (xei=los): paratei/nei is attracted into the singular to agree with ai(masih/. The quays (Diod. ii. 8) were 160 stades long; parts of them were discovered by the French explorers in 1853; the bricks bear the name of Nabonidus. H. (186. 2) attributes them to Nitocris, the mother of the last king, Labynetus (188. 1 n.), who in part corresponds to the historic Nabonidus. The Euphrates was navigable by sea-going ships up to Babylon (Strabo, 739). The streets were some of them (a)/llai) parallel to the river, others were cross-roads (e)pika/rsiai, cf. iv. 101. 3) leading to it; the latter were merely 'alleys' or 'wynds' (lau=rai). Streets which ran parallel to the river could hardly be 'straight', but H. exaggerates this feature, from their contrast to the winding streets of a Greek town. puli/des. H. carefully distinguishes these 'little gates' from the main pu/lai of 179. 3. ta\\ basilh/ia. The question of the palaces and temples of Babylon is one of the most disputed in H. The following facts may be taken as fairly certain: (1) That there were three palaces: (a) That on the right bank built by Nebuchadnezzar, in which Alexander died. (ta\\ pe/ran basi/leia, Plut. Alex. 76; Arr. Anab. vii. 25. These authorities are specially important as quoting ai( basi/leioi e)fhmeri/des as to Alexander's last days.) (b) That on the left bank, close to the temple of Merodach (cf. E. I. H. viii. 31 seq.). (c) Another built by Nebuchadnezzar to the north. As this was built in fifteen days (E. I. H. cols. 8 and 9, and Berosus, F. H. G. ii. 507) it was less important. (2) That there were two pre-eminent temples, that of Bel Merodach or Marduk in Babylon proper, on the left bank of the river (the 'Esagila'), and that of Bel Nebo in Borsippa, on the right bank of the river (the 'Ezida'). (3) That one palace (viz. 1 b above) has been proved to be identical with the mound of El Qasr, and the 'Esagila' temple (less certainly) with Tell Amran. (4) That Xerxes destroyed the great temple of Bel-Marduk in the centre of Babylon (Arr. Anab. vii. 17. 2); Strabo (738) calls it o( tou= *bh/lou ta/fos, but this is obviously the terraced tower, the ziggurat, the most important part of the Esagila. There are, the, two main difficulties in the account of H.: (1) He mentions only one palace and one temple, although in this there is a lower shrine ka/tw nho/s (183. 1), distinct from the great ziggurat of c. 181. (2) He claims to have seen the temple; but if, as is probable, Xerxes had destroyed the Esagila, he could not have seen it. Three explanations may be given (disregarding that of Sayce, that H. had never been in Babylon): (1) Baumstark in P. W. thinks the 'palace' of H. is that on the right bank, and that he does not mention the palace on the left bank, because he considers it part of the Esagila temple; it actually was close to it (v. s.). How H. could describe a temple which had probably ceased to exist, Baumstark does not explain; presumably this is one of the 'suspicious confusions' of which he speaks. (2) Hommel (in Hastings, D. B. s. v. Babel) says that Arrian and Strabo were mistaken. Because Xerxes removed the statue from Esagila (cf. 183. 3), they thought he had destroyed the temple. This explanation is possible; a brick building dismantled about 480 B.C. would speedily fall into decay, and though H. might have seen it in fair repair circ. 450 B.C., it might well need rebuilding, as Alexander proposed, in 323 (Strabo, Arrian, u. s.). (3) The most probable explanation, however, is that of Lehmann (Klio, i. 273-5), that by the 'temple of Belus' H. means the Nebo temple in Borsippa. H. distinctly says his temple was on the other side of the river (e)n tw=| e(te/rw|) from the palace; and as both Marduk and Nebo were called Bel ('Lord'), H. may well have confused them, and transferred the story of the statue to the Nebo temple. In fact it is not unlikely that the priests told him falsely that the perished statue had been in their temple, though it had never belonged to them. It will be seen (184 n.) that H. had special knowledge of the Nebo temple, and that he carefully avoids saying where the statue had stood; he leaves it e)n tw=| teme/nei+ (183. 2). The Borsippa temple is the best preserved of the ruins of Babylon, because of the imperishable material, blue slag, of which its uppermost story was formed. The present mound, Birs-Nimrud, is 153 feet high; its circumference is given variously, by Rich, 762 yards; by Rawlinson, 694 (ii. 582); H. gives 811 (four stades, \u00a7 3) for the lowest story, or rather for the brick platform on which it was raised. It may be noted that H. does not give the absurd height (606 feet) which Strabo (738) gives to the ta/fos *bh/lou. stades round (du/o stadi/wn pa/nth|), is the sacred te/menos in which the tower stood. It will be noticed that H. says nothing (in this agreeing with E. I. H.) of the famous hanging gardens attributed to Nebuchadnezzar by Berosus (F. H. G. ii. 507); cf. 185. 1 n. pu/rgos. For the eight stories cf. the Cyrus tomb at Murghab (125. 3 n.). H. is undoubtedly describing a tower with one story set upon another, each decreasing in size, and thus the ziggurat is usually restored (cf. Rawlinson, ii. 583-4, for picture). But Meyer, i. 380 n., says it was a rounded cone, with a sloping way winding about it to the top; he follows E. Herzfeld (Samarra, 1907), who gives a beautiful picture of the still-existing minaret of the Samarra mosque, which, he claims, embodies the idea of the old ziggurat. The form is certainly very primitive, and Herzfeld maintains that the sun-burned bricks were not strong enough for such a tower as H. describes. The Babylonians had, however, kiln-baked bricks as well, and there is no sufficient reason for describing H.'s view as mistaken. For the table of Bel cf. the story of Bel and the Dragon in the Apocrypha; for the deity consuming his offerings cf. viii. 41. 2 n. and Tylor, P. C. ii. 380 seq., who quotes parallels among modern savages. For divine amours cf. Josephus, Antiq. xviii. 3. 4 (of Anubis at Rome); and Strabo 816 (at Thebes). The carvings at Luxor and Deir el Bahari support the story (cf. ii. 143. 4 n.). It is possible, however, that H. may be misled by Egyptian titles; connected with the temple of Amon were his 'singing women', chief among whom was 'the wife of the god'. These are to be distinguished from the i(ero/douloi, and were often women of good position, e.g. Psammetichus I made his daughter 'wife of the god'; cf. Erman, Egypt, 295-6. If these are referred to, H. is wrong is saying (182. 2) they were unmarried. Frazer (Kingship, p. 170) considers H.'s evidence very important, as bearing on the supposed 'divine' origin of kings; he thinks the human bride was one of the 'brides of Marduk' referred to in the code of Hammurabi. *xaldai=oi. The original home of this people was on the Persian Gulf (the 'Chaldeans' of Xen. Anab. v. 5. 17 are a different tribe near Armenia, though Rawlinson, ad loc., thinks them the same); thence they pushed north, amalgamating with the earlier inhabitants. Their prince, Merodach Baladan II, ascended the throne of Babylon in 721 B.C.; the rivalry between his house and race and the priests of the older races was one of the great causes of the weakness of Babylonia (cf. 185. 1 and App. II, \u00a7 5). By a curious change of meaning, the Greeks later called the wise priestly class 'Chaldeans', and so a tribal name became a caste name (cf. 'Magi' 101 n.). For this use, which is not native, cf. Daniel (pass.), Strabo 739, &c., and for Roman times Mayor, ad Juv. x. 94. Patara lay on the coast just east of Xanthus; Apollo was at home there for the six winter months, at Delos for the rest (cf. Hor. Odes iii. 4. 64'Delius et Patareus Apollo'). So he was supposed to be away from Delphi for the three winter months. For the periodical migrations of the gods cf. Frazer, P. iii. 58. When the god was away, he naturally could not divine (cf. the irony of Elijah, 1 Kings xviii. 27). a)/galma me/ga. H. does not make it clear whether this statue is the same as the one destroyed (\u00a7 2); probably it was not. Lehmann (B. W. f\u00fcr K. P. 1900, 964 n. 6) considers that H. is here borrowing from Hecataeus (cf. 178. 2 n.); he quotes xro/non e)kei=non (\u00a7 2) in proof (but v. i.). H. here records an important fact (as Lehmann points out), though he does not understand it. The god's statue was the symbol of the independent existence of Babylon, and the king at the beginning of the year (in the month Nisan) solemnly grasped the hand of Bel-Marduk, thus acknowledging his supremacy. A conqueror by doing this conciliated the prejudices of the Babylonians, owning himself a native king. So in our earliest important Cassite inscription (before 1000 B.C.) a Cassite king records that he brought the statue of Marduk back to Babylon, and becomes 'king of Babylon' (Winckler, Der Alte O. vi, 1904, pp. 23-4). So too Cyrus, in the Cyrus Cylinder (App. IV, \u00a7 1 and R. P.2 v. 167), professes that he rules by the grace of Marduk. Xerxes, giving up this policy of conciliation, removed the statue, and so 'destroyed the personal union between Babylon and Persia'; Sennacherib had done the same, but his successors had restored the temple and statue of the god. It is to be noted that Xerxes' title changes at the same time; in 485 B.C. he is 'King of Babylon and the lands', afterwards he is 'King of Persia and Media' (Meyer, iii. 80). Apparently the change of policy was provoked by Babylonian rebellions which began at the end of the reign of Darius (so Darius is said 'to have intended' (e)pibouleu/sas) to take the statue; cf. Klio, vii. 447-8, for new inscriptions as to these rebellions). e)kei=non, 'at that time,' i.e. when Cyrus conquered Babylon. H. undoubtedly confused the kings of Babylon and Assyria (cf. 178. 1 n.). For his *)assu/rioi lo/goi cf. App. II, \u00a7 6. *semi/ramis. For this queen cf. inscriptions of 'Kalach' (B. M. G. p. 31) now in B. M. She was a Babylonian princess, the wife of the Assyrian Ramm\u00e2nnirari III (812-783 B.C.), and seems to have introduced the worship of Nebo into Nineveh; hence H. no doubt heard of her name at the Nebo temple. Her real date almost corresponds to the 'five generations' of H., i.e. 167 years before Nebuchadnezzar's accession, 605 B.C. (v. i.) = 772. It is noticeable that H. gives none of the wild Greek fables as to the mythical Semiramis (cf. Diod. ii. 5 seq., following Ctesias), which make her a sort of Assyrian Catherine II, distinguished equally in war and for sensuality. No doubt in these stories is reflected the double character of the goddess Ishtar (cf. 105. 2 n.). Berosus censures the Greeks (F. H. G. ii. 507) for saying that she founded Nineveh. For Semiramis cf. Lehmann in Klio, i. 256 seq. The xw/mata and the accompanying canals were a well-known feature of Babylonia from the time of Hammurabi (cf. App. II, \u00a7 1) onwards; they were needed at once to control the floods of the river (Strabo, 740 seq., a very interesting passage), and for the irrigation which was essential to the life of the country; it was the filling up of these canals which has turned one of the most thickly populated regions of the Old World into the waste of to-day. Their defensive use (cf. 185. 1 n.) was only secondary. The remains of thirty or forty canals are still passed in a day's journey (Nikel, p. 9). For Alexander's care of the canals cf. Strabo, 740-1. For canals in Babylonia generally cf. Winckler, Hist. of Bab. (tr. by Craig, 1907), pp. 135-9. No such queen as Nitocris is found either in the Babylonian inscriptions or in Berosus; H. perhaps misheard the name, and assimilated it, when he wrote, to the Egyptian name with which he was more familiar; Lehmann (u. s.) sees in it the consonants of the Persian form of Nebuchadnezzar, i.e. 'Nabukadracara', sounded 'tracara'. Others, however, think that it was not the ignorance of H., but his informants' prejudice (cf. 181. 5 n.) which is responsible for the suppression of all mention of this great king; they consider that in the priestly tradition the works of Nebuchadnezzar were attributed to his wife, who was a Median princess, Amuita, the daughter of Astyages (Berosus, F. H. G. ii. 505); this marriage is probably referred to i. 74. 4 n. She is said to have suggested the famous 'hanging gardens', from a longing for her Median mountain home (cf. 181. 4 n.). H. confuses her with the mother of the last king, Nabonidus ('Labynetus,' 188. 1); this lady seems from the 'annalistic tablet' to have been an important person (R. P.2 v. 160). Hence in H. the works of the great Chaldaean king are given to one composite queen. proefula/cato. This motive is probable in itself (but v. i.), and is confirmed by E. I. H. (vi. 39-56); Nebuchadnezzar knew the value of loyal alliances. He also made the great 'Median Wall', 100 feet high (Xen. Anab. i. 7. 15), from the Euphrates to the Tigris, at the point where the two rivers approached each other most nearly. H. does not mention this, probably because it did not quite reach the Euphrates (Grote, iv. 137 n.); his knowledge is mainly confined to Babylon and what he could see from the river. e)s to\\n *eu)frh/thn, the reading of all MSS., must mean that travellers from the north became involved in a labyrinth of canals at Ardericca, from which it took them three days to get clear into the Euphrates. It is usual, however, to omit e)s, in which case H. means that a traveller on the Euphrates passed the same village three times in three days; in this land of marvels he accepted this statement from some waggish fellow-traveller, who hoaxed him. H. probably travelled straight by boat from Thapsacus to Babylon (cf. Grote, u. s.), and the villages he passed were no doubt as much alike as castles on the Rhine to-day. Matzat (p. 445), however, very ingeniously tries to prove that H.'s statement is possible. The river runs thus , each bend being fourteen to eighteen miles long (+ = site of Ardericca; 1, 2, 3 = the position of the boat on three following days). He finds a confirmation of these windings in 179. 4 (q. v.), the distance of Is from Babylon. If Ardericca be a real place, it may be Idikara (cf. Ptol. v. 17. 19), about fifty miles above Sippara, where the course of the Euphrates was much diverted on account of rapids. The 'Ardericca' of vi. 119 (near Susa) is a different place. e)/lutron. The 'reservoir' (cf. iv. 173. 1) at Sippara, also the work of Nebuchadnezzar, is meant; it lay 'along, a little distance from the river'. But really it was not 'far above' Babylon; H. is either making a mistake, or he is calculating by the time spent on his journey down stream; he writes as if his boat had made the circuit of the reservoir (peri/odos, \u00a7 6), which can hardly have been the fact. Abydenus (fr. 9, F. H. G. iv. 283) makes it 40 parasangs, i.e. 1,200 stades, in circumference and 20 fathoms deep. There is no trace of this reservoir now, but an inscription of Hammurabi says, 'I set a marsh around and dug a canal and made a protecting quay' (at Sippara).' This work was renewed by the father of Nebuchadnezzar (V. Scheil, Sippara, 1902, pp. 23, 65). It was intended for irrigation (cf. the reservoir at Assuan), but no doubt could also be used to flood the country against an invader. This must be the meaning of o)/rugma pa=n e(/los (\u00a7 6), but H. has quite failed to understand his informant, and so his own account is most obscure. He seems to confuse the canals, along which his boat may well have travelled, with the great 'basin' which he only saw, and the uses of which were described to him. e)s to\\ u(/dwr, 'to the water level'; the phrase is Chaldaean (E. I. H. vii. 60). krhpi=da. Abydenus (u. s.) speaks of 'great sluice-gates' (e)xetognw/mones). H.'s account bears all the marks of an eyewitness; but possessed as he is by the Median terror, he pays no regard to the pacific use of the reservoir; hence he contradicts himself; he thinks of it as a marsh (v.s. and cf. 191. 3), but also as navigable. kata\\ tou=to. Translate 'In this way she wrought (in that part of) her country where were the entrances, and the shortest way from Media'; cf. iv. 136. 2 for ta\\ su/ntoma. The territory of Assyria was now in the Median hands (cf. for its being called 'Media' Xen. Anab. ii. 4. 27), and so the natural line of attack (e)sbolai/) would be down the right bank of the Tigris. tau=ta me/n. Translate 'These were the defences with which she surrounded (her city) by digging (e)k ba/qeos), but she took advantage of them to add such a supplementary work (parenqh/khn) as' (the river wall and bridge). Sayce (ad loc. and p. xxix) is very angry with H. for his mistake in speaking of 'huge stones' in Babylonia; but Nebuchadnezzar makes the same mistake (!) (E. I. H. ix. 24). Of course the stones were brought down the Euphrates from the north. Xenophon (Anab. i. 5. 5) speaks of a village on the Euphrates, where millstones were made for sale. Diodorus (ii. 8), who gives the bridge to Semiramis, makes it 5 stades long and 30 feet wide. These cu/la were no doubt a sort of drawbridge in the middle, pulled up on both sides; this feud (kle/ptoien) between the two river banks may be an unconscious echo of the rivalry between Babylon and her suburb, Borsippa. Lehmann (Klio, i. 259) says the inscription uses the phraseology of the royal monuments; the ou) ga\\r a)/meinon, however, is quite Greek. The presence of a dead body made the gate impassable for a Persian. Some see in the mention of 'gates' a contradiction to iii. 159. 1, but it is purely verbal (cf. 178. 2 n.). The story is a curious one; for treasures buried with the dead cf. Josephus, Ant. Jud. vii. 15. 3, pp. 392-4, who says that Solomon buried David with great treasures, and that when the tomb was robbed by Hyrcanus and by Herod, they took away great wealth, but failed to find the real royal treasure. Lehmann (W. f\u00fcr K. P. 1900, p. 962) sees in H.'s story a confusion of Darius and Xerxes (cf. iii. 150 n.); he follows Aelian (V. H. xiii. 3), who tells a similar story, with additional marvels, of Xerxes violating the tomb of Belus. But A.'s version has every mark of being an explanation of ou) ga\\r a)/meinon, and Lehmann's theory is at best only possible. Stein thinks the tale may have arisen from a misunderstood inscription. All we can say for certain is that we see in it the Babylonian hatred of their conquerors. The last king of Babylon was called Nabonidus (556 B. C.); he was no relation of Nebuchadnezzar (d. 562); between them were three kings, of whom H. knows nothing. The Choaspes is the 'river Ulai' of Daniel viii. 2. H. here gives an interesting point; the water of other lands was impure for the worshipper of Ormazd; hence the Choaspes water was taken both for drinking ('boiled') and for preparing the Haoma (cf. Indian Soma) libation (cf. vii. 54. 2 n.); for the earthly plant used for this, which corresponded to the white immortality-giving Haoma, cf. S. B. E. iv. 69. The Gyndes is the Diy\u00e2la, which runs into the Tigris from the north-east about fifty miles from Babylon; this identification is clear from v. 52. 5, where it is the next river to South. For the Matieni cf. i. 72. 2 n. and iii. 94. 1. The Dardanians are otherwise unknown. *)=wpin. H. mentions Opis because it is the highest point of navigation from the sea up the Tigris (Strabo, 739). Opis, which lay nearly fifty miles north of the Diy\u00e2la, at the junction of the Physcus and the Tigris (Xen. Anab. ii. 4. 25), was the scene of the Macedonian mutiny in 324 B. C. sumyh/sas: literally 'rub together', and so 'obliterate'. Here = e. his army. 'He extended it.' Maspero (iii. 635) accepts the story as partly true; Cyrus, he thinks, with the main army turned the defensive works on the north of Babylon, by lowering the water in the Tigris and the Gyndes. (Cf. Caes. B. C. i. 61 for a similar operation on the Sicoris in 49 B. C.) There was one battle (R. P. v2. 162) near Opis, as H. says (190. 1), and it was immediately followed by a revolt in Akkad (i. e. N. Babylonia). Meantime Gobryas, marching down the left bank of the Gyndes with a portion of the army, took Babylon by treachery, while the main defensive force was resisting Cyrus. In the same way Pr\u00e1ek (i. 229) accepts the story of c. 191 as describing the preparations to intimidate the capital, and force a capitulation. Even if these views be correct, the story told to H. was completely misleading; the city was taken by treachery (App. IV, \u00a7 6). But it is more likely that H. is partly right (as thus suggested) than that the whole narrative is an invention borrowed from the irrigation works on the Gyndes (as Sir H. Rawlinson, ad loc.). The form it takes is religious in colouring; 'white horses' were sacred to the sun (iii. 90. 3 n.; cf. vii. 40. 4); hence the offending river is divided into as many channels (360) as there are days in the year. The war lasted longer than H. thinks; it perhaps began in 546 B. C., as the annals of Nabonidus seem to speak of an attack on Akkad (i. e. N. Babylonia) from Elam in that year (R. P. v2. 161); but the record is much mutilated. proesa/canto. The use of this word in viii. 20. 1 seems to show that it is from prosa/ttw, 'they packed up beforehand,' not from proesa/gw (as Schweigh\u00e4user); cf. v. 34. 1 n. a(/pasan. Used loosely for 'the main army', as two other contingents are at once mentioned. e(/los. Cf. 185. 4, 5 nn. u(ponosth/santos, 'when the river had sunk' (cf. iv. 62. 2). For Aristotle's account of the capture of Babylon, which even exaggerates the one here, cf. 178. 2 n. o(rth/n. The 'feast' agrees with the well-known story in Dan. v. prw=ton. H. calls it 'the first' capture, in contrast to that by Darius (iii. 158). No doubt, however, he heard in Babylon nothing of Assyrian captures, e.g. by Assurbanipal in 648 B. C. The account of the Babylonian land and people. trofh/n. This general payment in kind is not mentioned in iii. 90-5; the only corn contribution there (91. 3) is that of Egypt. The omission of the corn-tax in Bk. III goes to show (what is antecedently probable) that H. is there quoting an official document, drawn up for one special purpose, not giving an account of the whole revenue system. The corn contribution here mentioned corresponds to the Roman (1) frumentum in cellam (for the governor and his suite); but this was paid for; (2) annona militaris (for the soldiers in the province); (3) annona civica, i. e. for Rome, from Egypt and Africa (Marquardt, Staats-V. ii. 189, 232-3). For contributions in kind in Persia cf. Theop. frs. 124-5 (F. H. G. i. 298) and Meyer, iii. 51. For the use of *)assuri/h cf. 178. 1 n. For satraphi/hn cf. iii. 89. 1 n. This Tritantaechmes, who was clearly satrap of Babylon when H. was there, is to be distinguished from the nephew of Darius (vii. 82); for his father Artabazus cf. viii. 126 and ix. pass. As the me/dimnos held 48 xoi/nikes, the 'artaba' held 51, i. e. about 13 gallons. *a xoi=nic of wheat was a man's daily allowance, vii. 187. 2. For its size cf. vi. 57 n. For the hunting dogs see Rawlinson, ad loc. (with illustration). Ctesias (Ind. 5, p. 248) says they were able to cope with a lion, a characteristic exaggeration. M. Polo (ii. 19; i. 400) says the Great Khan had about 10,000 hunting dogs. H. is describing the Babylonian plain proper, i. e. the southern part of Mesopotamia; at the present time the Euphrates and the Tigris unite in the Shat-El-Arab, but originally they reached the sea separately. u(/etai. Rain, which is abundant in Assyria proper, falls in Babylonia chiefly in the winter and spring, and then as a rule not in large quantities. Willcocks' table (Irrigation of Mesopotamia, 1910, p. 68) shows that from May to October the land is practically rainless, in the other six months the rainfall is about eight inches, fairly evenly distributed. So far as rain is concerned the country is not a desert like Egypt, but rather a 'steppe region capable of sustaining millions of sheep' (p. 10). Grote (iii. 295) lays stress on the accuracy of H. in contrasting the light rains here with practically rainless Upper Egypt (iii. 10 n.). H. is quite right in saying that while the scanty spring rain (tou=to) 'causes the corn to sprout, the crop ripens from irrigation'. His description of this is accurate, if we remember that he is contrasting the natural (au)tou= tou= potamou=) Nile flood with the artificial Babylonian system. The present Euphrates, however, now that the canals are gone, floods its banks from March to July, when the Armenian snows melt. khlwnhi/oisi, 'by swipes worked by hand' (cf. vi. 119. 3), i. e. the shadoufs which are still used in Mesopotamia and Egypt (cf. Maspero, i. 764, and 340 for illustrations). Colonel Chesney (Survey of Tig. and Euph. 1850, ii. 653) describes it as a wooden lever, 13-15 feet long, revolving on a post 3-4 feet high with a bucket at the end, balanced when full by a weight at the other end. From the top of the bank the water was distributed over the fields in artificial channels. For the canals cf. c. 184 n. The canal here is the 'royal canal' restored by Nebuchadnezzar, which ran south-east from above Babylon to the Tigris, near the later Seleucia. pro\\s h(/lion to\\n xeimerino/n. The ancients divided the sky into dusmh\\ i)shmerinh/ = E. and W.a)natolh/ = NE. and NW.a)natolh/ and dusmh\\ xeimerinh/ = SE. and SW. (cf. Arist. Meteor. ii. 6 ad init., where a diagram is given). Here h(/lios = a)natolh/ (cf. vii. 70. 1 oi( a)po\\ h(li/ou *ai)qi/opes). H. is contrasting broadly and rightly the treeless cornland of Babylonia with Greece. Strabo (742 pp. 305 seq.) argues that the accounts of H. and of Strabo are borrowed independently from Hecataeus (cf. c. 199 n.). His arrangement of the two accounts in parallel columns is useful, though his argument quite breaks down. fu/lla, 'blades.' Ancient (e. g. Theophrastus, viii. 7. 4) and modern writers confirm H. as to the fertility of Babylonia; so Chesney (ii. 602) says 'those portions which are still cultivated, as round Hillah, show that the region has all the fertility ascribed to it by H.' An inscription of Assurbanipal claims, with perhaps pardonable exaggeration, that grain grew five cubits high, and that the heads were five-sixths of a cubit (Winckler, Hist. of e)xo/mena, various kinds of corn already mentioned'; the perfect a)pi=ktai has been thought to refer to a previous description by Hecataeus (v. s.). It is, however, only a picturesque anticipation of criticism; cf. Matzat, pp. 438-9. ii. 423) confirms this; cf. Xen. Anab. iv. 4. 13 for this and other substitutes for olive oil (in Armenia). It was made from the 'sesame' seed. foi/nikes. H. is quite right as to their abundance. karpofo/roi marks the contrast to those in the Aegean regions, which do not ripen their fruits. Cf. Theop. Hist. Plant. iii. 3. 5. Dates were a main article of food in Babylonia; for the manifold uses of the palm-tree cf. Strabo 742, who says they were 360 in number, and E. B.11 xx. 642 s. v. H. here rightly describes the process of fertilization of figs, e)rinasmo/s (Theop. H. P. ii. 8. 1; cf. also Arist. H. A. v. 32). The caprificus or wild fig produces inedible figs which are inhabited by the fig-wasp; the female wasps, hatched in these figs, make their way from them, laden with pollen, to the young figs of the ficus or fig proper, in order to lay their eggs in them; they pollinate their flowers, and thus fertilization is effected. H. wrongly thinks the purpose of the process was to prevent the fig falling off. He is wrong, too, in transferring the process to palm-trees; fertilization in these is rightly described by Theop. (u. s. ii. however, gives the object wrongly, i. e. to prevent the falling off of the fruit. The process is represented on the monuments (cf. B. M. G. 36, and Maspero, i. 555, for picture). H. obscures his meaning by using different words ba/lanos and karpo/s for the same thing, and wrongly substituting o)/lunqoi, 'the untimely figs,' for e)rineoi/, i. e. fici caprifici. H. is always interested in means of navigation (cf. ii. 96). These round skin-covered boats (k\u00fafah) are still used on the Lower Euphrates, but not of the size described here; the largest, however, can still carry a camel (cf. for their construction the British coracles, for a full description, Chesney, ii. 639 seq., and for a picture, Maspero, i. 542). H. does not mention the rafts on skin-bladders, which are now more used on the Upper Euphrates. Both kinds are alike in sailing down stream only, and in being broken up and sold (all but the skins, v. i.) when the voyage is over. The rafts are always, the k\u00fafahs only usually, broken up. H. omits to mention that the boats are usually smeared with bitumen. ou)/te pru/mnhn: the usual processes in shipbuilding, 'distinguishing (a)pokri/nontes) the stern and narrowing the prow,' are not used. kala/mhs, 'straw,' not for packing, but for stuffing in the interstices of the ribs (nome/as). foinikhi/ous. It is the casks that are of palm-wood; grape wine was imported (cf. 193. 3), but Babylonia had plenty of palm-wine (193. 4). The two men stood facing each other; but in the picture (u. s. there are four men, sitting in pairs opposite each other. We may cf. with H.'s account, the lightermen on the Thames, one of whom pulls (e)/sw) while the other backs (e)/cw); the object was to guide the boat, which was carried by the current. For other explanations cf. Macaulay, ad loc. kai/, 'quite five thousand.' This would give a burden (go/mos) of about 125 or 175 tons, according as the Attic or Aeginetan talent is taken. a)p' w)=n e)kh/rucan. This form of tmesis is common in H. (but always with aorist) in describing customs, &c. Cf. ii. 39. 2 et pass. H. gives five pieces of Babylonian dress: (1) The tunic reaching to the feet; this was frequently flounced and fringed (cf. picture in Maspero, iii. 546). The warlike Assyrians wore it shorter. (2) The upper woollen tunic; this is often concealed by (3). (3) The white cloak thrown round the shoulders. (4) The open shoes. For the 'Boeotian shoes' cf. Dicaearchus, Perieg. 19 (G. G. M. i. 103), who says they were u(sklwto/s ('with an edge laced over the foot', L. & S.), 'so as to leave the feet almost bare.' The Babylonians, however, generally went barefoot. (5) The high cap; v. s. or Rawlinson, ad loc., for pictures. H. is right as to their long hair and their fondness for cosmetics. sfrhgi=da. The 'seals' are the well-known Babylonian cylinders which were so used (cf. B. M. G. 156 seq. with pictures). The Babylonians frequently (but not always) are shown carrying staves; the heads of these are often elaborately wrought. Information as to the Veneti (distinguished as oi( e)n tw=| *)adri/h|, v. 9. 2) must have reached H. in Italy. e)poie/eto. H. uses the past tense, as the custom was discontinuea (v. i.). Strabo (745), however [so too Nic. Dam. fr. 131, F. H. G. iii. 462; and Ael. V. H. iv. 1], uses the present, copying H. loosely. The Babylonian contracts speak of the sale of brides, but no trace is found of this fixed custom. For marriage by purchase cf. Westermarck, pp. 391-5. sunoikh/si. They were sold 'for marriage', not for slavery. a)pofe/rein: i. e. the poorer classes of buyers might 'return' bride and dowry together. The decay of prosperity in Babylon may well be partially the cause of the fact that the collection of 2,500 private contracts in the B. M. does not extend beyond the reign of Darius I (Meyer, iii. 81). For its supposed result here cf. the Lydian custom, 94. 1. The connexion of ideas in H.'s mind seems to be that sickness suggests death, and death suggests the beginnings of life. Lehmann, however (cf. 193. 3 n.), says Strabo preserves the order of the original ('Hecataeus'), putting together the various kinds of impurity (from the dead and from sexual intercourse, 745). But S. is even more confused than H., for he interpolates (746) his account of 'dress' between his accounts of sickness and of death. For the ideas of the Babylonians as to death and for their burial rites cf. Maspero, i. 683 seq. For the use of honey as a preservative against corruption cf. 140. 2 (the use of wax in Persia); Lehmann says (u. s., p. 314) that in the same way the bodies of dead Shiite Mahometans are sent to Kerbela, covered with saffron. For a similar use of honey in prehistoric Greece cf. Busolt, i. 66 seq.; cf. also vi. 58. 3 n. For the Egyptian qrh=noi cf. ii. 79 n. H. is obviously writing as an eyewitness, and his account is of great value anthropologically; but he is mistaken in making universal one single set of rites, those of the goddess Nana at Erech. He may also be confusing the i(ero/douloi attached to the temple (v. i.i(ro\\n to\\ a)rgu/rion) with the ordinary worshippers. For the custom cf. Strabo (745), who inaccurately condenses H. and adds kata/ ti lo/gion, and Baruch vi. 43. Lucian describes the same custom from personal inquiry, but as an exception, in speaking of the Adonis worship (De Dea Syria, p. 454, c. 6); women there could escape the rite by cutting off their hair. For other instances cf. 94 n.; W. Robertson Smith, Kinship2 &c. p. 297; Westermarck, p. 72 (who thinks the custom not a survival of communal marriage but connected with phallic worship as a late development); and especially E. S. Hartland (Essays presented to E. B. Tylor, 1907, pp. 187-202), who considers the custom a 'puberty rite', belonging to a primitive stage of ideas, and only connected later with the worship of Mylitta; he quotes many parallels among modern savages. Women as a rule in Babylon had a position which, for a Semitic people, was high; the system of dowry, paid to the parents and secured to the wife (cf. 196. 4), gradually emancipated her; she could hold property and make contracts. qw/miggos. The 'cord' is a symbol of their service due to the goddess. For Mylitta cf. 131. 3 n. a)posiwsame/nh, 'having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess' (cf. iv. 154. 4). For Aphrodite in Cyprus cf. 105. 2 and Hor. Odes i. 3. 1. Justin (xviii. 5) speaks of this custom there, when telling the story of Dido. patriai/, 'clans.' H. refers to the dwellers in the marshy regions along the lower course of the rivers and on the Persian Gulf. Diodorus (iii. 22) gives an interesting account of the methods of fish-catching there. H. exaggerates their fish diet. For the pounding of dried fish 'with pestles' (u(pe/roisi) in a mortar (o)/lmon) cf. iv. 172. 1. The ma=za is a soft cake, softened with water, the a)/rtos (a superior form) was baked. For the Araxes, i. e. the Jaxartes or Syr-Daria, v. i. a)nti/on: a primitive attempt to express longitude; the expression *)isshdo/nes a)/ndres is poetic; H. is perhaps borrowing from the *)arima/spea of Aristeas (iv. 13 n.). For *skuqiko/n cf. App. XI; for the Issedones, iv. 26. H.'s account of the Araxes is a characteristic specimen of his geographical knowledge (and ignorance). He mentions it (1) here, where it rises among the Matieni (cf. 72. 2 n.) and (a) falls with one mouth into the Caspian, (b) loses thirty-nine others in marshes; (2) in iv. 40. 1, flowing east, it forms with the Caspian the north boundary of his Asia; (3) iv. 11. 1 the Scythians are driven across it by the Massagetae into Cimmeria. He is combining four rivers: No. 1 (a) is the Aras, which unites with the Kur and flows into the S.W. Caspian; in H.'s day the Aras flowed into the Caspian direct (Hermes, 1884, p. 169); No. 2, and perhaps No. 1 (b), are a confused account of the two great rivers of Central Asia, the Oxus and the Jaxartes, which flow north-west into the Aral Sea; probably at this period the Oxus also flowed into the Caspian. H. has inverted their direction and combined them, misled by his information (right in itself) that some of the rivers of Central Asia lose themselves in swamps (cf. E. B.11 ii. 735). The East of the world was to H. unknown sandy desert (iii. 98. 2). No. 3 is the Volga. It is quite possible that the 'marshes and shoals' may be a confused account of the great Volga delta, and not of the Central Asian rivers, as suggested above. The name Araxes probably survives in 'Aroxolani' (Jornandes, c. 74), i.e. 'the of the Araxes'. 'Rha,' Ptolemy's name for the Volga (v. 9), is probably a different word. H.'s confusion may be pardoned when we find Aristotle (350 A, Meteor. i. 13. 15) making the Tanais a branch of the Araxes (which he rightly makes to rise in Mount Paropamisus). So Alexander and his army thought the Jaxartes to be the Tanais (Plin. N. H. vi. 16. 49); Arrian (iii. 30. 7, 8) corrects this mistake, but makes the Jaxartes rise in the Caucasus. Even in our own day the head-waters of the Congo were thought by Livingstone to be the source of the Nile (cf. ii. 33. 1. n.). th=| o)dmh=|. For this primitive form of smoking cf. iv. 75, the vapour baths of the Scythians. Probably some kind of hemp is meant; the Cannabis sativa is indigenous in Central Asia; hashish is still prepared from Cannabis indica. H., in making the Araxes rise in the same region as the Gyndes, is (quite needlessly) supposed to be misled by a forced analogy between the many mouths of the Araxes and the canalization of the Gyndes; these rivers, though at their nearest point 250 miles apart, and at their sources much more, both do rise in the watershed between Mesopotamia and the Caspian basin. The number 'forty' probably is a round number meaning 'very many'; so 'Kyrk' (= forty) is used in Turkish. We may compare without irreverence the 'forty' of the O. T. (Gen. viii. 6 et pass.). H.'s knowledge of the Caspian is one of his geographical triumphs; subsequent writers, except Aristotle, to the time of Ptolemy (second century A. D.) thought that it was a gulf of the Northern Sea, as the Persian Gulf is of the Southern; Alexander (Arr. Anab. vii. 16. 2) was preparing to test this theory when he died. Even after Ptolemy mediaeval cartographers returned to the old blunder (Tozer, A. G. p. 367). mi/a e)ou=sa. This was known since Necho's circumnavigation of Africa (iv. 42). The name 'Atlantic' occurs first here, but was obviously already familiar. For the 'pillars of Hercules' cf. ii. 33. 3 n. In ii. 11. 2 the Red Sea is forty days by 'rowing'; if we assume that H. knew the real length of that sea, i.e. 1,200 miles, we have an average of thirty miles a day. Hence his figures here are too small, at any rate for length; for the Caspian is about 750 miles long and 280 wide. u(yhlo/taton. Aristotle (350 A, Meteor. i. 13. 15) limits this by saying the Caucasus is the highest of the mountains of the East; both he and H. were ignorant of Mount Demavend, which rises to the south of the Caspian, 3,000 feet higher than the Caucasus (to over 20,000 feet). e)mfane/a. Cf. Xenophon (Anab. v. 4. 33, an eyewitness), who records this lowest stage of degradation among the Mossynoeci (cf. iii. 94. 2), at the south-east corner of the Caspian (cf. Apoll. Rhod. ii. 1025); Theopompus (fr. 222; F. H. G. i. 315) relates it also of the Etruscans. But among modern savages it is, to say the least, very rare (Crawley, Mystic Rose, p. 180). a)/peiron. H. well describes the great plains of N.W. Asia. For towers at a bridge-head as a protection cf. Caes. B. G. vi. 29. paqh/mata. For the antithesis cf. Aesch. Agam. 177. Croesus, by a dramatic irony, gives fatal advice to his patron, just as Adrastus (c. 35 seq.) unwillingly had returned evil for good to himself. The possibility of disaster is euphemistically expressed, to avoid words of evil omen. e)kei/nw|, 'the course above,' i.e. the advance of the explained . *tomu/rios, i.e. both Cyrus and his enemies would use their victory to the full. The stratagem is related by Polyaenus (Strat. viii. 28) of Tomyris, queen of 'the Amazons,' against Cyrus; this version is equally appropriate and equally unhistorical with that of H. e)di/dou, imperfect, 'he proposed to give.' Cf. for the Persian custom vii. 2. 1, the appointment of Xerxes as successor. For the genealogy of Darius cf. App. IV. 3. For the wings cf. the figure on the tomb at Murghab (125. 3 n.). For the primitive belief that a man was responsible for acts done in dreamland cf. Tylor, P. C. i. 438 seq.; the soul was supposed to go abroad in sleep or trance; cf. the old belief that it was unlucky to turn a sleeper over for fear the soul should not find its way back. Here it is combined with the later and more general belief that dreams foretell the future. For a somewhat similar combination cf. 'the dreams' of Joseph (Gen. xxxvii. 5 seq.). Spargapises recurs (iv. 76. 6) as Spargapithes, the name of a Scythian king; it is perhaps of Aryan derivation. Other authorities give Cyrus thirty years, e.g. Ctesias (8, p. 66), Justin (i. 8), Dinon (fr. 10, F. H. G. ii. 91). H.'s exact figure is more probable; Cyrus therefore began to reign in 558 B. C. For a similar outrage on the dead cf. the treatment of Crassus' head after Carrhae (Dio Cass. xl. 27 the pouring in of molten gold). Sir H. Rawlinson thinks the sa/garis = the khanjar of modern Persia, a short curved double-edged dagger; but in vii. 64. 2 it is explained by a)ci/nh; it must therefore be a weapon for hacking, not thrusting, probably like the Gurkha 'kukri'. Gold is abundant both in the Ural and the Altai Mountains (cf. iv. 26 n.). The Massagetae were still in the Bronze Age. gunai=ka. Strabo (513) simply repeats H.; for a similar custom among the Agathyrsi cf. iv. 104; among the Nasamones, iv. 172. 2 n.; M. Polo (ii. 47; ii. 54, 56) found it in Caindu (i.e. Yunnan), where 'a hat' was hung up as a sign that a stranger was in possession. For its bearing on the theory of communal marriage cf. Westermarck, p. 72 seq. There is clear evidence for a system of marriage among the Massagetae, but they were polyandrous, ib. 454 seq. Myres (A. and C. p. 155) says: 'It can hardly be accident that every one of the strange marriage customs which H. mentions happens to be typical of a widespread type.' th=s ga\\r e)piqumh/sh|.

Pharnaspes was an Achaemenid, though not of the direct royal line; it was usual for Persian kings to marry members of their own family (e.g. Darius and Atossa, daughter of Cyrus). H. lays stress on the name and lineage of the mother of Cambyses, because the Egyptians made him the son of an Egyptian princess (iii. 1 n.). The mention of Ionians connects this book with i. 141-76; cf. the mention of Amasis (iii. 1), which links together Bks. II and III. H.'s custom is to give some account of the manners and the past history of each new people, as he brings it on the stage of his history; but this account of Egypt, even more than that of Scythia in Bk. IV, is out of all proportion to the rest of his history. Hence the idea that it was composed separately, probably after the rest, and only later incorporated in his general scheme (cf. Introd. \u00a7 11). That the Egyptians were the oldest race in the world was a general belief; cf. Arist. Pol. vii. 10. 8, 1329 b, and Diod. i. 101, who says the Nile, polu/gonos w)/n, was a special cause of the priority of the Egyptians. Antiquity and nobility of race were supposed to go together. e)pitexna=tai.

The be more usual; but cf. a)kmh/n, kairo/n. ka)maqousi/wn e.g. in Aristoph. Nub. 398 bekkese/lhne (cf. i. 4. 2 n.). Even in ancient times the word beko/s was explained as onomatopoetic, from the cries of the goats. Ramsay has recently found it on a Phrygian inscription (Jahreshefte des \u00d6st. Arch. Inst. in Wien, 1905, Beibl. p. 95 seq.). The Phrygians were generally considered a recent people; cf. vii. 73 for their immigration from Europe. The Egyptians certainly attached great importance to the cries of children; but H.'s story sounds like a Greek invention, a protest against the Egyptian claim to priority, which he elsewhere accepts. The Egyptians could have claimed beko/s as evidence for their own antiquity, for it resembles one of their words for 'oil'. *(hfai/stou: i.e. Ptah; cf. iii. 37. 2 n. One of the sacred names for Memphis was Het-Ka-Ptah, i.e. 'temple of the Ka (i.e. the \"double\") of Ptah', from which name some have derived *ai)/guptos. 'Memphis' (= Mennefert, the good place) was only the profane name of the city. For the temple's importance as a source of H.'s information cf. App. X, \u00a7 10, and Introd. \u00a7 24. ma/taia: this is perhaps a hit at Hecataeus; for H.'s critical attitude to his countrymen cf. c. 45 nn. Bury (A. G. H. p. 51) thinks H. would have written *)/iwnes, had he meant to criticize Hecataeus, and that he really is here borrowing a point from that writer. But there is no evidence for the borrowing, and it is not likely in itself. It has been argued that this second version is the original form of the story, which H., as a philo-Egyptian, has softened down; on the other hand, the more brutal story may well be only an attempt to rationalize the older legend. Memphis, Heliopolis, and Thebes represent the three chief forms of the older Egyptian worship, i.e. of Ptah at Memphis, of Atum or Tumu (the Sun) at Heliopolis, and Amen-Ra at Thebes. Memphis perhaps was founded by Merpeba, the sixth king of the First Dynasty, who was combined with Mena the first king (King and Hall, pp. 91-3). Its age was proverbial in Egypt. Even when, under the 'new Kingdom', Thebes became the capital, M. was a second capital. Its ruins were largely used for building Cairo, about fourteen miles to the south of which town it lies, on the left bank of the Nile, under the rubbish heaps of Bedrashn. Thebes. The usual Egyptian name of the town was Nu, 'the town' i.e. of Amen-Ra (cf. Hebrew No, Jer. xlvi. 25, and NoAmon, Nahum iii. 8); the Greek name is from the less common Apet. Thebes first became a royal residence under the eleventh Dynasty. It remained important till the seventh century B.C., when it was sacked by the Assyrians; from this it never recovered. Its most important temple was that of Amen-Ra at Karnak; H. (c. 143 nn.) calls it a temple of Zeus. Heliopolis. Its sacred name was House of Ra, i.e. the Sun-God; it is the Hebrew On. Its ruins are near Matarieh, which is six miles NNE. of Cairo, and about four miles E. of the Nile; when H. speaks (9. 1) of the a)na/ploos from Heliopolis to Thebes, he is writing loosely. Heliopolis was important as a religious, and not as a political, centre. H. rightly speaks of its inhabitants as 'most skilled in tradition' (logiw/tatoi); from it were said to have come the teachers of Pythagoras, Solon, and Plato. Strabo (806) describes it as a seat of learning, though in his day it was only a show-place. qei=a are contrasted with a)nqrwph/ia (4. 1); for similar scruples cf. c. pass. i)/son . . . e)pi/stasqai. The meaning of these words has been much disputed. (1) It is clear that au)tw=n refers to divine things, not merely to the divine names (as B\u00e4hr); H. did not think all men knew equally the names of the gods. (2) Wiedemann's explanation, too, must be rejected. He argues that H. means that, since all men agree as to the gods, it is only necessary to mention their names (which differ in different races), and then men will understand each other. But this statement again is not true; H. does not think all men's knowledge of divine things is equal; on the contrary, he thinks Greek knowledge much inferior to that in Egypt (cf. e.g. 43. 2 as to Heracles). (3) The usual explanation (e.g. Stein's) is that i)/son = just as much, i.e. 'just as little'; since men really know nothing of divine things (cf. ix. 65) they should not laugh at each other's beliefs. This pessimistic view would be quite in accordance with H.'s general attitude (cf. Introd. \u00a7 36), and may be compared to Xenophanes' sentiment (fr. 14, R. and P. p. 80) ou)de/ tise)/stai ei)dw\\s a)mfi\\ qew=n. (4) But this explanation does not take account of the character of the passages where H. lays stress on his silence (v.i.); in view of these Sourdille (R. pp. 2-26), who discusses the whole subject at length, maintains that the reference is to the 'mysteries'. Since these, H. thinks, are virtually the same in all countries (cf. 81. 2, 123. 2, 3), to describe the Egyptian mysteries would be to reveal the secrets of the Greek ones. Hence H. is careful only to touch on them (cf. 65. 2 au)tw=n e)piyau/sas, a)nagkai/h| katalambano/menos); he will describe details, but not relate the i(ro\\s lo/gos which explained them. The following are the passages in Bk. II where H. is religiously silent: 46. 2 (the goat-footed Pan), 47. 2 (the sacrifice of swine), 61. 1, 132. 2 (the sacred mourning at Busiris), 65. 2 (animal worship, the most important passage), 86. 2 (embalming), 170. 1 (the tomb of Osiris at Sais), (the phallic ceremonies for Dionysus), 51. 4 (the Samothracian Hermes), 62. 2 (the feasts of lights at Sais), 81.2 (wearing wool), though he refuses to tell a i(ro\\s lo/gos, he does not especially refer to his silence. It will be noticed (vid. nn.) that most of these passages refer to Osiris. to\\n e)niauto/n. I. The Problem of the Calendar. The difficulty of all calendars is to reconcile a lunar and a solar system of reckoning; by the former the year consists of 354 days, by the latter of about 365 1/4. (The exact figures are: days hours min. sec. a lunation ... ... ... ... 29 12 44 3 a lunar year ... ... ... 354 8 48 36 a solar year ... ... ... 365 5 48 48.) The calendar had to be regulated (1) in order to secure the proper recurrence of feasts (hence month-names are often taken from festivals; cf. Curtius, G. H. ii. 23 f. for the connexion of Delphi and the calendar). (2) To regulate civil procedure. Two problems arise: (a) to adjust the civil month to the motions of the moon; (b to adjust the lunar month and the solar year. II. Greek Solutions. The Greeks adopted a lunar reckoning, making the months alternately of 30 and 29 days; this was arranged by Solon (cf. Plut. Sol. 25, and L. and S. s. v.e(/nos). It is said that he tried further to rectify the error thus arising from the shortness of his year (which was only 30 x 6 + 29 x 6 = 354 days), by inserting an intercalary month every other year (dia\\ tri/tou e)/teos, for which phrase cf. 37. 2 dia\\ tri/ths h(me/rhs, and iii. 97. 3). H. here and in i. 32. 3 definitely asserts that this was the Greek system in his day. Others, however (e.g. Stein), argue that H. has misunderstood the system; an intercalary month every other year would give 738 days in two years, instead of 730 1/2. Hence they argue that the real system in H.'s time was to introduce three (not four, as H.) intercalary months in every period of eight years; this would give a fairly accurate result, i.e. 354 x 8 + 90 = 2922 = 8 x 365 1/4. This seems really to have been the arrangement in H.'s own day; but the date of its introduction is uncertain. Unger argues (I. M\u00fcller, Handb. der klass. Alt.-Wiss. i. 569-70) that the eight-year period existed from quite early times, at any rate from the eighth century, as is shown by myths and customs (Plut. Mor. 418), and (presumably) that the three intercalary months in each period are also early; Solon may have used this system. The calendar was further adjusted by Meton in Periclean times, who introduced a nineteen-years' cycle. For a brief account of the whole subject cf. Abbott, Outlines of Gk. Hist. pp. 10 seq. III. Egyptian Solutions. The Egyptians were the first people who definitely adopted a solar year of twelve months with thirty days in each; this began July 19 (according to the Julian calendar), i.e. 1st of Thoth according to the Egyptian, which was about a month in advance of the real solar year. On this day Sirius (Sothis) is first visible in the morning, in the latitude of Memphis (cf. a)/strwn). This coincides with the beginning of the rise of the Nile (19. 2 n.). Five days were added (e)pago/menai) at the end of the year. So far H. is right; but he quite fails to grasp the methods by which the Egyptians tried to reconcile this year of 365 days with the real solar year of 365 1/4 days (roughly) (cf. o( ku/klos . . . e)s tw)uto\\ paragi/netai). This is not surprising, as scholars are not agreed even now as to their methods. Brugsch says they had anticipated the Julian calendar, and to every fourth year added an extra day, i.e. making it a leap year. Certainly J. Caesar was said to have derived his calendar from Egypt (Dio Cass. xliii. 26). This view seems to be a mistake. Ptolemy Euergetes (238 B.C.), by the decree of Canopus, tried to introduce this (i.e. the Julian) system, but in vain. The Egyptians, however, recognized that their common year and the real year (the 'Sothic year') did not agree, and that the 'common year' grew later and later; hence the calculation of 1,460 years (= 1,461 'common years'), at the expiration of which the mistake had rectified itself (1/4 day per year for 1,460 years = a year of 365 days). The first 'Sothic period' is said to begin 4241 B.C. (but cf. App. X, \u00a7 2). Hence the date of the arrangement of the calendar is fixed for this year, 'the first certain date in the world's history' (Meyer, i, \u00a7\u00a7 159, 195-7). Cf. also B. M. G. pp. 182 seq. for a short but clear account of the Egyptian calendar. The five 'extra days' can be traced on the monuments as far back as the 6th Dynasty. duw/deka qew=n. For the Egyptian Pantheon in H. cf. c. 145 nn. Here he only means that the names of the twelve chief gods of the Greek Pantheon were Egyptian (c. 52). For the pictures of the Egyptian gods cf. B. M. G. pp. 123 seq. zw=|a (cf. i. 70. 1 n.); not the hieroglyphs (which the Greeks did not borrow), but 'figures' of animals, men, plants, &c., e.g. on the scarab, worn as amulets; these were largely exported to Greece. *mi=na: cf. c. 99 n. *qhbai+kou= nomou= = the southern part of Upper Egypt, the later Thebais. H. is not consistent here with his own statement (c. 99) that Menes founded Memphis; that town lies some way 'below' (e)/nerqe), i.e. north of, L. Moeris (for which cf. c. 149 n.). The legend also is exaggerated; but 'it contains the truth that Lower Egypt remained a land of swamps far later than Upper Egypt' (Erman, E. p. 16). For nomou= cf. 164 n. The origin (5, 10-14), dimensions (6-9), and boundaries of Egypt (15-18). dh=la ga\\r dh/. This passage naturally means 'I should have seen this for myself, even if I had not been told'. The phrase dw=ron t. p., however, is attributed by Arrian (Anab. v. 6\u2014doubtfully) to Hecataeus; hence some see in it a proof that H. used the work of his predecessor as a guide-book; but cf. Introd. \u00a7 20. The Greeks were quick to observe the action of rivers in forming deltas; cf. c. 10 and Thuc. ii. 102. H. is quite right that Egypt is alluvial deposit; this is true of the whole country up to the first cataract; but the process of silting up had taken far longer than he supposes (e.g. some place it at 74,000 years). The elevation of the ground is now very slow\u2014only four inches in one hundred years. e)s th/n. The words mark off one part of the Delta. ta\\ katu/perqe . . . plo/ou. This clause roughly parallel to e)s th\\n *(/ellhnes n.; it marks off a second part of the country which is also 'a gift of the river'. The construction is adverbial.

H. calls a day's plou=s 540 (9. 1) or 700 stades (iv. 86); either of these figures is far too much here; a depth of eleven fathoms is reached some twelve or fifteen miles from the coast near Aboukir. Both facts in \u00a7 2 are quoted to show the effect of the Nile on the coast, viz. the presence of alluvial mud and the small depth of water. mh=kos. H. (in c. 7. 1 and c. 10) continues his proof that Egypt is alluvial, but digresses here to give its dimensions. sxoi=noi. Properly a 'rope', cp. Eng. 'cord' and 'chain' as measures. The extent of a sxoi=nos was uncertain, probably because it was a practical measure, not strictly a measure of length (cp. Germ. 'Stunde'). Strabo (804) says that it varied from 30 to 120 stades. H. gives it a uniform value of 60 stades, and so is inaccurate in his results; here he exaggerates, and makes Egypt, which has really only about 2200 stades of sea-coast, to have '3600'. It is noticeable that '60 stades' was the estimate of a sxoi=nos from Thebes to Syene (Artemidorus in Strabo, 804), which confirms H.'s statement that he had been south of Thebes (29 nn.). Lehmann (W. K. P. 1895, pp. 180-2), however, explains more elaborately H.'s errors here and in cc. 9, 149. He argues (1) that the sxoi=nos = the parasang = 30 stades; (2) that H. has taken the figures from his source\u2014probably Hecataeus\u2014and has wrongly doubled the size of the sxoi=nos; (3) that perhaps this mistake is due to the confusion of the smaller and the larger 'kaspu'\u2014Babylonian measures of one and of two parasangs respectively. His proof may be given in the following table: H. H. corrected. Reality as crow flies. Breadth of Egypt 3,600 st. 1,800 st. = 357.1 km. 355-360 km. From Thebes to Elephantine ... 1,800 ,, 900 ,, = 3,600 ,, 1,800 ,, Pliny v. 50, 2,000 st. It is not certain, however, that measurements 'as the crow flies' were made before Eratosthenes (circ. 230 B.C.), and the fact that in Egyptian land measurement 'all angles were treated as though they were right angles' (Lyons, Survey, p. 48) does not inspire confidence; there is no evidence that Hecataeus or any other Greek before H. had attempted to give measures for Egypt. H. certainly seems to speak in c. 9 as if he were measuring along the river. tou= *plinqinh/tew. Plinthine lay near the later Alexandria, on the Mareotic Lake; H. (18. 2) mentions Marea as one of the border towns towards Libya. *serbwni/dos. This lake (now dry) lay parallel to the sea on the east side of Egypt (cf. iii. 5. 3 n.). It was much feared for its swampy shores, which were said to be covered with drifted sand, and so to engulf the unwary (cf. Diod. i. 30; Milton, Paradise Lost, ii. 592-4): A gulf profound as that Serbonian bogBetwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,Where armies whole have sunk. The army of Darius Ochus in 350 B.C. was said to have perished thus. It lay under Mount Casius, the real boundary of Egypt and Syria (158. 4); this was a sand dune of no great height, the modern R\u00e2s el Kasr\u00fbn, crowned with a temple to Baal (cf. the Baal-Zephon of Exodus xiv. 2, 9); Pompey was killed at its foot. Parasang (cf. v. 53 n.) in H. and Xenophon = 30 stades = 4 Roman miles; thus it corresponds to modern Persian 'farsang' = 3 1/2 to 4 English miles. Other writers estimated it variously from 30 to 60 stades (cf. Strabo, 518), while Agathias (sixth century A.D.) as 21 stades. o(do\\s e)s *(hli/ou po/lin: i.e. sailing up the Pelusiac arm, which is the natural approach to Heliopolis; like a true Greek, H. went everywhere he could by water; by this route his measurement of 1,500 stades is roughly right. In c. 9 he is found to give the distance from the sea to Heliopolis as 1,260 stades (i.e. from the sea to Thebes ... ... 6,120 less from Heliopolis to Thebes ... ... 4,860 \u2014 1,260); but in that passage he is reckoning directly north and south, in estimating the size of Egypt. The reference to Athens (cf. 156. 6; 177. 2) is one of the passages on which Kirchhoff bases his theory that Bk. II was written at Athens, but of course it proves nothing. (Cf. Introd. \u00a7 10.) For the altar and its use as a starting-point for measurements cf. vi. 108. 4 n. The town of Pisa had been destroyed in 572 B.C.; the distance here given by H. is very exact. The negative mh/ is due to idea of prevention in dia/foron (quominus pares sint). o)/ros parate/tatai. H. is quite right in remarking that the mountains begin at Heliopolis, but his conception of them is very vague; he gives them an extension (makro/taton) from east to west of 'two months' journey'. tau/th|: 'the mountains cease at the quarries, and bend back to the sea.' This is the most natural translation of the passage; but others translate 'ceasing at the parts mentioned (i.e. at the Red Sea), bend back', i.e. are double. The quarries are still a conspicuous feature in this region. a)po\\ h)ou=s. Stein thinks H. says 'from east to west', because he is reproducing Phoenician information; cf. e)punqano/mhn (but v. i.). to\\ pro\\s *libu/hs. H. does not accept the name of 'the Libyan mountain' (cf. \u00a7 3 ad fin.*l. kaleo/menon); to him it is 'the Egyptian mountain on the side of Libya', as opposed to to\\ th=s *)arabi/hs o)/ros. ya/mmw|. This drifting of the sand is well seen at the Sphinx, of which only the head is left exposed. tro/pon, 'direction' (cf. i. 189. 3). w(s ei)=nai it is Egypt' (cf. *a. e)ou=sainf. in same sense); i.e. H. thinks that the land becomes wide again when Egypt ceases and Nubia begins. Others refer these phrases to the breadth, not the length of the land, meaning that beyond the Nile Valley on east and west lie Arabia and Libya, not Egypt. kai\\ de/ka: these words are inserted without MS. authority to make H. consistent. It is calculated that he gives the whole distance from Heliopolis to the frontier as 13 2/3 days; for from Heliopolis to Thebes, reckoning 540 stades a day, is 9 days (9. 2); from Thebes to Elephantine is 3 1/3 days more ['1,800 stades', 9. 2]; from Elephantine to the frontier is 12 sxoi=noi, which, according to his usual method of calculation (6. 1 n., i.e. 9 sxoi=noi to the day's journey), make 1 1/3 days; i.e. 9 + 3 1/3 + 1 1/3 = 13 2/3 in all. This change of reading also would explain H.'s strange statement (below) that Egypt becomes 'broad again'; he would mean the same as in 29. 3, i. e. that where Egypt and Aethiopia join, at the island of Tachompso, there is a 'smooth plain'. Of course this is not accurate geographically, but H. does not pretend to have seen the country beyond Elephantine (29. 2). It is usual to alter the reading; but the mistake (of omitting de/ka) is as old as Aristides (ii. 343), i.e. as the second century A.D. If the reading be not altered, three explanations of H.'s mistake are possible, not to mention the drastic measure of arguing that he had never been up the Nile beyond the Fay\u00fbm at all (c. 29 nn.): I. That H. never left his boat, and hence was misled by a merely temporary widening of the Nile valley; of these there are several; we may compare for such a mistake his strange statement as to Ardericca on the Euphrates (i. 185 n.). Measurements were always difficult to ancient travellers; so Strabo (789), a trained geographer, says that the maximum width of h( potami/a *ai)/guptos is 300 stades, which is nearly three times too much. II. Wiedemann argues that H. is misled by a theory of Hecataeus (?), that Egypt was like a double axe in shape *d\u2014*d (cf. Scylax, p. 106, G. G. M. i. 81). This theory was based on symmetry, and there is supposed to be another fragment of it in 28. 3 (see n.), the statement that the Nile flowed north as well as south. But (a) Hecataeus could not have held this theory, for to him only the Delta was Egypt (16. 1 n.); (b) if Hecataeus had held it, surely H. would have been eager to refute a view so absurd (cf. c. 45 n.). III. A new and very ingenious explanation of H.'s geography of the Nile Valley has been given by Sourdille (H. E. pp. 112 seq.). He maintains three points: A. That the 'Arabian mountain' is conceived of as running in two directions, practically at right angles to each other, starting from the 'quarries'. He translates 8. 2 tau/th| lh=gon ktl. 'The mountain ceases on this side and makes a bend towards what I have said' (he means the *)eruqrh\\ qa/lassa in its northern extension, i.e. the Red Sea proper); 'in its most extended part (i.e. that from east to west) it would take, as I learned, two months' journey from east to west, and its eastern end would produce incense.' He argues: (1) That as the 'Arabian mountain' is described at first as running north and south, its course after its 'bend' (a)nakamptei must be different, i. e. east and west. (2) makro/taton must refer to the 'length' east and west of the chain, not (as Stein) to its 'broadening' out in the south. (3) H. clearly distinguishes two parts of the 'Arabian mountain' in \u00a7 2; he mentions one part that there was another part of the Arabian mountain that did not 'run south'. Sourdille points out that H. always gives a direction as from east to west, even though (as here) the starting-point is in the west; also that the mention of the 'spice-bearing regions' (8. 1) at once suggests Arabia (iii. 107. 1). For the geography generally of this part of the mountain chain, cf. 73. 1 n. and 158. 2-3, where he mentions the 'gap' in the mountains, running east and west, through which the canal of Necho passed. This explanation is almost certainly right. B. That the reading tesse/rwn is right. Sourdille points out that the Ethiopians (29. 4) hold ta\\ a)po\\ *)elefanti/nhs; hence the conjecture 'fourteen' carries H. outside Egypt (cf. 8. 3 n.). Retaining 'four', he thinks that to\\ e)nqeu=ten au)=tis eu)re/a refers to the Fay\u00fbm. This really is only one day south of Heliopolis; but H. clearly thought it much further south; for (1) He obviously conceives it as bordering on the 'Thebaic nome' and as 'seven days' voyage from the sea (4. 3). (2) The branch of the Nile, the Bahr Y\u00fbs\u00fbf, which waters the Fay\u00fbm, finally leaves the Nile almost exactly 'four days' journey' above Heliopolis, near the modern Si\u00fbt. If H. conceived this as running west, instead of north and south, we can understand how 'Egypt' appeared to him to broaden out 'four days' above Heliopolis (cf. 150. 1 n.). He certainly did not realize that it ran parallel to the Nile, as a branch of it, for he says (17. 3) the Nile above the Delta flows ei(=s e)w/n. (3) This seems confirmed by what H. says as to Egypt being 'the gift of the Nile' (5. 1). The priests told him this was so as far as L. Moeris, i.e. as far as the source of the Bahr Y\u00fbs\u00fbf mentioned above. H., however, tacitly corrects this by adding 'the land above the lake for three days' journey' as e(/teron toiou=ton, i.e. he thinks the Nile deposit begins, not 'seven days from the sea', but further up still where the Bahr Y\u00fbs\u00fbf first leaves the Nile, near Farsh\u00fbt, 'three days' journey' above Si\u00fbt. This explanation is possible; it saves the veracity of H., but at the expense of his geographical intelligence. C. That in this misunderstanding lies the explanation of H.'s statement that the Nile overflows 'for two days' journey, more or less, on each side' (19. 1). What the canals of the Nile do, that it does itself. The Bahr Y\u00fbs\u00fbf on the west and the canal of Necho on the east have the extension here mentioned, which is obviously wrong if attributed to the Nile itself. *ai)/guptos e)ou=sa: this word has a double construction\u2014it is the subject of the sentence, and yet goes especially with e)ou=sa. dihkosi/wn. This breadth, about twenty-three miles, is too great. In the four days' journey above Heliopolis, the widest place is only about fifteen. The mistake is natural, as H. kept mainly to the river and had to judge distances by the eye. e)nne/a. H. here allows 540 stades (4860 <*> 9) for a day's journey; at this rate the whole distance from the sea to Elephantine up stream would be done in 6120 + 1800 <*> 540, i. e. 14 2/3 days. But in c. 175 the voyage down stream only to Sais takes twenty days. Two explanations may be given of the discrepancy: (1) Wiedemann's (doubtfully) that H. went up stream by an unusually fast boat, a fact which would partly explain his scanty knowledge of Upper Egypt; the figure in c. 175 is that of a heavy-laden cargo boat. (2) (More probably) the figure here is a mere calculation, based on the supposed rate of 'nine schoenes a day'; the figure in c. 175 is that of an actual voyage. Sourdille (H. E. p. 109) thinks the 'nine days' the official estimate for a fast government boat (cf. viii. 98 for the post system); H. has taken this as if it were the normal speed. The journey from Heliopolis to Thebes by boat usually now takes over twelve days (Stein). suntiqe/menoi ktl., 'if we put together the number of stades in Egypt.' The words have no construction. In any case H.'s figures are too big, owing to his over-estimate of the sxoi=nos (cp. 6. 1 n.); from Thebes to Heliopolis is really 421 miles, not 552 (as H.). At Iliun the rivers are the Simois and the Scamander, in Teuthrania the Caicus, at Ephesus the Cayster and (to the south) the Maeander. At Ephesus the sea has receded about three miles (Leake). The whole subject is dealt with in Strabo (691), who calls the plains potamw=n gennh/mata, quoting H. (cp. Thuc. ii. 102; but his prophecy, that all the Echinades would become mainland, has not been fulfilled). H. gives the five mouths in c. 17; he omits here the Bolbitic and the Bucolic mouths as artificial. For the *)eruqrh\\ qala/ssh and the *)ara/bios ko/lpos cf. i. 1. 1 n. ei)resi/h|. H. uses this measurement of the Caspian (i. 203. 1 n.); for a 'day's sail' cf. vii. 183. 3 n. His calculation seems to suit the length of the Red Sea (which is about 1,200 miles), but his breadth is much too small; he seems to have confused the northwest arm, the Gulf of Suez, and the main sea. The former averages 30 miles in breadth, but the sea itself varies from 130 miles in the north to 250 in the south (E. B. xxii. 970). to\\n me/n: in loose apposition to e(/teron ko/lpon: H. then forgets his construction, and goes on to mention again the other gulf, i. e. the 'Arabian Gulf'. The two gulfs, the Red Sea and that which is now Egypt, are conceived as 'boring together', so as to make their 'ends' (muxou/s) nearly meet, but 'missing' each other by 'a little strip of land'. ti/ min kwlu/ei. H. seems, from his rhetorical tone, to be answering some criticisms on his geological views. Probably he allows '20,000' years, because this was roughly his conception of the duration of Egyptian history. H.'s geological remarks in this chapter are mainly right (cf. 5. 1 n.), and show his excellence as an observer. The coast of Egypt does 'project' (prokeime/nhn), 'shells' are frequent, the 'salt efflorescence' on the monuments is well known, and the soil is black and 'friable' (katarrhgnume/nhn). The sand, however, extends much more widely than he says. The Egyptians called their land Qemt or 'Qem', 'the black' art'. For Moeris cp. c. 101 n., o(/te tw=n . . . h)/kouon. These words seem to imply that some interval had elapsed between the time when H. heard the statement and when he wrote this passage; Meyer (F. i. 156) concludes that H. was in Egypt about 440 B. C., and wrote Bk. II about 430. The height of the Nile flood was measured at Memphis, just above Rodah near Cairo, where the Nilometer now stands. A scanty Nile rises 20 feet or less, a good one from 24 to 27. The sixteen child figures on the well-known Nile statue in the Vatican symbolize a rise of 16 cubits (24 feet), i. e. a good Nile. ph/xeas: H. seems to take the cubit as 18 1/2 inches (as in Greece), not as 21 (the royal cubit, cf. i. 178. 3 n.). H. is wrong in saying the height of the inundations had altered so much in historic times; perhaps he has confused geographical variations (i. e. at different parts of the Nile) with historical ones (i. e. at different periods). ei) mh\\ . . . a)nabh=|: for omission Goodwin, \u00a7 468. h)\\n ou(/tw h( xw/rh. Translate 'If this land rises in height proportionately (to its rise in the past) and duly makes (a)podidoi=) a like increase in extent', then it will be reached by the flood water with more difficulty. H. ignores the fact that the river-bed rises proportionately to the river-banks. a)postrofh/: properly an 'escape from', so a 'resource' (viii. 109. 5). Here used oddly with gen. = 'a resource for getting water'. For the contrast between artificial irrigation and rainfall cf. Deuteronomy xi. 10-12. For rain in Egypt cf. iii. 10. 3 n. In this chapter H. exaggerates the contrast between Egypt and Greece (cp. c. 35 nn.). It was only in parts of the Delta that the plough could be dispensed with. Sheep are represented on the monuments of the 'Old Kingdom' as treading in the seed (cf. Breasted, p. 92), and swine also on one tomb at Thebes (B. M. G. p. 95) tread out the corn. Quite recently a monument has been discovered at Dra abu'l Naga which absolutely confirms H. (Ann. du Serv. des Antiq. xi. 162 seq.). Cf. also Eudoxus (in Ael. H. A. x. 16), and Pliny, N.

The usual identification of the 'watch-tower of Perseus' is with C. Aboukir, in which case it would lie outside the Delta. Strabo (801) places it near the Bolbitic mouth, which is probably right. In that case H. is wrong in making it the extreme west limit of the Delta (Sourdille, H. E. 58-9). tw=n *phlousiakw=n. Pelusium was the east gate of Egypt (cp. 141. 4 and 154 n., where H. describes the planting of the Greek mercenaries of Psammetichus there. The estimate of '40 schoenes' is nearer right than H.'s 60 (6. 1 n.). Cercasorus is about four miles north of Cairo; the Nile now divides a little lower down. lego/ntwn: agrees with *)iw/nwn, but is parallel to le/gontes, which goes with oi(/ fasi. Canobus lies about fifteen miles north-east of Alexandria, at the north-east end of Aboukir Bay, the scene of Nelson's great victory in 1798. It was said to have been founded by Menelaus, in memory of his pilot, who died there of snake-bite (Tac. Ann. ii. 60); at any rate, it was a comparatively recent town. It was famous for its temple of Serapis, and still more for its vice (cf. Juv. vi. 84; Sen. Ep. 51). It is to be noticed that Greek myths in Egypt were especially connected with the north-west corner of the Delta (cf. 178 nn.): so we have the watch-tower of Perseus (15. 1), Archandrus (98. 2), and Helen (113. 1) in these parts. H. adopts the view that Egyptian culture began up the Nile and came down stream 'gradually' (u(po-); this was inevitable, as he thought the Delta so comparatively recent; it was also supported by the fact that 'Thebes' only was mentioned by Homer. He is confirmed by the First Dynasty tombs at Abydos (King and Hall, pp. 59 f.), though the buildings of Thebes belong to the 'Middle' and the 'New Kingdom'. peri/metron. This figure, 6, 120 stades, for the 'circumference' of the Thebaic nome, was given to H.; it is not the result of his own measurements. But its exact recurrence here and in 9. 2 is suspicious. H. has refuted the Ionian view, that Egypt was only the Delta (15. 1) in the preceding chapter; he now proceeds to argue that it is inconsistent with the accepted doctrine that there were three continents (oi(/ fasi tri/a mo/ria ktl.: cf. iv. 45. 5). He seems to think that if Egypt were the Delta, it was in neither Asia nor Libya (v. i.), but a 'fourth' part. His argument, however, is very obscure. logi/zesqai, 'they cannot count,' as they ignore the Delta. tou=ton to\\n lo/gon. The argument seems to be; Egypt is enclosed by the Nile, therefore the Nile cannot be the boundary of Asia and Libya, as this would leave Egypt unaccounted for. th=| *libu/h|: the dative is curious. Cf. a similar use of xwri/zw in iv. 28. 2. H. states two geographical positions in this chapter: (1) that Egypt is one and indivisible (not, as the view of the Greeks would imply, half in Asia and half in Africa); (2) that the boundaries of Asia and Africa are (not the Nile, but) the boundaries of Egypt. To which continent H. would assign Egypt he leaves uncertain (cf. iv. 39 2 n.). *katadou/pwn: the first cataract, i. e. the furthest to the north; for it cf. 29. 2 n. For the Nile branches (sto/mata) cf. 10. 2 n. The number of 'branches' (sto/mata) is usually given as seven. Of these the 'Tanitic', i. e. the second from the east, between the Pelusiac and the Mendesian, is not named by H., who calls it Strabo (802) explanations are given: (1) the simplest is that of Stein, that beside the well-known 'Sais', there was a second town of that name in the eastern Delta. But there is no monumental evidence for a second 'Sais'. (2) Wiedemann seems to suppose that the Saites claimed the Canopic arm, on which their town stood, as their own, and that H., misled by them, counts it twice over, under its real name 'Canopic', and under its supposed name 'Saitic'. (3) Sourdille (H. E. 53) thinks that the Tanitic arm was called 'Sanitic', and that H., not recognizing its connexion with the *tani/ths nomo/s of c. 166, confused the unfamiliar name with the familiar *saitiko/n. We may compare the probable confusion in 'Nitocris' (cf. i. 185. 1 n.). The order from east to west is: (1) Pelusiac (or Bubastic), (2) Tanitic (or (or Naucratic). th=s e)mewutou=: cf. 104. 1 for a similar touch of complacency as to Colchis. If the modern theory (cf. Introd. \u00a7 11) is held that Bk. II is the last composed by H., this 'oracle of Ammon' must be one of his latest pieces of information. *mare/hs: the frontier garrison of Egypt (cf. 30. 2 n.) on the west under the Saite dynasty, on the well-known Mareotic Lake. *)/apios: a place called 'Apis' lay (Strabo, 799) twelve miles west of Paraetonium and five days' journey from the oracle of Ammon; it was over 150 miles due west of Alexandria. But this place is obviously too remote to be the 'Apis' mentioned here, which probably lay a little south of Naucratis. As Isis (to whom the cow was sacred) was especially worshipped in this region, Wiedemann thinks the reason given here improbable, and that the real question was\u2014should they join Inaros in revolt or remain loyal to the Great King? This is a probable date for the oracle, but the two explanations are consistent; Inaros belonged to the Egyptian party among the Libyans, who abstained from cowflesh (cf. iv. 186); but these Libyans wished to be free from Egyptian restrictions, and hence were unwilling to join in the revolt. du/o h(mere/wn. Sayce says (J. of P. xiv. 260) that it is only in the region of the Fay\u00fbm that the Nile rises so much; 'H. (wrongly) assumed that what was true of one part of its course might be true of other parts.' However, H. may still be speaking of the region of the Delta, and mean that not only the Delta, but the adjoining country, was flooded. For a more elaborate explanation cf. 8. 3 n. The date of the rise of the Nile varies with the place; it begins at Khartoum early in April, but at Cairo about the end of June; H. therefore is fairly right in his 'summer solstice'; so, too, is he in his statement that it rises for 'one hundred days'. As he does not notice its changes of colour, first green, then blood-red, it is inferred with some reason that he did not himself see the beginning of a Nile flood. The statement that no winds 'blow from' the Nile has been much attacked (e.g. by Sayce), because it has been understood to mean that no breeze is felt on the river; but H. himself tells us of the Etesian winds (20. 2) and of the 'fresh wind' (96. 3) up the Nile. He means (cf. c. 27) that there are no breezes down the Nile, i. e. from the south, whence the Nile flows; this is practically right. In five months (from June to October) scientific observation shows that the wind blows from this direction only about one day in twelve (Sourdille, H. E. 111), and from the south (speaking strictly) less than one day in thirty. ei) mh\\ o(/son: sc. mnhsqh/somai, 'except 20, 21) of Thales and Hecataeus, H. thinks, need no refutation, although he proceeds to refute them. H., as usual, is contemptuous of his countrymen. Thales of Miletus (Athen. ii. 87) attributed the rise of the Nile to its being held back by the Etesian winds. H.'s refutation is sensible; the winds blow from the north-west, and so would have affected equally the rivers of Africa and of Syria. But it must be admitted that neither land has 'many rivers', and of the Syrian ones, the Orontes flows south-west, and so would not have been affected. In Africa H. knew of the Cinyps and the Triton (iv. 175, 178 nn.). The theory that the Nile flowed from the circumambient Ocean (cf. c. 23 n.) was widely held. H. is probably refuting Hecataeus (cf. F. H. G. i. 19, fr. 278 for his view); but the Egyptian priests gave the same explanation of the Nile flood (Diod. i. 37). lo/gw| ei)pei=n: not 'so to speak', but 'more marvellous to state'. The view that the Nile rose because of melting snow is called by H. by far the 'most attractive', but also 'especially inaccurate'. It was held by Anaxagoras (Diod. i. 38) and his pupil, Euripides (fr. 230), but can be traced further back, is very near the truth. The Nile rises partly because of the heavy rains on the Abyssinian plateau, partly from the melting snow on the mountains round the Great Lakes; the former are brought down by the Blue Nile, the latter by the White Nile, which meet at Khartoum. H. rejects the theory because: (1) 'It flows from the hottest lands to those of which most are colder', as is shown by the warmth of the winds. (2) Upper Egypt was rainless (cf. iii. 10. 3 n.), and Aethiopia must also be so; but snow is always followed by rain within five days (\u00a7 3). (3) The inhabitants are black from the heat \u00a7 3). (4) The birds do not migrate from Aethiopia, as they would do were there winter there (\u00a7 4). H. tries to apply critical tests to a fact which seems to him insufficiently supported by evidence, and so arrives at a wrong conclusion (cf. iii. 115. 1 n. for similar criticism). kai\\ o(/son w)=n, 'ever so little.' a)fane/s. The reference is clearly to a definite person, i. e. Hecataeus. H. means that the theory of the circumambient ocean is, as we should say, outside the region of science. It was based on various kinds of evidence: (1) Homer, Il. xviii. 607-8, speaks of Ocean as encircling the shield of Achilles. The theory may have been Phoenician in origin (Tozer, A. G. p. 21), but (2) it suited the Greek notion of symmetry; Delphi was the centre of the earth, and the Ocean supplied a natural circumference. (3) Facts were supposed to confirm it; the Greeks knew of water in the furthest west and south, and the Caspian was supposed to be an arm on the North Ocean; cf. i. 202. 4 n. for H.'s rejection of this view. Berger, pp. 36, 41, asserts that H. is wrong in deriving the theory of the Ionian physicists from Homer; but his assertion is neither proved nor probable. H. rightly rejects the theory of the circumambient ocean as unsupported by evidence. For a similar rejection of a priori geography cf. iv. 36. 2 n. a)rxai/hs: i.e. the sun's 'usual course', direct east and west. To H. the earth is a flat surface, over which the sun moves in an arc (cf. iii. 104 n. and App. XIII. 3). xeimw/nwn. The theory that the sun's course was affected by storms was adopted by Democritus, who applied it also to the moon and stars. Cp. Lucr., R. N. v. in c. 24 (e)n e)laxi/stw| dhlw=sai). The sun 'in the winter is blown out of his course by the storms' (24. 1) from the north, and so 'crosses over the upper parts of Libya'. Hence evaporation there is abundant (\u00a7\u00a7 1-2) and so the Nile loses its water; the south and south-west winds blowing from this quarter are wet, but part of the moisture 'remains with' the sun (\u00a7 3, v. i.). When 'the winter storms begin to be less severe' (\u00a7 3), the sun returns to his normal course, and then 'draws water from all rivers equally'. Hence in the summer the Nile is like all other rivers in the amount of evaporation from it; but in the winter 'it alone suffers from the sun', and so its course is 'lower than in the summer' (\u00a7 5). In fact, H. thinks the normal height of the Nile is its summer flood, and the low Nile of the winter is the exception. This theory is referred to in Aristoph. Nub. 273, and is attacked by Diodorus, i. 38, and Aristides, ii. 341, who rightly say that if it were true, other African rivers ought to show the same phenomenon. ai)qri/ou ktl. Evaporation is assisted 'as the air is clear and the soil dry, even without cool winds'. th/kousi, 'waste,' i. e. the water drawn up from the Nile. The 'south and south-west winds' are wet in Greece, but are not really so in Egypt. u(polei/pesqai, 'to let some remain behind with himself,' i. e. as nourishment. This is the theory of Thales that the sun and the stars were fed by water; later, the Stoics adopted it in the form that the sun was nourished by the sea (Cic. de Nat.

L. v. 423-5: The sun, that light imparts to all, receivesFrom all his alimental recompenseIn humid exhalations. i. to\\n xro/non below (\u00a7 5); the land 'being soaked with rains and furrowed with channels', lets the rain flow into the rivers, unlike the a)leeinh\\ xw/rh (\u00a7 1) in Libya. oi( me/n: the rivers of the north as opposed to the Nile. to\\n tau/th|: i. e. in Aethiopia. H. applies his theory to answer his other question why there is no wind from the river (19. 3 n.); he thinks no wind from the south could be expected, as it was too hot. It is needless to add that H. knew nothing of the causes of winds. w(s ka/rta is emphatic from its separate position. The name 'Nile' is probably Semitic = 'river', the native name was Hpi; for an image of the river-god cf. B. M. G. p. 12. The source of the Nile was an insoluble problem till the latter half of the nineteenth century. H. wisely gives it up, but narrates a story which he heard on good authority, but thinks was meant 'as a joke' (pai/zein). His narrative is attacked in two ways. (1) He is accused of believing the story which he definitely rejects, e.g. by Strabo 387). This charge simply proves the carelessness of his critics. (2) The second charge is more serious, and is as old as Aristides (ii. 344-5): If H. had been on the spot, how could he repeat a story so obviously false? Three answers may be given: (a Stein thinks H. simply refers to the narrow bed of the river at Syene; but this explanation cannot be got out of the text. (b Perhaps Sourdille (H. E. 227 seq.) is right in saying that H. thought the town on the island 'Elephantine' and Syene opposite to be only one town; this he called 'Elephantine' and frequently mentions; Syene, on the other hand, he never mentions except here. He may well therefore have thought Syene to be some place, unvisited by him, away to the south; hence the Saite's story might be right, and he gives it and criticizes it. (c) Hauvette's (pp. 16, 17) view, however, is preferable, that H. means pai/zein to indicate definite rejection of the story, which he still goes on to criticize. It may be noted that H.'s account made so great an impression that Tacitus (Ann. ii. 61) puts 'angustiae et profunda altitudo nullis inquirentium spatiis which Germanicus 'gave his attention'. A further point arises\u2014what did the Saite really mean? Probably 'he was speaking what (he meant to be) true' (\u00a7 5 gino/mena). Three views may be mentioned: (1) Maspero thinks (E. M. iii. 382 seq.) that H. has taken as geography what was really mythology. In the Ritual of Embalmment the dead is addressed, 'He (the Nile) gives thee the water which has come from Elephantine, the Nile which has come from the two gulfs, the Nou which has come from the two rocks.' A bas-relief has been found at Philae representing the Nile god in a cavern under a rock, pouring out two Niles (cf. B. M. G. p. 8 for picture). Maspero further explains 'Krophi' and 'Mophi' to be 'Qer Hpi' (cavern of the Nile god) and 'Mu-Hpi' (water of the Nile god). He thinks that the priest also said that there were two Niles, one of Egypt, and one of Ethiopia; of these the former flowed along the right bank, the latter along the left. H. misunderstood his informant, and supposed the 'Nile of Ethiopia' meant the Nile flowing towards Ethiopia, as opposed to the Nile of Egypt. (2) The B. M. G. makes the two Niles the rivers of Upper and of Lower Egypt respectively. (3) Breasted (pp. 55-6) says there was supposed to be an underground Nile, by which the sun returned at night to the east; some thought it came up again as the Indus; this was connected with the real Nile at Elephantine, which was originally the limit of Egyptian knowledge to the south. Maspero's view is probably nearest to what the Saite said. It is quite needless to see the influence of Hecataeus (cf. 8. 3 n.) in the story. grammatisth/s: the temple treasurer; this Saite was probably the only high official whom H. met. For Athena cf. 62. 1 n. Syene:hod. Ass\u00fban; its name 'Suan' is as old as the Sixth Dynasty. Under the Ptolemies it succeeded Elephantine as the capital of Upper Egypt; it was the Roman frontier garrisontown; cf. Tac. Ann. ii. 61 'claustra Romani imperii'. For the inquiring turn of Psammetienus I cf. c. 2. au)to/pths. This statement is especially attacked as untrue by Sayce (ad loc. and Introd. p. 27; also in J. of P. xiv). His arguments are (answers are added in brackets): (1) Elephantine is an island\u2014not a town (it is both, cf. Artace iv. 14. 2, and in Egyptian records is frequently called 'a town'). (2) H. makes Amasis bring stones from Elephantine (175. 3 n.); the red granite quarries were really at Syene (cf. 'Syenite'). (But Egyptian sources also call granite 'stone from Elephantine'.) (3) H. could never have been at Thebes, or he would describe the great buildings there. (The argument ex silentio is always most untrustworthy; cf. also 143. 2 n.) (4) Had H. been at Elephantine he would have known more of the Nile's course above it. (But cf. notes on following chapters, which show that his knowledge was really considerable.) Sayce's attack is usually held to fail completely. Elephantine = 'Elephant town', because here the Nubians brought their ivory for tribute (iii. 97. 3) or to exchange it for Egyptian products. H. is quite right in his description of the way in which a boat is towed up the first cataract\u2014'from both sides' (dia-; a)mfote/rwqen is really superfluous); he does not give the exaggerated difficulties which later writers ascribe to the cataracts, e.g. that the dwellers around were permanently deaf from the noise (Cicero, Som. Scip. 5). 'The foaming rapids of the Great Cataract are now things of the past' (Baedeker, p. 335), owing to the Nile Dam built just above. For the rest of this chapter cf. E. Sparig, Herodot's Angaben \u00fcber die Nill\u00e4nder oberhalb clearly right in identifying Tachompso with Djerar, an island south of Dakkeh, some 78 (Murray, p. 519 and map) miles from Syene; H. here, as usual, reckons the sxoi=nos at 60 stades (cf. Strabo, 804, and 6. 1 n.), which gives about 80 miles for the distance. This was the natural boundary of the two nations (\u00a7 4); just below Djerar was Hierasykaminos, the southern limit of Egypt under the Ptolemies. H. makes no distinction between the first cataract, which begins just below Philae, and the Nile above it. Others, however (e.g. Wiedemann), wrongly identify Tachompso with is then explained as the space a man could tow before being relieved, i.e. about 500 yards; cf. Jerome (on Joel iii. Tachompso with Philae is not what H. says, and it leaves his 'four days' quite unexplained. The distance from Syene to Philae could really be done in rather more than five hours, but perhaps the boatmen demanded such a fee of H. that he imagined it must mean a four days' journey. At all events he never went up the cataract. There is no lake either at Philae or at Djerar; but the Nile widens out above Philae, and at various places south of that island. H. does not give the time spent on 'the lake', i.e. between Philae and the second cataract at Wadi Halfa (where the boat was left a)poba/s). If this be reckoned at four days, H.'s account gives 60 days from Syene to Meroe, i.e. 4 days for the rapids, 4 days for the lake, 40 days' land journey, and 12 more by boat again. This corresponds to the estimate of Timosthenes, admiral of Ptolemy Philadelphus (60 days from Syene to Meroe, Pliny, N. H. vi. 183); 'this is a very approximation to the truth' (Bunbury, i. 302). sko/peloi ktl.: the obstructions on the river, beginning with the second cataract just above Halfa. The river in modern times is usually left here by travellers; the railway from Halfa runs to Abu Hammed, where the Nile turns south-west; the caravan route went straight across the desert from Korosko, 90 miles below Halfa. The 'island' of Meroe later was formed by the Nile and the Atbara (Astaboras), just south of Berber, and ruins of pyramids have been found in this region at Bakarawiya, south of the junction of the two rivers. H., however, probably means the town of Napata, the northern capital of the Aethiopian kingdom, which lay (near the modern Merawi, which preserves the name) some thirty miles south-west of the fourth cataract, under the 'holy mountain', Gebel Barkal. (So Sparig, and Hall in Murray, p. 552.) H. had certainly never heard of the River Atbara (cf. iv. 50. 1), and the southern site for Meroe seems inconsistent with (30. 1) the statement that Meroe is only half way to the 'Deserters'. If, however, Meroe be Napata, then the 'twelve days' voyage' must be explained as not continuous, as H. had been told, but made up of two parts, one from just below Djerar (u. s.) to Halfa, and one from El Debba (south of Dongola) to Merawi. *di/a. There is a temple of Amon (i.e. Zeus) at Napata, where he was worshipped in a ram-headed shape. H. is quite right in speaking of the theocratic character of the Ethiopian kingdom; the oracle at Napata chose the king (cf. Diod. iii. 5. 6 of the later Meroe). As Ethiopia had been conquered by kings from Thebes, the Theban deities naturally were more prominent there, and the high priests of Amon, expelled by the 22nd dynasty from Thebes, had retired to Ethiopia (Maspero, Annuaire des E. G. 1877, p. 126 seq., gives interesting details as to the working of the oracle). i)/sw|: i.e. in 60 days; this estimate may well be exaggerated. As usual H. becomes less accurate as he gets further away from his own observations. The Deserters. Some moderns (e.g. Wiedemann) have doubted the whole story, but it is now generally accepted. Maspero (iii. 498) points out that in the seventh century the military Mashauasha disappear from the monuments; he considers the divisions of ii. 164 seq. to be the new army arrangements of Psammetichus. For an interesting parallel under Apries to the desertion cf. statue of Nesuhor, in Louvre, with its inscription (Klio, iv. 152 seq.; Breasted, R. iv. 989 seq.). Eratosthenes (in Strabo 786) calls these deserters *sembri=tai, i.e. e)ph/ludes. They are variously placed in Abyssinia, on the Blue Nile, or in Sennaar (Bunbury), about 150 miles south of Khartoum, or where the Sobat joins the White Nile, about 400 miles south of Khartoum. It is in the last region that the Nile ceases to flow west and north-west and turns north (cf. 31 n.). *)asma/x. The translation 'left' is a popular explanation, perhaps given by an interpreter; the real meaning of the word was 'forgetting', i.e. it = 'runaways'. But the word for 'left' in Egyptian is very similar in sound (Spiegelberg, Z. \u00c4. S. xliii. 95). The number 240,000 is doubtless much exaggerated. Elephantine, Marea, Daphnae are the three gates of Egypt towards Ethiopia, Syria, and Libya. For Marea cf. 18. 2 n. and inf. Daphnae has been identified as Tell Defenneh, near L. Menzaleh, between the Delta and the Suez Canal; it lies on the Pelusiac arm of the Nile (now a canal). (Petrie, E. E. F. iv. (1888) 47.) Here the earliest remains belong to the Ramesside age; but the fort was founded by Psammetichus I, and the oldest finds in it were mainly Greek (ib. p. 48); then from the sixth century Greek remains disappear (p. 52). All this agrees with H.; cf. 107. 1 for Sesostris (i. e. Rameses II; but cf. App. X. 5, 7) at Daphnae, and 154. 3 for the planting the Greeks on the Pelusiac arm, and their subsequent removal by Amasis. H., however, distinguishes Daphnae and 'the Camps', whereas Petrie makes them the same; probably both are right; one of the military 'camps' lay outside the native town, but continuous with it. Daphnae guarded 'the great highway into Syria' (Petrie u. tau/th| ei)si\\n ai( e)/ti e)p' e)meu=: this reference to the Persian garrisons seems to show that H. was in Egypt after 454 B.C. (cf. App. IX, \u00a7 1). The garrison at Marea was given up, because the Libyans to the west were completely reduced (Stein, cf. iii. 91; iv. 167 seq.); this reason is more probable than that of Krall, viz. that the defence of the west was entrusted to native princes, e.g. Inaros and Thannyras (iii. 15). Sourdille (H. E. p. 3) thinks that H. had been told generally that 'the Persian garrison system was the same' as the Egyptian, but says nothing special as to Marea, because he had not verified the statement as to the garrison there personally, as he had done at Elephantine and at Daphnae. This explanation seems over-subtle. e)s *ai)qiopi/hn. One of the points attacked in the story is the implication that the fugitives traversed the whole of Egypt. The story is at least consistent; it would not be easy to stop '240,000' armed and organized runaways. de/canta. The grossness here (cf. 162. 3, the reply of Amasis) belongs to the story of a guide, catering for Greek taste; the native Egyptian had far too much respect for royalty to answer thus. Wiedemann denies that Egyptian influence on Ethiopia is so late; he considers that the story was invented to explain Egyptian influence in that country, and points out that Ethiopia had been conquered, as far as the second cataract, under the 12th Dynasty, not to mention later relations (cf. App. X, \u00a7 9). tesse/rwn. Cf. 29. 4, 30. I nn. for the figure. r(e/ei de\\ a)po\\ ktl. These words are taken two ways: (1) The usual view, e.g. Rawlinson's, is that H. means the Nile was flowing from east to west at the furthest point at which he knew of it, i.e. in the land of the Deserters. (2) But this is not the natural sense of the passage, and it is better to suppose that H. conceives the Nile as flowing from the west in all its course above Elephantine (Bunbury, i. 266, 303), because a) He compares it with the Danube, c. 33; b) Europe is 'beyond comparison' the broadest of his continents (iv. 42. 1 n.); but this could hardly be the case, if Africa were more than four mountains 'broad' from north to south, as explanation (1) would make it. c) When Cambyses attacks the Ethiopians, at 'the end of the world', 'on the sea to the south of Africa' (iii. 17. 5), he does not march up the Nile, but plunges into the deserts just south of Thebes. Obviously, then, the Nile is here conceived as coming not from the south but from the west. Some have tried to identify the Ethiopians with the Deserters, but this is flatly contradictory to H. H. is at any rate consistent in this mistake. Its origin is no doubt the fact that the Nile from 21\u00b0 to 23\u00b0 S. Lat. flows north-west, and almost down to Philae (which is about 24\u00b0) is a little west in direction. The story of the Nasamones (cf. Bunbury, i. 306) is a good instance how valuable at times is a traveller's tale; it reaches H. third-hand, and hence is naturally untrustworthy in detail; but in its main point it seems to be true. There is nothing impossible in a 'well-equipped' native expedition crossing the Sahara and reaching the Niger, which at its nearest point comes within about 1000 miles of the oasis of Fezzan. That Negro land was really reached seems probable from the following points: the natives were entirely strange in speech (\u00a7 6), black (\u00a7 7), very small (\u00a7\u00a7 6, 7), 'all wizards' (33. 1). The story is accepted by R. Neumann (pp. 78 seq.) and by St. Martin (pp. 17-18), who, however, brings the explorers north-west to the oasis of Wargla in the Algerian Sahara. *kurhnai=oi. That H. had been in Cyrene is almost certain (cf. Introd. \u00a7 16). Etearchus is probably a Greek form of the Nubian Taharka. *)/ammwnos. The oracle of the ram-headed (cf. c. 42 for the origin of the figure) Zeus was one of the most famous of antiquity. Croesus consulted it (i. 46), Lysander (Plut. Lys. 20), and above all, Alexander the Great; for it cf. 18. 2; iii. 25 It was in the oasis of Siwah, a great caravan centre. H. is always careful to distinguish it from its parent oracle, that of the Theban Amon, who was also ram-headed. For the connexion of Cyrene and Zeus Ammon cf. the ram-headed god on the coins of Cyrene, Head, H. N. 865, 868. For the Nasamones cf. iv. 172, 182. They had most of the trade with the interior in their hands, and were also well known as freebooters; hence they were a likely people to turn explorers. *su/rtin: the greater Syrtis, as always in H.; he does not know the lesser one. ta\\ me/n (sc.oi)ke/ousi): the construction changes to parh/kousi para/. borhi/hn: Mediterranean Sea. *solo/entos (cf. iv. 43. 4); Cape Spartel on the coast of Morocco (near Tangier); others make it Cape Cantin (in latitude de\\ u(pe/r: adverbial, as is ta\\ katu/perqe; for the threefold belt of North Africa cf. iv. 181 n.; for the Libyans iv. 168 seq. ze/furon: properly 'westward'; but if it be translated strictly, the travellers would have had nothing but deserts and ultimately the Atlantic before them (v.s.). The word, however, is decisive against the theory of the journey, which makes the explorers only reach some river running into Lake Tchad; this would be due south of the Fezzan. The story of the 'little men' (cf. iv. 43. 5), the Pygmies, is as old as Homer (Il. iii. 3-7), and recurs repeatedly in ancient writers. It was much doubted by modern writers till the explorations of Du Chaillu, Schweinfurth, and others proved completely the existence of these dwarfs, both north and south of the Equator (cf. Rev. Hist. 47 for a collection of the evidence on the subject by Monceaux). This is one of the best-known of the many instances in which H.'s 'credulity' has been shown to be scientific. H. does not exaggerate their smallness as other writers do; their average height is said to be about 4 1/2 feet. Dwarfs from the south were favourites at the Egyptian court as early as the Old Kingdom (cf. Breasted, A. R. i. 351, of the 6th Dynasty). The 'swamps' (e(le/wn) are characteristic of all Central African rivers, and are abundant on the Niger. The town has been supposed to be Timbuctoo, but this was only founded about 1000 A. D. Crocodiles were supposed to be peculiar to the Nile. So Alexander (Arr. Anab. vi. 1. 2), seeing crocodiles in the Indus, thought that he had found the source of the Nile. H.'s theory that the Nile rose in West Africa never had much popularity till Roman times; it was held by the learned Juba of Mauretania (Plin. v. 51). We may compare it with the theories of forty years ago, which identified the Lualuba, when discovered by Livingstone, with the Nile, till Stanley proved it to be the upper waters of the Congo. H.'s view is based (cf. also 31 n.) on (1) the supposed analogy of the Danube; cf. cc. 33, 34, and especially e)k tw=n i)/swn me/trwn; as the Danube flows across Europe from the west, so the Nile is supposed to flow across Libya; (2) the story of the Nasamones. toi=si e)mfane/si: this toi=s faneroi=s tekmai/rou; te has no corresponding kai/; c. 34 continues the account. */istros. H. is much interested in this river, which he describes again in iv. 48-50 (where 'it is the greatest of all rivers that we know'; cf. also iv. 99). Here he supposes it to rise in the extreme west of Europe. This view was held also by Aristotle [Meteor. i. 'flows through the whole of Europe']. It is difficult to see how the Greeks reconciled it with their knowledge of the Rhone, but it is suggested that this was looked on as a southern offshoot of the Danube. Older geographers had made the Ister rise in the Rhipaean mountains, among the Hyperboreans; H. rightly ignored this mythical explanation, but his information was insufficient for an accurate account. *purh/nh: an old town at the foot of the Pyrenees (hod. Port Vendres); its trade passed to Massilia, and its name was transferred to the neighbouring mountains (cf. iv. 49. 2 n. for a similar transference of *)/alpis and *ka/rpis). *keltoi/. H. derives his information, indirectly at any rate, from he Phoenicians, and therefore speaks of the Celts as being 'outside the Pillars of Hercules', where the Phoenicians found them. The 'Pillars of Hercules' are not found in Homer, but in Pindar (Olym. iii. 44) they occur, as the limit of the world; by H.'s time they had been definitely fixed. For the legends connecting Heracles with the W. cf. iv. 8 seq. The name was partly due to the identification of Heracles with the Tyrian Melcarth, partly to the tendency (Tac. Germ. 34) to give him 'quidquid ubique magnificum'. Strabo (169-72) discusses the legends as but Pomponius Mela (i. 5. 27), as befits a Spaniard, is the first to give an accurate account of them. So far as they are a reality, they correspond to Calpe and Abila (i.e. Gibraltar and the African Ceuta). The Kynesioi (*ku/nhtes, iv. 49. 3) are placed by Avienus (201 seq.) on the Guadiana. Their name disappears early from geography. *)istri/hn: near the modern Kustendji: it lies some sixty miles south of the St. George's mouth of the Danube. a)nti/h kei=tai H. seems to be trying to construct a rough parallel of longitude (cf. App. XIII, \u00a7 4). If he meant that the Ister mouth is about opposite the west mouth of the Nile he is right (they are each about 28\u00b0 E. Lat.); but his arguments are wrong, for Cilicia Trachea is east of all the Nile mouths and Sinope further east still. pe/nte. Cf. i. 72. 3 n. e)cisou=sqai. H. ends with the statement with which he began The comparison is based on the love of symmetry which he tries in vain to banish from his geography (cf. App. XIII, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 7); but this does not lead him to distort the facts he knows, e.g. he rightly says that the Ister (iv. 99. 1) runs into the sea pro\\s eu)=ron, though obviously this direction does not suit his theory here. H.'s account of Egypt, cc. 35-98. This is the most valuable part of Bk. II (cf. App. IX, \u00a7 4). It opens with the famous paradox that everything in Egypt is the reverse of what it is elsewhere (\u00a7 2). This point is borrowed by Sophocles (O. C. 337 seq.), who makes Oedipus contrast his Soph. cf. Introd. p. 7]. But it must be added that there are no verbal similarities in the two passages. The point is made by other Greek writers, e. g. Anaxandrides (Athen. 299), a comic poet circ. 370 B.C., draws an elaborate contrast between Greece and Egypt; his illustrations are from the treatment of animals, e.g. bou=n proskunei=s, e)gw\\ de\\ qu/w toi=s qeoi=s. It is even more exaggerated later, e.g. by Diod. i. 27 (as to incestuous marriages). Nymphodorus (a third-century writer, F. H. G. ii. 380) absurdly puts the topsyturvydom down to Sesostris, who wished to make his subjects effeminate and so prevent their demanding liberty. As so large a part of the details furnished by H. are on religious matters, it may be worth while to sum up here the main points in which his account of Egyptian religion is defective or erroneous (cf. Sourdille, R. pp. 367-401): (1) It quite fails to bring out the importance of certain cults, e.g. of Ptah, of R\u00e2 (the Sun), of H\u00e2pi (the Nile), of Thoth (Hermes, who is only mentioned c. 67, *(erme/w po/lis), of H\u00e2thor (Aphrodite). (2) It has far too much uniformity. H. speaks as if all Egypt had the same beliefs; 'but no people is so destitute of the systematic spirit as the Egyptians.' But cf. 43. 2 n. (3) The religion is made too Greek: a) It is distinctly anthropomorphic; tw)/galma is made everywhere the centre of the temple worship, and H. seems to have conceived of this as usually in human form (46. 2); correspondingly the theriomorphic character of Egyptian religion is underestimated. b) Greek ideas, e. g. of mysteries and oracles, are wrongly introduced. (Some, however, maintain that the Egyptians really had mysteries in the Greek sense of the word; cf. 171. 1 n.) (4) The magic, which is so marked a feature of all Egyptian religion, is ignored. On the other hand, H.'s merits as an observer are now recognized. Erman, the leading German Egyptologist, writes (R. p. 175): 'Where our Egyptian sources fail us, we receive for the first time help from outside; about 450 B.C. H., an indefatigable and careful observer, travelled in Egypt. He observed exactly those things which are of special interest to us.' He proceeds to sketch later Egyptian religion, mainly from the data given by H. (pp. 176-81). ta\\ polla\\ pa/nta, 'in almost all cases.' ai( gunai=kes: the monuments certainly show women marketing and men weaving, but these are the exceptions: H., struck by the contrasts to Greece, forgets to notice they are only occasional in Egypt. kro/khn: the 'woof' pushed home to its place in the warp (sth/mwn by the kerki/s. This was done from below by the Greeks and Romans, and from above by the Jews (cf. John xix. 23, the seamless coat of Christ, 'woven from the top'); the Egyptians used both methods, more usually the latter; H. is so far right, but they also used horizontal looms as well as perpendicular ones. For pictures of weaving see Wilkinson, i. 317; ii. 170 (horizontal), 171. ta\\ a)/xqeaktl.: this contrast is wrong; all that can be said is that some loads were carried by men 'on their heads', e.g. the baker in Gen. xl. 16, while the women probably carried their babies 'on their shoulders', like the modern Fellah\u00een (cf. B. M. G. p. 78). e)sqi/ousi: the Egyptian upper classes certainly did not eat out of doors; H. only saw the Egyptians of the streets. H. is struck by the fact that he heard of no women in Egypt in positions like that of Hera's priestess at Argos, and he (as often) generalizes from a single point. But he himself knew that there were women in the temples, cf.i. 182. 5 n.; ii. 54. 1. He is quite wrong in his statement; two contrary instances may be quoted; women under the Old Empire especially devoted themselves to Neith and Hathor, while under the Saites, the 'consort of Amon' was the nominal ruler of Thebes. Wiedemann has a more elaborate explanation. As the Egyptians called all the dead, men and women alike, 'Osiris', and made them male, he thinks that H. was told this, but misunderstood it, and, transferring it from the other world to the present one, supposed that no woman could appear before the gods as priestess. Wiedemann is very fond of charging H. with confusion; he seems to estimate the historian's capacity by his own. tre/feinktl. Sons at Athens were, as usually in Greece, required to care for their parents; a law of Solon fixed a)timi/a as a penalty for neglecting this duty (Diog. Laert. i. 55). In Egypt the duty of seeing to a parent's grave was certainly imposed on sons; the law in c. 136 implies this. H. is supposed to be referring to the comparative independence of Egyptian women (B. M. G. p. 77), who were able to incur obligations on their own account; struck by this contrast to their dependent position in Greece, he states, in an exaggerated way, that daughters alone had duties to their parents. But this explanation seems very far-fetched. curw=ntai. H. says (37. 2) the priests shaved their whole body every third day; of this there is no evidence on the monuments, but other authorities confirm it (e.g. Diod. iii. 3 (vaguely) and Plut. Mor. 352; de I. et O. 4), and it is probable, in view of the extreme cleanliness of the Egyptians. He is too absolute in saying that all Egyptians shaved (te/ws e)curhme/noi); in fact he himself says (iii. 12. 3) that in few countries are bald men so rare as in Egypt. Probably some classes, e.g. the priests of the New Empire, completely shaved (Erman, E. pp. 218-19), and most had their hair very short. But soldiers wore their natural hair, and so did artists, if we may trust the curious self portrait of Hui (of the time of Amenophis III, eighteenth dynasty, Z. A. S. xlii. 130). keka/rqai. So Achilles (Il. xxiii. 141) cuts off his hair on the death of Patroclus. i(kne/etai: sc.kh=dos, 'whom the grief concerns.' Only the lower classes in Egypt live with animals, and this is true of other countries as well; H.'s generalization is quite wrong. o)/lura. L. & S., s. v., suggest 'rye', but leave the question of its identity with 'spelt', ceia/ (s. v.), open. Wiedemann thinks it = 'durra', which is often represented in the monuments, while 'spelt' is absent from them. H. here (cf. c. 77) again generalizes wrongly from his guide; the lower classes in Egypt eat bread made of 'durra'; wheat and barley were both also used by the upper classes, but (B. M. G. p. 82) wheat only 'rarely' by the lower. *furw=si. The monuments (e.g. the bakery of Rameses III, Erman, E. p. 191; but the work was also done by hand) show us dough being kneaded with the feet, as is still done in the south; Strabo, 823, also confirms the statement as to clay and dough. Dung is still collected for burning in Egypt, and in other eastern countries where wood is scarce. ta\\ ai)doi=a. H. says (with Strabo, 824, and Diodorus), probably rightly (cf.App. IX.4), that all Egyptians were circumcised, Josephus (c. Ap. ii. 13) says only the priests. H. (104. 2, 3 nn.) is certainly wrong in saying that only the Egyptians with the Ethiopians and Colchians, who had learned it from them, practised the rite a)p' a)rxh=s; it was widespread among both Semitic and non-Semitic tribes. Its primitive nature is shown by the use of 'flint knives' (Exod. iv. 25; Josh. v. 2, R. V.). Some scholars hold (with H.) that it was introduced on sanitary grounds (kaqareio/thtos e(/neka); but no doubt originally it was a religious rite, by which a male was initiated as a full member of the nation or clan (cf. Encyc. Biblica, s. v.). The Egyptian evidence, which is comparatively scanty, is well sum marized in Hastings (Enc. Rel. iii. 670-6); the majority of scholars seem to interpret it as showing that the rite was general in Egypt; some, however, think it refers only to the priests. It is curious that only once do the monuments lay any stress on circumcision, i.e. in describing the repulse of the uncircumcised 'peoples of the sea' by Merenptah; even here the interpretation is disputed. e)/xei =fore/ei; in 81. 1 the two garments worn by men are described as a linen kiqw/n round the legs, and a woollen over-cloak. Roughly speaking, this is confirmed by the monuments, but only for members of the lower classes. H. is much too absolute. So far as men are concerned, he omits the cape introduced under the New Empire, and he quite fails to notice that the kiqw/n round the legs was often worn double (Erman, E. pp. 205-7). As to the Egyptian women, it is true that they, down to the eighteenth dynasty, wore only one close-fitting dress; but in H.'s day two, and sometimes three, garments were worn. The servants and the women in the fields, however, wore only one (Erman, E. pp. 212-16). It is from these that H. generalizes. ka/lous: H. is right that the Egyptians fastened the 'sheet' of their vessels (for these cf. c. 96) inside. Torr (p. 80), however, says the ka/los (Att. ka/lws) is a 'brailing rope'; these ran across the sail from the yard. gra/mmata. Egyptian writing is generally from right to left; but in drawing the individual signs they usually began on the left (cf. au)toi/ fasi e)pi\\ decia/). H. is speaking of the direction of the writing as a whole, the natives of the formation of each special letter. He does not mention the older forms of Greek inscriptions, which are from right to left, or boustrofhdo/n, though he must have seen them. There were really three kinds of Egyptian writing: (1) The hieroglyphic, in which the symbols are still recognizable pictures; this was sometimes from left to right, and sometimes up and down (like Chinese). (2) The hieratic, a shortened form of this; a few symbols remain as before, most become purely conventional. (3) The demotic, which developed still further out of the hieratic, and was known by the Egyptians as 'the book script', while the two first were 'the Gods' script'. The enigmatic, which was invented under the eighteenth dynasty, is only a way of writing hieroglyphs in cipher. H. fails to distinguish between (1) and (2), as he well might. For Egyptian writing cf. B. M. G. p. 36 seq., where an interesting account of the decipherment (pp. 41 f.) is given, with a picture of the famous Rosetta Stone. qeosebe/es: the religion (or superstition) of Egypt was proverbial. H. rightly lays stress on their cleanliness and their elaborate ritual. xalke/wn. The Egyptians did use vessels of bronze, but also of gold, silver, glass, &c. H. again generalizes from insufficient data. perlta/mnontai. For shaving and circumcision cf. 36. 1, 3 nn. line/hn. It was forbidden to enter a temple wearing a woollen garment (81. 1); H. is right as to the priests wearing linen and sandals of papyrus. Cf. Exod. xxxix. 27-9 for the linen garments of the Jewish priests. lou=ntai. Chaeremon (fr. 4, F. H. G. iii. 498; an Egyptian priest(?) of Strabo's time, Strabo, 806) says they washed thrice daily; the difference between him and H. may well be due to variety of rituals. The symbol for a priest in the hieroglyphs is a man washing. a)gaqa/. The priestly colleges possessed lands of their own, to the extent (Diod. i. 21) of one-third of all Egypt; from these they and the sacrifices were maintained. H. means by ou)/te . . . dapanw=ntai that no individual priest had to keep himself. For the priests' property and privileges cf. App. X, \u00a7 9, and Erman, E. pp. 298 f. krew=n. Plut. I. et O. 5 says the priests did not eat sheep or swine flesh. oi)=nos. H. says (77. 4) there are no 'vines' in Egypt; here and elsewhere (e. g. cc. 60, 121) he speaks of wine as common. As he mentions the importation of wine (iii. 6. 1) there need be no inconsistency. But certainly the monuments (cf. Erman, E. pp. 198-9) show an extensive cultivation of vines in Egypt, and certain kinds of its wines were famous, e. g. the Mareotic (Hor. Odes, i. 37. 14). Cf., too, Gen. xl. 11; Ps. lxxviii. 47. Probably, therefore, H. is mistaken in c. 77. Others, however (e. g. Brugsch), accept his statement, and argue that the monuments belong to a period before H., and that in his day Greek competition had killed vine-growing in Egypt. This may be partially confirmed by the present state of things there; grapes are still grown, but wine is not made, as 'Egypt is already amply supplied with cheap wines from every part of the Mediterranean' (Baedeker, p. lix). i)xqu/wn. H. is right that the priests were forbidden to eat fish. This food might not be offered in sacrifice; hence the Pythagorean refusal to eat fish may have come from Egypt; for it cf. Plut. Quaes. Conv. viii. 8; Mor. 728 F. But fish was a frequent article of diet among the Egyptians generally, as H. rightly says (77. 4). kua/mous. H. is right that the priests did not eat beans; cf. the Pythagoreans again, Laertius (viii. 24, 34), in speaking of this Pythagorean abstinence, quotes Aristotle as giving various reasons, the most probable of which is that beans ai)doi/ois ei)si\\n o(/moioi. The aversion to beans is supposed by some to have been derived by Pythagoras from Egypt (cf. 123 nn.); but it is common in many primitive civilizations, e. g. in India and in early Rome, where beans were supposed to tend to unchastity, while on the other hand they were especially used in funeral banquets; cf. Plut. Rom. Quaes. 95, the introduction to which (Carabbas Library, by F. B. Jevons, pp. 86-94) has an interesting discussion of the meaning of the superstition; he connects it with 'sympathetic magic'. The Flamen Dialis might neither touch nor name beans; cf. Fowler, Rom. Fest. p. 110. For recent discussions, cf. Gruppe, Myth. Liter. (1908), pp. 370-1. trw/gousi: cf. i. 71. 3, 'munch' (like animals), i. e. things uncooked. a)rxiereu/s. H. is right here; there were grades of rank among the priests; the highest were in later (i.e. Ptolemaic) times the highpriest or prophet, the overseer of the ritual, and the scribe (28. 1). tou/tou o( pai=s. Stein takes this to mean that the son was admitted 'into the college', but 'in the lowest position'. This, however, is not what H. says, and there seem to be clear cases on the monuments of son definitely succeeding father (as other Greeks, e.g. Diod. i. 88, besides H. state). But this was not the rule, and H. as usual generalizes too much. *)epa/fou: i. e. Apis (cf. c. 153), the holy calf of Memphis, by which the god, Ptah-Socharis-Osiris, was represented on earth. H. gives in iii. 28. 2, 3 (cf. a)/llw| lo/gw|, \u00a7 2) an account of his origin and marks. It was from the time of the twenty-sixth dynasty that the Apis-cult became especially important; under the Ptolemies, as Serapis, he was the chief god in Egypt. The Greeks identified him with Epaphus, son of Zeus and Io (cf. Aesch. P. V. 850-1); but, apart from Aelian's contradiction (Hist. An. xi. 10), this is obviously mistaken. An account of the Apis is given in Maspero, pp. 37-9. They were buried in the Serapeum at Memphis, rediscovered by Mariette in 1851-2. Any beast that bore the same marks, e.g. the 'black hair' (Plut. I. et O. 31; Mor. p. 363, says 'white or black'), was holy and could not be sacrificed. So red cattle were properly used as offerings (cf. Numb. xix. 2, the 'red heifer'); but great freedom was allowed, as the monuments show. H.'s account is confused; he seems to mean that no beast could be sacrificed that had black hairs or that had the marks of an Apis; if it had neither of these sacred features it was marked as qu/simon. kaqaro/n here = 'fit to be sacrificed', but below (\u00a7 3) 'without the marks of an Apis'. tetagme/nos. The title of these priests was 'web' (i.e. pure). The sfragisth/s was appointed for the work of inspecting beasts. The tongue of Apis was marked beneath with a 'beetle' (scarabaeus). kata\\ fu/sin: i.e. not 'double', as in an Apis. The 'seal' used to mark the beast was a kneeling man with hands bound and a knife at his throat. (Plut. u. s. p. 363.) shmantri/da: cf. Cic. Verr. Act. ii. 4. 26, 58 for 'cretula' used for seals. a)sh/manton: because the 'unmarked' beast might have been sacred, death was the penalty for killing it. au)tou=: i.e. on the altar; but the Egyptians had no altars in the Greek sense. fe/rousi is superfluous, as it is repeated (fe/rontes) in one of the two parts into which the sentence is resolved. The usage of transferring 'curses' to the head of a sacrificed beast may be illustrated from the Jewish scapegoat (Lev. xvi. 21). Plut. I. et O. 31 mentions it of red oxen, but H. is wrong in supposing it to be part of all Egyptian sacrifices, for in early times the head and the haunch were especially chosen to be placed on the tables of offerings. Hence Erman (R. p. 180) thinks the curse was an innovation, due to foreign (i.e. Semitic) influence, as was also the burning described in 40. 3. a)/llou ou)deno/s. H. is wrong in making the refusal to eat the head universal; but it was sometimes given away (Wilkinson, pl. xi), and it certainly appears less often than other joints (ib. ii. 28). H., in c. 39, has described the libation and the killing which are common (he thinks) to all sacrifices; he now goes on to the 'cleaning out' (e)cai/resis) and the 'burning' which vary; he describes them in the case of a sacrifice to Isis, for to her worship obviously the chapter refers (cf. 61. 1 n.); her festival is the 'greatest' though that of Bast (c. 59. 1) is 'most popular' (proqumo/tatu). tau/thn really refers to o(rth/n, but grammatically to dai/mona. oi( in place of the relative th=|: cf. i. 146. 1 (tw=n and sfi); H. avoids repeating the relative when used in a different case. kateuca/menoi: cf. 39. 2 for imprecations; but kateu/xomai may be used of prayer for blessings. koili/hn: translate 'clean out its belly'; for this sense of e)caire/w cf. 86. 4; 2. kei/nhn = th\\n kei/nou. e)c w)=n ei(=lon. H. (cf. i. 4) often uses this tmesis of the empiric aorist, in describing customs, &c. o)sfu/n.

The cow was the living symbol of Isis-Hathor, represented sometimes as a cow, at others as a woman with a cow's head, at others as a horned woman. She was worshipped all over Egypt (cf. the emphatic pa/ntes o(moi/ws). The Greeks usually identified her with Demeter, but also with other goddesses. Isis is important in the Egyptian pantheon as the sister and wife of Osiris, and mother of Horus. H. is quite right that in Egypt (as among the Hindoos) cows were not sacrificed. Cf. i. 1 for Io's story; H. avoids the usual Greek mistake of confusing her with Isis. Some make 'Io' to be Egyptian = 'the moon goddess', but 'the moon' is masculine in Egyptian. ou)/t' a)nh/r. For the separateness of the Egyptians cf. Gen. xliii. 32, the feast to Joseph's brethren. qa/ptousi. It is wrong to say that dead cows were thrown into the river; this was only done when they were given to crocodiles. On the other hand the heads of oxen are found buried as H. describes. He is wrong in saying they were all removed to Prosopitis (cf. c. 67 for a similar mistake); but his account of the composite burial is clearly confirmed by the mummies, which often contain the remains of several beasts, e.g. one found at Ab\u00fbsir was made up of seven (Maspero, Caus. p. 247). Erman (R. 177) says generally in reference to animal burial 'H. is certainly correct in these in lay between the Canopic and the Sebennytic Niles and a canal, in the south of the Delta. The Greeks made their last stand there, after the suppression of the revolt of Inaros (Thuc. i. 109. 4). Aphrodite corresponds to the Egyptian Hathor; her symbol also was a cow; her chief temple was at Denderah. Her name is probably found in 'Atarbechis', which may well be the *)afrodi/ths po/lis of Strabo (802), in the Prosopitic nome. *dio/s. Originally a local god, Amon became, with the rise of Thebes, the great god of Egypt, and was identified with the sun, as Amon RA. The Greeks therefore naturally called him 'Zeus', and this was the more easy as the ram was sacred to Zeus (cf. Farnell, G. C. i. 94-5). From his oracle at Thebes, which was itself of little importance, was derived that of Zeus Ammon in the oasis of Siwah (cc. 32 n., 55). For Amon's temple at Thebes cf. 143 n. He is occasionally represented as kriopro/swpos (cf. Perrot et Chipiez, i. 395), but it is not his usual form. o(moi/ws. Various as were the cults of Egypt, Osiris and Isis were worshipped everywhere, at any rate in later times, i.e. in the days of H. This was partly due to political influences, i.e. the decline of Thebes which worshipped Amon, and the rise of Sais, partly to the confusion of Osiris with the sun-god (cf. Sourdille, R. 58-62). Osiris was usually identified by the Greeks with Dionysus, but also with Zeus, Hades, Eros, and other gods. The main points of resemblance to Dionysus are: (1) Osiris is originally a corn god (cf. Attis, &c. pp. 268 f.; but Egyptologists doubt this); (2) his mutilation by Set is parallel to that of Dionysus by the Titans; (3) his resurrection cf. Plut. I. et O. c. 35, p. 364 o(mologei= between the Dionysiac *)anqesth/ria and the rites of Osiris; both were a combination of joy and of mourning, of Shrove Tuesday and of All Souls' Day (cf. Maspero, Caus. pp. 276-9, who discusses Foucart's theory that the rites of Dionysus were Egyptian in origin; but against this see Farnell, G. C. v. 174 seq.). For the Osiris myth cf. 62 nn. Mendes lay in the north-east Delta, near the Mendesian arm of the Nile; it was an important seat of the cult of Osiris; for his worship there cf. 46 n. *(hrakle/a. The Egyptian Heracles is variously identified with Shu, the burning sun, or with Chunsu, a moon-god, the god-son of the Theban triad. krio\\n e)kdei/ranta. No native authority confirms H.'s story, which seems to be an attempt to explain the ram-headed figure of Amon. Wiedemann thinks it borrowed from Hecataeus, but there is no reason to believe this. It is not unlikely that the story may be connected with the meaning of the name 'Amon', which = 'the concealed one' (Manetho in Plut. de Is. 9; Mor. 354). At any rate the idea is Greek; so Pythagoras, when initiated in Crete, put on a black fleece (Porphyry V. Pyth.). fwnh/n: 'using a speech between that of the two nations.' Cf. Th. vi. 5. 1 for the full construction. th\\n e)pwnumi/hn e)poih/santo forms one idea, 'called cogn. acc., tou)/noma, cf. kale/etai e)pwnumi/hn (i. 14. 3 n.). Brugsch says this feast is part of the great festival of the Theban Amon, which lasted five days; but there is no evidence on the monuments that the ceremony described by H. took place then. The ceremony seems to rest on the Egyptian idea that a god must die when he has begotten a son; Amon therefore, in the form of his ram, is killed when he has seen his son Heracles. Legrain (R. de T. E. xxviii. 1. 46) found many sheep bones at Karnak, so far confirming H.'s statement. For tu/ptontai to\\n krio/n cf. 40. 4 the 'twelve gods' and the 'eight gods' (\u00a7 4) cf. c. 145 n. To H. the Greek Heracles is a mortal, the son of Amphitryon; he neglects the story that he is son of Zeus, according to his usual practice (cf. vi. 53. 2 n.). He makes the name Egyptian; the usual derivation was 'he to whom Hera gives glory'. H. here does what later was usual among mythologers, i.e. multiplies personalities to explain variant legends; so Varro actually counted forty-three bearers of the name 'Hercules'. oi( qe/menoi for oi(\\ e)/qento, i.e. the poets, Homer and Hesiod (c. 53). oi( gone/es. Heracles' parents were both descended from Aegyptus, brother of Danaus, who came from Egypt (c. 171). For the genealogy and its importance in H.'s chronology cf. App. XIV. 2. The argument is: had the Egyptians learned any divine names from the Greeks, they would have been those of the sea gods, Poseidon and the Dioscuri, but these are unknown to the Egyptian pantheon; a fortiori then it is unlikely that they learned that of 'Heracles'. The words w(/ste tou/twn ... *(hrakle/os restate more strongly the preceding argument. The reign of Amasis, 570-526 B. C., is mentioned, as marking the end of Egyptian independence. This passage is interesting as one of the few in which H. tells us as to himself; we infer from it with some certainty (1) that he was in Egypt before he went to Tyre; (2) that he was a man of wealth, able to travel in pursuit of special knowledge. The Heracles of Tyre is Melcart, the Baal of the O.T., a sun-god. sth=lai. The importance of columns in early worship is well known; cf. Evans, Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult, J. H.

It is impossible to believe in so large a stone; perhaps it was a piece of green jasper or malachite. What is certain is that Wiedemann is wrong, who supposes it to have been a forgery of glass, and this in one of the richest temples of the East! Whether the light was really that of the emerald (as Stein) or due to reflection (as Larcher), can hardly be decided. la/mpontos me/gaqos nu/ktas; but some conjecture seems necessary. a)/llo. This second temple was probably founded by Thasian merchants; for Thasos as a Phoenician colony cf. vi. 47 n. kai/ emphasizes pe/nte: 'at least five'; cf. v. 59 for a similar reckoning of five generations from Cadmus to the period before the Trojan War, and App. XIV. 2. At Sicyon Heracles was worshipped (Paus. ii. 10. 1) both as a god and as a hero, with variant ritual. The Athenians claimed to have first worshipped him as a god (Diod. iv. 39).

H.'s scornful attitude to his countrymen is characteristic; in this book we may compare cc. 2 (rationalization of story of Psammetichus), 16 (as to the boundaries of Egypt), 20-2 (as to the rise of the Nile), 134 (as to Rhodopis), 143 (as to the genealogy of Hecataeus). There is no need to suppose that he is borrowing here from Hecataeus, who expresses a similar view in his genealogies, cf. frag. 332 (F. H. G. *(ellh/nwn lo/goi polloi/ te kai\\ geloi=oi. H. would be especially glad to reject a story attributing human sacrifices to Egypt. o( mu=qos. The story of Busiris, to which H. here refers, occurs first in Pherecydes (Fr. 33, F. H. G. i. 79), and was made by Euripides the subject of a satyric drama; it occurs frequently in classical writers. Busiris is really the name of a town ('house of Osiris'), 59. 1, 61. 1. kata/rxonto: i.e. by cutting the lock of hair. H. seems right in denying that human sacrifices were performed in Egypt in his day; no exact representations of them have been found on the monuments, and the massacre of captives before a god after a victory is only a partial parallel. There are, however, traditions as to them in the past; cf. Diod. i. 88 (there were human sacrifices to\\ palaio/n at the tomb of Osiris) and Porph. De Abstin. ii. 55 (Amosis put down the custom at Heliopolis). Manetho (in Plut. Is. et Os. 73) speaks of human sacrifices 'in the dog-days', but uses the past tense; cf. Frazer, G. B. ii. 255, for their meaning. More valuable evidence still is given by the figures of slaves (Ushabti 'answerers') found in the tombs of the wealthy. (For a fine collection of these in the Ashmolean cf. Guide, p. 87.) No doubt originally the slaves themselves were killed with their masters. Probably the 'Nile bride', a noble maiden, who is said to have been thrown into the Nile annually before the canals were opened (Maspero, i. 24 and n.), was a similar symbolic representation of an old custom. eu)me/neia.

H. and other Greeks (e.g. Diod. i. 84; Pindar v. i.) say the beast was a goat, and they are confirmed by the nome coins (cf. B. M. Cat. Alexandria, p. 347); the monuments, however, show the beast as a ram. Perhaps the monuments are wrong (Sourdille, R. p. 166); cf. the mistake of representing both wolf and dog by a jackal. The beast was the incarnation (not the symbol as H. thinks; cf. ou)/ti toiou=ton) of Osiris, considered as the giver of fruitfulness; so it is called 'the lord of maidens, the begetting ox'. H. is wrong in connecting it with Pan; the confusion is due to the fact that Min of Chemmis (c. 91 n.), whom the Greeks usually identified with Pan, is goat-headed. tou/twn: i.e. he-goats there is one especially honoured, and when he dies, great mourning', &c.; but this is very harsh. a)nafando/n. The 'marvel' was in the openness of the act; the Greeks believed that unnatural intercourse with animals regularly took place in secret at Mendes. The story is as old as Pindar (fr. 215; Strabo, 802). The fact is probably true, and was due to the belief that the ram was the god incarnate (cf. the Jewish prohibitions against such abominations, Lev. xx. 15-16). miaro/n. H. is quite right as to the dislike of swine; they are very little represented on the monuments (but v.i.). e)o/ntes: concessive, 'although they are.' Cf. c. 164 for caste of swineherds. Manetho confirms the fact of this swine offering at a lunat festival. Selene (= 'Nekhebet') was the deity of El Kab, and on a tomb there large herds of swine are mentioned. (Ann. du Service des Antiq. xi. 163). Others suppose that *selh/nh here = Isis; cf. 41. 1 n. for her horns. H. is obscure here; he says that swine's flesh was eaten in honour of Dionysus, but in c. 48 he seems to imply it was sent away uneaten; perhaps then the flesh was eaten in honour of Dionysus and Selene together, but not of Dionysus alone. eu)prepe/steros. For the comparative cf. 46. 2 n.; for the sentiment, i.e. reverential silence, cf. 3. 2 n. Plutarch gives the story (I. et O. c. 8, p. 354) that Typhon was pursuing a pig when he found the coffin of Osiris, and scattered its contents; he says, however, this story was rejected by many, and it is obviously a later invention. katagi/zei (cf. 44. 5 n.) implies that it was a funeral sacrifice, i.e. connected with the dead Osiris. staiti/nas. This offering of symbolic 'dough' cakes is a genuine native custom, and is found elsewhere, e.g. among the Chinese the poor make paper votive offerings (cf. too Plut. Luc. 10 for it at Cyzicus). For such symbolism cf. Tylor, P. C. ii. 405. dorpi/h: the evening meal; hence Schweigh\u00e4user translates 'the eve of the feast'. This was the name of the first day of the Apaturia, which began with a meal at 6 p.m. The Egyptian day began at midnight, not 6 p.m., and Stein translates 'the closing feast' (i.e. the do/rpon here ended, not began, the festival). But H.'s words 'they keep the rest of the feast' imply that he at least thought that the do/rpon came first. For phalli at the Greek Dionysia cf. Farnell, G. C. v. 125, and Aristoph. Ach. 260-1. For their meaning, as assisting the powers of nature by sympathetic magic, cf. E. B.11 s. v.

Melampus was placed in the fourth generation after Hellen. According to later writers he was an Egyptian or had travelled in Egypt; H. does not carry his rationalization of the myth so far. poieu=si ta\\ poieu=si: an euphemism for the obscenities Heraclitus (fr. 127) had called a)naide/stata. susth=sai. H. excludes the miraculous elements of the story (e.g. in Apollodorus i. 9. 11), which make Melampus learn his lore from young snakes and from meeting Apollo. H.'s argument is as follows: the similarity of Dionysiac worship in Greece and Egypt might be explained by three hypotheses (cf. a)\\n h)=n below for one apodosis): (a) the Greeks might have borrowed from the Egyptians; (b) the resemblance might be accidental (cf. sumpesei=n, 'agree by mere chance'); (c) the Egyptians might have borrowed from Greece. Having accepted (a), H. proceeds to refute (b) and (c); (b) is rendered impossible by the facts that Dionysiac rites were not 'like any other Greek rites, o(mo/tropa, and were known to have been 'introduced lately' (newsti/); (c) he rejects recent origin of the rites was shown by legends like those of Lycurgus and of Pentheus; that Dionysus was a later element in the Greek pantheon is usually accepted by scholars; cf. Farnell, G. C. v. 87-92. Cadmus was usually placed three generations earlier than Melampus; he was the grandfather of Dionysus. Perhaps it was this which determined H.'s choice of legend; he wished to make the introduction of the new rite into Greece coincide in time with the birth of the god. Cadmus, as Stein says, was said to be (iv. 147 nn.) a Phoenician, not an Egyptian; but H. obviously thinks Cadmus must have known the rites of Egypt, as it was a neighbour of Tyre; so (c. 116. 1, 2) he proves that Homer knew Paris had been in Egypt, because he mentions his visit to Sidon. kaleome/nhn: cf. Thuc. i. 12. 3 for the Greek tradition that Boeotia did not receive its name till sixty years after the fall of Troy, i.e. long after the time of Cadmus. ou)no/mata. H. does not mean that the actual name came from Egypt; he himself continually mentions the difference of name, e.g. Amon and Zeus (c. 42). But the name of a deity involved his personality, and so H.'s position is that the Greek deities were defined, and their attributes and cult settled, by Egypt; for nameless gods cf. Fowler, Rel. Exp. of Rom. p. 119. H. is merely giving the inferences of himself and others, not genuine tradition; deeply impressed with the antiquity of Egypt, he was prepared to derive everything from it. punqano/menos: e.g. at Dodona (c. 53. 3). H. contrasts his 'inferences' (doke/w) with the results of inquiry. Broadly speaking, H. is right that there are no Egyptian equivalents for these Greek divinities. For Poseidon and the Dioscuri cf. 43. 2; the Egyptians hated the sea, and had no sea deities. H.'s statement is quite inaccurate on one point only; the Egyptian Maa, the goddess of justice, corresponds to Themis. It is true that an inscription at Philae (C. I. G. 4893) equates Hera with Satis and Hestia with Anukis; but Satis is really quite unimportant in the Egyptian pantheon, and Anukis is only important in Upper Egypt. For the Libyan origin of Poseidon cf. iv. 188. nomi/zw is here used with dative on analogy of xra/omai. H.'s statement as to the absence of hero worship is accurate only in the sense that there was no subordinate order of demigods in the Egyptian pantheon corresponding to the Greek h(/rwes. But for the birth of mortals from gods cf. c. 143 n., and the god, Imhotep, whom the Greeks identified with their Asclepius, had been actually a physician under the third dynasty. *(erme/w. The ithyphallic Hermes, as a god of fruitfulness, was represented at the street corners in Athens (Thuc. vi. 27. 1); Pausanias (iv. 33. 4) says the rest of Greece learned this form of statue from the Athenians. It is true that there were no such statues in Egypt. For H.'s views on the Pelasgians cf. App. XV; he uses the name here of the later Pelasgian settlement in Attica (as in i. 57. 2), not of the original Pelasgian inhabitants of Greece. These later Pelasgians began to be considered Greek after their settlement in Attica; the Athenians 'already ranked as Greeks' (for telei=n e)s 1). The Cabiri (cf. Daremberg and Saglio, s.v.) are one of the most difficult subjects in mythology. The name is probably connected with kai/w = 'the burners'; so Aeschylus' tragedy on the subject seems to have borne the name of *ka/eiroi. Others connect the name with a Semitic root = 'mighty', and derive the Greek Cabiri from those of Phoenicia, which became familiar to the Greeks as the figureheads of galleys. (So Bloch in Rosch. ii. 2540.) But the Phoenician Cabiri were eight in number, those of Greece vary from two to four. Probably then the Cabiri belong to the early stages of Greek religion and are in this sense rightly called 'Pelasgic'. They were worshipped in many places. e.g. Lemnos, Thebes (cf. Frazer, v. 136 seq., for their temple there), as local genii, subordinate to the Olympian gods; so H. makes them (iii. 37) the 'sons of Hephaestus'. But in Samothrace they had remained 'cosmic deities of the first rank', and were identified with Hermes and Hephaestus. As the symbol of the ithyphallic Hermes shows, they were connected with fruitfulness. Some have identified the Cabiri with the Phoenician *pata/i+koi (iii. 37. 2 n.), also used as figure-heads, but H. expressly distinguishes them, in spite of their likeness. He had obviously been himself initiated in their mysteries (cf. Aristoph. Pax 277-8). pro/teron: i.e. before they were driven out by the Samians (Strabo, 457). ta/ in loose apposition to lo/gon. The obscene story is referred to Cic. de Nat. Deor. iii. 22. The Pelasgi worshipped divine powers, without having definite names for them (cf. 50. 1 n.), e.g. the sun, but not Apollo. So Preller (Rom. Myth. i. 48, 3rd ed.) says of early Roman religion, 'most of the names of the oldest Roman gods have such a shifting indefinite meaning that they can hardly be regarded as proper names'; he quotes this passage in illustration. e)/quon de\\ pa/nta: translate 'in all their offerings called on gods'. qeou/s. H. forgets that he himself had proved (i. 57. 2) that the Pelasgi were ba/rbaron glw=ssan i(e/ntes; his derivation from the root of ti/qhmi is as worthless as that of Plato (Crat. 397 D) from the root of qe/w (I run). For the oracle of Zeus at Dodona cf. Il. xvi. 233*zeu= a)/na, *dwdwnai=e, *pelasgike/ (cf. App. XV. 2). It was admittedly the oldest in Greece; this fact is one of the arguments for the view that the Greeks entered their country from the north-west, not from the east. For the oracle cf. P. Gardner (N. C. Gk. H. c. 14), Frazer (ii. 159-60), and Farnell (G. C. i. 38 seq.). Zeus, who is prominently an oracular god nowhere else in Greece proper, had the titles of *na/ios (i.e. a rain spirit) and *eu)/dendros, i.e. he lives in the tree and speaks in its rustling. (For tree-worship cf. Tylor, P. C. ii3, p. 218; and Evans, J. H. S. 1901.) This chapter is most interesting for estimating H.'s own views. It is clear that: (1) he has definite opinions as to chronology; Homer and Hesiod are contemporaries and four hundred years before his own day. (2) He recognizes the importance of Homer and Hesiod as fixing the canon of Greek mythology. Cf. his predecessor Xenophanes is not fair to blame H. (as Strabo does, 43) for not distinguishing the systematic theogony of Hesiod from the poetic treatment of Homer; this distinction is irrelevant to his point of view here. (3) He clearly distinguishes them from the other epic poets (cf. c. 117). But on the other hand it is equally clear that: (1) his date is his own, not based on tradition nor universally accepted; (2) he does not realize that Homer and Hesiod simply gave form to ideas which had been gradually taking shape before their time, and that they embodied former lays in their works; (3) still less has he any doubts of the historic reality of the events described by the poets. To sum up, his opinions have no objective value for the solution of the Homeric question, interesting though they are as showing the ideas of an educated Greek in the fifth century. e)pwnumi/as: i.e. patronymics, e.g. *kroni/dhs, local names, &c. Others make a contrast between qeogoni/hn (Hesiod) and e)pwnumi/as ktl. (Homer), explaining e)pwnumi/as as = such epithets as glaukw=pis; but this seems forced. For the whole point cf. i.e. c. 52, as opposed to his own special views in this chapter (53). H. is careful to distinguish tradition from his private inference (cf. emphatic e)gw/). Sourdille (H.E. 184) well summarizes the differences between Greek and Egyptian oracles, of which H. is quite unconscious. (1) All Egyptian gods, not seven (cf. c. 83) only, could prophesy; (2) but their responses were for king or priest, as representing the people, not for all, as in Greece; (3) nor had they a special mantei=on, apart from their ordinary temple. The oracles H. speaks of in Egypt were those of Greek settlers. xrhsthri/wn. H. proceeds from the Greek gods to the Greek oracles; some of these also in Greece he thinks of Egyptian origin. The story which he gives of the founding of Dodona is a rationalization of the myth (given in c. 55). Sayce maintains (J. of P. xiv. 275) that the 'priests in Thebes' that H. talked with were 'ciceroni' connected with some temple of the Theban Amun in the north of Egypt, and that H. never was in Thebes itself. Though there is no reason to doubt H.'s veracity, the story is clearly of Greek origin; H. may have heard it in Greece, and his guides would answer in the affirmative all his 'leading questions'; the mention of 'Phoenician robbers' is certainly more suited to Greeks than to natives of Upper Egypt. But Sourdille (E. pp. 175-89) thinks that there was probably a Greek community at Thebes, which had set up an oracle professing to be that of the Theban god (cf. 57. 3 n.); to this H. applied, thinking in all good faith that it was native (cf. the repeated emphasis laid on his informants, 54. 1, 55. 1), though it was really Greek. The story as to the 'priestesses' is an attempt to turn myth into history; it substitutes natural causes for the supernatural ones, which were, to those among whom the myths grew up, the real essence of the narrative. For a criticism of such rationalizing in H. and in Thucydides cf. Grote, i. 381 seq. proma/nties. In Homer (Il.xvi. 235) those in charge of the oracle are men, u(pofh=tai; Strabo (329) says women were appointed later. fhgo/n: cf. 57. 3 n. H. seems to have met these priestesses himself. Cf. Intr. p. *qesprwtou/s. th=s au)th=s tau/ths emphasizes the fact that the country was the same though the name changed; cf. i. 144. 1. pefukui/h|: the 'natural' oak is a feature in all the stories. kathgh/sato. The change to oratio recta is odd. peleia/da. 'To speak like a bird' was a Greek expression for speaking unintelligibly. of Cleophon. Various suggestions are made to explain H.'s unusual rationalism; there is supposed to be a reference to the fact that the aged were called in Epirus pe/leioi (Hesych.); others suggest that the priestesses were called 'doves' metaphorically (cf. the title me/lissai for the priestesses of Ephesian Artemis), and that the myth grew up to explain the title. Such suggestions are ingenious but unnecessary. H.'s conjectures are quite in accordance with Hellenic ideas, and also quite valueless. At Dodona the voice of Zeus was heard in the leaves of the oak; at Thebes the wind blew always in a prophetic grotto except for one day in each month (Hellan. fr. 152; F. H. G. i. 66). i(rw=n. There were two kinds of divination from sacrifices, viz. di) e)mpu/rwn and i(eroskopi/a (watching the fire and examining the entrails); no trace of either has been found in Egypt. H. proceeds to another borrowing, that of processions, &c. There are many points of resemblance between the religious festivals of Greece and of Egypt. An important part of these in the latter country were the processions (pompai/) in which the image of the deity was taken to visit (prosagwgai/) another deity; others explain prosagwgh/=pro/sodos, i.e. the procession to the temple with sacrifices, &c. For the whole cf. Claudian (de Quar. the divination be like or not, 'at all events' the festivals have much in common. H. now proceeds (cc. 59-63) to describe six famous festivals: these were celebrated throughout all Egypt on the same day (62.2); but every district in Egypt had its special festivals. The fact that H. says nothing of the festival of the rising of the Nile is urged (Sourdille, E. p. 7) with good reason as showing that he arrived in Egypt after the inundation had begun; cf. 19. 2n. ou)k a(/pac. H. shows the inferiority of Greece; there, of the four great festivals, the Olympian and the Pythian came once in four years, and the Isthmian and Nemean twice in the same period, i.e. only six festivals in four years. Bubastis,hod. Tell Basta (1/4 mile south of Zagazig), was a town in the East Delta on the Pelusiac Nile. It was the capital of the twenty-second dynasty. H. obviously had a weakness for it (cf. 40. 1 n.); he calls its temple 'the most attractive' that he knew (137. 5); cf. also 154. 3 for the planting of the Greek mercenaries near. The goddess worshipped here was Bast; H. and other classical writers give her the name of her town, instead of her own. He wrongly identifies her with Artemis; she had more in common with Aphrodite, e.g. in the licentious nature of her festival (60. 2). She was represented with the head of a cat, like Pacht in Middle Egypt, and Sechemt at Thebes and Memphis. No confirmation is found on the monuments for this feast at Bubastis; but there was a similar one for five days, in the month Thoth, at Denderah, the details of which correspond closely to the description here. The kro/tala and flutes are genuine Egyptian instruments; kro/tala='rattles'; others translate 'cymbals'; H. does not mention the sei=stron, which is the most common of all. Clapping of hands, to mark time, was as common in ancient as it is in modern Egypt. kai/ makes the figure more emphatic (cf. 44. 4). The number is exaggerated; Wiedemann well compares the 70,000 pilgrims who, according to Mohammedan belief, go to Mecca every year, and whose number is made up by angels, if it would otherwise fall short. Busiris. There were several places of this name, i.e. 'town of Osiris'. H. (59. 2) says this one was 'in the midst of the Delta', i.e. he probably means the capital of the Busiris nome, on the left bank of the Sebennytic Nile. pro/teron. Cf. c. 40; for tu/ptontai cf. 40. 4; it takes an accus. ad sensum here as in 42. 6. to/n: Osiris, whom (as usual, cf. 86. 2; 132. 2) H. does not name. The Carians were the mercenaries of Psammetichus (152. 5). They may have brought the usage of self-mutilation into the Egyptian rite; cf. for it the 'prophets of Baal' at Mount Carmel (1 Kings xviii. 28); it was expressly forbidden to the Jews (Lev. xix. 28). The ruins of Sais lie near S\u00e2 el Hagar, about half a mile east of the Rosetta Nile. Neith, 'the mother of the sun,' who was especially worshipped at Sais, was identified with Athena; like her, she has for emblems (on the coins of the Saitic nome) an owl on her right hand and a lance in her left. Her worship spread widely under the twenty-sixth dynasty, when Sais was the capital of Egypt. In her attributes and her representation on the monuments she is another form of Isis; hence her feast, here described by H., is a part of the mourning for Osiris (like that at Busiris, c. 61). ta\\ lu/xna. For this 'feast of lamps' cf. Plut. I. the 19th of Athyr (November) the body of Osiris is found with loud notes for references). The lights, then, are to assist the goddess in her search; the story is splendidly used by Milton in the Areopagitica, where he compares the search for Truth to the search of Isis for Osiris. Others, however, see in the 'lights' simply a reference to Osiris as 'lord of the (B\u00e4hr). the 'feast of lights' with another Osiris feast, that in the month Choiak, at the time of the winter solstice. Cf. Inscrip. of Denderah, R. T. E. et A. iii. 49, iv. 27 for the '34 boats' and their '365 lights'. As the feast described by H. is clearly connected with Osiris, either of these views is more probable than that of Maspero (p. 794), that it is the Egyptian 'All Souls Day' (the 17th of Thoth) that is here referred to. The festivals of cc. 61 and 62, though both Osiris feasts, are probably distinct from each other. e)mba/fion: a 'vessel' full of salt steeped with oil; hence the wick burned slowly. It seems better to explain it thus than to suppose a reference to the oil of the silliku/pria (c. 94), which is separated from the moisture it contains by the use of salt (cf. Plin. xv. 25 'sine igni et aqua sale aspersum exprimitur'). For the story of Osiris cf. Plut. I. et O. cc. 13-19 and Erman, R. p. 32 seq. (mainly from Egyptian sources). It is, briefly, as follows (the references in H. ii are inserted after each point): Osiris, the beneficent ruler and civilizer, was killed by his brother Set (Typhon). (For Osiris' pa/qea cf. c. 171.) His wife, Isis, set out to search for his body, leaving her son, Horus (Apollo), at Buto to be protected from Set (c. 156). The body of Osiris was found, but Set again obtained possession of it, and cut it into fourteen pieces, which were only rediscovered by Isis after long and patient search (cf. cc. 47, 48, 62 nn.). Wherever she found a part she erected a tomb; but the various members were reunited, and restored magically to life by the jackal god Anubis. As Osiris, however, could not rule a second time on earth, he became lord of the other world, Amenti, 'the hidden place' (cf. cc. 86 n., 123). His son, Horus, after a long struggle, defeated Set (iii. 5) and reigned in his stead (c. 144) Almost all these points are referred to by H., but always with reserve (cf. c. 3 n.). It is noticeable that H. thinks of Osiris as buried at Sais (c. 171), and never even mentions Abydos in Upper Egypt, which was especially considered his tomb, and where, accordingly, wealthy Egyptians had themselves buried, filotimoume/nous o(mota/fous ei)=nai tou= sw/matos *)osi/ridos (Plut. u. s. c. For the whole Osiris myth in H. cf. Sourdille (R. c. 3, especially pp. 87-9). Buto, a town in the north-west Delta on the Sebennytic Nile, was probably near the village of Ibtu; cf. Petrie (E. E. F. xxvi. (1904-5) pp. 36-8); it was famous for its oracle (cf. cc. 152, 155). Leto is the Egyptian Uat, the patron deity of the Lower Delta. Papremis (cf. cc. 71, 165 for the 'nome' of Papremis) was the site of the battle in 460 B. C., when Inaros defeated Achaemenes (iii. 12.4); its exact position is uncertain, but Sourdille (E. p. 90 seq.) shows that probably it was the original native town which was absorbed later by the Greek Pelusium (so Rhakoti was absorbed by Alexandria). His arguments, briefly, are: (1) identity of position; Papremis was on the Egyptian frontier, on or near the Nile (Diod. xi. 74); H. says Pelusium is 'the entrance' into Egypt from the east (141. 4, the story of Sethos); (2) the Coptic name of Pelusium is 'Peremoun', which may well be derived from Papremis; (3) phlou/sion is a Greek adjective, and was probably the name of the settlement of the mercenaries in the territory of Papremis (cf. 165 n.). It is noticeable that H. never calls Pelusium a 'town'. H. says the god worshipped here was Ares (59. 3); whom he means is uncertain. Some explain 'Ares' as the Egyptian Anhur (Greek *)/onouris), the son of Ra; he stands in Ra's boat, and clears his course of snakes and hippopotami; his title was 'foe-smiter'. More probably, however, Ares=a form of Set, i.e. Typhon (Sourdille, R. p. 188 seq.); for (1) they have a common character of violence. (2) The hippopotamus, sacred in Papremis only (c. 71), was the symbol of Typhon (Plut. I. et O. 50); of it the Greeks said th=| mhtri\\ bi/a| mi/gnusqai, which explains the story told by H. below. (3) Papremis was somewhere in the north-east Delta, near the Serbonian Lake (cf. iii. 5 n.). e)pi\\ ta\\ e(/tera: i.e. opposite those in the entrance. Transference of 'shrines' of this kind is represented on the monuments, both on men's shoulders and (as H. says) on 'four-wheeled wagons'. Erman (E. pp. 278-9) quotes a picture from a grave at Thebes, commemorating the return to life of Osiris, in which the ceremony is followed by a battle (plhgh/n) as here; cf., for similar car-battles in north-west India, J. R. A. S., 1884, p. 29. ou)de/na. For a similar miraculous escape from wounds in a religious ceremony cf. iv. 180. 2. a)po/trofon: i.e. brought up apart from his mother. The story may be an explanation of the Egyptian title 'ka-mutf', i.e. husband of his mother, applied to Amon and other gods; but probably it is a Greek invention (v.s.). summei=cai, coitum habere; cf. iv. 114. 1; the sense elsewhere in H. is colloqui (e.g. iv. 151. 2). He probably uses an ambiguous word designedly, though the sensus obscenus is clear. H. fears that the story which he has just told may lead to depreciation of Egyptian morals; he therefore hastens to point out that they do not practise such rites as those of Mylitta (i. 199; though even there e)/cw tou= i(rou=, \u00a7 3). He is right in his general statement, but there were exceptions; cf. i. 182 n. (at Thebes). The reason he gives for the licence of other countries is a Greek speculation; he does not understand the real meaning of the impure Semitic rites (for which cf. i. 7. 4 n.; ii. 48. 2 n.). Animals were supposed to act on direct impulse from the gods, and to show their will (Tac. Germ. 10). This mention of animals skilfully forms the transition to the next division of H.'s work (cc. 65-76), the account of the 'Sacred Beasts'. e)ou=sa: concessive; for the beasts of Libya cf. iv. 191. Egypt is comparatively free from beasts, owing to the extent of cultivated land and the small amount of waste. e)o/nta agrees with qh/ria understood from qhriw/dhs. Strictly taken the words mean that all beasts were sacred everywhere in Egypt; but this is absurd, and inconsistent with H.'s own details. The respect paid varied from nome locus'. H. quite fails to distinguish the various kinds of animal worship (Sourdille, R. p. 235 seq.): (1) animals worshipped by individuals as fetiches. Of this class there is little evidence, though no doubt such worship was widely spread among the lower classes; (2) individual animals supposed to be gods incarnate. Cf. c. 46 (the goat at Mendes); iii. 27-8 (Apis at Memphis; (3) whole classes of animals sacred to a god. Strabo, 803, distinguishes these clearly, qeoi\\ me\\n ou) nomi/zontai i(eroi\\ de/. Most of H.'s details refer to (3). For animal worship in general cf. 75. 3 n. a)nei=tai: properly 'are let go'; hence a)ni/hmi is used either with i(ro/s (as here) or without (cf. Plato, Leg. 761 C a)/lsos a)neime/non = 'consecrated'). feu/gw: cf. for this reserve 3. 2 n. The office of 'caretaker' of the beasts was certainly not always hereditary: H. is too absolute. eu)xa/s. The 'vows' are obviously for the restoration of children's health; so Diodorus (i. 83) understood this passage; he mentions the various kinds (not 'fish' only) of food given to the beasts, and that land was set apart for their maintenance. Rob. Smith (Kinship2, p. 179; Rel. Sem. p. 330) compares the Arabian sacrifice ('acica') at birth of a child, when its head was shaved and a sheep sacrificed for it; by devoting its hair it was admitted into the family. to\\ d'. The antecedent for this is tou/tou understood with h( zhmi/h. i)=bin. Cic. Tusc. v. 27, 78 implies that it was a capital offence to kill an ibis, a snake, a cat, a dog, or a crocodile. Diodorus (i. 83 ad fin.), who was himself present, relates that Ptolemy Auletes was unable to save from death a Roman who had unintentionally killed a cat, although he and his people alike were at the time most anxious for Roman friendship. H.'s good sense suggests the difficulty that animals protected so strictly would multiply unduly, and to meet this he accepts an explanation which, though fictitious in itself, is based on two rightly observed natural facts; these are that it might be thought, from the noise she makes, that the process of impregnation is painful to a she-cat, and that tom-cats do in some cases kill their young, if they seem to attract the mother's attention too much. It is quite true that cats will run into a burning house. e)sa/llontai . . . tau=ta de\\ gino/mena. This should either absolute or the sentence should end toi=s *ai)gupti/ois e)sti; but the events described in the participle gino/mena and in the verb katalamba/nei are looked on as identical (cf. vii. 157. 2 a(lh\\s me\\n ktl.). curw=ntai: H. forgets his own generalization (36. 1) that the Egyptians, unlike other men, let their hair grow in bereavement. For Bubastis cf. 59. 1. A great cemetery has been excavated there, with many bronze figures representing cats, and also cats' skeletons; but they were very rarely mummified there (Naville, Bubastis, p. 54); H. is right that dead cats were transferred, but it is not true that all cats were brought to Bubastis, for similar cemeteries have been found at Sakkara, at Beni Hasan, and elsewhere; the mummied cats at Beni Hasan were brought to Europe a few years ago and sold as manure. Cats were honoured all over Egypt in ancient times as they are to this day. H. makes a like exaggeration as to 'sparrow-hawks' (i)/rhkas) and 'ibises', the mummies of which have been found in many places besides Buto and Hermopolis; he himself (c. 65 ad fin.). implies that these were sacred birds everywhere. ku/nas. Dogs, wolves, and jackals were sacred to Anubis, the dogheaded god, who was (like Hermes) yuxopompo/s; hence a jackal is often represented as guarding the door of Hades. Mummied dogs have been found at various places, but at Cynopolis, the chief centre of their worship, the great majority of the mummies are of jackals; H. puts the three kinds together. For the worship of 'ichneumons' and 'field-mice' (mugala=s) cf. Strabo, 812, 813; it is confirmed by the monuments. i)/rhkas. The 'sparrow-hawk' was specially honoured in Egypt; it was sacred to the sun; Osiris also is represented by a sparrowhawk. So, later, its picture stood for 'god' in the hieroglyphs. *(erme/w = Egyptian Thoth; his chief city, Hermopolis, was near the modern Ashmun\u00ean, some 180 miles south of Cairo; there were others of the same name. Many ibis mummies have been found there. a)/rktous. The bear only appears on the monuments as a present from foreign nations. As, however, it certainly was found in North Africa, Sayce is not justified in saying 'it did not exist in Egypt', still less in gratuitously suspecting H. of confusing it with the hyena. A 'bear' of the archaic period is figured in B. M. G. (p. 86). H. is right that the Egyptian wolf is much smaller than the European variety. For the supposed borrowing by H. in this chapter and in cc. 70, 71, 73 from Hecataeus cf. Introd. pp. 22-6. It has been thought that the style in cc. 68, 69 resembles that of c. 73, and 'shows the epitomator' (C. M\u00fcller, ad Hecat. Fr. 294; F. H. G. i. 22). But, if Porphyry's statement be worth anything, it implies that the description of the crocodile is not borrowed, since only 'the capture' of it is mentioned by him. Full of marvels as H.'s account is, he is moderate compared to his successors, e.g. Seneca (Nat. Quaes. iv. 2. 13) tells a marvellous story, on the authority of an eyewitness, the Roman prefect Balbillus (Tac. Ann. xiii. 22), of a battle between crocodiles and dolphins at the Heracleot mouth of the Nile. mh=nas. The crocodile does not hibernate; but it is much less seen in the winter, when apparently it lives for long periods without food. to\\ pollo/n. H. is quite right here; the crocodile sleeps on shore by day in the summer. Aristotle's description (H.A. v. 33, 558 a 17-24) is worth comparing with of the latter part of the passage is borrowed, in several cases verbally, from H. Aristotle (ib. i. 11) also repeats the statement as to the crocodile 'not moving its under-jaw', and (ib. 9. 6) the account of the troxi/los; the verbal similarities are not so marked in these passages. In ii. 10 Aristotle inserts most of H.'s other particulars, i.e. as to the crocodile's habits by day and night, as to its eyes and teeth, and as to its claws and skin. In this last passage the resemblance is again most marked. For the relations of H. and Aristotle on this subject cf. Diels, Hermes, xxii. 430-2, where the passages are given in full. e(ptakai/deka. Some ancient writers give even larger estimates, e.g. Phylarchus (fr. 26, F.H.G. i. 340) speaks of one just over forty feet. The Nile crocodile only reaches fifteen feet in length, but further east another species is often over twenty feet long, while one monster of thirty-three feet is on record; E. B.11 vii. 479. glw=ssan. The tongue of a crocodile is very small; it is more accurate to say with Pliny (N.H. viii. 89) 'linguae usu caret'. like that as to 'no tongue', was often made in antiquity, but is of course wrong; the crocodile raises its head to bite, and so presents the deceptive appearance of moving its upper jaw. tuflo/n. Aristotle (u.s.) corrects to fau/lws; both statements are wrong, for the crocodile sees excellently in water. troxi/los. The service rendered by the troxi/los seems to be a genuine piece of native information. There are no leeches in the Nile, but eyewitnesses say that the 'Spurwing' actually does pick flies and other morsels out of the crocodile's mouth. Curzon (Monasteries of Levant, p. 150) says he has seen a crocodile warned of danger by a kind of plover ('ziczac'). For the whole subject cf. letters in Spectator, Feb. 13 and 20, 1909. The troxi/los became a proverb for those who serve the great through fear, P. G. ii. 691. The crocodile was sacred to Sebak or Sobk, who was represented with a crocodile head. As the calf Apis was the incarnation of Ptah, so was the sacred crocodile, *sou=xos, at Arsinoe (called by the Greeks 'Crocodilopolis') in the Fay\u00fbm, an incarnation of Sebak. (Cf. Strabo, 811-12, for an account of a visit to this creature and how it was fed.) The crocodile was worshipped at many other places, but H. is right in mentioning specially 'those that dwell round Thebes and L. Moeris', and in making the people of Elephantine especially hostile (but see Sayce, J. of P. xiv. 268-9). a)rth/mata. The holes bored for these 'pendants' can still be seen in the skulls of mummied crocodiles. li/qos xuth/ was a kind of glass, an older name for u(/alos. qh/kh|si. The labyrinth (ii. 148. 5) was built partly for the burial of the sacred crocodiles. The most extensive finds of mummied crocodiles have been near Monfal\u00fbt, some 220 miles south of Cairo. The Egyptians called the crocodiles 'em-suh' ('that which is born of the egg'); hence the name xa/mya, in which the aspirate has become prefixed. For the Ionic name, kroko/deiloi, cf. alligator, i.e. the Spanish al lagarto ('the lizard'). For the bearing of cc. 70, 71 on the relations of H. and Hecataeus cf. 68. 1 n., and Intr. cf. 40. 2 n. In spite of its sacredness the crocodile was hunted in some places, e.g. at Tentyra (Ael. N. H. x. 21). Crocodiles are now seen only occasionally, even as high up as Abu Hammed, i.e. above the Third Cataract (Baedeker, p. 322). The hippopotamus now is not seen north of the Third Cataract, but the monuments show that it was once found even in the Delta; Hogarth (A. A. L. p. 100) says there is good evidence for one having been killed there in 1818, and traditions of it still survive in the marshes. H. is wrong in his negative statement, for it was a sacred animal in some places, e.g. Thebes, though hated in others as the symbol of Set (Typhon); there seems no other trace of its connexion with Paprensis. Of H.'s description it can at best be said that it is highly impressionist. The hippopotamus has not a 'cloven hoof', nor has it a 'horse's mane' and 'tail' (it really is almost hairless); and it is much bigger than an ox. But its teeth are prominent, the lower ones are often over five feet long, and it is certainly simo/s. The resemblance to a horse can be well seen in Dugmore's photographs (p. 90, Camera Adventures, 1910). H., or his informant, however, must have had a very flying glimpse of behemoth. Aristotle (502 a, 9-15), H. A. ii. 7, copies H.'s account almost verbally without naming him; he corrects him by substituting ke/rkon u(o/s for the 'horse's tail', and by half-concealing the tusks (u(pofainome/nous); on the other hand he says that the hippopotamus is only 'as big as an ass', which is a change for the worse. custo/n is the part, 'the shaft,' a)ko/ntion the whole. The hide was more frequently used for whips, the well-known 'Kurbash', and for shields. e)nu/dries: perhaps = a kind of ichneumon; 'otters' are not found in the Nile. Strabo (812) says that the 'Lepidotus' was honoured by 'all the Egyptians alike', with cows, dogs, cats, sparrow-hawks, and ibises. It was also called kupri=nos='carp'. Wilkinson thinks it=the 'dogfish' of the Nile. e)/gxelun: there is no trace on the monuments of the 'eel' being considered holy; but the Greeks certainly jested at the Egyptians' respect for it, e.g. Anaxandrides (in Athen. 299; cf. 35 n.). xhnalw/pekas. The 'vulpanser' was sacred to Keb (who was compared to the Greek *kro/nos), the god of the earth. Mummies of it have been found at Thebes. The account of the phoenix is one of the passages which Porphyry says was stolen by H. from Hecataeus (cf. c. 68 n.). The phoenix is usually said to correspond to the 'bin' (or 'bennu') of Egyptian theology. It was represented on the monuments as a 'heron', and was the symbol of the rising sun, and also of the resurrection. It was especially reverenced at Heliopolis. Round this symbolic bird grew up a great mass of myth (cf. e.g. Plin. N. H.x.2; Tac. Ann. vi. 28). H. reproduces one specimen of this, but expressly says that he does not believe it. The later and more familiar form of the story is that the phoenix came to Heliopolis and burned itself on the altar, and that from the ashes the new phoenix arose; it was this myth which was used by the Fathers to illustrate the Resurrection (cf. Clemens Rom. ad Cor. i. 25-6). Manilius (in Plin. u. s.) connected the life of the phoenix with the 'great year' (of 540 years), after 540 years' 'interval', Tacitus (u. s. 500, but says some gave 1,461 years, i.e. a 'Sothic period' (cf. c. 4 nn.); there is no trace of these huge figures on the monuments. It need hardly be said that the phoenix became a proverb for age (P. G. ii. 712). The bennu of the monuments has not these gorgeous colours, which Pliny (u.s.) repeats; some suppose that H. is confusing it with a golden pheasant. Sayce says this passage proves that H. had never seen the monuments; it only proves that H., like other men, made mistakes. perih/ghsin, 'outline.' It is impossible to say where H. got his idea of the likeness to the eagle. *)arabi/hs: i.e. the region of the rising sun, where myrrh is found (iii. 107). H. here speaks of the cerastes, a snake about two feet long; it has been found mummied at Thebes. Maspero (M. A. E. ii. 405) says a serpent was looked on by the lower classes at Thebes as the embodiment of Miritskro (Merseker), goddess of healing; H. may have been misled by this into calling it not venomous, which is quite wrong. *boutou=n: this is not the Buto mentioned in cc. 59, 63 (which was in the North-west Delta). It is doubtfully identified with Amt, near Tanis, in the North-east Delta (E. E. F. v. 37, for 1888); here Uto (Uat) was certainly worshipped. But Sourdille (E. p. 76 seq.) argues ingeniously that the words here show Buto was outside the Delta (in 'Arabia') and off H.'s main route. He thinks that H. conceives the serpents as coming from the south, and turning west, through 'a pass' (e)sbolh/), along the line of the canal described in 158. 2-3. Hence he places Buto somewhere near the Bitter Lakes. The 'great plain' of \u00a7 2 then is that north of the Wadi Tum\u00eel\u00e2t (158. 2 n.). pterwtw=n. The 'winged snakes' are mentioned again in iii. 107 as guarding the frankincense trees; cf. for the belief in them, Isaiah xxx. 6, where 'the viper and the fiery flying serpent' are mentioned among the terrors of the 'land of trouble and anguish' to the south. Probably the snakes are a reality; Strabo says the region near the Bitter Lakes was full of serpents, which lay hid in the sand; but their 'wings' are a mere traveller's tale. Sayce supposes that H. is trying 'to give probability and local colouring by telling the tale in the first person; he compares the valley of the roc in the Arabian Nights. But H. simply says that he saw a number of snake bones piled up, the rest of the story is what he was told. Other explanations are (1) that of Brugsch, that 'locusts' are meant. The ibis certainly kills locusts; but in no other point does the explanation fit H.'s statements. (2) The story is supposed to have a mythological origin. The goddess of Buto was represented as a snake with hood inflated and with wings; but the representation is certainly not that of a 'watersnake' nor are its wings 'like those of bats' (76. 3). (3) Sourdille (E. p. 75) suggests that the tree-lizard of the East, which has a collar which it expands, was once found in the region east of Egypt, and may be the 'winged snake'. Whether the sacred ibis really kills snakes or not is disputed; at all events the Greeks thought that it did. Cf. Diod. i. 87 (also 86) for this and other explanations of animal worship; he gives a list of creatures worshipped by the Egyptians because they were useful; cats and ibises are both mentioned as killing snakes. It need hardly be said that this explanation of animal worship is an afterthought; its origin is to be sought in the superstitions of primitive peoples (cf. 65. 1 n). Sourdille (R. p. 251) sums up (with regard to H.'s account of the worship of animals): 'the striking point is not the inaccuracy of the points related; a great number of them agree with what appears to have been the case; but they are too generalized, too systematized' (cf. 67. 1 nn.). H. is singularly accurate in his description of the two kinds of ibis (cf. E. B.9s. v.), but is wrong in saying that the black kind was the sacred one: the Ibis religiosa is not all black, but white with a black head, neck, &c., as H. describes the common ibis. The black ibis only appears to be black at a distance; seen close, it is dark chestnut in colour, with a brilliant gloss in parts. Strabo says the sacred ibis was in his day a perfect nuisance in the streets of Alexandria. kre/c: the 'corncrake' is really smaller than the ibis.

Egypt): 'The climate of Egypt, being remarkably equable, is healthy to those who can bear great heat': the daily range of temperature in the Libyan desert is 35\u00b0, but in Egypt the range is less (Baedeker, p. lx). Even in classical times, consumptive patients were sent to Egypt (cf. Pliny (the younger) Epis. v. 19, who sends his freedman Zosimus). a)rtofage/ousi: cf. 36. 2 n. and Hecat. fr. 290 vines cf. 37. 4 n. Diodorus (i. 34) says the Egyptian beer was called zu=qos; it was considered to be as necessary for the dead in the other world as for the living in this. Aristotle (Athen. x. 418) noted that a man drunk with wine lay on his face, while beer laid him on his back. ta\\ de\\ a)/lla: translate 'which they consider to belong to the class of birds or fishes'. For salting birds cf. Wilkinson, fig. 99, i. 290. nekro/n. Plutarch (Mor. 357; I. et O. c. 17) and Lucian also mention this custom. It has not been confirmed by the monuments, but Maspero (A. E. G., 1876, p. 186) points out that the little wooden figures, so common in museums, of a mummy on a bier 'exactly correspond to the description of H.' The lesson which it was intended to teach (e)s tou=ton o(re/wn ktl.) is found in native poems; cf. the two versions (time of the New Empire) quoted by Erman, E. 386-7, e.g. 'cast behind thee all cares and mind thee of the joy, Till there cometh that day when we journey to the land that loveth Silence'. For the same lesson elsewhere cf. 1 Cor. xv. 32, and Petron. Satyricon 34, where a 'larva argentea' is shown to the guests. grafh=|: i.e. by painting, e)/rgw| by the shape of the wooden figure. Stein says the figure was that of Osiris, the lord of the dead; for every righteous man became 'an Osiris' on death; cf. 86. 2 n. for H.'s silent reference to Osiris in his account of embalming: Plutarch, however (u.s.), says 'it was not a memorial of the passion of Osiris', but usually; translate 'quite, altogether'. patri/oisi: the conservatism of the Egyptians was as marked as that of the Chinese; for an even stronger assertion of this cf. 91. 1. Here H. proceeds (cc. 79, 80) to add two apparent exceptions. e)pa/cia here and in vii. 96. 2 must = 'worthy of mention'; but in vii. 96 parame/mnhmai immediately precedes. The Greek Linus corresponds to Adonis, the Syrian Tammuz (cf. Ezek. viii. 14 Mysian Hylas; cf. H.'s remark 'his name varies from tribe to tribe'. All these were conceived of as beautiful young men, beloved of the goddess, and perishing untimely. The story is said to be a sun-myth (Sayce, s.v. 'Tammuz' in Hastings's Dictionary). Frazer, however (G. B. ii. 115 seq.), with more probability, says it represents 'the death and resurrection of vegetation'. For the connexion of the reaper's song with the myth cf. ib. pp. 253-8. If Frazer is right in explaining the story of Osiris (ii. 137 seq.) in the same way, it is only natural that Linus-Maneros should have been introduced into the Osiris myth (cf. Plut. I. et O. c. 17). For Adonis worship, which was especially a female cult, cf. Theocr. Id. 15 and Milton, P. L. i. 446 seq., of Tammuz Whose annual wound in Lebanon alluredThe Syrian damsels to lament his fateIn amorous ditties all a summer's day. Linus, who was worshipped in Argos, was said to be the son of Urania, killed by Apollo from jealousy of his voice (Paus. ix. 29. 6-7); but there are other versions of the story. The name is as old as Homer (Il. xviii. 570), who makes it a reaper's song. In Hesiod (fr. 132) it has a be the Eastern cry, 'woe unto us,' raised at the festival; the Greeks first borrowed this as ai)/linon (cf. Soph. Aj. 627), and then, by a mistaken etymology, interpreted it as 'alas for Linus'. w(uto/s. Asthe context shows, H. means the 'same person', not name. H. (c. 99) calls the 'first' king Menes, and perhaps he is meant here; others suppose a reference to some earlier god-king. The name 'Maneros' does not occur on the monuments; perhaps it means 'come thou back' (maa-ne-hra, a formula which occurs in the Book of the Dead). mou/nhn. There were certainly other 'hymns' in Egypt; probably H. refers to the 'tune'; the monotony and uniformity of all oriental popular songs is well known; from their sad character they reminded the Greeks of the Linus song. For the Lacedaemonian custom cf. the story in Cic. de Sen. 18, of the Lacedaemonian envoys setting the Athenians an example of respect for old age. Respect to parents is a frequent subject in the papyri; it is so common, however, among all nations (cf., e. g., Levit. xix. 32 'Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head'), that it seems strange H. should deem it worthy of notice. In early Egypt complete prostration had been usual, but under the New Kingdom only the lower classes practised this, while the higher made a deep reverence, as here described. H. had seen this in the streets, though he did not mix with the upper classes (cf. 36. 2, 3 nn.). kiqw=nas: for dress cf. 36. 3 n.; for the *kalasi/ries 164. 2 n. The Orphic rites spread widely in sixth century Greece; their popular character, as opposed to the exclusiveness of the old worships, led to them being patronized by the tyrants; Onomacritus, 'the Orphic apostle' (Busolt, ii. 364), the Pisistratidae (vii. 6. 3 n.); so too Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sicyon, encouraged the worship of Dionysus (v. 67. 5), with which the Orphic rites were closely connected. (Cf. Gomperz, Gk. Thinkers, ii, p. 137.) For the Orphic doctrines and their relation to those of Pythagoras cf. Gomperz (ib. caps. 2 and 5; Busolt, ii. 362 seq.): a shorter account is given by Bury (pp. 311-18). The teaching was at once cosmological and religious; the latter is the more important. The Orphic sect taught the doctrine of metempsychosis (cf. 123. 2 n.); they laid stress on the worship of Chthonian deities, and on initiation into mysteries, and on other methods of purifying the soul from sin. Gruppe, however, in Roscher, Lexicon, iii. 1105, s. v. 'Orpheus', denies that an 'Orphic sect' can be proved; there were, he thinks, numerous associations, the members of which looked on Orpheus as their founder, and followed similar practices, but these were disconnected and were no 'more united as a sect than modern vegetarians or and e)ou=si, they were 'called Orphic' but 'were really Egyptian, brought by Pythagoras from Egypt' (cf. 53. 3 for disbelief in a primitive Orpheus). There is no contradiction between this passage and the statement as to ta\\ peri\\ to\\n *dio/nuson in 49. 2; H. means that Melampus brought Dionysiac mysteries from Egypt, Pythagoras copied rules of life. mei/s. Each month in Egypt was consecrated to a god, from whom sometimes its name was derived. The days of the month too were assigned, the first to Thoth, the second to Horus, the third to Osiris, &c. H. is right that horoscopes were much cast in Egypt. The day on which a man was born determined his fate, e. g. a man born on the 9th Phaophi would live to be old, on the 23rd would be killed by a crocodile; no child born on the 23rd of Thoth could live, &c. Cf. Papyrus Sallier IV, now in the B. M., for a calendar of this kind. oi( e)n poih/si, 'those who have employed themselves in poetry'; the contemptuous reference is to books like Hesiod's Works and Days, and also to the oracular poems attributed to Orpheus and Musaeus. te/rata, 'prodigies,' i. e. for forecasting the future, as the context shows; although no collection of prodigies has been found in Egypt, there is abundant evidence that they were observed and explained; but such collections were more frequent in Chaldaea. H. is right in saying that in Egypt there was no official prophet like the Pythia at Delphi; the gods themselves communicated their will through dreams (cf. Gen. xli for those of Pharaoh), but cf. 54. 1 n. For Heracles cf. 42. 3 n.; for Athena 62. 1 n.; for Ares 63. 1 n.; for Apollo c. 156; for Artemis 59. 1 n.; for Zeus 42. 1 n.; for Leto c. 156. The Egyptians are already famous as physicians in the Odyssey; cf. iv. 227-32 Helen has drugs from Egypt where plei=sta fe/rei zei/dwros a)/roura | fa/rmaka. Maspero (p. 89) doubts whether H. does not exaggerate; there were general practitioners as well as 'specialists'; for an Egyptian oculist cf. iii. 1. 1. For Darius' Egyptian physicians and their drastic methods of treatment cf. iii. 129, 132. Egyptian medical science goes back to the Old Kingdom, e. g. in the B. M. Papyrus 10059 some prescriptions date from the time of Cheops; it was a curious mixture of sense and magic, e. g. it was believed that a decoction of a black calf's hair kept off grey hair. A specimen of it is the famous papyrus edited (1875) by Ebers. It greatly affected European medicine; Erman (E. 364) quotes a curious instance of an old Egyptian prescription for determining the sex of an unborn babe, which survived down to late in the eighteenth century. kat' w)=n e)pla/sato: cf. 39. 2 n. The practice of mourners smearing themselves with mud is still found in Egypt; that of uncovering the upper part of the body, and 'girding themselves up' below the breasts, is seen on the monuments. Cf. for it Homer, Il. 72) gives a similar account of the mourning for the Egyptian king. There are resemblances also in the burial ceremonies of the Spartan kings, which H. (vi. 58. 2) compares to those of barbarians in Asia. ou(/tw. The funeral procession is represented on the monuments much as H. describes it. Embalming was connected with the Egyptian idea as to the soul, the Ka; the continued existence of this depended on the survival of the body; if the body perished, the soul perished. No doubt the means of preventing this were originally suggested by the dry air and sand of the desert, which parched the flesh and prevented decay; then artificial means were invented; Anubis was said to be their author (cf. Maspero, i. 112, 178 seq.). H.'s account of embalming is on the whole very accurate; it should be compared with that of Diodorus (i. 91), which is somewhat fuller, and with Budge, The Mummy, 1893, pp. 173-84. It may be noted: (1) Mummied bodies are found exactly as described, some preserved by bitumen and some by saltpetre. (2) They have a hole bored from the 'nostrils' (mucwth/rwn) to the brain and an opening in the 'flank' (lapa/rhn). (3) Obsidian or flint knives (li/qw|) are frequently found in graves with mummies; for the use of these primitive implements in religious ceremonies cf. Josh. v. 2 (R. V.), 'knives of flint' for circumcision. (4) The linen wrappings and the 'wooden figure (cu/linon tu/pon) in form of a man' are familiar in all museums. (5) H. is often too absolute in his statements; he makes invariable what was only usual. (6) It is curious that he makes no reference to the Book of the Dead, the formulae of which were at first inscribed on the coffin, while later the whole collection was bound up inside the bandages. For the various forms of this and other funeral literature cf. B. M. G. pp. 58 seq. kate/atai, 'set themselves to this very thing'; cf. kati/zw in 126. 1, but there the local sense is more clearly present. te/xnhn. Diodorus (u. s.) says the calling was hereditary, and H. implies the same; this was usual, but not an absolute rule. ou)k o(/sion: the reference is to Osiris; the mummy was made like him, in order that the dead man might obtain access to the realm where he ruled (cf. Maspero, i. 182 seq.); the dead man in fact became an Osiris. H. declines to mention the name 'in regard to such a matter', cf. c. 3 nn. for parallels to, and explanation of, this religious reserve; Wiedemann thinks H. omits the name 'because he had no clear conception of Egyptian mysteries'. This is incredible; H. was familiar with hundreds of names in Egypt, and yet we are to suppose that he did not recognize that of Osiris, the most familiar of all. deute/rhn: Diodorus says that the best embalming cost a talent of silver, the second twenty minae, the third very little; there were more varieties than he and H. describe. ou(/tw: i. e. 'by a crooked iron', corresponds to the e)gxe/ontes fa/rmaka. 'The skulls of mummies are found to contain absolutely nothing' (Budge), which confirms H. e)cei=lon: translate 'they clean out the belly completely'; cf. 40. 1 n. e)cei=lon is taken up by e)kkaqh/rantes. The viscera extracted were placed in four jars, popularly but wrongly called 'Canopic jars', each covered with the head of a genius, a son of Osiris (cf. Erman, E. p. 306, for picture). nhdu/n = koili/hn above. For the spices cf. iii. 107 seq. It is curious that H. does not mention the 'asphalt' employed; perhaps he thought it merely a foundation for the more expensive materials. 'Frankincense' was not used, because it was sacred to the gods. o)pi/sw: they 'sew up the back passage', i. e. to prevent the entrance of air. li/trw| is either 'saltpetre' (Stein) or 'soda' (Wiedemann); the object of this pickling was to remove the moisture and fat, and to harden the skin. The Papyrus Rhind agrees with H. as to the length of time for embalming, 'seventy' days; it seems, however, to have varied; cf. Gen. 1. 3 for 'forty' days (in the case of Jacob). sindo/nos is the general word, bussi/nh gives the special material, 'linen'; H. is right, as the bandages were universally made of linen (Budge, p. 190). ko/mmi. 'Gum' exuding from the acacia is mentioned, 96. 1. No doubt the finer sorts for embalming were imported. The mummy was kept 'upright' for a time, till the death sacrifices, &c., ceased; then it was transferred to a lower 'vault', where it was laid down. The vaults of the rich were often hewn out of the hills, because of the dryness of the air there. It seems probable, however, that in the Fay\u00fbm the mummies were kept above ground, owing to the dampness of the soil. skeua/zousi. The Greek is much compressed; H. means skeua/zousi (nekrou\\s) tou\\s ta\\ H. has, however, misunderstood the object of its use; this was to check corruption till the li/tron had done its work. The discharge (e)ciei=si) was that of humours generated before the 'pickling' was complete. H. was misled by the fact that in a mummy only skin and bones are left, and inferred the cause wrongly. e(/drhn is used instead of o)pi/sw o(do/s (cf. 86. 5), for variety. e)shqh/santes: i. e. by means of klusth=res. e)pilabo/ntes, 'checking.' surmai/h|: oil made of radishes; cf. 77. 2 for its purpose. Here, too, the work of preservation was done by the li/tron. ou) parauti/ka: this delay in embalming women is confirmed by archaeology; cf. report of E. E. F., 1908, p. 19. tou/tous. Constructio ad sensum with o(/s d' a)\\n ktl. For the sacredness of the dead drowned or destroyed by a crocodile cf. Griffith, Z. A. S. xlvi. 132, and Nat. Home Reading Mag., June, 1904; the evidence is later than H., but the belief may well be earlier than the surviving evidence. Ael. N. H. x. 21 says mothers even rejoiced when their children were killed by crocodiles. The visit to Chemmis, which H. here implies, is denied by Sayce ad loc., and (more in detail) J. of P. xiv. 267-8. He argues (1) Chemmis is not near Neapolis (Kenneh), but eighty-four miles away; (2) the description of the temple and its statues is quite un-Egyptian. He is answered by D. D. Heath (ib. xv. 227 seq.), who points out that H. is describing a non-Egyptian building; it may be noted that he uses pro/pula, not the usual propu/laia. Heath conjectures that H., writing from memory, has put 'Chemmis' for 'Coptos', which latter town is close to Neapolis. It is probable, however, that Neapolis is wrongly identified (v. i.). *xe/mmis: hod. Akhm\u00eem (not the island of Chemmis in the Delta; cf. c. 156), used to be called by the Greeks 'Panopolis', as being the shrine of 'Chem' or 'Min' (the hieroglyph is variously read), who was usually identified with Pan, as being ithyphallic and 'on account of his Priapic nature'. *ne/hs po/lios: this is usually thought to be Neapolis (hod. Kenneh), which lies opposite Tentyris on the right bank of the Nile; but it may well have been quite a different town, on the site of the later Ptolemais; this last was only about six miles from Chemmis. i(ro/n here = te/menos, the whole sacred enclosure (so Heath, who well compares, i. 181. 2, that of Belus at Babylon); it is called below tw=| peribeblhme/nw|. *perse/os. The identification of Perseus with 'Chem' it is impossible to explain for certain; perhaps it was connected with Chem's title 'Peh'resu', which sounded like 'Perseus'. At all events it is as baseless as the story that (vii. 61) the Persians derived their name from this hero. The whole story is Greek in (1) the idea of an anthropomorphic god, who leaves his temple and can be traced by his footsteps; (2) the organized games; (3) the character of the prizes. There must have been a Greek settlement at Chemmis; but Maspero's (iii. 649 n.) suggestion that it may really have belonged to the time of the 'Philhellene' Amasis (cf. Hecat. fr. 286, F. H. G. i. 20 for possible similar Greek settlements on islands in the Nile, called 'Ephesus, Chios, Samos', &c.) must be rejected, as quite inconsistent with ii. 178. For games in the worship of Chem at Edfu cf. Lepsius, D. iv. 42 b (vol. ix); but they are quite un-Greek in character. The footstep of Heracles stamped in rock by the Tyras (iv. 82) was also 'two cubits'; cf. that of Buddha in Ceylon, which measures about 5 1/2 by 2 1/2 feet, or that of St. Peter in the Domine Quo Vadis Chapel at Rome. e)/xonta, 'extending over every kind of contest,' i. e. the 'meeting' embraced running, jumping, wrestling, javelin, and discus. *danao/n. According to Greek story Lynceus was the nephew and son-in-law of Danaus (cf. Hor. Odes, iii. 11. 37 f.), and four generations removed from Perseus. The connexion of the Perseidae with Egypt is a genuine Argive legend, not like the late invention (Diod. i. 29) which makes the ghgenh/s Erechtheus come from Egypt to Athens. Perrot and Chipiez suggest (L'Art Myc\u00e9n\u00e9en, pp. 77-8) that perhaps soldiers of fortune belonging to northern tribes, who, after having served in Egypt, were expelled and settled in Argolis, were considered to be Egyptians; but this is the merest conjecture. Genuine Egyptians certainly never settled in Greece. No historical conclusions can be drawn from the legends, though for other reasons early intercourse between Egypt and the Aegean, especially Crete, is certain. Cf. J. H. S. xii. 199 seq. (1891) and E. Meyer i. 172, 228, 291, 510, 520-3. H. (vi. 53. 2) lays stress on the Egyptian ancestry of the Spartan kings, as descendants of Perseus; this all Greeks affirmed. He is supposed by Panoffsky (p. 55) to be here (ii. 91) borrowing from Pherecydes, who told the story of Perseus (cf. fr. 26, F. H. G. i. 75); but there is not the least evidence for this. e)kmemaqhko/ta, 'because he was thoroughly familiar with.' The participle is put out of place for emphasis. The customs of the inhabitants of the marshes as opposed to those ofh( speirome/nh *ai)/g. (77. 1). [For this part of Egypt cf. Hogarth, A. A. L. pp. 99 seq.] H. is right in treating of the marshmen separately; the marshes had a distinct history, and were a refuge for those expelled from Egypt, e. g. the blind Anysis (137. 2), Psammetichus (151. 3), and Amyrtaeus (140. 2). So in Roman times they made the 'Bucolic' rebellion (A. D. 172). They were less civilized and cleanly than the other Egyptians, and H. exaggerates their resemblance (toi=si\\ au)toi=si no/moisi xre/wntai). mih=|: monogamy seems to have been the rule in Egypt, though Diodorus (i. 80) says rightly that all but the priests had as many wives as they pleased. Kings and wealthy men, however, had a numerous harem; e. g. Rameses II had nearly 200 children. sunoike/ei. We should have expected the participle (cf. i. 85. 1). This lotus (Nymphaea Lotus) is to be distinguished from the Cyrenaean lotus (cf. 96. 1 and iv. 177 n.), which is that of Homer. It is of two kinds, the white and the blue; it was actually cultivated for food. Theophrastus (H. P. iv. 8) describes the method of obtaining 'the fruit'; he, like H., compares the head (kwdu/a) in size to 'the poppy' (mh/kwni) and the root to a 'quince' (mh=lon). The lotus was used in the ritual of the dead, and so became a symbol of immortality. e)pieike/ws, 'moderately'; a a(/pac leg. in H. We should expect e)ou=sa, but it and the predicate stroggu/lon are attracted loosely into the gender of me/gaqos. Stein, however, makes stroggu/lon a substantive = 'a round body'. a)/lla: bean' (cf. trwkta/, 'kernels'). It does not grow in Egypt, nor is it found on the older monuments; probably it was introduced by the Persians. It is represented in the famous Nile statue of the Vatican. H. is wrong in saying that the ka/luc grows on a separate stalk, right as to its rose colour. e)pe/teion. H. lays stress on the 'annual' growth of the papyrus, because only the young shoots could be eaten; the old were too wooden. It was once so common that it is the hieroglyphic symbol of Lower Egypt; its growth was restricted later, to enhance its price (Strabo, 800), and it has now disappeared. H. only refers indirectly to its manifold uses; for these cf. 37. 3, shoes; 96. 3, sails; 7. 36, cables; v. 58. 3 n., writing material. diafane/i+, 'red-hot'; cf. iv. 73. 2, 75. 1, of the stones used in the Scythian vapour-bath; but there puri/ and e)k puro/s are added. i)xqu/es. That fishes migrate to the sea for breeding is of course a fact; to it has been added this strange myth, which Aristotle (de G. A. iii. 5, 755 b 6) rightly calls eu)h/qh kai\\ teqrulhme/non and shows eggs are compared to 'millet seeds' (ke/gxrwn); translate 'by a few grains at a time'. It would have been simpler if H. had written this particle and the use of the optative after a present show that H. is speaking 'ironically', and that he does not accept the purpose of the fish as a real fact. gi/netai and pi/mplatai are co-ordinated, as frequently in H., for the sake of vividness, though the former is really subordinate. H. is wrong both in his facts and in his inference. The parts furthest from the Nile fill first not last, and the fishes are brought by the water, which comes through channels and not by irrigation. From these inaccuracies Sourdille (E. p. 7) concludes that H. was in Egypt only after the Nile rise had begun. oi( peri\\ ta\\ e(/lea is the same as oi( sillikupri/wn: the castor-oil plant, Ricinus communis; H.'s name is due to the fact that it grows in Cyprus. a)/gria, 'of a wild kind,' opposed to the Egyptian variety described. kw/nwpas. H. rightly lays stress on the number of flies in Egypt, but it is not likely that he is right as to their being unable to fly high; men slept on the roof for coolness. Stein accepts H.'s statement that the fishing-net was used as a mosquito curtain, Wiedemann denies it, and F. Ll. Griffith says 'it is beyond belief' (A. and A. p. 192). It may be true; but more probably H. confuses the fishing-net and a coarse mosquito curtain. H., like a true Greek (may we add, like a Greek merchant?), is always interested in boats and navigation. Cf. the similar description of the skin-boats on the Euphrates (i. 194). The peculiarity of these ba/rides is that they were built up of short pieces of wood, and hence had not the ordinary framework (nomeu=si, 'ribs,' \u00a7 2) of a Greek ship. Stein, however, is clearly wrong in saying they were 'rafts', with low sides; they had a keel (tro/pis, \u00a7 3) and a high stern and prow, as is shown in the tomb picture of their building (Lepsius, D. ii. 126, vol. iv), at Beni Hasan. For models in B. M., Third Egyptian Room, cf. B. M. G. p. 102. H. mentions no iron, perhaps intentionally; in this case the 'barides' would resemble the ironless boats of Ormuz on the Persian Gulf, which M. Polo (i. c. 19) describes. a)ka/nqh: the 2; he says rule, however, the timber from it was much shorter, and hence the 'baris' was built in the way described below; Egypt was destitute of proper ship's timber. Nile boats are still built of acacia planks. Uni, fetching alabaster (Breasted, i. 323) from Hatnub, builds a boat of acacia, nearly a hundred feet long and fifty wide. Noah's ark was built of acacia wood (Gen. vi. 14 'gopher wood'). For the 'Cyrenaean lotus' cf. iv. 177 n. plinqhdo/n. The short pieces (cu/la) were arranged 'like bricks', i. e. in alternate layers, so that their joins might not come together. go/mfous. The 'long bolts at frequent intervals' (puknou/s) were, so to speak, the string, on which the short pieces were 'strung'; they were driven in vertically to the layers. periei/rw is a a(/pac leg. zuga/. The 'cross-pieces' served at once to hold the framework together, and as a sort of deck. a(rmoni/as; the 'joins' were 'caulked' with the fibre of the papyrus, which would then be fixed with tar. e)n w)=n e)pa/ktwsan: for the aorist and the tmesis cf. 39. 2 n. phda/lion. As a rule a Greek ship had two steering oars at the stern, 'fastened to the sides just below the gunwale'; but in the 'barides', the 'steering oar passed through the after end of the keel' (Torr, pp. 74-5). i(stw=|: it was not usual to find acacia wood of sufficient length for a mast; but cf. Theophrastus, u. s. ou) du/natai: H. is quite right in saying that the vessels were not sailed up stream, and in implying that they were usually 'towed'. qu/rh. The framework of the 'crate' was of 'tamarisk wood', over which a 'wattle of reeds' was worked. The object of this was not (as H. says) to catch the current, but to keep the vessel straight as it drifts with the stream; steering is of course impossible with a drifting boat, as boat and stream are moving at the same pace. Chesney (ii. 640) describes an almost exactly similar method of guiding with the skin-boats of the Euphrates (cf. i. 194 nn.). li/qos tetrhme/nos: the original form of anchor (cf. Hom. Od. xiii. 77); here by lessening the speed of the boat it made it possible to steer with the phda/lion (\u00a7 3). a)pi/ei: i. e. the boatman. e)pife/resqai: i. e. the 'crate' is 'on the surface', opposed to the li/qos, which is e)n bussw=|. ba=rin: an Egyptian word, used by Aeschylus (Pers. 554et al.) of Persian vessels. tala/ntwn: about 1/40 of a ton; cf. i. 194. 3, those on the Euphrates are of '5,000 talents burden'. The comparison to 'islands' is made by other ancient writers (e. g. Strabo 788) and is quite accurate; so too is the account of the cruise in flood-time, if it is understood to mean that the canals were at that time full; by these only could a man is implied. H. first states this for the part above Naucratis, and then, in the words e)s *nau/kratin a)po\\ qala/sshs, makes the same statement for the below Naucratis, repeating dia\\ pedi/ou. For Cercasoros and Canopus cf. 15. 1 nn. The sites of Anthylla and Archandropolis are uncertain. From this chapter Sayce infers (J. of P. xiv, p. 260 seq.) that H. was in Egypt at the time of the inundation, which is right; he even fixes the date of his arrival at Naucratis (about July 20)! But he also infers that H. was in Egypt only during the inundation, which is a good instance of an argument with an undistributed middle. For similar assignments to the royal family cf. Xen. Anab. i. 4. 9 (Syrian villages for the Queen Mother's zw/nh, and ib. ii. 4. 27). They were also given to private individuals, e. g. Themistocles received Lampsacus, Magnesia, and Myus, to provide his table (Thuc. i. 138. 5; Plut. Them. 29). Cicero (Verr. iii. 33, 76) quotes 'Persian gifts' as familiar. *)arxa/ndrou. Pausanias (ii. 6) makes him son (not grandson) of Achaeus (cf. vii. 94, where Danaus and Xuthus, father of Achaeus, are synchronized); hence some have proposed to translate tou= *fqi/ou 'the Phthiotian'; but the order of the words makes this impossible. It is idle to force consistency on independent legends. With c. 99 begins the third part of Book II, i. e. the history of Egypt. This divides (at c. 147) into two parts: (a) the story of Egypt as told by the Egyptians themselves, and (b) that which is based in part on the evidence of other nations, i. e. the story after the opening of Egypt to the Greeks by Psammetichus. H. recognizes the difference in the evidence for these two parts, though he does not appreciate how great it was (cf. 147 n. and App. X. 10; Introd. \u00a7 27). *mi=na. The Egyptian form MNA left the vowel to be supplied; hence *mh/nhs (Manetho), *mh=nas (Diodorus), *minai=os (Josephus). Menes was long considered an invention, and used to be quoted as an instance of H.'s credulity; but the tomb of the king (Aha) identified with him was discovered in 1897 at Nagada near Abydos (Petrie, i. 17), and more fully explored in 1904 (King and Hall, pp. 57, 64). He seems to have united the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, and so to begin a new epoch (circ. 3400 B. C.). chapter. a)pogefurw=sai, &c., lit.

The Nile makes a great bend to the east, fourteen miles to the south of Memphis; but 'it is impossible to say if there is any truth in H.'s tradition' (Maspero, p. 53). Breasted (p. 37; cf. also E. E. F., Report for 1905, p. 39) accepts it, and Murray (pp. 188-9) shows that its distance from Memphis here given is very accurate. e)/ti kai\\ nu=n. H.'s words imply that the Persians were in undisputed possession of Memphis (cf. App. IX. 1). There is no trace of lakes near Memphis; H. may be misled by the Nile flood filling the canal, the Bahr Y\u00fbss\u00fbf; its dry bed can still be seen to the north and west of Memphis. But Diodorus (i. 96) speaks of the Acherusian lake near Memphis, the circuit of which city he makes seventeen miles, and Murray (u. s.) accepts this as a fact. Cf. 97. 2 for the time of H's visit. to\\ i(ro/n. This temple\u2014that of Ptah\u2014is most important as the probable source of H.'s information as to Egyptian history (cf. App. X. 10). bu/blou. These lists, which recorded a king's stature, character, and deeds, as well as the length of his reign, are mentioned by Diodorus (i. 44); on them Manetho based his history. (For them cf. App. X. 1.) Where H. obtained his '330' it is impossible to say; on it he bases (142 n.) his calculation as to the length of Egyptian history; but, apart from other difficulties, H. is wrong in making the kings all succeed each other; no doubt several of the dynasties were contemporary. *ai)qi/opes: C. 137 mentions an Aethiopian invasion, that of Sabacos; but these '18' seem to be different. For Nitocris at Babylon cf. i. 185 n.; for this Egyptian queen cf. F. Petrie, i. 105, and Hall, J. H. S. xxiv. 208-13. Nitocris is placed by Manetho at the end of the sixth dynasty; eu)morfota/th tw=n kat' au)th/n, canqh\\ th\\n xroia/n, and attributes to her the third pyramid (cf. 134 nn.). But her very existence seems doubtful; the Neterkara of the sixth-dynasty monuments was prob ably a king, not a queen. (For the origin of the confusion see Hall, u. s.) There was also on the Turin papyrus a Queen Neitakerti, who may be the original of H.'s Nitocris; perhaps she belongs to the period of confusion under the fifteenth to the seventeenth dynasties; but there was no trace of the story told by H. The name may be connected with Nitocris, who was made priestess of Thebes by her father, Psammetichus I (cf. for her, Cairo Museum, No. 673, p. 208, E. T.); H. had heard much of this Saite house. kainou=n, 'ostensibly she handselled it.' spodou=: she would be choked by the ashes. Ctesias (48, 51, 52, pp. 76-7) mentions this as a Persian punishment used by Darius Ochus; cf. also Val. Max. ix. 2. 6, and Ovid, Ibis, 317. tw=n a)/llwn basile/wn: dependent the accusative tou\\s a)/llous b. is attracted into the case of the dependent clause (cf. toi=si in i. 24. 5), and translate 'the other kings were in no way distinguished' (lit. 'were at no point of distinction'). Probably H. means by 'Moeris' the great king Amenemh\u00eat III (cf. App. X. 5) of the twelfth dynasty (for his portrait cf. B. M. G. p. 218; for the construction of Lake Moeris see c. 149 nn.). Diodorus also calls him Moeris, Manetho, *la/maris or *la/baris. He received a nickname from this lake (probably to distinguish him from other kings, called 'Amenemh\u00eat'); but his real name, in its Greek form Marrh=s, had a somewhat similar sound (Z. A. S. (1906) 43, p. 86). His date is probably 1849-1801 B. C.; hence it is clear that H. is wrong in placing him only ten generations before Psammetichus (cf. App. XIV. 3). propulaia. The entrance to the Egyptian temple was through a pylon in the outer wall, i. e. a gate flanked by towers, shaped like truncated pyramids; the court inside was full of pillared halls; the pylones and the pillared court inside, leading to the wall of the actual temple, together form the propu/laia. H. mentions four of these in this temple at Memphis, to north (here), to west (c. 121, Rhamsinitus), to east (c. 136, Asychis), to south (c. 153, Psammetichus). The story of Sesostris. Sesostris has been variously identified. Of the Greeks, Diodorus (i. 53) puts him seven geneai/ (i. e. 'dynasties') after Moeris, thus identifying him with Rameses II; this has been very largely accepted. Cf. Tac. Ann. ii. 60. But it is better to suppose that his name at any rate is that of the great conqueror of the twelfth dynasty, Senosret III (Usertesen), who was the first invader of Syria. Manetho (F. H. G. ii. 560) puts 'Sesostris' at this date. With his name, however, were associated (Meyer, i. 281) some of the later glories of Thothmes III and Rameses II (cf. cc. 106, 107 nn.), and the whole was developed into a mythical figure, which bears even less resemblance to the truth than the mythical Alexander to the real Alexander. Maspero, however (p. 267 n.), explains the name = 'Sestour\u00ee, a nickname for Rameses II (Greek writers used this in place of the Pharaohs' real name); cf. the loose use of 'Caligula' for the emperor Caius. Strabo (769) is more definite and says Sesostris penetrated south to the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb (*deirh/), and crossing them, returned through Arabia. All this is fiction; the only Egyptian campaigns to the south were against the Nubians (c. 110 n.); the North S\u00fbd\u00e2n was occupied; Senosret II also conquered some of the Semitic tribes in North Arabia (F. Petrie, i. 172-3). Egypt did not fully establish its rule on the Red Sea till the time of the Ptolemies. H. cautiously gives his authority for the conquests of Sesostris to the north and east; Strabo (769) takes him over 'all Asia'; Diodorus (i. 55) makes him cross the Ganges and overrun all India to the ocean; no doubt this detail was invented to make him outrival Alexander, just as he is made to conquer the Scythians (c. 103) in order to surpass Darius (c. 110). Really, however, no Egyptian conqueror ever penetrated beyond North Syria except Amenhotep II, who actually crossed the Euphrates. It was an Egyptian custom to set up columns in record of conquest, but the addition of sexual emblems (given more fully, Diod. i. 55 et al.) is a Greek invention. H. seems to be referring to actual monuments in Thrace, but unluckily he does not say what they were; the conclusion he bases on them is obviously false, but this does not prove (cf. 106 nn.) that he had not seen them. It has been inferred from this passage that H. was twice in Colchis and twice in Egypt, which is unlikely, if not impossible. He may well have seen Egyptians in Asia Minor, before his travels in the Black Sea, which almost certainly preceded his visit to Egypt (cf. Introd. pp. 14, 19). mela/gxroes. H. has already (57. 2) said the Egyptians were 'black'; this was the usual Greek idea (so Aesch. Sup. 719); it is an exaggeration of the 'brown' colour; the Colchians were 'black' in the same sense; so Pind. Pyth. iv. 212 (376) calls them kelainw=pes. The hair of the Colchians was short and curly, as contrasted with the lank locks (eu)qu/trixes, Arist. de G. A. v. 3, 782 B) of the Scyths. H.'s ideas of Egyptian appearance have been somewhat confused by the numerous negro slaves he saw in the streets of Memphis. As the Egyptians themselves shaved wholly or in part (36. 1 n.), the 'woolly hair' is the more inexplicable. Various attempts have been made to find a basis for H.'s 'discovery' (noh/sas pro/teron) of the identity of the Colchians with the Egyptians (cf. Wiedemann, p. 408); the least improbable is the suggestion that the Persian king had deported Egyptians to Colchis. But it is most likely a mistake altogether. For circumcision in Egypt cf. 36. 3 n. H.'s method\u2014to infer identity of race from similarity of custom\u2014is modern, though its sufficiency is doubted; here certainly his conclusion is wrong. His information as to Phoenician usage in Greece (\u00a7 4) is curious. *su/rioi oi( e)n th=| *palaisti/nh|. For these cf. iii. 5. 1 n. H. does not distinguish the Jews from the other inhabitants of Palestine; the Philistines were not circumcised (cf. 1 Sam. xvii. 26 et pass.), nor all the Phoenicians (Ezek. xxxii. 30). Josephus (Antiq. viii. 10. 3), however, is wrong in saying the Jews alone in Palestine practised the rite. For *su/rioi in general cf. i. 6 n. H. here extends them beyond the Halys to the river Parthenius, which lay in the very west of Paphlagonia, though in i. 72 he kept them east of the Halys. For the Macrones who live on the south-east of the Black Sea cf. iii. 94. H. seeks to confirm his point by reference to the similarity of Egyptian and Colchian manufactures. His familiarity with Greek trade-names is interesting (cf. Introd. p. 17). Some have proposed to read *sardihniko/n, supposing the Colchian linen was imported via Sardis; but Pollux (v. 26) quotes H. for *sardoniko\\n li/non. It is more probable that some Colchian word had been wrongly changed to the familiar *sardoniko/n; of course the linen had nothing to do with Sardinia. Strabo (498) says the Colchian linen was famous (teqru/lhtai); the passage implies a criticism of H.'s Colchian theories. au)to\\s w(/rwn. At the mouth of the Nahr el Kelb near Beyrut there are three monuments cut in the face of the limestone rock, on one of which the name of Rameses II can be read; they commemorate the victorious campaigns of his early years (e. g. 'year 4'). Beside them, in contempt, Esarhaddon has cut the account of his conquest of Egypt (circ. 670 B. C.; cf. Breasted, pp. 424, 556). They are figured in Lepsius, D. iii. 197. There is no trace of the ai)doi=a on them now, nor is it likely there ever was. In the pass of Karabel, south of the road from Smyrna to Sardis, two monuments have been found, of which one (figured in Rawlinson) corresponds to H.'s account. For it cf. Garstang, pp. 171 seq. The road from 'the Ephesian territory to Phocaea' is clearly not the road along the coast, but one more inland, round Mount Sipylus. pe/mpths: translate '4 1/2 cubits high' (not 1/2 talents'. The spiqamh/ is 12 'fingers', i. e. half a cubit; others make it only 10 fingers, i. e. 7 1/2 inches. The figure is really about 7 feet high. H. has misplaced the weapons; the bow is in the right hand, the spear in the left; w(sau/tws, the rest of the dress 'corresponded', being both Egyptian and Ethiopian; the bow was especially the Ethiopian weapon, cf. vii. 69. The dress, however, is not really Egyptian; the high cap and the shoes with points turned up are 'Hittite'. The inscription (now illegible) is above the figure in the corner, not on the breast. It is not likely that H. or his guide could trans late it, nor is the rendering here ('with my shoulders'; others conj. o(/ploisi) at all in epigraphic style. Memnon is not the Egyptian king whose musical statue was famous (cf. Paus. i. 42. 3; Frazer, ii. 530; Tac. Ann. ii. 61), but the king of Ethiopia, son of Aurora, who came to help Priam (Od. (Paus. x. 31. 7, though Frazer, ad loc., argues this was not H.'s 'Royal Road'). The original Memnon is identified by Robertson Smith with Adonis, a god 'first dead and then alive' (cf. E. H. R., 1887, p. 307), and became the centre of many strange myths; for the birds at his grave cf. Ael. H. A. v. 1 and Frazer, Paus. v. 387. The stories of 'Memnon' belong to a later stage of mythology, when men placed the Homeric 'Aethiopians' in Africa; but the name is Egyptian. If, as is possible, the myth of Memnon is a reflection of a great Anatolian 'Hittite' empire, the view rejected by H. was correct. The statue at Karabel certainly resembles those at Boghaz Keui and elsewhere; it probably is that of the Hittite war-god. The great Egyptologist, Lepsius, however, like H., thought the figure Egyptian. Ramsay (H. G. of A. M., p. 60) thinks H.'s topographical details are impossible, and considers that he never went 'more than a few miles from the coast' (of Asia Minor), and so had never seen the monument he here describes; H. had been told there were three roads to Sardis, viz. from Phocaea, from 'the Ephesian territory', and from Smyrna, and that two of them were marked by monuments, i. e. the Karabel relief and the 'Niobe'; these three roads H. confuses and makes into two. This criticism of Ramsay's is not usually accepted; but even if H. has confused the roads, it does not follow that he had never traversed them. If Ramsay be right that H. never left the coast, the historian would be convicted of a serious suggestio falsi; though he does not say distinctly that he had seen the Ionian monuments, he certainly implies that he had done so and that he had traversed the roads. The whole chapter is most interesting as showing: (1) The care of H. to use archaeological evidence; (2) his mixture of accuracy and inaccuracy in the use of it; the latter is easily explicable, considering the difficulties under which his observations were conducted; the figures are high up above the road; (3) his ignorance of history before the seventh century. He has no idea of the limitations of Egyptian power, or of the existence of great Anatolian powers in the past. The story of Sesostris' brother seems to be quite unhistorical, though it occurs in different forms in Diodorus and in Manetho; the latter (Jos. in Ap. i. 15) identifies Sesostris and his brother with Aegyptus and Danaus. Perhaps the harem conspiracy against Rameses III when old (Breasted, pp. 498 seq.) may be the origin of the story; but there is no resemblance in details, and it is more probably an echo of the myth of the strife of Set and Osiris (62. 2 n.). oi(: ethical dative. For a pronoun's transposition cf. oi( ga/r me ktl., i. 115. 2. This use of captives to carry out public works is historical (cf. Exod. i. 11); some of the works are mentioned in c. 110. For a picture of a colossus thus dragged cf. Rawlinson, ad loc. For a list of the buildings of Rameses II cf. Petrie, iii. 72 seq. The canal system, to which H. refers in i. 193 and iv. 47, for comparison with Babylonia and Scythia, is not the creation of any individual king; irrigation was essential to the very life of Egypt. What H. (\u00a7 4) gives as cause is really effect; the cities were built on canals, not the canals made for the cities. ou)k e(ko/ntes, 'without intending it.' Diodorus (i. 57) makes this the main motive. H. is not happy in his remark to\\ ... i(ppasi/mhn, chariots and horses do not appear on the Egyptian monuments before the eighteenth dynasty. o(/kws te (if te be read) only occurs here; cf. oi(=os te, e)pei/te (this last only in H.). H. is right that the 'spring' water in Egypt is 'somewhat brackish' (platute/roisi). It is true that all the land of Egypt, except that of priests and soldiers (so H. himself, c. 168), was held of the king and paid to him one-fifth of the produce; the Jewish story attributed this arrangement to Joseph (Gen. xlvii); there is no reason for assigning it to any one king (Meyer, i. 224, puts it as early as the fourth and fifth dynasties). Probably, however, there was a basis of truth for the tradition which connected land taxation with the conquering Sesostris; as kings developed a spirited foreign policy, the burden of taxation on their subjects was organized and increased. H. is wrong as to lots being equal. Translate 'might pay in future in proportion to the rent fixed' (cf. e)pita/canta a)poforh/n above); i. e. rent was diminished in proportion to the amount of land lost, but the rate of assessment was unchanged. The po/los was a concave, hemispherical 'dial', so called from being shaped like the vault of the sky; on this a shadow was cast by the gnw/mwn (a 'pointer'), which marked the time of day by its direction, and the chief seasons of the year (the solstice, equinox, &c.) by its length at midday. The period from sunrise to sunset was divided into 'twelve parts', which of course varied in length with the season of the year. Diogenes Laertius (ii. 1) says Anaximander invented the gnw/mwn: but this need only mean that he introduced it from Egypt. It is most natural to suppose (cf. D. of A. s. v. Polus) that H. is speaking of one 'compound instrument'. Others, however (e. g. D. of A. s. v. Horologium), think that he means to distinguish the gnw/mwn and the po/los. Both certainly were used independently of each other; the gnw/mwn was the earlier, in the form of a pillar, which measured time by the length of its shadow. That geometry was an Egyptian invention was the general belief of the Greeks. For the whole subject cf. the 'Eudemian summary' (based by Proclus, circ. 450 A. D., on the history of Eudemus, circ. 330 B. C.). This is translated in Gow's Hist. of Gk. Math., pp. 134 seq. (a short paraphrase in Smith, D. B. s. v. Euclides). According to this (for other evidence cf. Gow, p. 131) geometry was invented because the Nile floods destroyed all ordinary boundaries (cf. Strabo 787 for the same statement). Thales introduced geometry into Greece; but it was the Greeks who made it a science; in Egypt it was confined almost entirely to the practical requirements of the surveyor (Gow, p. 126). Cf. 102. 2 n. and B. M. G. pp. 213 seq. for the campaigns of the twelfth dynasty in the south; the rock temples of Abusimbel witness the activity of Rameses II in Nubia; but many other Egyptian kings beside Senosret III and Rameses II gained victories over the Nubians. a)ndria/ntas. At M\u00eetrah\u00eeneh (near Memphis) are two colossal statues of Rameses II lying overthrown; the larger of these is about fortytwo feet, which corresponds to H.'s 'thirty cubits' (Baedeker, p. 141); for cast of its head cf. B. M. G. p. 245. For other statues in the temple at Memphis cf. 121. 1, 141. 6 n., 176. 1. The story of Darius' concession is an invention of Egyptian vanity; but it is characteristic of his conciliatory policy (cf. vii. 7. 1 n.). *ferw=s is simply the title 'Pharaoh' turned into a proper name (cf. its use in Genesis, pass.). The story of H. is merely 'a satire on the truth of women', and the town of 'Red Earth' (\u00a7 3) is a purely imaginary place; Diodorus (i. 59), who tells the same tale, calls it *(iera\\ bw=los. Maspero (C. P. pp. xlii. seq.) points out that the tales in the papyri are equally unfavourable to feminine chastity; but, like the similar tales of mediaeval Europe, he thinks them due mainly to male unfairness. o)ktwkai/deka: cf. 13. 1 n. for height of Nile rise. The disgusting remedy is a genuine piece of Egyptian medicine; Maspero (C., p. 315) suggests that it was employed for the natural ammonia in it, and thinks it was sometimes really effective. e(kato/n. The obelisk now at Heliopolis is only sixty-six feet high, but a great part of it is buried by the rise of the soil level; it was erected by Senosret I, of the twelfth dynasty (Baedeker, p. 117). The largest obelisk in the world, that before the Lateran, is over a hundred feet high, and no doubt still larger ones have perished; but H.'s figure, 150 feet, is suspiciously big. Homer and Egyptian history. The words, 'a man of Memphis,' imply that Proteus was of a different family from the previous kings. Homer (Od. iv. 126 makes Polybus king in Egyptian Thebes at the time of the Trojan War, and Manetho (F. H. G. ii. 581) identifies him with the last ruler of the nineteenth dynasty, whom he calls *qou/wris. Diodorus (i. 62) follows H. Perhaps H. has confused an Egyptian title, Prout\u00ee, with the familiar 'Proteus'. It is suggested that, as Proteus is a sea-god in Homer (Od. iv. 385), H. may have identified him with the fish-god (Dagon) of the *turi/wn strato/pedon (112. 2). At any rate, H. does not commit the absurdity of Diodorus (u. s.), who explains the famous transformations of Proteus as a myth due to the Egyptian custom of the king wearing lion skins and other articles on his head, to inspire terror and reverence. In 154. 1 strato/peda is used for the Greek settlements on the Pelusiac Nile; the alien quarter in a town was of the nature of a camp. Aphrodite is called cei/nh to distinguish the Phoenician Astarte from the Aphrodite of Egypt (Hathor, cf. 41. 5 n.). H. is probably wrong in identifying her with Helen (cf. vi. 61 n.). This temple of 'Proteus' was found by Petrie (1907-8). As H. says, it lies south of the Ptah te/menos, and the only tablets of Hathor found were dug up here; this agrees with his statement as to the 'foreign' Aphrodite (E. E. F., 1908, p. 15). The temple seems also contemporary with the date that H. gives for the Trojan War, i. e. the thirteenth century B. C. (145. 4 n.). H. is supposed to have borrowed this story of Helen in Egypt from Hecataeus (cf. Diels, Hermes, 22). In the fragments attributed to that writer, Menelaus is certainly brought to Egypt (fr. 287, F. H. G. i. 20), and Helen is in some way connected with Canopus (fr. 288). But H.'s account differs in important details; e. g. he does not mention Pharos (contrast fr. 287), and his story of the slaves has nothing to do with fr. 318. We know there was a great variety of legends about Helen (cf. especially Stesichorus, fr. 32, who said that only a phantom of Helen was taken to Troy). Hence the connexion of H.'s story with Hecataeus is at least unproven. For the Canopic Nile cf. 15. 1 n. There was a 'curing station' (tarixei=ai) also near the Pelusiac Nile (ib.). H. seems to have visited this temple, but no Egyptian parallel has been found for such a general right of asylum as H. speaks of. The temple, however, is a reality (cf. Strabo, 788, who makes it one of the western boundaries of Egypt). The name *qw=nis comes originally from Od. iv. 228 (cf. 116. 4), where the wife of *qw=n makes presents to Helen; his name was combined with the early town, Thonis, on the Canopic Nile (Strabo, 800), and he was made an Egyptian official. parepoi/hse: he 'introduced an inconsistent digression'; in this sense the is a a(/pac lego/menon. a)nepo/dise, 'he never corrected himself'; lit. 'cause to step back'; this passage indicates clearly H.'s implicit belief in Homer. These lines are in Iliad vi (289 seq.); only Bk. V is now called the 'Prowess of Diomede'; hence H. clearly did not know the present division into 24 books. The passages from Odyssey iv (227 seq., 351-2) are probably interpolations; there is no reference to them below. And the presence later of Menelaus and Helen in Egypt is (to say the least) a very indirect proof of the wanderings of Paris. H. rejects the Homeric authorship of the Cypria, as later he doubts it of the Epigoni (4. 32 ad fin.). The Cypria told the origin and the first part of the Trojan War; the main figure in its action was Aphrodite, hence its name. It is characteristic of the later rationalization of the Epic story that as much stress is laid on the treasures as on Helen herself; for a like contrast between Homeric romance and the common sense of H. contrast Iliad iii. 156 seq. and c. 120. 1. In the story of the misconduct of Menelaus there may be an echo of early struggles between Egypt and the races inhabiting Greece and the Aegean (cf. the story of Odysseus as to the raid against Egypt, told to Eumaeus, Od. xiv. 257 seq.). But it is more probably an Egyptian invention, a retort to the Greek charge of human sacrifices (c. 45) brought against Egypt. So it is quoted by 'Plutarch' (De Mal. H. 12), in connexion with the story of Busiris, as a mark of the 'philo-barbarism' of H. 'Plutarch' also says Menelaus was much honoured in Egypt. The sacrifice of Iphigenia is a familiar parallel. *)/entoma poiei=n is used in vii. 191 for sacrifices to allay a storm, but nothing is there said of their being human. There was a 'harbour of Menelaus' in Libya (iv. 169. 1). ou)k e)/sti o(/te ou) = numquam non, 'on of ei) ti toi=si e)popoioi=si tw| i(/kanos (sc. Homer) tekmhriw=sai and the sayings of Greeks, e. g. Solon, fr. 29 polla\\ yeu/dontai a)oidoi/. The whole chapter is an instance of Greek rationalizing criticism. Diodorus (i. 62) makes Remphis succeed Proteus; he does not tell the tale of the thieves, but only that the king was famous for avarice. The kings of the twentieth dynasty almost all bear the name 'Rameses' (III to XI), from which H.'s 'Rhampsinitus' is formed by the termination 'nitus'; this seems to correspond to the name of Neith, the goddess of Sais (Maspero, Ann. des \u00c9. G., 1877, p. 133). With this imaginary king, whose name blends Theban and Saite elements in an impossible way, H. combines Rameses III, who certainly was a temple-builder at Memphis; he was also renowned for his wealth (cf. B. M. G. p. 250); his treasuries can still be seen at Med\u00eenet Habu (Baedeker, p. 322). So far history confirms the framework into which H. has introduced a popular tale; for the prevalence of robberies of royal tombs under the twentieth dynasty cf. B. M. G. p. 250. The tale itself is one of the most familiar pieces of universal folklore; we may compare it to that of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, or to that of Trophonius and Agamedes (Paus. ix. 37. 3, who gives an almost exact epitome of the first two parts, a and b, of the story of H.). A list of twentyeight variants of the story, from all parts of the world, is given by Frazer (Paus. v. 177). The king's daughter's question, the device of the thief, and the marriage that ends the story, all show that it belongs to fairyland, not to the world of reality. For a further discussion of it cf. Maspero, C. P. pp. xl. seq., 180 seq., who maintains that it is, if not Egyptian in origin, at least thoroughly 'egyptianized'. qe/ros, xeimw=na. The identification of these statues is more than suspicious; the Egyptians divided the year into three seasons, not two, those of the inundation, of growth, and of the harvest. And only one instance is known in Egypt of symbolic statues of this kind (Sourdille, R. p. 215). For treasure houses of this kind in Egypt cf. the twelve crypts at Dendera (Baedeker, p. 244), the entrances to which were once closed by movable stones; plural, the 'ragged ends of a skin', where the feet and tail have been; hence, in the singular, the mouth of a bottle, formed by one of these ends being left open while the others were sewed up. This end was 'tightly bound round' (a)pamme/nous. L. and S., however, seem to take this = 'hung on the ass'). The ass-driver, pulling at the skins, as if to pull them straight (e)pispa/s anta), looses the ends. kataskeua/zein, 'repack' the ass's burden, the balance of which had been spoiled. For this mark of insult cf. 2 Sam. x. 4 (Hanun's treatment of David's embassy). Wiedemann shows that some of the Egyptian soldiers, especially the police, wore beards, and that H. therefore is not to be charged with introducing a foreign detail into the story. deina\\ poie/ein, 'showed himself very angry' (cf. iii. 14. 6); more common in the middle voice = 'to think it shameful' (cf. 133. 2). The vanity of the Egyptians was proverbial, and this touch brings it out clearly. sugkubeu/ein. For the Egyptian fondness for dice cf. B. M. G. p. 87; they were buried in the tombs (ib. p. 178). For the bringing up of a token from the lower world cf. Maspero, Cont. Pop. pp. 118-19; Satni in the tomb wins the magic book after playing a game; the tale is preserved in a Ptolemaic papyrus. Plutarch (de I. et O. c. 12) says that Hermes won from Selene (Isis), when playing at draughts, a seventy-second part of each day, and that out of these the five 'intercalary days' (cf. 4. 1 nn.) were made up. au)thmero/n. For the offering of the 'new garment' to the goddess cf. 1 Sam. vi. 7. lu/kwn. Perhaps H. means 'jackals' (cf. 67. 1 n.). Erman (R. p. 177; cf. p. 15) sees a reference here to the two Wepwawet gods, the jackal-headed 'guides' of the dead. u(po/keitai ktl. For this principle, so often forgotten by H.'s critics, cf. vii. 152. 3. Demeter and Dionysus are Isis (c. 41 n.) and Osiris (cc. 42 nn., 62. 2 n.). H., having introduced the subject of the world below, brings in another doctrine as to life after death, which he thought the Greeks had borrowed from Egypt. Whether metempsychosis was really a doctrine taught in Egypt is uncertain. Wiedemann rightly says that it is inconsistent with the preservation of the body by embalming, and that the number 3,000 is quite insufficient for Egyptian ideas; he therefore supposes that H. confused the doctrine of immortality, which in a certain form (cf. Maspero, M. et A. E. I. 48 seq.) the Egyptians undoubtedly held, with that of metempsychosis, and wrongly attributed the latter to Egypt. H. would be the more likely to do this, as the Egyptians believed the souls of the blessed could at will take any form they pleased (Sourdille, R. p. 365). Gomperz (Gk. Thinkers, i. 126-7) considers the doctrine of metempsychosis rather Indian than Egyptian, and seems to believe that the Greeks had been brought into relation with the Indians by their common subjection to Persia. He also quotes Egyptian doctrines as to the changes of the soul's abode, which H. may have misunderstood. The number 3,000 recurs in Plat. Phaedrus, 29, p. 249 A, but only for the 'truly philosophic soul'. Empedocles, who is certainly referred to in u(/steron, gives '30,000 years' (w(=rai fr. 115, ed. Diels) as the period for the purification of sinful souls. By oi( pro/teron H. means probably the Orphic teachers (cf. 81. 2 nn.), and certainly Pythagoras (cf. iv. 95-6). Whether Pythagoras was in this doubtful (cf. Gomperz, i. 542). H. avoids censuring Pythagoras by name, perhaps because he was a Samian (but cf. i. 51. 4 for similar reticence). The doctrine of metempsychosis was widely diffused in the sixth century, and it is possible that it may have been taught at Croton before Pythagoras came there, by the mysterious Orpheus of Croton (cf. Gruppe, Rosch. Lex. s. v. Orpheus, p. 1131, who accepts H.'s statement that it was an Egyptian doctrine). The pyramid-builders. Their names, Khufu, Kh\u00e2fra, and Menkaura are correctly given, but their chronological position (2840-2680 B. C.) is entirely wrong; they belong to Manetho's fourth dynasty, while H. puts them after a king of the twentieth dynasty, and only three generations before Psammetichus (666 B. C.). For explanations of H.'s mistake cf. App. X. 10, or (better) Petrie's ingenious theory (J. H. S. 28. 275) that H. composed Bk. II in twelve divisions of about equal length, and that cc. 100-23 (two sections) have been wrongly placed before cc. 124-36, which should really precede them; the order should be roll 7 (207 lines), cc. 124-36; roll 8 (222 lines), cc. 100-15; roll 9 (224 lines), cc. 116-23: the coincidence in number of lines is at any rate very curious. For casts of the statues of the pyramid-builders in the B. M. see G. pp. 196, 199, 200; that of Chephr\u00ean is 'one of the leading examples of ancient art' (Petrie, i. 54). kataklhi/santa. This impiety is contrary to the monuments, on which 'Cheops' figures as a temple-builder. 'What H. relates is only the copy of a popular story' (Maspero, p. 77). The sufferings of the Egyptian people under the pyramid-builders had coloured tradition as to them. H. as a Greek would be the more ready to accept the accusation of impiety, because the mere building of such gigantic masses offended the Greek sense of moderation. Similarly, in the story in the Papyrus Westcar (now in Berlin), Chufu impiously appeals to the magicians to defeat the will of the god Ra. Cf. cc. 126, 128 nn. e(/lkein. For the transport of great masses by human labour cf. Breasted, i. 694 n., the colossal statue of Thuthotep (under the twelfth dynasty) drawn by 172 men in four double rows (picture, ib. 159). kata\\ de/ka. This must mean that a gang of 100,000 worked for three months, and were then relieved by another gang. For relays of workers cf. 1 Kings v. 13-15, and for forced labour ib. ix. 21 (both of Solomon). Meyer (i. 233; so too Petrie, Pyramids, p. 210), however, thinks the three months are those of the rising of the Nile; the blocks were cut all the year round, but transported during the period when field-work was impossible. Petrie says: 'Such a scale of work would suffice for the complete building in twenty years as stated by H.' H.'s informant may have meant this, but if so H. certainly misunderstood him. de/ka e)/tea. The me/n corresponds to the the road and the 'chambers' (\u00a7 4 oi)khma/twn) took ten years, the pyramid itself twenty. th=s o(dou=. Two roads can still be traced, one to the first, the other to the third pyramid; their object was to serve as an inclined plane, up which the stones could be dragged from the Nile level to the edge of the plateau, which is a hundred feet above the plain (cf. e)pi\\ tou= lo/foi). purami/s: an Egyptian word = 'a building with a sloping side'; B. M. G. p. 170. diw/ruxa. H. had never been inside the pyramid; a connexion with the Nile is impossible, as the underground chamber in the centre of the pyramid, though a hundred feet at least below its ground level, is yet thirty-six feet above the river level. H. gives further particulars as to the 'channel of masonry' in c. 127. 2. Sourdille (H. E. p. 12) thinks that H. has, by a confusion of memory, attributed to the pyramids of Gizeh the subterranean water which is really found under other pyramids, e. g. at Hawara, near the Labyrinth. H.'s measurements of the pyramids can best be estimated from the following table (fractions are neglected): PetrieHerodotusDiodorus i.63PlinyGreat Pyramid.Length of side (average)756800700883Height (original) (present 451)481\u2014more than 600\u2014Height (along sloping side[It seems to be generally agreed that this is the height given by H.; it is calculated as 19/20 of the base.]720 (circ.)800\u2014\u2014Second Pyramid.Length of side706600\u2014Height (present 469)472'40 feet in size inferior to the other' (127.3), i.e. along sloping side\u2014\u2014Height (along sloping side)330 (circ.)280 (but see 134.1 n.)\u2014\u2014 The modern figures are taken from Murray's Egypt, pp. 170 seq. It is there pointed out that 'nine modern writers have equally (with the ancients) varied in their calculations'. Petrie sums up (u. s. 159), 'the accuracy with which H. states what he saw and relates what he heard, the criticism he often applies to his materials ... all this should prevent our ever discrediting his words, unless compelled to do so.' H.'s account of the building of the pyramid is creditably free from marvels: contrast the stories in Diod. i. 63 of the 'mounds' by which the stones were taken to the top, &c. kro/ssai: cf. iv. 152. 4 and vii. 188. 1 with nn. for the derivative pro/krossoi.

'The rest of the stones,' i. e. to fill up the triangular gaps between each 'step'. The great pyramid when finished presented a smooth surface, though in the present day the stripping off of most of its stone covering (here described, \u00a7\u00a7 2-5) has made it once more 'like steps'. mhxanh=|si. Petrie writes (u. s. p. 212): 'for the ordinary blocks of a few tons each it would be very feasible to employ the method of resting them on two piles of wooden slabs, and rocking them up alternately to one side and the other by a spar under the block, thus heightening the piles alternately, and so raising the stone.' He goes on to show how this method could be applied to the largest blocks in the pyramid, of fifty tons and upwards. But the explanation of Choisy (L'Art de b\u00e2tir chez les \u00c9gypt., 1904, p. 80 seq., with pictures and diagrams) is better, viz. that the stones were raised with 'ascenseurs oscillants'; these resemble in shape the wooden framework, used to support temporarily arches in England; ancient models of them are in the B. M., the Louvre, and at Cairo (cf. App. IX. 4). tosau=tai. H.'s good sense has made him put first what is obviously the right alternative; the constant shifting of one 'contrivance' from row to row is impossible. H.'s description is right, whether we suppose that the whole pyramid was planned and carried out at once (cf. Petrie, u. s. p. 163, for a discussion of this question), or that a pyramid grew with the length of its builder's reign, being continually extended. This 'accretion' theory of Lepsius is now in favour again. In either case the 'step formation' must come first, and then the 'filling up of the angles' (e)cepoih/qh). surmai/h. For the use of the 'radish' as a purge cf. c. 77. 2; the 'onions and garlick' were for relishes not 'food' (siti/a, \u00a7 7). eu)= memnh=sqai. It can hardly be inferred from this, as some have done, that H. trusted his memory in his observations, and made no notes. He only wishes to emphasize the accuracy of a surprising statement. Diodorus (i. 64) and Pliny here repeat H. Maspero (Ann. des \u00c9. G., 1875, p. 18) explains this strange inscription as a prayer to Osiris, scribbled by an Egyptian tourist, that he might obtain the blessings of food, &c., and mistranslated by the guide. It would be a kind of parody of the inscriptions usual on tombs, praying that Osiris would give (such blessings) to the departed. It is simpler (with Murray, u. s., p. 163) to suppose that the royal inscription was mistranslated; the onion plant was the hieroglyph for 'nesut' ('king'), and the papyrus and the lotus were used in spelling his titles as 'Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt'. But if this be the explanation, H.'s memory as to the exact place failed him; there were no official inscriptions on a pyramid, except close to the entry of the actual tomb-chamber; this one must have been in a temple near. Some, however, have thought that H.'s guide was as unable to read hieroglyphics as H. himself, and that he concealed his ignorance by a complete invention, which he meant also to be a joke. To a)/llon supply some word like e)po/neon (out of oi)kodo/meon) by zeugma. o(ko/te is 73. 1. o(ko/son dh/ ti: the words that follow seem to show that this phrase implies uncertainty on the part of H.; cf. i. 157. 2. He is confirmed by the monuments (Breasted, A. R. i. \u00a7 180) in saying that one of the three small pyramids near the Sphinx, to the south-east of the Great Pyramid, is that of the daughter of Cheops; Vyse, 2. 183, says its workmanship is similar to that of the Great Pyramid. The rest of the story is a fable, to cast discredit on the pyramid-builders (cf. i. 93 and ii. 121 for similar stories as to the 'Tomb of Alyattes' and as to Rhampsinitus). As Maspero points out (Ann. des \u00c9. G., 1875, p. 21) the story-tellers of Memphis took the great names of history and 'made them odious and ridiculous'. He compares the romance of Setn\u00e9 (or Satni) for a similar motive, i. e. the sacrifice of a woman's honour to obtain an end otherwise unattainable. In this tale too Rameses II (under one of his names) and Menephtah both figure, but the latter has become a distant ancestor instead of a son (ib., 1878, p. 171, where the story is given almost in full, pp. 142-69). H. himself may have heard it in Egypt. The Chephr\u00ean pyramid is a little larger than H. says. It is hard to believe that a king who reigned fifty years could be succeeded by a brother who reigned fifty-six years. The monuments give the name of Tetfr\u00e2 between, who seems to have been quite unimportant. Maspero (p. 76) suggests that Chephr\u00ean was his brother, and so really the son of Cheops. Manetho (F. H. G. ii. 548) are absurd; Meyer (i. 234) gives Cheops twenty-three years, on the authority of the Turin and other papyri. The words tau=ta ga\\r ... *xe/opa (end of 2) seem to be a later addition: they interrupt the antithesis (Av. 1130). Diodorus (i. 64) tells us there was an a)na/basis up one side of this pyramid. oi)kh/mata. H. does not mean there were no 'chambers' at all in this pyramid, but that there were none like those surrounded with water, which he was told (wrongly) were under the pyramid of Cheops (c. 124). As a matter of fact there were two chambers under that of Chephr\u00ean. li/qou *ai)qiopikou=: the red granite of Syene; H. is right, for 'the first layer' (do/mon) of stones was faced with this material, as was also the second. th=s e(te/rhs: genitive after the idea of comparison in u(poba/s; tw)uto\\ me/gaqos, 'to attain the same size,' is added to explain u(poba/s. e)xome/nhn is local here. poime/nos. This story may contain the one reference in H. to the conquest of Egypt by the 'Hyksos' or Shepherd kings. For the extent of their rule and for their chronology cf. App. X, \u00a7 6, and B. M. G. pp. 224 seq. The Egyptians called them 'Shasu' ('robbers'); hence 'Hyksos', 'the rulers of the robbers.' Their rule was a time of oppression and degradation, and so may have been blended in popular memory with the times of the pyramid-builders. H.'s informants suppressed all mention of this conquest. Possibly 'Philitis' is connected with 'Philistines', a tribe which may have formed part of these invaders. a)noi=cai. Contemporary evidence confirms H.'s tradition of the piety of Menkaura. Of course, however, the temples were not 'opened', for they had never been closed (cf. 124. 1 n.). It need hardly be added that his justice, in which 'by gifts from his own purse he satisfied the wrath of him who found fault after the sentence', is a popular myth. A coffin, of which the lid bears a cow's head, has been found of the time of Chephr\u00ean (L. D. ii. 14, vol. iii); there is no evidence, however, of its occupant's rank, nor even that it was a human being's. Lepsius says that queens were identified with Isis, whose symbol the cow is. For a picture of Isis with horns, and the sun between them (132. 1), cf. Maspero, i. 132. au(/th h( bou=s. The pyramid-builders had nothing to do with Sais, and H. has wrongly introduced them into a rite which clearly was connected with the story of Osiris (cf. Plut. I. et O. 39, quoted on c. 62). For a mummy, no doubt that of Osiris, in a sacred cow, cf. R. de T. iv. 26; but it is only about 18 inches long (not life-size, as in c. 132). It used to be thought that Psammetichus II had the second name of 'Menkaura', and that H. was referring to some monument of his; but this theory is now given up. gumnai/. The Egyptians never represented women in statues quite naked; but the linen fabrics were so fine and clinging as to be transparent. For such a dress cf. figure in Erman, E. p. 214, and Maspero, C. P. p. 124; Maspero adds in a note that the linen fabrics in the museum at Cairo quite confirm the tradition (cf. the 'Coae vestes' of the Romans). The chapter is interesting as a specimen of H.'s attempts at criticism; Egyptian wood statues, being made in pieces, like dolls, were particularly liable to lose their forearms. The kai/ simply emphasizes h(mei=s; there is no reference to other travellers (e. g. Hecataeus, suggested by Wiedemann). See 62. 1 n. for the connexion of Neith, the goddess of Sais, and Isis. The ceremony is part of the festival of Osiris (cf. to\\n ou)k o)nomazo/menon qeo/n, and the bringing out of the cow symbolized Isis' search for Osiris. For tu/ptwntai cf. 39. 4 n.; for religious silence cf. 3. 2, 86. 2 n. suntaxu/nein: intrans. here as in iii. 72. 1. Mycerinus was to have reigned forty-four years ('150' with Cheops and Chephr\u00ean); H. does not tell us in what year the oracle came, so that the actual length of his reign is uncertain. lu/xna polla/. The 'many lights' are borrowed from the Osiris festival (v. s.); for the luxnokai+/h cf. c. 62 nn. Matthew Arnold's poem on Mycerinus is well known. As Wiedemann says, the endeavour to cheat the oracle is a Greek trick; but the mention of the marshes as 'places of pleasure' (e)nhbhth/ria) is quite in accordance with Egyptian usage. The sarcophagus and the wooden coffin of Mycerinus, with portions of his mummy, were found in this pyramid by Vyse in 1837; the former was lost on its way to England, but the coffin and the mummy are in the first Egyptian room at the B. M. (No. 6647, Case B; B. M. G. p. 201); it has been held that the coffin is a late restoration of the Saite period, Z. A. S. xxx, p. 98, but this is doubtful. The genitive podw=n depends on katade/ousan in the usual way; ple/qrwn is probably to be taken with kw=lon, 'on each side of three plethra'; but the construction is curious, as is also the deliberate anacoluthon of e)ou/shs. tetragw/nou: cf. i. 178. 2. Petrie (u. s. p. 160) explains doubtfully the discrepancy by referring H.'s figure (280) to 'the base of the limestone part', which really was 275 feet. H. is right in saying that half the pyramid was cased with 'red granite' (li/qou *ai)qiopikou=). *(podw/pios. H. shows his usual sense in rejecting this preposterous attribution, which is made by Diodorus (i. 64, as an alternative) and by Strabo (808); he shows it is contrary both to probability and to chronology. Two explanations are given of the origin of the story: (1) It has been held that additions were made to the pyramid by a later queen (the Nitocris of Manetho, cf. 100 nn.), and that the Greek fiction as to Rhodopis was a version of the story of her work. But 'the Manethonian story of Nitocris and the pyramid is an impossibility' (Hall, J. H. S. xxiv. 208). (2) It is more probable that we have here an adapted popular story. The modern Arab tale that the third pyramid was haunted by a beautiful naked woman, who drove men mad, may easily be very old; perhaps it is connected with the 'red painted' face of the Sphinx and its inscrutable smile. This may be the explanation of the Greek fiction which we have here, and, in a modified form, of Manetho's version (cf. 100 nn.). Rhodopis was a real person; her name seems to have been Doricha (though Athenaeus, 596, denies this). Greek fancy played about her, as it did later about Phryne and Thais, e. g. Strabo (u. s. attributes the 'shoe' part in the Cinderella story to her. die/dece: used impersonally in an intransitive sense (cf. iii. 82. 3). The sentence beginning e)pei/te ga/r is an anacoluthon. The story of Aesop is told by Plutarch (de Ser. Num. Vind. c. 12. 557 A). Croesus had sent him to distribute four minae to each of the Delphians, but Aesop sent back the money to Sardis; enraged at this, the Delphians unjustly condemned him to death for sacrilege, and executed him. Afterwards they suffered from 'strange diseases', until they made atonement by paying compensation to Iadmon. The story was obviously unknown to H. (cf. i. 54), and also that of Aesop's residence at the court of Croesus (Plut. Sol. 28ad init.). Myers (Hell. p. 454) quotes this passage and vi. 139 as proofs of the higher morality of Delphi, which cares for the lives of women and slaves. Tradition credits Aesop with written works; but the passage as to his ge/loia (Aristoph. Wasps, 566) seems only to imply oral tradition; at all events the fables that bear his name have been held, since Bentley, to be forgeries. It has been denied that Aesop is a real person, but the evidence of H., who may well have met at Samos some of the family of Iadmon, is conclusive against this scepticism. e)s *ai)/gupton. No doubt Rhodopis was brought to Naucratis, with which both Samians and Mytilenaeans had a special connexion (178. 2, 3); *(podw=pin: translate 'for enough for her to attain to', &c.; cf. iv. 81. 1 for construction; but it is very harsh. tou=to to/ = toiou=ton oi(=on; cf. iv. 166. 1. a)naqei=nai, 'to attribute to her' (cf. 134. 2); the word is used = 'dedicate' three lines below. H. is obviously writing as an eyewitness, and this part of the story may be Delphic tradition. The altar of the Chians was found by the French in 1893, on the spot indicated by H.; to judge from Pausanias it was in this part of the precinct that dedications were most numerous; cf. ix. 81. 1 and Paus. x. 14. 7 with Frazer, v. 309-10 and 631. boupo/rous: large enough to roast a whole ox. For the magnificent feasting of Delphi cf. i. 51. 2. Athenaeus (u. s.) says the 'spits' were peribo/htoi, and quotes Cratinus as to them. Charaxus was a wine merchant; for a new fragment of Sappho 'chiding' him, but apparently not for this amour, cf. Class. Rev. xxiii. 103-4. Menkaura was succeeded by two nameless kings and then by Shepseskaf (Meyer, i. 235). Diodorus (i. 65) makes Bocchoris succeed Mycerinus, and (i. 94) says that he 'settled the laws of contract'; he also (ib.) mentions Sasyches as the second of the lawgivers of Egypt (v. i.). This last may be the king meant by 'Asychis', but if so, he is out of place, for he seems to belong to the second dynasty. H.'s confusion is unexplained. a)podeiknu/nta (sc.tina): 'that a man (ou(/tw). th/nde ... zhmi/hn. If H.'s account be right, this 'penalty' is the real point of the law; the 'whole grave' was transferred to the creditor, though he could not disturb mummies already placed in it. But Erman (R. 190) thinks that the reference may be really to the perpetual charge of graves vested in the class of xoaxu/tai, who were paid a stipend; these charges were hereditary sources of profit, and so could be alienated or pledged by their holders. e)k pli/nqwn. What pyramid H. means is disputed. Stein, on account of the reference to the li/mnh (\u00a7 4), thinks one of the brick pyramids by Lake Moeris is meant; there are also two brick pyramids at Dahsh\u00fbr, some twenty miles south of Gizeh. pli/nqous ei)/rusan. This passage is parodied by Aristophanes (Av. 1144-6). Caps. 137-41 contain a distorted version of Egyptian history during the time of the great Assyrian conquests. At this period an Ethiopian dynasty ruled in Thebes, though native Egyptian princes, under the protection of Assyria, held their ground, as H. says (cf. c. 152 n.), in the Delta. H. turns the twenty-fifth dynasty (725-667 B. C.) of Manetho into a single king, Sabacos (137. 1); there were at least four kings in it, of whom Shabaka was one; the last, Tanut-Amen, was expelled by Esarhaddon. Popular tradition remembered only Sabacos; he seems to correspond to 'So, king of Egypt' (2 Kings xvii. 4), who incited Hoshea of Samaria to resist Assyria, and so brought about his destruction. It is needless to say that H., here as elsewhere, completely fails to appreciate the greatness of Assyria (see c. 141 n.). *)/anusin. Manetho (fr. 64-5) says Bocchoris of Sais preceded the Ethiopian conquest. Two suggestions are made to reconcile H. with Manetho. (1) That Bocchoris is called 'Anysis' by H., from the name of his town, while Manetho calls him a 'Saite' from his nome (so the eleventh dynasty is called 'Theban', though really from Hermonthis). (2) It is simpler to suppose that Anysis was not a king, but only a local chief, like Necho the father of Psammetichus (152. 1). The site of Anysis is very variously identified, e. g. by Sayce with Hanes (? Heracleopolis Magna), near the Fay\u00fbm (J. of P. xiv. 283). It may be the same as Anytis (c. 166), which seems to be in the Delta. For the marshes cf. cc. 92 seq. nn. The account in H. is based on two facts of Eastern life: (1) Imprisonment as a punishment was unknown; the criminal, however, became a state slave for shorter or longer period. (2) Town sites are usually higher than the country round; the mud houses rapidly fall into ruins, their remains are not removed, but levelled as a foundation for their successors. Greek imagination, however, always attributed the result of a long process to an individual act. For a curious result of this rise of height cf. 138. 2; the temple is below the city level. A similar feature is often seen in modern churches, but on a less scale. For Bubastis cf. 59 n. The 'city' at Bubastis is contrasted with the temple. The temple was excavated by M. Naville for the E. E. F. (1887-9); an account of the results is given in the eighth memoir (1891; also in part in the tenth, 1892). The destruction had been so complete that no light is thrown on H.'s account of the buildings; but M. Naville confirms his accuracy as to (1) the island-like nature of the site; (2) the depressed position of the temple; 'the account is clearly that of an eyewitness' (p. 3); (3) the direction and the length of the road (\u00a7 4) which is traceable (p. 60). H. is partially mistaken in assigning the smaller temple to Thoth; his name occurs in the inscriptions, but the building was probably a treasury (ib.). Hermes, i. e. Thoth. He was connected with the worship of Osiris (cf. Diod. i. 15-16), and was identified by the Greeks with Hermes as being yuxopompo/s. For pictures of him in the judgementhall of Osiris cf. B. M. G. p. 140. 'end not to the main verb e)kxwrh/sein. Wiedemann says that this story of voluntary retirement by the last Ethiopian king is found on the monuments; but really the Ethiopians retired before the Assyrians. This chapter is important for H.'s chronology. (1) For its bearing on the date of Amyrtaeus (cf. iii. 15 n.). (2) H.'s figure, 'more than 700' (\u00a7 2), hopelessly contradicts the data given elsewhere. Anysis is divided from Psammetichus I only by the reign of Sethos; as Psammetichus succeeded 663 B. C., Anysis would have died about 700. But Amyrtaeus belongs to the middle of the fifth century (v. s.), and so the interval should be 250, not '700' years. It has been proposed to alter the text; but it is clear that H. has combined variant traditions without being aware of it. (Cf. App. XIV. 3.) If this island had a real existence at all, it is obvious that it must be as hard to identify it as it was to find it; we can only say that it is conceived of as in the Delta region. Neither Manetho nor the monuments know the name of Sethos; and the repulse of Sennacherib from Egypt probably belongs to the reign of Tirhaka (701-667 B. C.). Sethos may have been a local priest, ruling in Lower Egypt under the Ethiopian, and turned by popular tradition into a king; but probably 'Sethon' is indeclinable and = 'Setne', the popular form of the priests' title; for this turning of a title into a proper name cf. 111. 1 n. (Griffith, High Priests of Memphis, p. 9). The name 'Satni' is common as that of the hero of various popular Egyptian tales. *ai)gupti/wn: a constructio ad sensum, as if H. had written a)logi/hi e)/xein. For the warrior caste cf. c. 164. The mention of Arabians here (and inf.) may well be right; Sennacherib, like Cambyses later (iii. 5), probably had Arabian guides across the desert. Josephus, however (v. i.), blames H. for the statement. The parallel to the account in 2 Kings xix is very marked, but the childishness of H.'s tradition is in strong contrast to the dignified simplicity of the Jewish one. The sudden break-off in Sennacherib's inscription (the Taylor cylinder now in B. M.) confirms the fact of the disaster to his army. For the mouse as a symbol of plague cf. 1 Sam. vi. 4-5 and Iliad, i. 39, where Apollo, as sender of plague, is invoked as 'Sminthian' (from smi/nqos, a mouse). There is an interesting Egyptian parallel in the vision of Ptah seen by Merneptah, before his victory over the Libyans and their allies (Breasted, iii. 582); 'but the form of the inscription e)s e)me/ and the pointing of the moral are both Greek' (Griffith, u. s.). Pelusium; cf. 154 n. Josephus (Ant. x. 14) says that H. recorded a siege of Pelusium by the Assyrians; this would naturally have come in here. Here, as elsewhere (cf. i. 24. 8), a votive offering has determined the form of the tradition. The statue had originally nothing to do with the events described, but represented the god Horus, to whom the mouse was sacred; the Greeks explained it from the legends of Apollo. Strabo (604) tells a story of mice eating sku/tina tw=n o(/plwn, at Amaxitus in the Troad, where (at Chryse) Apollo was commemorated by a statue of Scopas, with a mouse under his foot. Spiegelberg however (Z. A. S. 43, 94), thinks that the story was older than the statue, and was attached to this by Semitic settlers (cf. 112. 2 *turi/wn strato/pedon). Caps. 142-6 are a digression, before the history of the twentysixth (Saite) dynasty. H. urges three points, the two first of which he has already made: (1) the antiquity of Egypt (cf. 2. 1 n.); (2) the obligations of Greece to Egypt for its Pantheon (cf. cc. 49-50 nn.); (3) the mistaken views of the Greeks as to the human origin of their gods. The figure 341 H. obtains by calculation, i. e. he counts after Menes (c. 99) and 'the 330 kings enumerated from a roll' (100. 1 n.), the 10 kings whose reigns he describes (102-41), i. e. 1 + 330 + 10 = 341. He confirms his calculation by the list of High Priests at Thebes (143. 2). The calculation is worthless, for (1) even if we knew the source of the '330' and could trust it, many of the kings were contemporary with each other. (2) H.'s '10 kings' are counted twice over; they were already included in the '330'. (3) It is absurd to suppose that a king's reign averaged a generation (cf. i. 7. 4 for a lower estimate). (4) H. knew the priesthood was in his day hereditary (37. 5); but he had no right to assume it had always been so. Stein well compares the calculation with an attempt to estimate the duration of the Papacy from the portraits of the Popes at San Paolo. mu/ria. For this calculation cf. App. XIV. e)piloi/pwn. H. is wrong in his arithmetic; 41 x 33 1/3 = 1,366 2/3, i. e. 26 2/3 more years than he gives (cf. i. 32. 4 n. for another miscalculation). u(poloi/poisi: the Saite kings who ruled after Sethos. By these words H. means: 'the sun rose four times away from his previous quarter' (as he explains, e)/nqa te nu=n ... katadu=nai), i. e. had changed his place of rising four times, rising in the east for two periods and in the west for two. For belief in this phenomenon cf. Plato, Pol. 269A, who connects it with the story of Thyestes. H.'s own views about the sun (cc. 24-5) are quite as impossible. But H.'s Egyptian informant must have meant something different, i. e. that from Menes to Sethos there were four 'Sothis periods' (complete or incomplete) of 1,460 years each (cf. 4 nn.). Only at the beginning of a period did the time of the calendar correspond to the real time; hence the sun might be said to 'rise four times (only) from his proper place'. u(po\\ tau=ta, 'during this period' (cf. ix. 60. 3 for u(po/). H. refutes by implication his countrymen's beliefs in a Golden Age, in a Deluge, &c. This passage is important as illustrating (1) the fact that H. used the *gh=s peri/odos of Hecataeus as a guide-book. (2) His somewhat depreciatory tone to his predecessor. The word logopoio/s, however, is not itself contemptuous. (3) The origins of Greek chronology (cf. App. XIV. 4). e(kkaide/katon. The figure seems small; there were twenty generations from Leonidas, the contemporary of Hecataeus, to Zeus (vii. 204). e)o\\n me/ga. It is strange that H. only refers in this cursory manner to the gigantic buildings at Thebes (Karnak); this is one of the passages used by Sayce to prove that H. never went (p. xxvii) up the Nile beyond the Fay\u00fbm. Sayce also affirms (ib. and nn. here) that the statues seen by H. were at Memphis, not at Thebes; of this he gives no proof. (For his argument cf. 29 nn.) It may be taken as certain that H. had never been in the great pillared hall with its 140 columns; only high officials were admitted to this; but he may well have been in the chambers on the south of the great court. H. has been partially confirmed by M. Legrain's discovery of a number of statues at Karnak in 1904 and 1905; over 16,000 objects were taken out of a pit, of which 600 were statues; only some of these, however, were of priests, and wood was the exception, not the rule, as material. Cf. R. de T. xxvii. 67; xxviii. 148. Wood, however, is a material which perishes easily, and we may accept the summing up of Sourdille, who (H. E. pp. 190-8) discusses the whole subject fully, 'it is at least certain that many priests obtained permission to dedicate their statues, that some of these were of wood, that inscriptions enable to follow for generations the history of many families' (p. 198). H., in fact, as usual, generalizes too much from data correct in themselves. tosou/tous: i. e. 341 (142. 1); H. writes loosely, meaning a number corresponding to the number of kings. Hecataeus actually would have seen 345, for he visited Egypt some 140 years (i. e. four generations) after the time of Sethos (the 341st king). ou) deko/menoi: this is too absolute (cf. Sourdille, R. p. 56). The Pharaohs were by title the 'sons of Ra', and stories of divine fatherhood occur on the monuments, e. g. Amenophis III is son of Amon at Luxor. H., in fact, contradicts his own statement elsewhere (cf. i. 182. 1 nn.). In Egyptian, pi/rwmis = 'the man', here wrongly translated 'the gentleman'. The mistake spoils the point of the priests' answer, viz. that mortal had been born of mortal, without a god coming in, for this long period. Whether the mistake be due to the interpreter's vanity, or to H.'s desire to outdo the family distinctions of Hecataeus, must remain uncertain. 'Piromis,' as a proper name, may have been familiar to H., for it occurs in an inscription from Halicarnassus, l. 17 (Newton's Essays, p. 427, l. 17). toiou/tous: of human shape, and so mortals. Manetho (fr. 1) puts Horus last of the first set of god-rulers (145 n.), not, as H. here, just before mortal rule; by a similar mistake H. puts Osiris among the last set of god-rulers (145. 1). But the Turin Papyrus and the monuments alike put immediately before Menes the 'Horus worshippers' as rulers (Meyer, i. 192), which explains H.'s statement here. Horus, as the god of light, was identified with Apollo. For his story and that of Osiris cf. 62. 1 n.; for Osiris, also 42. 2 n. Caps. 145-6 must be read with cc. 43-5; they illustrate (1) H.'s pseudo-chronology for early times; (2) his fondness for correcting his countrymen; (3) above all his views on Egyptian religion. He divides the Egyptian pantheon into three classes, the eight original gods, the twelve others born from them, and a third series, of indeterminate number, born from the twelve. He seems to mean this as a classification of Egyptian gods in general (145. 1); but if this is his meaning, he is inconsistent, for he says elsewhere (c. 42) that only Isis and Osiris were worshipped by all the Egyptians. He further identifies these gods with the rulers of Egypt before the period of Menes (pro/teron tw=n a)ndrw=n tou/twn, 144. 2). The origin of his information may have been chiefly Memphis, for it is the temple of Ptah (Hephaestus) to which he continually refers (cf. App. X. 10); but he also refers to Mendes (46. 1). How far Egyptian tradition really underlies these statements of H. is disputed. Brugsch (Religion der Alten A. p. x) explains the 'eight' as corresponding to the eight original 'cosmogonic' deities, while the 'twelve' are made up by the addition of Thoth, the 'thought' of the original god personified, and of the divine Triad of Toum, Hathor, and Harpocrates (the father, mother, and son). H.'s third series of gods he explains as local gods, to whom 'special worships were founded after the pattern of the cosmogonic twelve (p. xi). It will be seen at once that, if this were the real Egyptian view, H. has reproduced it very inaccurately; but Maspero (M. A. E. ii, pp. 184-7, 237 seq.) rejects Brugsch's whole system as 'an attempt to get from polytheistic texts a monotheistic theology'. It must suffice to say here (1) that the usual division of the Egyptian pantheon was into three 'nines', of which the first was far the most important; the 'enneads' of Heliopolis were the best known; (2) that H. is wrong in putting Osiris in his third class (c. 145); he belonged to the great 'ennead'; (3) that he is right, according to Egyptian ideas, in making the gods to have been rulers of Egypt. Sourdille (cap. 2) criticizes H.'s views on Egyptian religion generally; he sums up: 'H.'s starting-point is really Egyptian (e. g. the threefold division), his development rests on conceptions entirely different' (p. 54). For the calculations and inconsistencies of this cap.cf.App.XIV.2. pro/sqe: cf. 43. 4. *(erme/w. The oldest authority for this scandal against the virtuous Penelope is Pindar (Serv. ad Georg. i. 16).

If the text be sound, however, a)mfote/rwn must mean 'the Greek and the Egyptian views'; translate 'A man can adopt whichever of these two', &c. a)pode/dektai: i. e. that Pan is the Egyptian god of Mendes (c. 46), and that Melampus brought the worship of Dionysus from Egypt (c. 49). ei) me\\n ga\\r ktl. H.'s argument is that the cases of Heracles on the one hand and of Dionysus and Pan on the other were not parallel (kata/ per *(h. ktl.). Heracles (c. 43) was the son of Amphitryon, who after a long life had been identified with an Egyptian god; but as to Pan and Dionysus, their stories (\u00a7 2) showed they had never existed as men. They had not become 'famous' (faneroi/) like Hercules, and so 'taken the names of gods who had existed before'. The Greeks therefore, he thinks, borrowed them from Egypt, and made the date of the introduction of their worship (a)p' ou(= e)pu/qonto ktl.) into the date of their birth. Stein ingeniously shows that this actually was done in the worship of Dionysus; Melampus, its mythical founder (49. 3), was a contemporary of Labdacus; for their respective great-grandsons, Amphiaraus (cf. Od. xv. 241 and the 'Seven against Thebes'. But Labdacus and Dionysus were contemporaries, as both grandsons of Cadmus; therefore to the Greek genealogers, Melampus would be a contemporary of Dionysus (cf. App. XIV. 2). e)n th= *ai)qiopi/h: in iii. 111. 1 H. says the Arabs say that cinnamon grows 'in the land where Dionysus was brought up' (i. e.

It is noticeable, however, that H. only gives the connexion between Dionysus and Ethiopia as the belief of Greeks and Arabs, not as his own.

H. rightly emphasizes the change in the character of his sources (147. 1; cf. 154. 4 and App. X. 10-11). a)/neu basile/os. H. for once drops his Egyptian sympathies and ironically says the natives 'though freed' could not get on 'without a king'. Diodorus (i. 66) calls the state of Egypt a)narxi/a. duw/deka. There is no trace of this 'dodecarchy' on the monuments; Diodorus (u. s.) repeats the figure, and adds that the twelve h(gemo/nes ruled fifteen years, and that the victory of Psammetichus was at Momemphis. H.'s story seems to correspond to the broad facts, though it has been made too symmetrical, and adorned with religious motives by his priestly informants at Buto. The number 'twelve' is probably a Greek interpolation; Maspero (iii. 488 n.), who compares the 'twelve great gods' (c. 43) which the Greek version gave, says the monuments give us the names of more than twenty petty rulers at this time. The rivalry of chiefs at this period in the Delta is illustrated by a contemporary demotic romance published in 1897 (cf. Petrie, iii. 321 seq.). Lying between the Assyrian and the Ethiopian conquerors (cf. App. II. 3; X. 9), they had gained a state of semi-independence. For Necho, perhaps the chief of them, cf. 152. 1 n. labu/rinqon. The name is Greek, perhaps connected with lau/ra (an 'alley'); for the connexion cf. Burrows, Discoveries in Crete, pp. 117 seq., 228, and v. 119. 2 n. It properly belongs to the great pre-hellenic palace of Knossus; as there was a direct connexion between Minoan civilization and the twelfth dynasty culture, the Greeks were justified in their comparison. The building here described by H. (also by Strabo 811) was originally built by Amenemh\u00eat III (101. 4 n.), and was continued by his daughter (queen 1791-1788); only their names have been found among the ruins, and no trace of the work of the twenty-sixth dynasty. H. is therefore wrong in attributing it to the 'twelve kings'; but most classical writers are also wrong (e. g. Strabo). Manetho (fr. 35; ii. 560), however, rightly gives it to a king of the twelfth dynasty, calling him 'Lamares' which seems to be one of the names of Amenemh\u00eat III (cf. Meyer, i. 281 n.). The 'Labyrinth' was considered one of the 'seven wonders of the world'; it was not only a temple, but also the seat of government; each nome had its own set of chambers in it. *krokodei/lwn ... po/lin. For this town cf. 69. 1. It lies close to the modern Med\u00eenet-el-Fay\u00fbm. Strabo (811) says the Labyrinth was 100 stadia from it. h)/dh, 'so far,' with lo/gou me/zw (cf. L. and S. s. v. I. 5). Although the Labyrinth has perished its foundations remain, and their area is 'enough to include all the temples of Karnak and Luxor' (Petrie, i. 188); they measure 1,000 feet by 800; it was identified by Petrie in 1888; for a description cf. his 'Hawara', E. E. F., 1889, pp. 5-8. For the temple at Ephesus cf. i. 92. 1 n., for that of Samos, iii. 60. 4 n., where H. says it was 'the greatest of all temples we know' (i. e. of Greek temples). For the bearing of this passage on the date of H.'s visit to Egypt cf. App. IX. 1. The chief differences between the accounts of H. and of Strabo are: (1) H. says there were twelve au)lai/, Strabo (787, 811) implies there were more\u2014one for each of thirty-six nomes; but he also seems to give the number as twenty-seven. (2) H. says the 'courts' had 'openings facing each (\u00a7 4), Strabo that they were e)f' e(/na sti/xon, and that they opened on a long wall. (3) H. says nothing distinct (but cf. \u00a7 7) of the absence of wood or of the monolithic roofs, Strabo nothing of the 'underground chambers' (\u00a7 5). It would be impossible to construct a building according to the description of either H. or Strabo; and it is obvious that a 'labyrinth' defies description, at any rate by a mere visitor led through part of it as was H. (\u00a7 5). It is therefore needless to attempt to account for the contradictions, &c., by supposed later additions to the Labyrinth during the 450 years between the visits of the two travellers. kata/stegoi. The courts were 'covered in', not open as usual; H. conceives them as arranged six a side, along a corridor, from which, being no doubt higher, they were lighted. Stein compares the pillared hall at Karnak, where also the walls and pillars are covered with 'figures carved on' (tu/pwn e)ggeglumme/nwn (\u00a7 7); cf. 136. 1). H. is right that the main feature of the building was the great number and the equal size (speaking generally) of its chambers; there was not the usual great central court, for it was not dedicated to any one deity (cf. Petrie, u. s. p. 7). stege/wn seems to be the same as oi)kh/mata just below, i. e. the minor 'chambers' as opposed to the 'courts'. ei(ligmoi/, 'the goings this 'chambers'. zw=|a, 'hieroglyphics'; cf. i. 70. 1 n. For the pyramid at Hawara cf. Petrie, i. 184 seq. Lake Moeris (for the name cf. 101 n.) 'was the natural basin of the Fay\u00fbm oasis, regulated and utilized by Amenemh\u00e9t III' (Petrie, i. 192, with whom Breasted, pp. 193-4, agrees). The Fay\u00fbm in its lowest parts is over 120 feet below the sea level, and was originally filled with water by the Nile; some parts of it, however, e. g. the site of Arsinoe, were inhabited even under the Old Empire, and more of it was reclaimed by the great kings of the twelfth dynasty, especially Amenemh\u00eat III. He also regulated the flow of the Nile, using the lake to hold the surplus of the high Nile, and then letting the water go as it was wanted. In fact his work was an anticipation of the Barrage and the dam at Assouan. Owing to the rise in height of the Nile valley on the east side, Lake Moeris gradually became useless for controlling the Nile flood, but the work of reclamation was greatly extended under the Ptolemies. Only the Birket Kar\u00fbn is now left, on the north-west of the district; this lake is thirty-four miles long. The topography of Lake Moeris was finally settled by Major Brown (The Fay\u00fbm and L. M., 1892); for a good summary cf. Grenfell and Hunt, Fay\u00fbm Towns (E. E. F., 1900, pp. 1-17); they say H.'s 'mistakes, such as they are, are those of an uncritical eyewitness'; while Strabo, on the other hand, claims to have seen what bad ceased to exist 200 years before his time (p. 8). Other views of Lake Moeris are briefly: (1) that of Linant (published 1843), who first explored the district, that Lake Moeris was on the east side of the Fay\u00fbm, held up by huge dykes. This, though long accepted, is now given up. (2) Maspero (p. 131) and Meyer (i. 293) both deny that the lake had anything to do with the regulation of the Nile flood. It will be noticed that H. says nothing as to this. e(cako/sioi kai\\ trisxi/lioi. This figure\u2014about 400 miles\u2014is much exaggerated; the size of Lake Moeris is estimated by Petrie (Hawara, p. 2) at about 130 miles; the coast-line is about 180 miles. *xeiropoi/htos. H. is wrong in calling the lake 'artificial'. Strabo (811) rightly says that it is a 'natural' (fusika/) reservoir, but that the sluices (klei=qra) by which the water is controlled were artificial. e)n me/sh. The nose of one of these colossi, which were not 'in the middle of the lake', but on its east edge, is in the Ashmolean at Oxford (Room II); it is in finely polished quartzite; their pedestals are still at Biahmu, 4 1/2 miles north of Med\u00eenet. They were statues of Amenemh\u00eat III, probably about 39 feet high, or, with their pedestals, 60 feet. H. had only seen the statues from Arsinoe across the lake, and had accepted the greatly exaggerated figures of his guide. (Petrie, Hawara, p. 60 and Pl. XXVI). Nissen (Metrologie, p. 889, in I. M\u00fc., Hand. der A. W. i) says that di/kaiai here = 'of full length', as opposed to the short stade of '148' metres used by H. in reckoning marches. But H. really seems always to reckon the stade at the same length, i. e. about 200 yards. di/kaiai/ ei)si really = i)/sai ei)si, i. e. The canal (diw/ruxa) is the Bahr Y\u00fbs\u00fbf, which leaves the Nile about 200 miles to the south, just below Si\u00fbt. Here as elsewhere (cf. App. IX. 1) the orderly arrangements for government seem to imply that the Persians were in peaceful possession of Egypt. Sayce (F. Petrie, Illahun, Kahun, 1891, pp. 40-1) gives a translation of a Ptolemaic papyrus as to the revenue from the 'fish-pots'. The interest of this chapter is the light that it throws on H.'s comparative method, and also on the date of his travels. It is natural to suppose that he heard the Nineveh story, presumably in Chaldaea, before he was in Egypt (cf. Intr. p. 5). tetramme/nh.

Sardanapallus, so far as he is historical, is Assurbanipal (cf. App. II. 3), the last of the Assyrian conquerors; Ctesias (Ass. fr. 15, p. 429) wrongly made him the last king of Nineveh, a compound of effeminacy and desperate bravery, as he is represented in Byron's drama. The story of the treasure-house is that of Rhampsinitus over again (cf. c. 121). This chapter obviously owes its colouring to Greeks; the fulfilment of an oracle by the persons who try to evade it is a common feature in these myths. kune/hn. The origin of this folk-tale is perhaps found in the name 'Psamtek'. This seems = 'son of a lion'; but it was also explained as 'drinking-bowl maker', Petrie, iii. 321. Stein, however (cf. 162. 1 n.), thinks Psammetichus was wearing the 'royal helmet', and incurred suspicion by using this for a libation. Manetho (fr. 66; F. H. G. ii. 593) gives three kings of the Saite dynasty before Psammetichus I; of these the third was Necho, father of Psammetichus; he represented one of the families which divided the rule of North Egypt; the centres of the other were Tanis and Bubastis (Maspero, iii. 378-9, 489). Necho is mentioned in Assurbanipal's Annals (R. P.1 i. 57 seq.; B. M. G. A. pp. 221-2, with picture of the cylinder) first among the twenty kings set up by Esarhaddon in Egypt (ib. 61); they were expelled by Taharka, but restored by Assurbanipal (p. 62). When they revolted against Assyria, Necho alone was restored to his throne (p. 64). There is no mention of his being killed by the Ethiopians, but it is probable. H., here as elsewhere (137. 1 n.), combines all the Ethiopian kings into one; for Necho is mentioned by Assurbanipal in 667 B. C., while Sabacos (Shabako) died before 700. Necho really fell before Tanut Amen, who shared the power of Taharka, the last of the four Ethiopian kings. Cf. for his stele Breasted, iv. 919 seq. xrhsmo/s. Under this oracular form is concealed the important part played by Greek mercenaries in the rise of the Saite dynasty. We learn from the Assyrian inscription (R. P.1 i. 69) that Gyges of Lydia sent help to Psammetichus, who was also encouraged to throw off the Assyrian yoke by the revolt of Babylon under Shamashsh\u00fbm\u00fbkin (Maspero, p. 572). kolossoi/. Egyptian architecture did not employ caryatides. H. means square columns adorned with a statue in front, probably of Osiris, as in the Ramesseum. For Epaphus cf. 38. 1 n. For the 'camps' at Pelusium and for the 'remains' there (\u00a7 5) cf. 30. 2 n.; for Bubastis, 59 n. The rivalry between Ionian and Carian made separate camps desirable. e(rmhne/es. The 'interpreters' formed one of the seven 'classes' (c. 164). Amasis came to the throne at the head of a native reaction (163. 2); he therefore removed the foreigners from their important post on the east frontier; but he saw that the support of the Greek mercenaries was necessary, and so attached them more closely to his own person. If we may trust a demotic chronicle in the Louvre, Amasis assigned the mercenaries some of the lands and revenues of the temples of Bubastis, Memphis, and Heliopolis (Revillout, R. E. i. 59); cf. iii. 16 n. For the double policy of Amasis, giving back with one hand what he had taken away with the other, cf. the treatment of Naucratis (178 nn.). Steph. Byz.

Maspero, iii. 537-8 nn.). prw=toi. For the Egyptian dislike of strangers cf. 91. 1; H. has never heard of the Hyksos (cf. App. X. 6) or of Libyan settlements in Egypt. o(lkoi/.

Each side of this shrine was a monolith, and a square of sixty feet (tou/toisi, 'in these respects,' i. e. height and length). These dimensions seem incredible, both on general grounds and because the shrine would be the same height as the portico.

The floating island is mentioned in fr. 284 of Hecataeus (F. H. the name, *xe/mbis, is nearer to the Egyptian 'Chebt' than the form here, *xe/mmis. It is hard to detect in this passage 'the mocking tone' towards his predecessor which Diels (Herm. xxii. 420) imputes to H. The idea of floating islands was familiar to the Greeks, e.g. Delos; a modern instance on a tiny scale is the island in Derwentwater; but it need hardly be said that the 'astonishment' of H. is justified. The Egyptians did not conceive of Bubastis as the sister of Horus; either H. himself infers the relationship from that of Apollo and Artemis, who were identified with them, or (more probably) he is telling a local Greek myth, heard by him in Egypt. It is interesting to note the confidence with which H. speaks of 'all preceding poets' (cf. vi. 52 n., Introd. \u00a7 18). Aeschylus is only mentioned by him here; the tragedy in question is lost; Pausanias (viii. 37. 6) repeats the charge. The harsh word h(/rpase may perhaps be significant of H.'s jealousy of Aeschylus, as being before him in his discovery of the relationship; it is more natural, however, to suppose that H. forgets his Orientalism, and speaks with resentment of a distortion of the usual Greek mythology. The long reign of Psammetichus is confirmed by Manetho (fr. 66; ii. 593) and by the monuments. For his portrait cf. B. M. Egyptian Saloon, No. 20. The capture of Ashdod, though not recorded on the monuments, is historical. Egypt had learned the danger of having Assyria as her immediate neighbour; now that power was breaking up, it was the policy of the Saites to extend their influence over Syria. The length of the siege, however, is a difficulty; it has been explained as a confusion in tradition, i.e. Psammetichus is made to take after 'twenty-nine years' the town which he really took in the twenty-ninth year of his reign. But this is pure conjecture, and it is more probable that Psammetichus took advantage of the Assyrian weakness caused by the Scythian inroad (i. 105 n.), in which case his aggression in Syria would belong to his later years. The figure 'twenty-nine' is probably an exaggeration due to Egyptian inaccuracy. diw/ruce. Necho's naval projects were part of his scheme of resistance to the new power of Babylon, which had risen on the ruins of Assyria. The cities of Phoenicia were always hostile to the great Eastern empires, and it was obvious that the naval force of Egypt would be doubly effective in supporting them, if the Red Sea fleet could join that of the Mediterranean. We may compare the increase in the power of Germany due to the Kiel canal. The Nile canal was first made by Sethos I (nineteenth dynasty, 1326-1300 B. C.; cf. Petrie, iii. 13); it was represented in one of the scenes in the hall at Karnak. It had, however, silted up by Necho's time. The work of Darius is confirmed by inscriptions (Hogarth, A. and A. p. 184) found between the Bitter Lakes and the Red Sea; Darius says, 'I ordered to dig this canal from the Nile which flows in Egypt to the sea which begins with Persia. This canal was dug' (Weissbach and Bang, 1893; Die Alt-Pers. Keilinsch. p. 39; Meyer, iii. 60 adopts this view); the inscription was formerly translated in the opposite sense, to mean that Darius gave up his work (so Pr\u00e1[sbreve]ek, ii. 111). The canal was again rendered navigable under the Ptolemies, and with some variation of direction by Trajan (but this is uncertain); it finally was closed in the eighth century A. D. The remains of the canal at Belb\u00eas show that it was some 50 yards wide and 16 to 17 feet deep; cf. vii. 24 (the Mount Athos canal) for the breadth\u2014'two triremes abreast'. h)=ktai. It was from the Nile to the Bitter Lakes; here it turned almost at a right angle, following thenceforward pretty much the line of the Suez Canal. The part of it running west and east was on the line of the 'Fresh Water Canal' (dug 1858-63); it was made along the natural depression, the Wadi T\u00fbmil\u00e2t, through which Lord Wolseley advanced in the Tel el Kebir campaign of 1882. Patumus is the Pithom of Exod. i. 11, about ten miles west of Ismailia, the Egyptian Pi-t\u00fbm\u00fb (i. e. place of the god T\u00fbm\u00fb), and has been excavated by Naville (E. E. F., 1903, 4th ed.). For 'Arabian' cf. 8. 1 ('the Arabian Mountain'), for the geography generally 8. 3 n. katu/perqe in both cases = 'south of'. The *)a. depending on make ta\\ pro\\s *)arabi/hn e)/xonta almost equivalent participle = 'extending'. a)parti/. H. repeats this 'exact' figure (which = about 115 miles) in iv. 41, but it is too great; the narrowest part of the isthmus is only seventy miles 'from sea to sea'. Strabo (803) gives '1,000 stades' from Pelusium to the Red Sea; this road measure may be the cause of H.'s mistake. But Posidonius made it even greater, putting the breadth at 'less than 1,500 stades'. The figure '120,000' is doubtless exaggerated; Mehemet Ali lost only 10,000 in making the Mahm\u00fbdieh Canal (from the Nile to Alexandria). Strabo (804) says the canal was stopped by Necho's death. H. is perhaps anachronistic in making Necho's fleet (in the seventh century) all 'triremes'; but Thucydides (i. 13. 2) says triremes were built at Corinth in 704 B. C., and the Cypselids were connected with the Saite dynasty (cf. the name 'Psammetichus' among them). e)n tw=| de/onti, 'as he needed them'; it would have been natural to mention here the story of the circumnavigation of Africa (iv. 42 nn.). *magdw/lw|. The battle was really fought at Megiddo, where the coast-road comes out on the plain of Esdraelon: here Thothmes III had beaten the Syrian confederates nearly 1,000 years before. H. confuses this name with 'Migdol', the border fortress of Egypt on the north-east (cf. Exod. xiv. 2; Jer. xliv. 1). e)ni/khse. The 2 Kings xxiii and 2 Chron. xxxv. The 'good' Josiah was of the Prophets' party, which urged submission to the powers of the Euphrates valley; there was, however, always a philo-Egyptian party in Judaea. *ka/dutin. Only mentioned here and in iii. 5. 1, where H. describes it as 'about the size of Sardis' (Hec. frs. 261-2 speaks of *ka/nutis and *ka/rdutos). It has been identified with Jerusalem, and its name explained as = 'the holy' (cf. the present Arab name 'El Kods'); Necho perhaps took Jerusalem (2 Chron. xxxvi. 3). But it is clear from iii. 5 that Cadytis was on the coast, at the south end of the road from Phoenicia to Egypt; and H.'s comparison with Sardis. which may rest on his own observation, would certainly not suit Jerusalem, in the days of humiliation after the return from the Exile. Gaza, on the other hand (certainly captured by Necho), was always an important station of the trade-route from Egypt to Syria, and had special connexion with Arabia; cf. G. A. Smith, Hist. Geog. 182-3. Some consider that H. is wrong in placing the capture of Gaza in this campaign; Maspero, however, thinks that it was taken on Necho's return from the Euphrates (cf. Jer. xlviii. 2, 'the flood from the north,' which overwhelms the Philistines). It is noticeable that H. knows nothing of the defeat at Carchemish (604 B. C.; cf. Jer. xlvi. 2) which Nebuchadnezzar inflicted on Necho. e)sqh=ti. This dedication was a compliment to his mercenaries, many of whom were Carian. The Branchidae temple (cf. i. 46. 2 n. had been plundered by the Persians before the birth of H. (v. 36. 3), but there is no need to suppose that he got this fact from Hecataeus. e(kkai/deka. Manetho gives Necho only six years (frs. 66-7: F. H. G. ii. 593-5); funeral monuments, however, in the museums of Florence and Leyden confirm H., showing that Necho died in the sixteenth year of his reign. Some (needlessly) try to reconcile the two figures by making Necho rule nine years as regent with his father. Psammis is called on the monuments Psamtik (like his grandfather), by Manetho (u. s.) ya/mmouqis. His coffin (now in the museum at Gizeh) is too small for an adult (Z. A. S. xxii. 80); the early death thus implied agrees with his short reign. His most important act was an expedition against Ethiopia (161. 1); it is to this that the graffiti at Abusimbel belong (cf. 154. 4 n.). The story of the Eleans (transferred by Diod. i. 95 to Amasis) is interesting as showing how completely the Greeks had the English ideas of 'sportsmanship', and how strange these were to other nations; for the impartiality of the Eleans cf. the repartee of Agis in Plut. Mor. kai\\ ei)/kosi. Manetho (fr. years, i. e. 589-570 B. C.; but he reigned nominally with Amasis for three years (c. 169 n.). H.'s 'twenty-five' is by any reckoning excessive. *turi/w|. After the second capture of Jerusalem (586 B. C.) Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre in vain for thirteen years. On the retirement of the Babylonian, Apries' fleet gained the victories here spoken of; this early success of sea-power is more probable than Josephus' story (x. 11) that Nebuchadnezzar conquered Egypt and killed the king 'in the twenty-third year of his reign' (i. e. 582-581); the Jewish historian probably misinterpreted the prophecies (cf. Jer. xliii. 8-13 and Ezek. xxx. 10-19). Nebuchadnezzar, however, in a fragmentary inscription (for which cf. 27. 2 n.), mentions a campaign, perhaps victorious, against Amasis in 568 B. C., and Wiedemann thinks that Egypt was overrun by the Chaldaeans as far as Syene; to this invasion he referred the inscription of Nesuhor (cf. 30. 1 n.), and he still maintains his view, though the Nesuhor inscription has been proved to refer to a revolt of an Egyptian garrison and not with a Chaldaean war. The question must be left open (as by Meyer, i.1 497); on the one hand the silence of H. as to such a defeat is easily explicable by the vanity of his Egyptian informants, and Egypt would have been an easy prey, being weak from internal divisions (cc. 162-3); on the other hand, the prosperity of the reign of Amasis renders a Chaldaean conquest unlikely. profa/sios = 'cause' (i. 29. 1). For the fulfilment of this promise cf. iv. 159; the 'cause' was the offered alliance of the Libyan tribes against Cyrene; Apries, true to the policy of his family, was extending his hold along the Mediterranean coast. No doubt Apries sent his 'Egyptian' troops, because his Greek ones could not be trusted against Greeks. The contemporary inscription (169 n.) seems to confirm H. as to the motives of the Egyptian army; 'Haunebu (Greeks), one knows not their number, are traversing the North land . . . he (Apries) hath summoned them' (King and Hall, p. 434). kune/hn. The royal 'helmet' is familiar on the monuments. The whole conspiracy has considerable resemblance to Jehu's (2 Kings ix); but the superiority of the Jewish narrative in dignity and vividness is marked (cf. 141. 3 n.). Momemphis lay on a canal from the Canopic (the western) arm of the Nile to the Mareotic Lake. For the rivalry of Egyptians and natives cf. 154. 3 n. Marea was the frontier post on the west (30. 2 n.). ge/nea. H. states his belief in the Egyptian caste system still more clearly in vi. 60, and it was generally believed among the Greeks, though the actual divisions vary, e. g. Plato (Tim. 24) gives three, i(erei=s, dhmiourgoi/, and ma/ximoi, of whom the dhmiourgoi/ nomei=s, qhreutai/, and gewrgoi/; Diodorus (i. 73-4) gives the same division, putting texni=tai the qhreutai/ (cf. also Isoc. Bus. 15-16; Strabo 787; all, however, make the priests and the military the two first). The Greek belief was too systematized; as a matter of fact there was no strict division of hereditary castes; members of the same family could belong to different classes. But it is true that certain functions were hereditary (e. g. Brugsch enumerates fourteen royal architects in succession from one family at this period), and that the 'soldiers' and the 'priests' were separated from the mass of the people; so too were certain degraded callings, e. g. that of swineherd (47. 1). Possibly the hereditary tendency grew stronger in the last days of Egyptian independence, under the Saite reaction (Meyer, i.1 470-1). oi( ma/ximoi. Maspero (iii. 499 seq.) thinks that this organization was the work of Psammetichus after the desertion of his warriors (30 n.); also that the Hermotybies represented his hereditary supporters, and were perhaps of Libyan origin, while the Calasiries were pure Egyptians and had been supporters of the rival house in the Egyptian Delta. The names given by H., however, do not altogether bear out this division, e. g. that of Nathos is placed by Stein in the Egyptian Delta. It is impossible to settle the question, for several of the nomes are differently identified, e.g. those of Chemmis and Papremis (63. 1 n. and iii. 12), and some names in the second list are otherwise unknown. Three points as to the division are probable: (1) it did not include the Greek mercenaries. Hence Gutschmid's view must be rejected that the name *labarei=s, given by Aristagoras (Steph. Byz. s. v.) to the Hermotybies, is connected with Labara in Caria; (2) that it lasted till Persian times, cf. ix. 32. 1 for the divisions in Mardonius' army; (3) the organization was, at least mainly, for Northern Egypt. 'Thebes' (166. 1) alone represents Upper Egypt. The strength and the danger of the Saites alike lay in the Delta. Spiegelberg (Z. A. S. 1906, xliii. 87-90) says both *kalasi/ries and *(ermotu/bies are = 'young men' 'riders' respectively; *kalasi/ries was used originally of Nubian troops; but in H.'s day the old sense was forgotten, and both names were applied to infantry. From the *kalasi/ries the 'fringed robe' (81. 1) derived its name, but h(mitu/bion ('apron', Aristoph. Plut. 729) is a Greek word, not Egyptian (as Poll. vii. 71 wrongly says). nomw=n. This division dates from a very early period, Breasted (p. 30) says from pre-dynastic times; it lasted till Roman times. 'The nomes were sharply distinguished by religion, customs, and historical development', Meyer, i. 177. Under the Old and the Middle Kingdoms, the power of the nomarchs had become largely hereditary. For a list of the nomes and an account of their organization cf. Maspero, pp. 25 seq., or B. M. G. pp. 16-17, but H.'s lists correspond to neither. The number is variously given by Greek writers; the Egyptians sometimes fix it at forty-four, twenty-two for each part of Egypt. For the nomes cf. Steindorf, Die \u00e4gyptischen Gaue (1909), who thinks the divisions varied greatly at different periods (cf. C. R. xxv. 56). *xemmi/ths. The position of this nome between 'Saite' and 'Papremite' seems to show it was in the Delta, and connected with the island (c. 156) in the Buto lake, not with the town in the Theban nome (c. 91). The number 160,000, like the '250,000' of c. 166, is excessive. It is probably only an instance of the weakness of ancient statistics; Wiedemann, however, accepts it as including not only the standing army, but the reserves of 'veterans', &c., who were settled in the soldier nomes, and who could be called up, if necessary, for land defence. H. is the founder of the comparative method for the study of politics, but he has made enough progress with it to see that a prejudice against handicraft, being common to almost all nations in a primitive stage, is not, of necessity, a proof of borrowing. The only thing he is sure of is (cf. d' w)=n = 'at any rate') that the Greek prejudice is general; for it cf. Arist. Pol. vii. 4. 6; 1326 A the ba/nausoi are not a real part of the city, and vii. 12. 3; 1331 A the ba/nausos is not to come unsummoned to the e)leuqe/ra a)gora/. In Laconia the manual arts were practised by Perioeci; cf. Strabo 382 for the te/xnai dhmiourgikai/ of Corinth. ge/rea: for the corresponding privileges of the priests cf. c. 37. Diodorus (i. 73) says that one-third of the land was set apart for the warrior caste; each warrior received his allotment, which returned to the general stock on his death (cf. 168. 2 ou)dama\\ w(utoi/). In the Revenue Laws of Ptolemy Philadelphus (3rd cent. B. C.; edited by Grenfell, 1896), the land is measured in a)/rourai as here. ph=xus. Cf. i. 178. 3 n. where H. distinguishes the 'royal' from the ordinary cubit, as being three fingers longer. The Egyptian (i. e. Samian) cubit was 525 millimetres, the 'royal' 532.8. e)n peritroph=: cf. iii. 69. 6. The land was held on a sort of feudal tenure. a)/lloi: if this is read (vide app. crit.) it must mean 'another thousand'. a)rusth/r = kotu/lh, i. e. nearly half a pint. H.'s account is shown to be very incomplete by a contemporary inscription which is unfortunately much mutilated and variously restored (cf. Petrie, iii. 351, and Breasted, iv. 996 seq.); it describes the battle as fought in the 'third year' of Amasis. H. has blended in one two defeats of Apries; he had been allowed nominally to continue on the throne (the joint rule is marked by various monuments); then he rebelled with the Greek mercenaries, and was killed. Cf. 161. 4 n. H. is correct in saying that he received royal burial, and that there was an interval between his first defeat and his death. For the proud confidence of Apries cf. Ezek. xxix. 3. The Egyptians were fond of imitating plants in the capitals of their columns; the lotus and the papyrus on these are more common than the palm; cf., for a popular account, Baedeker, cxxxiii seq. (with illustrations). tou= i(rou=. In iii. 16. 1 Amasis' tomb seems to be in the palace. Probably temple and palace formed one continuous building; cf. 130. 1, where the sacred cow at Sais is in 'a chamber of the palace'. dica\\ qurw/mata. Some translate a double table or platform (cf. qu/rh, 96. 4); but probably 'a double door', i. e. a door with two leaves. ou)k o(/sion. The reference is to Osiris (cf. 3. 2, 86. 6 nn.). There were graves of Osiris (the Greek 'Serapea') all over Egypt, wherever parts of his body had been found (62 n.); another explanation was that Isis buried coffins of Osiris in many places to deceive Typhon (Strabo 803). These stories are late inventions; the real explanation is that as the cult of Osiris became a sort of general worship in Egypt, various local deities were identified with him. li/mnh. Such artificial pools were common in Egyptian temples; over them the funeral bark was rowed in grand funerals. The pool at Delos, to the north of Apollo's temple, has been discovered in the recent French explorations there (cf. P. W. iv. 2471). H. had clearly been in Delos before his Egyptian visit. musth/ria. For the real meaning of these cf. Farnell, G. C. iii. 130-1. In Egypt and in Greece alike they were marked by the four elements of secrecy, sacrifice, dramatic mimicry, and the communication of a i(ero\\s lo/gos. But some, including H. probably, and certainly Plutarch (I. et O. 35; Mor. 364), have thought that they contained also doctrines of great importance, e.g. as to immortality; this is very doubtful. Cf., for the relations of Greece and Egypt in this matter, Sourdille, R. pp. 305-6, and for the supposed derivation of the Eleusinian mysteries from Egypt, Farnell, iii. 141-2 (who rejects the view, cf. 42. 2 n. for a similar theory). For a description of Osiris rites cf. cc. 61, 62 nn. eu)/stoma kei/sqw: probably a fragment of an old hymn. The *qesmofo/ria was really a feast of the sowing time; it was celebrated in Attica from the 10th to the 13th of Pyanepsion (end of Oct.). H. also speaks of it at Ephesus (vi. 16. 2); and it was at the *qesmofo/rion (vi. 134. 2) of Paros that Miltiades was seized with his mysterious panic. The festival was that of married women only; for it cf. B. B. Rogers, Thesmophoriazusae, Introd., or Farnell, G. C. iii. 85 seq.; for similar festivals cf. v. 61. 2. H. derives it from Egypt because he identifies Isis with Demeter; to Isis, as to Demeter *qesmofo/ros, was attributed the introduction of agriculture and settled law (Diod. i. 14); but it is not likely the worships were connected; similar rites arise independently in different races. For Danaus cf. 91. 5 n., for H.'s views on Pelasgians App. XV, for Es-Seffeh, Sais; hence Amasis is often called 'Saite'. dhmo/thn. The monuments speak of Amasis as brother-in-law of Apries; but he may have been a 'man of the people', and this connexion formed after his accession. The story of the 'foot-pan' is referred to in Aristotle (Pol. i. 12. 2; 1259 B) and frequently elsewhere, especially in patristic literature; it is purely Greek, alike in the political and in the social ideas underlying it. H. in iv. 181. 3 gives a fourfold division of the day, o)/rqros, a)gorh=s plhquou/shs (vii. 223), mesambri/h, a)poklinome/nhs h(me/rhs; from (a)gorh=s dialu/sios) it is clear that 'market time' was about 9 to 11 a.m. me/xri o(/teu = me/xris, cf. i. 181. 3. ta\\ tendit Apollo' (Hor. Odes, ii. 10. 19). Greek fancy wove a web of legends round Amasis, as round Croesus and many other historical persons of the sixth century (cf. i. 29. 1; App. I, \u00a7 9). H. as usual avoids the exaggerations of later writers, e. g. that Amasis was a great magician. His account is confirmed by a fragmentary demotic chronicle (cf. 154 n. and R. E. i. 66 seq.). The character of Amasis would appear the more shocking to his subjects, as the Egyptian king was a religious person, whose life was a round of regular routine (cf. Diod. i. 70 for his obligations, a sketch which Diodorus rightly says (69 ad fin.) is based on native records). The repetition of the subject o(/ ge is Homeric. The stories in this chapter also are Greek in their mixture of knavery and shrewdness. The behaviour of Amasis may be compared to that of Prince Hal, as Henry V, to Chief Justice Gascoigne and to Falstaff in 2 Henry IV, v (scenes 2, 5). Only huge mounds now remain at Sais which mark the ancient inclosure; but H.'s description is confirmed by Champollion, who says, 'this \"circonvallation de g\u00e9ants\" surpasses in height the largest works of the same kind.' The colossi stood before the portal, the sphinxes guarded on each side the approach. H. rightly notes that in Egypt the sphinx (unlike the monster of Oedipus) had a man's head. The reality of such creatures was firmly believed; Strabo (775) quotes Artemidorus that among the Troglodytes there are sphinxes, dogheaded men, and other marvels. ei)/kosi: for this estimate cf. 9. 2 n. For the red granite quarries of Syene cf. 29. 1 n. As the shrine was lying on its side, H. has given the height as length, and the breadth as height. A smaller monolith chamber of Amasis still exists at Thmuis in the Delta, about 23 feet high, 13 wide, and 11 1/2 deep (for picture cf. Maspero, iii. 643). Maspero, iii. 641, gives a picture of an Osiris lying on his stomach with head raised, which may perhaps give an idea of this 'recumbent colossus'; the statuette, however, is only about 6 inches high. Wiedemann thinks H. means the colossus had never been raised into position; but this is not what he says. Strictly u(/ption must = 'on its back'. eu)daimonh=sai. The age of Amasis, as the last king of independent Egypt, was a golden age; Diodorus (i. 31) gives the number of 'considerable villages and towns in old times' as over 18,000, and as over 30,000 under Ptolemy Lagus. qana/tw|. This law, 'the most drastic poor law on record,' is a great exaggeration of the Egyptian custom of taking a sort of census of inhabitants and their occupations; but such a punishment for idleness is impossible, though Plutarch (Sol. 17) says that at Athens Draco made death the punishment for a)rgi/a, and that Solon, here as elsewhere, modified his severity. Pollux (viii. 42) gives the penalty as a)timi/a, and some (e.g. Theophrastus, Plut. Sol. 31) transfer the law to Pisistratus, who did his best to encourage industry (*)aq. *pol. c. 16). The law, in its milder form, is in the spirit of Solonian legislation, as shown in his law that all sons were to be taught a trade (Plut. Sol. c. 24); but if it had anything to do with him, it could not have been borrowed from Amasis, who became king 570 B. C., more than twenty years after Solon's legislation (cf. App. XIV. 6). There was a law against idleness later at Athens (cf. Demosth. in Eubul. p. 1308, 37). e)s ai)ei/ simply means 'they follow it still', a statement which, though untrue, H. may well have believed. In this chapter (as in c. 154) there is a contradiction as to the policy of Amasis; he gains the throne at the head of a native reaction, and yet is a 'philhellene'. Probably both aspects of his policy are true, and their fundamental and inevitable inconsistency ruined at once his reputation (cc. 172-4 nn.) and his country; the Saites depended on foreign arms to defend Egypt (iii. 11), and yet these very defenders were hated by the Egyptians. It may be added that H. probably derived much information from the Greeks of Naucratis; to them at any rate Amasis was an undoubted benefactor. Among the Hellenic friends of Amasis were Solon (cf. 177), Polycrates (iii. 39), and Pythagoras (introduced to by Polycrates), Diog. Laert. viii. 1. 3. e)/dwke *nau/kratin. This passage raises two distinct questions: (1) Did the Greeks settle at Naucratis before the time of Amasis? (2) When did H. think they settled there? To take (2) first. This passage by itself might mean that the colony at Naucratis dated from Amasis; many, e. g. Hogarth (B. S. A. v. 46), think this the 'natural interpretation'. But H. (135. 1, 5) implies the earlier presence of a Greek community at Naucratis, and his whole story of the Saites implies that the Greeks had free access to Egypt before the limitations of Amasis. H.'s authority then is at least doubtful as to the date of Naucratis. As to well be a piece of genuine tradition, that Miletus took a prominent part in assisting Psammetichus; Inarus would be one of his rivals, possibly one of 'the dodecarchy'. For further evidence that Miletus founded Naucratis cf. Athen. vii. 283; for the Greeks in Egypt before Amasis cf. c. 154 nn. and Steph. Byz. s. v.*(ellhniko/n. The archaeological evidence is variously interpreted. Petrie and E. A. Gardner, who explored the site in 1884-6, held that the early date was proved, E. E. F. 1886-8, Naucratis; cf. P. Gardner, N. C. G. H. pp. 187 seq.; on the other hand, Hogarth, who resumed the digging in 1899, maintains that nothing had been found inconsistent with the later date, of about 570 B. C., which Hirschfeld and others had always maintained on epigraphical evidence (for this cf. Roberts, Greek Epigraphy, pp. 159 seq., 323 seq.). The site of Naucratis was conclusively identified by Petrie at Neb\u00eereh on a canal from the Canopic Nile, outside the Delta. The Hellenion was identified by Petrie with an enclosure capable of holding 50,000 men, to the south of Naucratis (cf. P. Gardner, u.s., pp. 209-10 for a description); this, however, was in the Egyptian quarter of the town, and was probably a native fort to overawe the strangers. The real site was discovered in 1899 on the north of the town (B. S. A. v. 42 seq.). In this were found a number of dedications to qeoi=s toi/s *(ellh/nwn or *(ellhni/ois; this unusual form marks the composite character of the colony, which was forced into unity in face of their barbarian neighbours; cf. v. 49. 3, 92. h 5 for the only other uses of *(ellh/nios in plur., both in impassioned appeals to Greek sentiment. The lists here are interesting as indicating the comparative commercial importance of Greek towns in the seventh century; it is to be noted that Aegina is the only representative of old Greece. *(ro/dos: the towns of Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus, not synoecized till 408 B. C. prosta/tas: these were the 'consuls' or trade representatives of the towns; the magistrates of the city were perhaps called timou=xoi (Hermias, F. H. G. ii. 80-1, an interesting passage as to the feast to the Grynean Apollo in the prytaneum at Naucratis). The officers of the towns probably stood to the magistrates as the heads of the trade-guilds to the authorities of a mediaeval town. o(/sai de\\ a)/llai: religious and trade privileges were closely connected. to\\ palaio/n: in the days of Amasis, as contrasted with H.'s own day.

For the burning of the Delphic temple cf. i. 50. 3 n. H., by adding au)to/matos here, refutes, perhaps intentionally, the story that it was set on fire by the Pisistratidae (Philochorus, fr. 70; F. H. G. i. 395). e)pe/balle: impersonal here with a construction like e)/dee; used personally it takes the dative. stupthri/hs. The Egyptian 'alum' was the best; it was used in dyeing; Wiedemann suggests that it was used for making the wood fireproof. Stein thinks that a)rguri/ou is to be supplied to mne/as: more probably H. intends to contrast the liberality of the king with the meanness of the Greeks. The alliance with Cyrene was a natural reversal of the policy of Apries. Wiedemann says the story of the marriage is a fabrication; his reasons are: (1) The uncertainty as to the bride's parentage (but this really confirms the story's accuracy; a fiction would have left no doubt on the subject). (2) The improbability that Cambyses would give up a valuable hostage, when intending to attack Cyrene. (3) The fact that Ladike is not mentioned on the monuments. It is always dangerous to reject a well-authenticated tradition on merely a priori grounds; Maspero, iii. 646, accepts it. *ba/ttou. Stein thinks Battus II, 'the happy,' who came to the throne about 574 B. C. (iv. 159), is meant; but the dependent position of Ladike seems to agree rather with the circumstances of Battus III, iv. 161. a)polwle/nai. The tense expresses proleptically the certain doom.

It was no doubt the work of a Greek artist. We may compare the Egyptian portraits in the National Gallery (nos. 1260-70), though these are of the second or third century A. D. qw/rhka. For the corselet cf. iii. 47. 3 n.; the groundwork was linen threads with 'figures (zw=|a) embroidered in gold and cotton'; cf. Ezek. linen Egypt'. *(/hrh. For the Heraeum cf. iii. 60. 4. *li/ndon. The real reason for this dedication was that the usual trade-route from the Aegean to Egypt was by Rhodes (cf. c. 178; Thuc. viii. 35. 2) and Cyprus. Phaselis (178. 2) was important on this route. *ku/pron. H. knew nothing of the conquest by Sargon, 709 B. C. (5. 104 n.); Amasis was the 'first' Egyptian to conquer Cyprus. As H. introduces his long digression on Egypt with a reference to the conquest of the Greeks (c. 1. 2), so he skilfully concludes with a similar reference. BOOK III The dh/ refers back to ii. 1, after the long digression on Egypt. The personal motive is characteristic of H. (cf. Introd. p. 45); the alliance of Egypt with Lydia (i. 77) and mere lust of conquest (i. 153. 4) were fully sufficient causes for the attack on Egypt. For the Egyptian doctors cf. 129. 2 (their failure against Democedes) and ii. 84. The law that the Persian king should only marry from the families of 'the Seven' (84. 2 n.) may not yet have been passed; but Amasis knew his daughter would be regarded as a sort of captive; the chief wives were always Persian. The story that Cambyses was the son of an Egyptian princess was given by Dinon (fl. circ. 360 B. C.) and Lyceas of Naucratis (F. H. G. ii. 91; iv. 441); that of H. in cap. 1 is even more incredible; a daughter of Apries would have been at least 40 in 529 B. C.; Ctesias (fr. 8, p. 225) for once agrees with H. The story of c. 2 is due to the vanity of a conquered nation (as H. saw), claiming a share in its conqueror (cf. App. IV. 4); but all the variants are probably derived from Egyptians, who wished that their own country should have a share in suggesting its own conquest. The princess is the heroine of Ebers' famous romance, Eine \u00e4egyptische K\u00f6nigstochter. No doubt the story of Phanes was familiar to H. from his childhood; the name (which is not a common one) is read on a vase found in many fragments (now in the B. M.) by Petrie (Naukratis, 1886; E. E. F., p. 55, pl. 33). *)arabi/wn basile/a. H. wrongly considers the Arabians as one nation; Cambyses' ally would be simply a powerful chief. For the dangers of this desert cf. the sufferings of the retreating French in 1799 (Lanfrey, i. 297). A unique coin found at Halicarnassus and now in the British Museum bears the inscription faeno\\s e)mi\\ sh=ma, 'I am the sign of Phanes.' It is at least as early as 525 B. C., and may have been struck by the mercenary captain to pay his men. But it is more usually connected with Ephesus, and the inscription is then translated 'I am the sign of the bright one'; cf. Head, H. N. p. 571. For Kadytis cf. ii. 159 n. The Palestine Syrians are here distinguished by H. from the Phoenicians (so too in ii. 104); their lands also are distinguished in i. 105 (probably), iii. 91. 1, and iv. 39. 2; in ii. 106. 1 he applies the term to include the coast north of Mount Carmel. But the most important reference is vii. 89, where H. distinguishes the 'Syrians in Palestine' from the Phoenicians, and then goes on (\u00a7 2) to use 'Palestine' of all the coast land, including Phoenicia, 'as far as Egypt'. He never uses it of Phoenicia alone. Here he means 'Philistines', who were still powerful in his time (Zech. ix. 5); it is true that he says they were circumcised (ii. 104. 3), but he says (ib.) the same of Phoenicians. Either the neighbouring tribes had begun to copy the Jews in this rite, or H. confuses the Jews and the coast peoples. He cannot have meant by the 'Palestine Syrians' 'the Jews' only, for they were at this time very unimportant. The ancient geographers did not usually extend 'Arabia' to the Mediterranean, nor does H. himself in iv. 39. He means here that the ends of the trade routes from Arabia to the Mediterranean were under Arabian control (cf. iii. 107 seq. for this spice trade); he writes tou= *)arabi/ou, 'in possession of the Arabian,' not th=s *(arabi/hs, For the Arabs of South Palestine as dependent allies (not subjects) of the Persians cf. 88. 1 n. Jenysus must have been a little further from Egypt than the once important port of Rhinocolura (Strabo 781), as Titus marched from Pelusium (a day west of Mount Casius) to Rhinocolura in three days (Joseph. B.J. iv. 11. 5), and H. allows 'three days' from Mount Casius to Jenysus. Its name has been traced in 'Khan J\u00fbnes', the traditional site of the casting-up of Jonah; but this is too far from Egypt, and its name 'resting place of Jonah' obviously dates from Mahometan times. For Mount Casius and the Serbonian Lake cf. ii. 6. 1 n. The Egyptians called the Serbonian Lake *tufw=nos e)kpnoai/ (Plut. Ant. was placed by Homer, Il. ii. 783ei)n *)ari/mois\u2014probably in Cilicia. Afterwards his burial place was transferred to Etna (Pind. Ol. iv. 11), and to other volcanic regions. When he was identified with the Egyptian Set (ii. 144. 2 n.), it was also placed in Egypt. The 'demarchs' were local headmen, under the nomarchs (cf. ii. 177. 2 n., and for the nome names ii. 164 n.). H.'s story is confirmed by the name 'Ostrakine' (Joseph. u. s. which, lying half-way between Mount Casius and Rhinocolura, was 'waterless'. Steindorf in 1904, visiting the oasis of Siwah, came upon a collection of broken pottery which he thought might be the remains of a water store such as that described here. palaio/n: sc.ke/ramon.

The number '7' is of course sacred. For stones as a witness cf. Gen. xxxi. 45-8, 'Galeed', and Josh. xxiv. 26-7. On the whole of this passage, so important anthropologically, cf. Robertson Smith, R. S. pp. 315-16, and Tylor, P. C. ii. 381. By the mixture of blood the stranger was admitted to fellowship with the tribe, or if an Arab of a different clan (a)sto/s), to fellowship with the clan. No doubt, in the rite originally, the parties tasted each other's blood; the idea was that 'the blood is the life'. The gods appealed to are in H. the common gods of the race; but the touching of the stones goes back to an earlier time, when 'the new tribesman has to be introduced to the god' (of the particular tribe). For other instances of blood covenant cf. Lydia, i. 74, Scythia, iv. 70, Armenia, Tac. Ann. xii. 47, and, among the Balonda on the Zambesi, Livingstone, Travels (1855), p. 488. tw=n trixw=n th\\n kourh/n. For the Arab hair cutting cf. Jer. ix. 26 R. V. 'those that have the corners of their hair polled, that dwell in the wilderness' (cf. also Lev. xix. 27). The custom was forbidden to the Jews because the heathen dedicated their hair to their gods (Robertson Smith, ib. p. 325). Translate 'they cut it in a ring (peritro/xala used adverbially), shaving round under the temples'. It was in cutting the hair on the temples that the Arabs were different from the Greeks. Orotalt is explained (Movers, Ph\u00f6n. i. 337) as 'ignis dei', i. e. the sun or the star Saturn; Alilat (i. e. Al-Ilat, 'the goddess') is at once the moon and the evening star. The pair correspond to the Baal and Ashtoreth of the North Semites; they are at once heavenly deities, and the powers of destruction and reproduction. Robertson Smith, however (Kinship in Arab. p. 298 seq.), says that they are the great nature goddess and her son (and husband) Dusares. H. (i. 131. 3 n.) gives a list of the various names of the goddess, to which we may add 'Argimpasa' (4. 59). For other unconvincing explanations of 'Orotalt' cf. Gruppe, Myth. Liter. (1908), p. 579. There is no 'great river' running into the *)eruqrh\\ qa/lassa (here = 'Red Sea'; but cf. i. 1 n.). The conduit of skins, however, seems to be a distorted version of a real fact. Chesney (Euphrates Exped. ii. 657) says it 'represents the primitive Kan\u00e1t', i. e. subterranean water-course, common in Western Asia; Elphinstone (i. 398) says he has heard of them thirty-six miles long. For these (between Media and Parthia) cf. Polyb. x. 28 and (in the desert of Kerman) M. Polo i. c. 20 (i. 124). The 'Psammenitus' of H. and the 'Psammicherites' (or Psammecheres) of Manetho (F. H. G. ii. 594) are both transliterations of the Egyptian name 'Psamtik'. The Greeks varied as much in their rendering of Oriental names as English scholars do in dealing with Indian ones. Ctesias (9, p. 66) calls him Amyrtaeus, confusing him with the fifth-century rebel (15. 3 n.); in his story, Combaphes, a eunuch, plays the part of Phanes and 'betrays the bridges'. The length of the reign of Amasis is correctly given; for H.'s accuracy in Saite chronology cf. App. X ad fin. Maspero (iii. 660) quotes the Egyptian story that the French invasion of 1797 was foretold by rain at Luxor; he adds that he never heard of rain at Luxor during six winters there. Rain, however, is now more frequent in Upper Egypt; cf. Budge, S\u00fbdan, i. 71, where he gives a gruesome story of the effects of a storm in 1887. At Thebes it rains a little three or four times a year. e)mpio/ntes de\\ tou= ai(/matos. For the blood pledge among the Scyths cf. iv. 70. Stein conjectures that this 'brotherhood of the sword' was connected with the worship of the Carian Zeus *stra/tios. For a similar ghastly pledge among desperate men cf. Sall. Cat. 22.

Wilkinson (ii. 74) says that both the monuments and modern experience confirm H.'s statement as to the hardness of Egyptian skulls. For the whole passage cf.

They are to be distinguished from the seven 'princes of Persia' (cf. iii. 70 n.), though the number (like 'twelve' in the various juries of mediaeval England) constantly recurs, e. g. Cyrus (Xen. Anab. i. 6. 4) summons a court of the seven noblest Persians to try the traitor Orontas. As the Mytilenaean trireme had a crew of 200 (cf. vii. 184. 1) the number of Egyptians executed was 2,000 (200 x 10). e)pi\\ gh/raos ou)dw=| is probably an intentional echo of the words of Priam (Il. xxii. 60). The custom seems to have been usual in the East; so Pharaoh Necho appointed Jehoiakim to be king over Judah (2 Kings xxiii. 34), and Nebuchadnezzar, Zedekiah (ib. xxiv. 17). Inaros, the Libyan king (12.4 and Thuc. i. 104, 109-10), rebelled in 460 B. C.; his rebellion was the cause of the disastrous Athenian expedition (459-454). Ctesias (c. 36, p. 73) tells us that after his surrender his life was spared for five years; but he was then given up to the Persian queen-mother, Amytis, who impaled him in vengeance for his killing her son Achaemenes. The names of Thannyras and Pausiris have not been found on the monuments, but these seem to show some of the Egyptian royal family as governors. The general control, however, was given to Aryandes (iv. 166). Amyrtaeus was ruler of Lower Egypt, and took part in the revolt of Inaros; the last certain mention of him is in 449 B. C. (Thuc. i. 112), when he was still holding out in the Marshes (cf. ii. 140); he may be the 'king of Egypt' (Plut. Per. 37) who sent corn to Athens 445-444, but Philochorus (fr. 90; F. H. G. i. 399) says this came from Psammetichus, king of Libya, the son of Inaros. The old view, that he is the 'Amyrtaeus' of the twenty-eighth dynasty (405-400 B. C., Man. fr. 70; F. H. G. ii. 596) is impossible, not so much because of the length of reign (cf. ii. 140 for a curiously exact parallel), but because this second Amyrtaeus was succeeded by another native dynasty, not by a Persian nominee, as H. here states. ai(=ma tau/rou. This was the fabled cause of the death of Themistocles (cf. Arist. Eq. 83-4 and Plut. Them. 31); the blood was supposed to coagulate and choke the drinker (Arist. Hist. An. iii. 19). According to the inscription on a statue (the Naophorus) in the Vatican, set up by Uza-hor-ent-res, admiral of Amasis and Psammetichus III (R. P. x. 49; cf. Petrie, iii. 361-2), Cambyses at first paid respect to the goddess Neith, cleansed her temple, and restored her revenues, which had been alienated for the Greek mercenaries. This was a reversal of the policy of Amasis (ii. 154 n.), and along with the outrage on his mummy was an appeal to the party in Egypt which had hated him. It was also the usual Persian policy towards the religion of subject peoples. Cf. Cyrus in Babylon (C. C. 27 seq. in R. P.2 v. 167), and also his attitude towards the Jews (2 Chron. xxxvi. 23). This inscription, however, is not inconsistent, as some maintain, with H.'s story of the outrage on Apis (c. 29), which took place after the disastrous expedition against Ethiopia; it speaks of a period of 'great woe in all the land', and Uza-hor-ent-res himself left Egypt (perhaps fleeing from Cambyses), and was recalled by Darius (\u00a7 7). Moreover, panegyrics on a monarch's piety are apt to be misleading (cf. 'our most religious and gracious King, George IV', though the parallel is only a partial one). Maspero, therefore (iii. 668 seq.), accepts H.'s narrative as to Cambyses (as does also Meyer, i.1 508 doubtfully); but it is rejected by many as due to Egyptian hatred of their conqueror; Duncker (vi. 170) argues that Egypt would never have remained quiet, had its religion been outraged thus. (See further c. 29 nn. and App. V. 3.) tafh=s: cf. ii. 169 n.; the name of Amasis is found to have been erased in several monuments at Sais and elsewhere. For the impiety of polluting fire by burning a dead body cf. App. VIII. 4, and i. 86 n. (the story of Croesus); i. 131. 2 n. h(liki/hn, 'stature' (cf. Matt. vi. 27). The mummy of the queen of Amasis from Thebes is in the British Museum; the gilding on it shows it was not burned. Expeditions of Cambyses to south and west. It will be at once obvious how much less H. knows here of the country south of Egypt than he does in ii. 29 seq. For the explanation of this cf. Introd. p. 14. The 'long-lived Ethiopians', as described by H., are a mythical people (cf. c. 20). His account of them is partly based on Homer (Il. i. 423; Od. i. 23, toi\\ dixqa\\ Zeus (Il.) and Poseidon (Od.) go to feast), partly on travellers' tales (c. 18); its exaggeration is natural, as they live at the end of the world to the south-west (iii. 114); so they are 'the tallest and fairest of men' (cf. the beauty of Memnon and a)mu/mones, Il. i. 423; Od. xi. 522). The tradition of the Egyptian priests would agree with this; Napata was the seat of a strict theocracy; cf. Diod. iii. 5 for the priestly control of the Ethiopian kings. But the Ethiopians who 'border on Egypt' (iii. 97. 2 n.) were a real part of the Persian Empire, now probably conquered by Cambyses (cf. App. V. 4). For the 'table of the sun' cf. Pomp. Mela, iii. 87, who repeats H., and Paus. vi. 26. 2, who treats it as an impossible fable. It is probably a misunderstood myth; the Egyptians spoke of a 'meadow of offerings', to which the souls of the dead came to eat; this was easily turned into a fact, as food was actually left on the tombs (Maspero, iii. 667 n.). The informants of H. give this myth a Greek colouring by bringing in the sun, and he is the more ready to believe the tale because of the Homeric 'feasts' of the Ethiopians (v. s. Heeren (African Nations, i. 327 seq.) finds a foundation of fact for the story in the record of Cosmas (sixth century A. D.), who says the traders in the land of Sasu exposed joints of meat in dumb commerce for gold (cf. iv. 196 for similar methods). This explanation is interesting, but the evidence of Cosmas is too late and doubtful to be accepted. Vases, with animals (not men) feeding from an altar-like table, were found (1909) at Karan\u00f2g in Nubia, which may perhaps be explained by the 'table of the sun' (Woolley and MacIver, Karan\u00f2g, 1910, p. 56). The same explorers (ib. p. 55) confirm H.'s statement that Dionysus was worshipped at Meroe (ii. 29). proasti/w|, like the 'changing officials', is a Greek touch. *)ixquofa/gwn. The 'fish-eaters' are placed by Pausanias (i. 33. 4) on the south coasts of the Red Sea; cf. Diod. iii. 15-20 for a marvellous account of them. The Persian messengers went 'from Elephantine' to 'fetch' them, as the place whence the caravans started south-east from the Nile. ou)k e)/fasan poih/sein. Cf. viii. 22. 1 for a mother-city claiming of her colonies the piety here shown by the Phoenicians. Grote (iv. 142) supposes that Cyrus had received the submission of the Phoenicians (so Xen. Cyr. i. 1. 4); but H. (iii. 34. 4), probably rightly, makes the Persians say that Cambyses prosekth=sqai th\\n qa/lassan. This annexation explains in part (cf. App. V. 2) why Egypt was not conquered till the fifth year of Cambyses. It is noticeable that Tyre, which had resisted Assyria and Babylonia desperately, yielded without a struggle to the Persian power, probably because under it local autonomy and religious institutions (c. 16 n.) were respected. Cyprus revolted from Egypt (ii. 182. 2) to Persia. The gifts resemble those sent to noble Persians; cf. iii. 84 n. The a)la/bastron was a (F. H.

Speke (Discovery of Source of Nile, 1863, p. 511) found this in Unyoro on the Upper Nile, and perhaps the same short reckoning prevailed earlier on the Middle Nile. A similar 'lightness' is attributed to an Indian river, the Silas (Megasthenes, fr. 19; F. H. G. ii. 415). pe/dh|si xruse/h|si.

The 'offerings' to the dead are a touch of reality in the fancy picture; cf. Budge, The Mummy, p. 328. For the facts in this chapter cf. App. V. *)/oasin po/lin. H. here uses 'Oasis' as a proper name for the so-called 'Great Oasis', that of Khargeh, which lay on the parallel of Thebes, 'seven days' journey' away (the figure is fairly right). For the oases cf. iv. 181 nn. H., however, is hopelessly confused; the Oasis of Ammon, that of Siwah (cf. ii. 32; iv. 181. 2 nn.), was much further north, in the latitude of the Fay\u00fbm, from which it could be reached in fourteen days. It is most unlikely that the Persians attacked it from the 'Great Oasis'. Perhaps H. had heard of the small oasis, which lies near the 'Great Oasis', and confused it with that of Siwah. St. Martin, pp. 40-1. As to the nature of the 'Aeschrionian tribe' it is impossible to speak definitely. The Etym. Mag. (s. v.*)astupa/laia) speaks of two tribes, the Astypalaean and the Schesian, which may be parallel to the 'Aeschrionian'; certainly *ai)sxri/wn is found as a proper name at Samos. On the other hand, the four Ionic tribes (v. 66. 2 n.) were almost certainly found there; two of them occur at Perinthus, a colony of Samos (Busolt, i. 279 n.). It is very curious to find Greeks 400 miles from the sea, and Dahlmann thinks H. is misled by some similarity of sound: it is safer, however, to accept so definite a statement about emigrants from a city which H. knew well (cf. Introd. p. 3 and iii. 60 nn.). Strabo (791) compares oases to islands, and the familiar legend of the 'isles of the blest' might well occur to a Greek traveller. But Spiegelberg (Z. A. S. 42. 85-6) has shown that H.'s derivation is meant to translate an Egyptian word, though it is inaccurate, and that it was derived from a native. Maspero (M. et A. E. ii. 422) says the idea that the oases were homes of the dead is a very old Egyptian one. no/ton me/gan. The modern view is that the simoon is deadly because it dries up the wells, not because it buries with sand. Duncker (vi. 166), however, quotes an instance early in the last century of a caravan, 2,000 strong, perishing in a sand-storm. As the Ammonians are found among the subjects of Darius, probably the expedition succeeded (cf. App. V. 4). For the Apis cf. ii. 38 n. 'Which is not hereafter allowed (oi(/h; cf. i. 29. 2) to conceive again in its womb.' The mother-cow was kept in a stall near the Apis stall (Strabo 807). The Egyptians thought the Apis upon.' H.'s account of the Apis is confirmed by the statues (cf. Rawlinson for picture), although Aelian (H. A. xi. 10) says that the Egyptians called it 'insufficient', for there were really twenty-nine signs; cf. Plin. N. H. viii. 'eagle'), &c., did not really exist (cf. ei)kasme/non), and well compares the dragon, lyre, and bear seen by the astronomers among the stars. The MSS. reading tetra/gwnon is usually altered to ti tri/gwnon, to make H.'s account correspond with the rest of the authorities. In colour the Apis was 'black' (as H. says), not white with black spots as Plut. (I. et O. c. 43; Mor. 368), or polu/xrous (as Ael. u. s.). Plutarch (de Isid. 44) says Cambyses killed the Apis, and gave the carcase to his dogs; H. as usual avoids these later exaggerations. But many modern historians (e.g. Brugsch, ii. 299-300) reject the story altogether, because an Apis sth/lh (No. 354 in the Louvre) represents Cambyses as adoring the bull-god; this belongs to the sixth year of his reign. Maspero (iii. 668 n.), however, accepts H.'s story. Wiedemann (Gesch. Aeg., 1880, p. 229) argues that the faulty execution of the Apis monument just mentioned shows it was executed secretly by the priests; moreover, its evidence is contradicted by another Louvre 'column', set up under Darius to commemorate an Apis born in the fifth year of Cambyses; he (p. 230) conjectures that this second monument was deliberately antedated, so as to ignore the cruel death of the last Apis; this hypothesis is probable, because it explains how two sacred bulls could be represented as existing at once, a thing in itself impossible. e)ma/nh. H. records, without accepting, the supernatural explanation of madness; he gives a natural one, c. 33. As to Cleomenes' madness, he, among various explanations (vi. 75 seq.), inclines to the supernatural (c. 84). *sme/rdin. His real name was Bardiya; Aesch. (Pers. 774) calls him Mardos. For the change from Bardiya to Mardos cf. Megabates (Mega = the Persian Baga). The initial *s was added because the name was confused with the real Greek name *sme/rdis (for which cf. Arist. Pol. 1311 b 29), on the supposed analogy of smikro/s and mikro/s. Ctesias (8, p. 65), who calls him 'Tanyoxarces' (which seems to be a nickname, Maspero, iii. 655), makes him satrap of Bactria and some adjacent districts, but this statement is of little value. For a full analysis of the various versions of his story cf. Duncker, vi. 175 seq.; but his results are very doubtful. The B. I. (i. 10) puts the murder before the expedition to Egypt. It obviously was kept a secret, for otherwise a pretender would have had no opportunity (cf. Perkin Warbeck's personation of the young Duke of York); this secrecy explains the divergence of traditions. Ctesias (10, p. 67) makes the murderer personate Smerdis for five years, by arrangement of Cambyses, and then seize the throne on his death. This, however, is an impossible solution of what is the real difficulty, i.e. how did the heir apparent disappear unnoticed? o)/yin. For a similar dream-warning against a dangerous man cf. i. 209. th\\n a)delfeh/n. Cyrus and Cassandane (ii. 1) had three daughters, Atossa (v. i.), this nameless one, the 'Roxana' of Ctesias (c. 12, p. 67), and Artystone, the favourite wife of Darius (iii. 88; vii. 69). Incestuous marriage is praised in the Avesta, and was freely practised under the Sassanians; instances occur in other Persian kings, e.g. Artaxerxes II married two of his own daughters (Plut. Artax. c. 23). This 'Persarum impia religio' (Catullus, xc. 4), however, was mainly the practice of the Magi. For the royal judges cf. 14. 5 n. The immutability of Persian law (cf.

Duncker (vi. 185) sees in the story of this murder an invention of 'poetical justice', which punishes Prexaspes for killing the son of Cyrus, by slaying his own son. e)pi/skopa: a familiar figure. e)pi\\ kefalh/n, 'on their head'; i.e. head downwards (cf. e)pi\\ k. fe/resqai, c. 75. 3). Stein and Rawlinson, however, translate 'to the neck', and this is a more usual form of punishment in the East. For burying alive generally cf. vii. 114 n. *kroi=sos . . . e)/qee e)/cw. Cf. the similar escape of David, 1 Sam. xviii. 11, and for seizing occasion to punish old offences cf. 1 Kings ii. 32, 44. kataproi+/cesqai: a favourite word with H. (cf. iii. 156. 3; v. 105. 1; vii. 17. 2), always in future and with a participle to express . i(ro/n. For this temple cf. ii. 101. 2 n. For the *pata/i+koi and the *ka/beiroi cf. ii. 51 n. The name of the *pata/i+koi was perhaps connected with that of Ptah, but this is most uncertain (cf. Roscher, iii. 1676). They were fat dwarfs with gorgon like features; cf. Perrot and Chipiez, iii, fig. 21, p. 65. Aesch. in Ctes. 190 uses *pataiki/wn = a trickster. H. here confuses the image of Ptah (Hephaestus) with those of the Khnoumou, 'the sons of Ptah'; these were dwarfs, with bent legs, long arms, and a huge head. Ptah himself was represented as a mummy, with head and hands free. This chapter is most characteristic of H. and of the general Greek attitude to religion; cf. Xen. Mem. iv. 3. 16, the well-known answer of Delphi, given repeatedly, that the gods were pleased with worship no/mw| po/lews. Strabo (805) says that he saw traces of the outrages of Cambyses on the temples of Heliopolis. The mad king was even credited with the destruction of the statue of Memnon, though this was really ruined by an earthquake in the time of Augustus. Cambyses, to Egyptian imagination, played the part that Cromwell is credited with in English cathedrals. Zeno later declined to condemn nations that ate their dead; burial, he held, was a matter not of principle but of convenience. The point illustrates well the cosmopolitanism of the Stoics. *kallati/as. For a discussion of this cannibalism and for modern instances cf. iv. 26 n. The name Callatiae (from Sans K\u00e2la = black) points to the aboriginal inhabitants of India; they are otherwise unknown except for a vague reference in Hecataeus (fr. 177, F. H. G. i. 12); perhaps they are the same as the *padai=oi of c. 99. The passage from Pindar (fr. 169), which H. here quotes, is preserved in Plato, Gorg. 484 B, where it refers to a 'natural law' that 'the stronger should rule quoting from memory, gives the passage a more general sense. Myres, A. and C. p. 157, says that no/mos is 'the formal expression of what actually happens . . .', 'it answers to our law of nature . . . a more or less accurate formulation of the actual course of events.' The story of Polycrates. H. explains its disproportionate length in c. 60; the story bears throughout marks of his personal observation, e.g. cc. 39. 4, 54, 60 (cf. for H.'s knowledge of Samos elsewhere, 146. 2, and for the Heraeum, Introd. \u00a7 25, p. 30). The connexion of events in Samos, however, with the course of Persian history was closer than H. suspected; Amasis had endeavoured to protect Egypt, in accordance with the usual policy of the Saite dynasty, by forming a league of maritime states; but the desertion of Cyprus and the submission of Phoenicia to the Persians (19. 3 n.) changed the balance of power, and Polycrates went over to the side of the stronger. H. ignores the real reasons of the policy of Polycrates, and gives us instead a story illustrating the Nemesis attendant on good fortune (cc. 40-3), which hides the treachery of Samos. But even in H. (c. 44) it is made clear that Polycrates was really the aggressor against Egypt. The date of Polycrates' accession is about 532 B.C. as given by Eusebius (cf. Busolt, ii. 508); we know that (a) he died before Cambyses (cc. 125-6), i.e. before 521 (cf. c. 66 n.); (b) Thucydides (i. 13) speaks of him as turannw=n e)pi\\ *kambu/sou, which renders impossible the statement that he 'flourished' not later than 550 B. C. (Diog. Laert. ii. 1); (c) Eusebius (Arm. Vers.) gives the sixteen years of Samian 'rule of the sea' as from 531 to 515, i.e. to the fall of Maeandrius (cf. Myres, J. H. S. xxvi. 91, 101, for slightly different figures). Alexis of Samos (fr. 2; F. H. G. iv. 299) says that Polycrates had gained his influence by lavish liberality. Polyaenus (i. 23) describes how he seized the city during a festival (cf. Cylon at Athens, Thuc. i. 126) and was victorious by the aid of Lygdamis (cf. 120. 3 for a curious detail as to his conspiracy). His friendship with Lygdamis (cf. i. 61) and his enmity to Lesbos (cf. 39. 4 with v. 94) are the proofs given for his supposed friendship with Pisistratus. e)panasta/s might imply a revolution against any form of government; but it is probable that an oligarchy was ruling in Samos, having been restored after the overthrow described in Plut. Quaes. Graec. 57; Mor. 303 seq. For Syloson's story cf. iii. 139 seq.; his son bore the family name Aeaces (iv. 138). For the use of penteconters, not triremes, cf. i. 163. 2 n. toco/tas. These 'bowmen' were 'native Samians' (45. 3). nh/swn. Cf. Thuc. i. 13. 6 for the conquest of the islands by Polycrates, and iii. 104. 2 for the honour paid to Delos. The rivalry of Samos and Miletus was perpetual (cf. the events of 494, 440, 412-404 B. C.), and probably explains the variations in the general foreign policy of both states. The story of the ring of Polycrates is one of the best illustrations of the doctrine of Nemesis (cf. fqonero/ninf. and in i. 32. 1 n.). Diodorus (i. 95) rationalizes the story by making Amasis break off the alliance because he (Polycrates) dislikes tyranny. Reinach (R.A. 1905, vi. 9) thinks H.'s story is a development of the yearly custom of throwing a ring into the sea as a claim of lordship (cf. the 'Marriage of the Adriatic' at Venice, Byron, C. H. iv. 91); he quotes i. 165, vii. 35, but these are irrelevant. Cf. Cook, C. R. xvii. 409 for a similar wild suggestion. e)nalla\\c For the to avert great calamities by small ones cf. Liv. v. 21. 15, the prayer of Polycrates, he did not escape subsequent disaster. a)ke/o. The present implies that the 'remedy' was to be repeated, 'if good luck hereafter did not befall him in due alternation with misfortunes'. sfrhgi/s. The stone in the ring was engraved, as Theodorus (i. 51. 3 n.) was a gem-cutter as well as a metal-worker; Paus. viii. 14.8 (cf. Frazer, iv. 237) implies that it was an emerald; hence Pliny (N. H. xxxvii. 4) is repeating a guide-book legend when he says that the ring was given by Augustus to the temple of Concord, and that the stone was a sardonyx. As Theodorus had been dead for half a century, the ring was to Polycrates an irreplaceable heirloom. Cf. Juv. iv. 45 seq. (the fisherman's gift to Domitian) for a grandiose parody of Herodotean simplicity. Mahaffy (Soc. Life, p. 169) quotes the invitation to the fisherman as illustrating the simplicity of Greek court life; but the whole story is a folk tale (cf. Frazer, u. s.), and the details can hardly be pressed. tou\\s u(pw/pteue ma/lista. For the employment of dangerous citizens on foreign service cf. Miltiades in the Chersonese (vi. 35. 3, though H. there gives a religious motive) and vii. 222 n. So Napoleon used Spaniards in the north of Europe (Oman, Penin. War, i. 367 seq.), who would have been dangerous at home. trih/resi. The mention of 'triremes' seems inconsistent with 39. 3, and is tacitly corrected by Thuc. i. 14fai/netai . . . tau=ta (i.

'At Carpathus', i. e. they had put in at this island, which lies between Rhodes and Crete, at the south-east exit from the Aegean. tou\\s a)p' *ai)gu/ptou. The variety of traditions is remarkable; probably the story of the victory of the aristocrats is due to Samian vanity. u(poprh=sai. For the tyrant holding the families of his subjects as hostages cf. Shakespeare, Richard III, v. iii. 61. oi( a)/rxontes, 'authorities' (cf. vi. 106 n.); i.e. the kings and senate as well as the ephors who, even in the sixth century, were beginning to usurp the control of foreign affairs (cf. ix. 7 for the first definite instance, in 479 B.C.). For the Spartan government and policy at this period cf. App. XVII. e)pilelhqe/nai. For this 'laconic repartee' in the original Doric cf. Plut. Moral. 232 D; on p. 223 he gives it to Cleomenes. qula/kw| perierga/sqai: translate 'they had used \"sack\" needlessly', lit. 'they had been superfluous with the \"sack\"'. The rude brevity of the retort is characteristic. Others (e.g. Grote, iv. 169) translate 'your wallet is superfluous', i.e. the words alone were enough. (Cf. Theophrastus, Char. 13 for periergi/a.) The story is told by Sextus Empiricus (in Mathem. ii. 23) of the Chians, seeking leave to import corn from Laconia. Some think this the original occasion, and find here an instance of the composite nature of H.'s history (cf. c. 80 nn.); but the Chian story is probably an invention based on H.'s narrative, and it is difficult to think that Chios needed to import corn, or that Laconia could export it, before 500 B. C. The version of H. is therefore preferable. This passage is interesting as the only definite reference in H. to the Messenian wars (cf. v. 49. 8). It supports the later tradition that the second Messenian war had an international character, Argos, Arcadia, and Pisa being allies of Messenia (Strabo 362), and Sicyon (Paus.iv.15) of the Lacedaemonians. Thucydides (i. 15) is thought to deny this by implication when he war. Busolt (i. 606 n.; cf. also p. 580 n.) therefore sees in the introduction of Corinth and Sicyon a reflection of the political grouping of the fifth century (e. g. at Mantinea 418 B. C.). But Samos would be exceedingly likely to assist the Lacedaemonians, as allies of Corinth, and Thucydides systematically depreciates the importance of Greek history before his own century. krhth=ros. For a description of the bowl cf. i. 70. 1. The story well illustrates H.'s tendency to confuse occasions with real causes. There is no reason to doubt that the theft of the bowl (which H. must have seen at the Heraeum) was a provocation to the Lacedaemonians; but for the attack on Polycrates the Lacedaemonians had motives of general policy: for these and for their attitude to tyranny cf. App. XVI. 10. 'Plutarch' (de Hdt. Mal. 21) for once makes a point iii. 43 and App. u. s. for a criticism of Plutarch's list of tyrants expelled by the Lacedaemonians). a(rpedo/nh e(ka/sth. Pliny (xix. 12) says the 'distinctness' of the 'threads' in the qw/rhc was so often tested by sightseers that 'parvas iam reliquias superesse hac linen with broidered work from Egypt.' Amasis was trying no doubt to induce the Lacedaemonians (au)toi=si) to join an anti-Persian league (cf. i. 46 n.). For the dedication at Lindus cf. ii. 182. 1. The chronology is inextricably confused (cf. App. XIV. 6). The 'insult' was about 550 B. C., and yet it is in the time of Periander, who died circ. 585. 'Plutarch' (u. s. c. 22) puts the events 'three generations' before Polycrates, and tells us from independent sources (Dionysius of Chalcis, fl. c. 350; fr. 3, F. H. G. iv. 396) that it was Cnidians (not Samians) who restored the boys to Corcyra; he confirms this by an appeal to honours granted by Corcyra to Cnidus. H. may have been misled by his Samian informants. The tyrant's brutality, however, may be accepted as a fact, characteristic of the Oriental leanings of the Cypselidae. (Cf. App. XVI. 4.) siti/wn . starving i. 134. 2; for the Samian evasion of their obligations to the Corinthians, under colour of a religious festival cf. Judges xxi. 19, the Gibeonites at Shiloh. dia/foroi. For the standing feud between Corinth and Corcyra cf. Thuc. i. 13. 4, 38. For H.'s account of the Cypselidae cf. v. 92 nn. and App. XVI. 3-4. The historical facts in these chapters are\u2014(1) that Periander killed his wife; (2) conquered his father-in-law Procles (52. 7); this conquest is important as probably being the occasion of the independence of Aegina (v. 83. 1); (3) reduced Corcyra to subjection; (4) (probably) that Lycophron ruled for a time in Corcyra; (5) that Periander left no son to succeed him; his successor was Psammetichus, son of his brother Gorgus (Arist. Pol. 1315 b 26). The rest of the narrative is romantic embroidery, moral tales such as the Greeks loved, which may be called 'the beginnings of the novel' (cf. Nitzsch, Rhein. Mus. 1872, p. 228). The style, especially in cc. 52 and 53, is characteristic of the age of the 'Seven Wise Men' (cf. i. 27 n.), among whom Periander was reckoned; the proverbs 'Obstinacy (h( filotimi/h) is an evil thing', 'Do not heal evil with evil' (53. 4, v. i.), &c., are not adornments, they are the real base of the story. For horrible details as to Melissa cf. v. 92 h. Periander had killed her in a fit of jealousy; this is darkly hinted at (52. 4). For the kh/rugma cf. Soph. O.

The town on the south slopes of 'the hill' Ampelus, which is some 700 feet high (H. says 900, c. 60. 1), and which stretched away to the west above the plain; at the south-west extremity lay the Heraeum. The Lacedaemonians attacked both by sea, i. e. on the south, and by land (kata\\ to\\n e)pa/nw pu/rgon), on the north or north-west. H.'s familiarity with Samos is noticeable (cf. c. 39). e)pech=lqon. This sortie may have been made to protect the Samian water supply (cf. 60. 1 n.). *)arxi/h|. H.'s mention of his informant here (cf. Introd. \u00a7 23, p. 28) throws light on the character of his evidence; his account of the siege is based partly on local Samian tradition, partly on the family tradition of Archias. Pitane was the aristocratic kw/mh (= the Attic dh=mos) at Sparta; the others (Paus. iii. 16. 9) were Mesoa, Cynosura, Limnae (cf. Thuc. i. 10. 2 for the survival of the kw=mai). For the lo/xos *pitanh/ths cf. ix. 53. 2 n. e)ti/ma. Archias was e)qelopro/cenos (Thuc. iii. 70) of Samos at Sparta. The significance and the recurrence of the names are to be noted. 'Plutarch' de Mal. Hdt. c. 22 says that Archias had a tomb dhmosi/a| kateskeuasme/non: this no doubt was set up after the fall of Polycrates by the Samian aristocrats. o(/rmhtai, 'has 161. e)s th\\n *)asi/hn: gives one reason why H. lays so much stress on 'this first expedition'; it was part of the long struggle between Europe and Asia. The 'second' is that of 479 B. C. (ix. 96 seq.). The addition of 'Dorians' is emphatic; the Achaean Lacedaemonians had taken part in the Trojan war. kataxrusw/santa: cf. for 'gilded' ki/bdhloi stath=res C. I. G. i. 150, p. 237. Siphnos, one of the Western Cyclades, was assessed at nine talents' tribute in 425 B. C., a large amount in proportion to its size; it had previously paid three talents (Hicks, nos. 48 and 64). It was the only island that was allowed a mint in the Confederacy of Delos (Holm, ii. 228), and this privilege was withdrawn during the Peloponnesian war (Hill, Sources2, p. 425). For the mines of Siphnos cf. Paus. x. 11. 2, who tells that they were submerged because the Siphnians failed to pay their tithe to Apollo, and Bent, J. H. S. vi. 195-8. The treasury at Delphi (cf. Paus. x. 11. 2) was discovered by the French explorers in 1893, and the remains fully confirm H.: 'the building is more lavishly decorated than any other found at Delphi' (Frazer, Paus. v. 272 seq.). Homolle, the French discoverer (ib. 629), now assigns the treasury to the Cnidians, not to the Siphnians (but see Dyer in J. H. S. xxv. 314-15). The style of sculpture exactly agrees with H.'s dating. diene/monto. For division of mine profits in the ancient state cf. vii. 144 n. That increased display of wealth was likely to tempt raiders and called for special 'precautions' (fra/ssasqai), was an obvious prophecy. *pari/w|: the earliest known instance of the use of Parian marble. Cf. v. 62. 3. In Homer miltopa/rh|os and foinikopa/rh|os only occur twice each; the ships are usually black, cf. Torr, A. S. p. 37; the 'red' colouring came in with the development of the Euxine trade; cf. mi/ltos *sinwpikh/. With the purchase of Hydrea cf. the attempt of the Phocaeans (i. 165. 1) to purchase the Oenyssian Islands. Hydrea lies to the south of the Argolic peninsula, while Cydonia is on the north-west of Crete; both acts were probably part of a movement to isolate Aegina and to extend the relations of the Corintho-Samian alliance (v. i.). For a similar attempt at Cyrene cf. iv. 163 n. The Aeginetans resented this trespass on their preserves (for their friendly relations to Crete cf. the proverb *krh\\s pro\\s *ai)ghnh/thn); hence they 'joined the Cretans' to expel the intruders, and secured their hold of Crete by a colony at Cydonia (Strabo 376). This connexion explains the hostility of the town to Athens (Thuc. ii. 85. 5). kai\\ to\\n . . . nho/n. The words are probably a mistaken addition, as Dictyna was a native goddess. kapri/ous. The Samian vessels were called u(o/prw|roi (Plut. Per. c. 26), and were supposed to resemble pigs from their heavy build. to\\ i(ro/n. For this temple, whence the famous Aeginetan marbles came to Munich in 1812, cf. Frazer, Paus. iii. 268 seq. It was first assigned to Zeus Panhellenius, then to Athena; but A. Furtw\u00e4ngler (cf. his splendid book on Aegina, Munich, 1906), who excavated it in 1901, has proved by inscriptions found in situ that it was dedicated to Aphaea. This goddess (Paus. ii. 30. 3) was also connected with Crete, and hence the dedication here for a Cretan victory is most appropriate to her. Furtw\u00e4ngler would read *)afai/hs (for *)aqhnai/hs here; he points out that Pausanias knows nothing of an 'Athena' temple in Aegina, although he quotes another passage of H. (v. 82 seq.) in the very next section (ii. 30. 4). Amphicrates seems to have been of the family of Procles, who led to Samos the Ionians expelled from Epidaurus by the Dorians (Paus. vii. 4. 2). For the overthrow of the monarchy at Samos cf. Plut. Qu. Gr. 57, where he speaks of the subsequent hostility between Samos and Megara, a member of the Aeginetan commercial league. Our scanty references to these early wars in the Aegean all tend to establish the theory of the rivalry of two great trade-leagues; Miletus, Aegina, Megara, and Eretria, trading mainly with the north-east, are ranged against Corinth, Samos, and Chalcis, whose main sphere is the west (cf. v. 99. 1 n.). *)emh/kuna. H., apart from his interest in Samos (cf. Introd. p. 3), made it his object to describe great works everywhere (cf. i. 93. 1). For Samos generally cf. V. Gu\u00e9rin, Patmos et Samos, 1856. o)/rugma. The object of the 'tunnel' was to bring the water from the other (i. e. the north) side of Mount Ampelus; the 'channel' in it (a)/llo o)/rugma) is not quite 'thirty feet' deep at the outlet, and decreases in depth as it approaches the spring from which it issues; this was to give sufficient fall for the water, but H. had of course only seen the outlet on the south side; as the boring was begun on both sides, the engineering skill required was very considerable. The work is a good instance of the way in which the tyrants 'courted popularity by providing for the needs of their people', and may be compared with the contemporary aqueduct of Pisistratus (cf. E. Gardner, Athens, pp. 26-7). The tunnel was discovered in Deutsch. Archaeol. Instit. 1884 (Athen.), pp. Tozer's Islands of Aegean, pp. 167 seq.). On the whole the accuracy of H. is strikingly confirmed, though he exaggerates the length of the tunnel, which is really about 1,100 feet. swlh/nwn. Remains of the 'pipes' have been found, both leading from the spring to the hill, a distance of some half mile, and in the tunnel itself through the hill. xw=ma. The mole extended from the western horn of the Old Harbour and more than half closed it. Its remains can still be seen about six feet below the surface. H. is right as to its length, but the sea at present is only ten fathoms deep (Gu\u00e9rin, pp. 203-4). nho\\s me/gistos. H. means of Greek temples: those of Egypt were larger. The Heraeum was 346 feet long and 189 broad (Leake, Asia Minor, p. 348, makes it 350, but other estimates are given; Gu\u00e9rin, p. 225), which is larger than any known Greek temple in the East, except that of Ephesus, which was finished later; H. (ii. 148) mentions these two temples as 'notable' Greek works. The temples at Acragas and Selinus are about the same size; the Olympieium at Athens was on a larger scale, but remained unfinished till the time of Hadrian. Pausanias (vii. 5. 4) says the Heraeum was 'burned puro\\s lelumasme/non. For Rhoecus cf. Murray, S. i. 74 seq.; he was connected with Theodoros (i. 51. 3 n.). His name has been found on a sixth-century vase at Naucratis. He probably began the temple half a century before, and it was finished under Polycrates. For these e)/rga *polukra/teia cf. Arist. Pol. 1313 b 24 who says were intended to produce a)sxoli/a kai\\ peni/a tw=n a)rxome/nwn; he does not mention the desire to provide wages for the poorer classes, though no doubt this motive was present with ancient (cf. Pl. Per. 12) as well as with modern despots. Aristotle compares them with the Pyramids and with the buildings of the Cypselidae and the Pisistratidae. The building policy of tyrants from the days of Cypselus to Napoleon III's 'Haussmannization' of Paris is a commonplace of history. The Samian Alexis says (F. H. G. iv. 299) that Polycrates also developed the agricultural wealth of his island. For his commercial and industrial activity cf. Ure in J. H. S. xxvi. pp. 132-3. The death of Cambyses, the rising of the Pseudo-Smerdis, and the accession of Darius. For the real history of these events cf. App. V. The B. I. mentions only one pretender, 'Gaumata,' and of course says nothing of his resemblance to Smerdis; on this point, which is probable in itself, H. is supported by Ctesias and Justin (i. 9); it is not inconsistent with the caution spoken of in 63. 2, 68. 2. The B. I. (i. 11) confirms H. as to the usurpation being unopposed. Justin has the name 'Cometes' right, but gives it to the chief plotter, not the actual pretender, whom he calls Oropastes. H.'s 'Smerdis' is required to explain the prophetic dream, cf. 30. 2, 64. 1. 'Patizeithes' is probably a title = 'Padishah'. No Ecbatana is known in Syria, and the attempts to explain the name (see Rawlinson ad loc.) are unconvincing. The religious coincidence is more than suspicious. The curved scimitar (a)kina/khs) needed a 'cap' (mu/khs) to guard its point; the same accident happened to Perseus with less fatal results; hence the name *mukh=nai (Paus. ii. 16. 3). The coincidence (as to the position of the wound) is also suspicious; cf. the legend that Salome, who danced off the head of St. John, was herself beheaded by floating ice. The B. I. (i. 11) says: 'Afterwards Cambyses, killing himself, died,' which seems to imply suicide. xrhsth/rion. It is odd that Cambyses should pay attention to an Egyptian oracle; but the whole story of 'the fiends which palter with us in a double sense', is clearly invented, cf. Shakespeare, 2 Henry IV, IV. 5 (ad fin.) (following Holinshed):\u2014 It hath been prophesied to me many yearsI should not die but in Jerusalem,Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land.But bear me to that chamber, there I'll lie;In that Jerusalem shall Harry die. A similar story is told of Julian the Apostate. a)/ra is emphatic, 'as is now proved'; cf. me/llon . . . a)potre/pein. The fatalism has a true Oriental ring, as well as being characteristic of H.; cf. i. 91; iii. 40 seq. timwre/ein: the parallel to 32. 2 upsets Meyer's theory (see App. V. 2) that cc. 32 and 65 come from 'different sources'. basilhi/ous. Histiaeus (v. 106) swears to Darius by these. So Darius in the Persepolis inscription invokes Ormazd and 'the gods of his race'. For the theory that the conspiracy was Median cf. App. V. 6. For the threefold curse of unfruitfulness cf. vi. 139. 2 n.; Soph. O. T. 25-7, 269; and Deut. (fr. 68), Ctesias eighteen (xii, p. 67). A Babylonian contract has been found (T.S.B.A. vi. 484) dating from the eleventh year of his reign, which shows that Cambyses was associated with Cyrus as king of Babylon (cf. C. C. i. 35; R. P.2 v. 168, and Meyer, Forsch. ii. 471). So far as the length of his sole rule is concerned H. is right, and is confirmed by the Apis Stelai (Wiedemann, Gesch. Aegyp. 1880, pp. 219-20), and by the Canon of Ptolemy, which gives Cambyses eight years (including, of course, the seven months of the usurper, 67. 2). B. I. i. 13 confirms H. that the conspiracy succeeded for a time. It says nothing of the popular acts of the Pseudo-Smerdis, but they are probable in themselves; cf. the constitutional character of the reign of Richard III for similar conduct in a usurper. *farna/spew . . . pai=s. For the position of Otanes see c. 84. He was the son of Socris (not of Pharnaspes, B. I. iv. 18). H.'s mistake may perhaps be due to a confused tradition as to his ancestor (abavus) Pharnaces, who married Atossa, the aunt of grandfather of Cyrus 'the great' (Diod. xxxi. 19). Meyer (iii. 18), however, rejects this whole pedigree as a late fiction. From him descended the royal house of Cappadocia; Diodorus and Ctesias (14, p. 67) substitute for 'Otanes' his son Anaphas or Onophas (H. vii. 62). H. wrongly lays the scene at Susa (cf. 70. 3), because it was to him, as to all Greeks and Jews (cf. Neh. i. 1), the capital of the empire (v. 49 n.); the B. I. (i. 13) puts the final struggle at Sictachotes (Sikayauvatish), a Median fort. The 'Acropolis' is the basilh/ion tei=xos of 74. 3. *kambu/sew gunaici/. This was usual in the East; cf. c. 88. 2 and Absalom's conduct 2 Sam. xvi. 21. die/speire. In view of these precautions, the ease with which Phaedymia communicated with her father is strange; H. is telling merely the popular tale. ta\\ w)=ta a)pe/tame. For such mutilations cf iii. 118, 154, and ix. 112, and the rigorous justice of the younger Cyrus (Xen. Anab. i. 9. 13; also B. I. ii. 13); no mutilated person could ever reign. Perhaps the story is based on a play of words, the Persian word for Magian being interpreted 'a man having no ears' (J. R. A. S., 1890, p. 822). Cf. Esther ii. 12 for the harem arrangements. The names of Darius' confederates are given as follows: HerodotusDarius (B. I. iv. 68)Ctesias (14, p. 67)OtanesIntaphrenes the son of VeisparesOnophas.AspathinesOtanes son of SocrisIdernes.GobryasGobryas son of MardoniusNorondabates.IntaphrenesHydarnes son of MegabignesMardonius.MegabyzusMegabyzus son of DadoesBarisses.HydarnesArdomanes son of BasucesAtaphernes. As to the list it should be noted (1) that H. gives all the names right except Aspathines, who seems to be Aspachana, the quiverbearer of Darius (cf. Nakhsh-I-Rustam Inscrip.); (2) that Ctesias has only one right, Hydarnes, and that in two cases (Onophas and Mardonius) he gives the names of their sons (cf. Gilmore, Ctes. p. 148 for an attempted explanation); (3) that the families of all the conspirators except Intaphrenes (for obvious reasons) are prominent in the later history. Some have maintained (e.g. Niebuhr) that H. is wrong in making the number seven an accident; the Seven were the heads of the great Persian families, who naturally took the lead in a 'national movement'. So later we have the 'seven counsellors' (Ezra vii. 14), and the seven princes of Persia who 'saw the king's face' (Esther i. 14). But the coincidence of the number 'seven' is probably an accident (cf. for other 'sevens' iii. 14 n. and Esther i. 10, the 'seven chamberlains'), for (1) It is hard to see how the number of the 'counsellors' could have been maintained when one of the conspirators (Darius) had been raised to the throne, and another (Intaphrenes, iii. 119) attainted. (2) Plutarch (Praec. Reip. Ger. c. 27, Mor. 820) says the conspirators' descendants had the right to wear the upright tiara, the royal badge; but he attributes this to their part in the conspiracy. (3) Darius in the B. I. seems to imply that the number was fortuitous. He adds 'a Persian' to the name of each conspirator; but this is to lay stress on the national character of the movement, not to show that the men were especially privileged. H. therefore is probably right on this point, though the 'seven counsellors' may well be a real institution, and though the descendants of the conspirators were rewarded with great privileges (84 n.). e)k *perse/wn. Here, and in i. 209, Hystaspes is starap of Persia; this may be a confused reference to the fact that he represented the younger Achaemenid line; he was really satrap of Parthia (B. I. ii. 16). This sophistry is an attempt at consistency with H.'s own statement (i. 138) that among the Persians 'to lie is held most disgraceful'; it is purely Greek (cf. discussion in Plat. Repub. ii and Xenop. Cyrop. i. 6. 27 seq.). H. here unites with his main story as to the discovery of the conspiracy, the story of Prexaspes. Ctesias (13, p. 67) briefly says that the murder of Smerdis was revealed to 'the army' by Izabates, who had been one of the three persons privy to it. The tale is, however, very improbable; the Magians were not likely to have put up Prexaspes to speak, for the strength of their position lay in its being unchallenged, and the act here described could only excite suspicion. ta\\ pa/nta muri/a: cf. iv. 88. 1 n. i)rh/kwn ktl. Cf. the omen in Tac. Ann. ii. 17. 2 (Germanicus to his 'irent, 205 seq., where Atossa is dismayed by the sight of an eagle attacked by a hawk. kataideo/menoi. Some see in this a reference to the special privilege of the 'seven Persian grandees' (c. 70 n.). But it seems less definite than the right claimed by Intaphrenes (c. 118; cf. c. 84). The rooms, opening on to the central court, would have no external windows. Darius affirms (in the B. I.) three times that he slew Gomates himself. Aeschylus (Pers. 776) assigns the deed to Artaphrenes, substituting the familiar name (v. 25 et pass.) for the unfamiliar Intaphrenes. magofo/nia. Rawlinson accepts H.'s story: 'the festival served as a perpetual warning to the priests against trenching on the civil power' (so in part, Darmesteter, S. B. E. IV, Intr. p. 50). Ctesias (15, p. 68) also mentions the commemorative festival. B\u00e4hr (ad loc. seems to suggest that the festival was one of purification, at which the Magi slew all the creatures of Ahriman, and that it had nothing to do with the conspiracy. This view is not probable. Stein makes qo/rubos subject of e)ge/neto, and translates 'when the confusion had died down, and when more than five days had since passed'; but it is easier to take e)ge/neto as impersonal. The sense is the same. Sextus Empiricus (in Math. ii. 33) says 'the Persian nobles have a custom, when their king is dead, to spend the five following days in lawlessness', in order to learn how evil a)nomi/a was. This custom, if a fact, may be referred to here; but Sextus Empiricus is probably giving a mere inference from H. The discussion of the conspirators which follows (cc. 80-2) is most important in three respects. A. Its bearing on the composition of H.'s work. (1) He refers to criticisms on it (VI. 43); hence it has been inferred that Book III was written and published before Book VI (cf. Introd. p. 13 n.). The more probable inference, however, is that H. went on adding to his work after parts of it had become known to the public. (2) It is quoted as proof of the theory that H.'s history is partly a compilation from the works of previous authors (cf. 46. 2). Maass (Hermes, xxii. 581 seq.) thinks that the arguments are borrowed from a sophistic dialogue, probably one of the 'negative arguments' (kataba/llontes lo/goi) of Protagoras, and that the same source was used by Isocrates (Nicocles, 14 seq.). The resemblances, however, between H. and Isocrates are merely accidental, and Meyer (F. i. 201-2) completely demolishes the theory; he sums up (cf. 81. 2 n.) 'Maass makes H. a simpleton if he imagines that he could impose on the public inventions of his good friend Protagoras as historical facts'. B. The historical reality of the facts. H. vouches for this in the strongest way, 'they were said, in spite of all objections' (d' w)=n). Probably H. is following the account of a Hellenized Persian (cf. J. H. S. xxvii. 40); the questions actually discussed were\u2014'Should the Persians revert to the natural condition of the old Iranian society, and let all clans live under their immemorial customs?' or 'should they continue the centralized monarchy?' i.e. the liberty claimed was simply the rights of the great nobles (cf. Mahaffy, G. L. ii. 32 n., and on the Oriental idea of 'Liberty', Beavan, House of Seleucus, i. 3 seq.). C. The passage is the beginning of Greek political philosophy. (Cf. Freeman's Sicily, iii. 644 seq., for the threefold division of constitutions and early references to it.) H. here, as always, clothes Persian ideas in the phrases of his own countrymen (cf. i. 96, the story of Deioces), as all men of genius do, e. g. Shakespeare's Venetians are Elizabethan Englishmen and Racine's Greeks are courtiers of Le Grand Monarque. It is against this arbitrary introduction of speeches that Thucydides (by implication) protests in i. 22. 1; his own speeches he claims were appropriate to what the occasion demanded. The essence of the Greek tyrant was that he was 'irresponsible'; it is curious that Arist. does not use the word a)nupeu/qunos of the tyrant, though he lays stress on the fact. u(/bri kekorhme/nos. On the close connexion of ko/ros and u(/bris cf. viii. 77 n. Darius (B. I. i. 13) lays stress on the cruelty of the Magian. a)ri/stoisi. For this feature in the tyrant cf. Plato, Rep. viii, p. 567; he must remove all who a)ndrei=oi, fro/nimoi, plou/sioi. Tyranny mali Tac. Ann. i. 80). Stein takes a)/ristoi, ka/kistoi in the political sense, 'bestborn,' &c., but this is less likely. For the difficulty of intercourse with a tyrant cf. the fable of the lion and his courtiers, and Tac. Ann. i. 12.2 contrasted with iii. 65. 3; Tiberius is equally offended by free speech and by servility. For the lawless lust of tyrants cf. the long list of brutalities in Arist. Pol. 1311. This line might be the text for the panegyric on democracy in the Funeral Speech (Thuc. ii. 37); 'equality of opportunity' is the boast of Pericles. For H.'s own praise of i)shgori/h cf. v. 78. The three marks of democracy are (1) election by lot (cf. Arist. Pol. 1294 b 7 and Headlam, 'Lot at Athens,' p. 11 seq., which discusses admirably the purpose of the lot); (2) responsibility of officers (Pol. ii. 12.4; 1274 a: Solon gave the Athenians a)nagkaiota/th du/namis, i. e. to elect their officers and to call them to account); (3) popular control of all measures. ou)/t' e)dida/xqh. The ordinary antithesis between learning from others and perceiving for oneself; cf. Thuc. lack of intelligence (a)cunetw/teron), and its consequent unprofitableness (a)xrh/iou); cf. Hes. passage is supposed by Maass (v.s.) to resemble Isocrates, Nic. 18, who meaning is quite different; H. refers to the blind impulses of a mob, Isocrates to merit lost in a crowd. a)ri/stou. Darius assumes the king will be 'the best' (such an one diafe/rwn kat' a)reth/n, Arist. Pol. iii. 13, p. 1284 b must rule); he takes no account of the pare/kbasis of monarchy, the bad rule. sta/sies: cf. Thuc. viii. 89. 3 for internal jealousies as the weakness of an oligarchy. The aorists a)pe/bh, die/dece are gnomic, i. e. the a)vefa/nhinf.). e)s ta\\ koina/: parallel to e)s to\\ koino/n style of the Sophists is very traceable here. pau/sh|. Cf. the hopes that Alcibiades in 408 B. C. would prove a 'saviour of society' at Athens (Diod. xiii. 68), and, on a larger scale, the acceptance of the Napoleonic rule as a salvation from 'the Red Terror'. So Deioces was made ruler by the Medes (i. 97), to save them from a)nomi/a. For the origin of tyranny generally cf. App. XVI. h( e)leuqeri/h. H. here leaves generalizations on Greek politics and inserts a Persian argument, an appeal to the services of Cyrus to his country; perhaps there is the beginning also of the idea which inspires the Cyropaedia of Xenophon\u2014that Cyrus is the ideal monarch. The special position of the house of Otanes seems to be a fact, but it was probably of earlier date; he may have been of Achaemenid blood (68. 1 n.); at any rate his daughter Phaedymia had married Cambyses; Xerxes married his grand-daughter, Amestris. With the gifts appointed for him (84. 1) cf. what is 'done to the man (Mordecai) whom the king delighteth to honour' (Esther vi. 8-9), though the Jewish writer has made the honours more distinctly royal. For less romantic parallels cf. vii. 88. 1 and 106. 1. The most honourable gifts were (Xen. An. i. 2. 27) a horse with a golden bridle, and a golden necklace, bracelet, and scimitar. Ctesias (Pers. p. 69) adds dikaio/tata, 'fairest,' i. e. to themselves; it is explained by the rest of the chapter. tw=n e(pta/. For the position of the 'Seven' in general cf. 70 n. The rule as to marriage seems to have been observed (88. 3; vii. 2. 2). They received also great grants of territory, probably free of tribute; from Hydarnes descended the rulers of Armenia (Strabo 531), from Otanes those of Cappadocia (68 n.). This is the origin of the strange tale in Plato (Leg. iii. 695 C) that Darius divided his kingdom in seven parts among the conspirators. e)bou/leusan. Darius succeeded in right of birth (cf. App. V. 7); but the colouring of the story is correct: the Persians, as sunworshippers, honoured sunrise (cf. vii. 54. 1), and the horse was sacred among them; cf. C. R. xxvi. 50. For auguries by horses cf. Tac. Germ.x. i(ppoko/mos. The story of the trick is given by both Justin (i. 10) and Ctesias (15, p. 68). The name Oebares occurs in Nic. Dam. fr. 66 (F. H. G. iii. 400) as that of the adviser of Cyrus in his conspiracy against Astyages; it is explained a)gaqa/ggelos. H. is combining a popular legend (for another fragment of it cf. 86. 2 and Nic. Dam. u. s. p. 405, the signs from heaven) with a misunderstood inscription on a monument of Darius (88. 3 signs, of the supreme god, Ormazd, 'confirmed' him as king; they 'happened as it were in agreement' with the horse-omen sent by the sun-god Mithra. Cf. Xen. Cyr. i. 6. 1 for similar signs to Cyrus, when beginning his attack on the Medes. *ku/rou te . . . *kambu/sew. Stein takes this to mean that there had been a general rising against Cambyses. (Xen. Cyr. viii. 8. 2 definitely states this.) If this be right it explains the postponement of his Egyptian expedition till his fifth year. But probably H. only refers to the reduction of Phoenicia and Cyprus (19. 3 n.). The 'Arabians' serve in the Persian army (vii. 69), where they are coupled with the Ethiopians of Africa, and are included in the official lists of provinces (cf. App. VII. 1) next to Egypt. Hence Rawlinson (on ii. 8) is probably right in putting these Arabians between the Nile and the Red Sea. H.'s statement here as to Arab independence (cf. iii. 7 seq.) refers to a different set of tribes, i. e. the nomads to the south and east of Palestine. The Persians, wiser than the Assyrians, did not attempt to conquer the wild tribes of the desert, but made friends with them. The Arabs had pressed north, as early as the fifth century, into the regions desolated by the Assyrian raids. (Meyer, iii. 86 seq.) They controlled the spice trade (c. 107); hence they give the Great King yearly 1,000 talents of frankincense. For Artystone cf. vii. 69. 2. i(ppeu/s. Neither at Behistun nor on his tomb at Nakhsh-IRustam is Darius represented on horseback. (For illustrations of these monuments cf. Maspero, iii. 681-3, 736-7.) But H. may well have seen some equestrian 'relief', now destroyed, resembling the fa\u00e7ade of Tagh-I-Bostan (Perrot, v. 534). This division of H.'s work describes the Persian empire as organized by Darius; it consists of two parts, very unequal in length and in authenticity; cc. 89-96 give an official statistical account of the Empire (cf. App. VII and vii. 61 n.); cc. 97-117 describe the more remote dependencies and are largely made up of travellers' tales. Holdich (Gates of India, 1909, p. 17) writes: 'twenty-five years ago our military information concerning ethnographical distributions in districts immediately beyond the north-west frontier was not better' (than that in H.), and 'the tribes have mostly survived to bear valuable testimony to the knowledge of the East in the days of H.' e)n *pe/rsh|si goes with poih/sas tau=ta; the contrast is between the acquisition of royal power and the organization of the empire. H. only here and in i. 192. 2 uses satraphi/h, in both cases with an explanation (a)rxh/); his usual word is nomo/s. Aeschylus uses no form of the word at all, and Thucydides only satrapei/a; Xenophon is the first to use satra/phs; the ruler in H. is u(/parxos (cf. vii. 194 n.). satra/phs, i.e. 'Kh\u00e1trap\u00e2van', is found twice in the B. I. and seems = 'upholder of the crown': it is found first in Sargon's list of Median chiefs, apparently as a proper name. The office existed before Darius; cf. B. I. u. s.; i. 153. 3 (Tabalus); iii. 120 (twice, Oroetes and Mitrobates); iii. 70. 3 (Hystaspes) and iv. 166 (Aryandes). The innovation of Darius (for its importance cf. App. VI. 4) consisted in his introducing a regular tribute for the whole empire; perhaps also he substituted government officials for native feudal princes (so Stein, who compares i. 134. 3, and says the Median system there described lasted to the time of Darius). The main, though not the entire, source of Persian revenue, was the land tax (vi. 42. 2). The sums given by H. are those due to the royal treasury, not the whole amount raised in the provinces. prosta/sswn. Rawlinson (and others) takes this as opposed to u(perbai/nwn, 'generally he joined, but sometimes he passed over the nearer tribes.' He (ii. 563) argues that this was done because the divisions were 'ethnical rather than geographical', an arrangement especially convenient among the nomadic tribes of the far East. But grammar (there is no me/n, de/) and political sense alike render this impossible; and as a fact H.'s list of tribes is geographically arranged, except perhaps for the Utii (93. 2 n.) and the sixteenth satrapy (93. 3 nn.). u(perbai/nwn tou\\s p. form. Translate 'he fixed the tributes to come in to him, nation by nation, while he joined their neighbours with each nation, and, as he got further from the centre (u(perbai/nwn t. p.), he distributed the more remote nations in various groups'. Thus each satrapy consisted of the e)/qnos whose name it bore (e.g. Ionia), and of the tribes grouped with it (e. g. with Ionia went Magnesia, Aeolis, &c., 90. 1). kata\\ ta/de would most naturally refer to iii. 90 seq.; the rest of this chapter would then be a later addition on the part of H. But as the text stands kata\\ ta/de must refer to the two coin standards which are here explained, a heavier (Babylonian) for silver coinage, a lighter (Euboic) for gold; these were in the proportion of four to three. H., however, substitutes the slightly heavier Attic talent for the Euboic; there were 33,660 grammes in the Babylonian talent, 26,400 in the Attic, i.e. (roughly) 60 Babylonian minae = 78 Attic, the proportion usually accepted; he confirms it by a second emendation in 95. 1 (q. v.). The MSS. here, however, have only e(bdomh/konta, and this reading is as old as Pollux (ix. 86). a)/lla. For Darius' first coining Darics cf. iv. 166. 2 n.; for their value cf. Head, H. N. p. 826. They were worth twenty silver si/gloi, about <02>12s., and were almost identical with the Croesus staters, but had three per cent. of alloy. xalepo/s. This epithet with h)/pios is an echo of Od. ii. 232-4. In vii. 77. 1 the *kabhle/es are identified with the Lasonians; H. reproduces two sources without troubling to reconcile them. For the *kaba/lioi cf. Ramsay, C. and B. pp. 265-6; they lay on the borders of Lycia and the Roman province of Asia; their important town, Cibyra, Strabo (631) says was founded by Lydians (hence they are called oi( *mhi/ones in vii. 77. 1). For the Milyans cf. i. 173. 2 n. The Hytennians were perhaps the only Pisidian highlanders subject to Persia; for the independence of these mountaineers cf. Xen. Anab. i. 1. 11; the *)etennei=s in the third century B. C. were able to raise 8,000 hoplites (Polyb. v. 73). Cf. v. 25 n. for the two first satrapies as always united under one ruler. The second satrapy was officially called Sparda (= Sardis) from the name of its capital; cf. c. 120. The Hellespontines are the Greeks of North-west Asia Minor. For the Thracians cf. vii. 75 n., where they are called 'Bithynians', and the story of their immigration is given; the Mariandynians were well known to the Greeks from their neighbourhood to the colony of Heraclea (Xen. Anab. vi. 2. 1). For the Syrians (= the Cappadocians) cf. i. 72 n. The name is one of several proofs that H. did not borrow this list from Hecataeus, as some have suggested: Hec. (fr. 194; F. H. G. i. 13) calls this people *leuko/suroi (contrast too his *ti/baroi (fr. 193) with *tibarhnoi/ in iii. 94). Darius gives the native name 'Katapatuka' in his list of conquests. The official name of the third satrapy was Dascylitis (Thuc. i. 129. 1). The third satrapy was hereditary in the house of Pharnaces, who was descended from one of the 'Seven' (cf. 84. n.). H. here uses Cilicia in the wide sense, as including not only (1) the strip of coast, but also (2) the Taurus region to the north as far as, and even beyond, the Halys (i. 72. 2), and (3) the country to the north-east (the later Commagene) as far as the Euphrates (v. 52. 3). Hence the tribute of this satrapy was a heavy one, 500 talents (v. 49. 6). As, however, 140 talents was spent in the province, it is only reckoned as 360 talents in the total (c. 95). Cilicia was held by native rulers who all bore the Semitic name *sue/nnesis (cf. i. 74. 3; v. 118. 2; vii. 98. 1); perhaps this was a title (cf. 'Pharaoh'). Their dependence on the central power varied according to its strength or weakness. The 'white horses' were sacred to the sun-god Mithra (for their sacrifice cf. vii. 113. 2 n.); hence one is paid for each of the 360 days in the year. They were also sacred to Ormazd (vii. 40). Strabo (525) says there was a similar tribute of horses, besides other cattle, from Cappadocia and from Media (1,500 and 'about 3,000' horses respectively). For the tribute in kind cf. i. 192 n. and App. VI. 8. Posideium lay south of the Orontes, on the slopes of the Syrian Mount Casius, which originally formed the southern boundary of Cilicia; in later times this lay further north, at the Syrian gates. Amphilochus was supposed to have led eastwards some of the Greeks from Troy; he settled them in Pamphylia (vii. 91, a passage which supplements this). For the independence of the Arabians cf. c. 8; they, however, brought annual gifts (97. 5). For *suri/h h( *palaisti/nh cf. 5. 1 n. The fifth satrapy was called by the Persians 'beyond the river' (Ezra v. 6; vi. 6); it, however, included, at any rate later, a district east of the Euphrates (Arr. Anab. iii. 8. 6). *ba/rkhs. For the conquest of Barca by Aryandes, the satrap of Egypt, cf. iv. 201; for Lake Moeris ii. 149 n.; the revenue from it was 240 talents a year. The whole passage (cf. App. IX. 1) implies that the Persians were masters of Egypt when it was written. For the 'White Fort' cf. 13. 2 and Thuc. i. 104. 2. e)pimetreome/nou: i.e. '120,000' (medimni) 'in addition to' (e)pi/) the tribute. e(/bdomos. H. so far has arranged his satrapies geographically; he continues to do so from the 8th to the 12th (or perhaps the 13th); but his 7th satrapy is in the extreme north-east of the empire, southeast of the Paraphamisus (hold. Hindoo-Koosh) Mountains. H. had little or no idea of the arrangement of the eastern half of the Persian empire. He joins the Gandarians and Dadicae in vii. 66, where he says they were equipped like the Bactrians. The Gandarii are called by Hecataeus (fr. 178; 12) an 'Indian tribe'; Strabo (697) puts Gandaritis in the valley of the Cabul; they and the Sattagydi ('Thatagush') come in the first list of provinces (B. I. i. 6), where they are followed by Arachosia. Hence Meyer, iii. p. 97, puts them down as conquests of Cyrus. It is possible that their earlier conquest may explain their curious place in the list, especially as none of them joined in the general revolt against Darius. The Aparyti are otherwise unknown, but Holdich (Gates of India, pp. 28, 31) puts all these tribes in the Indus valley, and identifies the Aparytae with the modern Afridi. *sou/swn. H. now starts from the head of the Persian Gulf, and gives the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th satrapies in order from south to north. The official name of the Cissian satrapy was Susiana; it kai\\ th=s loiph=s *)assuri/hs. H. here as always (cf. i. 178. 1 n. unites Babylonia and Assyria; they are distinguished in the inscriptions. Assyria was properly the district on the east (i.e. left) bank of the Tigris, which H. calls Matiene (v. 52). He seems to include all Mesopotamia (a name first found in Polyb. v. 44) in the Assyrian satrapy; probably this was the arrangement of Darius (cf. C. F. Lehmann, Woch. f\u00fcr Kl. Ph., 1900, p. 962, n. 6), which lasted till Xerxes, on his return from Greece (Arr. Anab. vii. 17. 2), punished Babylon for revolt (i. 183. 3 n.). Perhaps the huge size of the satrapy was a special honour to its first satrap, Zopyrus (160. 2). For its importance cf. i. 192; it fed the Great King and his army for two-thirds of the year. For the Paricanii, 94. 1 n., probably the *parhtakhnoi/ should be read here, whom H. calls a Median tribe (i. 101. 1). They lived (near the modern Ispahan) in the mountains separating Persia and Susiana from Media, and forming the watershed of the Choaspes (cf. Strabo 744 for their position and predatory character). The name of the *)orqokoruba/ntioi (otherwise unknown) is explained by some as 'dwellers in the mountain'. *ka/spioi ktl. These four tribes, none of which occur elsewhere, for the Caspii here are not the same as those of 93. 3, must have lived to the north-east of Media, on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. Perhaps they represent the satrapy of Hyrcania (cf. c. 117 and vii. 62. 2), the omission of which is a perplexing feature of this list. Hyrcania, however, does not occur in any of Darius' lists (cf. App. VII. 1), though it is mentioned in the B. I. (ii. 16) along with Parthia. It (Strabo 507 seq.) was more important in Parthian than in Persian times (cf. Tac. Ann. xv. 1). The Bactrii or Bactriani lived in the basin of the upper Oxus: their capital was the modern Balkh. The Aegli may be the *au)galoi/ of Ptolemy, vi. 12, a Sagartian tribe south of the Jaxartes. The huge 16th satrapy (93. 3) included the wilder nomad tribes, and surrounded the more settled Bactria on three sides, north, west, and south: their warriors (vii. 66. 1) were equipped like the Bactrians. H.'s 13th satrapy lies north-west of Media, while the 11th lies north-east of that country. Pactyice here adjoins Armenia and is obviously not the district of the same name which adjoined India (102. 1 q. v.). The 14th satrapy seems to have consisted of the whole of the western part of the Iranian plateau to the Persian Gulf, for it included 'the islands'. Hecataeus (frs. 170, *mu/kwn ei)s *)ara/chn potamo/n, apparently giving these as the northern and southern limits of Asia. All the names except the 'Thamanaeans' occur in Darius' inscriptions; these are joined again with the *sara/ggai in 117. 1. The Sagartians (Persian nomads in i. 125) and the Utians (cf. B. I. iii. 40, Yautiya, 'a district of Persia') seem to have been connected with the ruling race, but may have been made tributaries for not having assisted Cyrus in his attack on the Medes. The Sagartians are described (viii. 85) as horsemen armed with lassoes. The Sarangians are the *dra/ggoi of Arrian (Anab. iii. 21), and lived in the modern Seistan. The name of *mu/koi seems to survive in the modern Mekran, the southern province of Persia. Strabo (765) speaks of Macae on the coast of Arabia opposite. Some have seen in the *ou)/tioi the *ou)/cioi of Arrian, Anab. iii. 17. 1, who lived partly in the mountains south of Susa, and levied blackmail even on Persian kings; but they are geographically separated from the rest of the 14th satrapy by Persia proper, and it is more probable the Utii lived near the Persian Gulf. The islands are those in the mouth of the Persian Gulf (cf. vii. 80), off the now much-talked-of port of Bander Abbas. The practice of deportation was usual with the military monarchies of the old world, especially in the East (cf. 2 Kings xv. 29; xviii. 11, 32); for instances in H. cf. vi. 3 n. The 15th satrapy seems to lie in the extreme north-east beyond Bactria; the Amyrgian Sacians have the same commander as the Bactrians (vii. 64. 2 n). The Caspii (not the Caspii of 92. 2) are mentioned in vii. 67. 1 and 86. 1 among the Eastern tribes of the army; perhaps they are the inhabitants of Cashmere, but this is not probable, as in that case they would have the mountains between them and the Sacae. For the position of the 16th satrapy cf. 92. 2 n. All the tribes in it occur on the monuments of Darius. The Parthians, afterwards so famous, lived in the modern Khorasan, south-east of the Caspian. The Chorasmians lay north-east of them, on the lower Oxus (cf. Arr. Anab. iv. 15). The capital of Sogdiana, the tribe further to the north-east, was Samarcand; the name Soghd is still borne by the district between the Oxus and the Jaxartes (Wilson, Aria. p. 129). The Areii (in vii. 66 called *)/arioi\u2014not the same as the *)/arioi, the old name of the Medes, vii. 62. 1 n.) lived in West Afghanistan, where their name may survive in 'Herat'. Darius calls them 'Haraiva'. The 17th satrapy seems to correspond to Beloochistan. H. does not use the later name Gedrosia, for which cf. Arr. Anab. vi. 22 seq. On the coast of this country still lives a primitive race which is dark brown (the Brahv\u00ee, but v. i.); so too, on the south-east corner of Arabia, Curzon speaks of the scanty survivors of a 'dark aboriginal race living in the rocks by C. Mussandum' (ii. 447). This race had of course no connexion but that of colour with the Ethiopians of Africa (for whom cf. iii. 17. 1 n. and vii. 70. 1). Lassen (I. A. i. 390) thinks the dark race was perhaps once widely spread in Asia; he quotes the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata for 'black dwellers in the Himalaya'. But he denies that it survives in Beloochistan. The Paricanii are otherwise unknown, but may well be the inhabitants of the interior. Their name is explained by some as = 'worshippers of demons', by others (e. g. Holdich, p. 34) as the Sansk. 'Parvaka' (= mountaineers). H. couples them in vii. 68 with the Utians and Mycans, and the Ethiopians with the Indians (vii. 70. 1). The 18th satrapy seems to have consisted of the southern and eastern parts of the mountainous region which, beginning with the basin of the upper Aras, stretches west to the upper Euphrates and south to the upper Tigris. For the Matieni cf. i. 72. 2 n. The Saspeires lay north of Matiene; they occupy a 'small' district between Media and Colchis (i. 104; cf. iv. 37). Rawlinson, iv. 223, identifies their name with the 'Iberians', but this is very doubtful. The Alarodii are only mentioned here and in vii. 79, where they are again joined with the Saspeires and armed like the Colchians. Sir H. Rawlinson (ib. iv. 245 seq.) sees in their name a survival of the 'Urarda' (cf. Ararat) of the Inscriptions; this is generally accepted (Maspero, iii. 55); they were a Semitic race who preceded the Aryan Armenians in the mountain region north-west of the Assyrian plain (round Lake Van), and who fought the Assyrians at first for supremacy, then for independence. After H. they disappear, being absorbed by the Armenians. The 19th satrapy lay north and north-west of the 18th, north and north-east of the 13th (93. 1), and south of Colchis. All the tribes in it, except the Moschi, lay on the coast of the Black Sea (cf. Xen. Anab. iv. 8 for the Macrones\u2014whose name survives in the Makur Dagh\u2014and v. 5. 2 for the Tibareni); their armament resembles that of the Colchians. The Mares only occur here (and in vii. 79) and in Hec. fr. 192 (F. H. G. i. 12). The Tibareni and Moschi (Assyr. 'Tabali Meshech of Ezek. xxvii. 13 (cf. 32. 26), where they are among the 'merchants of Tyre', trading in slaves and brass; they had long resisted the Assyrians, and seem to have been finally driven into the mountains by the Cimmerian invasion (cf. i. 15 n.). They were independent later (Xen. Anab. vii. 8. 25). *)indw=n. Two questions arise: I. What knowledge had H. of the Indians? II. How far were they under Persian rule? I. The following points may be accepted. H. thinks that (a) the Indians are the most remote nation known on the east; beyond them is desert (98. 2; iv. 40. 2). This idea is based partly on some rumour as to the great deserts east of the Indus, partly on ignorance. As H. knows nothing of mountains in these parts, it is difficult to think (as Rawlinson) that he refers to the great deserts north of the Himalaya. b) The subject Indians are the inhabitants of the lower Indus valley and the modern Sind and part of the Punjab east of the Indus. The wealth of the satrapy compels us to believe that much of the country which is now desert, e. g in Sind, was then irrigated and fertile; but even in Strabo's (p. 697) time part of south Indus valley was qhri/ois ma=llon h)\\ a)nqrw/pois su/mmetros. c) Beyond this region H. knows (1) vaguely of a great population; the Indians are the most numerous race in the world (v. i.). (2) Most of them are utter barbarians (c. 98 seq.). So far as his stories are true, they can only refer to the primitive Dravidian races, who were left behind in the hilly country on the frontier by the tide of Aryan conquest. (3) But he has accurate information of the Indian canoes and cotton dresses (98. 3, 4) and of their respect for animal life (100. 1). d) H. as usual is free from the ridiculous tales which later writers give, e. g. Ctesias (cf. 98. 3; 102 nn.). II. (a) H. (iv. 44. 3) tells us that Darius, after the voyage of Scylax, subdued some Indians and used the Indus as a waterway. This agrees with Darius' inscription at Persepolis, where he puts India among his conquests. H. (102. 1 n.) seems to limit the tributary Indians to the region in north-west India. It is noticeable that Strabo (687) is ignorant of these Persian conquests. b) It is probable that Darius received regular gifts from the trans-Indus tribes, though by the time of Alexander, the Persians had lost all authority beyond that river. H.'s statements here and in v. 3. 1 as to the number of the Indians are implicitly contradicted by Thucydides (ii. 97. 5-6), who says that with the Scyths no nation in Europe or Asia could be compared. Thucydides' narrow Hellenism involves him in a double error: (a) He does not know that the Scyths proper were a comparatively small race (App. XI. 6). (b) He ignores the great populations of the East, of which H. has dimly heard. e(ch/konta kai\\ trihko/sia. The 360 talents, being paid in gold, have to be multiplied by 13 for the reckoning (95. 1). The reading (cf. 89. 2 n.) o)gdw/konta kai\\ o)ktako/sia (for the tessara/konta kai\\ pentako/sia of most MSS.; vid. app. crit.) seems almost certain. For (a) the sum total of all the tributes (less the 140 talents spent in Cilicia, 90. 3) is 7,600 Babylonian talents. This\u2014taking the ratio of 60:78 (89. 2)\u2014gives 9,880 Euboic talents. (b) If the value of the Indian gold be added, i. e. 360 x 13 = 4,680, we have the total 14,560 talents. This reading then both preserves the proper relation of gold and silver, and makes the addition of H. correct, while the other text does neither. For the ratio of the precious metals (really 13.3, not 13) cf. B\u00f6ckh, i. 38 seq.; it varied, but was often reckoned as 10 : 1 (Lys. xix. 42-3, property of Conon; Xen. An. i. 7. 18, 3,000 darics = 10 tals. = 60,000 drs.; Liv. xxxviii. 11). The modern proportion is about 15 1/2 : 1. As the Persian gold was the purest (cf. iv 166. 2), H. rightly gives a higher ratio than the usual. to\\ d' e)/ti ktl. is equivalent to 'I calculate in round numbers, not in fractions'. nh/swn: i. e. the Greek islands in the Aegean. qhsauri/zei. Strabo (731) says there were 40,000 talents found by Alexander in Susa and Persia; cf. also Arr. Anab. iii. 16. 7 (50,000 at Susa alone). Cf. Plut. Alex. 36, and v. 49. 7 n. *ai)qi/opes. For Cambyses' conquests and the Ethiopian gifts cf c. 17 n. Nysa, the birthplace of Osiris, is placed by Diodorus (i. 15) in Arabia Felix; here and in ii. 146. 2 it seems to be in the Upper Nile valley; cf. Hom. Hymn. i. 8 sxedo\\n *ai)gu/ptoio r(oa/wn. Stein identifies it with Gebal Barkal, the 'holy mountain', near the Fourth Cataract and Meroe. The legends of Dionysus place it also in Greece, India, and elsewhere.

B. M. G. Pl. XVI, p. 175 for a picture from the Theban monuments of Ethiopians bringing ebony, gold, &c.

The Circassian beauties are still sold for the Turkish harems. toiw=|de: cf. cc. 102-5. The passage beginning e)/sti th=s *)indikh=s to the end of 101 is a digression on the independent Indians; it reads like a later addition. Lassen (i. 388 seq.) lays stress on its importance as evidence for the extension of primitive non-Aryan tribes into north-west India. He (ii. 635) quotes from an Indian epic, a fish-eating people living on the Sarasvati; this flows into the Run of Cutch, a little east of the Indus. He (ii. 633) says the ka/lamos is not the bamboo proper (Bambusa arundinacea), out of which Indian bows are made (vii. 65), but a similar plant, the 'Kana', which grows over fifty feet high, and correspondingly thick. Ctesias (Ind. 6, p. 248), with characteristic exaggeration, says that 'two men could hardly span it with extended arms'. The flou=s (Att. fle/ws) is the Arundo ampelodesmon; cf. Postans, Sindh, p. 60, for its use by the Miami, a fisherfolk on the Indus, for 'mats' (formou=), &c. H. perhaps borrowing from (cf. iv. 44). o(\\s a)\\n ka/mh|. For this cannibalism cf. iv. 26 n. The name Padaci may be derived from the Sans. 'padja' (bad). Lassen (ii. 635) points out that this is the oldest Western mention of the Brahman hermits (e. g. of their vegetable diet\u2014poihfage/ousi). But if so, H. confuses them with the aboriginal black population (cf. 101. 1). e)mfanh/s. For this lowest depth of bestiality cf. i. 203 n. Aristotle twice refutes this (736 a 10; de Gen. Anim. ii. 2 and 522 a; H. A. iii. 22); he says that H.'s mistaken argument from the black skin is refuted by the white teeth of negroes. The name 'Pactyice' perhaps = 'mountain border land'. Hence it is applied to the districts both on the north-west (cf. 92. 1) and on the south-east of the Iranian plateau (Lassen, i. 434). It perhaps survives in 'Pushtoo', the Afghans' name for themselves. In vii. 85. 1 the 'Pactyic' type of dress is contrasted with the 'Persian'. For Caspatyrus cf. iv. 44. 2 n. These Indians are the only Indians of Aryan stock whom H. knows, apart from the confused reference in c. 100. They are called *de/rdai in Strabo 706 (Ind. Darada). They lived on the southern slopes of the Hindo-Koosh in Kafiristan. For the story of the ants cf. Bunbury, i. 229 f., or (more fully) Lassen, i. 850. We may note as to it (1) Nearchus, Alexander's admiral, had seen the skins of the 'gold-digging which are 'like those of panthers' (Strabo 705); Strabo quotes the story, with additional details (e. g. that meat is put out to distract the attention of the ants), from Megasthenes, who went as ambassador to Sandracottus at Patna circ. 300 B.C., and 'from others' (706); tw=n prosew/|wn kai\\ o)reinw=n *)indw=n'. (2) It was often repeated in the Middle Ages, e. g. in a twelfth-century letter of Prester John (quoted by B\u00e4hr, ad loc.), who gives the ants seven feet and four wings. Busbecq. (Ep. Turc. 4) says that in 1559 a Persian ambassador brought, among other gifts, to the Sultan Soliman at Constantinople, an Indian ant 'magnitudine canis mediocris, animal mordax et saevum'. (3) That ants dug up gold is a genuine Indian story; cf. Wilson, Ariana, pp. 135-6 (quoting the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata), who says the gold paid as tribute was called 'ant gold' (Pipp\u00edlika). There are three facts underlying the story: (a) that ant-heaps contained gold dust; (b) that certain animals and their skins were exported; these may have been marmots, some of which are spotted like panthers; they are certainly burrowing animals; (c) gold is abundant in the mountain chains north-west of India. It is to be noted that H. does not claim to have seen the ants himself, as Ctesias did the still more fabulous Martichora (Ind. fr. 5, p. 356). The word seirhfo/ros, 'pulling by a trace,' seems 1300). gou/nata te/ssera. H. is of course mistaken in giving a camel two knees and two thighs in each of its back legs; but his mistake is due to careful, though unscientific, observation. We may note that (1) he took the heel of the camel for a second knee: this mistake is not unnatural, as a glance at a camel will show, owing to the length of the camel's metatarsal bone. He then infers that, as it had two knees in each leg, it would also have two thighs. (2) The camel appears to have more than one joint in its legs when it kneels to receive a load; Aristotle (Hist. An. ii. 1, 499 a), who corrects H. without naming him, points out that this is due to the way in which the camel doubles its legs under it (dia\\ th\\n u(po/stasin th=s koili/as), as if it were double-jointed. For other explanations of H.'s blunder ta\\ a fact. qermo/tatos ktl. This passage, as to the climate of India, well illustrates H.'s mistaken views of the earth's shape. As he supposes it to be flat, the Indians on the extreme east have the sun nearest to them, and so hottest, in the early morning; this lasts till the time of the 'market's breaking-up' (i.e. about 10 a.m.); as the sun goes west, the day gets cooler. Rawlinson, however, thinks that H. may be reproducing inaccurately a real account of the contrast between the hot mornings and the cool afternoons, when the sun is behind the hills, of the high Indian valleys. For a)gorh=s dialu/sios cf. ii. 173. 1 and iv. 181. 3. kai\\ paralu/esqai, 'are actually cut loose when they begin to drag.' M.

This statement is partly an inference from \u00a7 1, partly a case of 'omne ignotum', &c. As a matter of fact the African elephants and lions are larger than the Indian varieties. For the Nisaean horses cf. vii. 40. 2 n. xruso/s. India is really poor in gold. H.'s statement is partly based on the (exaggerated) mineral wealth of North-west India, partly on a mistaken inference from the dress of the natives (Lassen, i. 238). Our own ancestors similarly exaggerated the wealth of India. karpo\\n ei)/ria . . . profe/ronta. This is the first Western mention of cotton, which, however, grows on a shrub and not on a tree; for the Indians wearing it cf. vii. 65. 1. e)sxa/th. As H. thinks Arabia 'furthest' to the south, he has no conception of the great southern extension of Africa and India. Arabia was reckoned the land of spices, because the trade was mainly in Arab hands; 'white incense' (libanwto/s) grows in Arabia and on the coast of Africa opposite; the brown variety grows in India. (M. Polo, ii. 396, 445 seq.) All the names are Semitic: kasi/h = Heb. = lev\u00f4n\u00e2h, lt, Ass. ladunu, kina/mwmon = kinnmn, probably foreign (cf. 111. 2, 112. 1 for the origin of the names, and L. & S. s. v.kinna/mwmon). The marvels and dangers related by H. (whose knowledge of them is perhaps due to his being a merchant himself) are the fictions of traders anxious both to conceal their market and to enhance the value of their products. The *foinikiko\\n yeu=dos was proverbial; cf. Paus. ix. 28. 2 for a Phoenician snake-story; but according to him the sweetness of the balsam took away the deadliness of its guardian snakes. For the spice trade cf. M\u00f6vers, Phoen. iii. 1. 104; it was already established in the seventh century B.C. stu/rac is also a Semitic word; it is translated 'balm' Gen. xliii. 11. It was an inferior kind of incense and grew especially in Syria. For winged serpents cf. ii. 75. 1; H. here may be adding an Egyptian touch to his Phoenician information. For an expedition to Punt, the land of spices, under the eighteenth dynasty cf. R. of P.1 x. 11, and Brugsch, i. 352 seq. e)xi/dnas. H. carefully distinguishes 'vipers' from other snakes (109. 3). pronoi/h. Xenophanes had taught there was a divine power ruling the universe no/ou freni/ (R. and P., ed. 1888, 89 b). In Anaxagoras this intelligence tended to be divorced from divinity; in H. it develops into a belief in a divine providence that is kind. The early use of the argument from Final Causes is very curious. e)pikui+/sketai: the 'superfoetation' of the hare is recorded by Aristotle (De Gen. An. iv. 5. 773 a), though with fewer details than by H. Platt (Oxf. Tr. p. 190) quotes Sundevall, 'it is not so much the rule as the author thinks, but still it does occur.' There are four stages H. (Hist. An. vi. 31. 579 a 2) rightly styles this story as to the lioness lhrw/dhs; it was invented, he says, to account for the scarcity of lions. The lioness breeds once a year, and has usually three cubs. H. fails to explain how under his system the race of lions survives at all. e)sikne/etai katagra/fwn, translate 'he penetrates scratching it down'. fu/sis: according the 'nature' of serpents. a)poqnh/|skei. H.'s vivid imagination conceives the serpent pair as a sort of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra.

In modern times most of the cassia comes from China, the best cinnamon from Ceylon, whence the name of the plant (C. Zeylanicum). qhri/a pterwta/. Theophrastus (H.

The great birds acting as retrievers are familiar in the story of Sindbad the Sailor; there and in M. Polo (iii. 19), they bring up diamonds. 'The dry sticks' (ka/rfea) are the familiar form in which cinnamon is still exported. Theophrastus (ix. 4. 5) gives a much fuller account of cinnamon: it grows in ravines in Arabia; the best part is the young shoots, the worst that near the roots; altogether five qualities are distinguished. lh/danon. Dioscorides (peri\\ u(/lhs i)atrikh=s i. 128), who wrote tells a similar story. xrh/simon: i.e. for mixing with many kinds of myrrh. Dioscorides (u. s.) says it was used to keep hair from falling off. The construction is the spicy shoreOf Araby the Blest', where for 'many a leagueCheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles', cf. Milton, P. L. iv. 162-5. Agatharchides, a Greek official of high rank in Egypt (circ. 150 B.C.), described not only this (Diod. iii. 45-6) but other marvels in Arabia, e.g. that the sweet-smelling woods were guarded by numerous and deadly 'purple snakes', and also the relaxing effect of the odours; these H. Judiciously omits. o)i+/wn. The Barbary sheep is not now confined to Arabia, but is found in many parts of Africa and North Asia (e.g. the Ovis Steatopyga of Pallas in Asiatic Russia). Its tail is said in some cases to weigh over 70 lbs.; it is still at times protected by wheeled boards. (Wood, Nat. Hist. i. 679-81.) M. Polo notes these sheep in Persia (i. 18), and says they were 'as big as asses'. The play on e(/lkos and e(/lkein is as old as Pind. Pyth. ii. a)poklinome/nhs: lit. 'Ethiopia, as midday declines, extends West', &c.; but the phrases for time and for space are confused; 'as midday declines' = the quarter where midday declines. H. means that Ethiopia is the remotest land he knows to the south-west. The Ethiopians here are 'the long-lived'; cf. c. 17. This chapter illustrates a main principle of H.'s geography; he insists on the evidence of eyewitnesses (iv. 16). Hence he will not accept the existence of sea on the north-west of Europe, and so reaches a wrong conclusion by a right method. *)hridano/n. Three stages may be noted in the use of this name: (1) It seems to have been a general name for rivers. Cf. the Rhodanus (and perhaps the Rhenus) and the Radaune near Dantzig. It may contain the root of the Greek r(e/w, while the 'dan' can be compared with Danube, Don, Dniester, &c. This is not inconsistent with H.'s remark that the name is Greek; in the form *)hridano/s it fits into hexameter verse, and may be connected with h)=ri 'early', so that 'it would be originally an epithet of the sun' (Tozer, A. G. p. 35, who compares 'Phaethon', 'the shining deity'; v. i. for his place in the myth). (2) Hesiod (Theog. 338) is the first Greek to use it, coupling it with the Nile and the Alpheus, but without locating it. Aeschylus (Plin. N. H. xxxvii. 32) made it = the Rhone, which he puts in Spain. (3) H.'s contemporary Pherecydes first made it the Po. This identification was probably due to two causes, (a) myth had connected the origin of amber from the tears of Phaethon's sisters with the Eridanus, (b) the amber route struck the Mediterranean at the head of the Adriatic, i.e. not far from the Po (cf. for amber route iv. 34 nn.). What H. refuses to accept is the Eridanus of legend and its connexion with the growth of amber; Strabo (215) is even more sceptical. e)ou/sas is exist.' The Cassiterides are identified by Strabo (175-6) with the Scilly Isles, where there is no tin. Originally, however, the name 'tin islands' must at any rate have included Britain; it was afterwards applied to imaginary islands; cf. Rice Holmes, Anc. Britain, pp. 483-8, for a full account of the ancient evidence and of modern views as to it; a shorter one is in Tozer, u. s. pp. 37-8. H. declines to commit himself to any of the stories, which were the result of the ignorancc as to the islands. This ignorance was due to Phoenician exclusiveness; Strabo (176) tells how one of their merchants ran his ship on a shoal, to destroy his Roman pursuers. Cf. Diod. v. 22 (quoting Timaeus) for tin-mining in Britain and the tin route across Gaul; the metal was brought from Ictis (St. Michael's Mount) to Corbilo on the Loire 190), and thence e)pi\\ tw=n i(/ppwn, thirty days' journey to the mouth of the Rhone.

This chapter continues the subject of c. 97, i.e. the less organized parts of the Great King's revenue. H.'s tale of the Aces (v.i.) is inconsistent alike with physical laws and with what is known of the position of the tribes mentioned (cf. cc. 92-3 nn.). The idea, however, of the chapter is quite correct; the control of irrigation is in the East one of the prerogatives of government, and great sums are charged for the use of water. Cf. R\u00e9clus, ix. 180, for this in modern Persia. H.'s informants have made a fancy picture out of real facts. It is probable, too, as Meyer suggests (v. i.), that the canalization of the land was intended as a check on the raids of the nomads of the north-east. (Cf. the similar defensive use of canals in Babylonia, i. 185. 1.) The Hyrcanians (cf. 92. 2 n.) are mentioned here, but not in the list of satrapies. The Aces (the name may mean either 'binder' or 'opening' has been variously made the Margus, the Oxus or the Ochus (Wilson, Ariana, p. 129), a confusion of these with the Hilmend (Rennell, pp. 195-6), the Heri-rud (Meyer, iii. 52, 68). The 'sea' has even been identified (St. Croix) with the Sea of Aral. But it is better to regard river and sea as imaginary (v. i.). a)/rdeske, 'watered at one and the same time'; the iterative tense here is used of place, not of time. Cf. the want of.' basile/os. The personal appeal to the king is a genuine Oriental touch. Cf. 119. 3 and Exod. v. 15 (the Israelites and Pharaoh). These chapters give Darius' difficulties in restoring order at home and in the satrapies. An account of the great revolts in the Persian empire (described in the B. I.) would naturally have come in here; but H. only once (i. 130. 2 n., the Median revolt) refers to these, apart from his account (c. 150 seq.) of the revolt of Babylon. He only knows there was widespread confusion (126. 2, 127. 1). Darius (B. I. iv. 18) mentions Intaphrenes first of 'the Seven'; cf. 78 n. for his part in the conspiracy against the Magian. Rawlinson thinks H. underestimates his 'revolt', but cf. 119. 1. a)ggelihfo/ros: cf. 34. 1, 77. 2 for this office. th/n: sc.de/sin. Cf. for the construction v. 72. 4; ix. 37. 1 (where th/n is omitted). For the punishment of the whole family cf. Dan. vi. 24, but Darius here, more merciful than his namesake in the Bible story, spares the women. a)delfeo/s. The preference for a brother over a husband occurs in Soph. Ant. 905-12 (perhaps an interpolation; cf. Jebb, pp. 259 seq., but it certainly was in Aristotle's text of Sophocles; cf. Rhet. iii. 16.9; some ascribe the addition to the poet's son Iophon). The argument certainly seems more natural in the historian than in the dramatist. (Cf. Introd. p. 7.) There are curious parallels in the Indian Epic, the Ramayana, and in a late Persian story. N\u00f6ldeke (Hermes, xxix. 155; cf. also xxviii. 465) thinks the Herodotean version is the original, because in it only two lives are spared, in the Oriental versions all three, husband, brother, and son. He thinks, however, H.'s story and the Indian one are both derived from an older Persian original. The more natural view is that a piece of Greek cleverness has been borrowed in the East. *sardi/wn. H. here as always (except in c. 127) calls the satrapy 'Sardis', not 'Lydia' (v. 25 et pass., and Thuc. i. 115. 4); so too the Persian name for it was Cparda. paqw/n. Diodorus (x. 16 (ii. 206 Teubner)), however, says that Polycrates had given provocation by murdering some Lydians to obtain their wealth. Dascyliun was capital of the Hellespontine satrapy (Thuc. i. 129. 1; Xen. Hell. iv. 1. 15); cf. App. I. *)anakre/onta. A poet was a familiar figure at a tyrant's court. Anacreon afterwards went to Hipparchus (Plat. Hipp. 228). His relations with Polycrates were the subject of a scandal (F. H. G. iv. 299), which H. decently omits, as he does the similar story as to Themistocles and Aristides (Plut. Arist. 2). The main sentence beginning kai/ kws is left incomplete, and the words explaining suntuxi/h which the verbs (metastrafh=nai, u(pokri/nasqai) of the main sentence are attracted. Probably Myrsus (for his name cf. i. 7 n.) was of the old royal house; cf. 15. 2 for the policy of favouring such. So too Pythius (vii. 27. 1 n.) seems to have been a Mermnad. For the death of Myrsus later cf. v. 121. qalassokrate/ein. The idea of 'thalassocracy' was in the air in the fifth century, when Themistocles had revealed its possibilities, and Cimon and Pericles had realized them. Myres (J. H. S. xxvi) has given good reasons for assigning the list of 'thalassocracies' in Eusebius to a fifth-century origin. Fotheringham (ib. xxvii. 88) doubts the date; but his arguments on this point are quite unconvincing, though he makes valuable corrections in Myres' interpretation of the list. H. here for once is more really critical than Thucydides (i. 4), who says, probably by implication in the traditions as to Minos, H. is right in implying that they are not strictly historical. But modern research has here, as elsewhere, largely vindicated the Greek view that the myths contained a large element of history (cf. Burrows, Discoveries in Crete, especially pp. 11-14, for the Minoan empire); Burrows eight 'Minoas' (cf. Fick, Vorg. Ortsn. p. 27) scattered from Syria to Sicily, may perhaps reveal the greatness of their founder (cf. the 'Alex andrias' and 'Antiochs' of the fourth and third centuries. The argument that founders' names are not given to colonies till quite late proves nothing against this; for the Greek colonies from the eighth century onwards were founded by republics, not by kings. Maeandrius is the only early instance known of a Greek bearing his father's name; the practice became common in the fourth century (Rawlinson). The reference to the Heraeum shows the source of this story (in part; no doubt another part came through Democedes). la/rnakas ktl. Nepos (Hann. 9) tells a like story of Hannibal; the trick of the Egestaeans was more elaborate (Thuc. vi. 46). lou=sqai. The expression 'washed by Zeus' is suggestive of the physical explanations of the fifth century, which identified the gods with the powers of nature. e)pefhmi/zeto. For this attempt to check an enterprise by 'using ominous words' cf. the curses of Ateius Capito against Crassus in 54 B. C. (Plut. Crass. c. 16). megaloprepei/hn. Just as H. thinks the greatest of Greek temples those of Ephesus and Samos, so here he holds Polycrates to have been more magnificent than Pisistratus; the comparison is significant. a)poktei/nas. H., like a true Greek, gives here no details of Asiatic barbarity; he is less reticent in iv. 202. *sa/mioi. Oroetes hoped to form a Persian party in Samos; cf.

'after the rule of the Magian'; this was itself, according to one of his 'sources' (65. 5 and App. V. 6), 'the taking away of empire from the Persians by the Medes.' u(pei/sas. For such a method of dealing with a messenger sent to recall a governor cf. 127. 3 n. Oroetes had secured the Phrygian satrapy (120. 2 n.) by the murder of its satrap (126. 2). H. nowhere else uses these names for the West Anatolian satrapies; it is probable that the story of Oroetes came to him from Democedes, who naturally knew nothing of the official Persian names. Rawlinson says that Ali Pacha, the semi-independent ruler of Albania at the beginning of the nineteenth century, made away with the Sultan's messengers sent to depose him. sfrhgi=da: cf. Esther iii. 12, viii. 8 for a decree made binding by the royal seal, and Thuc. i. 129 for the showing of the seal. a)piko/menos ktl. this passage is interesting as showing the ties which held the Persian empire together and limited the powers of the satraps; cf.

Stein translates 'sank their spears to Bagaeus', i. e. recognized him as their new leader; he compares 'summissis fascibus' (Liv. ii. 7). But the use of meqi/hmi in ix. 62. 1 rather suggests the sense 'let go their spears', i.e. no longer stood at attention. oi( then would be Oroetes. The whole scene is worked up by H. with picturesque details. The story of Democedes is skilfully introduced by H. as a link between the two main parts of his subject; it both fits on to the events which accompanied the accession of Darius and introduces the aggression against Europe. For Kirchhoff's argument as to Herodotean chronology based on it cf. Intr. \u00a7 10 (pp. 9-12). It need hardly be said that the importance assigned to Democedes is not historical; the 'curtain lecture of Atossa' (Macan) is a popular invention to account for events whose causes lay far deeper (cf. Introd. \u00a7 32, p. 45). H. seems to be blending a Crotoniate story with details heard at Halicarnassus (c. 138 n.), and with Persian stories as to the influence of Atossa. For Egyptian physicians cf. ii. 84 n. Darius, however, restored the Egyptian college of surgery at Sais (Z. F. A.

Apart from humour of the rapid increase in a fashionable physician's fees, the story is interesting as one of the earliest accounts of state endowments for medical science. (Cf. Mahaffy, S.

Were disproof of the story needed, this supposed intention of attacking Greece before Scythia would alone be sufficient. The knowledge shown of Greece is inconsistent with other passages, e. g. v. 105 (as to Athens); the historian in such narratives as these aims at dramatic propriety and not at historic accuracy. Cf.

A 'king' at Tarentum at the end of the sixth century may be explained (with B\u00e4hr) as a survival of Spartan institutions in a Spartan colony; the story of the foundation of Tarentum by the Partheniae is doubtful (cf. Busolt, i. 406 seq.), but certainly Tarentum received Laconian Dorians as colonists at some period. Others suggest less probably that the 'king' was a 'tyrant'. ta\\ phda/lia. Athenaeus (522), improving on the narrative here given, says the Persians were robbed of their robes and a slave invested with them, an act commemorated afterwards in the official dress of the magistrate's servant at Croton. e)kxrh/sei: cf. viii. 70. 1 for a similar use ( = a)poxra/w, cf. 138. 2); but here it is impersonal. *mi/lwnos qugate/ra. This Crotoniate story na\u00efvely credits the Great King with the Greek love of athletes. Apuleius (Florida, 15) says that Gillus, 'princeps' of Croton, ransomed Pythagoras from Cambyses; the patriotism of Gillus is an effective contrast to the unscrupulous conduct of Democedes. Both Cnidus and Tarentum were Dorian towns, perhaps both Laconian colonies, an even closer bond of union. prw=toi. H. is conscious that the story of Democedes may be thought a digression and so explains its relevance. The conquest of Samos by the Persians. The whole story is more than suspicious. (1) It has impossible elements. If Darius had been in Egypt (which is doubtful, though not inconsistent with the B. I.) he certainly was not there as a common guardsman; he was next heir to the throne after his father Hystaspes. (2) It is needless. The Persian policy always was to use Greek tyrants in the border states. (3) Its moral is too obvious; it is a Greek version of 'Cast thy bread upon the waters'. prw/thn. Stein (cf. vi. 109. 3) explains prw/thn of the 'importance' of Samos. It is more natural (as Rawlinson) to make it chronological; H. was ignorant (cf. 150 n.) of the double capture of Babylon, and knew very little of the great rebellions (521-519 B.C.). But cf. c. 118 n. *ai)/gupton. Under the rule of the native Egyptian kings Greeks had been confined to the Delta (ii. 154, 178 nn.); they now penetrated into Middle and Upper Egypt. Among these early sightseers may have been Hecataeus. purrh/n. The position is emphatic; so 'The cloak of Syloson' became a proverb for ostentation (P. G. ii. 772). qei/h| tu/xh|, 'by a heaven-inspired chance' (not a cf. i. 126. 6; iv. 8. 3. eu)erge/ths. For the royal 'benefactors' cf. viii. 85. 3 n. h)/ tis h)/: a colloquialism, = 'hardly any'. The commendation (cf. that of Cadmus, vii. 164. 1) is significant of H.'s own feeling towards tyranny. Cf. Appendix XVI. 1. The story of Maeandrius is full of touches which show H.'s familiarity with Samos (145. 1, 146. 2). i(erwsu/nhn. The priesthood was necessary to secure Maeandrius from being punished for his service to the tyrant. For other grants of priesthoods cf. iv. 161. 3; vii. 153. 3. gegonw/s . . . kakw=s. The low birth of Maeandrius would recommend him to the tyrant. (Cf. Arist. Pol. 1314 aponhro/filon h( turanni/s.) He was a citizen (123. 1), but is called h(me/teros dou=los by Syloson (140. 5). So Micythus, oi)ke/ths e)w/n, was appointed ruler of Tarentum by Anaxilaus (vii. 170. 4 n.). Lycaretus was afterwards made despot in Lemnos (v. 27. 1). The dh/ well expresses the irony of H. gorgu/rh is properly a 'drain'; hence an underground dungeon. The di/fros was a footstool, which the Great King and his representatives in the field used, when stepping from a chariot (so Dinon in Athen. 514 a); others (e. g. Rawlinson) translate 'litter'; cf. Dio, c. 60. 2 (it was introduced by Claudius into Roman ceremonial). The present participle may imply that these Persians had the right to use a di/fros, not that they were actually using them. Others, again, explain it by the qro/nous of c. 144. For the position of Cleomenes cf. App. XVII. For the Lacedaemonians as the recognized heads of Greece between 550 and 480 B. C. cf. i. 69. 2 n. For saghneu/santes cf. vi. 31 n. The immediate massacre (147. 1) was followed by thorough depopulation; e(/khti *sulosw=ntos eu)ruxwri/h became a proverb (Strabo 638, who, however, attributes it, and the decay of population that gave rise to it, to the 'harsh rule' of Syloson). As Samos in 494 B. C. was able to equip sixty triremes (vi. 8), it is probable that popular dislike of the tyrant exaggerated the severity of this conquest. The Revolt of Babylon and its capture by Darius. I. The general outline of the events is told by Darius in the B. I. (cf. Maspero, iii. 675 seq. for a brilliant sketch). Susiana and Babylon (B. I. i. 16) revolted within a fortnight of the death of Smerdis; the leader of the latter pretended to be the son of Nabonidus, and took the name Nebuchadnezzar. While Darius was besieging Babylon, nine other provinces revolted (ii. 2), including Persia, Media, and Parthia. After Darius had captured Babylon (ii. 1), how he does not say, though he mentions two great victories over the Babylonians, he proceeded against the other rebels. While he was reducing them, another pretender rose and seized Babylon (iii. 13), but was reduced, apparently without difficulty, by Intaphrenes (iii. 14). There are thus two revolts and two captures of Babylon. II. There is, however, some uncertainty whether the story of H. refers to either. Ctesias (22, p. 69) says that the stratagem of Zopyrus belongs to his son Megabyzus, and to the capture of Babylon by Xerxes (478 B. C.). The view that this is the siege referred to is very generally adopted, e. g. by Sayce, ad loc., N\u00f6ldeke, E. B.9 18. 572 (doubtfully), Lehmann, W. f\u00fcr K. P. 1900, p. 963. The reasons are: (a) It is impossible to fit a siege of twenty months (153. 1) into the record of the B. I. (But the chronology of that record is most uncertain, and in ii. 2 it seems to imply a long resistance.) (b) Lehmann (u. s.) tries to fit in H.'s 'nineteen months' (c. 152) with dates given by the Babylonian tablets for Xerxes (but there are at least two uncertain quantities in his equation). (c) The cruelty of the victor (159. 2) is more like the character of Xerxes. Duncker, however, and Maspero accept the narrative of H., and the latter (iii. 677 n.) supports his view also from the Babylonian tablets. It seems safer to follow H., for (a) he had good evidence; Zopyrus, the grandson of the chief actor in the events, deserted to Athens about 440 B. C. (160. 2 n.); (b) the elder Zopyrus was certainly made satrap of Babylon. III. (1) In the details of H. there is certainly exaggeration and Greek colouring (v. i.). His chronology too is impossible (150. 1 n.). (2) The story of the self-devotion of Zopyrus is generally rejected; Sayce (ad loc., who accepts the mutilation itself as a fact) and Sir H. Rawlinson (ad c. 155) argue that no mutilated person could have held rule; but (a) the scars of Zopyrus would have been offensive to no one but the Babylonians; (b) the position of Darius needed desperate measures, and some explanation must be found for his capture of an impregnable city; (c) the silence of Darius in the B. I. proves nothing; it certainly would have been inconsistent with the whole tone of the inscription to describe how desperate his position had been; (d) Polyaenus (vii. 11. 8) confirms H., and says the stratagem was borrowed from a Sacian chief, Risaces (for the war to which this story belongs cf. App. V. 9); he, after proving his loyalty by self-mutilation, led Darius into the desert. This story, which is told in great detail, whether it be true or not, shows that Polyaenus is not simply reproducing the narrative of H.; (e the fact that the story is told by Persian poets of native heroes (Sir H. Rawlinson), and by Livy (i. 53) of Sextus Tarquinius, proves nothing against its having really happened once long before. It seems safer, therefore, to accept the story as having, at any rate, a basis of fact. *babulw/nioi. H. implies that the revolt followed at once on the suppression of the Magian conspiracy; this is correct, but it is not consistent with his general narrative, which implies a considerable interval; for the healing of Darius followed 'not long after' the overthrow of Oroetes (129. 1); then comes the expedition of Democedes (133. 1), and 'after this' that against Samos (139. 1), 'contemporary with which' is the revolt of Babylon. H. puts together, without any real chronology, independent narratives, of which he knows only that they all belong to the early years of Darius. sitopoio/n. So the Plataeans kept 110 'breadmakers' (Thuc. ii. 78. 3), though they disposed of their non-combatants in a less drastic way. But Babylon was far from being in such a desperate position as the Plataeans; they might well expect success, as the Persian power seemed shaken. h(mi/onon. The female mule can bear offspring, though this is rare (E. B.9 xvii. 13); Aristotle (Hist. Anim. vi. 24) asserts it of the mules in Syria, though he had before stated (de Gen. Anim. ii. 8) to\\ tw=n h(mi/onwn ge/nos o(/lon a)\\gono/n e)sti. the prophecy is a mythical embellishment; Ctesias (u. s.) seems to have omitted it, but in his other details he agreed with H., though contradicting him on the main point. H. (vii. 57. 2) tells a still more wonderful story of mule-birth. For a similar prophecy on the part of the besieged at Veii, leading to the capture of the town, cf. Livy v. 15. e)s to\\ pro/sw, 'to the advancement of greatness'; cf. i. 5. 3 for the phrase; and for the custom, Esther vi. 3; for 'benefactors' cf. viii, 85. 3 n. For Assyrians cf. i. 178. 1 n. tw=n sw=n deh/sh|, 'unless there be some failure on your part'; we should have expected tw=n sw=n ti e)ndeh/sh| (cf. vii. 18). *semira/mios. The gates of Semiramis look like a piece of Greek imagination; they may, however, be placed in the south-west (cf. i. 181. 2, 184 nn. for her connexion with the Nebo temple in Borsippa). Of the other gates that of 'the Ninevites' would be on the north, that of 'the Chaldaeans' on the south, by the river, on the way to their early home (i. 181. 5 n.). That of 'Belus' would be in the south also, near (cf. 158. 2) the Esagila temple (i. 181. 2 n.), the 'Cissian' on the east (cf. 91. 4). The details, if fictions, are skilfully arranged to cover all sides of Babylon. The balana/gra (not klei/s, as the gate is large) was an iron hook for extracting the ba/lanos from the bar (moxlo/s; cf. Thuc. ii. 4. 3). The picturesque details of this story (e. g. e)pistrefo/menos, o)li/gon ti p. and others) mark the born narrator; it is interesting to compare H.'s fulness here with the pr\u00e9cis-like brevity of his accounts of manners and customs. But the Babylonian assembly (ta\\ koina/) is a purely Greek detail. The destruction of the walls (cf. i. 178. 1 n.) explains the easy success of Intaphrenes in suppressing the second revolt (u. s.). a)neskolo/pise. Darius, B. I. (ii. 13, 14), mentions this punishment for the rebel leaders only. a)gaqoergi/hn. Xenophon (Cyr. i. 2. 1) for once is right in describing the Persian esteem for Apoph. s.v.*darei/ou; Mor. 173) characteristically exaggerates this to '100'. Cf. iv. 143 for a similar compliment to Megabyzus. dw=ra. For royal gifts cf. 84. 1. As Babylon paid 1,000 talents a year (92. 1), this grant can hardly refer to the whole tribute. For Megabyzus' success in Egypt cf. Thuc. i. 109; he afterwards quarrelled with the king, because the safe-conduct he had given to Inaros was violated; cf. 15 n. and Ctesias (34 seq., p. 72 seq.), who goes on to describe, in an important passage too long to quote, his subsequent relations with the king, the desertion of Zopyrus to Athens, and his death at Caunus. For the story of Ctesias, and especially for the phil-Hellenic leanings of the family of Megabyzus and the date of the desertion of Zopyrus, cf. J. H. S. xxvii. 57 seq., 'The Persian friends of Herodotus,' where an attempt is made (1) to connect the desertion of Zopyrus with the Samian War of 440-439 B. C. (cf. Thuc. i. 115, and Introd. p. 8); (2) to show that H. probably met him in Athens in 440 and derived from him such passages as iii. 80 seq., 90 seq., v. 52 seq.; (3) to date H.'s departure for the West 440 B. C., which would account for the fact that he says nothing of the death of Zopyrus. This took place (Ctes. 43, p. 74) when the Athenians were besieging Caunus in Caria (probably in 439 B. C.; cf. Busolt, iii. 554-5 for the relations of Athens and Persia at this time). This date would be important if it could be accepted. Kirchhoff, however (cf. Introd. p. 10 f.), dates Zopyrus' desertion '438 or probably later'. Rawlinson is certainly wrong in placing it in 426 or 425 B. C., as 'probably the latest event recorded by H.' BOOK IV [For the *skuqikoi\\ lo/goi cf. K. Reinach, Antiquit\u00e9s de Russie (1891-2).] This book falls into two parts, cc. 1-144 giving the account of Scythia and the Scythian expedition, cc. 145-205 the story of Cyrene. Except Book II, no part of H.'s narrative has so little to do with his main subject, while none is so rich in curious information, much of which is invaluable to the anthropologist. The account of the Scythians especially is important as the earliest study we possess of an uncivilized people. Nothing is more instruc tive, in estimating the difference between the points of view of H. and of Thucydides, than to compare the former's full-length study of the Scythians with the brief sketch of Macedonia and Thrace given by the latter (ii. 97; cf. 81. 1 n.); H. is the type of the earlier Greek, to whom all knowledge and all the world were of interest, Thucydides of the Periclean Athenian, who concentrated himself on the political affairs of Greece in the narrowest sense. The motives for Darius' campaign (for a discussion of these cf. App. XII. 3-4). au)tou=: emphatic; the king led in person. Cf. vii. 10 h. For the Scythian invasions cf. i. 104-6 nn., for the Cimmerian i. 15 nn. dou/lous. The information in this chapter is better than the logic; Stein suggests with reason that it is a later addition. The idea that the slaves were blind may be due to a mistaken etymology for some Scythian word for 'slave' (Stein; cf. 86. 4 n.), and perhaps to the fact that blindness is common in South Russia. Blind slaves obviously would be useless, nor does H. explain why they were blinded. fushth=ras. Pallas (Nachr. Mong. V\u00f6lk. i. 119) in the eighteenth century describes a similar operation among the Calmucks to induce 'obstinate' cows to give milk. qhle/wn i(/ppwn.

The Hippemolgi and the Abii were supposed to be nations, and credited with all the virtues of the 'noble savage'; these vain imaginations are not found in H., but they lasted as late as Ammianus (fourth century A.

G. ii. 220, fr. 26; flor. circ. 390 B. C.) were born of Spartan women during the absence of the Spartans in the First Messenian War, presumably of Helot fathers, though Her. Pont. does not say so. ta/fron. This trench extends from the Tauric Mountains to the P. Maeotis; as H. was quite ignorant of the shape of the Crimea (cf. 99 n.), he conceives it (20. 1) as running north and south, and as the eastern boundary of the 'Royal Scyths'. B\u00e4hr quotes evidence of the remains of a trench in the east of the Crimea, from near Theodosia to the Sea of Azov (cf. also Klio, iv. 183). Some have seen in the story a confused account of the 'Putrid Sea', the western arm of the Sea of Azov. It may be noted that 'the trench' plays no part in the actual struggle between the Scyths and their slaves. This 'trench' must not be confused with the cutting across the Isthmus of Perekop, which still existed in the Middle Ages. *oi(=a poieu=men. The whole story is evidently a Greek fiction to illustrate the proper way of controlling slaves. The origin of the Scyths. H. gives three different versions, the Scythian and the Pontic Greek, which are mythological, and a third (c. 11 seq.), which he adopts as resting on the authority of both nations (12. 3), and which he partially confirms by quoting Aristeas (c. 13), who differs only as to the race which drove the Scyths into their new country. This last version is accurate in two points: (a it recognizes the earlier possession of the country by the Cimmerians; (b) it gives a vera causa, an early 'V\u00f6lkerwanderung'; but it is full of legendary details. new/taton. Justin (ii. 1), on the contrary, says the Scyths were gens antiquissima; for these early ethnological disputes cf. ii. 2. ge/neos. For the name Targitaus (a genuine native name) cf. Polyaen. viii. 55, Tirgitao. For the artificial genealogy cf. Tac. Germ. 2, Mannus and his three sons. The names do not appear subsequently in H.; but the triple kingship (c. 120) may have suggested both it and the similar division in 7. 2. For the success of the youngest cf. 10. 2 (the story of the Pontic Greeks), the story of Perdiccas (viii. 137), and popular legends passim, e. g.that of Cinderella. For the 'burning gold' cf. the popular superstition in modern Russia of buried treasures which turn to hot coals when discovered (Reinach, A. R. M. p. 160). *au)xa/tai . . . *kati/aroi. Pliny (iv. 88), speaks of the Auchetae in South Russia. He also mentions (vi. 22) them as in the Causasus; in vi. 50 he mentions the Euchatae and Cotieri as nomad tribes on the north of the Jaxartes. Perhaps these last are remnants of the Scyths left in their original home (cf. 11. 1 n.), whose name just survives in their new home, but has no practical importance. Minns, however (E. B. xxiv. 526), ingeniously suggests that this legend belongs to the agricultural Scyths, who were a conquered race, and not 'Scyths' at all, but 'Scoloti' (\u00a7 2); the objects ('cup, plough, yoke') are not such as would be held sacred by nomads. H. seems to connect Scoloti with Colaxais (tou= basile/os e)pwnumi/hn); perhaps we may compare (c. 78), but v. s. xili/wn. The number '1,000' obviously rests on no tradition; if it is not a mere round number, it is only a calculation based on royal genealogies. mete/rxontai, 'they honour' it (cf. vi. 68. 2 n.). dia\\ tou=to: i.e. as reward for his year's watching. The whole story is oddly introduced, and does not agree with the later details of Scythian worship (e.g. contrast the golden sa/garis here with the iron a)kina/khs of 62. 2). Nor is it easy to reconcile the grant of 'a day's circuit' with the habits of a nomadic people. H. repeats some ancient story as to a guarded gold treasure (cf. the wealth of the Nibelungs), but without understanding it. Reinach, however (A. R. M. p. 160), says the Calmucks have a custom of granting a man as much land as he can ride round in a day. ta\\ de\\ katu/perqe. The Scythian tradition excludes the 'lands that lie above to the north, of those who dwell in the upper parts of the country', while the Greek tradition takes in the Agathyrsi and Geloni (10. 1). For the 'feathers' cf. c. 31 n. The Greek story. The Greeks as usual introduced their mythology into the country where they settled; it will be noticed they explain only the origin of the Scythian kings. Such fictions could both justify present occupation (e.g. the Heraclidae in Peloponnese), and (e.g. Dorieus and the land of Eryx) give ground for future claims (v. 43; cf. c. 178 n.). There are of course native features in the story, e.g. the number of the sons (9. 3). For the story of Geryon in its earlier form cf. Hes. Theog. 287; Hecataeus (Arr. Anab. ii. 16.5) had localized it near Ambracia; H. therefore is emphatic on its belonging to the extreme west. ta\\s 'the red island,' probably with reference to the setting sun. Cadiz is really built on a rocky island connected by a long spit of land with the Isla de Leon; but it is most unlikely that H. knew anything definite of its site or neighbourhood. For the pillars of Hercules cf. ii. 33. 3 n. *)wkeano/n. For the circumambient ocean cf. ii. 21 n.; for H.'s insistence on geographical proof cf. iii. 115. 2 n. a(/rmatos. The horse and chariot is perhaps a bit of local colour; they are not generally part of the Heracles myth. *(ulai/hn: cf. 18. 1 n. The 'grotto' is part of the legendary furniture of the Echidna story; cf. Hes. Theog. 297. diateino/menon.

The Scyths pictured on the vases carry no cups; Stein explains the fia/lh as the broad flat clasp on which the girdle ends fasten; but this is not what H. says (\u00a7 3). Agathyrsus and Gelonus represent the tribes to the north-west and the north-east respectively of Scythia proper (cf. c. 104; v. 108).

H.'s own view. It is to be noted that here he adopts in a qualified manner a combination adopted elsewhere (i. 103; iv. 1) without reserve. For the facts generally in cc. 11 and 12 cf. i. 15 nn. For the Araxes cf. i. 202 n.; here it seems to be the Volga. qa/yai. That there were tombs of a previous race on the Dniester is probable; H. may have seen them himself. If they were Cimmerian, their position in the west of Scythia tends to prove that the race migrated\u2014in part at least \u2014south-west, not south-east, and this would be the natural line of retreat before invaders from the east. H. gives further evidence for Cimmerians in Scythia, partly archaeological, partly that of names: it is curious that 'Crimea' has survived all the other names for the land. The tei/xea are perhaps the still surviving dyke on the isthmus of Taman, i. e. on the east side of the straits. Strabo (494) says there was once a town, *kimmeriko/n, 'closing the isthmus with a ditch and a dyke.' The 'straits' are those of Jenikale, the narrowest part of the Cimmerian Bosporus, leading into the Sea of Azov. The connexion of the Cimmerians and Sinope is well authenticated, and seems to have been early. In the poem that is attributed to Scymnus of Chios (apparently written circ. 100 B. C.) they are said (l. 948) to have 'killed Habron the Milesian' there. The main Cimmerian raid in the seventh century is mentioned later (l. 952). According to the chronologers, Trapezus, the daughter state of Sinope, was founded 756 B.C.; but Busolt (i. 465-6) thinks the Milesian colonization of the Black Sea belongs to the seventh century, although they had factories there already in the eighth. He argues with reason that the Greek towns on the Black Sea must be later than the foundation of Byzantium (657 B.C.). The 'second' colonization of Sinope was dated 630. We may conclude that a band of Cimmerians occupied Sinope in the latter half of the eighth century; the main body of the nation reached Asia Minor half a century later. *)ariste/hs. H. confirms his own view against the Scyths, who claimed autochthony, by a reference to the *)arima/spea of Aristeas; the latter, however, makes the pressure of invasion come from the Issedones, i. e. from the north-east (not the east as H.). Aristeas seems to have embodied in this poem the earliest knowledge obtained by the settlers on the North Pontic shore. He is placed by H. (15. 1) in the first half of the seventh century, but Suidas makes him a contemporary of Croesus. This date is accepted in Pauly (s. v.), because his poem explained the Cimmerian invasion; but this fact is consistent with the early date. There is no need to deny his historic reality (as Crusius in Rosch. i. 2814), but his story has obviously been affected by cult stories of Apollo. For him cf. Pindar, fr. 271. His poem had perished by the time of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Thuc. 23; vi. 864), but Tzetzes (Chil. vii. 690-1) quotes some lines supposed to be from it (as to the Arimaspi): poie/wn. H. emphasizes the poetic character of Aristeas. Cf. foibo/lamptos. gru=pas. The 'griffins' are combined with the Arimaspi also by Aeschylus (P. V. 802-4), who calls them o)cu/stomoi *zhno\\s a)kragei=s ku/nes. Two types of them may be distinguished; the more common has the head and wings of an eagle, the body of a lion; this type may be Hittite, but is found in Egypt as early as the eighteenth dynasty, and in prehistoric Greece (Perrot et Chipiez, vi. 831); the other type, the winged lion, is Chaldaean. This symbol was combined in Greek art, from the fifth century onwards, with the story here told by H. from Aristeas; in this story we have probably a double of that of the 'ants' (iii. 102), i. e. it is a traveller's tale as to the dangers of gold-getting in Central Asia. The wide diffusion of this combination in later Greek art is good evidence of the popularity of H.'s work. Ctesias (Ind. 12, p. 250) transports the griffins to the north of India, and substitutes them for the 'ants' of H. (u. s.); it is characteristic of him that he describes them in detail, with 'white wings, red breast', &c. For the whole subject of 'griffins' cf. Furtw\u00e4ngler in Rosch. Lex. i. 1742 seq. The gold of Central Asia is of course a fact, and the Arimaspi may well be a nomad tribe of Central Asia, who affirmed that their gold was derived from great deserts, e. g. that of Gobi; they may be the ancestors of the Turks and the Huns. They were credited with one eye as a mark of their wildness, on the analogy of the Cyclops; Strabo (21) puts the matter the other way and makes Homer 'borrow' the Cyclops from Scythia. Others see in them a purely fictitious people, a wild counterpart of the mild Hyperboreans. The name is explained by some 'dwellers in the deserts' (Rosch. s. v.), but M\u00fcllenhof (iii. 106) makes it 'having docile horses'. Pauly, ii. 827, translates it 'owners of wild horses'. H.'s etymology is no doubt that of the people of Olbia. It is to the credit of H. that he does not believe in the 'one-eyed' (iii. 116. 2), and that he avoids such foolish rationalization as that of Eustathius, who said (G. G. M. ii. 223) the Arimaspi had one eye smaller than the other, because, being archers, they were continually closing one eye to shoot. The whole legend is familiar in Milton's As when a gryphon through the wildernessPursues the Arimaspian, who by stealthHad from L. ii. 943-7.) plh\\n *(uperbore/wn: because the Hyperboreans lived in perpetual peace. For them cf. 32 nn. noti/h|: here the 'Black Sea' as contrasted with the sea to the north (cf. e)pi\\ qa/lassan above); H. himself calls it 'the Northern Sea' in c. 37. The story of Aristeas (also used by Pindar, fr. 271) is interesting from two points of view. (1) It seems to be connected with the Pythagorean theory of transmigration; Metapontum was near Croton, the special home of Pythagoreanism. (2) It shows H. at once as a traveller (15. 4 n.) and as a collator of various traditions. Artaca (vi. 33. 2) lay to the west of Cyzicus, of which it was the seaport. H.'s figure '240' is probably based on a calculation of generations. *metaponti=noi. The cult of Apollo at Metapontum is reflected in its coins (Head, H. N. p. 76, fig. 36); the god is shown as dafnhfo/ros or with a laurel tree before him (cf. da/fnai e(sta=siinf.). to/te: after 'his second disappearance' he had come to Italy. The 'raven' was sacred to Apollo (Ael. H. A. i. 48) as a prophetic bird (cf. Hor. Odes, iii. 27. 11'oscen corvus', the 'crow'). e)s *delfou/s. For as the controller of cults and canonizer cf. Farnell, G. C. iv. 206-8. The a)/galma is the 'altar' of \u00a7 2; H. clearly speaks as an eyewitness. One of the laurels at any rate was of brass (Theop. fr. 182; F. H. G. i. 309). H.'s account of the geography of Scythia. In the middle of this is a digression on general geography (37-45). The first part (17-27) contains the ethnography; H. (16-20) gives the tribes from west to east, in each case adding the tribes inland as far as known; cf. the refrain o(/son h(mei=s i)/dmen at end of cc. 17, 18, 20. He then goes (21-2) from south to north. For the whole subject cf. App. XI, and cc. 102-17 nn., which should be read with cc. 17-27. au)to/ptew. For the importance of 'eyewitnesses' cf. iii. 115. 2. H. is obviously sceptical whether Aristeas really got as far as he claimed 'in his poem'. *borusqenei+te/wn e)mpori/on. The 'mart of the Borysthenites' is Olbia, on the right bank of the Hypanis (hod. Boug), which flows into the same bay as the Dnieper. H.'s site (53. 6) has been confirmed by exploration. He calls it the 'city of the Borysthenites' (78. 3, 79. 2), but says that its own name for itself was Olbia (18. 1). This last point is confirmed by the coins (Head, H. N. 272). It was founded by the Milesians (78. 3) in 647 B. C., and was the oldest colony beyond the Danube. H. (101. 2) says the Borysthenes was ten days' journey from the Danube, and ten from the P. Maeotis, so it is mesai/taton. *kallippi/dai: these 'Greek Scyths' were probably a mixed race (cf. Boeckh, C. I. G. ii. 2058 mice/llhnes in a long psephism of Olbia probably dating about 100 B. C.). It may be doubted whether any of the Scyths but the 'Royal' tribe (c. 20) were pure-blooded. Rawlinson quotes interesting modern parallels for races in a similar transitional stage of civilization. Strabo (550) says that H. 'talked rubbish about' the Callippidae and the Alazones; but he says they were mentioned also by Hellanicus. si=ton. For the importance of the Pontic corn trade cf. Demos. in Lept. f., 159 f. *(ulai/h. The region on the left bank of the lower Dnieper was once well wooded\u2014at least in comparison to most of South Russia (cf. 109. 2 for woods among Budini), the bareness of which H. well describes (c. 19). Dio Chrys. (Or. 36) compares the trees of the Hylaea to 'masts of ships'. Neumann, H. S. (pp. 82 seq.) quotes Rubruquis in the thirteenth century and others to prove there were once forests in South Russia, where now there are none: he sums up 'the steppes are gradually encroaching; their desolation in the Middle Ages was less complete than it is to-day, and following the same law, we can maintain that it had advanced even less in Classical times'. gewrgoi/. The distinction between the 'husbandmen Scyths' and the 'ploughmen Scyths' (c. 17) lies in the fact that the latter grew corn only to sell, the former practised husbandry generally. In 53. 4, H., perhaps following a different informant, gives them 'ten days'' extent; probably they reached as far as the rapids of the Dnieper. For the Androphagi cf. c. 106 n. tesse/rwn kai\\ de/ka. In 101. 2 (see n.) the whole distance from the Borysthenes to the P. Maeotis is 'ten days'; here part of it is 'fourteen'. For the inconsistency cf. App. XI. 3. basilh/ia. Strabo (311) says the royal Scyths levied 'fixed moderate tributes'. The position of the Golden Horde among the Mongols is a parallel. ta/fron. For 'the trench' cf. 3. 1 n.; for Cremni 110. 2 n. pro\\s bore/hn. Stein points out that the cultivating Scyths really bounded the royal Scyths on the north; but H. does not know of the great bends of the Dnieper and the Don. Really his eastern frontier line for the 'royal Scyths', i. e. the Trench, P. Maeotis, and Tanais, ran north-east and not due north as he conceives it. For the Melanchlaeni cf. c. 107 n. The tribes north-east of Scythia. As to the general geography it may be noted: (1) H. claims, and with reason, to speak from knowledge as far as 'the Bald men' (24. 1). This was no doubt derived from the merchants using the north-east trade route, which ran across the steppes into Central Asia. This was superseded under the Roman empire by that via Trebizond (Beazley, Dawn of G. i. 179), but used in the Middle Ages, e. g. by Carpini c. 1250 (ib. ii. 296 f.). (2) H. knows the route is north by east (cf. 22. 1, 3 a)pokli/nonti pro\\s th\\n h)w=), but wrongly thinks it mainly north. (3) H. here knows nothing of the Volga (cf. 124. 1 n.), and his mountains (25. 1) seem to be a confusion of the Ural and the Altai; their distance would correspond to the Ural, but they run east and west (25. 1 n.) as the Altai Mountains do; perhaps H., though disbelieving in the fabulous Rhipaean Mountains, has allowed himself to be misled by their supposed position, east and west. It may be taken as certain that his informants knew nothing of the mountains except as something to be avoided. (4) His description of the 'black earth belt' (23. 1) is accurate (for it cf. E. B.11 xxiii. 881). Westberg (Klio, iv. 183 seq.) identifies his tribes thus: (1) The Sauromatae extend from the Manitch, a tributary on the left bank of the Don, to Kamischin on Volga in south of the Saratov province. (2) The Budini are in the Saratov province as far north as Syzran; an Arab geographer of the tenth century describes this country as well wooded (cf. c. 21 dase/an). (3) The desert north of Budini (22. 1) in the region of the Singelei hills on right bank of Volga, near Simbirsk. (4) The route then turns east (23. 1), up the valley of the Kama; the Thyssagetae (c. 22) live on the R. Bielaya nearly to the southern Ural. (5) The Argippaei live in the 'foot hills' (23. 2) south of the Ural, while beyond the Ural on the south-east (25. 2) are the Issedones, north-east of Caspian; cf. i. 201, the Massagetae live 'opposite the Issedones', with the Araxes (i. e. Sir Daria or Jaxartes) between them. H. then is consistent at once with himself and with fact. As Ptolemy, however, puts the Issedones in Central Asia, Tomaschek violently transfers all the tribes far to the east, puts the Argippaei under the Altai, and conjectures that the Hyperboreans are the Chinese (Meyer, iii. 65, accepts generally Tomaschek's views). The muxo/s is the 'recess' into which the Don runs. In c. 57 it is P. Maeotis which divides Scyths and Sauromatae (cf. 117 nn.). From this it is usually concluded (cf. Stein, Macan, in their maps) that H. made the P. Maeotis run due north and south; but this inference is quite needless, and it makes H.'s account of Darius' campaign hopelessly inconsistent (cf. 101. 3 n.) with itself. For the Sauromatae cf. c. 107 n., for the Budini c. 108. 1 n. *qussage/tai. Some connect the names of Thyssagetae and Massagetae, and connect both with the Getae and with the Goths (e. g. Humboldt). But this is guessing. The Thyssagetae and the Iyrkae may perhaps be Finns; they (like the Finns, Tac. Germ. 46) are in the lowest stage of civilization, mere hunters. The name *)\\oaros (c. 123) may well be Finnish 'Rhau' (M\u00fcllenhof, iii. 15-17). There are still Finns (Mordvinians) on the Volga near Samara. a)posta/ntes. These Scyths, if a reality, were more probably a remnant left behind than a revolting tribe. falakroi/. The 'bald' men seem to be a Calmuck tribe; they resemble this race in their flat noses (simoi/) and 'large chins', and in the scantiness of their hair; but Rawlinson denies the resemblance. Bunbury (i. 197) maintains that the shaven sacerdotal caste has been confused with the whole people, and urges their 'sacredness' (\u00a7 5) as a proof of this. Others see in their peacefulness a merchants' truce (so Westberg, u. s.). H. here applies three of the four anthropological criteria of race (cf. viii. 144. 2 n.). The Argippaei are marked off as a distinct people by physical features (i. e. 'descent') and by 'language'; but the evidence of 'custom' is various; while they have a Scyth dress, their food is different from the Scythian, cf. Myres, A. and C. p. 135. The criterion of 'religion' is not used here (contrast viii. 144. 2). a)/sxu. The 'Ponticum' is the wild cherry, the use of which by the Calmucks is exactly described by H.: the very name 'atchi' (= 'acid') survives among the Tartars (Reinach, A. R. M. p. 196). u(po\\ dendre/w|. For a tree used as a tent-pole cf. Tac. Germ. 46. di) e(pta\\ e(rmhne/wn. The 'seven interpreters' are an interesting trace of the old trade-route; H. gives only five tribes, or six with the Geloni (c. 108). For the mixed populations of South-east Europe cf. Pliny's (N. H. vi. 15) story of '130 interpreters' at Dioscurias. e(ca/mhnon. For H.'s scepticism cf. iv. 191 ad fin. The 'six months'' sleep is a confused tradition of the perpetual night of the polar winter. Rawlinson (iii. 207), however, refers it to the severity of a Russian winter, requiring an indoor life for six months. As the mountains 'separate' the 'bald' men from the unknown region, and as they lie to the north of both the 'bald' and the Issedones, who are further east (\u00a7 2), the mountains are conceived as running east and west (cf. 21. 1 n). Rawlinson wrongly puts the 'mountains' between the 'bald' and the Issedones. dai=ta proti/qentai. Among the Indian Callatiae also the dead are eaten (iii. 38. 4); but among the Massagetae (i. 216. 2) and the Indian Padaei (iii. 99. 1) death is anticipated. Possibly the variations of the accounts are due to the fancy of H. (e. g. the grim humour of iii. 99. 1); but we may trace in the custom three different ideas. (1) The desire to partake of the merits of the dead by eating him (cf. Frazer, G. B. ii1. 89), which is prominent in this passage; (2) the desire to give an honourable end (i. 216. 3; iii. 38); (3) the attempt to crush the spirit of decay before it becomes powerful (iii. 99). Of these (1) and (3) are inconsistent, but genuine pieces of savage thought, (2) is perhaps only a Greek explanation of a barbarous custom. For the eating of dead relatives cf. in ancient times Onesicritus (the pilot of Alexander, in Strabo 710; Strabo rejects the story with contempt), as to the tribes of the Caucasus; in mediaeval times, M. Polo (iii. 10; vol. ii, 293, 298) as to Sumatra. In modern times instances are quoted from the neighbourhood of New Guinea (Wallace) and from India. This last is the cannibalism of the Birhors in Chota Nagpore, as late as 1863 (J. A. S. B. xxxiv, pt. ii, p. 18); but Dalton, who originally recorded it, says in his Ethnology of Bengal, p. 220 (1872), 'I have no faith in the story,' i. e. he thinks either he or the natives had misunderstood each other. This self-correction in a trained observer may make us sympathize with mistakes in H., who was not a trained observer. For cannibalism generally cf. Sollas (Anc. Hunt, p. 145); he says that it is often practised simply from a taste for human flesh. kefalh/n. Cf. the treatment of the skulls of enemies by the Scyths (c. 65), and for a similar custom among the Boii, Livy xxiii. 24, among the Lombards, Gibbon, v. 12. gene/sia: the feast of the dead, on the anniversary of death, as opposed to the gene/qlia 'the birthday feast' (Ammonius, de Diff.

Tac. Germ. 46. dusxei/meros. The Greeks naturally, from contrast with their own, exaggerated the terrors of the Pontic winter (cf. our own use of 'Siberian'). Hippocrates (De Aere, 19) makes it worse than H.: 'cold winds always blow from the north from the Rhipaean Mountains; mist thickly covers the plains, so that it is always winter, and the summer lasts but a few days.' qa/lassa. This is especially the case with the 'limans', the estuaries of the rivers; but the sea itself freezes in the Gulf of Odessa during January (Bonmariage, Russie d'Europe, 1903, pp. 125-6); cf. Strabo (307) for the freezing of the Bosporus, and Ovid, Tristia, iii. 10, 31 (of the says that every winter a(maceu/etai o( dia/plous from Panticapaeum to Phanagoria.

The dative with xwri/zw is very unusual; cf. H. as usual is eager to see a contrast; the winter was the wet season elsewhere, the summer in Scythia. This last remark was more true, no doubt, in his day, when the coast strip, the region he knew personally, was well wooded (cf. 'The Woodland', 18. 1 n.); but even now the wettest months are in the summer, and their maximum rainfall is three times as great as the minimum fall, which is in the winter (for tables cf. Bonmariage, u. s. p. 264). h)=mos: i. e. in spring and autumn, when thunderstorms are frequent in Greece. seismo/s. H. is right as to the rarity of earthquakes in South Russia; cf.

The hardihood of the Cossack ponies is well known; in Greece and Asia Minor horses were rare and carefully tended (hence their liability to 'frost-bite'), while the hard work was done by mules and asses.

The fact is right that the South Russian cattle have short horns, but H.'s attempt to give a scientific explanation, though interesting, is refuted by the huge horns of reindeer and elk. H. uses Homer (e. g. Od. iv. 85) as our ancestors used the Bible, to prove everything. (Cf. Introd. p. 21.) prosqh/kas. H.'s artless confession of his tendency to 'digress' is amusing. The fact that mules were not born in Elis is vouched for by Plut. Mor. p. 303 and Paus. v. 5. 2. It was said to be due to the 'curse' of Oenomaus, whose love of horses made him object to cross-breeds. pterw=n. The reference to the heavy snow is another (cf. 25. 1) echo of tradition from the far north. makro/tata, with ta\\ le/getai, 'which are said as to the remotest parts'; for ta\\ makro/tata cf. ii. 32. 3. The sentence sums up briefly what H. had already said in c. 16; the me/n marks the contrast to the Hyperborean story that follows, which is a mere myth. The Hyperboreans. The Hyperboreans were so established in Greek traditional geography that H. feels bound to discuss them; but he argues that the legend as to them is not native but Greek. The earliest mention of them is in the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus (vii. 28-9), dated by Sikes and Allen in the seventh or sixth century B. C., is equivalent to 'the ends of the earth'. We may assume that H. found it used in this sense in 'Hesiod' and in the 'Epigoni', though these works have both perished. If so, the popular etymology of their name, 'those beyond the north wind,' goes back at least to the seventh century. It is difficult therefore to see in them early Greek worshippers of Apollo in Thessaly and other northern parts of Greece (as Farnell, C. G. S. iv. 100 seq.); the first evidence for this view is a fragment of Hecataeus, who seems to identify them with the Locrians (Schol. to Apoll. Rhod. ii. 675). It is supported by the explanation of the name as = u(pe/rforoi (cf. *perfere/es, 33. 3), i. e. the sacred 'carriers' of offerings (cf. c. 33 n.). But it is better to suppose the Hyperboreans an imaginary people, the northern counterpart of the blameless Ethiopians of the south (iii. 17. 1 n.). As geographical knowledge increased, their home was shifted further and further away (for references vid. Farnell, u. s.). Pindar (Ol. iii. 16) puts them on the Danube; then they were associated (by Damastes, a younger contemporary of H., fr. 1, F. H. G. ii. 65) with the imaginary Rhipaean Mountains, from which the north wind blew; Hippocrates (de Aer. 19) and even Aristotle (Meteor. i. 13, 350 b) accept these mountains as a reality. Later we find the Hyperboreans in an island, 'opposite the Celts,' which seems to be Britain (Hec. Abd. fr. 2, F. H. G. ii. 386); and finally, in the eleventh century A. D., they were identified with the Scandinavians. The Hyperboreans were credited with all the virtues, including vegetarianism (just as, even as late as the eighteenth century A. D., Linnaeus thought the Lapps were free from all the vices of civilization and that they lived to be over 100 years old); they were especially connected with the worship of Apollo (c. 33 nn., Pind. Pyth. x. 30, and Bacchyl. iii. 59), and so identified with the Delphians by Mnaseas, a pupil of Eratosthenes (fr. 24, F. H. G. iii. 153). H.'s refutation of the Hyperborean myth may be an attack on Hecataeus; Diodorus (ii. 47) found it in the works bearing his name, especially the story of Abaris (c. 36 n.). It is needless, as is usually done, to refer this passage in Diodorus to Hecataeus of Abdera. doke/w: the argument is, Aristeas might have got his story of the Hyperboreans from the Issedones (13. 1); but this is improbable, as the Scyths know nothing of the Hyperboreans, though they repeat the rest of the Issedones' story (c. 27). The 'Epigoni' was the sequel of the Thebais; Pausanias (ix. 9. 2) ranked it, after the Iliad and the Odyssey, as the best of the Cyclic poems. *dh/lioi. The following points may be noticed in the Delian story: (1) H.'s source is obviously the hymn (35. 1) as well as the temple tradition; he is familiar with the shrine (34. 2, 35. 4), and compares the ritual with what he has seen in Thrace (33. 5). (2) The offerings were wrapped in straw not only as packing material, but to shield their sanctity. No doubt such offerings came to Delos regularly from the states of which it was the religious centre (for Delos cf. vi. 97. 1 n. and Jebb, Essays). (3) With these ritual connexions has been combined the tradition of one of the oldest traderoutes of Europe, the 'Amber route', from the northern end of the Adriatic, near which the Alps are lowest, down the coast, and then from Dodona across to the Malian Gulf. The Greek stages are given carefully, but the northern ones are unknown, and in their place (regardless of geography) are inserted the Hyperboreans, who were far to the north-east, but who were especially connected with Apollo. This route is dated by A. J. Evans (Freeman, Sicily, iv. 220-1) as early as 1,000 B. C.; for a brief account of it cf. Tozer, Geog. pp. 31 seq.; he points out that amber also reached the Mediterranean through Gaul by the Rhone valley, at least as early as the time of Pytheas (fourth century), and possibly even before the foundation of Massilia. (4) The common tendency to duplicate beginnings (cf. the Spartan kings, who are not Eurysthenidae and Proclidae, but Agiadae and Eurypontidae) is clearly seen; probably both pairs of maidens are personified attributes of divinity (v.i.). (5) The tradition is also given in Callimachus (Hymn. Del. 283), who follows H., and in Pausanias (i. 31. 2), who, however, following an Attic tradition (probably dating from the time of Athenian control of Delos), brings the offerings by an eastern route via the Arimaspi, the Issedones, and Sinope to Prasiae in Attica, 'where there is shrine of Apollo'; cf. also Plut. Mor. 1136. *)adri/hn. Probably the road passed Apollonia; for connexion of this with Delphi cf. ix. 93-4. po/lin e)s po/lin: communication by land in early times is always preferred to that by sea; this B\u00e9rard calls 'Loi des Isthmes' (Les Ph\u00e9n. dans well be that the 'sacred way' to Delos lay on both sides of the Euripus, for, beside the Euboic route implied by H., there was a shrine of Apollo at Delium, and his oldest shrine in Attica was in the Marathonian Tetrapolis, which was especially connected with the qewri/a passed over'; Andros was the home of a different cult, that of Dionysus. *(upero/xhn t. k. *l. The names seem epithets of Artemis; cf. Phylacus and Autonous at Delphi, attributes personified of Apollo at Delphi (viii. 39). The 'Perpherees' were obviously officials at Delos. Hesychius explains the name = qewroi/. kei/rontai. Cf. the yearly mourning for Jephthah's daughter, Judges xi. 40. Pausanias (i. 43. 4) calls the maidens *(ekae/rgh and *)wpis, and compares this custom to the dedication at Megara of maiden's hair to Iphinoe. For the dedication of hair before marriage cf. ii. 65. 4 n. and Frazer, Paus. iii. 279; for the same in i. the 'quick delivery' of Latona; Pausanias (i. 18. 5) brings Eileithuia from the Hyperboreans to help Latona. a)gei/rein is especially used of 'gathering sacred gifts' (cf. a)gu/rths), but = 'begging' in general; it is as old as Homer (Od. xvii. 362). Pausanias (ix. 27. 2) makes Olen the oldest of Greek hymn writers, and (x. 5. 4), quoting a Delphic tradition, a Hyperborean. As connected with Apollo, he comes from Lycia. The fact that his hymns were in hexameters dates him about the eighth century, if he be a real person at all. pro\\s h)w=. For variations in burial positions cf. Plut. Sol. 10; the cult here was pre-Ionian, for the Ionians placed their dead facing west (ib.). H. rejects without discussion the story of Abaris (cf. 32 n.), who was made by Pindar (Harpoc. s. v. Abaris) a contemporary of Croesus. Later writers (e.g. Porphyry v. Pythag. 29) made the 'arrow' serve him like a witch's broomstick, on which he sailed through the air over rivers and seas. ei) de/ ei)si. H. sums up his argument against the Hyperboreans with a reductio ad absurdum; symmetry would require us to believe in 'Hypernotians' also; but this is neither asserted (nor possible on account of extreme heat?). Therefore there are no Hyperboreans. Eratosthenes (Strabo 61-2) not unnaturally called H.'s argument 'absurd' It is curious to see H. appealing to the very symmetry which three lines later he denounces. The reference to Hecataeus is clear (cf. c. 32 n.); Aristotle (Meteor. ii. 5, 362 b 12) repeats H. almost verbally here, but gives a different reason for rejecting 'the round world'. gra/yantas, 'drawing' (cf. grafh/ninf.). H. has in his mind some early map (Berger, E. G. p. 36, argues that it is that of Anaximander; cf. v. 49. 1), in which the world was a perfect circle, with a circumambient ocean for its rim, 'as if drawn with a pair of compasses.' Such had been the conception of Hecataeus (cf. ii. 21 n.), who brought the Argonauts from the Phasis via the ocean stream and the Nile back to the Mediterranean (F. H. G. i. 13, fr. 187). ou)de/na . . . e)chghsa/menon, 'explaining world) sensibly,' vid. sup. Hecataeus' fault was double: (a) his worldmap was purely a priori; (b) he made no effort to co-ordinate his mass of geographical details in a rational scheme. There is another protest against symmetry in w(s a)po\\ to/rnou; Europe is far larger than Asia (including Libya) to H. (iv. 42. 1), but the map-makers made them balance equally. H. gives a specimen of what in his opinion geography should be: (1) He describes the distribution of peoples in West Asia (cc. 37-40). He has been criticized for making no reference to the numerous tribes mentioned, iii. 90 seq.; but this would have been quite out of place in a general sketch. (2) He then gives the boundaries of the continents (cc. 41-5), and discusses the division. In this part he gives an account of three great voyages, undertaken to settle definitely the boundaries of Asia and Africa. (For H.'s geography cf. App. XIII.) For the Erythraean Sea cf. i. 1. 1 n.; for the Saspeires, iii. 94. 1 n. The four countries form a line from north to south, which divides, for H., Eastern from Western Asia, and forms the base of both a)ktai/. The Phasis is part of the boundary between Europe and Asia (cf. 45. 2). a)ktai/. The English word most nearly corresponding is 'peninsula', as we use it of Spain or of Scandinavia. Asia Minor really is an a)kth/, especially to H. who thought its eastern boundary much narrower than it actually is (i. 72. 3 n.). But he seems to have conceived (c. 39) of the rest of Western Asia as a similar projection (cf. Bunbury, i. 207). It is easy to see that H. had no accurate maps. *fa/sios. H. obviously put this too far south, in the corner of the Black Sea. The Hellespont here includes all the narrow seas, from the Bosporus to Sigeum, at the entrance of the Hellespont; cf. 95. 1, 138. 2; v. 103. 2; vi. 26. 1, 33. 1; this sense is familiar in the 'Hellespontine' division of the Athenian tribute. In i. 57. 2 and vii. 137. 3 'Hellespont' = 'the Sea of Marmora'. *(ellhspo/ntioi is usually, if not always, used by H. in the wider sense; cf. iii. 90. 2; iv. 89. 2; v. 1. 1; vii. 95. 2. The 'Myriandian Gulf' is the modern Bay of Issus. The 'Triopian Cape' is the south-west corner of Asia Minor, near Cnidus (cf. i. 144. 1). trih/konta. There are thirty-three nations in H.'s two lists together (iii. 90 seq.; vii. 70 seq.), thirty in each of them singly. H. knows nothing of the modern Persian Gulf or of the shape of Arabia. His 'Assyria' consists of the basins of the Euphrates and Tigris below Armenia (i. 178. 1 n.), and his 'Arabia' includes the southern part of the desert as well as Arabia proper. no/mw|. It only ends 'conventionally', because Libya is really a continuation (41. 1).

The words 'in which it ends' are ambiguous as to Egypt, as is also 41. 1. H., however, seems by coupling Egypt with Syria to put them both in Asia; cf. also 41. 1 n. On the other hand, he does not count the Egyptians in this a)kth/ (v. i.); and in 41. 2 he clearly makes Africa begin at the Isthmus of Suez. In ii. 17. 1 he makes the boundaries of Asia and Libya those of Egypt, but does not say to which continent it belongs. On the whole it is more probable that H. gave Egypt to Africa, but many, e.g. Tozer, A. G. p. 82, maintain the contrary; but as he thought Africa a continuation of the a)kth/ of Asia, the exact position of Egypt seemed to him of little importance. tri/a.

The greater knowledge of the moderns reverses his arrangement; Stanford (quoted by Macan) says 'Europe is after all only a peninsula of Asia'. eu)/reos. The continents cannot (H. thinks) be compared, for the northern boundaries of Europe are unknown, and therefore it is far broader, while the southern boundaries of Asia and of Africa had been rounded by Scylax (c. 44) and by the Phoenicians (v. i.). a)pe/pemye. On this famous voyage cf. Bunbury, i. 289 seq., 317 (who leaves the question open), E. J. Webb, E. H. R., Jan. 1907 (strongly adverse), and H. Berger, pp. 62-5, who formerly rejected the story, but now 'reserves a final judgement till circumstances are more favourable'. The arguments for its truth are: (1) The time is adequate. (2) The currents would be favourable all the way, while on the east coast the voyage would be assisted by the north monsoon, and in the west by the south trade-wind. (3) The circumstance disbelieved by H. is a strong confirmation; the sun (not 'the sunrise') in the southern hemisphere would actually be 'on the right', so long as they sailed west, and from the Equator to the Cape of Good Hope the course would be south-west and then west, while on the return journey it would be slightly northwest. (4) The voyage was undertaken for a practical purpose, to facilitate communication between Mediterranean and Red Seas; as its result was useless for this purpose it was forgotten, just as the discovery of America by the Northmen in the eleventh century was forgotten till the nineteenth. On the other hand: (1) Later geographers rejected the story, e.g. Strabo (ib.), Polybius (iii. 37); the last-named doubted if the sea were continuous round Africa, and Aristotle (Meteor. ii. 1, 354 a) also denied its continuity. (2) It is strange that H. tells no stories of the marvels of the South, of the change of seasons, &c. [But this argument is of little value.] (3) The change in the position of the sun was an easy guess for any one who had seen the vertical sun at Syene. (4) Exaggeration was easy; so the voyage of Hanno, who perhaps reached as far as Sierra Leone (Bunbury, i. 318 seq.), is represented by Pliny (ii. 67. 169) as having been extended to Arabia. (But Pliny's inaccurate and contradictory statements are no parallel to H.'s plain and straightforward narrative.) On the whole it seems best to accept the story, as Meyer (iii. 60) unhesitatingly does. In 1906 two scarabs were communicated to the French Academy, which professed to commemorate this circumnavigation; it was soon shown, however, by the Berlin Egyptologists that they were forgeries. th\\n borhi/hn: the Mediterranean; for the 'Pillars' cf. ii. 33. 3 n. H. conceives the mariners as observing the same seasons as at home; there would be two harvests. But if the statement is a fact at all, it is obvious that the sowing would be determined on other grounds than a Mediterranean calendar. Cf. for these harvests on the way, the plans of Eudoxus for the same circumnavigation (Strabo 100). oi( le/gontes, not 'that they had sailed round it', but that 'it could be sailed round' (peri/rrutos 42. 2). Unluckily H. gives no details as to Carthaginian testimony; the voyage of Hanno (v. s.) was probably about fifty years before his birth (cf. vii. 165), but H. never mentions it. The causal connexion is odd: (I mention them) 'because Sataspes failed'. Probably the Zopyrus of iii. 153 seqq., whose grandson deserted to Athens (iii. 160) and may well have told H. this and other stories (cf. J. H. S. xxvii. 37 seq.). H. probably had heard this story also in Samos (\u00a7 7). For the use of criminals for dangerous voyages cf. the English usage from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, e. g. Doyle, English in America, i. 61, 71. For C. Soloeis cf. ii. 32. 4 n. smikrou/s: for the 'dwarfs wearing dresses of palm', ii. 32. 6 n. e)ni/sxesqai. No doubt his vessel was stopped by the south tradewind (v. s.). It may be noted to H.'s credit that he tells us nothing of the 'masses of mud and seaweed' ('Scylax' 112), with which Greek imagination or Carthaginian trade-jealousy blocked the navigation of the Atlantic. e)pilh/qomai: cf. i. 51. 4 for similar forbearance; this chapter is a good instance of the way in which H. pieces together different stories. krokodei/lous. Crocodiles were thought especially to belong to the Nile (cf. Arr. Anab. vi. 1. 2); this is one of the reasons why H. confuses Niger and Nile (ii. 32. 7 n.). *karuande/a. Scylax was a neighbour of H., for Caryanda is an island off Caria. The work which goes by his name is probably of the fourth century, and is almost entirely concerned with the Mediterranean; it says nothing of the Indian Ocean (Bunbury, i. 384 seq.). Aristotle (Pol. vii. 14. 3, 1332 b) quotes Scylax as to the Indians. His voyage may be dated about 509 B. C. Pactyice (with Caspatyrus) is mentioned in iii. 102. 1 as bordering the north of India. Stein identifies it with North-east Afghanistan; the Afghans still call themselves 'Pakhtun' or 'Pashtun' (cf. 'Pathans'); he makes Caspatyrus = Kabul, preferring the form *kaspa/puros (Hec. fr. 179; F. H. G. i. 12); H., he thinks, confuses the Kabul tributary with the Indus main stream, and so makes (wrongly) the Indus 'flow east'; this view is shared by Brunnhofer, Urg. Ari. i. 54. But the Kabul river is unnavigable. Wilson makes *kaspa/turos = city of Casyapa, i. e. Kashmir, which once included much of the Punjaub (Ariana, p. 137); but this seems impossible. Scylax probably started down the Indus from just above Attock, which lies at the junction of the Indus and the Kabul, about 200 miles almost due east of the town of Kabul; H.'s informant confused the main city of the district with the exact starting-point on the Indus. There is no need to doubt this voyage; H. writes of it from contemporary evidence, and his statement is confirmed by the fragments of Darius' inscriptions on his Nile canal (ii. 158. 1 n.). It is to be noted that he tells of no impossibilities, like the later fiction of Patrocles' voyage round into the Caspian (Pliny, N. H. vi. 58). Berger, however (pp.73-5), is very doubtful of the reality of Scylax' voyage because of (1) H.'s mistake as to the course of the Indus (v. i.). (2) His ignorance of the Persian Gulf; a coasting voyage up this would have brought Scylax nearly to Susa, whence a new voyage was necessary to bring him to the Red Sea. H. makes it only one voyage. [But probably Scylax never went into the Persian Gulf at all; his coasting voyage would bring him to a Persian port at the Isle of Ormuz, thence he would sail across the Straits of Ormuz and resume his voyage to the south and west. This course is so obvious that it was not definitely recorded.] (3) Arrian (Ind. 19 seq., Anab. vii. 20) knows nothing of the voyage of Scylax [but Posidonius (Strabo 100) believed in it], and tells us Alexander's seamen failed to get round into the Red Sea. Myres (G. J., 1896, 623) conjectures the 'Indian river' to be the Ganges, and that 'an expedition . . . doubled C. Comorin, a voyage for which thirty months is not too long, though it is too long for a journey home from the mouth of the Indus'. For the conquest of the Indians cf. iii. 94. 2 n. o(/moia. The south of Asia like the south of Africa has been explored, unlike Europe (45. 1); the two voyages correspond; one takes more than two years (42. 4), the other 'thirty months'. The anacoluthon parexome/nh is noticeable. For the ignorance of Europe cf. iii. 115. 1 n., for its 'length' 42. 1 n. ou)no/mata trifa/sia. For the continents cf. App. XIII. 5; there seems a trace of Greek contempt for women here and elsewhere in this chapter (e.g. ei) mh\\ a)po\\ th=s *turi/hs (\u00a7 4)), which makes it clear how completely the real meanings of 'Asia' and 'Europe' were forgotten in H.'s time. 'Asia' is first used in Pindar (Ol. vii. 34), but the adjective in the well-known also the name of two Trojans. 'Europe' occurs first in Hymn to Apollo, 250-1 (cf. 290-1), where it is used of the Greek mainland, as opposed to Peloponnese and the 'seagirt islands'. The names seem to be derived from the Assyrian, 'a\u00e7u' and 'irib' (perhaps cf. e)/rebos), i. e. the 'rising' and the 'setting', and no doubt reached the Greeks through the Lydian traders (cf. \u00a7 3); we may perhaps compare the Assyrian names among the early Lydian kings (i. 7. 2 nn.). No doubt 'Asia' and 'Europe' were first used of the opposite shores of the Aegean, and gradually extended, with the spread of geographical knowledge, to their respective hinterlands (cf. Kiepert, Anc. Geog. i. 17, E. T.). ou)ri/smata. H. is here giving the ordinary 'boundaries' which he does not accept (ii. 16, 17 nn.). oi( de/: making the boundary run north and south.

For Europa cf. i. 2. 1; she came 'to Lycia from Crete' with her son Sarpedon. nomizome/noisi. The threefold division was already 'established' and H. therefore follows it, in spite of what he thinks to be its absurdities. H. seems about to begin the story of Darius' campaign, but the mention of the nomadic habits of the Scyths leads to a further digression on the great rivers, in which feature, so favourable to commerce, H., like a true Greek, is especially interested (cf. c. 82 for his emphasis on their importance), all the more so because Greece had no such rivers. It may be noted generally that (1) H. is fairly accurate as to the lower courses of the rivers as far as the Dnieper, but that beyond the Dnieper his account is unrecognizable and full of difficulties. (2) That with regard to their sources, he ignores the fabled Rhipaean Mountains, which even Aristotle (Meteor. i. 13, 350 b) made the source of the Russian rivers (cf. 32 nn.); but his lakes, from which he derives six of his rivers, are equally theoretical (57. 2 n.). The revers really rise in great swamps; but probably in H.'s days these may have been more like shallow lakes. Cf. Krapotkin, Geog. Journ. xxiii. 725. R\u00e9clus (v. 284-5) describes the shrinking of the water-area: except the rivers of Finland, all the great watercourses of Russia have 'vid\u00e9 les et constitu\u00e9 fluviale'; but this process begun with 'the disappearance of the Ice Age'. a)maqe/stata. H. rejects the 'noble savage' theory which the Greeks tended to hold about the peoples of the North (cf. 2. 1 n.). The exception made by H. in favour of the Scyths is due to Anacharsis (c. 76), and is tacitly contradicted by Thucydides (ii. 97. 6). e)nto/s: not 'west of' (Stein) but 'in the region of'.

Polo, i. 52, says of the Tartars: 'Their houses are circular, and made of wands covered with felts; these are carried with them whithersoever they go'; for pictures of the Tartar houses cf. ib. pp. 253-5. Hippocrates goes on to describe the Scyth diet as flesh, milk, and cheese. H. skilfully introduces here the main point of his account of the campaign (cf. c. 120). eu)/udros.

So far H.'s geography has been near the truth; now it becomes impossible. He knows nothing of the mountain block of central Europe, though its name and that of the 'Carpathians' make their first appearance in geography as the rivers Alpis and Carpis. Perhaps the direction of these rivers is a confused tradition of the Drave and Save, or even of the Inn. Cf. ii. 33. 3 nn. for the Celts and the Cynetes. pla/gia.

B.9 xxi. 15), but snow is comparatively rare, 'only twelve days in the year.' Here, as in his account of the Nile flood (cf. ii. 24 nn.), he greatly exaggerates the effects of evaporation. The absence of floods on the Lower Danube is a fact, but the real cause is the Iron Gates near Belgrade, which were unknown to H.; these hold up the water, acting like a great natural lock; hence the floods are in Hungary (which was outside H.'s sphere of knowledge), not in the Danubian principalities.

Dio Chrys. (Or. xxxvi. p. 48) mentions the salt in the second century A. D., and Kinburn (on the Dnieper liman) still supplies South Russia.

Athenaeus (118 d) mentions the ta/rixos a)ntakai=on ('caviare'), but without to Olbia. *ge/rrou. The 'limit' of Scythia (71. 3); hence some have proposed to alter 'forty' into 'fourteen', because Scythia is only 'twenty days' journey' across (101. 3). But 'Scymnus' (l. 817; G. G. M. i. 230) in the first century B. C. says the Borysthenes is navigable for 'forty days' but no more, and Stein points out that H. is speaking of a voyage, and so the calculation takes into account the windings of the stream; the number therefore may be explained by the great east bend of the Dnieper. But though H.'s informants may have known of this, he himself certainly did not, for he thinks the Dnieper 'flows from the north'; Stein explains this of its course just at Gerrhi, and points out that the Dnieper does flow from north to south as far as Kief, and then south-east by east; but H. says it flows from the north all the way from Gerrhi. It is curious too that he knows nothing of the rapids of the Dnieper, which begin at Ekaterinoslav, 260 miles from its mouth; had he known of them, he must have compared them with the Nile cataracts. H. faithfully reproduces his sources, but his own knowledge of the river is limited to what could be gained on the voyage, up or down it, to Exampaeus. He shines, however, by comparison with Strabo (306), who says the Dnieper is only navigable for 600 stades! de/ka: cf. 18. 2 n. e(/los. The great liman of the Dnieper (cf. 17. 1 n.) is only six feet deep in summer, hence the name e(/los. e)/mbolon. Dio Chrysostom (Or. xxxvi. p. 48), an eyewitness, repeats this comparison, which may refer to Cape Stanislav, half-way between the mouths of the two rivers. He is the only author besides H. in whom the name Hippolaus appears; no doubt the early Greek settlers invented a 'horse' hero to suit the native habits. i(ro\\n *dh/mhtros. Demeter's head is the principal type on the Olbian coins (cf. Head, H. N. 272). There is a v. l.mhtro/s, i. e. 'of Cybele'; one coin gives a head with a mural crown, the mark of Cybele; but even this head has a wreath of corn also, so that it might be that of Demeter. The Panticapes, Hypacyris, and Gerrhus defy identification, while the last-named presents special difficulties (c. 56 n.). To suppose great physical changes (with Rawlinson ad. loc. and in his map) is not probable; the only safe inference is that merchants crossed three rivers on their journey north-east, between Dnieper and Don. a)po/, 'as to'; cf. a Homeric usage. Panticapaeum on the Cimmerian Bosporus has nothing to do with this Panticapes, though the names may be both connected with po/ntos; cf. iii. 92 *panti/maqoi. For Carcinitis cf. 99. 2. H. does n\u00f2t describe the well-known 'course of Achilles', a long sandy strip running parallel to the shore for eighty miles, but joined to it only in one place (cf. Strabo 307); the western half is called Tendra. Achilles was specially honoured in the G. 2076, 2077). a)pe/sxistai. Bunbury (i. 212) denies the possibility of the Gerrhus thus leaving the Dnieper forty days' journey from its mouth (cf. 53. 4) and taking an independent course; but there is a sort of parallel in the Cassiquiare in South America, which has a continuous course from the Orinoco to the Rio Negro, a tributary of the Amazon (V. de St. Martin, Dict. de G\u00e9og.). It is impossible, however, to fit the Gerrhus into South Russia. Stein ingeniously suggests that its name meant 'boundary' (cf. 71. 3), and that it represents the frontier line of the Royal Scyths, which is supposed to be one continuous river. The Tanais is of course the Don; H. has once more trustworthy information, no doubt derived from the 'emporium called Cremni' (20. 1). The Tanais flows from a small lake; it is more probable, however, that H.'s 'great lake' is due to a general theory of lake origin (46 n.) than to definite information. The Hyrgis is probably the Donetz; in 123. 3 it is called Syrgis, and runs direct into the Palus Maeotis. e)pixolwta/th. Theophrastus (Hist. Plant. ix. 17) seems to be contradicting this when he says that the Pontic cattle ate and flourished on wormwood, being especially free from 'bile'. H. now describes the religion and manners of the Scyths. This is one of the most valuable parts of his work. *(isti/hn. For the pre-eminence of Hestia cf. 68. 2; 127. 4; for a Scyth picture of her with the sacred fire cf. Reinach, A. R. M. p. 179. Rawlinson considers the worship to be elemental; this is slightly confirmed by C. I. G. iii. 6013 (found in Rome) where Apollo Oetosyrus is identified with the sun-god, Mithra. Nymphodorus (third century B. C., fr. 14; F. H. G. ii. 379) definitely says the Sauromatae were fire-worshippers; cf. also i. 216. 4 (the Massagetae). H. gives no native names for Heracles, who may be a Greek addition, or for Ares. For Aphrodite cf. i. 105. 2 n. 'Artimpasa' is found on two dedications at Tusculum (C. I.

(2) Unlike the Jews, to keep the blood in the victim; for this Reinach (A. R. M. p. 181) compares the sacrificial methods of certain tribes in the Altai Mountains. The flesh was mainly eaten by the sacrificer (61. 2). H. as usual notes the contrast to Greek ritual; there was no 'burning' of the hair (a)nakau/sas) as a 'dedication' (katarca/menos, ii. 45. 1), (e)pispei/sas). For the tmesis peri\\ w)=n e)/bale cf. i. 194. 4 n. *lesbi/oisi krhth=rsi. We know no more of the 'Lesbian bowls' than of the 'Argive' (152. 4); the terms may be commercial ones and so familiar to H. u(pokai/ousi. For using bones as fuel cf. Ezek. xxiv. 5 and Hooker, Journal of a Naturalist (1854), i. 213 (the bones of the Yak in Nepaul). The scarcity of fuel is correct; dung is still dried and burned in South Russia.

The organization thus hinted at is clearly military as well as religious. fa/keloi. These 'bundles of firewood' in a woodless country are, to say the least, exaggerated.

For blood drinking in order to obtain the strength of the dead cf. 26. 1 n. and Denny's Folk Lore of China, p. 67: (The Chinese) 'eat a portion of the victim, especially the heart', to 'acquire the valour with which he was endowed'. In the Seven Years' War contemporaries attribute to the Kirghiz in the Russian army the practice of drinking the blood of those they killed (M. Polo, i. 313). xlai/nas: cf. Carlyle's story (Fr.

For the blood covenant cf. iii. 8. 1 n.; there is an interesting picture of it on a gold plaque from Kouloba (v. i.). These chapters deserve careful study, as evidence of H.'s accuracy and of his wide interest. They are admirable illustrations of the belief that the future life is a continuation of the present, in which the dead needs all he needed here (cf. Tylor, P. C. i. 459 seq.). Moreover, they illustrate the belief that inanimate objects also have spirits, which survive in another world. These beliefs, which are the cause why so many of the treasures of our museums are derived from ancient burial-places, prevailed both in Mycenaean and in the Christian era; cf. Lucian de Luctu, instance in H. cf. v. 92. h 2, 3\u2014the story of Melissa; cf. also v. 8. Caesar (B. G. vi. 19, \u00a7 4) describes the usage in a modified form in the Gaul of his day. For the description of the tomb of Kouloba near Kertch (opened 1831) cf. Rawlinson or (his source) Dubois de Mont\u00e9reux, Voyage autour du Caucase (1838-43), v. 194 seq., and plates, fourth series, 18-25; almost all Rawlinson's illustrations for H. iv. 1-144 come from this splendid work. The tomb in question probably belongs to the fourth century B. C., and is that of one of the Leuconidae, who ruled in Panticapaeum from 437 B. C. For the tumuli generally of South Russia cf. S. Reinach, Introduction, Antiq. du Bosph. Cimm\u00e9r. (1892). The wealth they have yielded is in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg, where the two rooms (vii and x) of 'Kertch' and 'Scythic and Siberian Antiquities' have over 20,000 gold objects, 'a collection unique at once for intrinsic value and for historic interest.' The following points may be specially noted in c. 71. (1) It was belief in H.'s veracity that led to the examination of the tumulus. (2) As a rule the details minutely correspond, but (a) other metals beside gold were found in the tomb. This discrepancy may be due to exaggeration on his part (or his informant's) or to the fact that the tombs explored are later than his time; (b) the number of victims is two (not six). (3) The vault is of stone; of this H. says nothing, though it perhaps implied the xw=ma me/ga of \u00a7 5. The sarcophagus itself was of wood (as in \u00a7 4). (4) Naturally no parallel has been found to the fifty dead mounted slaves (c. 72); these were outside the tomb. But a similar custom of impaling sacrificed animals on wooden beams is found among the tribes of the Altai Mountains (Reinach, A. R. M. p. 181). e)s o(\\ . . . prosplwto/s looks like a gloss due to a misunderstanding of 53. 4. It does not contradict that chapter, but it does contradict the geographical facts. komi/zousi.

M. Polo (i. 51) describes how the bodies of the Great Khans were all buried near a 'mountain called Altai' (which is not the Altai Mountains), even if they are 100 days' journey away. The convoy of the funeral killed all they met, saying, 'go wait upon your lord in the other world.' The Khan's horses too were killed (cf. c. 72). qerapo/ntwn. For human sacrifices at a chief's burial among Caribs, in New Guinea and elsewhere cf. Tylor, P. C. i. 486. i(/ppous. For killing horses for a dead master cf. Tac.

Egyptian ladies still rub their hands with melted frankincense; but neither the 'cedar' nor the 'frankincense tree' grow in South Russia. mh/te: on account of the idea of prohibition in feu/gousi. Anacharsis is killed by the father of Idanthyrsus, who is king (c. 120) circ. 512 B. C.; H. puts his death in the middle of the sixth century; there is therefore nothing impossible in the story (which is very late) that he was a friend of Solon. He was reckoned among the 'Seven Sages' and credited with inventing the potter's wheel, which Strabo (303) rightly says is absurd. The figure of this travelled half-caste\u2014his mother was a Greek (Diog. Laert. i. 101)\u2014in the sixth century B. C. is very interesting. The 'noble savage' theory of Rousseau gave him a new lease of fame in the eighteenth century (cf. 'Anacharsis' Klootz, Carlyle, F. R. passim, and the once famous Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis by Barth\u00e9lemy, 1788). Cyzicus was famous for the worship of Cybele which was said to have been introduced by the Argonauts. *)axillh/ion. H. perhaps gives this description here, not in c. 18 or in c. 55, where it would seem to us more natural, because it suits his account of the secret rite. e)kdhsa/menos, 'hanging from himself.' The a)ga/lmata are small figures of the goddess and of Atys worn on the breast (hence called prosthqi/dia); cf. Polyb. xxi. 31 for their use by the Galli of Pessinus. Tymnes is one of the informants H. mentions by name (Intr. \u00a7 22); he seems to have been a Carian half-breed (cf. v. 37. 1). No doubt he was 'agent' for the Scythian king in the factory at Olbia. His origin and position are significant as to the nature of H.'s sources. H.'s semi-personal (i)/stw) address to Anacharsis is very a)sxo/lous, 'too busy to attend to any wisdom.' 'Laconic' utterances (for which cf. Plut. Mor.) are attributed to Anacharsis himself (cf. Diog. Laer. i. 103 seq.), e. g. that 'sailors were only four digits away from death'. The d' w)=n implies that, while H. considers the praise of the Lacedaemonians to be 'an idle Greek fiction', he knows for certain that Anacharsis died as a Philhellene. For Istria cf. ii. 33-44. pare/labe. For succeeding to harem and throne together cf. 2 Sam. xvi. 21, and M.

The Scythian king clearly had some authority in Olbia, though not as much as the Leuconidae later (438-304 B. C.) had in Panticapaeum and Theodosia, where they bore the title of a)/rxwn; their heads appear on the coins of Panticapaeum. There is no parallel to this in Olbia. *skuqikg/n. Trousers and a sort of peaked cap were the main features; H. does not describe it, as it was not especially Scyth; cf. 23. 2, 106. 1. For a picture of it cf. Sacouca the Sacian on the B. I. e)s au)ta/ 'he brought a wife to it'; cf. our 'to marry into' and Liv. i. 34. 4 quo innupsisset. *bakxei/w| emphasizes the orgiastic character of the rites sfi/gges. For sphinxes cf. ii. 175. 1 n., for griffins c. 13 n. Macan has a long and interesting note on these creatures, which were intended to protect the palace against evil spirits. Perhaps there is a reference in them to Skyles' devotion to Dionysus, for the sphinx appears on the coins of Chios (Head, H. N. p. 599), and the griffin on those of Teos and Abdera (ib. 595, 253), in both cases in connexion with the cult of the wine-god. Griffins are often found ornamenting Scythian objects. dieprh/steuse, 'gibed at'; Stein says the word is colloquial Teres was the father of Sitalces and the founder of the Odrysian power (Thuc. ii. 29). As Sitalces is mentioned below without any comment, Blakesley argues this chapter was written after he had become known at Athens by his capture of the Lacedaemonians' envoys (vii. 137. 3). It certainly reads like a later addition. The events referred to must have happened soon after the accession of Sitalces, which is dated circ. 450 B. C. w(s *s. ei)=nai, 'so far as they are Scyths.' H. distinguishes them from the other races whom the Greeks called 'Scyths'; it was Thucydides' ignorance, or neglect, of this distinction which led him implicitly to contradict H. as to their numbers (cf. v. 3 with Thuc. ii. 97. 6). For Exampaeus cf. 52. 3 n. and Introd. pp. 18, 19. Macan argues that a)pe/fainon means 'offered to show me', and that H. never was at Exampaeus; but this translation is forced, and there is no reason to doubt H. had seen the bowl he describes in such detail; his explanation of its origin, however, is a mere legend. a)ne/qhke. Nymphis (a historian of the third century, fr. 15; F. H. G. iii. 15) says that the bowl (e)pi\\ sto/mati tou= *po/ntou) was there before Pausanias, and that he only put his name on it. This story may be an invention suggested by Thuc. i. 132. 2 (but cf. i. 51. 4 for a similar Lacedaemonian appropriation). It is odd that H. does not mention here the great bowl at Delphi (i. 51. 2), which was of the same size (i. e. holding over 5,000 gallons). For a curiously similar story of a primitive census cf. Wallace, Malay Archipelago (ed. 1869), i. 182-4. i)/xnos *(hrakle/os. Such 'footprints' are common in many countries; cf. Buddha's (which is over five feet by two feet) at Adam's Peak in Ceylon. 'Two cubits' was the proper size for a Greek hero (cf. 2. 91. 3 n. of Perseus). H. now resumes his history from c. I, but at once turns aside to describe the Pontus (cc. 85-6), and later on the geography and races of Scythia (cc. 99-117). Artabanus plays the part of Cassandra here as in vii. cc. 10, 49, while Oeobazus (c. 84) anticipates the misfortunes of Pythius (vii. 39); but H. skilfully touches here only on the points which he works out dramatically in his main narrative. a)pori/hn: cf. i. 71. 2 for a similar argument for non-aggression. Chalcedon lay on the Asiatic side of the Bosporus, at its southwest end. The Cyanean Rocks were the gate of the Pontus (cf. their place in the 'Peace of Callias', vii. 151. n.). Their name, 'the rocks of gloom,' marks the early feeling of the Greeks towards the 'inhospitable' Pontus, while H.'s enthusiasm for the sea corresponds to the later name 'Euxine'. They are called 'wandering' as early as Homer (Od. xii. 61). For their story cf. Pind. Pyth. 4. 371 and Apol. Rhod. ii. 318 (or Morris, Life and Death of Jason, Bk. VI); H. doubts its truth. There are twelve rocks, the largest of which is still called 'Kyani'; they lie off the lighthouse on the extreme point of the European shore (Murray). to\\ mh=kos. H.'s measurements in this chapter are (in stades): Length. Breadth. Pontus 11,100 3,300 (th=| eu)ru/tatos Bosporus 120 4 Propontis 1,400 500 Hellespont 400 7 H. is strangely wrong on the length of the Black Sea; the E. B.9 gives it as 720 miles, i. e. about 6,280 stades; but this is at the longest part, from the Gulf of Burghaz to near Bat\u00fbm. At the point measured by H. (86. 4) it is only about 650 miles. Various explanations are given of his mistake: (1) Rawlinson thinks H. is calculating from his own experience, i. e. he took nine days and eight nights for a coasting voyage along the south of the Black Sea, and was told that his vessel made 1,300 stades a day; but this explanation will not do, for H. is clearly speaking of a direct voyage. Strabo (548) reckons such a coasting voyage in the Euxine at 'about 8,000 stades' only. (2) Others think that a 'long day's' journey (86. 1) was really one of twenty-four hours (as modern ships reckon their 'runs'); H., forgetting this, reckons in the 'nights' over again. (3) The probable explanation, however, is much simpler. H. reckons a 'long day' and a long night; but it is obvious that in the same twenty-four hours a 'long day' presupposes a short night; hence the figure '600 stades' for the night is exaggerated. A normal twenty-four hours' run was 1,000 stades. For the whole subject of a ship's speed cf. vii. 183. 3 nn. It may be noted that the famous Massiliot navigator, Pytheas, made the south coast of Britain nearly twice its real length. eu)=ros. The E. B.9 gives the breadth of the Pontus as 380 miles (about 3,310 stades), but this is in the wide west part. At the points further east measured by H., it is only about '270 miles' (ib. = 2,350 stades). H. therefore is here again in excess, but much less so than as to the length; in the shorter voyage there was less room for miscalculation. te/sseres sta/dioi. The estimates for the breadth of the Bosporus at its narrowest part, which is about the centre (where the bridge was made, 87. 2), vary from 550 metres (about 600 yards; R\u00e9clus) to three-quarters of a mile (E. B.9): Murray's Guide agrees with H. (as does Strabo 125), giving 810 yards. mh=kos. As the whole channel is meant, o( au)xh/n is added to explain. H. underestimates the length, which is about 20 miles (E. B.9), i. e. 175 stades. Perhaps in estimating the speed of a vessel sailing down the straits, he forgot to allow for the current. *proponti/s. H. does not tell us at what points he measured the Propontis; the E. B.9 (s. v. Black Sea) gives it 110 and 43 geographical miles (i. e. about 1,100 and 430 stades). H. therefore is too large here also. *(ellh/sponton. H.'s breadth for the Hellespont agrees with Murray's, who gives 1,400 yards; but Murray makes the length 33 miles, i. e. about 290 stades. Rawlinson (ad loc.) has a useful table of the measurements of H., Strabo, and Pliny, compared with actual distances. He notes (1) that H.'s successors are hardly more accurate; (2) that as a rule his measurements are in excess, because he overestimates the speed of vessels; (3) that, as might be expected, he is most inaccurate as to the part most remote, i. e. the Pontus. nhu=s. H. does not mean that he is giving the results of his own voyage; he is calculating from a seaman's peri/plous (for these cf. B\u00e9rard, ii. 544 f.). For Sindice cf. 28. 1 n. makro/taton. H. is not familiar with the western curve of the Pontus (v. s.). h(\\ *maih=tis. The real size of the Sea of Azov is 235 miles by 110 (E. B.9s. v. 'Azof'): Scylax (Per. 69) makes it half the size of the Pontus, Strabo (125) rather more than a third. Rawlinson thinks the sea was once much larger than it is now (cf. Polyb. iv. 40, who says that it was gradually being silted up). mh/thr. H. is perhaps misled by supposed etymology from mai=a; the native name of the sea was 'Temarunda' = mater maris (Plin. N. H. vi. 20); cf. 52. 1 for this name. The people on its shores are *mai+/tai in the inscriptions (Dittenb. Sylloge, i. 130, 132, H. uses 'Assyrian' (*)assu/ria) for any cuneiform writing (here for Persian), which of course he could not read.

For the lists of subject races cf. App. VII. 1. e)chriqmh/qhsan. The figure 700,000 was a conventional one for the levy en masse of Persia (cf. Isoc. Panath. 49 for the soldiers in Xerxes' army), as is the number '600' for a Persian fleet; cf. vi. 9 (Lade), 95 (Marathon); '700,000' is of course impossible (cf. Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 294 seq. for the whole subject). sth/lh|si. Ctesias (xvii, p. 68) calls them bwmo/n, and attributes the destruction to the Chalcedonians; but H. speaks as an eyewitness. Artemis Orthia or Orthosia (by some identified with the Tauric Artemis; cf. 103. 1 n.) was worshipped especially at Sparta, where boys, as is well known, were flogged at her altar (discovered in 1906; B. S. A. xii. 331 seq.); perhaps this cruelty was a Spartan peculiarity. The oldest certain mention of her cult is Pind. Ol. 3. 30, but Bergk conjectures *)orqi/a in Alcman P. L. G. iii. 41; for it cf. Paus. iii. 16. 7, and Frazer ad loc., and Farnell C. G. S. ii. 452 seq. The title may be explained with the Schol. to Pind. as o)rqou=sa ta\\s gunai=kas, i. e. in travail; others connect it with the stiff straightness of an early co/anon; but this was not peculiar to Artemis. i(rou=. There was a temple on each side, these being twenty stadia apart (Strabo 319); the Asiatic one (to Zeus *ou)/rios) was the more important (cf. Polyb. iv. 39, where there is a most interesting account of the Pontus). pa=si de/ka is not literal but an idiom for abundance; cf. ix. 81 and the stronger expression mupi/a ta\\ pa/nta, iii. 74. 2. zw=|a, 'figures' of all kinds; cf. i. 70. 1 n.

It is most unlikely that the whole fleet was led by Greeks, though this is required by the story. Duncker (vi. 266, 271) thinks the Phoenician fleet was being used against Libya. au)xe/na. The single stream is called 'neck' in contrast to the space enclosed by the spreading mouths. Strabo (305) says Darius crossed at the lower part of the island Peuce, 120 stades from the southern mouth of the Danube; this seems to have been also the place where Alexander crossed (Arr. Anab. i. 3.). This is placed by Gen. Jochmus (J. R. G. S. xxiv. (1854) pp. 36 seq.) at Isakcha (or Isakdje), about twenty-five miles west of Ismail. He (p. 83) points out that Darius (like the Russians in 1828) was reducing the 'sea towns' as a preliminary; his line of march was close to the sea (p. 47), where the Balkan passes are easiest. H. never mentions these, though he knows of the Haemus elsewhere (49. 1 n.). *te/aros. The river is identified (ib. pp. 44-5) as the confluence of the Bunardere and the Simerdere, in the latter part of which names 'Tearus' survives. Its 'thirty-eight streams' may roughly be made out, and their temperature varies, as H. describes; but they have lost their therapeutic reputation for 'the scab'. An inscription (91. 1) in cuneiform letters seems undoubtedly to have existed here till about 1830, but it has since perished (ib. p. 44). o(do\\s d' e)p' au)ta/s. The source of the Tearus is fully fifty miles from Perinthus as the crow flies, and more from Apollonia. *)agria/nhn. The name of the Agrianes survives in the Erkene, which runs into the Hebrus, i. e. the Maritza. a)/riston. Jochmus (p. 44) says the river deserves the reputation which H. gives it; but the inscription is very Greek in its antithesis. h)pei/rou: i. e. Asia; cf. i. 96. 1. The Odrysians (cf. Thuc. ii. 96) lived in the valley of the Hebrus; the Artiscus is the 'believe in immortality', living between the Balkans and the Danube, occur here for the first time in history. They are not to be confused with the Goths (as Rawlinson and Hodgkin, Invaders of Italy, i. 62). They were later driven north across the Danube into what was afterwards Dacia. Cf. v. 4 n. for their belief in immortality. Salmydessus was notorious for its organized wrecking; cf. Xen. Anab. vii. 5. 12-13. H. describes the position of Thracian tribes by their relation to Greek colonies. Mesambria (vi. 33. 2) received additional settlers after the Ionic revolt. dikaio/tatoi. Cf. 2. 1 n. for this ideal picture. Pomponius Mela (i. 18) calls them ad mortem paratissimi, and connects this courage with their belief in immortality. dai/mona. H., though he obviously suspects them, so far regards his countrymen's stories as to call Salmoxis dai/mwn, not qeo/s: that Salmoxis was a Thracian god there can be no doubt; for the form of the name cf. Salmydessus; Plato (Charm. 158 B) mentions him with Abaris as a master of 'incantations'. The rationalizing story of c. 95 is told with variations by Strabo (297-8) and other later Greek writers without a word of question; Diodorus (i. 94) couples Salmoxis with Zoroaster and Moses as a legislator claiming divine sanction; Origen makes Salmoxis teach the Celtic Druids. H.'s better-informed caution, in contrast to all this, is greatly to his credit. Some moderns, however, accept the Greek story, e. g. Creuzer, Comm. H. p. 171 n., who makes Salmoxis the introducer of 'mysteries' into Thrace, which are celebrated underground. His name, Gebeleizis, remains a puzzle; one commentator makes it 'giver of rest'; another even connects it with *beelzebou/l! For this method of communicating with the unseen cf. Dahomey, where as many as 500 messengers were dispatched a year, A. B. Ellis, Ewe Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of Africa (1890), p. 137. i(/leos.

There is a clear note of irony in the way in which H. tells the Greek story; cf. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, especially pandokeu/onta: no unfavourable judgement on Pythagoras is implied (cf. ii. 123 n.), but H. dislikes the arrogance of his countrymen, introducing themselves into barbarian cults and legends (cf. ii. 45 n.). w(s teqnew=ta. Cf. Soph. El. 62 for a reference to this trick th\\n sxedi/hn lu/santas. This proposal, to cut communications so as to render return by the Caucasus necessary, is only the first of the difficulties of the narrative (for these cf. App. XII). Coes, in v. 37. 1, is tyrant, no doubt as the reward for some service at this time (cf. \u00a7 6). ou)/te a)rhrome/non. This is true in the main, although some of the Scyths grew corn (c. 18), and there were many Greek cities on the coast. a(/mmata. For this 'palpable arithmetic' as a primitive method of reckoning cf. Tylor, P. C. i. 240 seq.; but it is curiously out of place in Darius, who had the learning of Chaldaea at his service. H. gives a sketch of Scythia, which he makes a square of 4,000 stades (c. 101), and of the neighbouring nations (cc. 102-17), which cannot be reconciled on many points (e. g. cf. 101. 2 and 19. 1 n. with cc. 16-20. The rivers are ignored in it, as in the story of the campaign that follows. Macan (ii. 19) ingeniously suggests that this may be an 'ideal scheme of Scythian geography, intended to serve as a complement to the historical narrative', but his further suggestion that it is part of the original draft of the Scythian lo/goi composed before H. had obtained his fuller and later information, is very doubtful. Stein thinks it was accompanied by a map (which is most unlikely). H. starts from the Ister, assumed as the western boundary. He first gives the southern boundary (\u00a7 2); the rest of the chapter is a digression on the Tauric Chersonese. In 100. 1 he gives the eastern boundary, and (\u00a7 2) completes the square with the northern boundary. *skuqikh=s gh=s. H. means that the coast of Scythia does not continue (in a straight line that of Thrace), but that 'as there is a sweep made' (ko/lpou) the Thracian coast line 'projects' (pro/keitai), just as Egypt projects (ii. 12. 1) beyond the line of North Africa. e)kdidoi=, 'runs out' into it; i. e. has its mouth in it (cf. 49. 3 n.). The lower course of the Ister is one of the most difficult points in Herodotean geography. As Niebuhr pointed out (K. S. pp. 156, 356, and map), H. conceives it as running due south (cf. Macan, vol. ii, Map, and p. 18). Niebuhr's arguments are: (1) The supposed correspondence of Ister and Nile (ii. 33. 2 n.). (2) In v. 9 the land to the north of the Ister is not Scythia or that of the Agathyrsi but 'desert', and (v. 10, by implication) u(po\\ th\\n a)/rkton. (3) Only in this way can be explained the great extent of the Thracians (v. 3). (4) The western boundary of Scythia (i. e. admittedly the Danube) runs at a right angle to the coast (101. 3). The last point seems decisive. Rawlinson says rightly that this view, viz. that the lower Danube runs south, is inconsistent with other parts of H., e. g. (1) the Danube receives from Scythia five tributaries, each west of the other (c. 49); the boundary therefore runs east and west, and not north and south; (2) the tributaries from the Haemus flow in from the south (c. 50), so the Danube must run east and west; (3) it runs into the sea 'with its mouth facing south-east' (eu)=ron). But (1) and (2) only prove either that H. did not know these facts when he wrote c. 101, or, more probably, that he forgot them from a love of symmetry; and if the emphasis be laid on sto/ma (\u00a7 1), is rather for the south course than against it. Why mention the 'mouth', if the whole course were south-east? Macan well suggests that H.'s mistake is helped by his confusing the Danube and the Pruth, which latter river flows mainly north and south. land. a)rxai/h. Stein translates 'Scythia proper'; but if so, what was 'new Scythia'? Probably Western Scythia, which was agricultural (c. 17), is meant (Macan); this would have been the part which the Greeks knew first. me/xri . . . *karkini/tidos. Carcinitis is the city on the north-west edge of the Tauric peninsula. The gulf on which it stands really runs east and west; but H. thought it ran north and south (as Strabo 308 also implies). H. was quite ignorant of the real shape of the Crimea, which he conceives of as resembling Attica, i. e. as a triangular projection of Scythia, running south-east (\u00a7 4). Strabo (308) was the first to call it *xerro/nhsos. th\\n au)th/n: i. e. the Pontus. o)reinh/n. Only the south coast of the Crimea is really mountainous. xersonh/sou: that of Kertsch, which H. rightly says runs east. e)/sti ga\\r th=s *skuqikh=s. This does not mean that Scythia is washed on one side by the Black Sea, on the other by the Palus Maeotis (as is often held, e. g. by Macan, ii. 17); but that its projection, the Tauric peninsula, has sea both on south and east. This is rendered probable by the words kata/ per th=s *)attikh=s, and proved by the fact that H. always calls the P. Maeotis li/mnh (100. 1 n.), notqa/lassa. gouno/n, 'high ground'; H.

This passage not only illustrates H.'s geographical inaccuracy, but also the way in which his work was written; the comparison of Iapygia looks like an afterthought, and must have been added after H.'s visit to the west (cf. Introd. p. 8, and for Kirchhoff's use of this passage ib. p. 10). a)potamoi/ato. The distance from Brundisium to Tarentum is one day's 'Eastern sea' the part of the Black Sea at the south-east corner of Scythia with the Cimmerian Bosporus, not fe/ronta: accus. of respect. For the order of the tribes cf. cc. 102. 2, 125. kathko/ntwn. It will be noticed that H. says 'coming down to the sea' not para\\ th\\n qa/lassan: the eastern side only touches sea at its south-east corner. de/ka h(mere/wn o(do/s. The first distance to the Borysthenes is fairly right; the second is really much shorter, being about 130 miles. H. mentions the Palus Maeotis as being the main part of his eastern above. v. 53 H. allows only 150 stades a day on the Royal Road; but South Russia is unusually flat. ta\\ e)s th\\n meso/gaian refers to both sides, the western and the eastern frontier. We have to infer what these are; the western frontier is the Danube (80. 2, 97. 1); the eastern frontier is a small part of the Black Sea and the Cimmerian Bosporus (vid. sup. with the Palus Maeotis and part of the Don. This last point is proved (Rawlinson, iii. 203) from the movements of Darius' army (cf. 120. 2, 122. 3), and from the fact that, though Darius marches through the territory of the Sauromatae and the Budini, he never gets far from Scythia (cc. 124, 125). The story of the campaign is not history, but it is evidence for the geographical conceptions of its author. Niebuhr and Stein are therefore wrong in representing the Don as flowing into the Palus Maeotis just at the north-east corner of Scythia, and thereby excluding that river from the eastern boundary of 'the square'. For H.'s love of symmetry in making Scythia 'square' cf. App. XIII. 7. The customs of the surrounding tribes. Six of these (not the Agathyrsi and the Geloni) had already been mentioned (cc. 17-22), and their position described in relation to Scythia proper. H. now describes their customs. For a similar division as to the Scyths cf. cc. 17-20 (position), cc. 59-80 (customs). Some think the arrangement is merely due to the fact that H. was using different sources. At any rate his attempt to differentiate barbarian tribes is one of his most interesting points. parqe/nw|. Artemis Orthia, whose temple stood on the krhmno/s in front of the city (Strabo 308).

Frazer, G. B. i. 8, iii. 457. The story is familiar in Euripides' drama, 'Iphigeneia in Tauris,' and elsewhere. The Tauri may have been a remnant of the Cimmerians driven into the mountains; some have (improbably) connected their name with that of the Celtic Taurisci. a(bro/tatoi. The Agathyrsi are usually placed in Transylvania (48. 4, the Marosch rises among them), where there were gold mines. They are 'most luxurious' because of their gold. They were probably a Thracian tribe; 'Thyrsi' may be a Scyth form of *trausoi/ (a Thracian tribe, v. 3. 2 and Steph. Byz. s. v.). For their tattooing cf. v. 6. 2 n. and Virg.

The exact date is odd, especially as H. describes the Neuri as back in their land when Darius came (125. 3); nor are the Budini near the Neuri, but far away beyond the Don (c. 21). The snakes are a vera causa, if we may trust J. G. Kohl, a traveller quoted by Neumann. lu/kos gi/netai. This earliest reference to the widespread superstition as to werewolves (cf. Tylor, P. C. i. 308 seq., and Frazer, Paus. iv. 189, for Greek parallels) is interesting, as the evidence is so emphatic. Others (e. g. M\u00fcllenhoff iii. 17) see in this story a reference to some festival like the Lupercalia. The Neuri are placed between the upper course of the Dniester and the Dnieper; some see in them the ancestors of the modern Slavs. *)androfa/goi. Neumann (p. 212) thinks the Androphagi were Finns, quoting evidence that this people were said to practise cannibalism even in the Middle Ages; perhaps they are the ancestors of the Mordvinians, a Finnish tribe still surviving in the Volga basin. This seems more probable than the view of M\u00fcllenhoff (u. s.) that they were not really much different from their neighbours, and that the story of their cannibalism is an invention; he quotes, however, several authorities for cannibalism being imputed to northern races, e. g. Arist. Nic. Ethics, vii. 5 (1148 b). Strabo quotes (302) Ephorus for this cannibalism, but in 201 he throws some doubt on it, both in Scythia and in Ireland. ei(/mata . . . me/lana. This later spread to Olbia (cf. Dio Chrys. Or. xxxvi, p. 50, for it there in the second century A. D.), and lasted till recently among Finnish tribes in south-east Russia (cf. E. B. xviii. 88). The Melanchlaeni are mentioned by Hecataeus (fr. 154, F. H. G. i. 10) as a 'Scyth nation'. Rawlinson compares with the names in 'Dog-eaters' and 'Black Probably 'with blue eyes Tac. Germ. c. 4 'caerulei oculi, rutilae comae', though Stein takes it of the 'red' skin, with Hippocrates (de Aer. our British ancestors; cf. 'picti Geloni', Virg. Georg. ii. 115. Some have seen in the Budini a Teutonic race, but the evidence is too inadequate for certainty.

The town of Gelonus is one of the unsolved puzzles in H.; he seems to speak from good evidence, and the town lay on the north-east trade route (c. 21 n.). But it is difficult to believe in semi-barbarian Greeks so far from the sea. Neumann (p. 91) compares the wooden walls of Saratov, still standing a hundred years ago; Bunbury (i. 195) thinks H.'s informants confused Greek and Slavonian systems of worship. Grote, too, thinks the Geloni may have been Slavs. triethri/das. The Bacchic this disgusting practice the Adyrmachidae (c. 168) in North Africa, who 'crack' lice with their teeth before throwing them away; but H. uses a different word here, and probably means 'fir-cone-eaters'; cf. Photius fqei\\r *pituou=s in which lived a race of fqeirofa/goi (Strabo 492, 496; he, however, clearly thought these to be 'lice-eaters'). tetragwnopro/swpa. Stein, quoting Aristotle (?), Mir. Ausc. 30 (832 b 8), suggests the 'square-faced beasts' are elks (ta/randos); Rawlinson translates 'seals'; but surely some small freshwater beast is meant, e. g. the mink, which is amphibious and found in Eastern Europe; as a species it is intermediate between the marten and the otter. With a broad flat head and blunt muzzle, it may well be called 'square-faced'. The Scyths on the South womb'. *)amazo/nas. The martial habits of the women of the Sauromatae (c. 117 nn.) irresistibly reminded the Greeks of the Amazons (ix. 27. 4 n.), and they are introduced here regardless of the chronological inconsistency that, if the Scyths had come into their land in the seventh century (c. 11), they could not have been found there by the Amazons in the time of Heracles. If the Scyths were descended from Heracles (c. 8), the inconsistency is different, but equally striking. *oi)o/rpata. The first half of the etymology ('man') is probably right, but the latter half of the word is connected with Zend pataya, 'master' (cf. iii. 61 n.). The word then = 'masters of men' (cf. Ephorus, fr. 78, F. H. G. i. 258, the Sauromatae are gunaikokratou/menoi). Thermodon (ii. 104. 3 n.), a river in Cappadocia, where legend especially localized the Amazons. e)fe/ronto. The usual fate of mutineers is skilfully brought in; cf. the tale of the Usipii (Tac. Ag. 28). Kremni in 20. 1 is the eastern boundary of the Royal Scyths on the Palus Maeotis. Its connexion with the ta/fros (c. 20) shows it lay in the south-west, where as a fact the ground is higher than is usual on the Sea of Azov (Westberg, in Klio, iv. 183); others, however, place it on the north coast of that sea. Its name shows it to have been Greek, probably a trading factory. th\\n prw/thn: because the Amazons were all beardless. strato/pedon is usually taken as the subject of prosexw/reon (const. ad sens.); but it is better to translate 'they approached camp to camp', &c. (accus. of respect). The story has a strong resemblance to that of the convent gardener in Boccaccio (Decameron, third day novel), and were it not contradicted by H.'s usual attitude to religion and morals, it would confirm Cornford's silly paradox (Thuc. Myth. p. 239) as to H.'s 'flippant, Parisian, man-of-the-worldly tone'. Addison's burlesque commonwealth (Spec. Nos. 433-4) may well be borrowed from H. here. sune/labon. The greater aptness of the Amazons is a delightful touch of nature; but they were inaccurate (cf. soloiki/zontes c. 117), as lady linguists often are. diaba/ntes ktl. This passage shows that H. conceived the Palus Maeotis as extending east of the Tanais mouth; but it does not show that he thought its general direction was east and west (as Rawlinson). ou) game/etai. Hippocrates (de Aer. c. 17) makes three victims the price of marriage, and says the ladies did not fight afterwards, unless a levy en masse was needed. It is generally supposed that the Sauromatae were the Sarmatians, who later spread west to Poland and Hungary; they were already west of the Tanais in the fourth century (Scylax 70), and by the Christian era they had reached the Danube; cf. Ovid, Tristia, iii. 3. 5-6. On the monuments, Scyths and Sarmatians wear the same dress, Reinach, A. R. M. p. 203, and Hippocrates (u. s. c. 19) makes the Sauromatae to be Scyths. The Sarmatian inscriptions seem to be connected in language with an Iranian dialect in the Caucasus.

For mega/lhn and the triple division generally cf. 7. 2. tw=n a)peipame/nwn. Macan accuses H. of inconsistency, for the Persian attack falls first on the Sauromatae and Budini (123. 3), who were loyal to Scythia, not on the neutrals. But H. is consistent at all events; the single division (\u00a7 2) was to retreat, i)qu\\ *tana/i+dos, i. e. on the Sauromatae, and this is expressly said to have been the one attacked (122. 2); it was the other two divisions (\u00a7 3) which were to draw the Persians on to the neutrals, as they do in 125. 2. But the campaign, though consistent, is not intelligible, and it is lost labour to try to make sense of this fancy picture. ei)=xon ou)de\\n si/nesqai. The Persians must have passed through the lands of the Agricultural Scyths (cc. 17-18), but the land is described as all xe/rsos; H. will not spoil a contrast by mentioning exceptions. He also ignores the great rivers; cf. cc. 51-6. tei/xei+. For the wooden town of Gelonus cf. c. 108. Rawlinson (on c. 142), who is disposed to accept H.'s narrative as generally credible, lays special stress on the burning of this town as a fact that must have been known to the Pontic Greeks. e)rh/mou.

It is probable that popular tradition associated his name with prehistoric tumuli, such as are common in the steppes (see further App. XII, \u00a7 4 d). H. heard of the forts when in Olbia (e)s e)me/, cf. Introd. p. 18), but it is most unlikely that he ever saw them. sfi/si prw=ta diamaxh/sontai.

This story is told by H.'s contemporary, Pherecydes (fr. 113, F.H.G.i. 98), with different speakers, and with the addition of a plough to the other gifts. This last has no meaning as a threat, and it is probably an unintelligent addition to the Herodotean story. The story of Ctesias (17, p. 68) that the Persian and the Scythian kings compared bows, and that Darius, finding the Scythian bow the stronger, fled at once, is far less picturesque or appropriate. e)s ta\\s t. belongs to a)sqenesta/tous. The Persians do here of necessity what (i. 207. 7) they had done against the Massagetae as a stratagem (cf. the use of kaqaro/s in 135. 2 and in i. 211. 2). We may compare Napoleon's abandonment of his sick at Jaffa (Lanfrey, i. 298). h( mi/a. For the 'single' division of Scopasis cf. cc. 120, 128, 133; hitherto it has played consistently the part of 'the light division', now it combines with the e)n Chersonesus Heraclea in the Crimea. For the previous history of Miltiades cf. vi. 39-41 nn. The part played by him is full of difficulty; if he openly purposed to destroy the Great King, how did he so long escape Persian vengeance? Three explanations may be noted. (1) That of Rawlinson may be rejected at once; he thinks that Darius never knew who had proposed his destruction till Miltiades himself boasted of his proposal after 500 B. C. (2) The usual explanation (adopted on vi. 40, q. v.) is that there was treason talked at the bridge, and repressed by Histiaeus, but that Miltiades had no part in it. Long after, however, when on his trial for tyranny at Athens (vi. 104. 2), he claimed (falsely) to have suggested this signal service to the cause of Greece. Thirlwall (ii. 393), who was the first to question the narrative here, thinks Miltiades' first act of treason to Persia was the seizure of Lemnos. It is pointed out that Darius returned to Asia through Miltiades' territory (143. 1; cf. v. 26 n.), and there is no hint in that passage that the tyrant was disloyal. (3) Grote argues (iv. 201), however, that it is dangerous to reject a story as to events known to many and resting on nearly contemporary evidence. Hence he accepts the account of Cornelius Nepos (Milt. c. 3), that Miltiades left the Chersonese at once after the Scythian expedition, and did not return till the time of the Ionic revolt. This suggestion agrees with the fact that Miltiades seems to have served for a time as a condottiere with the Thracian prince Olorus, whose daughter he married (vi. 39), and is confirmed by vi. 41. 3\u2014 the importance attached to the capture of his son. This arrangement of the facts can perhaps be reconciled with the account in vi. 40, though it is odd that H. mentions there a flight from the Scyths, and says nothing of this (supposed) previous flight from the Persians, which Nepos (u. s.) definitely mentions. It may be suggested that Miltiades' sympathy with the Scyths was of early date. There is a fine vase in the Ashmolean Museum (dating about 520 B. C.) with the inscription *miltia/dhs kalo/s, representing a handsome young warrior in Scythian costume (cf. Helbig, Les i(ppei=s ath\u00e9niens, p. 199; P. Gardner, Greek Vases in A shmolean, no. 310, pl. 13, who calls the costume 'Persian'). dia\\ *darei=on . . . turanneu/ei. The identity of interest between tyrant and foreign ruler was undoubtedly true of H.'s own day (cf. the position of Themistocles or of Demaratus under Persian rule). This fact makes H. as a patriot more bitter against tyrants, and more ready to accept this story to their discredit in the past. tu/rannoi. The list is curious and interesting: six of the eleven are 'Hellespontic', while an important island like Lesbos, whose 'general' (97. 2; he became 'tyrant' later, v. 11. 2), Co\u00ebs, had a high position with Darius (c. 97), is not mentioned; nor are there any Dorians (cf. their absence in the story of the Ionic revolt). These peculiarities may be explained by attributing it to Miltiades, who naturally preferred to mention his neighbours. For Hippoclus cf. Thuc. vi. 59. 3. Strattis lived till after 480 B. C.; cf. viii. 132. 2. Aeaces had already succeeded his father Syloson (iii. 139. seq.; for the name cf. iii. 39. 1 n., and for his later history vi. 13). For Aristagoras of Cumae cf. v. 37. 1, 38. 1. a)/drhsta: active here, the opposite of drape/ths. Macan well notes the literary device of making the 'intelligent foreigner' the mouthpiece of unfavourable judgements, and cf. 77. *shsto/n. Byzantium (v. 26. 1) is in revolt against Persia soon after, and this may be the reason why Darius did not return by the former bridge. Stein assumes that the Scyth invasion of vi. 40 happened at this time, which is most unlikely. *kalxhdoni/ous. Both this and Byzantium were Megarian colonies; the date of the founding of Byzantium was about 660 B. C., but the chronologers vary slightly; cf. Busolt, i. 472. Tacitus (Ann. xii. 63) attributes to the Delphic oracle this rebuke of the Calchedonians (cf. also Strabo 320). For an elaborate account of the advantages of the site of Byzantium cf. Polyb. iv. 38. The rest of this book deals with the history and the natural features of North Africa and its inhabitants. H. skilfully introduces this digression, as it illustrates (with the Scythian expedition) the farreaching ambitions of the Persians. This digression falls into four parts: (1) The colonization of Cyrene (cc. 145-58): of this, the story of Thera (cc. 145-9) is the prologue. (2) The history of Cyrene to the Persian intervention (cc. 159-67). (3) The account of the Libyans (cc. 168-99). There can be little doubt that this minor digression is a further motive for the full treatment of North African history; H. was with reason proud of his geographical and ethnographical knowledge. (4) The results of Persian intervention (cc. 200-5). Many of the references to modern travellers are drawn from R. Neumann (Nord-Afrika nach Herodot, Leipzig, 1892, a very clear and useful little book) and from Rawlinson, who usually quotes passages in full. The comparisons are interesting and greatly to the credit of H. as a sifter of evidence, especially when we remember the proverbial unveracity of Oriental witnesses. 'Happy are they who find the least resemblance between the description they have heard and the reality, for it often occurs that amplification and hyperbole have less to do in such accounts than pure invention.' Beechey (Expedition to North Coast of Africa, 1821-2, p. 503), who elsewhere (p. 267), speaking of Barca, says the account of H. is more accurate in the general impression it gives than that of any later traveller. to\\n au)to\\n . . . xro/non. There is no good reason to doubt the synchronism, though most modern critics think it artificial. Duncker (vi. 266, 271) uses it to explain the absence of the Phoenician fleet in Scythia. The exact date, however, does not interest H., and cannot be fixed; it must be earlier than the suppression of Aryandes' revolt (cf. 166. 2 n.). H. gives the pro/fasis in c. 167, where he states the expedition was intended 'to conquer Libyans' (i. e. the Eastern ones); this motive is probably the real one, though H.'s own narrative (c. 203) does not agree with it, and the plan failed (cf. 197. 1). ta/de. The account of the colonization of Thera and Cyrene. H. seems deliberately to introduce this digression, in order to illustrate this important feature in Greek life. Whether the facts are true or not, they represent fifth-century thought as to colonization. I. Its causes:(1) sta/sis. (a) The Minyae are in a position of inferiority (146. 1); (b) Theras excluded from the throne (147. 3); (c) Battus born out of wedlock (155. 1 (151. 1; but see n.).(3) Commercial enterprise.(4) Delphic sanction and guidance (passim, cf. v. 42 n.).II. The stages of colonization:(1) The reconnoitring expedition (151. 3; 156. 2).(2) The settlement off the coast, Platea.(3) The constitutional development (c. 161 ad fin.).III. The relations of Greeks and natives (especially interesting): (1) At first friendly, but with suspicion (158. 2).(2) Then frankly hostile (c. 160).(3) In spite of this, great admixture. For this last cf. common customs (c. 170; 189. 3); common worships (186. 2; c. 189); actual intermarriage, e. g. Alazir (164. 4), father-in-law to Arcesilaus III. This explains the brutal cruelty of Pheretime (c. 202), which is quite un-Hellenic. Some see (e. g. Macan ii. 265) in the two stories of the Minyan settlement in Laconia, and of the settlement of Cyrene, 'aetiological legends' explaining present facts; 'the former justified the Spartan supremacy in Laconia; the second the Spartan claim over Thera' (cf. for this the similar legend as to Patrae, Paus. iii. 2. 1). That the stories are unhistorical in form needs no proof; and it may be the case that the real connexion between Laconia and Thera dates at earliest from the seventh century (Studniczka, vid. inf.). But the only argument adduced (ib. p. 51) is that the Spartan Dorians were at first too weak to send out colonies. This is valid against the Herodotean version of the facts, but has no bearing on the wider question, the date of the Dorization of Thera; this may well have been part of the same movement that Dorized the Peloponnese. This earlier date is partly confirmed by the 700 years which the Melians claim for their city in 416 B. C. (Thuc. v. 112. 2). The story of the two foun dations is examined by F. Studniczka in a book ('Cyrene', 1890) full of ingenious hypotheses, most of which are unprovable and many of which are improbable. For his summary cf. Roscher, ii. 1734 f. His main conclusions are: (1) The fact that the legends always connect the nymph Cyrene with Thessaly (pp. 39 f., 45) shows that the colonists came from this part of the world. (2) Their route was by Attica, as is shown by the occurrence of Attic place-names in the island (p. 65; cf. Busolt, i. 353). (3) The connexion of Dorians with Thera was later than the first Messenian war, and led to troubles in Thera, and ultimately to the expulsion of the original colonists, who go to Cyrene (cf. 156. 3 n.). (4) Dorian encroachment spreads to Cyrene (p. 103, cf. cc. 159, 161), and ultimately leads to the expulsion of the royal house. (5) Cyrene herself is a form of Artemis (cf. the name *qh/ra, p. 146), who is degraded into a heroine; her worship is superseded when the Cyrenian democracy is established (p. 173, cf. Arist. Pol. vi. 4, 1319 b, quoted on 161. 3). (6) The connexion of the Minyae with Lemnos, their settlement in Thera, and the connexion of Theras with Thebes are all cut out as later inventions. All these guesses and combinations are as devoid of real evidence as the story in H.; they have the additional disadvantage of being more than 2,000 years further from the facts. e)pibate/wn. In vi. 12. 1 e)piba/tai is opposed to e)re/tai; but the Argonauts were au)tere/tai (cf. Thuc. i. 10. 4). pai/dwn pai=des, 'descendants'; for the Minyans were driven out in the fifth generation (147. 2 and App. XIV. 2) after Heracles, who was one of the Argonauts. For Pelasgians in Lemnos cf. vi. 137 n. Taygetus occurs again in 148. 2. The subsequent connexion of Euphemus, the ancestor of Battus, with this region (Pind. Pyth. 4. 78-9) makes it possible that there was a prehistoric settlement of non-Dorians here, connected specially with Thera. Euphemus is turned by Studniczka (p. 116) into an euphemistic name of a chthonian god, who lives at the gate of Hades, Taenarum! This is a fine example of the 'Higher Criticism'. pai=des. The Argonauts found Lemnos inhabited only by women, who had killed their fathers and husbands (Apollod. i. 9. 17); Hypsipyle had spared her father Thoas (Ov. Her. 6. 135). The later population of Lemnos was the result of their visit. For this story cf. Il. vii. 467-9 (Euneos the Lemnian, a son of Jason). *tundaride/wn. Some see an inconsistency here, because the mass of the Lacedaemonians were Dorians, and the Tyndaridae as Achaeans were alien to them. The story is obviously unhistorical, but the Tyndarid reference is only an anachronistic anticipation of the later Spartan claim to be the heirs of Agamemnon (vii. 159. 1). The legend also aims at emphasizing the connexion between Lacedaemon and Thera. This story of admission to citizenship is interesting as showing none of the exclusiveness which later was so characteristic at Sparta (cf. ix. 35. 1 n.; Arist. Pol. ii. 9. 17, 1270 a). It is probable, on other grounds, that this exclusiveness was late, due to the growth of Lacedaemonian power after 550 B. C. nukto/s. H. introduces contemporary custom into the legend; the custom (cf. Plat. Apol. c. 27) was due partly to the secrecy of Spartan methods (cf. the secret executions by the Venetian oligarchy), partly to their unwillingness to put a citizen to death. e)kfugo/ntes. The story is familiar and has many parallels, e. g. Lord Nithsdale's escape from the Tower in 1715. Plutarch tells it (Mor. 247) with features in the main similar, but the husbands are Pelasgians, not Minyae, and they settle in Melos and Crete. mhtro\\s a)delfeo/s. Some see in the relationship a misunderstood tradition of the matriarchate (i. 173. 4 n.), but it is probably accidental. The lady's name was Argeia (vi. 52). Theras is no doubt 'a fictitious eponym', and many critics deny the Cadmeans were Phoenician (v. i.). For H.'s mythical genealogies and their bearing on his chronology cf. App. XIV. 2, where the 'eight' (\u00a7 5) generations are given. *membli/arew: Studniczka (p. 53) makes this a Greek name = 'the new-comer' (cf. me/mblwka), which is a sufficiently reckless etymology. *ka/dmos ga/r. On the subject of the Phoenicians in Greece, most diverse views are held. I. The Negative Argument. Beloch (Griech. Gesch. p. 75) maintains that the Phoenicians never really settled in the Aegean, that their regular voyages to Greece did not begin before the eighth century B. C. (p. 74), and that Minos, Phoenix, Cadmus, Europa (p. 168) are all 'good Greek gods'; the sea empire of Minos is a mere inference from names, and 'Phoenix' is explained as a sun myth ('the blood-red', p. 75). The grounds for this ultra-scepticism are: (1) That the Phoenicians do not appear in the oldest parts of Homer; unfortunately for Beloch's argument, there is no general agreement which are the oldest parts. (2) The scanty traces of Semitic influence on Greek vocabulary; even the words for sea-faring are native; Beloch contrasts Latin borrowings in this department from Greek. Meyer, i. 476, gives a list of words borrowed by Greeks and Semites from some common source. (3) Cyprus was certainly influenced by the Phoenicians (cf. v. 104 nn.); but it lies outside the ordinary lines of Greek development. Archaeology has already crushed one part of Beloch's negative argument by proving the reality of Cretan sea-power, although it has at the same time disproved the opposite view (Thirlwall, i. 141), that the Cretan sea-power was Phoenician. With regard to the rest of Beloch's argument, in spite of Reinach's warning against 'Le Mirage de l'Orient', many scholars still believe that the Greeks were to some extent right in attributing importance to Phoenician influences in Greece. Meyer (ii1. 89, 1893) wrote: 'The voyages of the Phoenicians in their historical importance can be compared with the discovery of America in the fifteenth century. They introduced the sea into history.' 'Many of the data (as to their settlements in the Aegean) may be untrustworthy; to explain them all as unhistorical is impossible' (ib. \u00a7 90). II. Evidence for Phoenician Settlement. The main kinds of evidence used for tracing the presence of Phoenicians in Greece are (ib. 91), apart from statements of ancient historians: (1) The evidence of names, both geographical (e. g. Mount Atabyris in Rhodes compared with Mount Tabor; the river Iardanus in Crete, Soli in Cilicia) and personal, e. g. the Corinthian hero Melicertes (i. e. Melcarth). For other instances cf. Abbott, History, i. 50; but this evidence is most uncertain. (2) The evidence of remains, e. g. the beds of murex shells at Cythera and on the Euripus. (3) The evidence of family traditions, e. g. the priests of Poseidon at Ialysus (Diod. v. 58), the family of Thales (i. 170. 3 n.). (4) The evidence of cult; the ritual impurity of some of the cults of Aphrodite may have been borrowed, or, at any rate, developed (e. g. at Corinth; cf. i. 131. 3 n.) under Phoenician influence. It must be admitted, however, that all these lines of evidence are in themselves weak; it is only their cumulative force, coupled with the danger of rejecting a tradition held by the Greeks so firmly, that makes it safer to accept Phoenician influence in Greece as a fact. III. Lines of Phoenician Influence. The following points may be suggested as to it: (1) Phoenician trade and settlements, so far as they existed in Greece, belong to the period immediately succeeding the downfall of the 'Mycenaean' civilization. (2) They entered the Aegean by Rhodes (cf. the oriental objects in the necropolis of Camirus, and u. s. for Ialysus). (3) From Rhodes one line of Phoenician influence went by Crete and the Islands (cf. Thuc. i. 8. 1) to Cythera (i. 105. 3), to Corinth, and perhaps to Attica (cf. the story of the bull of Marathon); the name of the deme Melite may be Semitic (cf. 'Malta'). Another line went up the east coast of Asia Minor to the Propontis and to Thasos (cf. vi. 47. 2 for the Phoenician mines). (4) Whatever view may be held as to Phoenician cult influences (and these are generally accepted at Cythera and at Corinth), there seems no doubt that the Greeks learned the purple fishery and the art of mining from the Phoenicians. (5) The alphabet was introduced from the East by them (v. 58 n.). (6) But with one possible exception, what Thucydides says of Sicily (vi. 2. 6) was in the main true of Greece proper\u2014they just referred to must now be discussed. IV. Was there a Phoenician Settlement in Boeotia? (For a full discussion of the evidence cf. B\u00e9rard, Les Ph\u00e9niciens et l'Odyss\u00e9e, i. 224 f.) To the Greeks of H.'s time this was the most important fact in the Phoenician story (ii. 49. 3; v. 57. 1); but it is perhaps the most uncertain in the whole cycle of the legends. Against the reality of Cadmus it may be argued: (1) That an older myth attributed the foundation of Thebes to Amphion and Zethus, the sons of a native nymph (Od. xi. 262). (2) That the supposed Phoenician features in the story, the guiding 'cow' and the 'seven' gates, are not original (cf. Busolt, i. 252. n. 2). (3) That the oldest story of Thebes has elements in it which are clearly native, e. g. the 'earth-born' *spartoi/ (Pind. Isth. i. 30). (4) That though 'Qedem' certainly is a Semitic word for 'East', there is no parallel for the derivation of such a proper name as 'Cadmus'. (5) That H. himself tells us that the Gephyraeans, whom he seeks to prove Cadmeans, themselves believed they came from Eretria (v. 57. 1). On the other hand, the supposed priority of the non-Phoenician foundation myths is by no means certain, and the improbability is great that later invention would settle on Boeotia for the main Phoenician settlement in Greece. Geographical position, too, argues strongly in favour of the truth of the myth; a Phoenician settlement in Boeotia commanded alike the Euripus, the Corinthian, and the Saronic gulf, for Megara was probably part of Boeotia in early times (cf. Strabo 405), and so that district was, as Ephorus said (Strabo 400), triqa/lattos. As B\u00e9rard (i. 226) well 'Continental Greece, under Franks, Catalans, Venetians, had in Boeotia the centre of its commercial routes.' There was probably a trade-route from the Euripus to the Corinthian gulf, past Thebes, Orchomenus, and Crisa, as well as one over the passes of Cithaeron to the Saronic gulf. Hence it would be at least possible that the Phoenicians made their chief settlement in Boeotia. fule/wn. The legend anachronistically represents the colony as a formalone, with settlers from each of the three Dorian tribes (cf. 153. 1). The Caucones (i. 147) were one of the prehistoric races of Greece; they are called *parwrea=tai here because of their position on the 'slope' of the Arcadian highland, where it approaches nearest to the sea; in viii. 73. 2 the same name is applied to their Lemnian conquerors. In this difficult district of Triphylia, between Elis and Messenia, remnants of an earlier race maintained themselves; their centre was the temple of the 'Samian Poseidon' (Strabo 343). The most important town was Lepreum, here put at the head of the list; it sent 200 men to Plataea (ix. 28. 4). For the identification of these towns cf. Leake, Peloponnese, i. 56 f. e)p' e)me/o: a provokingly vague date. The 'harrying' is placed by Strabo (355) 'after the final reduction of the Messenians', i. e. soon after 460 B. C.; the Eleans had assisted the Lacedaemonians while the Triphylians had been against them; the same alliances had been formed at the end of the Second Messenian war (cf. Strabo 362 for Triphylia). So Meyer iii. 285 puts this Elean raid soon after 470 B. C.; he now (iv. 606), however, refers it to the period before the Peace of Nicias, when the Lacedaemonians changed their policy, and supported Lepreum against Elis (Thuc. v. 31). *ai)geu/s. This is the Spartan version, but there were Aegidae at Thebes and Acragas as well as at Thera and Cyrene, all hereditary priests of Carnean Apollo. Pindar, who himself claimed to be one of them (Pyth. v. 75, but Studniczka, p. 73 f., disputes this explanation), makes them come with the Heraclidae from Thebes to Sparta (Isth. 7. 14 seq.). fulh=| is loosely used for fratri/a|: Gilbert (Gk. Const. Hist. pp. 5-6) thinks the Aegidae were really a 'third separate community' at Sparta. The Erinys is the personified curse of a father or mother; cf. Soph. O. C. 1299th\\n sh\\n *)erinu/n (of Oedipus). The curses here are those of Laius on Oedipus and of Oedipus on his two sons. Paus. iii. 15. 6 tells us there were shrines at Sparta to the heroes Cadmus, Oeolycus, and Aegeus. For the belief in a curse making a family die out cf. Sir H. Spelman's famous book on Sacrilege (1698). The story of the foundation of Cyrene is told in two versions, that of Thera (150-3) and that of Cyrene (154-6): both lay stress upon the action of the oracle. The main points of difference are: (1) The Theraean version emphasizes the foundation as being a regular colony, e. g. the order is given to the king and the colonists are systematically provided (c. 153). (2) The other version brings Battus much more into the foreground. For various speculations, not very convincing, as to the origin of the traditions cf. Busolt, i. 479 n. It is interesting to compare Pindar's odes to Cyrenaic victors (Pyth. iv, v, ix), as they illustrate the wealth of legendary material from which H. had to select. The name *gri=nnos is found in a late inscription, now at Verona but probably from Thera, the well-known 'testamentum Epictetae' (C. I. G. ii. 2448). e(kato/mbhn. The early king is also priest (cf. 161. 3). At Sparta the king communicated with Delphi by deputy (vi. 57. 2). In a late inscription at Thera the priest of Apollo Carneus boasts his descent from Lacedaemonian 'kings'. *eu)fhmi/dhs is a conjecture from Pyth. iv, where Pindar, in praising Arcesilaus, introduces the legend that his ancestor Euphemus (cf. 145. 2 n.) had handselled the soil of Libya, receiving a clod of earth from Triton (Pyth. iv. 36). H. makes no reference to the story. ou)k u(=e. Some see in this drought a picturesque version of what really was a vera causa of Greek colonization, i. e. over-population; but this seems far-fetched. Justin (xiii. 7) substitutes a pestilence for the drought. For the visitation cf. Soph. O. T. 25 seq. metoi/kwn. 'Metic' occurs only here in H.; it clearly is not used in a technical sense (though some have thought it = a)pe/tairoi of the Gortyn inscription), but only = 'strangers', i. e. non-Cretans. *korw/bios. Busolt (i. 480) thinks Corobius one of the a(/lioi ge/rontes, a sea-god of Itanus (cf. the representations on the fifthcentury coins of Itanus, Head, H. N. 469); as, however, he admits that the colonists must have touched at Crete, and 'may well have employed Cretan guides', it is a little hard to see why Corobius should not be a real person. At any rate the Cretans had an important share in the colony (161. 3). Platea is Bomba, in the gulf of the same name, on the east of the modern Tripoli. Corobius was left to secure the site (cf. 157. 3), but it is difficult to see why an alien should be chosen for this, or why in fact any competition was to be expected. Colaeus is at once ship-owner (nau/klhros), captain, and merchant (cf. i. 5. 2). The usual course was by Rhodes and Cyprus (cf. ii. 182. 2 n.); hence a)phnei/xqh.

For further connexion between Cyrene and Samos cf. 163. 1. e(/ade. There were four points in the Theraean decree: (a) The number of colonists must have been fixed. This is omitted by H., unless it has fallen out of his text. (b) They were to be selected by lot, but only sons (a)delfeo\\n a)p' a)delfeou=) were exempted. (c) Every district of the island was to contribute a share.

Battus' real name was Aristoteles (Pyth. v. 116), as H. must have known; 'Battus' is a title (v. i.) that has become a name; cf. Augustus. It is a Libyan word, though it occurs later as a Greek name (Thuc. iv. 43. 1). The legend of his stammering is probably an invention based on the likeness of *ba/ttos and battari/zw. h( *puqi/h. The oracle is no doubt post eventum, otherwise the familiarity with the Libyan title, 'Battus,' would confirm the oracle's claim in 157. 2. sunefe/reto paligko/tws: translate 'their misfortunes began again'. paligko/tws is used of a wound becoming malignant again. No previous misfortune occurs in the Cyrenaic version of the story, but H. probably refers to o( au)xmo/s of 151. 1, forgetting that it is the very visitation which he is here mentioning. paligko/tws, however, often = 'adverse' without any idea of recurrence. du/o penthkonte(roisi, 'two penteconters' carry the final colony in the Theraean version (c. 153); but here they seem to correspond to the reconnoitring expedition of 151. 2. e)/ballon. Stein thinks these lines contain a reference to the real origin of Cyrene, i. e. sta/sis at Thera, as related by Menecles of Barca (a historian of the second century B. C. at earliest; F. H. G. iv. 449, fr. 1). But his version is probably only an attempt to rationalize H. This chapter seems to belong to the common version of Thera and Cyrene; but the detail e(/na katalipo/ntes came in at an earlier stage of the Theraean story (151. 3). e)lqo/ntos. Apollo's visit was when he brought the Thessalian maid Cyrene to Libya, and made her queen of a land polu/mhlos (Pind. Pyth. ix. 10); but the country was not really famed for its sheep. sofi/hn seu. The priests as usual explain the failure of their own prediction by the ignorance of the recipient (i. 167. 4 n.). The name Aziris is clearly Libyan. H. seems to speak as an eyewitness; there is nothing inconsistent with this view in the le/getai of 156. 3, which only means that H. had not measured Platea himself. Aziris would then be the place called in Smith and Grove 'Paliurus'. Others, however, following the Stadiasmus Maris Magni (G. G. M. i. 444, a compilation of uncertain date), place Aziris, there called Azaris, further north, outside the Gulf of Bomba. paraithsa/menoi. The friendly yet half-grudging relations of Greeks and aborigines are well seen in this passage; they soon changed to hostility (c. 159), while in c. 160 the Libyans are subjects who revolt. Irasa was identified by Pacho (pp. 84-5) as a spot, still called Ersen, on the edge of the Libyan plateau, above the Gulf of Bomba; he points out that this would be a natural place (159. 5) to meet an army attacking from the east. Its abundant water and vegetation confirm ka/lliston. The spring of Apollo, called *ku/rh, is mentioned by Pindar, Pyth. iv. 294; it is identified at Cyrene; cf. ib. p. 423 seq., for a description; also Hogarth, A. A. L. p. 132. The name is probably the origin of 'Cyrene' ('the heroine of the spring'); but Studniczka maintains that 'Cyre' is only a shortened form (p. 143), and that the name occurs elsewhere in Anti-cyra, Themis-cyra, &c. (in Roscher, u. s.). o( ou)rano\\s 'sky is pierced' as a symbol of fertility; cf. Mal. iii. 10 'windows of heaven'. There is probably also a reference to the abundant winter rains at Cyrene (contrast c. 185 n.). The date of the founding of Cyrene, 631 B. C., rests on Eusebius; it agrees with the facts in H. that the first two kings ruled fifty-six years (c. 159), and that the Egyptian attack (ii. 161), which we know was in 570 B. C., was in the time of Battus II, the third king. For the whole subject cf. Busolt, i. 482 n. For recent exploration there (begun 1910) cf. J. H. S. xxxi. 301. History of Cyrene; but this is interrupted by the long digression on Libya, 168-199, which divides into two parts at 180. oi)kiste/w. Battus as 'oecist' enjoyed heroic honours at the top of the market-place of Cyrene (Pind. P. v. 93); cf. Miltiades in the Chersonese, vi. 38. 1, and v. 47. 2 n. for hero worship generally. tosou=toi. H. only means that there was no new immigration for the first half-century. gh=s a)nadasmo/s was generally the mark of a revolution in Greece; with xrew=n a)pokopai/ (Dem. in Timoc. p. 746, \u00a7 149) it was renounced in the Heliastic oath at Athens. Aristotle (Pol. v. 5. 3, 1305 a 4) mentions it as one of the causes which overthrow democracies by driving the wealthy to desperation. We have an instance at Cyrene later (163. 1), at Syracuse after the fall of the Gelonian dynasty (Diod. xi. 86), and at Leontini (circ. 422 B. C.; Thuc. v. 4). Here, however, it is not a revolutionary measure, for the land to be divided was that of the natives; hence it leads to foreign, not to civil war. ga=s a)nadaiome/nas is the gen. after the comparative u(/steron, 'too late for the division of the land.' *)apri/h|. H. here fulfils his promise in ii. 161. 3 that he would relate 'more fully' in his Libyan lo/goi the reason for Apries' attack on Cyrene. It is, to say the least, odd (in view of ii. 152 seq.) that he should represent (\u00a7 6) the Egyptians as 'being ignorant and contemptuous of' Greeks. po/lin. Barca lies to the west of Cyrene on the high ground on the east coast of the Syrtis. Its name still survives as that of the district. The mixture of native blood in its population was strong, as is seen from this chapter; cf. also 164. 4 and c. 202 nn. Perhaps H. means by h(\\ to/te kale/etai that it was already existing as a Libyan settlement. Nicolaus Damascenus (fr. 52, F. H. G. iii. 387) follows H., but Plutarch (Mor. 260) and Polyaenus (viii. 41) make the murder of Arcesilaus a political one, while Plutarch adds that Laarchus had been supported by Amasis, and that the conspirators against him submitted to the king of Egypt in order to avoid punishment. This can be reconciled with the story in ii. 181, and is probably a fact, though H.'s Cyrenaean informants concealed the part played by Egypt out of patriotism. There are other discrepancies, e. g. Learchus is Laarchus in Plutarch and Polyaenus, who make him 'friend', and not 'brother', Arcesilaus; cf. Maspero, iii. 645 n. e)/pempon e)s *delfou/s. The traditional constitution of Cyrene had broken down, owing to (1) the increase of population (159. 4); (2) the disaster at Leucon (cf. Arist. Pol. v. 3. 7, 1303 a for the effect of success or failure abroad on constitutional development at home); (3) the dissensions in the royal house. It was necessary both to admit new citizens to full privileges and to weaken the royal power. For Delphi interfering to end civil strife cf. Curtius, ii. 87. Polybius (vi. 43) mentions the constitu tions of Mantinea, Crete, Lacedaemon, and Carthage as famed for their excellence. Shortly before this time a similar appeal for katasta/tw to Mantinea, from Scillus in Elis, is recorded in an inscription (I. G. A. Add. 119, l. 13; sed incerta lectio). katasth/samenoi: cf. v. 92. b 1 kata/stasis, 'in what way they should organize themselves.' For the work of Demonax cf. M\u00fcller, Dor. ii. 62-3. He is probably not referred to in the famous passage in the Politics vi. 4. 18-19, 1319 b 19 seq. (see Newman ad loc.) as to constitutional changes intended to increase the power of democracy, where 'those who set up the democracy at Cyrene' (probably in 401 B. C.) are coupled with Cleisthenes of Athens. of Demonax were: (1) original settlers retain their priority and the right to hold serfs (peri/oikoi); (2) new-comers are admitted to full citizenship; (3) monarchy becomes formal. Others (e. g. Busolt, i. 490 n. 2) think the peri/oikoi are Libyans admitted to full citizenship. i(erwsu/nas. So Maeandrius asked to be allowed to retire with a priesthood (iii. 142); cf. for priesthood as the last survival of royalty Arist. Pol. iii. 14. 13, 1285 b, and (to some extent) Sparta (vi. 56. 1). For Euelthon cf. v. 104 n. For the Corinthian treasury cf. i. 14. 2 n. H.'s praise of the 'censer' suggests that part at any rate of this story was heard by him at Delphi. The tense of dido/menon is emphatic; only the 'spindle and distaff' 'with wool' actually given, the rest were simply 'offered'. e)n *sa/mw|. The alliance of Arcesilaus and Samos is commemorated in the types of a Cyrenaic tetradrachm, with the lion's head (of Samos) as well as the silphium (Hill, G. and R. C. p. 114 and Pl.i. 15). xra=|. The oracle is done into prose, but the tags of hexameters are obvious. It throws an interesting but perplexing light on the date when H. gathered his materials. It is obviously a prediction post eventum, made after the eighth and last Battiad had been deposed; this was about 460 B. C. Pindar certainly knew nothing of it in 466, when he sang the glory of the Battiads (Pyth. iv. 115). th\\n xrhsmou=inf.); (B.

To Cyprus; i. e. presumably to his mother. Alazir, whether proper name or title (like 'Battus'), is significant of Libyan intermixture even in the blood royal. *)arkesi/lew eu)ergesi/ai. In iii. 13 H. mentions the submission of Cyrene, but lays stress on the inadequate tribute sent. The story here, though not absolutely inconsistent, is curiously different in tone; H. has not harmonized his two sources, and Cyrenaic tradition clearly slurred over the fact of submission to Persia (cf. 160. 4 n.). xrusi/on kaqarw/taton. The Persian darics (cf. iii. 89. 3 n.) have only three per cent. of alloy; cf. iii. 95. 1 n. Whether Darius was the first to coin them (as Grote assumes), H. does not say; Harpocration (Schol. ad Aristophanes, Eccles. 598) says they were coined before his time (cf. Hill, G. C. p. 27), but probably wrongly. a)rgu/rion. Aryandes' offence was not coining in itself, but doing it in obvious rivalry with the Great King; the satraps coined silver, but only when military officers. Babelon, Les Perses Ach\u00e9m. p. xxiii. The revolt of Aryandes is variously dated from 517 to 494 B. C. (Macan, ii. 263; Busolt, ii. 532). The monuments are quoted in support of both dates; the literary evidence favours a later one; for H. conceives of Aryandes as copying the coinage of Darius, and this can hardly have been an established institution till after the settlement of the satrapies (iii. 89), circ. 516 B. C. Moreover, Darius suppressed the revolt in person (Polyaenus, vii. 11. 7), and he visited Egypt after the Scythian expedition (ii. 110). *mara/fion; cf. i. 125 n. Amasis was probably a Persian who had assumed an Egyptian name (i. 135); many Babylonian names preserved on seals may well be those of Persians (E. M. iii. 21). Nomad Libyans (Eastern tribes) along the sea-coast. The Libyans are the predecessors of the Berbers; they were comparatively a light-skinned and fair-haired race. H.'s division (c. 191) at Lake Tritonis is 'obviously right', i. e. he contrasts the Atlas system on the west with the flatter region of Tripoli on the east (R. Neumann, Nord-Afrika nach H., 1892, p. 11). The western part was the sphere of the Carthaginian influence (hence H. makes it agricultural, c. 191), and belongs really rather to Europe than to North Africa (cf. Macan's excellent note on c. 191). The Adyrmachidae extend further west in H. than in Scylax (107; G. G. M. i. 82), who makes them 'ruled by Egyptians'. fqei=ras. For 'lice-eating' cf. the modern Hottentots and 109. 2 n. tw=| basile/i+. For this 'droit du seigneur' cf. Westermarck, p. 76 seq., who quotes parallels, but argues that it is not to be taken as evidence of primitive promiscuity; it prevailed among the Berbers (St. Martin, p. 43) till the nineteenth century. *pluno/s: i. e. the Gulf of Sollum, which has been brought into such prominence recently (1911) in the Italo-Turkish war, as the west limit of Egypt. Here the Catabathmus Major forms a natural frontier. The Giligamae are only mentioned by H. and writers who borrow from him; they perhaps correspond to the later Marmaridae. si/lfion. For a long discussion of the silphium cf. R. Neumann, p. 146 seq., or B\u00e4hr ad loc. It is often identified with the modern Thapsia Garganica (Arab. Drias); it is true this does not correspond to the representations of it on the coins, which make it thick in stem; but these equally disagree with the description of Pliny, xix. 42 ('caule ferulaceo'). (For the coins of Cyrene cf. Head, H. N. 864 seq.; for the question whether coin-types are commercial or religious cf. Hill, G. and R. C., p. 166 seq.) Pliny (xxii. 101 seq.) gives a long and amusing catalogue of the medicinal virtues of silphium, though ex alto.' It was a royal monopoly and a main source of the wealth of Cyrene; cf. Aristoph., Pl. 925, to\\ *ba/ttou si/lfion (proverbial). Owing to over-production it became almost extinct in the first century A. D., but is now common again in the degenerate form of the Drias. Pacho (p. 54) notes 'la grande exactitude' of H. in fixing its locality. Others, however (e. g. Head, u. s.), say the true silphium is extinct; for the arguments cf. Ascherson in Rohlfs, K. p. 524. sto/ma is a curious word for the promontory from which the bay of the Greater Syrtis (ii. 32. 2) bends south; but Scylax (109, G. G. M. i. 84) uses it. H. only knows one Syrtis and never describes it. The coast here was notoriously dangerous from its shifting sandbanks; lege invia sedes'. The of 161. 3 n. teqrippoba/tai. For the four-horse chariots cf. 189. 3 n. Euesperides, which became Berenice under Ptolemy (hence the modern name 'Benghazi'), was said by Theotimus of Cyrene to have been formally founded by Arcesilaus IV (F. H. G. iv. 517, fr. 1); but if this statement be true, it existed in some form previously (c. 204). All the geographers agree in placing the Nasamones on the shores of the Greater Syrtis. Augila (c. 182; hod. 'Audschila') is an important oasis in the latitude of Cyrene, on the caravan route to Fezzan; it is still a great centre of date production. Pacho (p. 280) says H.'s descriptions detail the correspondences. Rohlfs (Tripolis nach Alex. ii. 49) estimated the palms as over 200,000 in 1869, but in 1879 found them much less numerous (K. p. 220). au)h/nantes. For the eating of locusts (a)ttele/bous) cf. Matt. iii. 4 of John the Baptist. Diod. iii. 29 gives a description of the 'locusteaters' in Africa, a 'marvellously black' race, who live only on this food, and die before they are forty by a disgusting death brought on by it. The chapter is a significant contrast to H.'s veracity. Duveyrier (p. 240) says the Tuaregs eat locusts 'dried and reduced to powder'. e)pi/koinon: cf. i. 216. 1 n. for polyandry among the Massagetae. H. here describes, not very clearly, a curious form of groupmarriage. Strabo (783) describes an Arabian tribe where the whole family enjoys wives in common; there also the r(a/bdos is used as the sign of possession (cf. W. Robertson Smith, K. A.2 p. 157 seq., for this 'Ba'al polyandry'). tu/mbwn. For this divination in the tombs cf. Duveyrier, p. 435; the women of the Tuaregs inquire among the tombs as to their absent husbands. For dream oracles in general cf. viii. 134 n. Shaw (i. 431, 3rd ed.) says that the drinking out of each other's hands is the only ceremony used by the Algerines in their marriage; cf. the story of Eleazar and Rebecca for an approach to this idea (Gen. xxiv. 14, 43). spodou=. So the Mahometan law permits ablutions to be done with sand if water is lacking; cf. Tylor, P. C. ii. p. 440. proso/mouroi. Strabo (838) places the Psylli east of the Nasamones; H. obviously places them on the west, on the south coast (e)nto/s) of the Syrtis. e)pi\\ to\\n no/ton. For similar wars with the elements cf. the Getae, 94. 4 n., and Arist. Eth. Nic. iii. 7. 7 (the Celts are said not to fear the waves). Strabo (293) rightly criticizes this latter story. Pliny (vii. 14) more probably puts down the partial destruction of the Psylli to the Nasamones; H. himself implies (ei)si/) the destruction was not complete, and the Psylli are often mentioned later; they were famous as snake-charmers. *gara/mantes. Obviously the name of the 'Garamantes' has been introduced here wrongly from c. 183. Pliny (v. 44-5) seems to have read 'Gamphasantes', Byz. s. v. read 'Garamantes'. Others (e. g. Blakesley) suppose that H. here confuses the hunted Troglodytes of 183. 4 with their hunters; but this credits him gratuitously with a blunder. lo/fous kei/rontai. There is some resemblance between the names and the hair-dressing methods of the Macae here, of the Machlyes (180. 1), and of the Maxyes (191. 1). The Libyan Mashuasha play a great part in Egyptian history, both as invaders and as mercenaries. The Tuaregs still wear their hair in a crest, shaving the sides of the head (Duveyrier, p. 432). strouqw=n. In vii. 70. 2 the Asiatic Ethiopians use cranes' wings as 'ostrich' wings are used here; this bird is now rare in North Africa, but Rohlfs found traces of it in this region (K. pp. 91, 149). *ki=nuy. H. describes the territory of Kinyps at length in c. 198, where he compares its fertility to that of Babylonia; it became proverbial (cf. Ovid, ex Pont. ii. 7. 25). Hence the Greeks tried to colonize it (v. 42. 3) but failed. The river is identified with the Wad El Kh\u00e1han (Beechey, p. 62 seq.), east of Leptis, which has some pretensions to the title of river. It was thought to rise only about four miles from the sea, and H.'s distance (over twenty miles) was explained by coast subsidence; for this cf. Beechey, p. 272, 'We have already observed the sea appears to have made great advances on the whole line of coast of North Africa,' and Hogarth, A. A. L. p. 138. Later exploration, however (G. J. ix. 633), shows that the river rose further inland, and so confirms H.'s figure. perisfu/ria. A similar custom is described by Marco Polo in Thibet (ii. 45, cf. p. 48); it also prevailed in Lydia (Aelian, V. H. iv. 1); cf. Westermarck, p. 81. *awtofa/goi. The tribal name has been displaced by the descriptive 'Lotophagi'; probably the 'Lotus-eaters' are really (in whole or in part) the Giridanes, who are mentioned by no other ancient geographer except Stephen of Byzantium, following H. Pliny (v. 28) calls the 'Lotus-eaters' Machroae, of which name some think H.'s *ma/xlues (c. 178) a blundering corruption. H. is precise in describing the lotus, because of its legendary fame in Homer (Od. ix. 84 seq.) as causing forgetfulness of home and family; Polybius (xii. 2) describes it even more fully. It is a species of thorn tree, the jujube (Zizyphus vulgaris) of the genus Rhamnaceae, to which the English buckthorn belongs, with a fruit like a plum in size and shape, which is eaten, especially when dried. The Egyptian lotus (ii. 92. 2 n.) is quite distinct. See Rawlinson ad loc. for six different kinds of lotus. A sort of wine is still made from the fruit. The sxi=nos is the lentisk tree. e)pi\\ potamo\\n me/gan. The geography of this passage cannot be reconciled with existing features; there is no great river or lake such as H. describes. For a full discussion of the passages as to Lake Tritonis, and the identifications proposed for it, cf. R. Neumann, pp. 28-59. The following points may be especially noticed: (1) H.'s own account is inconsistent; Tritonis is a lake, cf. 180. 3 peria/gousi th\\n li/mnhn ku/klw|; yet it is also part of the sea, for Jason runs aground in it before he sees land (179. 2). (2) H. knows nothing of the trend of the coast north here (cf. 181 n.) or of the Little Syrtis (Gulf of Gabes). (3) While Scylax (110 ad fin.) roughly agrees with H. as to the position of the lake, Diodorus, in his story of the Amazons (iii. 53 seq.), transplants it far to the west near the ocean, while Strabo (836) moves it east into Cyrenaica. (4) Probably the original of Lake Tritonis is Lake Faroon, a large shallow expanse, west of the Gulf of Gabes. H.'s informants knew of its existence, but let their fancy fill in the details; later, when under Roman rule this coast became better known, 'the story of Lake Tritonis went on its travels' again (R. Neumann, p. 58). WeldBlundell (B. S. A. ii. 114-18) thinks 'the legend records a commonplace physical fact', i. e. 'a north wind piling up the water on these shoal coasts'. He discusses the whole subject, and inclines to put Lake Tritonis rather more north than Neumann\u2014viz. off the Gulf of Hammamet. *aakedaimoni/oisi. It seems natural to connect the lo/gion here with the attempt on Cinyps (cf. 175. 2), which failed because it had no oracular support. There was still a party of 'extension' at Sparta at the end of the sixth century B. C. Cf. the still more ambitious oracle in 179. 3, which being unfulfilled (as Macan well says), shows that 'all oracles are not to be dismissed as post eventum'. *)ih/sona. Jason is brought to Lake Tritonis on his return journey by Pindar (Pyth. iv. 44), when the Argo had been carried overland from the ocean twelve days. For other variants of the story cf. 150. 2 n. o(rth=|. H. here gives a very curious and interesting account of a native festival. K. O. M\u00fcller thought the worship a Greek one, introduced by Minyan colonists from the neighbourhood of Lake Copais (Orchom. p. 355), but H. clearly conceives it as non-Greek. Macan well suggests that the armed Athene may be a LibyPhoenician goddess, a sort of armed Astarte (cf. i. 105. 2 n.). There is no doubt that the armed maiden personified the goddess. For the test of virginity (yeudoparqe/nous) cf. the mediaeval theory of the ordeal; e. g. Emma, mother of Edward the Confessor, was said to have cleared herself of a charge of impropriety by walking over hot ploughshares (Freeman, Norman Conq. ii. 585 f.). For harmless wounds in a sacred fight cf. ii. 63. 3. a)po\\ . . . *ai)gu/ptou. H., as usual, gives Egypt priority. Plato (Tim. 24 B) also thought the Greeks borrowed their armour, shield, and helm from Egypt; but the monuments do not confirm this view. For H.'s views on the history of armour cf. i. 171 nn.; he certainly was not a specialist on the subject; here he uses kune/h, the low cap of skin (galea), and kra/nos, the metal helmet (cassis) with visor, as if they were identical. It was the kra/nos that was Corinthian. e)pi/koinon. For entire promiscuity cf. Arist. Pol. ii. 3. 9 (1262 a). The rest of the digression on North Africa is skilfully varied in arrangement. cc. 181-5 give a geographical account of the line of oases, cc. 186-90 of the customs of these 'wandering' Libyans between Egypt and Lake Tritonis, cc. 191-6 contain miscellaneous information of great interest as to Libya west of the river Triton, cc. 197-9 general remarks on North Africa. The description of North Africa as a triple zone of varying character is a typical instance of H.'s merits and defects as a geographer; for it cf. c. 174 and ii. 32. 4 seq. The Arabs still divide North Africa into the Tell, the B\u00e9l\u00e2d el Dj\u00e9rid ('the date region'), and the Sahara, and St. Martin (p. 16) says 'it is impossible to describe in a way more exact and complete (than that of H.) the successive belts which extend inland along the coast'. The merits of the division are that it roughly corresponds to marked natural features, and that, in the absence of maps, it coordinates details into a general conception. The coast line of Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli is on the whole fertile, while the region behind (the 'land of dates') is full of wild beasts, especially in the west. H. knows this difference (191. 2). He does not expressly mention that the west is hilly, but he casually speaks of ta\\ o)/rh in c. 194. The description seems to be a Carthaginian generalization, for it applies to the west far more than to the east. Its defects are obvious. (1) The zones are too continuous and symmetrical (cf. H.'s own correction in 191. 3). (2) H.'s 'ridge of sand' between the 'beast region' and the 'desert' proper is a figment; the 'desert' slopes away direct from the mountain block. (3) H. has no conception of the extension of West Africa to the north; Tunis is about 6\u00b0 north of Alexandria. Hence he makes a parallel from Thebes to the Pillars of Hercules. (4) He confuses the caravan route from Thebes with that from Memphis, 300 miles to the north. (5) His oases are far too regular in their intervals. No doubt the symmetry is due to H.'s informants, who were describing to him a familiar caravan route (Heeren); so Idrisi (an Arab geographer of the twelfth century) gives the same figure. H. knows his distances are approximate (ma/lista), but he goes on as if they were precise. a(lo\\s . . . tru/fea. H. is right as to the abundance of salt, rising 'in masses' above the ground, and as to the springs of fresh water in the midst of it. But his general conception of an oasis as a 'hill of salt' (kolwno\\s a(lo/s, 182. 1) is quite absurd; no doubt he was misled by the fact that salt then, as now, is a most important article in the caravan trade; but he attempts to combine in an imaginary picture details that he has not seen, and naturally he fails. H. only knows *)/oasis as a proper name (iii. 26. 1 n.). a)nakonti/zei, 'shoots up.' R. Neumann (p. 87) well points out that the springs in the oases are 'very frequently artificially arranged'. *)ammw/nioi. The Oasis of Siwah (i. e. of Ammon) is twenty days' journey from Thebes (not 'ten'), twelve from Memphis; the latter place was the usual starting-point for a caravan, and H. gives in round numbers the average length of a journey. But his religious instinct made him substitute 'Thebes' for 'Memphis', as the 'ramheaded' Zeus (ii. 42 nn.) is to him the god of Thebes. This is the most natural explanation of his mistake; others (Stein) suppose that a stage of the caravan journey has fallen out, the 'Great Oasis' (El Khargeh), seven days from Thebes. Others again (e. g. R. Neumann, p. 99, who discusses the question fully), think there is a confusion between the great shrine of Ammon at Siwah and a less important one at Dachel, which really 'ten days' journey' from Thebes. a)/llo sfi u(/dwr. Macan (ad loc.) has an interesting note on H.'s marks of time, of which there are seven here, cf. iii. 104. 2 n. The 'spring of the sun' (cf. Arr. Anab. iii. 4; Lucret. vi. 848 seq.) has been identified near the temple; it is a volcanic spring, hence the appearance of boiling (ze/ei, \u00a7 4) from sulphureous bubbles, the water is naturally warm, but feels cooler by day from contrast to the air. H.'s informants have exaggerated a misunderstood natural phenomenon into a marvel. For Augila cf. c. 172 n. Rawlinson (ad loc.) quotes, from Wilkinson, a description of a similar spring in the Little Oasis. dia\\ de/ka h(mere/wn. H.'s measurements are again too small; it is twenty days' journey from Audschila to Fezzan. On the other hand, the distance to the Lotophagi on the north coast (thirty days) is accurate; the reason is that in H.'s day, as now, Fezzan was a wellknown place of trade, the starting-point for the caravans across the Sahara. o)pisqono/moi bo/es. This traveller's tale is told also by Pliny (viii. 178) and other ancient writers; cf. B\u00e4hr ad loc. for references. Is it possible that its explanation is to be found in the rock-drawings, found by G. Nachtigal (Sahara, 1879, i. 307) to the south of Fezzan, and by Duveyrier among the north-east Tuaregs, representing oxen with projecting horns being dragged unwillingly forward? H. is right as to the quality of the hides, which, perhaps, appeals to him as a merchant. trwglodu/tas. There were other Troglodytes on the Red Sea (Strabo 786) and also on the western ocean (Hanno, 7, in G. G. M. i. 6); their mode of life is characteristic of oppressed remnants of primitive races in various parts. The Troglodytes here are the 'Tibboos'; for their swiftness of foot and the slave hunts of the Arabs among them cf. Lyon, Travels in North Africa, 1818-20, pp. 254-5. As strict Mahometans, they do not now eat the vermin here described by H.; but all accounts agree as to the scantiness of their food supply. Nachtigal (u. s. i. 266) found cave-dwellings such as H. describes. *)ata/rantes. The MSS. read Atlantes, which is obviously wrong. Salmasius restored Atarantes from Rhianus (in Eustathius ad Dionysii Orbis Desc. v. 66). H. seems to continue his description westwards (185. 1), but what tribe he means by the Atarantes it is impossible to say. His story as to their being 'nameless' is probably a misunderstood echo of the African dread of magic; the name is regarded as a vital part of a man (Frazer, G. B. i. 404). Hence the care lest it should be known. For unwillingness to utter names cf. Tylor, Early History of Mankind, p. 139 seq. u(perba/llonti, 'if excessively hot.' katarw=ntai. Strabo (822) tells the same story of an Ethiopian tribe; cf. 94. 4 n. *)/atlas. H. (or his informant) has blended the Greek tradition (cf. ii. 33. 3n.) as to the giant, with vague knowledge of the mountain-block of the Atlas, which runs half across North Africa, from Morocco to the lesser Syrtis. The 'Pillar of Heaven' may be a native idea, but it looks suspiciously Greek (cf. Aesch. P.V. 351, and Pind. Pyth. i. 19, of Etna). e)/myuxon ou)de/n. The purely vegetable diet of the Atlantes is an exaggerated generalization from the fact that the North Africans live mainly on dates and meal. a(lo\\s me/tallon. H. knows the coast extends beyond the Straits of Gibraltar. His symmetry has such a hold of him that he projects his scheme of decimally recurring oases far beyond his real knowledge, over the whole sand ridge to the Atlantic. Others, e. g. B\u00e4hr, think the words e)/sti de\\ . . . oi)ke/ontes refer to one more oasis ten days west of the Atlantes; the singular, me/tallon, favours this view, but it is less probable as a whole. In either case, the a(lo\\s me/tallon here = the a(lo\\s kolwno/s (sup.). oi)ki/a. Houses of salt are still found in North Africa, cf. J. Hamilton ('Wanderings', 1856, p. 294); he, like H., accounts for the use of this material by the rainless climate. Shaw (i. 250) speaks of houses washed down by rain. Rohlfs (K. 269) actually advises travellers to provide themselves with water 'to open graves' built of 'Erdsalzklumpen'. The varying colour of the salt, purple, white, and blue, is also confirmed by modern travellers, e. g. Shaw (i. 271), speaking of a mountain in Tunis, near the lake of Marks. Rain apparently does fall at intervals of five years or more, but Humboldt (Aspects of Nature, p. 3) gives the same sweeping denial as H., 'neither dew nor rain bathe these desolate plains' (in North Africa). e)/rhmos ktl. The accumulation of adjectives well expresses the vastness of the Sahara, although (literally speaking) 'water, wood, and animal life' are found in parts of it. noma/des. The general description of customs naturally ignores such exceptions as cc. 177, 184 (the Atlantes). H., however, is too absolute; round Cyrene, at any rate, the natives were cultivators. bow=n . . . qhle/wn. This evidence for Greek with natives is interesting (cf. c. 145 n.); Barca is even more mixed in population than Cyrene. For the pig as a racial criterion in Asia Minor cf. Ramsay, H.

Here again (as in 186. 1) H. generalizes from insufficient evidence; the Numidians subject to Carthage on the coast were agricultural, but inland they were still nomadic. kai/ousi. Cauterization is a frequent remedy among primitive tribes; cf. Hippocrates peri\\ a)e/rwn 20, of the Scyths 'whose bellies are full of moisture'; Layard quotes it in Mesopotamia (N. and B. p. 291); and Denham calls it 'the sovereign Arab remedy for almost every disorder' in Africa (Travels, i. 173); cf. B\u00e4hr ad loc. for other instances. The Libyans are unique in applying it to the temples by burning 'greasy wool'; but perhaps H. was unfamiliar with cauterization in any form. According to ancient medical theory there were four 'humours' in the human body, ai=(ma, u(/dwr, xolh/, and fle/lma (cf. Hippocrates, i. 374 ed. K\u00fchn); the last caused all kinds of catarrh. u(gihro/tatoi. H. gives another reason for Libyan health in ii. 77. 3, i. e. the uniform seasons. Duveyrier (p. 429) says the Tuaregs usually live to be eighty, and sometimes much longer. If these figures be accurate, it simply means that the hard life kills off all the weaklings early. a)postre/fousi, 'they bend back the neck' (for the knife). R. Neumann (p. 136) thinks the piece was thrown over the tent, to bring it under the protection of the god. *poseide/wni. H., in ii. 50. 2, when deriving the names of most Greek gods from Egypt, makes that of Poseidon to be Libyan. It is natural to connect this derivation with the Minyan element at Cyrene; Farnell (C. G. S. iv. 27) says, 'Wherever the worship of Poseidon is prominent, we find either a Thessalian-Minyan or an Ionic influence'; the Minyans, who are prominent all through the story of the foundation of Cyrene, not unnaturally pretended that their cult-god was there before them. H., in this chapter and the next, adopts the theories of North African origins in their extremest form (v. i.); the fact that he gives them this exaggerated value goes far to prove that he heard them on the spot. e)k tw=n *aibusse/wn. H. as usual (cf. ii. pass.) assigns a foreign origin to Greek usages; here he derives the dress of the Palladia. the 'cry' in worship, and the use of four-horse chariots from Libyan sources. The only argument advanced (\u00a7 2) is etymological, and the only point that can be accepted is that there had been much intermixture, and so mutual influence, between Greek settlers and Libyans (cf. c. 145 n.). e)sqh/s, as distinguished from ai)gi/s, is the pe/plos; H. is probably right in saying the Libyan women wore this, and modern travellers speak of 'leather' as frequently worn among the desert tribes, e. g. Lyon (p. 110) of the shirts and kaftans of the Tuaricks (sic). It is also not improbable that the snakes of the ai)li/s were originally 'tassels'. But the resemblance between the Palladia and ai( *aibussai/ was purely accidental, and the etymology is worthless. It is very uncertain whether the connexion between ai)gi/s and ai)/c is more than popular, and in any case the word ai)ge/h is not Libyan, and goats were common elsewhere than in Libya. H. ignores the fact that Zeus (Il. iv. 167) and Apollo (xv. 229), as well as Athene (v. ta\\ de\\ a)/lla ktl.: 'all other points are arranged in the same way' (in the dress of the Libyan women and of Athene). e)reuqeda/nw|. H.'s observation is better than his archaeology; 'vermilion' is still a favourite colour in North Africa. The o)lolugh/ (which is onomatopoetic, cf. Hallelu-jah) was the women's cry, especially in the worship of Athena; cf. Il. vi. 301ai( d' o)lolugh=| pa=sai *)aqh/nh| xei=ras a)ne/sxon, and Xen. An. 3. 19 the women sunwlo/luzon to the soldiers' paia/n. If the Greeks borrowed this anywhere, it would have been from the East; but the ritual cry is a natural instinct of mankind. te/sseras i(/ppous suzeugnu/nai. The statement that the Greeks borrowed the four-horse chariot from Libya has been thought to contradict Homer (Il. viii. 185, xi. 699, and Od. xiii. 81) and Pausanias (v. 8. 7), who puts the first Olympic chariot victory 680 B. C.; but H. may mean that the Greeks learned the practice before 630, when Cyrene was founded. kathme/nous qa/ptousi. The idea was that the soul could not escape if the dying man lay on his back; it would therefore haunt the grave. Rohlfs (K. p. 269) found the dead buried in a sitting posture in the oasis of Taiserbo. For other instances cf. Tylor, P.

For prehistoric migrations of Trojans cf. v. 13. 2 (the Paeonians), vii. 20 n., and Thuc. vi. 2. 3 (the Elymi at Egesta). For possible joint attacks of Libyan and Asiatic tribes on Egypt cf. App. X. 8. to\\ pro\\s e(spe/rhs. H. is quite right as to the contrast between the eastern and the western parts of the North African coast (c. 181 n.). Full discussions of the fauna in this chapter and 192 will be found in B\u00e4hr and (later) in R. Neumann, pp. 152 seq. Of the nine beasts in this chapter, six are right, and the o)/noi can be explained with some probability; the two remaining are monsters (the 'dogheads' and the 'headless') which seem to be more than doubted by H. (v. i.). o)/fies oi( u(permega/qees: the largest python on record is the one that stopped the army of Regulus and had to be killed by the Roman engines (Liv. Ep. 18 'serpens portentosae magnitudinis', cf. too Silius vi. 140 f.). Pliny (viii. 37) says its skin, brought to Rome, measured 120 feet; but it belongs to the days of prescientific measurements! The largest authentic python is about 30 feet long. le/ontes. H. is right as to the presence of lions and bears. e)le/fantes. Elephants were once common in North Africa (Pliny, N. H. viii. 32, and cf. B\u00e4hr), but the needs of the Carthaginian armaments and of Roman amphitheatres extirpated them north of the desert, even as the modern big-game hunter is extirpating them now all over Africa. H. is the first writer to use 'elephant' (R. Neumann, p. 154). a)spi/des. For the asp cf. ii. 74 n o)/noi. Probably by the horned ass is meant some kind of antelope. kunoke/faloi ktl. Some explain the kunoke/faloi and the a)ke/faloi as monkeys; the 'dog-headed' baboon is found in the mountains of Africa, and the 'headless' might be a kind of ape with its head so sunk in its shoulders that its eyes seemed to be in its breast (Neumann). But it is more probable that these are monsters; so Pliny (v. 46) certainly understood the passage; he says the 'headless' were called 'Blemmyae', and classes them with 'Satyrs, goatfeet', and others. Aeschylus (in Strabo 43) wrote of (cf. note on a)kata/yeustainf. a)/grioi a)/ndres. The 'wild men' are doubtless the 'gorillas', which Hanno (G. G. M. i. 13, circ. 500 B. C.) speaks of on the West Coast of Africa; he brought three skins of females to Carthage. a)kata/yeusta. This passage is most important as a criterion of H.'s credulity. R. Neumann (p. 155; cf. Introd. p. 44) thinks that H. accepts all the creatures of \u00a7 4 as 'beasts', but throws the responsibility for the account of them on the Libyans. But the last three lines seem to deal with 'men', not beasts. It is better, therefore, to suppose that the w(s dh\\ . . . *aibu/wn marks off the kunoke/faloi and the a)ke/faloi as creatures for which H. disclaims any responsibility; he simply reports, and in a)katayeusta/ clearly hints disbelief. At any rate it is significant that the qualifying words do not refer to the a)/grioi a)/ndres, for whose existence there was real evidence at Carthage (i. e. Hanno's, v. s.). Stein well compares Arist. H. A. viii. 28, 606 b; the animals of Africa are polumorfo/tera; hence the proverb ai)ei\\ *aibu/h ferei ti kaino/n. It is instructive to compare Ctesias (Ind. c. 20, p. 252), who gives a long account of the kunoke/faloi; they are a tribe 120,000 strong, who cannot talk, but understand what is said to them! kata\\ tou\\s noma/das. H. is on the whole right in his contrast between the fauna of the East and the West; but the asps and the antelopes are common to both regions (R. Neumann, p. 157). Of the twenty beasts in this chapter Neumann (pp. 157 seq.) identifies all but the bo/rues with more or less confidence. Lyon (pp. 271-2) gives a list of sixteen animals of the Fezzan; of these all but the buffalo (bou/balis\u2014some find this in the b., but v. i.), rat, rabbit, hare, and camel are covered by H.'s list, and the camel was almost certainly introduced much later. Lyon does not mention H.'s wild ass, wild ram, and great lizard; but these are confirmed by other authorities. pu/gargoi. The 'white rump' is in Arist. H. A. ix. 32, 618 b, a kind of eagle; but here (as in Plin. viii. 214) it is an antelope. zorka/des kai\\ bouba/lies are both species of antelope. a)/potoi. That the 'wild asses' never drink is impossible; what is true is that they can live where any other beast would die of thirst. The o)/rus seems to be the antelope leucoryx; the 'arms' of lyres were certainly made of horns. bassa/ria ktl. H. is right as to 'foxes, hyenas, and porcupines'. The krio\\s a)/grios may well be the wild sheep (Musimon tragelaphus) of the Atlas; the di/ktus seems to be a kind of jackal, as also the qw=s. pa/nqhres probably include all the 'big cats' (i. e. leopards, panthers, tiger cats, &c.)

The 'small snakes' (o)/fies smikroi/), as distinguished from the kai\\ u(o\\s a)gri/ou. Aristotle viii. 28, 606 a) repeats this, and Pacho (p. 206) vindicates H. as to the stag; Pliny (N. H. viii. 120) also denies the presence of the 'stag'; as they still are found in only a small region, stags may well have been introduced since the time of H. Although the wild boar proper is unknown, kindred species are found. di/podes. Clearly the 'jerboa', the fore-feet of which are very short.

The e)xineu/s seems to be a 'stiff-haired mouse'. bounoi/, 'hills' (199. 1), is a non-Attic word, found in Sicily as well as at Cyrene, and in later Greek, e. g. in Polyb. (bounw/dhs). galai=. The 'weasels' of Tartessus were ferrets used in rabbit hunting (Strabo 144). The Zaueces are perhaps the predecessors of the Zeugi, from whom part of Roman Africa got its name Zeugitania. *gu/zantes. Steph. Byz. reads 'Byzantes', expressly correcting the spelling of H. They may be represented by 'Byzacium', part of Roman Africa (Plin. v. 24). me/li. For honey making cf. Callatebus in Lydia (vii. 31), where it is made of tamarisk juice and wheat; also i. 193. 4 and Shaw, i. 262, a honey-like drink made from the palm. *ku/rauin is probably Cercina on the Gulf of Cabes, which corresponds in dimensions and in fertility; but it is not diabato/s, nor is gold found there. Niebuhr supposes that H. meant the island of Cerne in the Atlantic (Hanno 8, G. G. M. i. 7); probably a legend belonging to this latter island has been blended with facts as to Cercina. ei)/h d' a)\\n pa=n. This passage is important for H.'s use of evidence. He (rightly) does not consider the evidence sufficient to prove that gold dust is skimmed from a pool. But 'anything may happen' in remote places, as well as 'in long periods of time' (v. 9. 3). Hence he tentatively suggests the analogy of pitch 'skimmed' at Zante. e)n *zaku/nqw|. For the tar wells of Zante cf. E. Dodwell (Tour in Greece, 1819). He (pp. 81-2) says the springs are some twelve miles from the town; the one in use at the time of his visit (1805) was much smaller than that of H.; but near it there is a 'spot with which his description seems in every respect to correspond'. Dodwell further describes the sea as being coloured by the pitch for some distance from the shore (cf. \u00a7 4). Chandler (Travels in Greece, 1776, p. 302) describes the method of obtaining the pitch as being exactly that of H., and Dodwell partly confirms this. au)to\\s e)gw/. H. probably went to Zacynthus on his way to Thurii. a)mei/nw. H. speaks with a traveller's (perhaps a merchant's) experience of the various kinds of pitch. Greeks thought the Pierian pitch the best (Plin. xiv. 128); it was made from the forests of Mt. Olympus. Modern experience condemns the tar of Zante. *karxhdo/nioi. This primitive story of silent barter is most interesting; probably the trade took place in the modern Senegambia. Lyon (p. 149) had heard of a precisely similar trade near Timbuctoo, where devils were reported to purchase red cloth with gold dust. For other instances cf. Pliny, N. H. vi. 88 (for silk in Central Asia), St. Martin, p. 329, who gives them from both the fifteenth and the eighteenth century instances, and Miss Kingsley, West African Studies (2nd edit.), p. 204 f. *aibu/wn. H. is speaking of Africa, west of Egypt, which last he rightly considers a separate country; but this does not prove he thought it to be a part of a different continent (cf. 39 nn.). He is quite right in distinguishing the Berber tribes of the North African coast (*ai/bues) from the Negroid races of the S\u00fbd\u00e2n and the Gold Coast (*ai)qi/opes). *dh/mhtros karpo/n.

Hamilton, p. 167 'its ample crops would vie with Egypt, if a moderate amount of labour were expended'. u(yhlota/th. H. here produces the right impression, though his facts are not strictly accurate; Cyrene is the highest part (some 1,800 feet) of the coast region of North-east Africa, which he has in his mind; but the ranges behind, of which he did not know (e. g. Mount Harutch), rise 1,000 feet higher. Pacho, pp. 235-6, says, soup\u00e7on d'exag\u00e9ration'. Hamilton (p. 124) confirms the threefold vintage from his own experience (cf. also Barth. W. 403). H.'s description becomes poetical in its enthusiasm. H. here resumes his narrative from c. 167. o)ru/gmata u(po/gaia. For mining cf. v. 115. 2, vi. 18 (Miletus).

The story of the escapes of Cyrene is full of suspicious elements, the lo/gion, the presence of the admiral (\u00a7 2), the panic (\u00a7 3); nor is it consistent (\u00a7 2) with H.'s view that the Persian expedition aimed at general conquest (c. 145 n.), or with the attack on Euesperides (c. 204). Probably it is a version made up after the fall of the Battiads by Cyrenaean vanity. Menecles (F. H. G. iv. 449, fr. 2) represents Pheretime as having at once established her grandson Battus IV on the throne, and then as subduing a Cyrenaean rebellion with a Persian army. a)naspa/stous. For transplantation of conquered peoples cf. iii. 93. 2 and vi. 3 nn. *baktri/hs. That H. had ever been in Bactria is now believed by no one. It is interesting to contrast the precise details of vi. 119 as to the similar deportation of the Eretrians to Ardericca (near Susa), with the bare and Herod Agrippa (Acts xii. 23) died by the same loathsome disease; the reflection of H. is most characteristic. th=s *ba/ttou. Pheretime was the wife of Battus III (the lame); but the words would naturally mean 'daughter of Battus'. In this case she would be the daughter of Battus II, who came to the throne about 575 B. C., probably as a youngish man; his father only reigned sixteen years (159. 1). H. expressly tells us that kindred marriages were practised by the royal house (164. 4); that Battus III should marry his aunt would be another trace of the native strain in the blood of the Battiadae. The fact that Pheretime herself is of the royal house suits well the prominent part which she plays in the story (165. 1). BOOK V The Persians under Megabazus conquer Thrace. Digressions on the customs and deities of the Thracians (3-8), the lands beyond the Danube (9, 10), on Darius and the Paeonians (11-13), and on the dwellings on Lake Prasias (16). The account of primitive customs makes this section, like the more detailed ones on Scythia and Libya, of the greatest interest to anthropologists. After the excursus on Cyrene and Libya (iv. 145 f.) H. takes up again the narrative of Persian conquest in Europe from iv. 144. *(ellhsponti/wn: in the wide sense; cf. iv. 38 n. Paeonian tribes had once occupied the hill country from the Illyrian mountains to Rhodope, and the valleys of the Axius and Strymon, though it is curious to find them as far east as Perinthus. They were early driven from their homes by Macedonians in the West and Thracians in the East, retaining in H.'s time only the rough upper valleys of the Axius and Strymon (Thuc. ii. 96), and some tracts of land lower down the latter stream; cf. 13-15 and vii. 20. 2 n. The Paeonian dogs were celebrated fighters, Pollux v. 46, 47. For the horses cf. here is a cry of triumph for the victory in the triple duel, thanking the god for his aid. The refrain i)h\\ *paiw/n sounded to the enemy like 'come Paeon', thus fulfilling the oracle, which bade them attack if called by name. Perinthus was a Samian colony founded about 600 B. C., Busolt i. 470. This disaster is clearly placed by H. some time before the Persian conquest. dia\\ th=s *qrhi/khs: i. e. from East to West along the south coast (ch. 10). Darius had already conquered, at least temporarily, the tribes northward along the Euxine as fas as the Ister (iv. 93, 118). me/giston. This undue enlargement of Thrace arises from H.'s misconception of the Danube's course (iv. 99). For Thucydides' variant statements cf. iv. 81. 1 n. ou)no/mata polla/. H. names nineteen tribes: the Bessi (vii. 111), (viii. 116; cf. vii. 115), Bistones 110), Brygi Cicones (vii. 110, &c.), Crestonaei (v. 3, &c), Crobyzi (iv. 49), Dersaei (vii. Dolonci (vi. 34 f.), Edoni (vii. 110, &c.), Getae (iv. 93 f.), Nipsaei (iv. Odomanti (vii. Odrysae (iv. 92), Paeti, Sapaei, Satrae (vii. 110), Scyrmiadae (iv. 93), and Trausi (v. 3). Hecataeus supplies ten additional names and Thucydides (ii. 96) three. Strabo, who says there were only twenty-two tribes in all (331, fr. 47), gives five fresh names, while Pliny (H. N. iv. 43 f.) adds at least twenty to the list. *trausw=n. The Trausi are placed by Livy (xxxviii. 41) round Tempyra (between the Hebrus and Lake Ismaris), and are thought to be connected with the river *trau=os (vii. 109) which flows into the lagoon Bistonis (B\u00e4hr). *krhstwnai/wn (*grhstwni/aThuc. ii. 99, *grhstw=nes Steph. Byz.): the inhabitants of Crestonice, a district round the source of the Echeidorus between the Axius and the Strymon (vii. 124, 127). They belonged to the Thracian race, and during the Persian war were under the same king as the Bisaltae (viii. 116). In the Peloponnesian war part of the tribe lived near Mount Athos (Thuc. iv. 109). Their northern neighbours here may be the Maedi (ch. 9 n.). On the city Creston cf. i. 57 n. This Trausic custom, like Suttee (ch. 5), evidently rests on the faith in a better life beyond the grave, held also by the Getae (iv. 95), and embodied in the Thracian cult of Dionysus (Rohde, Psyche, ii. 1). This belief is primitive and widespread (H. Spencer, Principles of Sociology, ch. 13, 14; Tylor, P. C. ch. 12, 13), while the pessimistic view of the present life (cf. Soph. Oed. Col. 1225; Theogn. 425) is in accord with one side of Hellenic sentiment (Butcher, Gr. G. 154 f.), and with H.'s own oft-repeated opinion (cf. Introd. \u00a7 36). Euripides turns this custom to account, whether he learned it from the work of H. (Stein) or at the Macedonian 27. 78), like the Scyth custom (iv. 71 n.), is based on the belief that the soul requires in another world what it has enjoyed in this. It was widely prevalent among Teutonic and Sclavonic races as well as in India (Diodor. xix. 33, 34; cf. M. Polo, Bk. III, ch. 17, ii. 341; Westermarck, H. of M. p. 125 f.). e)p' e)cagwgh=|: for exportation abroad (cf. vii. 156. 2 ad fin.) like the Circassians. Many races are comparatively indifferent to juvenile unchastity, and only impose strict conduct on women after marriage. Cf. i. 93. 4 n., Peschel, Races of Man, p. 220 f., but per contra, Westermarck, op. cit. p. 61 f. For marriage by purchase cf. the speech of the Thracian chief Seuthes, Westermarck, op. cit. ch. 17. Tattooing was to the Greek the branding of a slave (cf. vii. 233 n.), though traces of it are thought by Tsountas to be indicated on a limestone head found at Mycenae (C. R. xi. 461). It was, however, an honour among the Thracians (Cic. de Offic. ii. 7. 25; Illyrians ii. 10), and the Mosynoeci (Xen. Anab. v. 4. 32). It is widely used, sometimes as a tribal or totem mark (Frazer, Totemism, i. 28, iv. 197 f.), sometimes as a means of decoration (Westermarck, op. cit. p. 168). For the similar feeling among the Germans cf. Tac. Germ. 14 'Nec arare Cf. also ii. 167. The identifications of foreign with Greek or Roman deities, common in classical authors, are usually misleading. In the cases, however, of Ares and Dionysus we have other evidence of their Thracian extraction. Ares, the half-barbarian war-spirit, holds a secondary position in Hellas. Though his cult was very ancient in several places (e. g. Thebes) he was generally thought to have come from Thrace, whence his worship was derived in prehistoric times (Roscher, s. v., Pauly-Wissowa, ii. 642). Dionysus, though the name is probably Greek, had an oracle among the Bessi (vii. 111 n.). His strange cult, prominent features in which are his connexion with the under-world, the orgiastic ecstasy, &c., had no great hold on Greece in the Homeric age, and only won its way to a slow and gradual recognition by becoming Hellenized and humanized. The true home of Dionysus was in Southern Thrace between the Axius and the Hebrus, where he had many local names, e. g. Sabazius. His cult was closely related to the Cybele cult of the kindred Phrygians (Rohde, Psyche, ii. 1; Ramsay on *mh/n, C. and B. i. 105; and in general, Farnell, G. C. v. 85 f.). Artemis (cf. iv. 33) is probably Bendis, worshipped even at Athens (Plat. Rep. i. 1. 327 A; Xen. Hell. ii. 4. 11), or the kindred Edonian war-goddess Cotys or Cotytto (Strabo, p. 470). Both may be connected with the great Mother of Asia Minor, a goddess of fertility of whom the Ephesian Artemis is a form; cf. Append. I and Farnell, G. C. ii. 473 f., 587 f. Hermes appears to have been the chief of the Cabiri (Roscher, Myth. Lex. 2360); with his cult compare the Gallic (Caesar, B. G. vi. 17; Rhys, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 5-20 and ch. iv) and German (Tac. Germ. 9) worship of Mercurius. The latter, Odin, would seem to be like Hermes a wind god, and this may be true also of the Thracian deity. It seems improbable that the Thracians were content with so small a pantheon. Indeed, even according to H., some of them worshipped the Cabiri (ii. 51 n.) and others Salmoxis (iv. 95 n.). eu)wxe/ontai. Such funeral feasts are found among the Scyths (iv. 73) and in Homer (Il. xxiii. 29, xxiv ad fin.). They must be distinguished from merely commemorative festivals, such as the Roman Parentalia, and from the more savage custom of feeding on the dead, for which cf. iv. 26 n. qa/ptousi, like tafai/, refers to all the sepulchral rites detailed later. gh=| kru/yantes defines and explains a)/llws, 'in another way, namely by'. mounomaxi/hs, 'in which the greatest prizes are given, the competitors being matched in pairs' (Macan) (the implied contrast being with the Greek games in which the prizes were small (viii. 26), and more than two competed at once (v. 22)) rather than 'the greatest prizes are given for single combat as is reasonable' (Abbott; cf. viii. 111). a)/peiros: there is no known northern limit. Similarly nothing is known of the country north of Scythia (iv. 16). *sigu/nnas. Apollonius Rhodius (iv. 320) places *si/gunnoi near the island of Peuce in the lower Danube, but Strabo (520), while agreeing closely with H. otherwise, describes *si/ginnoi among the peoples v. 49; vii. 61. Myres interprets this of the trousers (a)nacuri/des), which struck Greeks most in Persian dress, just as the 'braccae' of the Gauls did Latin writers (Anthropological Essays in honour of E. B. Tylor, p. 259). For the ponies cf. Strabo, sup. Similar dwarf horses, 'ginni,' were a regular article of export among the Ligurians (cf. Strabo 202), and can be traced in the region as far back as the fourth century (Arist. Hist. Animal. vi. 24. 1; de Gen. An. ii. 8. 24). *)enetw=n. Eneti, i. e. Veneti, were settled round Padua in the plain between the Adige and the Timavo, and were considered by *)adri/h|, 'on the Adriatic' (cf. i. 163; iv. 33), is added to distinguish them not from the Gallic Veneti (Caes. B. G. ii. 34 f.), who were unknown to Herodotus, but from Homer's Paphlagonian Eneti (Il. ii. 852). In Strabo's time the Adriatic Eneti were regarded as a Cisalpine offshoot of the Breton Veneti or as colonists 195, &c.). *mh/dwn a)/poikoi. Myres (op. cit. p. 260) holds that time will not allow of this Median origin, and suggests a confusion with the *maidoi/ (Thuc, ii. 98, &c.), a Thracian tribe which apparently moved from the middle Strymon to the upper Axius. *li/gues. These Ligurians (cf. vii. 165) are described so as to distinguish them from the Asiatic Ligyes (vii. 72). They once held the coastland as far as the Rhone, but later either submitted to Massilia and the other Greek colonies on the coast or retired up the river valleys and into the Maritime Alps. In the Sigynnae, who trade as pedlars, Myres sees Sequani trading in iron, and especially in iron spears of the gaesum type (op. cit. p. 261 f.). do/rata. and its variants become fairly common. From the 272 f.) is able to identify Sigynnae in this sense with some 'long cylindrical spits' from Tamassos in Cyprus. He would also connect Sigynnae in both senses with the iron-using culture of Hallstatt. me/lissai. Perhaps this refers to the gnats and mosquitos which infest Roumania. For Herodotus' physical speculations cf. iv. 29 n. Darius would hardly have crossed by the Hellespont (cf. iv. 143; v. 26 n.), instead of returning as he came by the Bosporus, if Miltiades, tyrant of the Chersonese, has shown himself disloyal, by his conduct at the bridge over the Danube (iv. 137 f.; cf. vi. 40 n.). th\\n *)hdwnw=n (sc.xw/rhn): cf. cc. 124, 126. The district lay between Lake Cercinitis and Mount Pangaeum, and was rich in timber, gold, and silver (Thuc. iv. 108). After the death of Aristagoras the new city fell into the hands of the Edonians, who still held it in 424 B. C. (Thuc. iv. 107). It cannot therefore be identical with Amphipolis (cf. vii. 114), though it was in the same district. The foundation of the Athenian colony confirms the wisdom of Histiaeus' choice. Strategically it lay at the junction of the only practicable roads from the Nestus to the Strymon (15 n.) and thus commanded the only land route along the northern Aegean, where later ran the great Via Egnatia as well as the route up the Strymon. Coes (cf. iv. 97) was only general of Mitylene in the Scythian expedition. The city still retained, after its submission in the days of Cambyses, the moderate government established by Pittacus (Ar. Pol., p. 1285, 1274 b 18). a)naspa/stous. For such transplantations cf. iii. 93 n. No doubt the Paeonians were deported because they were too dangerous to be left in their native homes. prokatizo/menon: sitting to give judgement, a genuinely oriental habit; cf. i. 14. 97. Nicolaus Damascenus (fr. 71) tells of Alyattes, king of Lydia, and a man from 'Thracian' Mysia and his wife, a story so similar in all its details that E. Meyer (F. i. 168 n.) suspects the variations from H. are due to the carelessness of the excerptor, Constantine Porphyr. (F. H. G. iii. 413). It is, however, more probable that an older Lydian tale was tacked on to Darius erroneously. pepolisme/nh: usually of single cities; cf. ch. 52. 6, iv. 108. 1; here (= oi)kisme/nh) of a country full of cities; cf. Strabo 364. For the supposed Teucrian and Mysian migration to Europe cf. vii. 20 n. tou/tou, 'this' (i. e. that Darius might ask the question). There were two roads from Abdera and the mouth of the Nestus to the Strymon: (1) the main road near the coast south of Mount Pangaeum through Pieria (cf. vii. 121 n.); (2) the mountain road through the passes of the Sapaei (near Philippi), which led north of Mount Pangaeum down the valley of the Angites past the Doberes (vii. 113). *siriopai/ones: named after their capital, Siris (viii. 115) (the modern Seres), near the east bank of the Strymon, just above Lake Cercinitis (now Terkino), into which the Strymon expands above Amphipolis. The Paeoplae are on the Strymon north of the Angites and Siris (vii. 113). *do/bhras *)odoma/ntous. Probably spurious. The combination of geographical and ethnographical boundaries is possible *)aqama=nas kai\\ *do/lopas), the three tribes named only one, the Odomanti, in the hills some way north of Mount Pangaeum, and east of the Strymon (vii. 112; Thuc. ii. 101), is Thracian, while the other two, the Doberes, just north of Mount Pangaeum (vii. 113), and the Agrianes, near the source of the Strymon (Thuc. ii. 96), are themselves Paeonian. How then can Paeonians be said to dwell near them? Lake Prasias is identified by Kiepert (Map xvi, p. 4) with the little lake of Butkova, rather than with that of Do\u00efran, mainly because it lies near the middle Strymon, and possibly lay on the old course of the river. Hence wood could be brought down the river from Mount Orbelus (\u00a7 2), whereas that would be impossible to Lake Do\u00efran. The identification, also, suits better the tribes named (ch. 15) and Mount Dysorus (ch. 17). w(=de and e)caire/ein. Orbelus: the southern Scomius between the Strymon and the Nestus. katapakth=s: neither the form, which should be kataphkth=s, nor the sense, 'fast closed,' are satisfactory. a trap-door; interesting by the fact that mo/ssunos means 'a house built on piles'; cf. Xen. Anab. v. 4. 26. This is the earliest known description of lake dwellings. The settlement here may be a survival of a primitive civilization, like that which existed on the shores of the lakes on both sides the Alps, where many remains of pile dwellings and other relics of the Stone and Bronze ages have been discovered (cf. O. Keller, Lake Dwellings, and the able summary in Lubbock, Prehistoric Times, ch. v, also 'The Glastonbury Lake Village'). They were specially adapted for purposes of defence, and are still so used in Borneo, New Guinea, and Dahomey. For the fishing cf. Rawlinson, and for Thracian polygamy, ch. 5 n. Herodotus seems to imply in the word e)peirh/qh that Megabazus failed in his attempt to capture these inaccessible dwellings. We may compare the escape of Venice when the Huns sacked Aquileia A. D. 452. The story of the Persian embassy to Amyntas. Murder of the envoys by Alexander. The story is hard to believe (Macan). Not only are similar stories told of other persons; Messenians and Laconians (Paus. (Plut. Sol. 8; Polyaen. i. 20), and (later) of the Theban exiles and the Polemarchs (Xen. Hell. v. 4. 4-6; but cf. \u00a7 7); but the subsequent conduct of Alexander is inconsistent with this patriotic beginning. He makes terms with Persia (ch. 21) and remains a Persian vassal (Bks. VIII, IX). This story seems designed to prove the patriotism of Alexander, the faithful friend of Athens (cf. viii. 136 n.; ix. 44); H.'s partiality for the Macedonian kings (cf. ch. 22, viii. 137) leads him to accept the tradition, learnt either in Macedon (cf. Introd. \u00a7 4) or at Athens. *makedoni/hs. H. exaggerates the nearness of Lake Prasias to the Macedon of Amyntas, i. e. the district between the Axius and the Haliacmon (*makedoni/s, vii. 127 n.). Amyntas (circ. 540-498 B. C.; cf. viii. 139), and for a time his son and successor Alexander, were petty princes content to submit to Persian suzerainty. But later (u(/steron tou/twn), after the defeat of Xerxes and Mardonius (480-79 B. C.), Alexander extended his kingdom east of the Axius, over Mygdonia and Bisaltia, till it reached the Strymon (Thuc. ii. 99). He then acquired the rich mine here mentioned, probably just east of Mount Dysorus. Southward of this, in Bisaltia, gold and silver were plentiful (cf. 11 n.; vi. 46; vii. 112; ix. 75). Hence he adopted the Bisaltian type and standard of coinage, merely substituting his own name for that of the tribe (Head, H. N. 199 f.). u(perba/nta: a word like e)/cesti must and Arrian, Anab. iv. 8. and Persians (cf. i. 133; Aelian, Var. Hist. xii. 1) were hard drinkers. no/mos. Repugnant as is the suggestion to Greek sentiment (cf. Isaeus iii. 14) it is even more opposed to Oriental custom; cf. may be an Orientalism: it is used by Alexander the Great of Persian ladies (Plut. Alex. 21). *(/ellhn. Alexander is always made to assert his Hellenic lineage; cf. ch. 22, ix. 45. u(/parxos. The word implies that Macedon is a fief under the Persian crown. *bouba/rh|: dative after dou\\s tau=ta. Bubares, who had a son Amyntas by this marriage (viii. 136), must surely be the same as Bubares, son of Megabazus (vii. 22), one of the overseers of the Athos canal. Since Alexander, not Amyntas, gives Gygaea in marriage, he must in the meantime have succeeded to the throne. But this took place circ. 498 B. C., so that ou) pollw=| u(/steron must not be pressed. Alexander was doubtless anxious to gain influence at the Persian court. It seems more likely that the marriage of his sister to a Persian grandee, which cast a slur on his phil-Hellenism, caused the invention of the tale that he murdered the envoys, than that the murder of the envoys was really hushed up by the marriage. *(/ellhnas ei)=nai. Herodotus, who exaggerates the phil-Hellenism (vii. 173; viii. 143; ix. 44 f.) of Alexander, twice over insists on his Hellenic lineage (viii. 137), yet his proofs are weak: (1) a family legend, au)toi\\ le/gousi (cf. viii. 137 f.); (2) the verdict of the judges at Olympia, probably based on the legend. e)pista/menos. H. may have satisfied himself by inquiry at the Macedonian court, if he visited it (cf. Suidas, Introd. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4), but his 'knowledge' is not different in kind from 'opinion', certainty being attainable in his view, not only by the evidence of his own eyes or other testimony but by inference and combinations (cf. Macan, i, Introd. civ). die/pontes *(ellh/nwn: i. e. the *(ellhnodi/kai, as most edd. read with A B C P. These presidents and judges at the Olympic games were citizens of Elis (ii. 160). Their number varied with that of the Elean tribes (Paus. v. 9. 5, with Frazer ad conqueror of Argos (viii. 137). Thucydides accepts this genealogy (ii. 99, v. 80), as do most later authors, with variations (viii. 137 n.), though Demosthenes vehemently protests (Phil. iii. 31). sta/dion: cognate accusative, the foot-race being a form of Anab. iv. 8. 27; Plat. Laws 833 A. sunece/pipte: not 'was drawn in the first pair', as competitors ran in heats of four, not in pairs (Paus. vi. 13. 2), but 'ran equal with the first', i. e. ran a dead a)llh/lois. The word, used of votes or opinions (i. 206. 3; viii. 49. 2), is transferred here to the competitor voted upon, as in viii. 123. 2 to the voters. Since Alexander's name does not appear on the list of victors, we must either suppose he was beaten in the deciding heat, or that Herodotus here too (cf. 17 n.) is giving us an inaccurate Macedonian version of the story, such athletic traditions being proverbially untrustworthy. Darius takes Histiaeus with him to Susa. Otanes' conquests. dwreh/n must be left out or altered to xw/rhn, and put before misqo/n. No doubt Histiaeus, and Aristagoras after him (ch. 124 f.), hoped to turn the great natural advantages of the district (ch. 11 n.) to good account. But the idea of a great Graeco-barbarian power in Thrace strong enough to be a danger to the Persian empire is strange. oi)khi/w|: either 'within your own land' (cf. Thuc. i. 118), or better, 'of your own making.' su/ssitos=o(mo/sitos (vii. 119. 3), and o(motra/pezos (iii. 132), Xen. Anab. i. 8. 25. This was a great honour at the Persian, as at other Eastern courts (2 Sam. ix. 7, 11; 1 Kings ii. 7). For the king's benefactors cf. viii. 85 n. *)artafre/nea. The MSS. vary here and elsewhere (vi. 94; vii. 74), but this form is confirmed by Aesch. Pers. 21, 776, and C. I. A. i. 64 [*tis]safre/nhn, and represents the Persian ending -frana (cf. iii. 70 nn.) more correctly than the later form *)artafe/rnhs. The mutual relations of the Persian officials in Asia Minor are obscure (cf. App. VI; Abbott, H. v, vi, Exc. i). (1) Though Herodotus divides Asia Minor west of the Halys into three satrapies\u2014the Ionic, the Lydian, and the Phrygian (iii. 90, 127), we hear of only two capitals\u2014Sardis (\u00c7parda, cf. iii. 120) and Dascylium, as in Thucydides. Again, Thucydides clearly recognizes only two principal satraps\u2014Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes, Tamos, governor of Ionia, being a mere lieutenant of the latter (Thuc. viii. 31, 87). Similarly, in Herodotus, Oroetes, Satrap of Sardis (iii. 120), resides at Magnesia in the Ionic satrapy (iii. 122), and after slaying the satrap of Dascylium, holds all three satrapies (iii. 126, 127). Further, had he not from the first ruled Ionia, why should he have been taunted with the independence of Samos? (iii. 120). It would seem then that the Ionic satrapy, though distinct for financial purposes, was governed from Sardis. (2) The generals seem at this time to have been quite distinct from the satraps. In the Ionic revolt the three generals are said to have districts (nomoi/, v. 102), and divide the revolted towns among themselves (v. 116). Nevertheless Daurises moves from the Hellespont to Caria (v. 117), while Hymaees takes his place on the Hellespont (v. 122), and Otanes joins Artaphrenes in attacking Ionia and Aeolis (v. 123). Thus Otanes (never styled governor) would seem to have been a purely military official (vii. 135), successor to Megabazus in the generalship (v. 26), while Artaphrenes is throughout satrap of Sardis (v. 25) with supreme authority (v. 30), especially in matters of finance (vi. 42). Indeed, it is implied (v. 30, 32) that his authority is superior to that of the general; cf. Meyer, iii. \u00a7 43. Lastly, Mardonius (vi. 43) would seem to have had a special commission from the king with fuller powers, as had the younger Cyrus (Xen. Hell. i. 4. 3). dikaste/wn. For the king's judges cf. iii. 14. 5, 31. 3 nn.; and for a similar offence, viii. 194. spadi/cas = e)kdei/ras, 'after below. Stein suggests 'after tanning', spa/dic being the bark of the maple. e)ne/teine, 'stretched them to make the seat'; cf. Il. v. 727, and for to/noi, ix. 118. Flaying was an Assyrian practice (Layard) adopted by the Persians so freely that flaying alive (Diodor. xv. 10; cf. Plut. Art. 17 became known in late times as the Persian punishment. *buzanti/ous. Since Otanes has to reduce Byzantium and Chalcedon, it is clear they had revolted against Darius (cf. 27) after the disaster in Scythia, whither the Byzantines had followed him (iv. 138). This is confirmed by the fact that Darius, who had crossed to Europe over the Bosporus (iv. 85), returned by the Hellespont (v. 11 n.). Perinthus may perhaps be added to the rebels (cf. v. 1). Antandrus and Lamponium were Lesbian colonies north of the gulf of Adramyttium. Apparently they had shaken off the yoke of Mytilene, but were now reconquered and remained later subject; cf. Thuc. iii. 50, iv. 52. Lemnos and Imbros were now first conquered by the Persians with the aid of Coes. For their conquest by Miltiades cf. vi. 137 n., and for Pelasgians there Appendix XV, 1 and 6. The text is plainly faulty. Most editors follow Valckenaer in marking a lacuna after teleuta=|. Stein more ingeniously suggests that the words tou\\s me\\n lipostrati/hs ktl. originally followed ch. 26, with which they are connected both in sense and grammar (cf. vi. 122); the author then added oi( me\\n dh\\ *lh/mnioi . . teleuta=| as a marginal note (cf. ix. 83); finally, when these got thrust into the text, the gloss ai)ti/h . . . katestre/feto was inserted to mend the damaged construction. But this betrays its origin by its inadequacy. In any case it is clear that the last lines of this chapter must be connected with ch. 26. Lycaretus had hoped to succeed his brother Maeandrius at Samos (iii. 143), but the Persians had set up Syloson (iii. 144), whose son was now tyrant there (iv. 138). Causes and outbreak of the Ionic revolt. Naxos and Miletus (28, 29). The expedition to Naxos and the consequences of its failure (30-4). Aristagoras, urged on by Histiaeus, revolts, puts down the tyrants in Ionia, and goes to Sparta for aid (35-8). a)/nesis, 'afterwards there was a respite from evil for no long time.' H. apparently was ignorant of the length of this brief interval of peace. His vagueness on the point makes the chronology of the reign of Darius in general, and of the Scythian expedition in particular, uncertain. to\\ deu/teron. The first occasion would seem to be rather the conquest under Cyrus (i. 161 f.; cf. vi. 32) than the recent operations, which did not affect Ionia. kata\\ to\\n au)to\\n xro/non. Herodotus clearly makes the acme of Milesian prosperity fall in the days of Histiaeus, and synchronize with the prosperity of Naxos (circ. 510 B. C.). The Eusebian list, as given by Jerome, dates her thalassocracy 748-730 B. C. in the supposed era of colonization (cf. Busolt, i. 465 f.), but Myres would transfer it to 604-586 B. C. (J. H. S. xxvi. 110-15), the days of the great tyrant Thrasybulus, Periander's friend and ally (i. 20, v. 92), whose sea-power and greatness H. recognizes. Thrasybulus may have owed his power in part to an uprising of the poor subject Carians, known as Gergithes (Athenaeus, p. 524 a, b), against the dominant Hellenic immigrants. The 'two generations' of faction represent the interval between the two tyrannies, when Miletus and the other Ionic cities made little resistance to Croesus. Yet Miletus would seem to have been fairly prosperous in the days of Cyrus (i. 141). kath/rtisan: to set right that which is out of order, Lat. reconcinnare; cf. 106. 5. The essence of the alleged re-settlement is the re-arrangement of office, just as in that of Demonax at Cyrene (iv. 161) it is the re-arrangement of the tribal divisions. There, too, the arbitration is between parties; for arbitration between cities cf. v. 95; vi. 108; vii. 145, 154. Some see in this re-settlement the establishment of a moderate oligarchy of yeomen farmers; but is not the story a political parable inserted here for some unknown reason? a)nesthkui/h| = a)nasta/tw| e)ou/sh|, 'in the general desolation of country', not 'the upland parts of the country' pa=san th\\n xw/rhn (sup.). kate/bhsan: like kate/rxesqai, used of approaching the city from the country, since the cities generally lay near the sea; cf. i. 114. 4, 138. 1; Hom. Od. xi. 188, xv. 505. a(li/hn: used by Herodotus of Thebes (79. 2), Sparta (vii. 134. 2), and Persia (i. 125. 2). On inscriptions it is found in the Doric West, e. g. Corcyra, Sicily, and Magna Graecia (cf. Gilbert, Gr. S. ii. 309 n. 1). The official term in Ionia was probably a)gora/; cf. vi. 11. 1 (Macan). tw=n paxe/wn. The men of substance; so of Chalcidian Hippobotae (77. 2), and of oligarchs at Aegina (vi. 91. 1), and at Megara in Sicily (vii. 156. 2); cf. also Aristoph. Pax 639. For similar unnatural alliances between an oligarchy and a tyrant cf. Hippias and Sparta (cc. 63, 90, and Thuc. ii. 33). The Milesian oligarchy had been friendly to Paros, the rival of Naxos (ch. 29). o)ktakisxili/hn. A force of 8000 hoplites, as large as that of Sparta (vii. 234), is rightly regarded by Beloch (B. p. 181) as impossible for a rocky island with no large town, unless it includes the contingents of all the Cyclades dependent on Naxos (31. 2). e)piqalassi/wn. There is some was supreme in Western Asia Minor (25 n.). The Persian rule only extended to the islands adjacent to the coast, e. g. Samos. Naxos, though small in comparison with Euboea or Cyprus, is the largest of the Cyclades, 19 miles by 15. It was celebrated for its wine (cf. the wine-cup on its coins, Head, H. N. 488; Hill, G. and R. C. 167), and still produces good corn, oil, wine, and fruit; cf. Bent, Cyclades (ch. xiv); Tozer, Islands of the Aegean, ch. iv. Yet it only sent four ships to Salamis (viii. 46. 3), and never paid more than 6 2/5 talents as tribute to Athens, while its neighbour Paros paid 16 1/5 talents. a)gxou=: quite 100 miles from Miletus, but well placed half way between Ionia and Greece. ta\\s e)k tau/ths h)rthme/nas: implies political as well as geographical connexion. The Cyclades, the summits of a submerged mountain chain, are divided by but narrow channels of water. This Naxian hegemony may possibly have been established by Lygdamis (i. 64) with the aid of Pisistratus and Polycrates (cf. App. xvi); Myres would, however, connect the thalassocracy of Naxos (515-505 B. C.) with the prosperous (ch. 28) commercial oligarchy established after the fall of the tyrant (J. H. S. xxvi. 98). Cyprus, already subject to Persia (iii. 19. 3, 91. 1), is about thrice as large as Euboea. Naturally for an important foreign expedition the king's approval was required, but cf. iv. 167 n. For the genealogy of the Achaemenid royal house of Persia cf. Appendix IV, \u00a7 3. Megabates was satrap of Phrygia when Pausanias, after the capture of Byzantium, entered into treasonable relations with Xerxes (Thuc. i. 128). But, according to Thucydides, the lady to whose hand Pausanias aspired, was the daughter, not of Megabates, but of the king himself. Again, Megabates was replaced by Artabazus to further the conduct of the negotiations. Herodotus is repeating a doubtful oral tradition, while Thucydides based his narrative on Pausanias' own letter, irrefutable evidence, if genuine. Again, Thucydides has not the faintest doubt of Pausanias' guilt, whereas Herodotus, who elsewhere (ix. 76, 78, 88 n.) emphasizes the nobler traits in his character, and minimizes his pride and luxury (viii. 3, ix. 82 n.), evidently regards him as less black than he was painted. On the other hand, to Themistocles (cf. viii. 4 n., Introd. \u00a7 31) Herodotus is less favourable than Thucydides. The wars in Ionia and Greece, from the expedition against Naxos to the battle of Marathon, fall within a period of ten years, 499-490 B. C. The chronology which suits H.'s narrative best is Stein's from whom Abbott (Exc. xiii) varies only as to the first years. 499.Spring. Expedition to Naxos. Four months' siege (v. 31-4).Autumn.

The sending of the heralds (vi. 46, 48 f.).490.The expedition of Datis, and the battle of Marathon (vi. 94 f.). It seems clear that the revolt began with the arrest and deposition of the tyrants, which must therefore be placed in 499 B. C. in the sixth year before the fall of Miletus (494 B. C.; cf. vi. 18). But while the events of the triennium between the fall of Miletus and the battle of Marathon are clearly dated by Herodotus (cf. Macan, App. VI), the chronology of the Ionic revolt is vague, the only fixed point being supplied by Thucydides' statement (iv. 102; cf. ch. 126 n.) that Aristagoras' death took place sixty years before the foundation of Amphipolis. Very possibly Macan is right in cutting down the length of the siege of Miletus to a single year (with E. Curtius) and in allowing a longer period to the revolt in Cyprus and Aeolis. But his scheme (App. V) is rather a correction than an interpretation of Herodotus. Busolt (ii. 548 n. 7) presses into the service of chronology fanciful anecdotes about Darius at Susa, and thus crowds the events above assigned to 498 and 497 into 498, and makes the siege of Miletus last 3 years, 497-4. Munro (C.A.H. iv. 232-3) suspects H.'s curiously explicit chronology of 493-1 B. C. and doubts if any of the events assigned to 491 B. C. are rightly dated. He places Marathon in 491. *kau/kasa must have been a harbour on the south-east coast of Chios (34) near the next expedition (vi. 96). qalami/hs: a port-hole in the lowest row. dielo/ntas kata\\ tou=to, 'dividing him in this way.'

That a Persian of the blood royal should by treachery ruin a project expressly sanctioned by Darius, and to punish the insolence of a Greek tyrant risk disgrace for himself, is unlikely; that he should remain thereafter in high favour (32 n.), hardly credible. Nor are the Naxians, with the fate of Samos, Chios, Lesbos, and Lemnos before their eyes, likely to have been guileless enough to have no suspicions of the great armada gathered against them. e)sa/canto (cf. proesa/canto, i. 190, viii. rather aorist middle from e)sa/gein, in which case kai/ must be struck out.

Herodotus speaks as if this slave were a wellknown character like the man in the iron mask, thus arousing the reader's curiosity; cf. 51. 1, 72. 3; vi. 119. 2; viii. 211, &c. fulassome/nwn: there were vii. 239. 3; Nehemiah ii. 7. Gellius, xvii. 9, adds the professed the message, *(istiai=os *)aristago/ra|: *)iwni/an a)po/sthson: but these details deserve no credit. Grundy (p. 84 f.) sees in this incidental reference to conspirators an indication that the plan of revolt had been made before the expedition to Naxos. He holds that the other conspirators would never have admitted to their councils a tyrant in the Persian interest, who had just been engaged in an attempt to enslave a free Greek island, unless he had been beforehand implicated in the conspiracy: nor could Aristagoras have ventured to ask for aid in European Greece, unless he had some defence to offer for the attack on Naxos. He further points out how improbable it is that Megabates (cf. 33 n.) betrayed the intended expedition to the Naxians, and suggests that Aristagoras was the real culprit. On these and other grounds he forms the hypothesis that the object of Aristagoras in proposing the expedition was to bring about the mobilization and concentration of the Ionian fleet, the only possible means of securing that combination between the Greek cities necessary for the success of a revolt. But, as he admits, proof is impossible. Herodotus, by the inconsistencies and prejudices (97 n., 124 n.; vi. 3 n.) visible in his account, lays himself open to damaging criticism, but the reconstruction proposed has no secure basis. Patriotic Greeks in Ionia or Europe might gladly welcome the man who had seen the error of his ways and renounced Medism and Tyranny. Naxos may have been warned without Aristagoras' intervention, and it is quite after the manner of H. to introduce us suddenly to a fully fledged conspiracy without telling us exactly the steps by which it was formed. In fine, while we may legitimately doubt the fairness and accuracy of H., we have no sufficient grounds for rewriting the whole story. Discontent with the Persian and the tyrant was doubtless rife in Western Asia (ch. 124 n.); the means by which it was brought to a head, and the motives of the agents, remain uncertain.

The opening words take us back to the excursus on Spartan history (i. 65 f.), though incidentally Cleomenes has been already mentioned (iii. 148).

The Ephors were specially charged with the maintenance of the order established by Lycurgus. Hence it may have been part of their duties to guard against the extinction of either royal house (cf. 41. 2). But in this matter the Ephors are clearly acting as the presidents and executive (cf. 39) of the Gerousia. Ephors and Gerousia together formed the supreme criminal court (referred to vi. 72, 82, 85) as described by Paus. iii. 5. 2, with reference to the trial of king Pausanias on his return from Attica executive of this court the Ephors can summon the king before them (Plut.

Bigamy was illegal throughout Greece; but the curious arrangements at Sparta (Polyb. xii. 6 b) by which (1) several brothers married one wife (cf. de Coulanges, Nouv.

As in England, great officers of state are on occasion of a birth summoned to the queen's apartments. For the neglect of this precaution at the time of the birth of the 'Old Pretender' cf.

The Spartans had to watch over the purity of the Heracleid race, through whom came their title to their territory. *dhmarme/nou: probably a son of the famous Chilon (i. 59 n.; vi. 65. 2). translation 'very mad' (cf. a)krodi/kaios, a)kropenqh/s, a)kro/sofos) is impossible in view of vi. 75, 84, which show that Cleomenes was at first u(pomargo/teros, and only at the end of his life downright mad. ou)/te xrhsa/menos. Cf. Cic. de Thuc. iii. 92). Greek states as a rule procured the sanction of an oracle before founding a colony or undertaking a war. As the pronouncement of Pope Alexander VI legalized the Spanish and Portuguese occupation of America, so the oracle gave the Greek colonists assurance of success and a title to the land. But the oracle here, as elsewhere, acted on the suggestion of others, being in most cases set in motion by the state or men interested in the project; cf. iv. 159 n., and Holm, G. i. 244 f. (See note, p. 415.) tw=n nomizome/nwn. Cf. Thuc. i. 24 with Forbes, ad loc., and for the kindling of the Prytaneum fire in the colony from that in the mother-city i. 146. kathge/onto.

For Macae cf. iv. 175, and Cinyps, iv. 175, 198 n. Eleon, in Boeotia near Tanagra, was the home of the legendary seer Bacis (viii. 20 n.). *lai+/ou: perhaps 'oracles referring to Laius'; Soph. Oed. qe/sfata, but more probably 'collected by Laius'. Antichares was probably a xrhsmolo/gos (vii. 6. 3 n.), who made use of an apocryphal collection of oracles passing in the sixth century under Laius's name, and similar to those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, and Bacis (vii. 6; viii. 20). For an inscription supposed to be of the time of Laius cf. v. 59 n. *(hraklei/hn. If taken of a town, the article (as in i. 16) would imply an existing city, made a Greek colony by Dorieus, but in spite of Diodorus (iv. 23 *dwrieu\\s e)/ktise po/lin *(hra/kleian), there was clearly no such city near Mount Eryx (cf. 45. 1 ad fin., 46. 1), Heraclea Minoa lying on the south coast (46. 2). Probably gh=n has fallen out before th/n, then *)eruki/nh xw/rh (cf. 45. 1 ad fin.). The claim of the Heracleid prince to the land of Heracles is similar to the Dorians' title to the Peloponnese, but in Sicily the claim is vitiated by the fact that the Heracles of Mount Eryx is no Greek hero but Tyrian Melkart (cf. ii. 44), accepted like Astarte-Aphrodite by the Elymi from their Phoenician neighbours. The general identification of Heracles with Melkart and Astarte with Aphrodite is, however, without sufficient grounds. The Italy of Herodotus (cf. iv. 15. 1; vi. 127. 1) does not on the west coast extend to the north of the river Laus, Hyele (Velia) being in Oenotria (i. 167. 3): but it takes in all the Greek cities on the gulf of Tarentum, including Tarentum itself (i. 24. 1; iii. 136, 138) which Antiochus excluded. On Italy in this and other senses cf. Nissen, Italische Landeskunde, i. ch. 1. to\\n B. C. (Diodor. xii. 9). *subari=tai. These are the remnants of the inhabitants of Old Sybaris, who dwelt in Laus and Scidrus (510-453 B. C.; cf. vi. n.); their descendants settled at New Sybaris, 453-448, 445-444, and finally at Thurii (443 B. C.), where H. doubtless learned the story. Telys is called basileu/s in the Sybarite, but tu/rannos in the Crotoniate story. Freeman (S. ii. 434-5) holds that basileu/s is used of tyrants only by those who wished to flatter them (cf. vii. 161 n., vi. 23 n.), but in ch. 113 Aristocyprus and Philocyprus of Soli are called indifferently king and tyrant, and in ch. 9) who having obtained supreme power at Sybaris, banished 500 leading citizens. These took refuge at Croton, which, led by Pythagoras, refused to surrender the suppliants, whereupon Telys declared war and marched on Croton with an army 300,000 strong (Strabo 263). It is curious that H. does not regard the fall of Sybaris as a judgement on the Achaeans for driving out their Troezenian fellow colonists. Ar. Pol. v. 3. 1 n. martu/ria. The citing of the evidence on both sides is an interesting advance on H.'s usual practice of merely giving both stories (cf. Introduction, \u00a7 27). The positive evidence alleged by Sybaris would in itself outweigh the negative proofs of Croton (Freeman, S. ii. 91). But it is noticeable that H. apparently has not seen the shrine by the Crathis (contrast of Dorieus with the campaign is best regarded as an attempt on the part of the oracle to justify the failure of its prediction that he would succeed. For a similar unsuccessful Delphic crusade for Hellenism in the West, followed by a similar excuse, cf. i. 165, 167 nn. to\\n chro\\n *kra=qin, 'the dry bed of the Crathis'. Sybaris lay between two streams, the Crathis (cf. i. 145 n.) and its tributary the Sybaris. The Crotoniates, when they destroyed the city, diverted the Crathis on to the site so as to destroy all the buildings (Strabo 263). Cf. also Diod. xi. 90; 290. toi=si a)pogo/noisi. This is put in merely to contrast with *kalli/ew a)po/gonoi. Dorieus had certainly no descendants at Croton, even if Euryanax (ix. 10. 3) be his son. *foini/kwn: Poenorum (cf. iv. 197), i. e. the men of Carthage or of the Phoenician colonies in Sicily, now under her leadership. Segesta, a city of the Elymi, is as usual ready to help fellow barbarians against the intruding Hellenes (Thuc. vi. 2; Freeman, S. i. 200 f.). *minw/hn. Tradition alleged that this town at the mouth of the Halycus had been founded by the Cretans, when Minos came to Sicily (cf. vii. 170 n.). The name Minoa, however, might well have been given it later by the Cretan colonists of Gela, or by the Megarians of Selinus (Thuc. vi. 4), Minos and Minoa being closely connected with Megara (Thuc. iii. 51). The name Makara (Heracl. Pont. F. H. G. ii. 220) may point to an early Phoenician settlement under the protection of Melkart (ch. 43 n.), the Tyrian Heracles. This conjecture would be confirmed if the inscription, Ras Melkart, on a series of Sicilian coins struck under Carthaginian rule (circ. 409-241 B. C.) could be referred to Heraclea Minoa, but Holm (S. iii. 674), now followed by Head (H. N. p. 136), interprets it of Cephaloedium, since Ras = kefalh/ = headland. The name Heraclea might be a translation of Makara, or it may have been given to the city by the Spartan colonists, to signify that here was the promised land of the oracle (ch. 43). This and similar details (ch. 47; vi. 17 n.; vii. 153, &c.) seem to indicate that H. collected materials in Sicily. oi)khi/h|. Cf. Cleinias at Artemisium, viii. 17. i(la/skontai. On the worship of heroes cf. Rohde, Psyche, i. 146 f., and for passages illustrating it Abbott, Exc. XII. Heroic honours are paid to mere men, to oekists of colonies, Timesius at Abdera (i. 168), Miltiades in the Chersonese (vi. 38), Hagnon and subsequently Brasidas Amphipolis (Thuc. v. 11); cf. also Diod. xi. 66; Xen. Hell. vii. 3. 12. More strictly analogous are the cases where worship is paid to enemies at the bidding of an oracle, to Onesilus at Amathus (v. 114) and to Artachaees at Acanthus (vii. 117) for his great stature. For the effect of beauty and athletic powers on the Greek we may compare the case of Masistius (ix. 25) and the pardon of Dorieus at Athens (Xen. Hell. i. 5. 19; Paus. vi. 7. 4). The case of Philippus is the more remarkable as the men of Segesta were enemies and barbarians, though, as is shown by their coinage and the remains of the temple and theatre there, Hellenic in culture. On hero-worship cf. Farnell, Greek Hero Cults. For H.'s curious error as to the length of Cleomenes' reign cf.

Aristagoras fails to persuade or bribe Cleomenes to march on Susa. Map and description of the countries between Sardis and Susa. The Royal Road. The project of marching on Susa and conquering Asia is an anachronism (cf. Cleomenes, Appendix XVII, \u00a7 3). Can it have come from the phil-Hellenic deserter Zopyrus? (cf. iii. 160 n. and J. H. S. xxvii. 37). w(s *lakedaimo/nioi. The story of the exhibition of the map and of the private interview with Cleomenes may perhaps come indirectly from Gorgo herself, since H. seems specially well informed about her: but the speech of Aristagoras is in the main a lively version of the official Persian itinerary (cf. 52). xa/lkeon pi/naka. The oldest Greek map, that of Anaximander of Miletus, marks an epoch in Greek geography (H. Berger, i. 1 f.; Bunbury, i. 122, 145). Hecataeus is said to have made great improvements in this map, but it would rather seem that he merely corrected Anaximander's errors in his perio/dos gh=s, if indeed that work be his (cf. Introd. \u00a7 20). Cf. exhibited that great scheme of Ionian geography rather unjustly ridiculed by Herodotus (iv. 36). For an ingenious reconstruction of such maps cf. Myres, R. G. S.

Compared with the Dorian hoplite, with his brazen helmet, cuirass and greaves, and great shield, his sword and 8 ft. spear, the Persians might fairly be called light-armed bowmen (cf. Aesch. Pers. 239, 40, and ix. 62), even if some had coats of mail (viii. 113, ix. 22). For Persian arms and the kurbasi/h cf. vii. 61 n. poluargurw/tatoi: rich, not in silver but in money, a sense common in compounds, though rare for a)/rguros itself (cf. ii. 121 a). Both Croesus (i. 69; vi. 125) and Pythius (vii. 28) were rich in gold, since the Pactolus brought down gold-dust from Mount Tmolus (i. 93. 1; v. 101). The mines there and on Mount Sipylus furnished electrum also (cf. i. Arist. Av. 493; and now Angora wool. especially in vines. Cf. Il. iii. 184*frugi/hn ei)sh/luqon a)mpelo/essan. For Cappadocians cf. i. 72 n.; vii. 72, and for the Cilician tribute iii. 90. 3. For Matieni cf. 52. 5; i. 72 n., 189. 1, and for Cissia iii. 91. 4; vi. 'well known to you'. Apparently towns were not marked on the map; cf. \u00a7 1. Though Xenophon (cf. Anab. iii. 5. 15; Cyrop. viii. 6. 22) makes the Persian king reside in Susa only three months in spring, and at Ecbatana two in summer, leaving seven winter months for Babylon, Jew (cf. Nehem. i. 1; Esther i. 2; Dan. viii. 2) and Greek (cf. iii. 70; Aesch. Persae pass., Ctesias) alike rightly regarded Susa as the capital and chief palace of the Great King. There Darius built a palace, restored after a fire by Artax<*>rxes Mnemon, which resembles that of Xerxes at Persepolis (cf. Dieulafoy, Acropole de la Suse, L'art Chipiez, vol. N\u00f6ldeke, Persepolis). Susa was also the principal treasury (Strab. 735, cf. 731; Arr. An. iii. 16), though there was also great treasure at Persepolis (Diod. xvii. 71; Strab. 730), and a smaller amount at Pasargadae (Arr. iii. 18) and Ecbatana (Arr. iii. 19). a)naba/llesqai, 'ought you not to put off?'

For Messenians cf. iii. 47; for Arcadians, i. 66 f.; for Argives, i. 82; vi. 76 f. Cleomenes had called on the Ephors to expel Maeandrius (iii. 148); here he apparently dismisses Aristagoras on his authority; but cf. Appendix XVII, \u00a7 2. i(kethri/hn: suppliants, who were inviolable and secure of a hearing, bore branches of olive wreathed with wool (cf. vii. 141. 1), as in the opening scenes of the Iliad and the Oedipus Rex. Cleomenes seems less proof against corruption than fifteen years before (iii. 148), but Gorgo's precocious cleverness has its counterpart in her later wisdom (vii. 239). e)pi\\ ple/on: in greater detail (cf. ii. 171. 1), such as is given in the next chapters. The description of this 'Royal road' may come directly, like the map of Aristagoras, from some Ionian geographer, but the distances, in parasangs and stages (cf. Xen. Anab. i. 2 f.; Ctesias, Pers. \u00a7 64, p. 80), must be derived from some official Persian document. Roads of this kind united all the provinces of the empire with its centre Susa. Their importance was rather military and political than commercial, hence they were guarded at important points by forts and garrisons (\u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; cf. 35. 3 n.), and studded at intervals of a day's caravan journey (i. e. three to five parasangs), not only with khans or caravanserais (katagwgai/, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6) but also with royal post stations (staqmoi/, cf. a)/ggaroi, viii. 98). For the Great Khan's roads with 'sjambs', i. e. Horse-post houses or stations on them at every twenty-five to thirty miles, cf. M. Polo, Bk. II, ch. 26, i. 433 f. The general descriptions of such roads by Ctesias (loc. cit.) and Amyntas (Athen. 529 e) are lost; Xenophon (Anab. i, ch. 2 and 4) gives details about one, which, unlike that of Herodotus, kept south of the great salt-desert (cf. \u00a7 1 n., ch. 54 n.). But the Royal road here from Sardis to Susa is far older than the Persian empire. Its immense d\u00e9tour to the north between Sardis and the Euphrates, and the fact that Sinope not Amisos was in early times the terminus of the caravan-route from the East to the Euxine, point unmistakably (Ramsay, A. M. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3) to the existence of a great capital at Pteria [Boghaz-Keui; cf. i. 76 n. and for recent discoveries there E. Meyer, i, \u00a7\u00a7 474, 478 f.; Hogarth, Ionia and the East, ch. 4]. To connect this Hittite capital in Cappadocia with Sardis and the Aegean on the one hand, and with Assyria and Babylon on the other, was the original purpose of the roads which later formed the 'Royal road'. (See note, p. 415.) From Sardis to the Halys, through Lydia and Phrygia, is reckoned at 94 1/2 paras. = 2,835 stades. This distance agrees fairly with the route sketched by Ramsay (op. cit.), amplifying and improving on Kiepert Berl. 1857). The would be by Satala to Akmonia, or to Keramon Agora. Then to avoid the salt-desert, which spreads over the centre of the peninsula (cf. \u00a7 1 dia\\ oi)keome/nhs te h( o(do\\s a(/pasa kai\\ a)sfale/os), road northward by the city of Midas, Pessinus, and Gordium to Ancyra (cf. J. H. S. xix, p. 50 and map) and the bridge over the Halys. o( *(/alus. The gates and guardhouse at the crossing of the Halys may be held to imply the bridge (mentioned in i. 75. 3), especially as H. here writes diekpera=n, not diaporqmeu=sai as in \u00a7 4. The Halys is fordable in summer at Tchikin Agal and Eccobriga, but communications are cut by floods in winter (Ramsay, A. M. 256 n.), so a bridge would be necessary if the route was to be in constant use. Herodotus had no accurate information about the Halys apart from the Royal road, and clearly did not know that if the road (as he rightly states) crossed the Halys once between Ancyra and Pteria, it must of necessity do so again on its way to the Euphrates, either between Pteria and Caesarea Mazaca, or, on Kiepert's hypothesis (v. i.), at Sebasteia (Siwas). The distance along the Royal road between the Halys and the Euphrates is reckoned at 104 + 15 1/2 parasangs = 3,585 stades, which is far too great for anything like a direct road from the bridge on the Halys to Melitene (Malatia) or Samosata (Samsat). Kiepert therefore rightly argued that the road must have made a considerable circuit, but he seems to be wrong in declaring that his d\u00e9tour must have been to the North and in taking the road round from Tavium by Zela and Comana Pontica to Sebasteia, to meet a route from Sinope. To touch Cilicia the road must have curved southward and then run eastward along the Melas (Tokma Su) to Melitene. dica\\s pu/las. The geography of Herodotus is reduced to hopeless confusion if these be identified with the well-known Cilician gates (Xen. An. i. 2. 21) between Tyana and Tarsus. Ramsay (C. B. I. xiv n.) and Anderson (cf. inf.) hold Herodotus guilty of this confusion. But his Cilicia extended north of Taurus (iii. 90 n.), and his gates should be placed further east. To meet the difficulty that the road passes for three days' journey through Cilicia, Hogarth (Macan, ii. 299 f.) ingeniously suggested that the road did not cross the Euphrates at Tomisa (Isoli), but turned south by Kiakhta to the crossing at Samosata. He points out that the distance from the spine of Taurus to the Euphrates is three days' journey, that monuments of all ages abound along this route, and that Samosata was early of importance. He also appeals to Artemidorus' account (Strab. 663) of the koinh\\ o(do/s from the east as corresponding to the Royal road here. J. G. Anderson (J. H. S. xvii. 41) disputes this correspondence, and argues forcibly that the hilly district north of Mount Masius is far more suitable for a great road than the desert to the south of it, through which a road crossing at Samosata must pass. Further, the 56 1/2 parasangs assigned to Armenia correspond to the real distance from Tomisa on the Euphrates to the junction of the two streams forming the Tigris (Kiepert), while no geographer includes the desert south of Mount Masius in Armenia. The insertion of some such words as those proposed by de la Barre (l. 25) kai\\ tria/konta . . . e(/katon is requisite to make the totals, given by Herodotus himself (ch. 53), 111 stations and 450 parasangs, square with the items, which otherwise only amount to 81 stations and 313 parasangs, and to remove the anomaly that in the case of the Matieni alone the number of parasangs is omitted. Further, with the correction the number of parasangs from the southern border of Armenia to Susa (179 1/2) agrees with the real distance from the passage of the Tigris, which is as the crow flies about 165 parasangs. The difference is little enough to allow for crossing two ranges of mountains, the Carduchian on the upper Tigris, and the pass between the valley of the Gyndes (Diyala) and that of the Choaspes (Kerkha). But the correction of this corrupt passage can hardly stop here. Stein urges the transposition of the addition (v. sup.) to l. 18, after au)toi=si, on the ground that the four rivers\u2014the Tigris, the two Zabs, and the Gyndes, must be placed in Matiene and not in Armenia, since otherwise Herodotus is not only flagrantly wrong in his geography but also inconsistent with himself (cf. \u00a7 4, i. 189, 202). If so, th=s *)armeni/hs is a gloss added when e)k de\\ tau/ths got severed from its original context. On this supposition Matiene here (Meyer, iii, \u00a7 89 n.) includes the greater part of the land usually known as Assyria, but called by Xenophon, Media (Anab. ii. 4. 27; iii. 4. 7, 5. 14). For the various senses of Matiene cf. i. 72 n., and for a more violent reconstruction of the text here, an ingenious but unconvincing article by H. Westberg, Klio, vi. 259 f. *gu/ndhs is in the nominative because ou)/noma e)/xei = o)noma/zetai; cf. iv. 56; vi. 103. 4 ad fin. For the story of Cyrus and the river cf. i. 189. The parasang in Xenophon, as here, measures 30 stades or four Roman miles, thus corresponding to the modern Persian 'far sang' = 3 1/2 to 4 English miles. Other writers estimated it at 40 or 60 stades (Strabo 518), and Agathias (A. D. 570) as low as 21 stades. *memno/nia: cf. ii. 106 n. e)p' h(me/rh| e(ka/sth|. In ch. 54. 2 only three days are allowed for the 540 stades from Ephesus to Sardis; and in iv. 101, 200 stades = 25 Roman miles is taken as a day's journey, but the Royal road is through hilly country, and the 150 stades (20 miles) may be intended as a day's march for an army. Ephesus was at this time the natural starting-point for a journey to Upper Asia (ch. 100, viii. 103). The trade-route of later days (Strab. 663) went by the easier valleys of the Maeander and Lycus to Apameia-Celaenae, and so south of the central desert, but to reach Sardis and the Royal road from Ephesus Mount Tmolus must be crossed. In the days of the Lydian power probably the road from Sardis to the coast had led down the Hermus to Smyrna and Phocaea. th=s *(ellhnikh=s: the Aegean; cf. 28. 2, and th=s *)iw/nwn (ch. 50. 1). trisi/: triw=n h(merw=n o(do/n.

For the history of Pisistratus' tyranny cf. i. 59-64; Ath. Pol. 14 f.; and Appendix XVI, \u00a7\u00a7 5-8. This digression on the liberation of Athens from the sway of the Pisistratidae, incidentally helps to explain why the suit of Aristagoras, rejected at Sparta, was granted at Athens. *(ippi/ew tou= tura/nnou. These words seem intended as a protest against two popular errors (cf. vi. 123): (1) that Harmodius and Aristogiton freed Athens from tyranny, (2) that Hipparchus was the eldest son of Pisistratus and his successor in the tyranny. Both are implied in the famous song attacked by Thucydides (i. 20; vi. 53 f.). That the former error was prevalent soon after the fall of the tyranny is further shown by the statues of the tyrannicides (Harrison, Athens, 77 f.; E. Gardner, G. S. 182 f.; Collignon, S.

The great Panathenaea were celebrated every fourth year, in the third year of the Olympiad, probably 24-28 Hekatombaion. The chief day, here called the Panathenaea, was the 28th, on which the robe (pe/plos) of Athena was brought in procession to the Acropolis, a scene familiar to us from the great Parthenon frieze. On the whole festival cf. A. Mommsen, Feste der Stadt Athen (p. 41 f.), and on Pisistratus' encouragement of such national festivals cf. Appendix The words remain obscure even after their fulfilment, but apparently Hipparchus is encouraged to bear his fate with fortitude, sure that his murderers shall pay the penalty for their evil deed. The oracle would have additional point if H. like Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 17) held Thessalus (Hegesistratus, cf. ch. 94) responsible for the insult which excited the wrath of Harmodius and led to the conspiracy, as in that case Hipparchus would be an innocent victim. For the friendship of the Pisistratidae with soothsayers cf. vii. 6. 3 n. and Appendix XVI, \u00a7 7. H.'s insistence on the reality of the dream (ch. 55) and on its communication to the soothsayers shows that the story had been doubted. a)peipa/menos: probably 'dismissing from his thoughts' (Stein, Abbott) rather than = averrunco, 'averting by sacrifice' (L. and S.). e)/pempe th\\n pomph/n. Aristotle (Ath.

H. rejects the family tradition in favour of a fanciful conjecture resting on the hypothesis that the Gephyraeans were Cadmeians, and Cadmus a Phoenician immigrant. Perhaps he connected Gephyra, the other name for Tanagra (cf. Strabo 404, Steph. Byz.), with Gephyrae in Syria, and was thus led to derive the Gephyraeans from Phoenicia (Petersen, de hist. gent. Attic. p. 6 f.), or he may have misinterpreted the name of Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, who dwelt at Eleon (ch. 43 n.) near Tanagra, and thus have imagined a connexion between the men Tanagra and Cadmus 'the Phoenician' (Toepffer, Attic Geneal. 293 f.). In any case the name *gefurai=oi seems to be derived from ge/fura, a bridge or dyke, as pontifex from pons; and even if Cadmeian Thebes be a Phoenician settlement (cf. iv. 147. 4 n.), there is no reason to connect the Gephyraeans of Tanagra with Thebes. Their own tradition that they came from Euboea is far more probable. In the traditional chronology the invasion of the Epigoni (cf. ch. 61. 2 n.) and the expulsion of the Cadmeians takes place within a generation of the Trojan war, while the immigration of the Boeotians is sixty years after it (Thuc. i. 12). *)aqhne/wn: here the whole land of Attica.

H.'s theory that the Greek alphabet, as he knew it, was of Phoenician origin is borne out by comparing the forms, names, and order of the early Greek and Phoenician letters (Roberts, Greek Epigraphy, \u00a7 4 f.). It contrasts favourably with the ascription of the invention to mythical heroes, such as Palamedes (Stesichorus), Prometheus (Aesch. P. V. 460 f.), Musaeus, Orpheus, or Linus. Of course H. Knew nothing of the primitive Cretan and Mycenaean scripts (A. J. Evans, J. H. S. xiv, xvii, and Scripta Minoa), which being earlier must probably have contributed to the formation of the Phoenician alphabet. His connexion of the earliest Greek alphabet with Cadmus and Boeotia is simply a part of his theory of Phoenician settlement, as is the hypothesis that it spread first among Ionians. H. has not the learning to distinguish the alphabets of Eastern and of Western Hellas, or to recognize that the Ionic alphabet in its final form is a late development of the former. r(uqmo/n = sxh=ma, shape. Cf. Ar. Metaph. H. seems unaware of the three most important modifications: (1) The utilization of some Phoenician consonants, aleph, he, yod, ayin, to represent the vowels a, e, i, o, with the subsequent addition of u, , and (Roberts, \u00a7 5). (2) The evolution of double letters, the three new ones being ph, ch, ps (Roberts, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11). (3) The disappearance of certain unnecessary sibilants (Roberts, \u00a7 6). H. does, however, record the survival of San alongside of Sigma (cf. i. 139 n.). Clearly his interest is more in the form than in the sound of the letters. Yet though he records (ii. 36. 4 n.) that Egyptian writing went from right to left, he is clearly unaware that the same is true of the Phoenician, and of the earliest Greek inscriptions (Roberts, \u00a7 4, No. 1), nor does he notice the transitional boustrofhdo/n style (cf.

No doubt Pergamum was the centre of the trade, but parchment superseded papyrus very slowly, its use for books is mainly late Roman, Byzantine, and mediaeval. *kadmh/ia gra/mmata. Herodotus assumes that the inscriptions are authentic, and thus carries back the writing to the days of Laius and Oedipus. But from their form and style they can hardly be earlier than the seventh century B. C. (Hicks, p. 2). e)n tw=| i(rw=|: cf. i. 52 n. Amphitryon, the human father of Heracles (ii. 44), was son of Alcaeus, king of Tiryns. The Teleboae or Taphii, a tribe from Acarnania, attacked Mycenae in the reign of Electryon, father of Alcmene and uncle of Amphitryon. Amphitryon later accidentally killed his uncle and fled with Alcmene to Thebes to be purified. But before she would marry him she exacted a promise that he would take vengeance on the Teleboae. Hence e)w/n must be emended to e(lw/n or something similar. Laius was brother-in-law of Creon who purified Amphitryon. For the importance of the genealogy of the house of Laius in Herodotean chronology, and for the fixing of chronology by synchronisms such as the voyage of the Argonauts and the Theban and Trojan wars, cf. E. Meyer, Forsch. i. 157 f.; App. XIV. 2. Scaeus helped his father Hippocoon to drive Tyndareus from Lacedaemon, and was afterwards slain there, with his father and brothers, by Heracles.

The chiefs of the Encheleis in southern Illyria (ix. 43. 1 n.) claimed descent from Cadmus (Strabo 326). So tradition alleged that Cadmus and Harmonia in their old age had wandered from Thebes and reigned in Illyria, where their tombs were to be seen. Hence the legend made the Cadmeians, when expelled from Thebes by the Epigoni (u(p' *)argei/wn), go likewise to the North-West under Laodamas, driving the Dorians out of Hestiaeotis on their way (i. 56. 3 n.), and find a new home with their kin in Illyria (Apollodor. iii. 5. 4); but cf. i. 146. 1. kexwrisme/na.

Herodotus seems to have regarded the Alcmaeonids as of true Attic descent (cf. vi. 125 ta\\ a)ne/kaqen), neither Ionian (ch. 66. 2, 69. 1) nor, like the Pisistratidae, immigrants from Pylos (ch. 65. 3 n.). Pausanias (ii. 18. 8, 9), on the other hand, derives them along with the royal house of Melanthus (Medontidae), the Paeonidae, and perhaps the Pisistratidae, from Neleus, king of Pylos. Thus the Alcmaeonidae would be connected with the royal house (a tradition perhaps borne out by the occurrence of the names Alcmaeon and Megacles in the list of life-archons) and with the Pisistratidae, as alleged by Isocrates (peri\\ zeu/gous, 25). It has been ingeniously suggested by Toepffer (Att. Gen. 225 f.), that the Messenian origin of the royal and noble houses may be a fiction intended to support the claim of Athens to be the mother-city of the Ionian colonies, since the great families of Ionia (e. g. the royal house at Miletus) professed to be descended from Neleus of Pylos; but cf. i. 147 n. feu/gontes: exules (cf. i. 64 ad fin.), with acc. ii. 152. 1, vi. 103. 1, 123. 1, elsewhere with u(po\\ tino/s. *leiyu/drion: identified by Milch\u00f6fer with an ancient fort on a spur of Mount Parnes (Karagoufolesa), 2 1/2 miles north of Menidi, the cemetery of Acharnae (Frazer, Paus. v. p. 526).

The Amphictyonic council controlled the finance and undertook the care of the temple at Delphi. When the temple was burnt down in 548 B. C. (Chron. cf. i. 50) the estimate for rebuilding it was 300 talents and subscriptions were solicited from all parts of Greece, and even from Amasis of Egypt (ii. 180 n.). [For a similar national subscription to rebuild the temple destroyed in the fourth century cf. Xen. Hell. vi. 4. 2; Frazer, Paus. v. p. 634.] The collection, as might be expected, was a long business. It was going on before the death of Amasis (526 B. C.), but the Alcmaeonidae did not begin their contract till 514 B. C., after their defeat at Lipsydrium (Ath. Pol. 19), and in all probability did not complete the work till after their return to Athens (510 B. C.) (Philochorus, fr. 70; F. H. G. i. 395; Schol. 9). Grote (iv. 48), however, and Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff (Arist. i. 34 n.) think that the Alcmaeonid contract must have been earlier. Herodotus emphasizes the liberality of the Alcmaeonids. The Isocratean school and other later writers (cf. c. Meid. 144) allege that they got control of a large sum of money by undertaking the contract, and used it to effect the expulsion of the Pisistratids. In the case of a similar restoration at Delos (B. C. H. xiv. 389), half the sum agreed on was given to the contractors when the contract was signed, and four-tenths more when the work was half-done. It is therefore possible (as alleged by Philochorus, l. c., and argued by Wilamowitz, A. and A. i. 33 f.) that the Alcmaeonids misapplied the contract-money, and subsequently after their restoration made splendid amends by their magnificent rebuilding of the temple (Pind. Pyth. vii. 10). But the story is late and may well be inspired by envy and malice. The wealth of the Alcmaeonids seems to have depended largely on their connexion with the East (cf. vi. 125), not on landed estates, presumably now confiscated, in Attica. Their reputation at Delphi makes the tale of embezzlement improbable, and supports the view taken by H. pwri/nou *pari/ou. Parian marble is the best for statues, and far more splendid than tufa or limestone, of which most of the older Greek temples are built. The French excavators at Delphi have found near the east fa\u00e7ade of the temple, buried under the Sacred Way, two sets of archaic pediment-sculptures, one made of marble, the other of tufa. So, too, the architectural fragments are partly of tufa, partly of Parian marble, so far supporting H.'s account. Cf. Frazer, Paus. v, pp. 631-2; B. C. H. xx. (641 f.); Bury, Hermathena, x. 267 f. *)agximo/lion do/kimon. Perhaps the fact that the expedition was sent by sea may account for the absence of the king, as apparently in the expedition to Samos (iii. 54 f.), and certainly at Salamis, where Eurybiades commands (viii. 42. 2). The alleged bribery of the oracle is supported by other instances (cf. vi. 66 n.). It is, however, in this case denied by Plutarch (de Malign. Herod. ch. 23) and may be a fiction to cover a change in Spartan policy. For though the piety of the Spartans which made them slow to send troops to Marathon (vi. 106) and against Mardonius (ix. 7 f.) may have been genuine, it seems more likely that their motive in this case was political, viz. the friendship between the Pisistratids and Argos (i. 61; Ath. Pol. 19). Policy dictated the expulsion of the tyrants just as policy later counselled their restoration (ch. 91). summaxi/h. This alliance, along with many others (cf. Appendix XVI. 8), was made by Pisistratus. To compliment his allies he named one of his sons Thessalus (Thuc. i. 20, vi. 55; Ath. Pol. 17, ch. 94 n.). Thessaly, however, proved a broken reed both to the tyrants and later (Thuc. i. 107) to the democracy of Athens. koinh=| basile/a. The Thessalians in foreign affairs often acted in common (Thuc. i. 102, iv. 78), but it seems unlikely that there were real kings in Thessaly. The title is occasionally given to the chiefs of the leading families, e. g. the Aleuadae of Larissa (Pind. Pyth. x. 3; H. vii. 6. 2, but not in ix. 1. 1, 58. 1), and Orestes of Pharsalus (Thuc. i. 111). Here it seems to mean a general appointed to command the national army, the tago/s, though that term is first explicitly used of Jason of Pherae (Xen. Hell. vi. 1. 8). In Thucydides (iv. 78) the Thessalians are said to be under a close family oligarchy (dunastei/a), but probably this refers to the home government of the various cities. In 431 B. C. the troops sent to the aid of Athens are under seven commanders appointed by the seven cities which sent them (Thuc. ii. 22). (See note, p. 415.) *koniai=on.

The modern Ampelokipi ('vineyards'), some eleven stadia from the gate along the Cephisian road, is held to be a perversion of this name. In that case the Cynosarges, a walled te/menos, which contained a shrine of Heracles (vi. 116) and a gymnasium for the no/qoi of citizens, must be north-east of Athens at the foot of Mount Lycabettus. The position assigned suits the narrative in vi. 115 f., since the Persians in the bay could see the victors of Marathon encamped on the hill, and so would naturally put about and sail away (Frazer, Paus. ii, p. 193 f.). Recently, however, Dr. D\u00f6rpfeld has argued that Alopece and Cynosarges must have lain south of the Ilissus towards Phalerum, near the church of S. Marina, and Sir C. Smith has excavated a building south of the Olympieum on the bank of the river, which, on rather slight grounds, he holds to be Cynosarges (Frazer, Paus. v. 493 f.). This would suit the present passage, as its natural meaning is that the Spartans were ridden down in the plain between Phalerum and Athens and driven back to their ships. Their fallen leader would probably be buried near the spot at which he fell; hence, if Alopece be Ampelokipi, we have to suppose that the Spartans had marched past Athens, which is unlikely. a)pode/cantes. This appointment of one king to command does not harmonize with the story told in ch. 74 f., or with the royal prerogative alleged in vi. 56. It is, however, the regular practice later (cf. Xen.

The doubt whether the whole city was walled recurs in connexion with the campaigns of Marathon and Salamis. Here its easy capture may be explained by the existence of a party within it opposed to the tyrants. Apart from the inherent probability, the definite arguments for a prae-Themistoclean city-wall are strong. 1. The plain meaning of Thucydides (i. 89. 93) is that the Athenians rebuilt the walls of the city, parts of which were standing (H. ix. 13. 2), though they enlarged the circuit. 2.

Thereafter it was an open space at the north-west end of the Acropolis (Thuc. ii. 17), close beneath the wall (Lucian, Piscator 47) and the cave of Pan (Lucian, Bis Accus. 8). It may have extended along the whole West front (D\u00f6rpfeld citing Lucian, Pisc. 42) from the Anaceum, shrine of Dioscuri north-west to the Asclepium south-west. On this and other disputed points cf. D'Ooge, of Athens, pp. 21-31 and 361-8. also Ath. 19, copying Herodotus. Thucydides (vi. 55) says that Hippias alone had children (by his wife Myrrhine). Similarly, whereas H. speaks of the Pisistratidae stirring up the Persian king against Athens (vi. 94. 1, vii. 6. 2), Thucydides (vi. 59) names Hippias only. e)p' oi(=si, 'on the terms asked by the Athenians'; cf. ch. 82. 3, vi. 108. 5. *si/geion.

This Tisander cannot be identical with the father of Hippoclides (vi. 127. 4, 128. 2), who was undoubtedly a Philaid, since if so H. would know he was sprung from Ajax. Nor is the statement that Isagoras was 'a friend of the tyrants' (Ath. Pol. 20) of much weight, since clearly he was the leader of the aristocrats. suggene/es = gennh=tai: gentiles, members of the clan or race *dii\\ *kari/w|: cf. i. 171. 6 n. Plutarch (de Mal.

These parties recall, and to some extent represent, the old factions of the Shore and the Plain (i. 59). At the head of the former stood the Alcmaeonids, whose liberalism may have dated from Solon's act of amnesty, which by permitting their return bound them to support his legislation. They had taken the lead in the expulsion of the tyrants (ch. 63), and the restoration of liberty. Opposed to them were the land-holding class, who hoped for an oligarchy, and the secret supporters of the exiled tyrants. to\\n dh=mon prosetairi/zetai. Probably (1) the poor Diacrii, who had been supporters of Pisistratus (i. 59. 3), and (2) immigrants excluded from the phratries and the four lonic tribes which remained the basis of Solon's constitution. The statement h(ttw/menos de\\ tai=s e(tairei/ais o( *kleisqe/nhs 20. 1) may have been suggested by H.'s phraseology, but the definite mention of political clubs would seem, like the term prosta/ths tou= dh/mou (Ath. Pol. 20. 4), to be an anachronism. tetrafu/lous e)o/ntas *)aqhnai/ous. Ancient tradition rightly made these four tribes not Attic by 'Ionic' (ch. 69. 1; Eur. Ion 1575 f.), [whether they were borrowed by Athens from Miletus (Wilamowitz, A. and A. ii. 241), or, as is more probable, were characteristic of all purely Ionic states, since they are found in Delos (B. C. H. x. 473, xiv. 418), in Teos (C. I. G. 3078, 3079), Cyzicus (C. I. G. 3657, 3663-5), &c.], deriving them from the four sons of Ion. The view that they represent castes can hardly be maintained (Strabo 383; Plut. Sol. 23). *ai)gikorei=s might indeed mean the of rocky Diacria, and *)argadei=s might = *)ergadei=s (Plut. Sol. 23), and mean either husbandmen or handicraftsmen, though even these etymologies are uncertain. But *gele/ontes, undoubtedly the true form (C. I. G. 3078, 3664, 3665), remains a riddle. Some connect it with gela=n = splendere, and see in it a class of priests and nobles, while others, deriving it from gh=, make them peasant proprietors. But the latter are elsewhere (Busolt, ii. 96), gewmo/roi, gewrgoi/, a)/groikoi, and there is no trace of a priestly caste in Attica, while the nobles, Eupatrids, belonged to all four tribes. Again, the *(/oplhtes can hardly be the 'warriors', as in that case they would not come last in order, while if they are turned into handicraftsmen, tool-makers, they overlap the *)argadei=s. It may be better with Maas (Gott. Gel. Anz. 1889, 803; 1890, 353 n.), to connect the tribal names with halfforgotten deities, the Geleontes with Zeus Geleon (C. I. A. iii. 2), the *(/oplhtes with *(oplo/smioi, *(oplo/smios being a title of Zeus in Arcadia, *(oplosmi/a of Hera in Elis, while a tribe *(oplodmi/a; with *ai)gi/s (Eur. Ion 1580), and *)argadei=s with *)/argos, the god of light. In any case, if the tribes ever had been castes or local divisions, no trace of the fact remained: they were in the time of Cleisthenes based on descent. Cf. Busolt, ii. 98 f. For the four Ionic tribes cf. Ramsay, Asianic Elements in Greek Civilization, pp. 243-66. e(te/rwn: not Ionic but indigenous Attic heroes, Pausan. hero of Salamis (cf. viii. 64; Il. ii. 557-8), since 560 B. C. at any rate an Attic possession. The worship of the heroes gave a certain religious unity to the new tribes; their statues stood together in the Agora at Athens. Aristotle (Ath. Pol. ch. 21) tells us that the Pythia selected the ten eponymous heroes of the tribes from a hundred names submitted to her, a characteristic method of reconciling divine and human choice. 'This he did in imitation of his grandfather.' Cf. ix. 34. 1, and i. 176 ad fin. The resemblance between the two policies, on which H. again insists (ch. 69. 1), is less clear than the contrast. The historian's distorted view shows how inadequate was his appreciation of Cleisthenes' political reforms. Introd. \u00a7 32. For their real significance cf. ch. 69. 1 n. Cleisthenes of Sicyon reigned thirtyone years, circ. 600-570 B. C.; vi. 126 f. and Appendix XVI, \u00a7 2. *)argei/oisi. In legend Sicyon was a vassal-kingdom of the Pelopid monarchs of Argos: perhaps Dorian Argos attempted to reassert this old suzerainty, and was successfully resisted by Cleisthenes. *(omh/reia e)/pea. Even in the Iliad and Odyssey the constant use of 'Argives' for Greeks, and the position of Agamemnon as overlord of Sicyon, would be an offence to Cleisthenes, but it seems more probable that H. here, in spite of his doubt as to the authorship of the Epigoni (iv. 32, and cf. ii. 117), refers to the Thebais which began *)/argos a)/eide, qe/a, poludi/yion, and to the Epigoni in which played a great part. ta\\ polla\\ pa/nta, 'almost throughout'; cf. i. 203. 1, ii. 35. 2. *)adrh/stou. A., originally perhaps a local god, was in the Epics son of Talaus the Argive; expelled from Argos, he took refuge with Polybus of Sicyon, married his daughter, and inherited his kingdom. He took a leading part in the expeditions against Thebes, and seems to have returned to Argos (Paus. ii. 6. 6, &c.). There was a cult of the hero at Megara (Paus. i. 43. 1) as well as at Sicyon. e)kbalei=n. To recover or to expel the corpse is to recover or expel the hero.

If the Delphic god really gave this response to Cleisthenes, it was an ungrateful return to the man who had championed the cause of Delphi in the Sacred War (Paus. ii. 9. 6, x. 37. 6), and had joined in the re-institution of the Pythian festival, 582 B. C. (Paus. x. 7. 6), and who may well have founded the treasury of the Sicyonians recently discovered at Delphi (Paus. x. 11; Frazer, v. 270, 628). Probably the oracle is a product of later days, when Dorian Sparta was all powerful at Delphi and blackened the fame of anti-Dorian tyrants. e)/dosan. Cf. the help lent by Thebes to Aegina against Athens (ch. 80, 81). Melanippus, a Theban hero (Aesch. S. c.

Adrastus was his grandson or son-in-law. ta\\ pa/qea: especially in the expeditions against Thebes. In the first he lost all his companions, escaping himself by a miracle; in the second, only his son Aegialeus fell. Perhaps the story grew from the names Talaus ('wretched') and Adrastus, 'the inevitable might of Fate.' xorou\\s me/n: for the omission of the article cf. ix. 88. 1; i. 194. 4; ii. 402, &c. The worship of Dionysus was popular with the common people and favoured by the tyrants. Pisistratus founded the city Dionysia at Athens, or at least the dramatic performances. Periander of Corinth was the patron of Arion, the great maker of choric song (i. 23 n.). a)pe/dwke (cf. reddidit) here means 'assigned to D., to whom they of right belonged'. There is no reason to think that at Sicyon the chorus had first been given to Dionysus, then transferred to Adrastus, and now restored to D., nor can this have been true of the sacrifice now assigned to Melanippus. Choruses would be appropriate to Adrastus, whether as originally a Chthonian deity (Welcker) or as a guardian hero. For the connexion of tragic choruses with the worship of the dead cf. Ridgeway, Origin of Tragedy, pp. 26-39; and for the change of 'heroes' Thuc. v. 11. The Orthagoridae belonged to the non-Dorian population, and no doubt in some way abased the power and pride of the Dorians in favour of their own tribe. Yet it is difficult to believe that such terms of contempt can have been the official names of the Dorian tribes, maintained for sixty years after the death of Cleisthenes. Probably they were mere nicknames, which arose from some bitter jest of the tyrant (Bury, p. 156). The sixty years may be taken to end with the re-establishment of Dorian ascendancy, at the time when, led by Cleomenes, Sparta strove to enlarge her confederacy by the expulsion of the Pisistratidae (510 B. C.). At least we hear (Plut. de Mal Herod. ch. 22) of a Sicyonian tyrant Aeschines put down by the Spartans (cf. Appendix XVI, \u00a7 10). tou/s: Steph. Byz. s. v. makes Dyman and Pamphylus sons of the Dorian king Aegimius, who adopted the Heracleid Hyllus. Of the real origin of the tribes nothing is certainly known (cf. Busolt, i. 530). *ai)giale/os. Doubtless a local name, the men of the shore (cf. vii. 94). Probably the name is older than Cleisthenes, and was now revived. The eponymous hero Aegialeus (cf. ch. 66) is no doubt derived from the name of the tribe. kai\\ ou(=tos u(peridw\\n *)/iwnas. H. seems to regard Cleisthenes as of old Attic, as opposed to Ionic descent (ch. 62. 2 n.), and so likely to despise Ionians as his grandfather despised Dorians. But the motive is superficial and improbable. The Athenians still celebrated the Ionic festival, the Apaturia (i. 147), and retained the old tribes and phratries, at least for religious purposes. We also find Athens claiming kinship with the Ionians (ch. 97; ix. 106) as their mother city, and may attribute the contempt expressed for the Ionians, here and elsewhere, to later prejudice reflected in H. (cf. i. 143 n.). The true meaning of the reforms was very different. By breaking down the old tribal organization, Cleisthenes was enabled to strengthen the state by the admission of many new citizens (cf. Ath. Pol. 20a)podidou\\s tw=| plh/qei th\\n Pol. ch. 21), and to free it from the undue influence of the old families and clans. [Cf. Aristotle's sagacious remarks (Pol. vi. 4. 18, 19, 1319 b) on the necessity of breaking up old associations and forming new ones, when the franchise is extended.] By the wise choice of a natural local division, the deme, as the basis of his scheme, and the skilful distribution of the demes and trittyes among the ten tribes (Ath. Pol. ch. 21, inf. \u00a7 2), he provided against the crying danger of local factions, and also secured the permanence of his institutions. Lastly, by making Athens the one place where members of a tribe gathered together from their different trittyes for a common purpose, Cleisthenes elevated the city in the eyes of all its citizens, new and old. He thus completed the work, ascribed in legend to Theseus, but in reality left incomplete by Solon and Pisistratus, the unification (sunoikismo/s) of Attica. For Cleisthenes' measures cf. Busolt (op. cit. 853 f.) and E. M. Walker in C. A. H. iv. 141-56. a)pwsme/non may be middle (Kr\u00fcger), meaning 'which had before rejected him', or passive (Stein) 'before despised by him' (as an aristocrat). fula/rxous: properly, at Athens, the captains of the troop of horse furnished by each tribe at least as early as 411 B. C. (Ath. Pol. ch. 30; cf. ch. 61), and probably in the time of Herodotus. But these officers seem to date from the re-organization of the cavalry in the days of the Athenian empire, since no large force of horsemen is likely in early days or possible at Marathon (vi. 112 n.). H., who in the next words applies the term fu/larxoi to the four old fulobasilei=s, may be here using it loosely for the officials technically called e)pimelhtai\\ tw=n fulw=n (C. I. A. ii. 554, 57-9, 564, 567 b), unless indeed these officials too are of later date, and the strategi lie concealed under this strange name. de/kaxa = 'in ten parts' (cf. Hicks 81, l. 35) is an acceptable conjecture (Busolt, ii. 405 n. 3), as it not only improves the construction but frees the text from the unlikely statement that there were exactly one hundred demes. Such a round number is improbable since (1) The demes were not now first called into being (cf. tou\\s dh/mous and i. 60. 4, 62. 1; ix. 73. 2), but existed at least in the days of the tyrants (cf. i. 60, 62 nn.), as may be seen from Pisistratus' kata\\ dh/mous dikastai/ (Ath. Pol. 16) and Polemo's time (second century B. C.; cf. Strabo 396) was 174, of which some 166 have been found on inscriptions: even in the fifth century there must have been more than one hundred. (3) The supposed support of the number one hundred derived from the 'hundred heroes' fails, since the hundred heroes are not the eponymi of the demes, but the indigenous worthies from among whom the Pythia chose the ten eponymi of the tribes (Ath. Pol. 21; Busolt, ii. 406). kate/neime. For the principle of this distribution, the prevention of sta/sis by combining different parts of Attica in one tribe, cf. Bury, p. 211. 2; Busolt, ii. 418 f. For a list of demes Pauly-Wiss. v. 35; and for their distribution into tribes ib. ii. 2227. H., caring but little for constitutional history, is silent on the point. The attempts of Cleomenes to promote oligarchic reaction at Athens foiled, first by the resistance of the Athenians and then by the refusal of the allies to follow him, with notes on the Cyloniana)/gos (71) and on Dorian invasions of Attica (76). H. clearly places the constitution of Cleisthenes before the second visit of Cleomenes, Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 20) dates it to the archonship of Isagoras (508-7 B. C.), after Cleomenes' second intervention. The new constitution could only take definite form after the final defeat of Isagoras, yet the reformer must have previously won over the people to his side, and the boulh/ which Cleomenes and Isagoras wish to dissolve, to whose aid the people rally, would seem probably to be the new democratic council of 500. Aristotle is dependent on H. for purely historical matter, but may have taken his date for the reforms (Isagoras' archonship) from an Atthis. Cf. Busolt, ii. 403. e)pile/gwn, 'describing them more exactly as the accursed.' Cf. the similar demand of Sparta just before the Peloponnesian war for the banishment of Pericles, an Alcmaeonid by maternal descent (Thuc. i. 126). Thucydides (i. 126) completes and corrects this account of Cylon's coup d'\u00e9tat, which is clearly based on Alcmaeonid tradition. Plutarch (Solon 12) is in general agreement with Thucydides, but probably drew immediately from some Atthis. The chief points of difference are: (1) Cylon received aid from his father-in-law, Theagenes of Megara. (2) Being encouraged by the Delphic oracle to make the attempt at the chief festival of Zeus, he, an Olympic victor, chose the Olympic games, not the Attic Diasia. (3) He actually seized the Acropolis and was there besieged for some time by the Attic levies under the Archons. (4) Cylon and his brother escaped, their followers were slaughtered. e)pi\\ turanni/di e)ko/mhse, 'set tw=| koma=|s: for e)pi/ marking the end cf. i. 66. 1; and for pride in wearing the hair long cf. i. 82. 7, 8. to\\ a)/galma: probably the Athene Polias in the earlier Erechtheum. Cf. ch. 72. 3 n. tou/tous: presumably Cylon as well as his partisans, but cf. (4) supra. oi( pruta/nies tw=n naukra/rwn: naukrarie/wn (Stein, Abbott) would be an improvement. Naucraries were local districts whose presidents (nau/kraroi) were responsible (Ath. Pol. 8. 3; Pollux viii. 108; Bekk. Anec. i. 283) for levying money and contingents for the army and ships for the fleet (the name coming from nau=s and kra/, the root of krai/nw, Busolt, ii. 191). The notion that Solon first instituted 48 such naucraries (12 in each of the four Ionic tribes) is due to Photius' misrepresentation of Ath. Pol. 8. 3, where their pre-existence is really implied. There is then no reason to doubt that the 'presidents of the naucraries' (prob. = nau/kraroi) were important officers, but the statement that they were the supreme power in the state (for e)/nemon cf. i. 59. 6; v. 92 b 1) is directly contradicted by Thucydides (i. 126), who rightly names the archons, in which he is followed by Plutarch, Sol. 12 *megaklh=s o( a)/rxwn kai\\ oi( suna/rxontes. Aristotle (Ath. Pol.) rightly sees in the naucrari local officials (ch. 21), succeeded by the demarchs, while the archonship is the chief political office (ch. 13). The attempt of Harpocration to reconcile Herodotus and Thucydides by identifying archons and naucrari is a mere subterfuge contradicted by all other authorities; nor is it likely that the archons were the presidents of the naucrari as has been suggested. The true explanation of the passage is that Herodotus, or his authority, is anxious to absolve the Alcmaeonid archon, Megacles, from the guilt of the sacrilege by throwing the blame on another board of magistrates. For his Alcmaeonid leanings cf. vi. 121, and Appendix XVIII, plh\\n qana/tou. The agreement bound the suppliants to appear before a court of justice, but guaranteed them their lives. Cf. yet natural in Herodotus, since his continuous history of Athens begins with Pisistratus. Thucydides gives two notes of time, the Olympiad (sup.) and the synchronism with Theagenes. Aristotle (Ath. Pol.) apparently placed Cylon before Draco, and Euseb. Chron. i. 198 (cf. Paus. i. 28. 1) dates his victory in the foot-race at Olympia to 640 B. C. Hence, as he was apparently still young at the time of his rising (cf. th\\n e(tairhi/hn tw=n h(likiwte/wn), Busolt (i. 670, ii. 206) and others prefer the date 632 B. C. u(pece/sxe, 'retired' (vi. 74. 1; viii. 132. 2). He hoped by this to satisfy Cleomenes. e)pi/stia. It is most unlikely that 700 families were implicated in the murder of the Cylonians, yet Aristotle follows H. verbally. Probably many newly enfranchised citizens were expelled at the same time, and thus completed the total of 700 households. th\\n boulh/n. Clearly to Herodotus the new Boule of five hundred, fifty from each tribe, which naturally championed democracy against this oligarchic reaction; yet, if we follow the chronology of Aristotle (cf. ch. 70. 1 n.), it would be the Solonian council of four hundred. Were the three hundred partisans of Isagoras to form an oligarchic council, from which the magistrates would be taken? There had been a council of three hundred convened to try the 'Accursed' (Plut. Sol. 12). *lakedaimo/nioi. The Lacedaemonians were at times willing to save themselves, regardless of their allies (cf. Thuc. iii. 109): yet Isagoras (ch. 74. 1) escaped, and possibly his partisans, \u00a7 4 n. h( fh/mh: the well-known (cf. ch. 35. 2; ix. 100, pa/lin the Erechtheum (viii. 41. 2, 51. 2 n.); but there was also on the Acropolis, before the Persian war, the old Hecatompedon discovered by D\u00f6rpfeld (M. A. I. xi. 1886, p. 337), between the sites of the Parthenon and Erechtheum (Frazer, Paus. Appendix, Bk. I). D\u00f6rpfeld further holds that this temple was rebuilt after the Persian war and existed at least as a treasury in the days of H., but this seems improbable (cf. D'Ooge, The Acropolis, p. 41 f., 369-97). If neither this temple nor the Erechtheum, which was rebuilt late in the Peloponnesian war, were restored when H. was writing his vagueness in referring to 'the temple' is more natural. h( i(erei/h. The Eteobutadae supplied the priestess of Athena Polias, in cf. Soph. Phil. 1262. With this attempt of Cleomenes we may compare his conduct at Argos, vi. 81, 82. *dwrieu=si: probably for all non-Ionians, perhaps for all but the priests. Cf. Caes. B.

The Athenians, presumably their assembly under its democratic leader, are the first to make advances to the Great King, and to invite his intervention in Greece. Naturally they were anxious to preserve their newly won liberties and their independence against the overwhelming power of the coalition arrayed by Sparta against them. Yet it is a shock to find that the chief champion of Hellas against the Mede had first proposed an alliance with him. ti/nes e)o/ntes: a regular expression for the lordly contempt felt by Persian kings and princes for small and distant tribes and cities (i. 153. 1; v. 13. 2, 105. 1). a)pekoru/fou, 'put the matter to them in a nutshell.' Cf. 'on their own responsibility, at their own risk' (iii. 71. 5, 155. 4; v. 106. 4; viii. 109. 1). Probably the envoys knew that Cleisthenes was ready to make submission, but were afterwards disavowed when their action raised a storm at Athens. H.'s Athenian (? Alcmaeonid) informants seem guilty here of at least suppressio veri. Cleisthenes henceforth disappears from history, presumably because he fell into disgrace. He may even perhaps have been banished, though the late tradition (Aelian, V. H. xiii. 24) that he was the first man ostracized deserves no credit (cf. Ath. Pol. ch. 22). The leanings of the Alcmaeonidae to the East may be partly explained by the origin of their wealth (vi. 125), and certainly throw light on their attitude in 490 B. C. (cf. Appendix XVIII, \u00a7 6). e)s to\\ sulle/gei. It seems impossible that the Spartans and allies should not have known that the expedition was directed against Attica, especially as the Boeotians seize Oenoe by a concerted plan, but they may well have been ignorant of the purpose of Cleomenes to restore tyranny at Athens. On the question whether the king had authority to order an expedition see Appendix XVII, \u00a7 2, and vi. 56. 1. *)eleusi=na. The scholiast on Ar. Lys. 273 gives named Oenoe, one in the valley above the plain of Marathon, the other, here mentioned, on the borders of Boeotia, but on the Athenian side of Mount Cithaeron. It may be placed at Myoupoli (? *oi)no/h po/lis), where there is a small walled town with outlying forts near the Boeotian border (Thuc. ii. 18), while the fortress commanding the road from Thebes to Athens and blocking the pass (Gyphto-Kastro) must be Eleutherae (cf. Frazer, ii. 518 f.; v. 537 f.). For Oenoe, Eleutherae, and other border forts cf. J. H. S. xlvi (1926), pp. 1-26. *(usiai/ was also near the road from Athens to Plataea and Thebes, but was on the northern slope of Cithaeron, and was never an Attic deme.

For its site cf. ix. 15. 3 n. a)mfiboli/h|, 'between two fires'; the attack on Eleusis and on the northern frontier. Thucydides (ii. 76; iv. 32, 36) uses a)mfi/bolos in this sense. *kori/nqioi: this service is not cited by the Corinthian orator in Thuc. i. 41.

The date of the law and of the hostility between Cleomenes and Demaratus is a little doubtful; cf. vi. 82. At any rate, henceforth custom forbade both kings to go forth together in command of the host. Indeed it was a little unusual for them both to be absent from Sparta. Cf. Xen. Hell. v. object of the law was military, to prevent division of command, and it certainly was not stretched to cover cases of absence on other business (cf. vi. 50. 2, 65. 1, 73) or of urgent necessity (Thuc. v. 75; Xen.

Cf. the stories of the Dioscuri in Paus. iv. 16. 5, 9, iv. 27. 1 f., and in Macaulay's Lake Regillus. The tradition that Megara was conquered by the Dorians after the rest of the Peloponnese is clear and well founded: that it was previously Ionic (i. e. Attic) and conquered when Codrus saved Attica seems a later invention supported by genealogical myths (Paus. i. 39; Busolt, i. 219 f.). It would appear to be the Nisa of the Homeric catalogue (Il. ii. 508), and if so belonged originally to Boeotia. deu/teron kai\\ tri/ton.

It is impossible to say whether this schedule of expeditions was compiled when the events of 446 B. C. or 431 B. C. had made Dorian invasions familiar to Athens. In that case the omission of all reference to the doings of Pleistoanax (Thuc. i. 114 and Archidamus (Thuc. ii. 10 f.) is remarkable, especially in view of the mention in ix. 73. *)aqh/nas = *)attikh/n, ch. 57. 2 n.

The hostility of the Boeotians is easily explained by the alliance of Athens with Plataea, probably just concluded (vi. 108 n.): that of Chalcis may be due to the expansion of Athens in the Thracian region, where Chalcis had interests, under Pisistratus (cf. App. XVI, \u00a7 8), or to Athenian friendship with Eretria (i. 61; vi. 100), the old rival of Chalcis. klhrou=xoi. A cleruchy resembled a Roman, rather than a Greek or a modern colony, in being a measure of poor relief, and of military defence, rather than of emigration. The cleruchs who were settled on the confiscated lands remained Athenian citizens (cf. further Gilbert, G. A. i. 445 f.), liable to military and naval service (cf. viii. 1). This is probably the earliest instance of a policy widely applied later by Pericles. A fragmentary inscription (Hicks 4) is now held to record the regulation of affairs at Salamis after its conquest, and not the establishment of a cleruchy. That Athens possessed state-land in Salamis seems proved by viii. 11. 3. i(ppobo/tai (cf. Strabo 447): a suitable name for a rich oligarchy of knights, since in such states as Chalcis and Eretria the knightly cavalry was the chief force, and only the rich could afford to breed and keep horses.

The site of this monument is a standing puzzle to archaeologists. That it was, as H. says, originally set up circ. 505 B. C. seems certain, and also that it was destroyed or removed by the Persians in 480 B. C., so that the monument seen by H. was a reproduction erected about 450 B. C.\u2014not, however, on the original site. The evidence is as follows. In 1887 a broken block of Eleusinian stone, evidently a fragment of an oblong base, was found in the ruins of a large building to the north-east of the Propylaea, probably near its original position. On the block may be seen, in letters belonging to the end of the sixth century B. C., the words (Hicks 12; C.I. A. iv.2 334 a) u(/b]*r*i*n*g*a*i*d*es, and below *t*o*n*h*i*g*g*o*s *d[eka/thn. Previously, in 1869, a block of Pentelic marble, also a fragment of a base, had been found with an inscription in characters belonging to the middle of the fifth century (C. I. A. i. 334) to this effect: *aq]*e*n*a*i*o*n *e*r*l*m*a[sin, and in the line below i(/]*g*g*o*s *d*e[ka/thn, to which has been added more recently a scrap containing the syllable san twice repeated. Both inscriptions are clearly fragments of the dedication inscribed on the pedestal of the chariot: in both each couplet formed a single long line. But in the earlier the hexameters were transposed, the line referring to the chains standing first, which shows that the original monument stood near the chains hung on the wall, whereas the newer was near the entrance of the Acropolis. In all probability the trophy was restored after the conquest of Euboea by Pericles (i. e. 445 B. C.), or after that of Boeotia at the battle of Oenophyta (i. e. 456 B. C.). Either would be a suitable occasion for such a restoration. In favour of the latter Hauvette (p. 51) urges that H., who must have seen the new monument, since he (like Diodorus and the Anthology) quotes the verses in the new order, gives no hint that the trophy had just been restored. The epigram is to be ascribed to Simonides (Aristides, ii. 512; rather These words raise a further difficulty. Does H. mean the famous Propylaea of Mnesicles finished in 432 B. C.? To this there are the following objections: (1) Within the Propylaea there is no room for so large a monument as the chariot would seem to have been. (2) On the slope immediately in front to the left there is no suitable site. (3) Pausanias (i. 28. 2) clearly implies that the chariot stood on the Acropolis itself inside the Propylaea. We must therefore infer that the restored chariot was moved when the new Propylaea of Mnesicles was built, and that H. is referring to the open space in front of the old Propylon. This gateway is still discernible behind the southwest wing of the Propylaea, set in the Pelasgic wall, and was probably restored by Cimon after the Persian war (cf. D'Ooge, Acropolis, pp. 72-7, 301 f., with fig. 7). No certain inference can be drawn as to the date of H.'s sojourn or sojourns in Athens (cf. Introduction, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 10). The epithets belong to different 'chain' (sidh/reos), and 'prison' (a)xluo/eis). *)aqhnai=oi hu)/chnto ends, me/zones. dhloi=: probably personal (cf. 116. 6, 149. 2) rather than = dh=lon o(/ti (cf. ii. 117). i)shgori/h, 'liberty,' 'equality,' as shown in the right of free speech, especially in matters political. Cf. Xen. Rep. Ath. i. as usual, champions freedom and constitutional government against tyranny (cf. iii. 80 f. and Introd. \u00a7 7). His argument, though not conclusive, is interesting (Macan) as an early statement of the close relations between the political institutions and the foreign policy and fortunes of a state (cf. Polyb. vi. 3; Ar. Pol. v. 4. 8, 1304 a; vi. 7. 1, 1321 a). His prediction of military success for democracy may be true in a short national struggle for existence like the Persian war, but can hardly be extended to a career of conquest, still less to the maintenance of an empire (cf. Thuc. iii. 37). e)qeloka/keon, 'would not do their best' (viii. 22. 2; ix. 67). Xerxes maintains the opposite view (vii. 103. 4). Hippocrates (de Aer. 23) less than to the Pisistratid tyranny (cf.

Since Zeus was said to have carried off Aegina, the mother of Aeacus, to Oenone (i. e. Aegina; cf. viii. 46. 1) from Phlius, her father Aesopus must have been originally the river-god of the Phliasian stream (Paus. ii. 5. 2), but from an early date he was identified with the Boeotian river, and Aegina thus made a sister of Thebe, as in this oracle and in Pindar, Isthm. vii. 18; cf. Paus. ix. 1. The interpretation illustrates the use of myths for political purposes; cf. ch. 67. tou\\s *ai)aki/das. Probably images of Aeacus and his sons (cf. ch. 75). They are specially at home in Aegina (cf. viii. 64, 83, 84), yet Ajax and Telamon are at home in Salamis also (viii. 64), and thus are connected with Athens (ch. 66. 2), where too Aeacus is given a te/menos (ch. 89). So the Aeacidae might well refuse to aid the foes of Athens. eu)daimoni/h| mega/lh|. Great prosperity, especially if sudden, would be to H. a reason for expecting disaster. The wealth of Aegina, traced by Athenian scandal to buying gold as brass from thievish Helots at Plataea (ix. 80), was really of long standing, as is shown by their separate shrine at Naucratis (ii. 178), the proverbial wealth of Sostratus (iv. 152), and above all by the Aeginetan weights, measures, and coinage (vi. 127. 3 n.). But H. depreciates the Aeginetans as foes and rivals of Athens. Here they break the usages of war; in ix. 78 an Aeginetan proposes a worse outrage on Hellenic custom. In fine, their expulsion from their island is but the proper penalty for their cruelty and sacrilege (vi. 91). Nevertheless, he allows that the Athenians were the aggressors in the original war (ch. 85, 86), and implies that they acted unjustly in retaining the Aeginetan hostages (vi. 86). He also states that the Aeginetans showed patriotism in resisting Xerxes [though they submitted to Darius (vi. 49)] and won the prize of valour at Salamis (viii. 91, 93). a)kh/rukton: a war without due notice, elsewhere an implacable war, or a guerilla war (Macan). *fa/lhron parali/hs: the port (cf. ch. 63; vi. 116) and coast region (Ath.

These deities were also worshipped at Troezen and Epidaurus, and in Laconia. *au)chsi/h is clearly connected with 'Increase' (au)/cein, cf. the Attic deity *au)cw/), but the derivation of *dami/h remains a problem. Most probably it may be connected with Mother-Earth, *dhmh/thr, since at Rome and in Italy the Bona Dea, an earth-goddess, worshipped exclusively by women (Ovid, Fast. v. 150 f.), was called Damia, her victim damium, and her priestess damiatrix. These names must be of Greek origin, and seem to show that the Greek deity Damia migrated from Tarentum, where the feast of Dameia was celebrated, to Rome, and was there engrafted on the Italian Bona Dea = Fauna (Warde Fowler, Roman Festivals, pp. 102-6). In any case it can hardly be doubtful that these goddesses are concerned with the increase of the fruits of the earth, and with child-birth in women. Their worship resembled that of Demeter and Persephone in the raillery practised at both by the women (ch. 83. 3 n.), in the throwing of stones as a religious rite, and in the manner of sacrifice (Paus. ii. 30. 4, 32. 2). In the fact that the statues were made of wood we may perhaps see a relic of the supposed fertilizing power of trees (cf. the May-pole). For parallel spring customs in many lands and their explanation cf. Frazer, Paus. ii. 492; iii. 266 f. i(rwta/tas. The mori/ai at Athens were held sacred and protected by law (Lysias, peri\\ shkou=, 2, 7, &c.). The first olive, still to be seen in the days of H. in the Erechtheum (viii. 55 n.), was the gift of Athena to Attica; hence the view that olives were once found in Attica only. The image of Athena Polias in the Erechtheum was made of olive-wood (Athenagoras, Leg. 17); indeed, primitive statues were generally made of wood (Paus. viii. 17. 2). a)pa/cousi. The Athenians later required cleruchs and allies at Brea, Erythrae, and elsewhere to pay such contributions to the Panathenaea (Hicks 32, 41, 64). *)aqhnai/h| th=| *polia/di. It seems clear that in inscriptions 'Athena Polias' may refer to the goddess of the Parthenon as well as to her of the Erechtheum, the title serving to distinguish the goddess who watches over the city and citadel of Athens from Athena Nike (Wyse, Cl. Rev. xii. 145-52; cf. also D'Ooge, Acropolis, 139-42, 385-9). But in literature Athena Polias naturally means the goddess of the Erechtheum, and here that meaning is made certain by the connexion with Erechtheus. On Erechtheus and his temple cf. viii. 55 n. These offerings to the 'lady' and 'king' of the city of Athens from Epidaurus may be connected with the membership of both cities in the ancient Calaurian Amphictyony (Strabo, 46; Paus. ii. 29. 5). Hence their allegiance to the mother-city, and custom of going thither for justice; such dependence in early times is not in itself improbable, but of course the suits would be few and simple. a)gnwmosu/nh|: temeritas, the opposite of swfrosu/nh. It shows itself as overweening self-confidence (here cf. iv. 93; ix. 41. 4), as obstinacy (vi. 10; ix. 4. 2), as conceit (ix. 3. 1), or merely as want of sense (ii. 172. 2; vii. 9. b 1). a)pe/sthsan. The independence of Aegina must have been absolutely assured when Periander crushed Epidaurus (iii. 52. 7), circ. 600 B. C. u(paire/ontai. By seizing the statues they would not only make themselves independent of the mother-city in their worship, but also secure the blessing of the deities (ch. 75, 81). So Juno is brought (with her own consent) from Veii to Rome (Livy, v. 22). kerto/moisi. Such coarse raillery was customary among worshippers of Demeter and Dionysus in Attica also. It was practised by those who went to Eleusis (gefurismo/s, cf. Arist. Frogs 384 f.), by choruses of men at the feasts of Dionysus (Arist. Wasps 1362; Dem. de Cor. 122ta\\ a)f' a(ma/chs), and by companies of women at the Thesmophoria (*sth/nia, cf. ii. 171. 2 n.). H. implies that men were present in Aegina during this part of the festival (cf. the celebration at Bubastis, ii. 60 n.), though no doubt excluded from the secret rites (a)/rrhtoi i(rorgi/ai), which, as in the worship of Bona Dea and the Thesmophoria (ii. 171. 2 n.), were the essence of the cult. On their significance cf. ch. 82. 1 n. H. puts in the forefront two points in which the Athenian story, dictated perhaps by unwillingness to admit defeat, differed from the Aeginetan, viz. (1) that the Athenians sent only one ship, (2) that they had no intention of making an armed attack, to which we get the Aeginetan answers in ch. 86. Meanwhile, the undisputed fact of the attempt to remove the statues is thrust away into a relative clause, oi(\\ pemfqe/ntes. a)llofronh=sai = here 'were stunned, lost their wits' (cf. Hom. Il. xxiii. 698), whereas in vii. 205. 3 = 'with other thoughts', as in Hom. Od. x. 374. Similarly a)llognw=sai in Hippocrates means 'go mad', but in H. i. 85. 3 'fail to recognize'. For the story in general compare that of the salvation of Delphi (viii. 37-40), those of the madness caused by Artemis (Paus. iii. 16. 9; vii. 19. 3), and above all the attempted rape of the statue of Hera from Samos, and the marvel by which it was prevented (Athen. 672 b). a)nakomisqh=nai au)to/n, 'was conveyed back alone.' ou) naumaxh=sai. The fact was admitted. The Athenian explanation was that no hostility was intended; the Aeginetan, that they preferred to fight on land. H. is slow to believe, though not to record, anything which seemed to him to contradict the laws of nature (cf. iii. 116, iv. 25, and especially iv. 42. 4, and in general Introd. \u00a7 32). sfi, 'before them.' The goddesses were no doubt represented kneeling, and the story is an aetiological myth to explain this (cf. chs. 87, 88; ii. 131). The true explanation (Welcker, Frazer) is that they were goddesses of child-birth. So Latona brought forth Apollo and Artemis kneeling on the soft meadow (Hymn Apollo, 116 f.). In this posture were represented Auge at Tegea (Paus. viii. 48. 7), and the Di Nixi (Festus, pp. 174-7) brought to Rome after the defeat of Antiochus or the sack of Corinth. Marble groups of the kind have been found at Myconus and near Sparta. e(toi/mous poie/esqai, 'had procured the help of the Argives' (i. 11.1), probably as mercenaries (cf. i. 61. 4; vi. 92. 2), though possibly the three Dorian states were leagued against Athens. Epidaurus must have been friendly to Aegina, otherwise it could have stopped the Argives or sent news to Athens. Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff (A. ii. 280 f.) has put forward a theory (somewhat discredited, like the sun-myths of comparative mythologists, by its too frequent use) that this war is a reflection into the distant past of incidents which really occurred in the struggles between Athens and Aegina in the period of the Persian wars. Undoubtedly the incidents, the landing of the Athenians, and their defeat by the Argives and Aeginetans, are more appropriate to that time, as is shown by the mention of a trireme (ch. 85); but the feud between Athens and Aegina seems really old, as is shown by the embargo on Attic pottery (ch. 88), and on the Athenian side by Solon's substitution of the Euboic standard for the Aeginetan in coinage, and by his prohibition of the export of corn (Busolt, ii. 307). H. vaguely takes the story back into the far past, when Epidaurus had lately been mistress of Aegina and friend of Athens (ch. 83), when images were still made of wood (ch. 82), and Attic women still wore Dorian dress (ch. 87. 3). This early war between Athens and Aegina may well have occurred (circ. 590-70 B. C.) when Athens, fresh from her victory over Megara, was ready for a yet bolder enterprise. Internal seditions and renewed troubles with Megara (i. 59 n.) may soon have checked these wider ambitions. With this ferocious act compare the lynching of the wife and children of Lycidas in 479 B. C. by the women of Athens (ix. 5. 3), and the 'Lemnian deeds' recorded in vi. 138. a)/llw| may be taken with o(/tew|, being put forward for emphasis, or being = a)/llo it is attracted into the case of the relative, cf. Il. Greek dress: 'the Ionic', used by the natives of Asia Minor\u2014Phrygians, Lycians, Carians, and the Greeks who came in contact with them; and the Dorian, of which the Corinthian is an unknown variety, the primitive national dress worn by almost all Greeks except the Ionians. The Ionian chiton was a long linen garment like a night-gown, with full sleeves to the elbow, requiring neither brooch nor pin. The Dorian was a square woollen cloth, with the upper edge folded down forming the diplois. It was simply folded round the body and fastened at the shoulder. The right side was thus left unprotected, unless this opening was, as in the Canephorae of the Erectheum, sewn up. (But in all cases a girdle was worn fastened round the loins, and under the girdle the dress could be so arranged as to overlap.) This Dorian chiton served for both outer and under garment, hence it is called i(ma/tion (ch. 87. 2). There is great difficulty as to the dress of the Athenians in early days. Homer includes them among the *)ia/ones e(lkexi/twnes (Il. xiii. 685; cf. Thuc. iii. 104, Hom. hymn), and the men of Athens before the Persian wars wore long linen chitons (Thuc. i. 6 and fastened their hair with golden grasshoppers in the Ionian fashion. It is therefore hard to believe that while the men wore Ionian dress the women wore the Dorian, and that then each sex changed its style of dress. The evidence of monuments seems to show that in the early period of sculpture Ionic dress was common, but that after the Persian wars the Dorian dress prevailed. See P. Gardner, Greek Antiquities, p. 49 f.; Lady Evans, Greek Dress; and Studniczka, Altgriechische Tracht. *ka/eira. Carian influences on Ionia cf. i. 146 n. a)natiqe/nai. The offering would be made either before marriage (for which compare the offering of hair, iv. 34. 1 n.; Paus. i. 43. 4, ii. 32. 1; Frazer) or at child-birth (cf. ch. 86. 3 n.), with which may be compared the dedication of clothes to Artemis Brauronia at Athens (A. Mommsen, Syracuse (Anth. Pal. viii. 200 f.). ke/ramon. Attic pottery was known all over the Greek world for its excellence. Hence this embargo may have been a primitive measure of protection. So far as Argos is concerned it is supported by the results of the American excavations at the Heraeum. Many fragments were found of old varieties, such as the Mycenaean and Geometric wares, some of the later red-figure style prevalent after the Persian wars at Athens, but hardly any of the best period of the black-figure style or the early red-figure style of vases. In other words, the embargo was rigorous circ. 550-480 B. C. See J. C. Hoppin, Cl. R. xii, p. 86. For the use of pottery rather than silver, &c., in the service of the gods cf. Athen. xi. 482; Macrob. Sat. v. 21. manth/ion. This oracle must surely have been given when Aegina was finally conquered, or at least when Athens was bent on the conquest (458-457 B. C.). If so, the thirty years must be reckoned from that epoch, which takes us back to 488-487 B. C., the probable date of the Aeginetan war, misplaced by H. before 490 B. C. (vi. 87 f.). Athens could hardly have meditated the conquest of Aegina before Marathon, and before the building of her great navy. H. is probably guilty of an anachronism in dating the project and the oracle before the Ionic revolt (Macan, Appendix VIII, \u00a7 a)diki/ou. H. reproduces the Athenian colouring of his source by using a term elsewhere only found in Attic legal proceedings. *ai)akw=|.

The allegation that Sparta attempted to cripple a possible rival by destroying her liberties (ch. 78) and restoring tyranny may be derived from Attic tradition. As a rule, Sparta favoured narrow oligarchies as more congenial to her own temper and institutions, and more conformable to her interests (Thuc. i. 19. 76; Ar.

Grote (iv. 101) remarks on the interest and importance of this occasion, the first recorded instance of the consultation of her allies by Sparta. The practice thus begun made the Peloponnesian league a true confederacy, organized probably by the vigorous and successful king, Cleomenes (cf. Appendix XVII, \u00a7 3). The necessity of such consultations was shown by the dispersion of the allies during the last campaign against Athens (ch. 75). *swsikle/hs. There seems no doubt that Corinth again (cf. ch. 75) led the opposition to the Spartan proposal, since she needed an independent Athens as a counterweight to Aegina, and for the maintenance of her own freedom. On her southern border she was already hemmed in by cities subservient to Sparta; were Athens now to become a submissive subject of Lacedaemon, Corinthian liberty and even Corinthian commerce would be menaced. Sosicles may be an historical person, like the seven Persian conspirators (iii. 80 f.), but his speech is incredibly inapt to the occasion, and is no more historical than the political essays put in their mouths. The one good point is the inconsistency of Sparta's hostility to tyranny at home and support of a tyrant abroad, and this might have been improved by recalling the Spartan suppression of tyrants (cf. Appendix XVI, \u00a7 10). Of the stories told, that of Cypselus' childhood is not in point, since it does not illustrate the evils of tyranny, nor is there any attempt to show that a tyranny at Athens would injure Sparta or her allies. H., even in his set speeches, does not cease to be a story-teller, using the narrative style (ei)rome/nh le/cis) suitable to the matter; he cannot, like Thucydides, give us the weighty political argument demanded by the crisis. We may further note his light-hearted assurance that he gives the actual words spoken (ta/de in contrast with the more cautious phrases of Thucydides (toiau=ta, toia/de).

Hal. vi. 95) was fraudulently misused (H. iv. 201. 2, 3). i)sokrati/as: concrete = 'republics,' a word coined to avoid the use of 'democracies', which might be distasteful to the Spartans, the equivalent of the abstract term i)shgori/h (ch. 78) and the commoner i)sonomi/h (iii. 80. 6, 142. 3; v. 37. 2). fula/ssontes. The dual monarchy was itself a precaution against tyranny. Further, to provide against a dangerous personal preeminence was a constant principle of Spartan policy; hence the treatment of Cleomenes and Pausanias, and in later days of Lysander. Not till Sparta was in her last decline did king Cleomenes III win despotic power, to be followed by Machanidas, and Nabis (221-192 B. C.) (Plass. Tyrannis, ii. 171 f.). On the putting down of tyranny by Sparta cf. Appendix XVI, \u00a7 10. Here begins the tale of the Cypselids in three parts:\u20141. The saving of Cypselus; 2. The advice of Thrasybulus; 3. The ghost of Melissa. The accepted tradition, which has been largely rationalized, ran thus. At the time of the Dorian invasion the Heracleid Aletes became king in Corinth in place of the Sisyphid (Paus. ii. 4. 3, 4; Thuc. iv. 42). Ten Dorian kings reigned before the monarchy gave way to the oligarchy of the Bacchiadae, whose clan of two hundred or more families took its name from the fifth king Bacchis. After the death of the last king Telestes, annual Prytaneis were elected from the ruling race for ninety years (747-657 B. C.). But the whole scheme is highly artificial and due to late chronologists (Busolt, i. 631 f.). e)di/dosan kai\\ h)/gonto: the formal expression for e)pigami/a, conubium, though is more regular (ii. 196. 4; iv. 145. 5; Thuc. viii. 21). Legitimate marriage was clearly impossible outside the ruling clan, just as at Rome in early days there was no conubium between patrician and plebeian. Such close aristocracies claiming descent from a royal house were common (Whibley, Greek Oligarchies, p. 120 f.). They tended to become the narrowest of despotic oligarchies (dunastei=ai, Thuc. iii. 62; iv. 78; Ar. a 24), resembling real tyrannies. Cf. a)ndra/si mouna/rxoisiinfra. *la/bda. So called because her deformity the letter *l (Etym. Mag. 199). Perhaps the lameness is symbolic (cf. iv. 161; Xen. Hell. iii. 3. 3). dh/mou. Perhaps influenced by Attic usage; cf. . &c. in Elis, Rhodes, &c., outside Attica; for a collection of instances cf. Pauly-Wissowa s. v. Petra probably lay south of Corinth on the northern slope of the Argive hills near Tenea. *lapi/qhs te kai\\ *kainei/dhs: generic te kai\\ *nhlei=dai. Caeneus, the invulnerable Lapith, was slain by the weight of the trees hurled on him by the Centaurs in the fight at the wedding of Pirithous. The Lapiths are a prae-Hellenic Thessalian race; but, according to Paus. ii. 4. 4, v. 18. 7, the Cypselids sprang from Melas, son of Antasus, a man of Gonoessa above Sicyon, whom Aletes, in spite of a warning from an oracle, suffered to come to Corinth. In any case, Eetion belonged to the prae-Dorian 'Aeolic' population of Corinth (Thuc. iv. 42), the tyrannis, as usual in Peloponnese, marking an anti-Dorian reaction on the part of the conquered race. ou)de/, 'he had no children by this or any other woman.' Cf. i. 215. 2; ii. 52. 1, and 2. A play on the synonym Petra, as the line before is on Eetion. dikaiw/sei. Here = 'chastise', as shown by l. 14. Cf. i. 100. 2; iii. 29. 3. leo/nta. The lion is a symbol of royal power, vi. 131. 2, and perhaps v. 56. 1, vii. 225. 2. Corinth is called the city of Pirene (Pind. Ol. xiii. 161), but the site of the spring is uncertain. The Pirene of Strabo (379) (cf. Paus. ii. 5. 1; Frazer, iii. 32) is on Acro-Corinthus, a quarter of an hour from the summit by the east wall of the fortifications. The Pirene of Pausanias (ii. 3. 2) is in Old-Corinth at the foot of Acro-Corinthus, on the road from Lechaeum to the market-place, south-east of the well-known temple of Apollo. The latter Romanized fountain of Pirene has been thoroughly excavated by Professor Richardson, of the American school at Athens, who showed it me in 1899. See J. H. S. xix, p. 324; xx. 175; Century Magazine, March, 1899. o)fruo/enta, 'on a brow,' probably of the towering Acro-Corinthus, though the town itself stood on a rocky plateau two hundred feet above the plain. Cf. Il. xxii. of Labda and her baby illustrates the tender and kindly feeling for children in Greece (Mahaffy, S. L., p. 163 f.). Nic. Damasc. (fr. 58), F. H. G. iii. 391 gives a rationalized version of this story, explaining the connexion with Olympia, at Olympia a chest (la/rnac) of cedar, whose carvings and decorations he describes in full, believing it to be the hiding-place of Cypselus. This seems impossible, as a kuye/lh, to judge from the coins of Cypsela in Thrace, is a cylindrical jar, and the chest seems, from the account of its carvings and inscriptions, not to be earlier than 600 B. C. Probably the legend here given arose out of the name Cypselus, but the magnificent coffer seen by Pausanias may well have been, like the golden image of Zeus (Paus. v. 2. 3), a gift of the Corinthian tyrants. On the reconstructions of this famous monument of archaic art cf. Stuart Jones, J. H. S. xiv. 30, 80, and the summary of his (and other) views in Frazer, Paus. iii. 600 f. a)mfide/cion. Since the oracle is in no sense ambiguous this is best taken as two-handed, that is, two-edged (cf. a)mfh/khs), in the sense that while promising success to Cypselus and his sons, the oracle also prophesies the deposition of his grandsons. Nevertheless, since decio/s is used of favourable omens, Stein (following Erotian, voc. successor was Psammetichus, son of his brother Gorgus, who only reigned three years (Ar. Pol. v. 12. 1315 b 26; Nic. Dam. fr. 60, F. H. G. iii. 393). The precision of this prophecy shows it was made after the event. This is the conventional picture of the tyrant (cf. iii. 80 f.). Aristotle (Pol. v. 10. 12) and Nic. Damasc. (fr. 58), F. H. G. iii. 391 make Cypselus the popular leader (dhmagwgo/s), gaining and keeping power by the arts of a demagogue, unlike his harsher successor. See Appendix XVI. 3. trih/konta e)/tea. Aristotle (Pol. v. 12. 1315 b 22 f.) assigns 73 1/2 years to the dynasty, 30 to Cypselus, 44 (? 40 1/2) to Periander, 3 to Psammetichus. Busolt (i. 638 f.) takes 657 as the date of Cypselus' accession, 586-5 for the death of Periander. *qrasubou/lw|: cf. i. 20 f. Since Periander was one of the seven Sages, and a greater adept in the arts of tyranny than Thrasybulus, Aristotle (Pol. iii. 13. 1284 a 26 f.; v. 10. 1311 a 20) reverses the parts of the two despots. The story illustrates the truth that the opposite of Tyranny is Oligarchy rather than Democracy. Roman annalists apply the Greek tale less appropriately to Tarquinius Superbus and his son Sextus during his stay at Gabii (Liv. i. 54). a)napodi/zwn, 'making him go back' (cf. ii. 116. 2 n.; Aesch. in Ctes. 192), i. e. cross-examining him concerning. Divination for buried treasure is a familiar process burlesqued by Scott (Antiquary, ch. 21). *me/lissa: killed, probably accidentally, by her husband (iii. 50 f.). Her real name was Lysicle, Melissa being a name given her by Periander (Diog. Laert. i. 94), or a title as priestess of some goddess (Pind. Pyth. iv. 60, Schol.; Frazer, Paus. iv. 223, v. 621; J. H. S. xv. 11). For the geography 47. 1; 5. 'The Acheron flows through a profound and gloomy gorge, one of the darkest and deepest of the glens of Greece' (Leake, N. G. i. 241). Hence it was a spot likely to be accounted a descent into hell, where the ghost might be summoned back as was Samuel by the witch of Endor (1 Sam. 28). Other oracles of the dead were at Phigalea (Paus. iii. 17. 9; cf. Frazer), Heraclea Pontica (Plut. Cim. 6), and Taenarum (Plut. Mor. 560 E). On the custom of burning or burying with the dead clothes, &c., cf. iv. 71 n. to\\ *(/hraion. Clearly the shrine of *(/hra bounai/a, on the slope of Acro-Corinthus at the west end of the city (Paus. ii. 4. 7), not the distant temple on the headland of Peiraeum (Xen. Hell. iv. 5. 5). o)/rugma: as an offering to the dead (Hom. Od. xi. 25; x. 517) For the similar custom of pouring offerings into the grave through a hole cf. Paus. x. 4. 10, with Frazer; Ridgeway, Origin of Tragedy, 30 f. kate/kaie. This admirable instance of animism is rationalized by Ephorus (Diog. Laert. i. 96), who makes Periander plunder the ladies of Corinth to get gold for the colossal statue of Zeus at Olympia (cf. e 1 n.). So Blakesley and Rawlinson think the clothes were burnt to get the inwrought gold! A similar tale is told of Dionysius the younger (Justin, xxi. 3). qeou\\s *(ellhni/ous. Cf. ii. 178 n. h(me/rai, &c., 'the appointed days.' No doubt the antagonism between Corinth and Athens, which began with Themistocles' creation of a great navy, became embittered by the adhesion of Megara to Athens (Thuc. i. 105) and the conquest of Aegina (circ. 458 B. C.), and culminated in the Peloponnesian war, might have been foreseen, but probably the prophecy is post eventum. At this time Corinth feared Aegina more, and supported Athens on several occasions by thwarting Spartan designs (here and ch. 75), by arbitrating in her favour as regards Plataea (vi. 108), and by the loan of ships for the Aeginetan war (vi. 89; Thuc. i. 41). Commercial interest dictated both the earlier friendship and the later hostility. On the acquaintance of the Pisistratidae with oracles cf. Appendix XVI, \u00a7 7. Hippias returns to Sigeum. Digression on the war between Athens and Mitylene for Sigeum. Artaphrenes insists that Athens must receive Hippias back. *)amu/nths: cf. ch. 17. His connexion with the Pisistratidae (only here indicated) may have arisen from Pisistratus' possessions on the Strymon and the Thermaic gulf (Ath.

Thuc. ii. 99, 100). *qessaloi\\ (cf. ch. 63) *)iwlko/n: on the Pagasaean gulf, suitable for a naval power. no/qon: illegitimate, since his mother Timonassa was an Argive and could not contract a legal marriage with Pisistratus. A difficulty arises, because while Thucydides (vi. 55) recognizes three legitimate sons of Pisistratus\u2014Hippias, Hipparchus, and Thessalus, as recorded on the stele in the Acropolis\u2014Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 17) states that only Hippias and Hipparchus were sons of his lawful wife, while Iophon and Hegesistratus, whose other name was Thessalus, were born of an Argive. The best solution is due to Toepffer (Beitrage, p. 251 f.). He holds that Hegesistratus, illegitimate by birth, was afterwards legitimized under the name of Thessalus, which name accordingly he bears later in Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 18 and in the decree of a)timi/a against the tyrants (Thuc. vi. 55). Iophon, on the other hand, was never legitimized, and was therefore unmentioned in the decree. *(hghsi/straton. This name was given him for the part he took in leading the Argive allies in the battle of Pallene (i. 62; Ath. Pol. 17); that of Thessalus is doubtless a compliment to the Thessalian allies of Athens (ch. 63). e)/k te *)axillhi/ou. The tomb of Achilles, near the mouth of the Scamander (Strabo 600). ou)/te sugginwsko/menoi, 'not acknowledging their claim but, showing,' though the district was studded with Lesbian colonies, Athens claimed it (Aesch. Eum. 397). lo/gw|: by an argument (cf. i. 129. 3), taken no doubt from Homer, and similar to those used to prove that Salamis belonged to Athens (Plut. Sol. 10; Il. ii. 558) and to support her claims to precedence (vii. 161; ix. 27). *)alkai=os. Beloch (Gr. G. i. 330) holds to his peculiar opinion (Rhein. Mus. xlv. 465 ff.) that this synchronism between Alcaeus and Pisistratus is historical, and that there was no earlier war between Athens and Mitylene. Toepffer, on the other hand, follows Valckenaer in contending that H. here is recapitulating episodically the earlier history of the quarrel, and is quite aware there were two wars (Toepffer, Beitrage, p. 63, 240 f.); but E. Meyer (ii, \u00a7 402) rightly follows Grote in arguing that H. has unconsciously confused (1) the struggles of the time of Alcaeus, (2) the award of Periander, (3) the renewed wars in the times of Pisistratus and his sons. H.'s chronology of the sixth century, frequently confused and inaccurate (Appendix XV, \u00a7 6; Abbott, Exc. xi), is in this case self-contradictory. Periander's award cannot be later than 585 B. C., as he died about that time, and Hegesistratus was born after Pisistratus had become tyrant at Athens, circ. 560-555 (Ath. Pol. 17). We must then suppose that there was an earlier war in which (circ. 600 B. C.) Alcaeus lost his shield, and Pittacus of Mitylene, by the arts of the retiarius, vanquished the Athenian Phrynon in single combat (Strabo 599, 600), a fact whose omission Plutarch (Moralia 858 B) ascribes to the malevolence of H. This war was ended by the well-attested mediation of Periander (Ar. Rhet. i. 15; Diog. Laert. i. 74) before 590 B. C., and left the Athenians in possession of Sigeum. A memorial of their dominion there is the Attic inscription on the stele of Phanodikos the Proconnesian found there (Roehl, I. G. A. 492; Hicks, No. 8), which must be as early as the first quarter of the sixth century (Roberts, No. 42; Greek Epigraphy, p. 334). At some later time Athens lost possession of Sigeum, but regained it during the last tyranny of Pisistratus (circ. 535 B. C.). The attempt of the Athenians to get a foothold on the Hellespont before they were secure even of Salamis may be explained by the great value of the Pontic corn-trade to an impoverished Attica (Ath. Pol. 2), and a desire to deprive Megara of this source of wealth. For the expansion of Athenian power under Pisistratus cf. Appendix XVI, \u00a7 8; for arbitration, v. 28 n. e)pitiqei=, 'sends.' Cf. iii. 42 ad fin. A corrupt fragment of the poem is given by Strabo (600). Archilochus (fr. 6), Anacreon (fr. 28), and Horace (Odes ii. 7. 9) record similar misfortunes. Aristagoras induces Athens and Eretria to send aid, and the Paeonians to return to Europe. The Greeks burn Sardis, and as they retreat are defeated at Ephesus. e)n tou/tw| tw=| kairw=|: i. e. 499 B.

If this speech were historical, this would be the earliest recognition of Athens as the mother-city of Ionia (Macan), though the idea may have inspired the ambitions of Pisistratus (Appendix XVI, \u00a7 8). The claim was supported by exploiting tradition and genealogies in the interest of politics (cf. i. 142, 147; v. 62 nn.). pollou\\s e(/na. The malicious suggestion that it was easier to impose on the whole people of Athens than on a single Spartan may well come from a Spartan source; but cf. i. 60. 3. 'The remark is a glaring instance of the political na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Herodotus' (Macan). Throughout he treats the Ionic revolt as a scheme of desperate adventurers fraught with evils to Hellas (\u00a7 3, ch. 28, vi. 3). Yet on his own showing the conquest of Greece was already projected at the Persian court (iii. 134), and Athens in particular was plainly threatened (chs. 73, 96). The action of Athens did but forestall an inevitable attack, and facilitated later the formation of the Delian confederacy (ix. 106 n.; viii. 3). Her fault lay not in supporting the Ionians now, but in deserting them later (ch. 103). trei=s muria/das. This was the conventional estimate of the number of citizens in the days of H.: and is repeated (viii. 65. 1) for the Eleusinian procession, and (Arist. Eccles. 1132, Plato, Sympos. 175 E) for the audience in the theatre. The first authentic census gives the number of 21,000 for 317 B. C., but there is little doubt that the numbers were greater in Periclean and even in Cleisthenean Athens. The number of those receiving state pay (Ath. Pol. 24), and of those to be billeted on the allies (Arist. Vesp. 708), is put at 20,000; and 14,240 received the dole of coin in 444 B. C. (Plut. Per. 37). Beloch (Bev. ch. 3) would put the number of citizens in 431 B. C. at 35,000, and in 500 B. C. at 30,000; while Meyer (F. ii. 179), who accepts the 29,000 hoplites (including metics) stated by Thucydides (ii. 13) to have been on the musterrolls in 431 B. C., reaches much higher totals\u201455,500 for 431 B. C. and nearly 50,000 for 500 B. C. This last estimate must surely be exaggerated, but that of H. may be roughly correct. Of course, no such number ever attended the Assembly, five or six thousand (Thuc. viii. 72) being a full house. a)rxh\\ kakw=n. For the formula cf. Il. v. 62, xi. 604; Thuc. ii. 12; also ch. 28 and vi. 67. 3. Plutarch's criticism (de Mal. Her. 24) of this dictum is for once just as well 1. *dori/skon. A landing at Doriscus seems unlikely, since it was a strong place (vii. 106) held by a Persian garrison (vii. 59). Moreover, Doriscus on the Hebrus is far from the home of the Paeonians on the Strymon (cf. the march of Xerxes, vii. 108-13). The long struggle between Chalcis and Eretria for the Lelantine plain, which culminated in a war of pan-Hellenic importance (Thuc. i. 15), would seem to belong to the seventh century. The war between the two principals was fought out with sword and lance (Archil. fr. 4; Strabo 448) by their knightly 1289 b 36), the Thessalians helping Chalcis to gain the victory (Plut. Mor. 760 f.). But the war was far more than a border feud: it was a struggle between two rival commercial leagues. Eretria was supported by Miletus, and probably by Megara and Aegina, while Chalcis had the help of Samos and Corinth. In the far West, Sybaris was allied to Miletus (vi. 21 n.), and Croton to Samos. Probably the rival Euboean cities were the channels through which the Eastern Greeks could trade with the West. Cf. iii. 59. 4 n.; Busolt, i. 456; Meyer, ii, \u00a7 342. Eretria lost all importance for the time, and Chalcis was hardly recompensed for her losses by supremacy not only in Euboea but in the Thracian and Western colonies. H. lets us see the importance of the contingent from Eretria and of the tie between Eretria and Miletus. He also constantly affirms that the expedition of Datis was directed against Eretria as well as Athens (vi. 43, 94, 98 f.). Myres (J. H. S. xxvi. 96) connects this activity of Eretria with its thalassocracy 505-490 B. C., and suggests that Eretria also had a hand in the great defeat of the Boeotian and Chalcidians (v. 77), which H. represents as a purely Athenian victory. strathgou\\s a)pe/dece. Aristagoras seems to act as if he were still tyrant (cf. chs. 38, 49, 98). *korh|sw=|. Coresus was a hill south of the river Cayster. The Ephesians seem to have lived on its slopes till moved down into the plain near the Artemisium by Croesus (Strabo 640), and to have returned there in the days of Alexander or of Lysimachus. West of the hill was the principal port of Ephesus down to Attalid times: at least Thrasyllus landed there in 408 B. C. (Xen. Hell. i. 2. 7). For a plan of recent excavations cf. Pauly Wissowa v. 2780. h(gemo/nas. The regular road (ch. 54) led up the Cayster and over Mount Tmolus by the pass of Kara Bel: but clearly the Ionians marched by mountain paths to surprise the enemy, otherwise guides would be unnecessary. ou)deno\\s a)ntiwqe/ntos. Plutarch (de Malig. 24, Mor. 861) states that the Persians were besieging Miletus, and that the object of the attack on Sardis was to raise the siege. If the Persians were busy elsewhere, we can better understand Artaphernes being caught unprepared and retiring to the citadel. But the story is quite inconsistent with H. a)kropo/lios. For the topography of Sardis cf. i. 80 n. po/lin. This is clearly identical with to\\ a)/stu (\u00a7 1 ad fin.), 'the lower city.' Hence the same meaning must be given to e)n th=| po/li (\u00a7 2 ad init.), though Stein and Macan there construe 'Acropolis'. There is no reason to believe that there were Lydians in the Acropolis, or that all the Persians were within its walls. Nor could a fire in the lower city compel the garrison of the Acropolis to come down to the Agora and defend themselves there. su\\n plh/qei+ prosferome/nous. If H. means the reinforcements of ch. 102 he writes loosely. Probably he refers to the garrison of the Acropolis called (ch. 100 at Pessinus, the mh/thr *dindumh/nh of i. 80. 1. For the Anatolian 'Great Mother' cf. App. I. 2, Frazer, G. B. iv, Bk. II, Attis, &c.; Ramsay, in Hastings' Bible Dictionary, extra vol., p. 120 f. The Atys myth which involved her cult is connected with Sardis by H.'s story of the son of Croesus (i. 34. 2 n.). The Great Mother was worshipped at Athens in the days of Sophocles (Phil. 391), and identified by the Greeks with Rhea, mother of the gods (cf. iv. 76; Strabo 469), with Aphrodite, with Demeter, and with Artemis as the lady of the wild woods. But here she is regarded as a foreign goddess. to\\ skhpto/menoi. This motive is again put forward vii. 8, b 3, and on the occasion of the destruction of Eretria (vi. 101. 3). The Persians burned temples at Branchidae (vi. 19. 3), Naxos (vi. 96. 1), Abae (viii. 33), and Athens (viii. 53. 2). But they spared Delos (vi. 97) and probably Delphi (ix. 42. 3). Cf. also Troy (vii. 43) and Halos (vii. 197). The Persians needed no excuse for destroying Hellenic shrines (cf. Appendix VIII, \u00a7 4), and the accidental destruction of a Lydian temple was clearly not the reason. nomou\\s e)/xontes. This should naturally refer to the three satrapies (iii. 90), but the Persians who put down the revolt\u2014Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes\u2014were generals, not satraps (chs. 116-17, 122; ch. 25. 1 n., App. VI, \u00a7 7). stefanhfo/rous.

It is far more probable that the withdrawal of Athens, like the abstention of Sparta from all part in the war (Appendix XVII, \u00a7 3), was caused by more pressing needs nearer home. Twenty ships could not be kept permanently across the Aegean while Aegina with a superior navy (vi. 89) controlled the Saronic gulf. It may be, too, that the patriotic party had lost power at Athens. In 496-495 Hipparchus, son of Charmus, the leader of the Pisistratids, was elected first archon (Dion. Hal. v. 77; vi. 1; cf. Ar. Ath. Pol. 22), and the Alcmaeonids seem to have been willing both earlier and later (ch. 73 n.; Appendix XVIII, \u00a7 6) to make terms with Persia. Miltiades had not yet returned from the Chersonese to lead the patriots, though there must have been many at Athens reluctant to leave Miletus to its fate (cf. vi. 21 n.). *buza/ntion: as a Megarian colony unconnected with Ionia, but ready to throw off the Persian yoke (cf. v. 26 n.). ta\\s a)/llas: cf. v. 117; vi. 33. e)kplw/santes to\\n *(ellh/sponton.

Cyprus had submitted to Persia (iii. 91) with Phoenicia, when Egypt, on which it had been dependent in the days of Amasis (ii. 182), was tottering to its fall. Esar-haddon (circ. 675 B. C.) enumerates ten vassal kings of Cyprus, among them the lords of Curium, Paphos, and probably Soli and Citium. Diodorus (xvi. 42) gives nine chief cities Citium, Marium, Amathus, Soli, Curium, and Amathus are mentioned by H. Salamis, as in the days of Evagoras, seems to be the head of the Hellenic faction, Amathus (Hamath) of the native or Phoenician. Cyprus, after sharing in Aegean culture, developed a mixed Greek and Phoenician civilization of its own. Cf. Excavations in Cyprus (B. M.), at Paphos (J. H. S. ix. 147 f.), and at Salamis (J. H. S. xii. 59 f.); Myres, Catalogue of the Cyprus Museum. H. gives us the following genealogy of the kings of Salamis: But Euelthon is king in the days of Arcesilaus III of Cyrene (iv. 162); so it is hardly possible that his great-grandson should have reached man's estate in 498 B. C. It has therefore been suggested that Siromus (= Hiram) is the king of Tyre (circ. 550-530 B. C.), vii. 98, erroneously thrust into the line of Greek princes. *)iw/nwn ou)de/na lo/gon.

Double battle of Salamis. Persian victory on land, and reconquest of Cyprus. Cyprus is the key of the Levant (Grundy, p. 105). Thence the Greeks could threaten the communications of Persia with the West, since 'the only really practicable military line of communication' touches the shore of the Levant at the corner commanded by Cyprus. They could also block the advance of the Phoenician fleet to the Aegean. Its strategic value both for attack and defence led Pausanias in 478 B. C. (Thuc. i. 94) and the Athenians, both in 459 B. C. (Thuc. i. 104) and in 449 B. C. (Thuc. i. 112), again to attempt its liberation. a)/krhn.

This Pan-Ionic council is a revival of that at work fifty years before (i. 141). Its direction of affairs is implied in the brief deliberation of ch. 108. 2; cf. vi. 7. P. Gardner (J. H.

There is some humour in the airs of superiority attributed to the Ionians. 'To avoid facing the Persian infantry (cf. vi. 112) on the plea of discipline (cf. vi. 12), and to remind the men of Cyprus of their servitude to the Mede (cf. iv. 142), are malicious touches in H.'s Ionian portraiture' (Macan).

There were nine hereditary princes (Diod. xvi. 42), one in each of the cities named in ch. 104 n. The Carians were adepts in war (i. 171 n.). For their courage cf. ch. 118 f. For the ghastly wounds inflicted by a fighting horse cf. Marbot's story of the battle of Eylau (Memoirs E. T., p. 215). H., who is imbued with the spirit of Romance, here voices the prevailing sentiment of mediaeval chivalry. Cf. Virg. Aen. battle of Salamis in 449 B. C.

H. seems uncertain of the Argive colonization of in legend is Eastern. Probably Peloponnesians really settled in Cyprus in prehistoric times, since Mycenaean pottery is common there, and the Cypriote dialect resembles most closely the Arcadian, the earliest Peloponnesian tongue. Further, the existence of the Cypriote syllabary shows that the colonization took place before the adoption of the alphabet (Busolt, i. 318 f.). polemisth/ria a(/rmata. Meyer (i, \u00a7\u00a7 455, 577) derives both horse and war chariot from invading Aryans. Whatever be the origin of the horse (cf. Ridgway, Thorough-bred Horse), the war-chariot seems to have spread through Western Asia circ. 1600 B. C., perhaps from the Hittites, to Egypt, Crete, and Greece. It long held its own against cavalry, since it was better suited for archers (e. g. Hittites and Egyptians), and ages passed before men devised weapons and armour suitable for use on horseback (Ridgway, pp. 481-2). But the chariot is unknown in Greek warfare after Homer, since its use in processions at Eretria (Strabo 448) proves nothing. Its survival in Cyprus may be due to oriental influence: indeed, it is tempting to see in the treacherous charioteers an oriental element in the population. Scythed chariots seem to be a later Persian invention used at Cunaxa (Xen. An. i. 8. 10). (See note, p. 415.) *soli/wn. Soli was believed to be an Athenian Colony (Strabo 683; Plut. Solon 26). The visit of Solon to Soli, and the rebuilding of the city on the plain instead of on the height (ai)pei=a), is recorded in one of his circ. 590-580 B. C., and cannot have been later than 560 B. C. It is therefore remarkable that a son of his friend should still be on the throne and killed in battle in 497 B. C. w(s h(/rwi. For such honours to a dead enemy cf. ch. 47. 2 n.; and for a similar command from an oracle, the curious case of Cleomedes of Astypalaea (492 B. C.), cf. Paus. vi. 9. 6 f. me/xri e)meu=. The phrase simply means 'to my time', and need not imply a visit to Cyprus (cf. Introd. \u00a7 16). poliorkeume/nh. Idalium, too, appears to have stood a long siege, as we learn from the bilingual bronze tablet referring to the work of the surgeon Onasilus and his brother when the Medes and men of Citium besieged Idalium (G. D. I. i. 60). u(poru/ssontes. Mining seems to have been a favourite Persian operation (cf. iv. 200. 2, vi. 18), learnt perhaps from the Assyrians and Babylonians. Suppression of the revolt on the Hellespont (117) in the Troad and Aeolis (122-3). Hard fighting in Caria. e)niauto/n. The one year of Cyprian liberty and the fall of Miletus in the sixth year of the revolt (vi. 18) are the two definite notes of time in H.; cf. v. 33 n. katededou/lwnto. The tense must not be taken to mean that the reconquest of Cyprus preceded the events next described, since its revolt followed the battle related ch. 102, now again mentioned. Probably the defeat of the Ionians was not so complete as is here implied; certainly the burning of Sardis had destroyed Persian prestige and encouraged revolt. But the story of a naval victory in the Pamphylian sea, and of Eretrian exploits (taken by Plut. de Mal. H. 24 from Lysanias), can hardly be reconciled with H.'s narrative. *)ota/nhs. For satraps and generals in Asia Minor cf. ch. 25 n. and App. VI. 7. The practice of marrying the king's daughters to prominent nobles was intended to attach them to the throne and so strengthen the royal power. The Hellespontine cities are enumerated in geographical order from south-west to north-east, i. e. the order in which a force advancing from Sardis would naturally attack them. H. is here probably recording stories heard at his first home, Halicarnassus; cf. the prominence of Artemisia (viii. 68-9, 87-8, 101-3). *leuka\\s sth/las: unidentified as yet, is shown to be near the Marsyas by the use of te kai/ (ch. 101. 2; i. 2. 2). The Carian Marsyas, the modern China Chai, must be distinguished from the better-known Phrygian tributary of the Maeander (vii. 26. xw/rhs. Its capital, Idrias or Chrysaoris (Paus. v. 21. 10), later called Stratonicea, is now Eski Hissar. In the neighbourhood was a temple of Zeus Chrysaoreus, at which the Carian league met (Strabo 660), but this confederacy appears to belong to a later age (Hicks, J.H.S. xi. 117). To H., Mylasa (i. 171) and Labraunda (ch. 119) are the great Carian shrines. Pixodarus, son of Mausolus, is presumably a Carian dynast, forefather of the man commemorated by the famous Mausoleum, who ruled at Mylasa, and later (B. C. 377-353) in Halicarnassus (Strabo 656). Another Pixodarus reigned B. C. 341-335 (Head, H. N. 630). Cindye is near Bargylia (Strabo 658), probably at Sirtmesh Kale, a Carian fortress (J. H. S. xvi. 196). *suenne/sios: cf. i. 74. 3 n.; vii. 98; ix. 107. 3 n. dhladh\\ w(s ou)k shows that the sentence is not final, but records the opinion that they will be driven into the river and never return home.

Eth. iii. 8. 5, with Schol. The Carians apparently were defeated on the low ground near the junction of the Marsyas and Maeander. They retreated towards Mylasa, but rallied to defend the sanctuary of Labraunda, perhaps disputing the pass from the basin of the Marsyas to that of Mylasa near Alinda (J. H. S. xvi. 192). There were apparently three temples of Zeus be worshipped under three forms: Zeus Karios (cf. i. 171), Zeus Stratios or Labraundeus, and Zeus Osogos (Farnell, Cults, i. 170), but the three forms seem sometimes to be confounded together. Zeus Labraundeus is clearly the Carian war-god, carrying the double-axe (*la/brus, Plut. Mor. 301 F), often depicted on coins of this region (Head, B. M. Cat. Lydia, p. cxxviii). The name Labraunda is clearly derived from *la/brus; perhaps *labu/rinqos too may be formed from the same root, as the double-axe is a frequent symbol for the deity in the palace of Knossos discovered by A. J. Evans. Cf. Burrows, Discoveries in Crete, 110 f. The double-axe seems also to be one of the attributes of the Hittite god Tesub (cf. E. Meyer, i. 479, 481). to\\ trw=ma 109. 2; Diod. xvi. 19.

Presumably a Mermnad (cf. i. 7 n. and vii. 27. 1 n.). *(hraklei/dhs. The recently discovered fragment of Sosylus, a Spartan who taught Hannibal Greek (Polyb. iii. 20. 5; Nepos, Han. 13), alleges that Heraclides won a victory at Artemisium, defeating the Phoenician diekplou=s by having a second line in reserve ready to attack them as soon as they had penetrated the first line. Whether this refers to the well-known battle (Wilcken, Hermes, xli. 103 f., xlii. 512), or to some unknown combat during the Ionic revolt (R\u00fchl, Rhein. Mus. lxi. 352 f.), cannot be determined (Tarn, J. H. S. xxviii. 216). Munro (C. A. H. iv. 289) holds that Heraclides helped the Massaliots to defeat the Carthaginians off the Iberian Artemisium (Dianium). *)ibanw/llios: cf. ch. 37. 1. *ki/os: a Milesian colony (like most towns on this coast), was in later times reckoned Bithynian (Strabo 564; Ptolemy, v. 1). *ge/rgiqas: vii. 43. 2 n. e)ta/xqhsan. The phrase probably implies that the plan of operations was devised at Susa, not by the satrap Artaphrenes. Apparently the campaign against Ionia is roughly synchronous with those by which the Hellespont and Caria were recovered. Flight and death of Aristagoras. H., who consistently depreciates the Ionic revolt (ch. 28, 97 n.; vi. 3 n.), naturally regards its authors as untrustworthy adventurers. Aristagoras is moved to action by his own financial difficulties, and fear of losing his tyranny (ch. 35). He has a glib tongue to deceive the multitude (v. 97) and a bribe for the Spartan king (v. 51), but he takes no active part in warfare, e.g. in the march on Sardis (v. 99) or the expedition to Cyprus (v. 108 f.). Here he is represented as a coward deserting those he has led into danger. But it would seem probable that discontent had been rife in Western Asia Minor since 512 B. C. (iv. 137), and that there was a widespread movement against the local tyrants imposed by Persia (v. 37), the message of Histiaeus (v. 35) being merely the signal and the expedition to Naxos the opportunity for a premeditated rising (cf. ch. 36 n.; Grundy, p. 84 f.). Aristagoras may have been merely the mouthpiece of the general discontent or the agent of Histiaeus, but the wide extent and initial success of the revolt shows that it was something more than a plot of selfish intriguers. *le/ron: a small island some thirty miles south-west of Miletus, colonized thence (Strabo 635). The suggestion of Hecataeus seems absurd, though there was perhaps more hope of defeating the Phoenician fleet than the Persian army which threatened Miletus. The date which suits H.'s narrative best, 497 B. C. (cf. what is said of Histiaeus, v. 108. 1, vi. 1. 1), is rendered certain by chronological data supplied by Thucydides (iv. 102), who reckons sixty years between the Athenian foundation of Amphipolis in 437-436 B. C. (Diod. xii. 32) and the attempt of Aristagoras (cf. Busolt, iii. 199 f.). po/lin: almost certainly *)enne/a *(odoi/ (vii. 114), the later Amphipolis (Thuc. iv. 102). The vagueness of H.'s topography, both here and in ix. 75 n., makes it probable that he wrote these passages before 437 B. C. BOOK VI The intrigues of Histiaeus in Ionia. It is worth noticing that H., who elsewhere insists on the part played by Aristagoras (v. 28, 30 f., 98), here seems to regard the intrigues of Histiaeus as not merely the occasion (v. 35, 124 n.) but the cause of the revolt. Histiaeus was a man of wide ambitions (v. 23 n., 106), but his aims are obscure. Anxious to escape from his gilded captivity (v. 35), he has no policy but opportunist selfseeking. His earlier loyalty to Darius was interested (iv. 137 f.), and apparently he would even now have been willing to re-establish himself in Miletus (v. 106) as the great king's viceroy of Ionia. Hampered by the opposition of Artaphrenes and by his exclusion from Miletus, he escaped captivity or death in Chios by claiming to be the author of the national revolt. Eventually distrusted by both sides, he became a mere free-lance and perished miserably. For a more favourable view of him, resting largely on conjecture, cf. Klio ix. 341-51. kako\\n tosou=ton. No Ionian would at the time have thus described their great struggle for freedom, undertaken of their own free will, but H., after the event, endorsed the shallow view that the revolt was a blunder, if not a crime (v. 28, 97 n., 124). au)toi=si grammatically goes with e)ce/faine, but, as is shown by position, also qualifies th\\n . . . ai)ti/hn, 'what was the true cause that brought the revolt on them.' This tale of intended transportation was a happy invention in view of the Persians' dealings with Barca (iv. 204), the Paeonians (v. 12 n., 14), and subsequently with the Eretrians (vi. 119) and the Milesians themselves (vi. 20), and of the hatred felt for the Ionians by the Phoenician traders, whom they had supplanted in the Levant and threatened in the West (i. 163; iv. 152). For Greek proposals to transplant the Ionians cf. i. 170; ix. 10 f. These Persian traitors in Sardis are a puzzle. Could they be Lydians who still nourished national aspirations? kath=gon: reducebant (i. 60. 5); imperfect, because they failed; cf. \u00a7 2 e)/peiqe and e)/peise. Chios and Miletus were old friends (i. 18. 3), hence the former will not use force but only persuasion in favour of Histiaeus. That merchant vessels from Ionia are meant is shown by ch. 26. 1. Miletus would suffer most from this blockade, as she traded largely with her colonies and factories on the Euxine. Histiaeus in grasping at power in the North-East Aegean showed at least a keen eye for a trade route. The battle of Lade. The gathering of the fleets, and the secrei intrigues of the exiled tyrants (6-10). The attempt of Dionysius of Phocaea to train the Greeks (11, 12). The battle lost through the treachery of the Samians and others (13-17). The four great naval powers of the Persian empire are combined against the Ionians. Phoenicia, Egypt, Cilicia, and Cyprus furnish Xerxes with 750 ships (vii. 89 f.). probou/lous sfe/wn au)tw=n. The genitive is objective; cf. vii. 172. 1 pro/bouloi th=s *(ella/dos.

Pol. 1299 b 31-8, &c., Thuc. viii. 1. *paniw/nion: cf. i. 148 n.; v. 109. 3 n. The resolution shows that the Ionians realized the importance of their sea-power (i. 27; v. 109 n.) as their past history had taught them (i. 17). Lade protected the entrance to the harbour, and played an important part in the siege by Alexander (Arrian, Anab. i. 18 f.). Still an island in the days of Strabo (635), it has now been converted by the alluvial deposit into a hill in the plain of the Maeander. For similar detailed catalogues compare those of Xerxes' army (vii. 61 f.) and fleet (vii. 89 f.), of the Greek fleets at Artemisium (viii. 1 f.) and at Salamis (viii. 43 f.), and of the Greek army at Plataea (ix. 28), as well as the catalogue of ships and men in the Iliad (Bk. II). The cities on the Hellespont had been reduced by Daurises (v. 117), the Aeolic cities in the Troad by Hymaees (v. 122); those in Aeolis proper probably shared the fate of Cyme (v. 123). Only the island power of Lesbos is left to represent the Aeolians. The Dorian cities are here and elsewhere in the Ionic revolt conspicuous by their absence. Of the twelve Ionic cities, Clazomenae was in Persian hands (v. 123), while Lebedus and Colophon, which lie on the route from Clazomenae to Miletus, may also have fallen. The men of Ephesus took little part in the revolt, for though they furnished guides for the march to Sardis (v. 100), they massacred the fugitive Chians (vi. 16). The small number of Phocaean ships (three) shows how much that city was reduced by the great emigration (i. 165-7); Samos, on the other hand, has quite recovered after its devastation twenty years before (iii. 149). The order is roughly geographical, but the Samians are posted on the wing as being the best sailors. The numbers of the contingents agree with the total and may well be authentic; for the 'six hundred' Persian ships cf. 2. ta/ per, 'which shall assuredly (revera, cf. iii. 68. 2) come upon them.' The remark is not part of the message, but a parenthetical assurance that the threats are serious (cf. ch. 32). *ba/ktra: the city Balkh (ix. 113. 1), mentioned as the furthest limit of the Persian Empire (cf. iv. 204). a)gnwmosu/nh| (cf. v. 83. 1). To stigmatize as obstinacy a refusal to listen to proposals of treachery shows a bias against the Ionians and for the Samians, which makes it likely that the story comes from a Samian source (cf. 13). h)goro/wnto. The word in this epic form may be ironically reminiscent of such passages as Il. iv. 1, viii. 230. Elaborate oratory, an Ionic failing (iii. 46), was certainly unseasonable, yet the campaign of Salamis too was conducted by discussion (viii. 49, 56 f.). *)epi\\ curou=, 'balanced on a ke/rws (Thuc.

This manuvre (cf. ch. 15. 2) is again mentioned at Artemisium (viii. 9), but was first used with effect by the Athenians in the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. ii. 83, 89, &c.), its absence in the battle of Sybota proving the inferior skill of the Corinthian and Corcyrean navies (Thuc. i. 49). It consisted in breaking through the enemy's line, and then turning rapidly to ram one of his ships on its defenceless side or stern. It demanded great skill in the coxswain and efficiency in the oarsmen. It was met by forming in a circle with prows outward (cf. viii. 11), a device which proved useless against Athenian daring and skill (Thuc. ii. 83), or by drawing up the ships on the wings in a double line (Xen. Hell. i. 6. 29-31), or by having a second line in reserve (v. 121 n.). If H. is not guilty of an anachronism, the Athenians only perfected a manuvre practised by the Ionians. Sosylus even makes it a Phoenician device brilliantly met by Heraclides (v. 121 n.). The grievance was that Dionysius kept the sailors on board practising manuvres, and the marines under arms all day, in stead of letting them enjoy themselves ashore like an army in tents. e)kplw/santes. For the metaphor, here strikingly appropriate, cf. iii. 155. 3. Anxious to insist on the cogency of the motives which led the Samians to betray the Ionian cause, H. thrusts the bare fact of their treachery between two attempts to excuse it, oi( *sa/mioi resuming the oi( strathgoi\\ tw=n *sami/wn. His primary motive for insisting on the insubordination and effeminacy of the Ionians is to whitewash the Samians. But we can hardly doubt that he was also influenced by the facts and feelings of his own day. The contrast between Lade and Salamis (implicit in H. and explicitly drawn out by Grote, iv. 229) was surely made by men of the Periclean age, when Athenians justified their suzerainty over their Ionic kinsmen by boasting of superior courage and discipline (Thuc. i. 75, 99). Yet the Ionians had long been adventurous sailors, had already once beaten the king's fleet (v. 112), and owed their defeat at Lade to treachery. pentaplh/sion: a gross exaggeration. The full force of Xerxes is 1207 ships (vii. 89), or without the Greek and Carian contingents 830.

The similar confession about Salamis (viii. 87. 1) and the reason here given, mutual recriminations, show how conflicting and untrustworthy were the traditions of the different states. On the other hand, they give us a little more confidence when H. by his silence implies that he is satisfied with the evidence at his command. to\\ koino/n. No doubt the eleven patriotic trierarchs were members of the Samian aristocracy (toi=s te e)/xousi, ch. 22. 1), opposed to the philo-Persian partisans of the tyrant. Hence after Mycale and the liberation of Samos their conduct is commemorated by the Samian government, which remained aristocratic at least till 440 B. C. (Thuc. i. 115). H. must have seen the stele in Samos (Introduction, \u00a7 21, n. 1). patro/qen, 'with the addition of their fathers names.' For this honour cf. iii. 1. 4, viii. 90. 4; Il. x. 68; Thuc. vii. 69. tessera/konta. The number on the Persian ships at Salamis was thirty beside the native troops; on the Athenian there are said to have been only eighteen (Plut. Them. 14); in the Peloponnesian war the number was reduced to ten (vii. 184. 2 n.). The large number of marines here would only be useful for boarding in the old-fashioned style (Thuc. i. 49); their presence makes it all the more likely that the ascription of the die/kplous to the Ionians (\u00a7 2; cf. 12. 1) is an anachronism. *muka/lhn. The Chians, having broken the Persian line, could force their way through the channel past Trogilium, but the crippled ships had to be beached on Mycale and abandoned. For the Thesmophoria cf. ii. 171 n., and for similar worships v. 61, 82, 83 n. oi( *)efe/sioi. This extraordinary ignorance of the fight at Lade may be an excuse put forward when Ephesian abstention from all share in the struggle except this slaughter of the vanquished was accounted treason by patriotic Greeks.

The buccaneer was still respectable (Thuc. i. 5). To prey on the enemies of his country would no more seem wrong to Dionysius than to our own Elizabethan seamen (cf. i. 163. 2n.).

The synchronism between the Ionic revolt and the Argive war is valuable (ch. 77 n.). peri\\ swthri/hs. Bury (Klio ii. 14 f.) shows that the only occasion on which this epicene oracle is probable is during the visit of Aristagoras to Greece. The Argives, threatened by a Spartan attack (ch. 77), consulted the oracle peri\\ swthri/hs th=s po/lios th=s sfete/rhs, yet the answer given concerns Miletus as much as Argos, though Miletus had not sent to inquire of Delphi. The answer of the oracle is only explicable on the assumption that the Milesians had asked Argos for help, and Argos had agreed to consult Delphi. We may be sure that Aristagoras sought aid at other places besides Sparta and Athens. Eretria sent five ships (v. 99), doubtless at his request. What more natural than that, rebuffed at Sparta, he should turn to Sparta's rival? But Argos may well have regarded the risk as too great, and not have gone beyond a promise to inquire of the oracle whether it would be safe for their city to send help to Ionia. Cf., however, the doubts as to the oracle raised by Wells, J.H.S. xxv. 194-5. Delphi now, as later (vii. 140 f.), may have thought the Great King invincible, as did Aristagoras (v. 124) and the Samians (vi. 13), and have foreshadowed, if it did not originate, the historian's opinion that the authors of the revolt merely brought evil on their country (v. 28, 97 n.). Probably, too, the proposed confiscation of the treasures at Branchidae (v. 36), which the priests at Branchidae and Delphi must have known was only too likely to be carried out under the hard pressure of war, prejudiced Delphi against Miletus. *perse/wn komhte/wn, 'as may be seen in the baquxaith/eis *mh=dos, Aesch. ap.

The word is borrowed from the oracle. Elsewhere (i. 46. 2, 157 f.) H. calls it Branchidae. H. clearly ascribes the ruin of this and other Greek temples in Asia (25, 32) to Darius. Hence, unless we suppose the work was done twice over, Strabo (634) can hardly be right in attributing the sack of Branchidae and the others, except that of Ephesus, to Xerxes in 479 B. C. Strabo's account seems to depend on the story that the Branchidae themselves betrayed the temple and its treasures, a crime for which their descendants in Sogdiana were said to have been punished by Alexander (Strabo 518; Plut. Mor. 557 B; Q. Curtius, story may come from Callisthenes (Strabo 814), but is discredited by the silence of Arrian, though accepted by Grote, xii. 25. polla/kis: explicitly twice, i. 92. 2; v. 36. 3; but cf. also i. 46. 2, 157 f.; ii. 159. 3. For such transplantations cf. iv. 204 n.; vi. 3 n. The expatriation of the Milesians can hardly have been complete, since Milesians destroy the fugitive Persians after Mycale (ix. 99, 104).

Originally dependent colonies of Sybaris, which, after the destruction of that city in 510 B. C. (cf. v. 44), probably received the exiles. Both lay on the west coast of Italy, probably not far apart. Laus was on the river still called Lao, the boundary of Lucania (Strabo 253), four hundred stades from Velia. with Miletus and Etruria were doubtless commercial. Sybaris was the d\u00e9p\u00f4t to which the wares of Asia and Egypt were brought by Milesian ships (cf. v. 99 n.). Thence they were carried overland to Laus, and there reshipped for Etruria. The control of this land-route was all the more important, as foes of Miletus, Chalcis, and her allies (v. 99 n.) commanded the Straits of Messina. The friendship of the Etruscans with Sybaris is in marked contrast with their hostility to other Greeks in the Tyrrhene seas (cf. i. 166). Further proof of the importance of this overland route may be found in the alliance coins (Pais, Ancient Italy, p. 83) of Siris and Pyxus (before 510 B. C.), and later of New Sybaris and Posidonia (circ. 450), Croton and Temesa, &c. (Hill, G. and R. C., pp. 104, 115), and in the frequent occurrence of Greek vases in Campanian and Etruscan tombs (Lenormant, La Grande Gr\u00e8ce, i. 263 f.). The colony of Thurii may have been an attempt to revive this old trade, Athens here, as elsewhere, figuring as the heir of Miletus (v. 97. 2 n.). Themistocles would seem to have originated the idea of a colony in that district (viii. 62; Plut. Them. 32), afterwards imperfectly realized by Pericles. ou)de\\n o(moi/ws. For asyndeton in such appended notes, which may be later additions by the author, cf. i. 20; vii. 54. 3, 111. 2, &c. 'In this they (the Sybarites) were quite unlike the Athenians.' Phrynichus was an elder contemporary of Aeschylus. Of his drama on the fall of Miletus no fragment has survived. It was probably the first attempt to treat in tragedy an event of the day, an attempt repeated by Phrynichus in his Phoenissae (476 B. C.), which, like the Persae of Aeschylus, represented the defeat of Xerxes. His earlier drama may have contained reproaches of Athens for the desertion of Miletus (oi)kh/ia kaka/), and have been intended to awaken the national spirit and inspire resistance to Persia, perhaps by sea, since Themistocles, choragus for Phrynichus in 476 B. C. (Plut. Them. 5), is said to have begun the building of Piraeus as archon in 493 B. C. (vii. 143 n.). For his manifesto the author was punished, probably by those responsible for the withdrawal from Ionia (v. 103 n.; cf. Meyer, iii, \u00a7 182-3).

Hence the importance of *kalh\\ *)akth/ which faced pro\\s *turshni/hn. Cf. the iii. 88; Diod. v. 9; Paus. x. 11. 4, with Frazer). Originally perhaps a military brotherhood like the knights of St. John at Rhodes, it became a nest of pirates (Liv. v. 28). The Samians as friends of Chalcis (v. 99 n.) were on good terms with her colonists in the West. Zancle was a joint colony from Euboic Chalcis and Campanian Cumae (Thuc. vi. 4), but seems at this time to have been a dependency of Dorian Gela. *milhsi/wn oi( e)kpefeugo/tes: i. e. from Lade (ch. the Locrians of the mother-country, the Opuntii (vii. 203) and the Ozolae (viii. 32), both of whom claimed to be its founders. *)anaci/lews: tyrant B. C. 494-476 (Diod. xi. 48). For his friendship with the barbarian cf. vii. 164, 165. Rhegium, like its neighbour across the strait, Zancle, was a Chalcidic colony. The close connexion of the two, and of the Samians with Anaxilaus, is attested by the adoption of similar types on the coins, the calf's head being a Samian type, and the lion's head perhaps taken from the lion's scalp of Samos (Hill, H. G. C. 29 f., and in more detail Dodd, J. H. S. xxviii. 56-76). Anaxilaus was probably bent on establishing his own supremacy over Zancle, an object he in the end attained (vii. 164 n.). Hippocrates ruled 498-491 B. C.; cf. vii. 154, 155. He and Anaxilaus are tyrants, while Scythes (\u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4) is basileu/s and mou/narxos, probably because H. drew from a source favourable to Scythes. Apparently Hippocrates is not an equal ally but his overlord (vii. 154; Freeman, S. ii. 113). *)/inuka: an unimportant place, probably in the territory of Acragas (vii. 170), famed for its wine. Himera was a settlement of Zanclaeans (Thuc. vi. 5. 1). dikaio/taton. This righteousness is in marked contrast with the conduct of Democedes (iii. 135). It was hereditary in the family, if Cadmus, who resigned the tyranny of Cos (vii. 164), is the son of the same Scythes, as is held by Stein, Macan, and Busolt, though denied by Holm, Freeman, and E. Meyer. Cadmus' resignation of that tyranny and recapture of Zancle from the Samians are more natural if his father was the exiled lord of Zancle. For a reconstruction of the story cf. vii. 164 n. The full account in Pausanias (iv. 25) is misdated after the second Messenian war, and so confused as to be worthless. a)ponhti/. H., a true Greek, is more impressed by the cleverness of the Samians than by their baseness. But he emphasizes the one good point in their conduct, their mercy to the captive aristocrats (ch. 23).

Indeed, the flourishing condition of these regions soon after shows that these severities have been exaggerated. M. Polo, i. ch. 18 (Yule, ii. 98), speaks of the Caraonas (apparently a Tartar tribe in Persia) riding abreast so as to catch every living thing outside the fortified towns and villages.

The thrice-repeated conquest is true of the Ionians on the mainland, but the islanders had not been conquered by Croesus (i. 27), nor yet probably by Cyrus, who had no fleet (i. 143), though the Ionian islands submitted (i. 169).

Loyalty to Persia (cf. ix. 115), rather than its geographical position, explains its escape. The Dolonci occur elsewhere only in Steph. Byz., and in the catalogues of Pliny (H.

The Apsinthii (ix. 119), evidently just north of the Chersonese (ch. 37), are said to have extended as far as the Hebrus (iv. 90), where the district round the city Aenus had once been called Apsinthis (Steph. Byz.; Strabo 331, fr. 58). Myres (J. xxvii. 173) holds that the Apsinthii and Caeni overran the region occupied by Pelasgians in the Homeric catalogue. i(rh/n. Wayfarers on the road were under the god's protection.

Pausanias (i. 35. 2) makes Philaeus the son of Eurysaces, the only son of Ajax recognized by Sophocles, but Plutarch (Solon 10), with Herodotus, Hellanicus, and Pherecydes, regards him as the son of Ajax. Further, he makes the brothers, Philaeus and Eurysaces, surrender Salamis to Athens, Philaeus settling in Brauron, where the deme Philaidae lay. ai)xma/s: the wearing of arms had passed out of use (Thuc. i. 6). The Dolonci may have seen in the encouragement of a Greek colony their only hope of resisting the Apsinthii; but probably the initiative came from Athens. Pisistratus was fully alive to the importance of Thrace and the Hellespont (i. 64; v. 94, 95; Appendix XVI, \u00a7 8). Miltiades in the Chersonese might prove a useful vassal of the ruler of Athens, in Attica he would have been discontented, and perhaps disloyal. The removal of dangerous citizens was part of the policy of despots.

The measurements given are accurate, though Dercyllidas measured the breadth as 37 stades (Xen. l. c.); Strabo (p. 331, fr. 52, 54) follows Scylax (68) in giving rough approximations, 40 and 400 stades. *lamyakhnoi=si.

Miltiades and Cimon were sons of the same mother by different fathers (cf. v. 25. 1).

Olorus may have been a prince of the Dolonci, or the name of his tribe may have fallen out of the text after *qrhi/kwn. Olorus, father of Thucydides, seems to have been a son of Hegesipyle, probably by a second marriage. Thucydides' monument was among the tombs of the family of Cimon (Plut. Cim. 4 and Marcellinus, quoting Polemo on the Acropolis). A confused chapter, ambiguous in expression and difficult in substance. The central statement that Miltiades fled before a Scythian raid and was restored by the Dolonci is clear enough. But of the obscure sentences before and after two interpretations are given. I. Rawlinson takes newsti\\ e)lhlu/qee of the first coming of Miltiades to the Chersonese, the tw=n katexo/ntwn prhgma/twn of the advance of the Phoenician fleet, and the a)/lla xalepw/tera of the Scythian raid. But to this the following objections seem fatal: (1) It is absurd to apply newsti/ to a period of at least fifteen years, but the Scythic raid is clearly dated to 495 B. C., while Miltiades' accession was before 510, probably before 515 B. C. (2) The argument is weak. Rawlinson's explanation implies that Miltiades' temporary expulsion by the Scyths was worse than his permanent expulsion by the Persians, which is absurd. (3) The clear intention of the author in the last sentence of the chapter is to explain what precedes. Hence tri/tw| e)/tei+ (\u00a7 1) must be identical with tri/tw| e)/tei+ pro/teron (\u00a7 2). II. Therefore with Stein we must understand e)lhlu/qee and e)lqo/nta (\u00a7 1) of Miltiades' return to the Chersonese (kath/gagon, \u00a7 2), H. awkwardly inserting the notice of his flight before the Scyths after mentioning his return. H. means that the fortunes of Miltiades went from bad to worse, his final expulsion by the Phoenicians being a yet greater misfortune than his temporary flight before the Scyths. Thus tri/tw| e)/tei+ tou/twn must mean the third year before this (cf. \u00a7 2; Cobet, Abicht), or, if this translation be thought impossible, pro/ must be inserted before tou/twn (Stein). Wells (Stud. Herod. pp. 118-20) gives another interpretation of this obscure passage (ch. 40). *sku/qai oi( noma/des: cf. iv. 11. 1. 19. e)reqisqe/ntes u(po\\ *darei/ou. The idea of a war of vengeance on the part of the Scyths seems a mere fiction (ch. 84), since the expedition of Darius was at least fifteen, and probably twenty years before. Perhaps the Scyths took advantage of the temporary weakening of the Persian Empire by the Ionic revolt; more probably these nomads were some Thracian or Moesian tribe and not Scyths. Grote's suggestion (iv. 201) that it was the Persians and not the Scyths who expelled Miltiades is not what H. says, and rests on Miltiades' supposed treachery to Darius at the bridge over the Danube (iv. 137). But this patriotic scheme is very doubtful; perhaps it was invented when the tyrant of Chersonese had reached Athens (ch. 104), and was anxious to prove himself a true friend of Hellenic liberties (Thirlwall, ii, App. II; Macan, App. iii, \u00a7 14; 413). to/te: i. e. 493 B. C. Miltiades fled at the first approach of the Phoenicians, as is shown by the mention of Tenedos (cf. ch. 31) and by his starting from Cardia. dwsi/dikoi. The meaning is clearly that all warfare between cities, as well as piracy and brigandage, was abolished, and di/kai a)po\\ sumbolw=n established throughout Ionia. We cannot say how far such treaties already existed, but the position of Histiaeus shows that hitherto the local authorities in Ionia had been allowed much independence. The organizing genius of Darius took advantage of the revolt and its suppression to put an end to this. Thus the Ionians were compelled by their Persian masters to accept a unity which they had refused to impose on themselves at the suggestion of Thales (i. 170). In the same way private wars were checked by the Athenian a)rxh/ (Thuc. i. 115). Evidence of long-continued enmity may be found in the dispute between Samos and Priene recorded in an Inscription in the Ashmolean Museum (Hicks1, 152). fo/rous: cf. iii. 89, 90. The statement as to the tribute is defective and difficult. Doubtless the arrangement of Artaphrenes applied to other revolted tributaries as well as to Ionians, but H. mentions only the most important, just as the whole rebellion is usually called the Ionic revolt. Again, the words e)/ti kai\\ e)s e)me/ cannot bear the natural meaning that tribute was still paid to Persia in accordance with this assessment at the time when H. wrote his history, but must be explained in one of the following ways: (1) Grote (v. 194-5) thinks that the Persian king still maintained his claim to the old tribute, though it was not really paid. The satrap was still responsible to the king for the money, though unable to exact it. As soon as the Athenian power seemed broken in 412, the great king pressed Tissaphernes for payment (Thuc. viii. 5). The claim had been for years in abeyance but never withdrawn. We may compare the grants of Myus and Lampsacus to Themistocles (Thuc. i. 138), and of Myrrhina and Gryneium to Gongylus the Eretrian (Xen. Hell. iii. 1. 6). The latter were held by Gongylus' descendants in 399 B. C., but all four cities were included in the Athenian empire in its palmy days. (2) Some suggest that the unlucky states on the Asiatic seaboard paid tribute both to Athens and to the Great King. Some such arrangement seems certainly to have prevailed on the coast of Thrace under the Odrysian kings (Thuc. ii. 97), but the cases are not really parallel. (3) Another suggestion is that the assessment of Artaphrenes was the basis of the Athenian fo/ros, which was certainly paid by these cities before 450 B. C., and probably from 465. If, however, H. meant that the Athenian taktai/ used the old valuation, he has failed to express himself clearly, and the frequent alterations of the Phoros on the existing quota lists seem inconsistent with this explanation. (4) The simplest explanation is that H. uses e)s e)me/ loosely, meaning merely till the Persian power was overthrown, i. e. between 479 and circ. 465 B. C. Some of the states were still paying tribute when H. was a boy; in all he could (and doubtless did) talk with those to whom the claims of the Persian tax-collector were familiar. So a septuagenarian Bengalee might well write to-day: 'The rule of John Company lasted down to my time,' although it really ended in 1858. It should further be noticed that Diodorus (x. 25. 2) ascribes not only this regulation of taxes, but also the restoration of constitutional government in Ionia (cf. ch. 43 n.) to Artaphrenes, acting on the suggestion of Hecataeus. Was H. unwilling to allow credit to his great predecessor for the conciliatory and successful reorganization of Ionia? Mardonius establishes democracies in Ionia. He invades Europe subjugating Thasos and Macedon, but loses his fleet off Mount Athos and retires. tw=| e)/ari: of 492 B. C. H. here begins his year, like Thucydides, with spring. H. is so anxious to put forward his supposed proof that he makes e)re/w the main verb instead of leaving it in a dependent clause. Cf. i. 27. 2; ii. 103. 2; vi. 14. 1, &c. For the speech of Otanes cf. iii. 80, and for the 'Seven' iii. 84. It has been held that this is a reply to criticisms passed on the story of the debate (iii. 80 f.), but the incredulity of the critics is already noticed there, and may perhaps apply rather to the tradition handed down to H. than to the form given it in his work. The proof here alleged is of the weakest. Otanes, not Gobryas, was the advocate of democracy, and there was all the difference between establishing democracy in Persia and permitting it in Ionia. Further H. seems to have exaggerated and misrepresented the action of Mardonius. In many Greek and Carian cities (vii. 98, 195) dynasts held their own. So in Chios Strattis (iv. 138; viii. 132), in Samos Aeaces (ch. 25), in Cos Cadmus (vii. 164), in Halicarnassus Artemisia (vii. 99). In Lampsacus, too, the sons of Aeantides, son of Hippoclus (iv. 138) succeeded to the throne (Thuc. vi. 59). Here again, as in ch. 42, it is true that H. only speaks of Ionians, but such a measure would naturally extend to all the revolted states which had expelled their tyrants. This establishment of democracies then may mean little more than the restoration of local liberties ascribed by Diodorus to Artaphrenes (ch. 42 n.). In any case it would seem to have been partial, and dictated rather by distrust of the tyranny which had proved a dangerous instrument of government, than by any preference for democracy. *makedo/nas (cf. v. 17 f.). H. (vii. 108) speaks as if Megabazus had conquered Macedon before Mardonius, but probably the Persian troops did not actually cross the Strymon till 492 B. C. e)nto\\s *makedo/nwn: from a Persian point of view, i. e. east of Macedon (cf. i. 6. 1). me/xri *)aka/nqou: i. e. where Xerxes later cut his canal (vii. 22).

These Thracian neighbours of Macedon may be placed between the Strymon and Mount Athos. In the list of tribes given in vii. 185 they come between the men of Chalcidice and the Pieres. The two passages agree if in vii. 185 the Pieres are the branch of the tribe who lived east of the Strymon (vii. 112). Scymnus Chius (434) and Strabo (326) locate the Brygi far to the west on the borders of Epirus and Illyria. Probably they are connected with the *bri/ges (vii. 73), the European ancestors of the Phrygians. ai)sxrw=s a)gwnisa/menos. Macan suggests that with the exception of the loss to the fleet the expedition was a brilliant success, since H. elsewhere (vii. 9. n. 2) allows Mardonius to claim credit for his operations, and acknowledges his success in reconquering Thrace and Macedon (vii. 108). But if the object of the campaign was the conquest of Hellas in general and of Athens and Eretria in particular, his task was unfulfilled. And in spite of modern scepticism there is good reason to suppose that the idea of a punitive expedition and wide schemes of conquest were entertamed at the Persian court. The conquest of European Hellas may well have seemed the only means of securing the dominion of Persia over the Greeks of Asia. The expedition of Datis shows that Athens and Eretria were to be punished, and also that the advance by land was considered to have failed. Probably its difficulties had not been foreseen. When this plan of campaign was again adopted, great preparations were made to meet them (vii. 21 f.). No doubt Greek writers exaggerate the failure of Mardonius, but his losses were real, and his recall is best explained by Darius' adoption of a different plan of operations. 491 B. C.

Macan suggests that this second submission of Thasos is a dittograph, i. e. that H. gives two accounts drawn from different sources of one surrender. It is doubtless true that the accounts are quite independent, the second being perhaps learned by H. in Thasos. But the prosperity of the Thasians might well cause their jealous neighbours falsely to accuse them of intending to take advantage of the recent Persian losses. *)/abdhra: colonized from Clazomenae and recolonized from Teos (i. 168 n.). It may, however, have been earlier a Phoenician station, since the name is Phoenician, and the early coins are of the Phoenician standard (Head, H. N. 253).

From these mines the state drew its ordinary revenue, royalties, &c., while the citizens were free from land-tax and apparently all direct taxes (\u00a7 3). Thasos is said to have spent four hundred talents in entertaining Xerxes (vii. 118); its tribute to Athens at its highest was only thirty talents, which is, however, as much as was paid by any state. This passage proves a visit to Thasos and to its mines over against Samothrace. Yet though the site of Koenyra is marked by the modern Kenira, Tozer (I. of Aeg. 307) could neither find nor hear of any traces of mining in that district. *foi/nikes. This settlement from Tyre is dated by H. (ii. 44) five generations before the birth of Heracles, on the faith of mythical genealogies; cf. iv. 147, v. 59.

The phrase may apply to the Cyclades, except Naxos and Delos (cf. 96, 97), and to Lemnos, Imbros, and Samothrace. The account here given plainly implies that Sparta and Athens refused to submit, but the omission of the story told later (vii. 133 f.) of the treatment of the Persian heralds is remarkable. Cf. vii. 137 n. This appeal to Sparta against Aegina (491 B. C.) implies recognition by Athens of Spartan hegemony (for which cf. i. 69 n.). Either Miltiades (cf. the sending of Philippides before Marathon, ch. 105) or Themistocles (cf. the tale of Polycritus at Salamis, viii. 92) may well have seen how menacing was the attitude of Aegina, and how necessary to Athens the help of Sparta. Cleomenes is given his full style and title, probably to add emphasis; ch. 36. 1. *krio/s: cf. ch. 73. 2; the were irresistible; cf. \u00a7 3, and Cicero, Verrines, II. iv. 43, &c. But the jest of Cleomenes is bitter, like those in Shakespeare attributed to Gaunt (Rich. II, Act ii, Sc. 1). The retreat of Cleomenes from Aegina without hostages and his return with the other king to take them, implies that he admitted the validity of the plea (ch. 73). Yet the presence of both kings might seem to contravene the law made some fifteen years before (v. 75 n.). On the powers of the Spartan kings in foreign affairs cf. App. XVII, \u00a7 2. The story of the dual kingship at Sparta. Privileges of the kings with notes on non-Hellenic customs (ch. 59, 60). This digression (the main story is not resumed till ch. 61) is the most important contribution in H. to Greek constitutional history. It illustrates admirably how much and how little the Greeks knew of their origins, and also the religious and military character of early kingship. The legend of the twins is a clumsy fiction intended to account for the dual kingship. The most probable origin of this anomaly is the fusion of two distinct communities whose chiefs shared the throne. That the two royal houses were of different origin seems proved by the fact that their homes and tombs were to be found in different quarters of Sparta, those of the Agiads close to the Acropolis (Paus. iii. 14. 2), those of the Eurypontids on the heights of New Sparta (Paus. iii. 12. 8). The two quarters may have been originally (cf. the case of Rome) two distinct communities. It is perhaps most likely that both communities and both kings were Dorian invaders (Duncker, G. i. 351 f.), and that the claims of the kings to Achaean descent (cf. v. 72; i. 67; vii. 159) were a fiction intended to justify the Dorian conquest. Wachsmuth, however (Jahrbuch f. Philologie, 1868, p. 1 f.), sees in the superior dignity of the elder Agiad line, and in the claim of Cleomenes to be an Achaean (v. 72), indications that the old Achaean royal house survived side by side with that of the invading Dorians. In any case, the rival theory that the dual kingship was instituted to weaken the royal power (cf. the Consulship at Rome) confuses effect and cause, and fails to explain such facts as the separate burying-places. For other instances of double kingship in Greece and elsewhere (e.g. Siam), and for further discussion cf. Busolt, i. 546. 4; Frazer, Paus. iii. 312. It is interesting to note H.'s claim to speak from complete knowledge of Greek poets; cf. ch. 53. 1, and Introduction, \u00a7 18. The poets' story was that Aristodemus died just before the Dorian invasion (Paus. iii. 1. 6; Apollodorus ii. 8. 2). H. follows local Spartan tradition, as does Xenophon (Ages. viii. 7). *)argei/hn.

Indeed, the younger child seems to have been brought up as a private individual (\u00a7 7). The story is inconsistent as well as unhistorical. e)n tw=| dhmosi/w|, 'in some state building' (cf. e)n tw=| koinw=| (Abbott) rather than (Stein) 'at the public charge' under official guardianship (cf. ch. 57. 2, 92. 2).

H. (cf. ii. 91. 5) accepts the well-known Danaid legend, from the Epic Danais, and the Supplices of Aeschylus. This 'Persian' story varies from the ordinary Hellenic (vii. 61. 150) in the important points, that Perseus does not go from Argos to Cepheus, king of the Cephenes (i. e. the Assyrians, vii. 61. 2), to marry his daughter Andromeda, and so become the father of Perses, the eponym of the Persians, but is himself of Assyrian descent, and the first of his family to become a Greek. Yet the envoys of Xerxes (vii. 150) are represented as accepting the ordinary Greek view. o(/ ti de/, 'wherefore and for what services they, though Egyptians, attained.' The points omitted are the adoption of the Heracleid Hyllus by the Dorian king Aegimius, which gave the Dorians a claim to the heritage of the Heracleids, the Peloponnese, and the exploits of the Heracleids who led the Dorian invasion (ix. 26 f.). a)/lloisi. Possibly the writer of the Epic 'Aegimius', more probably the Logographers, e. g. Charon of Lampsacus; cf. Introd. \u00a7 19. This refusal to repeat a story which had already received literary treatment cannot be generalized into a maxim for H.'s whole work (Macan, p. lxxxiii n.). The honours given the Spartan kings are divided into three classes: (1) in war, ch. 56; (2) in peace, ch. 57; (3) after death, ch. 58. H. (cf. 58. 1) perhaps regards them as resting on some such contract between king and people as the monthly oath in Xen. Rep. Lac. xv. 7. The eponymous hero Lacedaemon is (in Paus. iii. 1. 2, 20. 2), son of Zeus and Taygete, and husband of Sparta. His shrine was at Alesiae between Therapne and is so definitely local. *zeu\\s *lakedai/mwn would seem to be a primitive local deity, possibly chthonian, afterwards degraded into a 'hero'. *zeu\\s *ou)ra/nios is the lord of the heavens. The latter cult (ta\\ me/gala *ou)ra/nia) continued under the Roman empire (C. I G. 1241, 1420). The Spartan kings as Heracleids were descendants of Zeus, and his natural representatives, as were the Heracleid kings of Macedon of the Bottiaean Zeus, and the Aeacid princes in Epirus of the Dodonaean (Preller, i. 149). Xenophon (Rep. Lac. xiii and xv) tells us the king offered all public sacrifices, and in particular, to Zeus Agetor on setting forth to war, and to Zeus and Athena on crossing the frontier. po/lemon e)kfe/rein. Perhaps in prehistoric times the kings could actually declare war, but, even if this be so, the necessity of the people's consent was early established (cf. App. XVII, \u00a7 2). Traces of the royal control of foreign affairs may be found even in the fifth century (cf. v. 74, 75; vi. 73), but later this power was vested in the Ephors (Xen. Hell. iii. 1. 1; v. 2. 9, 11); Xenophon describes this state of things when he limits the power of the kings to the conduct of the campaign. (Rep. Lac. ch. he had crossed the frontier after favourable auspices (diabath/ria) did the king exercise a really sovran power (Thuc. v. 60, 66; viii. 5, and in general App. XVII, \u00a7 2). Even in the field insubordination was not unknown (ix. 55; Thuc. v. 72). e)n tw=| a)/gei+. Probably such an execration entailed exile (cf. Thuc. v. 72). Such curses often were extended to the whole house (cf. Hicks, 23; C. I. G. 2691; Aeschin. c. Ctes. \u00a7 The full number of i(ppei=s was three hundred; cf. i. 67. 5 n., vii. 205. 2, viii. 124. 3; Thuc. v. 72. This hundred might be the contingent of one of the three Dorian tribes. proba/toisi: for offerings, victims being required for the diabath/ria and for sacrifices before battle. The king's perquisites remind us of Homeric customs (cf. Il. vii. 321; Od. iv. 66), and may be due to the religious origin of the office. For similar priestly claims cf. 1 Sam. ii. 13 f. qusi/h dhmotelh/s: offered by the kings; cf. 56 n.; Xen. Rep. Lac. xv. 2. a)/rxesqai: sc.tou\\s ne/montas, xv. 4). Xerxes (vii. 103. 1) distinctly alludes to this custom. spondarxi/as: again a Homeric custom (Il. xii. 310 f.). neomhni/as. The first day of the month ('new moon') was everywhere sacred, and a day of offering to the gods (i(era\\ e)pimh/nia, e)/mmhna: cf. viii. 41. 2); the seventh was the birthday of Apollo and specially dedicated to him (Hesiod, *)/erga 770). For the accusative cf. i. 181. 5, 186. 3; vii. 50. 4, 203. 1. me/dimnon. The old view that the Laconian or Aeginetan medimnus was half as much again as the Attic (Athenaeus, 141 C) is disproved by Ath. Pol. ch. 10 (Sandys, note; cf. G. F. Hill, Num. Chron. 1897, p. 284 f.). Probably the Pheidonian measures are equivalent to the Babylonian, and stood to the Solonian in the ratio of 12 : 13. Since the Attic medimnus contains nearly twelve gallons, the Pheidonian would be nearly eleven gallons. teta/rth cannot be the Attic te/tarton, which, being the quarter of the sextarius (ce/sth), belongs to Roman times and is far too small, being about a quarter of a pint. Since the monthly contribution of each Spartan to the Syssitia was a medimnus of meal and eight xo/es of wine (Plut. Lyc. 12), this Laconian teta/rth may be one of eight xo/es, or about five and a half gallons; if, however, the proportion given in \u00a7 3 of one cotyle to two choenices be taken, it would be but two xo/es. proedri/as: concrete; cf. iv. 88. 1. For the abstract sense cf. i. 54. 2; ix. 73. 3. This custom is illustrated by the anecdote in ch. 67. procei/nous. Proxeni are usually citizens of a foreign city who undertook to watch over the interests of the community which they represented, e. g. Callias was Proxenus of Sparta at Athens (cf. viii. 136. 1; Xen. Hell. vi. 3. 4). The Proxenia in these cases seems to have been almost hereditary in character (Thuc. v. 43; vi. 89). It does not appear probable that the kings had the appointment either of these Spartan Proxeni abroad or of the representatives of foreign states in Sparta. Hence P. Monceaux has suggested that these proxeni nominated by the kings were special ones appointed to do the honours of the state to foreigners who had no ordinary representative at Sparta; for some late analogies cf. Smith, Antiquities, i. 978. *pu/qioi. The connexion of Sparta with Delphi was peculiarly close. Cic. de Divin. i. 95 '(Lacedaemonii) Dodona petebant'. Cf. v. 63. 90; vii. 220. Other states employed qewroi/. siteo/menoi. Apparently they messed with the king at the Phiditia. Xen. Rep. Lac. allowed two Attic choenices of meal and two cotylae of wine; their servants were given half this amount (Thuc. iv. 16). ta\\s manthi/as: so Cleomenes carried off a collection from Athens (v. 90). mou/nous: i. e. without the Ephors and Gerousia. patrou/xou. An only daughter was styled e)pi/klhros (or in Doric e)pipamati/s or pamw=xos), which means not that she is the heiress, but that she passes with the inheritance. Aristotle (Pol. ii. 6. 11, 1270 a 26 f.) distinctly tells us that if a father died intestate leaving only a daughter, the heir, as guardian of the orphan daughter, chose her a husband, and that even the father had but recently acquired the right to dispose of his daughter's hand as he pleased. In the days of H. the kings dealt with the question, as did the Archon Eponymus at Athens. In so doing they clearly acted as judges merely determining to whom the e)pi/klhros belonged by law. All this is explained by the primitive constitution of the GraecoRoman family. The inheritance, along with the household cults, and patria potestas, always passed to males. If, then, there were no sons but only a daughter, the ancient principle debarred her from heirship, but by custom she passed with the inheritance to the nearest male relative, whom she married (so Gorgo Leonidas, vii. 205; cf. also vi. 71; Plut. Agis 11). Apparently a father, if he gave an only daughter in marriage, must give her to the nearest relative, or to an adopted son. But adoption (\u00a7 5) itself took place before the kings, and must have been subject to legal rules. If the father died without betrothing his daughter, the nearest male relative could claim both the inheritance and the hand of the daughter. If there were several claimants the kings decided between them. The same principles held good in Crete (cf. the Gortyna Code) and at Athens. Cf. Fustel de Coulanges, Nouvelles Recherches, pp. 97 f. o(dw=n dhmosie/wn. According to Stein and Gilbert, this refers only to the delimitation of roads and private estates, but the kings as leaders in war may have been charged with the care of roads. pari/zein. The words imply that the kings were not ex-officio presidents. Doubtless the Ephors both convened (Xen. Hell. iii. 3. 8) and presided over the Gerousia. Cf. App. XVII, \u00a7 2. du/o yh/fous tiqeme/nous. There can be little doubt Thucydides refers to this passage (i. 20. 3) when he gives as an instance of popular errors the belief that each of the Spartan kings had two votes, not one only, since he corrects in the same sentence another supposed error in H. (ix. though the expression is obscure, probably means not that each king had two votes, but that two votes were given for the two absent kings, and that the vote of the relative who acted as proxy for both was the third. He, however, overlooks the fact that the same person could not be the nearest relative of both kings, since the two houses were only related by a fictitious genealogy and never intermarried. Really there must have been two proxies, one for each king. H. Richards (Cl. R. xix. 343) would omit tri/thn de\\ th\\n e(wutw=n as a late insertion, and so get clearly the sense that the nearest relative of each king gave two votes, his own and that of the king his kinsman. le/bhtas. Beating a bronze cauldron would keep off evil spirits, the original meaning of the 'passing bell'. Cf. A. B. Cook, J. H. S. xxii. 14 f. katamiai/nesqai. Such extravagant signs of mourning (miasmoi/) as tearing the hair, rending the garments, and throwing dust on the head and clothing, were at Athens restricted by Solon (Plut. ch. 12; cf. Thuc. ii. 45), and at Sparta forbidden by Lycurgus for private persons (Plut. Lyc. 27, Mor. 238 D). They are a survival from barbarism (cf. viii. 99; ix. 24) or from heroic times (cf. Il. xviii. 23 f.). So Xen. Rep. 3. 1. *lakedai/monos = Laconia (cf. vii. 234. 2), including Messenia (Paus. iv. 14. 4). a)riqmw=|, 'in fixed number.' Cf. Thuc. ii. 72. ei)/dwlon. This took the place of the body if it could not be brought home, but the only certain case before the time of H. is that of Leonidas (vii. 238; cf. Plut. Agis 21). Later Agesipolis (Xen. Heli. v. 3. 19) and Agesilaus (Plut. ch. 40) died on foreign service, but their bodies were embalmed in honey or wax and brought home. a)gorh/: traffic (cf. i. 153. 2) as well as public business. a)rxairesi/h: meeting for election. These chapters contain additional notes subsequently inserted by the author; perhaps they are meant to bear on the alleged Persian or Egyptian descent of the Spartan kings (cf. 53, 54). kh/rukes: the most famous are the Talthybiadae, sprung from the herald of the Atridae (vii. 134). au)lhtai/: important, as the Spartan army marched to battle to the sound of the flute (Thuc. v. 70). ma/geiroi: clearly those who prepared the Phiditia. They had their heroes, *ma/ttwn (kneader) and *kera/wn (mixer), whose statues stood on the Hyacinthine way (Athen. 39 E). Apparently they accompanied the army on campaigns (ix. 82). No general caste-system should be inferred. Nowhere in the ancient world, not even in Egypt (ii. 164 f.), was there so fully established a caste-system as now exists in India, where status is fixed and free competition eliminated.

Therapne stood on some precipitous heights nearly two miles south-east of Sparta on the opposite side of the Eurotas. The view that it was the site of Homeric (Achaean) Sparta, suggested by its commanding position, is confirmed by the discovery there of Mycenaean pottery and by the worship of Helen and Menelaus (Isoc. x. 63). This sanctuary of Helen is probably identical with the temple of Menelaus, where Menelaus and Helen were buried (Paus. iii. 19. 9). Its ruins, and near them some Mycenaean remains, have been discovered on the top of the hill called Menelaium (Polyb. v. 18. 21; Liv. xxxiv. 28). Castor and Pollux, Helen's brothers, were supposed to lie buried in Therapne on alternate days (Pind. Nem. x. 55; Pyth. xi. 62; cf. Frazer on Paus. iii. 19. 9). The Phoebaeum was below Therapne in the plain on the western bank of the Eurotas (Paus. iii. 14. 9). *(ele/nhs. The view that Helen was a goddess of beauty, and the identification of her with cei/nh *)afrodi/th (ii. 112), seem to be H.'s own conjectures, and erroneous. The foreign Aphrodite must be Astarte, while Helen was a native heroine more akin to Artemis (Wide, Lakonische Kulte, 340 f.), perhaps originally a tree nymph. The Rhodians worshipped Helen of the tree (Paus. iii. 19. 9, with Frazer), and the Spartans Helen's plane-tree (Theocr. xviii. 43). The whole story reads like the miracle of a mediaeval saint, and illustrates a side of Greek life which hardly appears in our literary sources. Ordinary Greek feeling seems to have been less shocked by a technical observance and a virtual breach of contract (cf. iv. 154. 201; Thuc. iii. 34) than by a refusal to be bound by an oath whose real purport had not been understood. Euripides earned much opprobrium by making Hippolytus say in such a case (612) h( glw=ss' o)mw/mox), h( de\\ frh\\n a)nw/motos, yet all moral philosophers would now agree with Cicero (De Off. iii. 29. 107) that such an oath was not binding.

To the grounds given (v. 75; vi. 50 f.) we may perhaps add the conduct of Demaratus in and after the Argive war; cf. ch. 82 *)/agios: called Agesilaus in the list of cf. viii. 131 n. *xi/lwn: probably grandson of the famous Ephor (cf. i. 59; Hunt, Rylands Pap. i, pp. 29, 31), and brother of Prinetades (v. 41. 3), the father of Cleomenes' mother. a(rpa/sas: dependent on fqa/sas. The forms of marriage by capture survived at Sparta (Plut. Lyc. 15); Demaratus seems to have turned the form into a reality. On marriage by capture cf.

Plut. l. c.) unless he was one of the bi/deoi who supervised the youths' gymnastics (Paus. iii. 11. 2; Gilbert, i. 26). In any case Leotychides as king would have the seat of honour (57. 2). muri/hs eu)daimoni/hs. The alternative, not seriously meant, is added for rhetorical contrast; cf. vii. 8. g 3, viii. 68. g. katakaluya/menos: obvoluto capite, as a 53). katapto/menos, 'appealing to' (cf. viii. 65. 6 ad fin.). Here it might mean 'laying hold of', as tou=de implies that there was an altar of *zeu\\s e(rkei=os at hand, and his altar would naturally stand in the court-yard (Hom. Od. xxii. 334). *zeu\\s e(rkei=os is the god of the home and also of the family (Soph. Antig. 487; Farnell, Cults, i. 54). He is akin to, though not the same as, *zeu\\s e)fe/stios (i. 44. 2). Demaratus is anxious to get from his mother a denial on oath, hence the ceremony by which he makes her partaker of the sacrifice (spla/gxnwn), and accursed if she (Macan; the muleteer's god Astrabacus into a muleteer. The views taken of Spartan women are widely divergent (Abbott); Plutarch (Lyc. 15; Mor. 228 B, C) represents adultery as unknown (cf. Isoc. Panath. 259), but Aristotle (Pol. 1269 b 22 f., with Newman) accuses them of every kind of excess. The Heroon lay just outside the door from the court to the street. For Astrabacus cf. Paus. to them near that of Lycurgus (Paus. iii. 16. 6), and presumably near that of Artemis. The heroes are usually connected with the fox and the sumpter-mule, a)stra/bh being a pack-saddle, but Wide (Lakon. Kulte, p. 279) interprets 'one riding on a mule-saddle', and compares Dionysus. Their insertion in the genealogy of the royal house is clearly month is not here mentioned. Plutarch (Agis, ch. 11) mentions an old law invoked against Agis IV, forbidding any Heracleid to settle abroad under pain of death. But this law was not enforced against Dorieus, and if Demaratus was not son of Ariston and king, he was no Heracleid (Macan). Zacynthus proved a less secure refuge for Hegesistratus (ix. 37 ad fin.). It is noticeable that Themistocles too escaped to Persia by way of western Greece (Thuc. i. 136, 137). According to Xenophon (Hell. iii. i. 6; cf. Anab. ii. 1. 3, vii. 8. 17) Xerxes gave Demaratus the cities Pergamus, Halisarna, and Teuthrania in the Troad, which his descendants, Procles and Eurysthenes, still retained. We may compare the rewards given to Gongylus, the Eretrian traitor (Xen. Hell. iii. 1. 6), to Themistocles (Thuc. i. 138), and to Histiaeus and Coes (v. 11). *lakedaimoni/oisi, 'in the opinion of the Spartans'; cf. iii. 88. 2. Their opinion is not justified by his recorded deeds or sayings (Plut. Mor. 220). He plays a greater part at the Persian court (vii. 3, 101 f., 209, 234 f.). prose/bale: conferred on them the honour of an Olympic victory, perhaps by having the victory proclaimed in the name of the city and not in his own (cf. 103. 2). For the irregular construction cf. i. 85. 1. Leotychides and his fate later. The grand-daughter of Zeuxidamus, Cynisca was the first woman to win a prize at Olympia with horses (Paus. iii. 8. 1, vi. 1. 6; Frazer, ad loc.). This she is said to have done at the suggestion of her brother Agesilaus to prove that such victories were a mere question of expense, not of merit (Plut. Ages. 20) (Abbott). *lampitw/: in Plato, Alc. i. 124; Plut. Ages. 1*lampidw/, mother of Agis II. The object of marrying Lampito to her nephew was to prevent rivalry between the families. e)strath/ghse. Two tyrants, Aristomedes and Angelus, are said to have been expelled (Plut. de Mal. 21). This expedition is usually placed soon after the repulse of Xerxes, and regarded as an attempt to punish the Medism of the Aleuadae, the princes of Larisa (cf. vii. 6, 130, ix. 58; Paus. iii. 7. 9), as Thebes had been already punished (ix. 86 f.), and as it was proposed to punish other traitors (cf. vii. 132, 213). Busolt (iii. 80-7) takes the expedition as part of the Spartan policy of turning the Amphictyonic league into a weapon against Medism, and fixes the expedition with Duncker in 476 B. C., explaining the erroneous dating of the reign of Archidamus in Diodorus (xii. 35) 476-434 B. C., as due to a confusion between the banishment of Leotychides 476 B. C. and his death 469 B. C. E. Meyer, however (F. ii. 504-9), argues that the crown passed to Archidamus, not at the death, but on the exile of Leotychides (Thuc. iii. 26, v. 16; Xen. Hell. iii. 5. 25, v. 2. 6), and therefore that the exile of Leotychides must be placed in 469-468 and the expedition shortly before, as soon as Sparta had put down opposition in the Peloponnese. In view, however, of the case of Agesipolis, whose twenty years in exile are reckoned in his reign (Diod. xiii. 75), Busolt's solution is preferable. (For another suggestion cf. Grote abridged, 273, ed. note.) dikasth/rion: for the court cf. v. 40 n. The Spartans were considered corruptible (iii. 56), and the charge is specifically made against both Ephors and Gerontes (Ar. Pol. ii. 9, 1270 b 9 f., 1271 a 3). Of the kings Cleomenes resists Maeandrius (iii. 148), and with difficulty Aristagoras (v. 51 f.), yet he is suspect in the case of Argos (ch. 82), while Pleistoanax and his adviser were bribed by Pericles (Thuc. v. 16; Plut. Per. 22). Of other distinguished Spartans, Eurybiades was believed to have been bribed by Themistocles (viii. 5), and Pausanias trusted to bribery to secure his acquittal (Thuc. i. 131). *tege/hn. So Hegesistratus took refuge in Tegea (ix. 37. 4), as did the king Pausanias in the temple of Athena Alea (Paus. iii. 5. 6). Cleomenes takes hostages of Aegina. The exile, restoration, and awful death of Cleomenes, with theories accounting for his fate. Digression on his earlier defeat of the Argives, and their desperate condition. u(pece/sxe (cf. v. 72. 1). Ephialtes, too, took refuge in Thessaly (vii. 213. 2). *nw/nakrin. In northern Arcadia, near the river Crathis (i. 145), some five hours north-west of the city of Pheneus, to which it belonged. e)corkou=n: with acc. of the object by which the oath is taken; cf. Hom. Il. Although this is the only instance recorded in history, there can be no doubt that an oath by the water of Styx had always been regarded by the Arcadians as most solemn, and that when the poets made the gods swear by Styx, they only transferred to heaven a practice long customary on earth. Hom. Il. xv. The Styx to be instantly fatal (Paus. viii. Plin. Nat. Hist. ii. \u00a7 231, xxxi. \u00a7 26) and to burst or corrode all vessels save those of horn. Yet it is chemically harmless, though being snow-water it is icy cold. Perhaps its supposed deadliness caused it to be used as a kind of ordeal. Such oaths, accompanied by draughts or libations of water, are common (Frazer, Paus. iv. 254). The Styx is the only considerable waterfall in Greece, but H. is right in calling the stream o)li/gon (Tozer, G. p. 118). Frazer (Paus. iv. 252) describes the scene as one of 'sublime but wild and desolate grandeur'. *fenew=|: at the south-west foot of Mount Cyllene, quite eight hours from the Styx, but the nearest large town. It is remarkable for its lake, which at intervals is drained away through subterranean channels (katavothra) into the Ladon, leaving a rich swampy plain (Frazer, iv. 231-2, 235 f.; J. H. S. xxii. 228-40). An Arcadia combined into a federal league, traces of which are found on coins (Hill, G. and R. C. 107), would have been a serious menace to Sparta. The project of Cleomenes seems to have been revived by Themistocles, for all Arcadia, except Mantinea, fought against Sparta at Dipaea (ix. 35). It was realized by Epaminondas. e)s *)eleusi=na: cf. v. 74. tw=n and Persephone. For sacrilege at Eleusis and its consequences cf. ix. 65. katagine/wn. Probably 'bringing home', as Cleomenes gave out that he would take a ransom (79. 1); Stein, however, prefers 'bringing down', as the grove of Argos lay on a hill. Macan follows Panofsky in holding that these variant accounts do not represent genuine local traditions, but are conjectures due to the historian. Clearly, however, there was a general belief that Cleomenes came to a bad end, while each people would naturally select the impiety which injured itself as the ground of heaven's vengeance. Again, H. distinguishes his own opinion (ch. 84) from these more widely accepted views. Some critics, quite needlessly, see in the story of Cleomenes' awful death a Spartan fiction devised to hide the fact that he was put out of the way as a danger to the state. The arguments for dating this war between Sparta and Argos after 500 B. C., and not (with Paus. iii. 4. 1) just after 520 B. C., are given in Appendix XVII, \u00a7 3. *stumfhli/dos li/mnhs. The lake of Stymphalus, near the foot of Mount Cyllene, may be 1 1/2 miles in length and half a mile in breadth, but its area has varied greatly at different times. An escarpment of rock runs down sheer into the water, and at the foot of this there is an arched cavern through which the lake is discharged (Tozer, G. p. 112). The view that the water which here enters the cavern reappears as the Erasinus near Argos is still held by the natives of the valley, and is generally accepted, though the distance (thirty miles) is much greater than the length of any of the other subterraneous rivers of the Peloponnese, and several high mountains and intersecting ridges intervene (Leake, Morea, iii. 113; cf. further Frazer, Paus. iv. 268-75). *)erasi/nou. The river Erasinus was at that time the southern boundary of Argolis; Cleomenes sacrificed to the river-god (au)tw=| the usual diabath/ria (cf. Thuc. v. 54), but the omens were unfavourable (ou)k e)kallie/ree) (cf. ix. 36, 38). *qure/hn: in Spartan territory (i. 82), and near the shore (Thuc. iv. 57). tau=ron: so Od. Aegina, in spite of the suzerainty claimed by Argos over both cities; cf. ch. 92. Macan suggests that the demonstration on the Erasinus was a feint to draw the Argives away from the city, as the ships must have been summoned beforehand. e)pi/koina: adverbial (i. 216. 1). For the Milesian half of the response cf. ch. 19n. The oracle is obscure enough to be regarded as a genuine Pythian response. It is not easy to see how it could raise a suspicion of trickery, unless it be assumed that the victory of the female over the male implies a success won by craft over force. But at least three interpretations are possible: 1. Hera of Argos shall defeat and drive out him of Lacedaemon (Cleomenes or Apollo), but it will be a Cadmeian victory, bringing mourning and ruin on Argos. But unless the first lines be applied to the expulsion of Cleomenes by Hera (ch. 82), they promise Argos a victory not recorded by H. 2. Sparta (female) shall conquer Argos (a male hero), so the women of Argos shall make lamentation, and men in time to come count that day the ruin of Argos. In this case, however, e)cela/sh| remains unexplained. 3. Later authors (Pausanias, ii. 20. 8; Plutarch, Moralia, p. 245 D, E, quoting Socrates of Argos, F. H. G. iv. 497) tell us how Telesilla, the poetess, armed the women, the infirm, and the slaves, and drove back Cleomenes from the defenceless town after his victory in the field. This tradition, which fits the oracle admirably, is clearly of local Argive origin, whereas H. gives us the official Spartan version, which presents obvious difficulties (cf. ch. 82 n.). But the story of Telesilla appears to be late and is most probably unhistorical, since it seems designed to explain the oracle, and the festival of Wantonness (ta\\ *(ubristika/) at Argos. At this feast the women dressed as men and the men as women, even wearing veils (Plutarch, l. c.; Polyaenus, viiii. 33). Such exchange of garments is a widely spread religious custom, particularly at the time of marriage; thus Argive brides wore beards (Plutarch, l. c.) and Spartan brides men's clothes on their wedding nights (Plut. Lyc. 15). So too there was in Cyprus a sacrifice to a bearded Aphrodite, at which men were dressed as women and women as men (Macrob. Sat. iii. 8; Servius on Aen. ii. 632); for other parallels see Frazer, Paus. iii. 197; Farnell, ii. 634-5, 748 n. 104. Again, Lucian (Amores 30) says that in consequence of Telesilla's victory the war-god (Ares) was deemed at Argos a god of women, and Plutarch adds (l. c.) that the victorious women built a temple to the war-god (Enyalius), but in view of Pausanias' statement that the statue of Telesilla stood in front of the temple of Aphrodite, it seems likely that the supposed war-god is really an armed Aphrodite, a goddess of Eastern origin (cf. i. 105 n.; Frazer, iii. 338; Farnell, ii. 653-4). The story of Telesilla then seems to be an aetiological myth, founded on a misunderstood rite and a misinterpreted oracle. Wells (op. cit. pp. 91-4) defends the historical character of the tale of Telesilla. a)mfidrufe/as: Homeric (Il. of Hermes, who slew Argos or Panoptes, was interpreted as o)fiokto/nos. Hence, though the proper crest of Argos is the wolf or wolf's head (Busolt, i. 214), the serpent is used as the symbol of Argos (Soph. Ant. 125 and borne as arms by Adrastus (Eur. Phoen. 1137). It may be added that Sepeia gives further point, since like Mount Sepia in Arcadia, it doubtless got its name from the presence there of the sh/y, a dangerous viper (= o)/fis) described by Pausanias. See Paus. viii. 4. 7, 16. 2, Frazer, ad loc. trie/liktos, 'of three coils' (cf. trika/rhnos, ix. 81 for a)e/liktos, 'coilless.' tau=ta pa/nta sunelqo/nta: loosely used of two things (cf. v. 36. 1), said by Stein to be the invasion and the oracle, but this is vague and unsatisfactory. Bury (Klio ii. 19) ingeniously suggests that one portent (o)/fis trie/liktos) was realized, in that Sepeia, the place of snakes, was in danger, and the other, the driving forth of the male by the female, in that the waters of the river Erasinus, a male divinity, were driven forth by the Stymphalian lake, a female (cf. 76). The explanation is far-fetched, but not more so than other interpretations. It might well have occurred to the Argives, though not contemplated at Delphi. Polyaenus (Strat. i. 14) repeats the improbable story here given. Plutarch (Mor. 223) says Cleomenes tricked the Argives by agreeing to a truce for seven days, and attacking them on the third night. This may be an Argive excuse for defeat, but H.'s story may be 'a Spartan version devised to disguise the king's breach of faith' (Macan). a)/poina, 'ransom' (Homeric); cf. ix. 120. 3. For the tariff of two minas cf. v. 77. 3. The weight attached to the oracle by a king who knew that oracles could be bought (ch. 66), and who neither here nor elsewhere (at the Heraeum (81), at Eleusis (75), or at Athens (v. 72)), shrank from sacrilege, is a glaring inconsistency. It is most unlikely that Cleomenes after a great victory would allow himself to be robbed of its fruits by any such scruple. More probable explanations of his failure to attack the town are (1) the bribery alleged (ch. 82, cf. 72 n.); or (2) reluctance to face great loss of life in storming the wall, and consciousness of the Spartans lack of skill in siege operations (ix. 70; Thuc. i. 102; cf. Busolt, Lakedaimonier, i. 335); or (3) unwillingness to destroy Argos, 'the kite which frightened the other cities of the Akte to take refuge under the wing of Sparta,' and by her close connexion with Aegina kept Corinth loyal to Sparta (Grundy, Thuc. i. 223; J. H. S. xxviii. 85). The Heraeum stood on a terraced hill at the foot of a bare steep mountain, some forty-five stades north-east of Argos, and but twenty-five south-east from Mycenae, with which it was connected by a sacred road. The temple entered by Cleomenes was burnt down in 423 B. C. (Thuc. iv. 133), and a new one built immediately below it. For a summary of the results of the American excavations cf. Frazer, Paus. iii. 165-79 and v. 561-2. o( i(reu/s. Probably a subordinate attendant (za/koros). Cleomenes would hardly have scourged the priestess of Hera (cf. i. 31). For the incident cf. v. 72. u(po\\ tou\\s e)fo/rous. The ephors may have held a preliminary inquiry, but such a charge must have come before the court described in v. 40 n.; cf. vi. 72, 85. ai(re/ein a)/n = h(/|reon a)/n, caperem.

The explanation for which H. pointedly refuses to be responsible (\u00a7 1) was satisfactory to the Spartans. Probably the plea was really used by Cleomenes and became the official Spartan account. a)ndrw=n Aen. viii. 571. The number of fallen is given as 6,000 by H. (vii. 148. 2), as 5,000 by Pausanias (iii. 4. 1). Later Argive tradition (ridiculed by Plutarch, Mor. 245) chose the sacred number 7,777, but this, as well as the stories that Cleomenes made a truce for seven days (Plut. Mor. 223) and that the battle was fought on the seventh day of the month (Ar. Pol. v. 3. 7, 1303 a 6), is no doubt due to the connexion with the festival of the Hubristika. oi( dou=loi. There appear to have been at Argos serfs (known as *gumnh/sioi), resembling the Spartan Helots (Pollux, iii. 83), who might be described as dou=loi, though, like the Helots, they served as lightarmed. Plutarch, however (Mor. 243), attacks of the same type as the Spartan Perioeci were granted citizenship and ii. 75; Susemihl, ad loc.) in agreement with Plutarch; but Newman (ad loc.) holds that there as elsewhere Aristotle means by 'Perioeci' serfs. If so, H. is justified in calling them dou=loi. For a fuller account of the troubles of the Argives cf. P. A. Seymour in J. H. S. xlii, pp. 24 f. Though Argos was professedly neutral in the Persian war, Tiryns and Mycenae sent hoplites to Plataea (ix. 28. 4) and had their names inscribed on the three-headed snake (ix. 81 n.). They were therefore at that period independent. For the remains of Tiryns see Frazer, iii. 217-30. *figaleu/s. Phigaleia is south-west Arcadia, near the Messenian frontier, and is built on a high plateau, bounded by deep glens, surrounded on three sides by mountains. Four miles off is the famous temple of Bassae (Frazer, Paus. iv. 390-404). The war ended in the destruction of Tiryns and Mycenae (Paus. v. 23. 3; vii. 25. 6; ii. 16. 5; 25. 8). An aggressive war on the part of Tiryns is only conceivable if Argos was engaged elsewhere. Now about 472 Argos was allied to Tegea against the Spartans (cf. ix. 35 n.), by whom the allies were defeated near Tegea, but in the next great battle, fought by the Arcadians against the Spartans at Dipaea (circ. 470), the Argives took no part. The suggestion seems probable that Tiryns was encouraged to attack Argos by the battle of Tegea, and that the Argives were absent from the field of Dipaea because they were fully occupied in the siege of Tiryns, which was obstinately defended (Busolt, iii. 121 f.). Possibly Mycenae too fell at this time (468 B. C.). More probably, however, it was while Sparta was occupied with the Helot revolt after 464 B. C. (Diod. xi. 65); cf. Busolt, iii. 244; Meyer, iii, \u00a7 325. Neither city was left so completely desolate as Strabo (372) implies, as is proved by remains at Mycenae (Frazer, iii. 97 f.). Tirynthians found refuge at Halieis (viii. 137. 2 n.). tou\\s noma/das: of the whole nation (cf. iv. 11. 1), not the particular section (iv. 19). This programme of a joint attack on the Persian is even more magnificent than the scheme of Aristagoras (v. 49-54). But it is even less likely to have been conceived by a Scyth than by the astute Milesian. The whole story seems like a spiteful bit of gossip invented to explain the term e)piskuqi/zein. For Scythian raids on upper Asia cf. i. 104. 2; iv. 11. 1; 12. 3; and Append. XII. a)krhtoposi/hn. The Greeks diluted their wine with water, and to drink undiluted wine was dangerous and barbaric. Athen. 36 b unmixed wine. (We may compare the use of a)poskuqi/zein for scalping, described in iv. 64. 2.) The verb may have had the origin here attributed to it (cf. Athenaeus x. 7, 427 b), but Anacreon (fl. 540 B. C.) is quoted (Athen. l. c.) for a similar phrase and practice: *skuqikh\\n po/sin par) oi)/nw| meletw=men. The refusal of Athens to restore at the request of Leotychides the Aeginetan hostages leads to renewed hostilities between Aegina and Athens. The change in Spartan policy, indicated by the demand for the restoration of the Aeginetan hostages, is in all probability subsequent to the battle of Marathon and the Parian expedition, its motive being fear of Athenian ambition. For the chronology cf. ch. 93 n. For the hostages cf. ch. 73, and for the court v. 40 n. o(/kws mh\\ e)sba/lwsi. Only here does H. use independent o(/pws mh/ with the subjunctive, expressing a desire to avert something (Goodwin, \u00a7\u00a7 278, 280; v. 79. 2 n.). The beautiful tale of Glaucus, with its high moral, is strangely placed in the mouth of a man who had reached the throne by corruption of the Pythia (ch. 65), and who was himself corrupt (ch. 72). Neither this nor the inexactitude of the parallel between Glaucus and the Athenians induces H. to sacrifice so good a story. profa/sias ei(=lkon: perhaps 'lengthen out excuses', but 'drag in by the hair of the head' suit circ. 550 B. C., when Miletus was much troubled by internal dissensions (v. 28 n.). i(kneume/nw|, 'at the appointed time,' fatali tempore, 'in the fullness of time'; cf. 65. 3 n. The fall of a house is the work of fate, no mere chance. a)podou=nai: infinitive for imperative, usually, as here, joined with an imperative; cf. iii. 134. 5, 155. 5; v. 23. 3. su/mbola might be merely the token of friendship (tessera hospitalis; cf. schol. ad Eur. Med. 613), which would prove to Glaucus that the applicants were heirs of the Milesian, but here probably = tallies, proofs of the agreement such as two halves of a broken coin. me perife/rei, 'nothing you say brings me to remember the fact.' perife/rei is here active, 'remettre en m\u00e9moire'; laws of the Greeks, recognized by Spartan and Ionian alike. Glaucus will make a public and legal disavowal of the deposit on oath (cf. g). lhi/shtai: cf. iii. 47. 2, and especially the broken oath personified, yet without name or visible form. For similar phrases cf. viii. line is from Hesiod, where a)mei/nwn = beatior, and is The penalty of the destruction of the house, which would leave the dead ancestors without the honours due to them, the gods without their sacrifices, the hearth without its flame, is the most fearful known to the primitive moralist. Individual punishment in the life after death is a later idea. It was a maxim in Attic of tempting God cf. i. 159. tw=n pro/teron a)dikhma/twn: cf. v. 81. H. regards the Aeginetans as again the aggressors, though they might justly complain of the refusal of Athens to restore the hostages. pentethri/s: a quadrennial festival like the Panathenaea (ch. iii. 2, v. 56). A regatta was held off Sunium (Lys. xxi. 5), probably in honour of Poseidon (Paus. ii. 35. 1), to whom the great temple on the cape was dedicated (viii. 121 n.), while that of Athena (Paus. i. 1) lay a quarter of a mile to the north-east. For Greek boat-races cf. P. Gardner, J. H. S. ii. 90 f., 315 f., xi. 146 f. th\\n qewri/da: the ship conveying the qewroi/ from Athens to Sunium. Macan (App. VIII, \u00a7 5) ingeniously suggests that these captives were exchanged for the Aeginetan hostages. Both, in spite of their importance (78), disappear henceforth from view. *knoi/qou kaleo/menos, 'son of Cnoethus,' an expression not uncommon in poetry. Cf. also vii. 143. 1 and Thuc. viii. 6. th\\n palaih/n. Probably the old city was some few miles from the coast, as was the ancient practice (Thuc. i. 7). tou=ton to\\n xro/non. Corinth had twice saved Athens from Spartan aggression about 506 B. C. (v. 75, 92), and had long found it to her interest to support Athens against the stronger power of Aegina. Her friendship did not survive the creation of the great Athenian navy by Themistocles (vii. 144), as is shown by the enmity of Adimantus in 480 B. C. (viii. 61 f.). It turned into active hostility circ. 458 B. C. (Thuc. i. 105 f.). pentadra/xmous: five drachmas (i.e. francs) a piece is of course a nominal price. For the Corinthians' conduct the Athenian ships, fifty, making with twenty Corinthian vessels the total seventy, may be an inference from the fifty naucraries of the Cleisthenic constitution (Cleidemus, fr. 8, F. H. G. i. 360). In ch. 132 the Athenian fleet sent to Paros is seventy sail, as is the Aeginetan in ch. 92. 1; but these numbers may rest on the total given here, the Aeginetan fleet being presumed to be equal in number to the enemy; and even if the number of Miltiades' fleet be correct, we may suppose that it included as transports ships unfit for action, or, again, that the Athenian navy had been allowed to decay between 489 and 486 B. C. Macan indeed argues that though the principal war is subsequent to Marathon, the Corinthian loan of ships must be placed earlier (possibly during the Ionic revolt, 498 B. C.), because '(1) Miltiades took seventy ships to Paros, (2) it is scarcely credible the Corinthian gift to Athens was after Marathon'. But the loan of ships can hardly be separated from the great war which he rightly places circ. 486 (cf. inf. ch. 93 n.), and Corinth would still prefer Athens to Aegina till Themistocles made the navy of Athens superior; so it is easier to suppose an error in the number of Miltiades' fleet than to dislocate the whole narrative of Herodotus. With this settlement of raiding exiles cf. the Corcyreans at Mount Istone (Thuc. iii. 85; iv. v. Samians 75), Lesbians at Rhoeteum and Antandrus (Thuc. iv. 52, 75). u(/steron: i.e. on any theory after 490 B. C., the rising of Nicodromus being probably in H.'s view before Marathon. Even if the rising be dated 486 B. C. there is still room for an interval, as the war with Aegina went on till 481 (vii. 144. 1, 145. 1). e)kpeso/ntes pro/teron. Cf. that Thucydides should give the political ground and that H. should palliate Athenian violence by representing the expulsion of the Aeginetans as a consequence of their own impiety. This notice of the expulsion of the Aeginetans 431 B. C. is one of the latest references in H.'s work, and written when old stories were eagerly raked up at Athens against the Aeginetans. The historian can hardly have known of the later extirpation of the Aeginetans settled at Thyrea in 424 B. C. (Thuc. iv. 57) or he would not have failed to allude to it (cf.

Since Sicyon paid the fine, at a time when Argos was too weak to enforce it, probably Argos had the right to impose it, as head of a religious association and guardian of the temple of Apollo Pythaeus (Thuc. v. 53. 47, with Busolt, Lakedaimonier, p. 83 f.). But the presidency of a religious amphictyony could be, and was by Pheidon, used to advance a claim to political suzerainty over the whole 'lot of Temenus'. penta/eqlon e)paskh/sas (cf. ix. 105). 'Having practised the pentathlum' (cf. ix. 75) implies a victory which Pausanias (i. 29. 5) tells us was won at Nemea. For the Pentathlum cf. ix. 33. 2 n. e)paske/wn: practising, i.e. engaging in single combat. Cf. ii. 77. 1, 166. 2; iii. 82. 3. For Sophanes cf. ix. 74, 75, and for Decelea ix. 73. The story breaks off short. Apparently the Athenians are successful both on sea (92. 1; Thuc. i. 41) and land (92. 3); yet we find their fleet in disorder (93), and defeated with the loss of four ships. No doubt the Argive corps suffered severely in the land-fight, but only a success of the Aeginetans on land can account for a second seabattle, and the disorder and final retreat of the Athenians. Hence it has been proposed to transfer to this war the events given by H. as the Argive and Aeginetan version of the earlier war (v. 86, 87 n.; Busolt, ii. 648). That Aegina had the better in the war is proved by the increase of the Athenian navy, which was justified by the exigencies of this war. The date of this war has been much discussed. H. placed its outbreak before Marathon, as is shown by its position in his narrative and by the for preferring a later date (circ. 488-486) are very strong. 1. The accession of Leotychides, since it follows the arrival of the heralds of Darius, must be placed late in 491 B. C. There is not time before Marathon (490 B. C.) for the discovery of the corruption of the Pythia, the exile of Cleomenes, his restoration and his death (85. 1). Yet his death preceded the demand for the return of the hostages, which led to this war. 2. The Aeginetan war is always treated as the ground or pretext for the creation of a great Athenian navy by Themistocles (vii. 144; Thuc. i. 14), dated by Ath. Pol. 22 to 483 B. C., and clearly immediately preceded the invasion of Xerxes, since in 480 the feud between Athens and Aegina is still the bitterest among patriotic Greeks (vii. 145). The connexion of the Aeginetan war with the Attic navy dates it to the years preceding Salamis. Did the war belong to 491-490 B. C. we might well ask what were the Aeginetans about when Datis and Artaphrenes sacked Eretria and threatened Athens. 3. The oracle (v. 89) bidding the Athenians wait thirty years for their revenge would seem to be a vaticinium post eventum dating from 458 B. C., when Aegina was reduced. If so, it would refer to the greatest war between Athens and Aegina and would date it about 488 B. C. (cf. v. 89 n.). 4. If the Argive war of Cleomenes be correctly placed, circ. 495 B. C. (cf. App. XVII. 3), it would be barely possible that Argos should send a thousand volunteers as early as 490 B. C., though she might have sufficiently recovered to do so four years later. On the whole question cf. Macan, App. VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6; Busolt, ii. 644 f. 5. The dispatch of the whole navy (cf. 89 n.) to Paros in 489 B. C. is irreconcilable with a still undecided struggle with Aegina. Datis and Artaphrenes sail across Cyclades, Carystus, and Eretria.

Inscr. ii. 14. 6; iii. 14. 3). Here Datis is evidently in command; Artaphrenes, who was probably still young, seems to hold an honorary position. He is son (vii. 74) of Artaphrenes, brother of Darius, once satrap of Sardis (v. 25 f.). *)alh/ion pedi/on, said to derive its name from a town Alae (Steph.

To H. the natural course is to coast round the shores of the Aegean, as did Mardonius (ch. 43) and Xerxes (Bk.

Though the resistance of the Naxians was successful in 500 B. C., the hardships of the four months' siege may have been severe. Further, the failure of the Ionic revolt had no doubt dispirited the Greeks of the islands. Plutarch (de Mal. Her. 36, Mor. 869 B) follows the Naxian chroniclers (w(rogra/foi) in declaring that Datis, after laying waste the town and part of the island, was repulsed by the Naxians. But the subjugation of Naxos is proved by viii. 46. 3, and could only be doubted by a blind patriotism. o)/rea: the interior of Naxos is mountainous. The capital was on the north-west coast. *dh=los.

Rhenaea is but half a mile away and is much larger than Delos, to which, however, Polycrates made it an appendage.

The Persians may well have seen in them their own gods of sun and moon, Mithra and Mah (cf. i. 131. 2). But Datis may also have wished to please his Ionian sailors, or have been influenced by Hippias. To turn the religious meetings of Ionians at Delos to political account is an idea of Pisistratus (Thuc. iii. 104) which may well have been adopted by Hippias, as it was later by democratic Athens. In any case toleration was the policy of the Persian monarchs (E. Meyer, iii, \u00a7 57), and in particular of Darius; cf. his letter kind of remark is made ii. 1. 2, iii. 1. 1. It may be added here to mark the fact that the Greeks of Asia and the Islands were now first compelled to fight against their kinsmen in the mother country (Abbott). seisqei=sa. Thucydides (ii. 8), speaking of be doubted that Delian tradition, as H. says, recognized only one earthquake, and that Thucydides is deliberately correcting the date given by his predecessor. Nor can H., when he visited Delos (cf. w(s e)/legon *dh/lioi, me/xri e)meu=), or when he wrote the passage, as it would seem (c. 92) after the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, have heard of more than one earthquake. Hence it is unlikely that the historians refer to two separate earthquakes. It is, however, probable that both misdated the earthquake. H. must be taken to mean soon after the departure of Datis, i. e. 490 B. C., or at least before the invasion of Xerxes in 480 B. C. Thucydides, although a little later (ii. 16) he hardly date before 445 by the phrase o)li/gon pro\\ tou/twn. Possibly the earthquake really occurred some time before H.'s visit, circ. 460 B. C., and was connected by credulous piety either with the Persian or the Peloponnesian war, and its date altered accordingly. But certainty is unattainable. According to Pindar (fr. 58 (65), ap. Strabo 485), Delos was borne about by winds and waves till Leto gave birth to her children there; afterwards it was firmly fixed, supported on four iron columns. Darius reigned 522-486 B. C., Xerxes 486-465 B. C., Artaxerxes 465-424 B. C. (vii. 4 n.). The words do not imply that Artaxerxes' reign was over, nor does H. elsewhere refer clearly to an event so late. Cf. Introd. \u00a7 9. Yet the identification of these three reigns with three generations\u2014that is, one hundred years (ii. 142. 2)\u2014 implies that the passage was written nearly a century after the accession of Darius; and though the war between the leaders of Greece might be the battle of Tanagra, and other hostilities before 445 B. C., the phrase has far more point if written in the early years of the Peloponnesian war. Twenty generations = 666 2/3 years (ii. 142. 2), so the period intended is 1189-522 B. C. H. seems to place the Trojan war circ. 1260 B. C. (ii. 145 ad fin.), and the Dorian migration was usually dated some eighty years later, so that the meaning would be that never since the return of the Heracleids had Greece been so troubled. a)eike/s: poetical = ou)k betrays the interpolation of the quotation. du/natai kale/oien. These words have but a slight connexion with the context, and look like a footnote appended either by the historian or by a commentator. The ignorance of Persian is similar to that shown elsewhere (cf. i. 131, 139 nn.). The author evidently believes that Artaxerxes is a compound of Xerxes, whereas the Persian forms Khshay\u00e2rsh\u00e2 and Artakhshathra are plainly distinct. Nor are the translations in any sense accurate. D\u00e2rayavau probably means 'he who holds goods', bonorum possessor, though it might perhaps e(/ktwr, Lat. coercitor. Khshay\u00e2rsh\u00e2 ='the mighty prince'. If Khshaya can = Shah, perfect.' Arta = perfect, excelsum; shathra = regnum. See further Darmesteter in Abbott, p. 330, and Meyer, Forsch. i. 194-5. A. B. Cook (Cl. R. xxi. e)rci/hs, *)artace/rchs ka/rta e)rci/hs, so as to connect the Persian names with the Greek words similar to them. Carystus, famous for its green and white marble (cipollino), lay in a deep bay on the south coast of Euboea. The Carystians, being Dryopians (Thuc. vii. 57), were not kinsmen of Ionians. Their unwillingness to attack their neighbours may have been prompted by trade connexions (iv. 33 n.). They suffered later for yielding now and for joining Xerxes in 480 B. C. (viii. 66. 112). Indeed, their subjugation by Athens (ix. 105; Thuc. i. 98) was doubtless justified by the charge of Medism. tou\\s tetrakisxili/ous: cf. v. 77. 2 n. Clearly H. is anxious to justify the Athenian people for not sending succour from Attica, and the Athenian cleruchs for leaving Eretria to its fate, by emphasizing the divided counsels and positive treachery of the Eretrians. After Marathon it may well have been thought that a bold stand might have been made at Eretria. At the time so heroic a counsel could only be justified if the Eretrians, like the Athenians, were willing to meet the Persians in the open field. It is likely enough that in Eretria, which had favoured Pisistratus (i. 62), the Medizing party was strong, but H. implies that there was but one true man, Aeschines, in a rotten State. Curiously enough Xenophon (Hell. iii. 1. 6) says there was but one Eretrian who Medized, Gongylus; and his treachery seems to have been of later date, as he is lieutenant and agent of Pausanias in Byzantium B. C. 478-477 (Thuc. i. 128). For his reward cf. ch. 42 n. i)de/as, 'their thoughts took two shapes or forms'; cf. 119. 2. So too o(do/s, i. 95. 1; ii. 20. 1. ta\\ prw=ta: unus e primoribus.

A distinction seems to be drawn between the enslavement of the men by order of Darius (94. 2) and this perhaps unauthorized act of vengeance. The burning of temples is not infrequent (v. 102 n.), but the motive of the war was not religious, nor should this view be attributed to H. (as by Wecklein, Ber. der bayer. Akad. (1878), 263 f.). Eretria (for whose earlier history cf. v. 99 n.) never recovered after its destruction, though it was rebuilt on the old site (American Journal of Archaeology, vii, 233 f.), and sent seven ships to Salamis (viii. 46. 2), and, with its colony Styra, 600 hoplites to Plataea (ix. 28. 5).

If the text be sound, kate/rgontes is probably transitive, 'bringing the Athenians into great straits' (cf. v. 63. 4), not intransitive, 'in great haste'. *maraqw/n: here used for the whole district, the Tetrapolis, not merely the deme of Marathon. But it is not so near Eretria as Rhamnus or Oropus, and not such good ground for cavalry as the Athenian or the Thriasian plains. Though the plain of Marathon extends in a perfect level along the bay, and is in length about six miles, and in breadth at least a mile and a half, the ground is by no means as favourable to the Persians as it appeared. It is divided into two halves by a mountain torrent (Charadra) which rushes down from Mount Pentelicus. And the apparent length of the plain is deceptive, for at either extremity there is a marsh. That on the south-west is small, but that on the north-east is extensive and impassable, reaching from the mountains almost to the sea. On the reasons for landing at Marathon, and for the absence of the Persian horse from the battle, cf. App. XVIII, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 8. o( de/katos.

The Prytaneum stood later on the north-west of the Acropolis (Paus. i. 18. 3, with Frazer), and there seems no sufficient reason for the hypothesis (Curtius and D\u00f6rpfeld) of an earlier Prytaneum south of the Acropolis (E. A. Gardner, Athens, p. 126). u(pei/santes. This is the only instance recorded in which the Athenian tyrants adopted Periander's policy (cf. v. 92 h between the long walls (Gardner, Athens, 65-6), probably in the hollow between the hill of the Nymphs and that of the Pnyx, where the city deme Melite adjoins the surburban Koile.

These enemies were probably the same who prosecuted him later with more success (ch. 136), Xanthippus and his Alcmaeonid friends. They might easily excite the people against a tyrant whose dominion over the Chersonese had the support of the Pisistratidae, although his father had been murdered by them. For internal politics at Athens cf. v. 103 n., vi. 21 n.; App. XVIII, \u00a7 6. strathgo\\s ai(reqei\\s this means election by the Ecclesia, and not by a single tribe, it is an anachronism (Ath. Pol. 22, cit. sup.), but probably H. is only contrasting the people as an electoral body with the judicial dicastery. It is most improbable that Athens had no understanding with Sparta before the mission of Philippides. Indeed, his hasty dispatch by the generals seems an appeal to an existing ally to fulfil her obligations. But if, as Busolt (ii. 580) suggests, Sparta had concluded only an e)pimaxi/a with Athens, the casus foederis would only arise when the Persians directly attacked Attica (Thuc. i. 44; v. 47, 48, &c.). Nor could the Athenians reasonably demand aid until they had resolved to risk a battle in the field (Hauvette, 250). *filippi/dhs, though only found in the second family of MSS., is supported by the other authorities (Paus. i. 28. 4, viii. 54-6; Plut. Herod. Malign. 26, &c.), and almost certainly right. It is a common Athenian name (C. I. A.), whereas Pheidippides is a witticism of Aristophanes (Nub. 67), which he would hardly have dared to make had the name been consecrated in the tale of Marathon. Mount Parthenion divides the little plain of Hysiae from that of Tegea. It is crossed directly by the 'ladder of the Bey', a path paved in Turkish style with large unhewn blocks, and one of the wildest and most desolate tracks in Greece (Paus. viii. 54. 6; cf. Frazer, iv. 446). Here we may believe Philippides saw the vision of Pan, though the sanctuary is placed by M. B\u00e9rard on the circuitous carriage-road, where he found an inscription on bronze. *pano\\s i(ro/n. The grottos of Pan and of Apollo have been excavated by M. Cavvadias (1897). There are two caves with narrow entrances, partly blocked by natural pillars of rock, so that they offer complete seclusion, though but narrow space within. These would be suitable for the secret meetings of Apollo and Creusa (Ion 10 f., 492 f., 936 f.), which Pausanias (i. 28. 4) places in the cave of Apollo, but Euripides in that of Pan, as does Aristophanes that of Cinesias and Myrrhina (Lys. 911 f.). Subsequently the worship of Apollo seems to have been transferred to the more open cave where votive tablets were found (Gardner, Athens, p. 93 f.; for a full discussion with plan cf. D'Ooge, Acropolis, pp. 6-9), the more secret caves being now the shrine of Pan. In the grotto was a statue of Pan (Anthol. Plan. 232; cf. 259) with an inscription a statue, now at Cambridge, was discovered in a garden at the foot of the Acropolis, but it appears to have decorated a column or balustrade like the similar statue found in Peiraeus (Michaelis, Ancient Marbles in Great Britain, p. 248). The representations of the cave of Pan on Attic coins of Antonine date, giving views of the Acropolis, appear to be too inaccurate to be of service (J. H. S. viii, pp. 24-5). His worship may have been (katasta/ntwn sfi a torch-race (cf. viii. 98. 2 n.). Browning in his Pheidippides (ii. 582, ed. 1896) accepts Lucian's addition to the story that Pheidippides ran back to fight at Marathon, and died after bringing the news of the victory to Athens, a feat commemorated by the Marathon races of to-day. deuterai=os. Isocrates (Panath. 24) makes the distance 1,200 150 miles. Pliny (vii. \u00a7 84) 'cucurrisse MCLX Lacedaemonem biduo Philippidem'.

The ancient authorities (Paus. i. 28. 4; Plut. infr.; Schol. Arist. Ach. 84, &c.) speak as if this rule was valid for all months, but H. may only mean it to apply to the month Carneius (Attic Metageitnion), when the Carneia, in honour of Apollo Carneius, were celebrated 7th-15th, i. e. up to the full moon (Eur. Alc. 449-51), and all Dorians abstained from warfare (H. vii. 206; Thuc. v. 54. 75). It is, however, to be noticed that in other like cases (vii. 206, ix. 7) he specifies the festival which hindered action. Plutarch's criticism of H. (de the first part vague and inaccurate, and in the second rests on a confusion between the actual day of the battle and that of the yearly festival at which, in fulfilment of a vow of the Polemarch, five hundred goats were sacrificed to Artemis Agrotera (cf. Boeckh, Kl. Schr. iv. 85 f., vi. 329 f.). The most probable date is Metageitnion 17 = Sept. 12, i. e. the full moon of the month Metageitnion which preceded the festival. The speed of the Spartan march seems to show that their desire to help Athens was genuine, and that the battle took place on the first day it was lawful for them to march. For the dream and its interpretation compare that of Caesar (Suet. ch. 7). Styra is a town in south-west Euboea over against Marathon. Aegilia lies just off its harbour. In many lands a sneeze is by itself regarded as ominous, and even to dream of losing a tooth portends death or misfortune (Class. Phil. i. 235; vi. 429 f.). The ancient Marathon must be placed not at the modern Marathona, which is far too near Oenoe (Ninoi) and contains no ancient remains, but, with most topographers from Leake (Top. of Athens, ii. 89-92) to Milch\u00f6fer (Karten von Attika, text, iii, p. 52), at or near Vrana, a commanding site with abundant ancient remains. The camp of the Athenians was probably not at the *ma/ndra th=s *grai/as (Lolling, M. A. I. i, p. 67 f.), since that enclosure seems to be the work of Herodes Atticus in later days and not the precinct of Heracles. Again, if the Athenian camp was in the side valley of Avlona the Persians would be hidden from the Athenians by the intervening ridge of Kotroni; this position too might be threatened in rear by a Persian advance up the Charadra past Oenoe, and would not have guarded the coast road to Athens by Pallene. Further this site, like that under Mount Agrieliki, preferred by Leake and Milch\u00f6fer (l. c.), is waterless. Hence the most suitable position for the Heracleum and the Athenian camp seems to be the convent of St. George on the spur of Mount Aphorismos above Vrana. This contains ancient remains, which may well be those of the Heracleum, the Christian champion having naturally replaced the heathen hero. Cf. Caspari, J. H. S. xxxi. 100 f. (See note, p. 415.) e)dedw/kesan. According to Thucydides (iii. 68) this took place ninety-two years before the destruction of Plataea in 427 B. C., i. e. in 519-518 B. C., a date accepted by Curtius and E. Meyer (ii, \u00a7 478) and defended by Wells (J. H. S. xxv. 193 f.). But Herodotus (cf. v. 76) seems to know nothing of any Spartan expedition against Attica at that date, nor does he mention the presence (paratuxou=si) of Cleomenes in central Greece before his intervention in Attica after the fall of Hippias (509-508 B. C.). Again, an attempt to embroil Athens and Thebes is unlikely when Hippias was on good terms with Sparta (v. 91), but probable enough when Athens had asserted her independence. Busolt (ii. 399) and Macan (ad loc.) adopt Gutschmid's suggestion of an error of *d ( = 10) in an uncial MS. of Thucydides. Cf. further Grote (iv. 94), who first advocated the date 509 B. C., and, per contra, his editors (Abridgement, p. 82). Cf. the speech of the Plataean orator in Thuc. iii. 55. This altar, like that in the Pythium (cf. Hicks, 10), was set up by Pisistratus, son of Hippias, as archon in the Agora, and was afterwards enlarged (Thuc. vi. 54). It was the 'miliarium aureum' of Athens, whence roads in all directions started and distances were measured (ii. 7. 1; Arist. Av. 1005; C. I. A. ii. 1078). It was specially honoured with offerings and processions (Xen. Hipp. iii. 2; Pind. fr. 45). For its use asylum for suppliants cf. Diod. xii. 39; Plut. Per. 31.

'the command' which he conceived as changing every day. This is confirmed by Plut. Arist. ch. 5, and believed by Diodorus (xiii. 97. 106) to have been the case at Arginusae and Aegospotami. Possibly, however, in the source followed by H., prutanei/a may have been used more nearly in its ordinary sense to denote an order of precedence among the tribes and their commanders. Such an arrangement existed in Alexander's army (Arrian, i. 14. 6, 28. 3, &c.). In that case, however, the tribe of Miltiades (Oeneis presumably) should have been on the right wing on the day of the battle, but there is evidence to show it was not. Cf. ch. 111 n., and App. XVIII, \u00a7 4. h(ge/eto. The right wing was the post of honour and of danger in Greek armies (ix. 28. 46; Thuc. v. 71), and was naturally led by the king (Eur. Supp. 657) and by his successor in command (Ath. Pol. 3. 2), the Polemarch; cf. App. XVIII, \u00a7 4. w(s a)riqme/onto ai( fulai/. The fixed official order instituted by of the time of the Peloponnesian war (C. I. A. i. 443, 446, 447). As arrangement by tribes is expressly attested by Pausanias (i. 32. 3) for the monument at Marathon, and is confirmed by the stele of the tribe Erechtheis (459-458 B. C., Hicks 26), this would seem to be the natural meaning here. It is, however, inconsistent with the traditions in Plutarch (Aristid. 5) that the tribes Antiochis and Leontis stood together in the centre, and (Mor. 628 D) that the Aeantis stood on the right of the line. The latter point is confirmed by a reference to an elegy of Aeschylus, and might be explained by the fact that the Polemarch belonged to the tribe Aeantis, only in that case H. would naturally have written ai( a)/llai fulai/. Plutarch implies (Mor. 628 D) that the Aeantis was prutaneu/ousa fulh/ at the time of Marathon. It is likely enough that the order of the tribes in battle was determined by lot, as was that of the Prytanies (Ath. Pol. 43. 2), but improbable that the two were identical. Stein's argument (ch. 103 n.) for placing the Oeneis under Miltiades on the left is not convincing. Five such quadrennial festivals\u2014Delia, Brauronia, Heracleia, Eleusinia, and Panathenaea\u2014are enumerated (Ath. Pol. cf. ch. 87 n.). Of these the Panathenaea was far the most important. kateu/xetai. The herald in the assembly (cf. Thuc. vi. 32) used this regular form of prayer. e)gi/neto toio/nde. It is most unlikely that this arrangement was accidental (Stein) or that this weakening of the centre is a fiction designed to explain its defeat. No doubt it was intended to prevent outflanking, but it would seem probable that the centre was obstructed by plantations of olives and vines (cf. Corn. Nep. 5), and that Miltiades therefore decided to concentrate a decisive force on either wing where the country was open, and suitable for a charge of hoplites (Caspari, J. H. S. xxxi. 103). a)pei/qhsan, 'were let go like runners' (cf. vii. 122). dro/mw|. The thrice-repeated statement that the Athenians charged at the double (\u00a7\u00a7 2, 3) is not to be explained away as an inference from the festival of the Boedromia (A. Mommsen, Feste Athen. 176) or by making dro/mw| the opposite of ba/dhn (ix. 57. 1), 'quick' and 'slow' march. On the other hand, an orderly and effective charge after a mile's run in full armour would be beyond the power of any large body of soldiers, however well trained. The 'mile', however, is probably an inference from the distance between the Athenian position near Vrana and the place where they charged the Persians near the Soros. No doubt the advance was rapid, but only for the last 200 yards, when within bowshot, would the Attic hoplites charge at full speed. I have shown (C.Q. xiii (1919), pp. 40-2) . e)pe/feron (cf. viii. 10. 1 n. and the common use of to\\ ka/rta, i. 71. 2 = haud dubie): others would join it here with o)leqri/hn. i(/ppou toceuma/twn (ix. 49. 3). The existence at Athens of a class of i(ppei=s, and the alleged furnishing of two horsemen by each naucrary, might seem to prove that Athens possessed cavalry. But Helbig has shown (Les *(ippei=s Ath\u00e9niens, p. 191 f.) from vases, &c., that these knights were, at least till 478 B. C., equipped not as true cavalry but as mounted infantry. Hence Athens depended on Thessalian horse in 510 B. C. (v. 63), and in 490 B. C. had certainly no cavalry fit to meet the Persian (cf. also ix. 40, 68, 69). At Salamis (Plut. Them. 14; Aesch. Pers. 460) the Athenians had archers, and at Plataea (ix. 22. 1, 60. 3) a regular corps of bowmen. The barbarians' astonishment at the absence of these forces may fairly be held to imply the presence of archers on their side otherwise unmentioned. For the cavalry cf. App. XVIII, \u00a7 8. prw=toi a)ne/sxonto. The statement, taken literally, is an exaggeration, disproved by the conduct of the Greeks in resisting the conquest of Ionia (i. 169) and in the Ionic revolt (v. 2, 102, 110, 113; vi. 28). Yet the fear of the Mede 775), and the first occasion on which the Greeks won a clear victory in the open field might well be described by an Athenian as the first occasion on which Greeks dared to face the Mede (cf. Introd. \u00a7 32 (2)). The Persians had borrowed the Medic dress (cf. i. 135; vii. 62). *pe/rsai kai\\ *sa/kai. The centre appears to have been the regular post of the best troops in Persian as in Turkish armies (cf. Arrian, Anab. ii. 8. 11; Xen. Anab. i. 8. 21-3), though not at Plataea (ix. 31). The Sacae or Amyrgian Scyths (iii. 93. 3; vii. 64. 2 nn.) were among the troops selected by Mardonius (viii. 113. 2). The imperfects used throughout this chapter are not only graphic, but show that the actions recorded are continuous or incomplete. In the picture of Marathon in the Stoa Poikile there were figures of Miltiades cheering on his men with extended hand (Aeschin. c. Ctes. iii. 186; Corn. Nep. Milt. 6), of Callimachus (Paus. i. 15. 3, with Frazer), of Cynegirus (Plin. N. H. xxxv, \u00a7 57), and apparently of his brother Aeschylus (Paus. i. 21. 2), who is said to have caused the fact to be recorded on his tomb as his greatest distinction. There were also figures of Datis and Artaphrenes (Plin. l. c.) and of Epizelus (117 n.). For the scenes depicted and for their relation to H.'s account cf. App. XVIII. 1. The historian's simple and straightforward account of Cynegirus' bravery contrasts most favourably with the tasteless exaggeration of later romancers, e. g. Justin, ii. 9. e)canakrousa/menoi, 'pushing off to the open sea.' Cf. e)cana/gesqai. A force that was hurrying round Sunium would not waste time in picking up prisoners. Grundy (p. 191) reasonably suggests that the Persian fleet was divided, the first section sailing direct to Phalerum, the second following after picking up the prisoners (cf. App. XVIII, \u00a7 7 f.). a)nade/cai: as a signal (cf. vii. 128. 2; Xen. Hell. ii. 1. 27) whose meaning had been agreed upon beforehand. For the time and meaning of the signal cf. App. XVIII, \u00a7 8. On the Heracleum cf. v. 63. 4 n. For a similar coincidence cf. ix. 101. The distance from Marathon to Athens (twenty-five miles by the modern road, twenty-two by Kephisia and the hills) is more than an army could march after a pitched battle, nor could the Athenians leave Marathon before they were certain of the intentions of the enemy. But the voyage round Sunium (seventy miles) would take longer. Hence both march and voyage, placed by Plutarch (Arist. 5) on the same day as the battle, should probably be assigned to the following day. If the Athenians really by a heroic effort marched back on the actual day of battle, it must have been to meet a detachment carried by a flying squadron which set sail before the battle (J. H. S. xxxi. 104, and App. XVIII, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9). to/te: until Themistocles made the triple harbour of Piraeus the port and arsenal of Athens. Even if he began this work in 493 B. C. (vii. 143. 1 n.; Thuc. i. 93), it would not be finished in 490. The number of the slain (as of captured ships, ch. 115) is probably trustworthy. The names of the Athenians would be recorded on the stelae which once adorned the great mound (Soros) over the tomb of the fallen heroes (Paus. i. 32. 3). That the Soros is the grave of the victors has been proved by recent excavations (Frazer, ii. 433-4). The barbarian dead may well have been counted on the field. The moderation of the estimate contrasts most favourably with later exaggerations\u2014the 200,000 of the inscription in the Stoa Poikile (Suidas), 300,000 of Pausanias (iv. 25. 5), or the innumerable multitude of Xenophon (Anab. iii. 2. 12) and Plutarch (de Malign. 26; 862 B). It is noticeable that H. gives no figures for the total number engaged on either side. Both Justin (ii. 9) and Nepos (Milt. 5) give 1,000 Plataeans, a good round exaggeration (ix. 28. 6 n.); but the former puts the Athenians at 10,000, the latter at 9,000 (cf. Paus. iv. 25. 5; x. 20. 2). These numbers are probably derived from Ephorus, and rest on a calculation of 1,000 men to a tribe. Yet they may well be near the truth, allowing for the total omission of light-armed troops. On the other hand, even the lowest ancient estimate of the Persians\u2014200,000 foot (of whom only 100,000 fought in the battle) and 10,000 horse (Nep. Milt. 4, 5\u2014is greatly exaggerated, not to speak of the 500,000 of Plato (Menex. 240 A) and Lysias (Epitaph. 21), or the 600,000 of Justin (ii. 9). Modern estimates rest on conjecture or on the number of the Persian ships (vi. 95 n.), an insecure foundation. Duncker's 60,000 is an outside estimate; perhaps 40,000 would be nearer the mark. qw=ma: Epizelus was depicted in the Stoa Poikile (Aelian, N. H. vii. 38). Blindness following on a vision is not in itself incredible (Acts ix. 1-9). But the vision is recorded with some doubt by H. It is strange that he, unlike Pausanias (i. 15), puts the supernatural aid on the side of the Persians, not of the Greeks. Cf. also App. XVIII, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3. The return of the Persians to Asia, and the arrival of the Spartans. According to Ctesias (Pers. 18, p. 69), Datis fell at Marathon. *muko/nw|: a little east of Delos. *dh/lion is more nearly opposite Eretria than Chalcis. For the temple cf. Thuc. iv. 76, 89 f.

His description suggests a visit, though the phrase me/xri e)me/o (\u00a7 4) does not affirm it (cf. 16 (4)). Strabo (747) places Eretrians in Gordyene on the upper Tigris, but H. is supported by the epigram of Plato, of dependents on a crown domain. trifasi/as o(dou/s. The second receiver had three outlets by which the different elements in the petroleum were separated. For the khlwnhi/on cf. i. 193, 1 n. th\\n a)rxai/hn glw=ssan. Diodorus (xvii. 119) says that some Boeotians, settled by Xerxes beyond the Tigris, still spoke their mother-tongue when Alexander came there. According to Plato (Laws 698 E; cf. Menex. 240 C) the Spartans came the day after the battle, and H. implies that they arrived before the burial of the Persian dead. Isocrates (Paneg. 87) allows three days and nights for the march of 1,200 stades, but even so the feat is wonderful (cf. 106). The shield-signal. Defence of the Alcmaeonids. H.'s attempt to prove Alcmaeonid hatred of the barbarian and of the tyrant is illogical and unconvincing. Even here (125) he relates their friendship with Croesus, the first barbarian who enslaved Greeks (i. 6. 2), and with Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sicyon (126 f.), and he conveniently forgets their alliance with Pisistratus (i. 60; Plut. Mor. 863 B) (Macan); cf. Plut. Mor. 862-3 and App. XVIII, \u00a7 6. The house of Callias was one of the richest and noblest in Athens. Plutarch (Mor. 863) attacks H. for dragging in the story to please Hipponicus, the head of the house in H.'s time, but the critic seems to have confused two relatives of the same name. u(po\\ tou= dhmosi/ou (sc.dou/lou): the public slave acting as auctioneer.

The Alcmaeonidae were in exile not throughout the tyranny, but from the second restoration of Pisistratus till the expulsion of his sons.

H.'s assertion is discredited by the position held at the time by Miltiades, the head of the rival house of Philaids, by the ostracism of Megacles in 487 B. C., and by the ode of Pindar (Pyth. vii); cf. further App. (Perserkriege 60 f. and Wilamowitz, A. and A. ii. 85) consider the shield-signal an invention of the excited imagination of the returning Athenian hoplites, but it is one of the incidents most positively attested. Nor is it victorious but vanquished armies which imagine treason in this way. For a better explanation cf. App. XVIII, \u00a7 8. Tales of the Alcmaeonid house. Of Croesus and Alcmaeon (125). Of the wooing of Agariste (126-30). H. again insists on the eminence of the Alcmaeonids (cf. v. 62. 2 n.). Megacles, father of Alcmaeon, was archon at the time of the Cylonian massacre (? 632 B. C.) (cf. v. 71 n.). That Alcmaeon was the founder of the family's great wealth is suggested by the name Alcmaeonid, and by the story here given, which is obviously a comic version of the enrichment of the family by the Lydian king or by successful trade with Sardis (Meyer, i,1 \u00a7 488). As is usual in such stories (cf. i. 29. 1; vi. 127. 3 n.), the chronology is confused and erroneous. Croesus reigned in Lydia circ. 560-546 B. C. (or five years later, Busolt, ii. 458-60), and his embassy to Delphi is not likely to have been earlier than 556-555 (Marmor Parium); but Alcmaeon appears to have been general in the Sacred war with Cirrha (circ. 595-586 B. C., Plut. Sol. 11), and circ. 550 B. C. has a grand-daughter old enough to be married to Pisistratus. The marriage of Megacles and Agariste (inf.) must therefore be placed before 565, probably 572 B. C. (cf. 126. 2), and the connexion of Alcmaeon with the Lydian king a generation earlier (inf.). It is, however, mis-spent ingenuity to transfer the services of Alcmaeon to the embassy sent to Delphi by Alyattes (i. 19. 25), and ascribe the wealth of the Alcmaeonids to the gratitude of that king. These anecdotes disregard chronology, nor has H. a fixed scheme for the sixth century (cf. App. XIV. 6 and Abbott, Exc. xi to Bk. V). Mahaffy (Soc. Greece, p. 158) contrasts the under-bred sharpness of the Greek and the courteous generosity of Olympic victory of the house when Pindar wrote Pyth. vii. 14. (490 or 486 B. C.). It seems to belong to Ol. 47 (592 B. C.). Aristotle, ? Pol. v. 12, 1315 b 11 f.; Plut. Mor. 553 B, speak as if the tyranny was held only by Orthagoras (Andreas) and his sons. But as it lasted a century (Ar. l. c., Diod. viii. fr. 24 = Ephorus) the genealogy here given seems preferable. (See note, p. 415.) Myron II made himself hated by his oppressive rule; after a rule of seven years he was slain by his brothers, and succeeded by the younger (? Ephorus) of them, Cleisthenes, who reigned for thirty-one years in prosperity (Nic. Dam. Fr. 61, F. H. G. iii. 394). Grote (iii. 38 n.) suggests that the tale is an imitation of the Epic 'Wooing of Helen', and Stein that it comes from an ode of Pindar (cf. also ch. 130. 1 n.). The fact of the wedding of the daughter and heiress (cf. Busolt, i. 666) of Cleisthenes is doubtless historical, the details are obviously fictitious. *)olumpi/wn: perhaps Ol. 52 = 572 B. C. *)itali/hs: cf. v. 43 n. ei)=s a)nh/r intensifies the superlative; cf. Aesch. Pers. 327. Anecdotes of the luxury of Smindyrides are given (from Timaeus) by Athenaeus, p. 273 b c, 541 b. He is said not to have seen the sun rise or set for twenty years, and to have been attended by 1,000 fowlers and 1,000 cooks. According to Seneca (de Ir. ii. 25) he complained of crumpled rose-leaves on his couch, and declared that to see a man hard at work in the field made him feel tired. *siri/ths: on Siris see viii. 62. 2 n. *tito/rmou. In Aelian, V. H. xii. 22, Titormus is said to have conquered Milo in a trial of strength, a story which would bring his date down to circ. 520 B. C. In such stories anachronisms are common (cf. I. vi. 27. 2, 125 n., 291 n.). *lewkh/dhs: identified by M\u00fcller with Lakedas, an effeminate king of Argos, twelfth in descent from Temenus (Paus. ii. 19. 2). Lehmann supposes H. (Hermes, xxxv. 648 f.; Klio ii. 336; cf. v. n.). *fei/dwnos. The date here assigned to Pheidon, viz. the age of Cleisthenes (circ. (i. 282; Rh. Mus. xlv. 595) and Trieber, and supported by the statement that he expelled the Elean Agonothetae, apparently after 572 B. C. (cf. Busolt, i. 604 and 612), can hardly be maintained. If, indeed, Pheidon first coined money (Ephorus in Strabo 358, Marm. Par.) in Greece proper, he would belong to the seventh century according to the numismatists, but the statement is an unhistorical amplification of H. (ta\\ me/tra) and inconsistent with the dates explicitly or implicitly assigned to Pheidon by Ephorus and the Parian marble. On the other hand, Ephorus making Pheidon the tenth descendant of Temenus (Strab. l. c.; cf. Paus. ii. 19. 2) would appear to place him circ. 800-770 B. C. (Busolt, i. 613), or a generation later (Abbott, Exc. vi to Bk. VI). The yet earlier dates for Pheidon seem due to his connexion with the royal line of Macedon. Caranus, the founder of the dynasty (unknown till the fourth century), is declared to be brother of Pheidon, and seventh in descent from Temenus (Theopomp. Fr. 30, F. H. G. i. 283), and eleventh from Heracles. This made the Macedonian dynasty older than the Median, then believed to have succeeded the Assyrian in 884 (Ctesias), and placed Pheidon in the same generation as Lycurgus, circ. 900-870 (Marm. Par. 894 B. C.). Finally, when Lycurgus, on account of the disk of Iphitus, was brought down to the first Olympiad (776 B. C.), Caranus and Pheidon too were moved down. Pheidon's accession was fixed in 798 (Jerome; cf. Eusebius and Syncellus), and his Olympiad (the 8th) fifty years later, as the crown and consummation of a long and prosperous reign (748 B. C.) (Paus. vi. 22. 2). This date is accepted by Grote (ii. 315), Duncker (ii. 67), Holm (i. 215), and Abbott (l. c.). Pausanias, however, makes Pheidon celebrate the Olympia in conjunction with the men of Pisa. Now Strabo (355) distinctly places the presidency of the Pisatans after the 26th Olympiad, though quite aware of Ephorus' views on Pheidon (p. 358). Africanus also knows no break in the official (Elean) list of Olympiads till the 28th, which was held by the Pisatans. Hence Falconer and Weissenborn would emend the text of Pausanias (28th for 8th), and so date Pheidon in 668 B. C. Whether the emendation be justifiable or not, the date is most suitable (Curtius, Busolt, l. c., Macan, Bury, p. 860). Pheidon would thus be placed between the two Messenian wars at the time of the great Argive victory over the Spartans at Hysiae (Paus. ii. 24. 7). This date would also make it possible for him to have spread abroad the use of the *feidw/neia me/tra (used at Athens before Solon, Ath. Pol. ch. 10), or rather perhaps of the Aeginetan system of weights and measures. Lastly, the anachronism here is more intelligible if the 28th Olympiad be accepted. In a legend Solon and Croesus may well meet, but hardly Croesus and Lycurgus. Wells (op. cit. pp. 54-62) argues strongly for placing Pheidon in the eighth century B. C. rather than in the seventh, and P. Gardner (op. cit. pp. 111-13) inclines to the earlier date. In any case the anti-Dorian and anti-Argive policy of Cleisthenes (cf. v. 67) makes the presence of a son or descendant of the Dorian despot of Argos among the suitors of Agariste improbable. It is noticeable that the list of suitors contains no representative of the Samos, Chalcis, Croton, Corinth league, for which cf. v. 99 n. *)azh/n: i. e. of Azania, a district comprising Western and North Western Arcadia.

The application of athletic tests is very characteristic of Greek ideas. Hippocleides, son of Tisander, was, according to the chronicler Pherecydes, descended from the Aeantid Philaus (cf. Marc. Thuc. 3), whose mother Lysidice was a descendant of Caeneus, from whom the Cypselids traced their line (v. 92 b). It is also probable that Hippocleides is the brother of the Philaid Cypselus (ch. 34. 1), whose name may point to some more recent intermarriage between the Philaids and Cypselids, or to an attempt to revive the legendary connexion. th=s katakli/sios, 'the marriage feast.' e)s to\\ me/son: stories told 'for all to hear.'

It is tempting to see in this exaltation of Pericles the key to H.'s defence and glorification of the Alcmaeonids, and to suppose that this excursus (ch. 121-31), or at least the story of the wedding (126-31), was inserted in the history (circ. 432-0 B. C.) when the ancient curse on the Alcmaeonids was turned into a weapon against Pericles. The male line of the Alcmaeonids disappeared; Pericles and Alcibiades were connected with the family on the female side. Miltiades' expedition against Paros.

H.'s account of the Parian expedition shows his characteristic defects (Introd. \u00a7 32): (1) the ascription of great events to petty personal motives (ch. 133, the rancour of Miltiades); (2) the preference for a version of the tale (the Parian) attributing the event to divine interference. Some critics (e.g. Macan, App. XI) have therefore preferred the rationalizing version of Ephorus (fr. 107, F. H. G. i. Steph. Byz. s. v.*pa/ros; cf. this version there are good points. For an isolated attack on Paros is substituted a commission to punish the islands which had assisted the barbarian, and the subjugation of several (Nepos, vi expugnavit'). Such an attempt to establish Athenian dominion in the Cyclades, the dream of Pisistratus (cf. App. XVI. 8), is in itself probable. Yet even the motive may be an inference from the pretext given in H. (133. 1), just as the supposed signal fire of Datis on Myconos (Nepos' in continenti is a physical impossibility) is apparently an inference from Datis' stay at Myconos (ch. 118). The only independent element in Ephorus (E. Meyer, F. i. 19) appears to be the proverbial phrase a)naparia/zein, the explanation of which is the kernel of his narrative. But the explanation is untrustworthy. Miltiades' expedition can hardly have taken place before the spring of 489 B. C. [there is an interval after Marathon (autumn 490) during which Miltiades enjoyed increased fame (ch. 132)], and in 489 B. C. Datis cannot well have been even thought to be lingering in the neighbourhood of Myconos. Lastly, the precise duration of the expedition given by H. (135), twenty-six days, looks like genuine tradition, and contrasts favourably with the vague polu\\n xro/non of Ephorus. Probably Ephorus, like modern critics, was offended by the shortcomings of H. and rationalized the traditional story. I have argued in detail (J. H. S. xxxix (1919), pp. 58-61) that the account in Nepos (Ephorus) of the Parian expedition and the trial of Miltiades is untrustworthy. kinh/sonta. Probably Miltiades was to steal a sacred image, like the Palladium, on which the safety of the state depended. H. inserts in an account ascribed to all Greeks, but presumably Athenian, a Parian story heard perhaps on the spot; cf. kolwno/s, and ai(masi/h, a dry wall (cf. i. 180 n.), defining the e(/rkos. The Athenian account, with its unfavourable view of Miltiades' motives and conduct, is probably Alcmaeonid, derived perhaps from the speech made by Xanthippus in prosecuting Miltiades (ch. 136). a)/rrhta. For secret rites confined to women cf. v. 82, 83 nn. dei=n (cf. ii. 161. 3). To H. this is the general nemesis of too great success and fame; by the time of Pausanias (iii. 12. 7) a special transgression has been discovered, the proposal to throw the heralds of Darius into the Barathron, for which cause the wrath of Talthybius fell on Miltiades. This tradition must have been unknown to H. (cf. vii. 133. 2), and like the story in Plato (Gorgias 516 E) that Miltiades himself only escaped being cast into the Barathron through the interference of the Prytanis, seems a later accretion designed to heighten the effect. fanh=nai: i. e. an apparition was sent to Miltiades in the shape of Timo (Stein); cf. iv. 15. 2; vii. 16. g 1 and 3; viii. 37. 2; ix. 100, and fa/sma, vi. 69. 1, 117. 3. Xanthippus, father of Pericles (cf. ch. 131. 2). The enmity still existed in the next generation between Pericles and Cimon. The charge was clearly a)pathse/ws tou= dh/mou, a form of prodosi/a. But treason was not exactly defined till the archonship of Euclides, 403 B. C. (Nepos, Milt. 7). Ephorus makes the treason consist in taking bribes from the Persian, for in his account there is no deceiving of the people. The procedure was no doubt by ei)saggeli/a (u(po\\ to\\n dh=mon) before the mortification following a sprain or bruise seems improbable. In the account of Nepos (Milt. 7) Miltiades had been wounded in the siege. oi( fi/loi: Nepos (l. c.) names his brother Stesagoras (al. Tisagoras), but he was long dead; cf. ch. 38. prosgenome/nou. At least in an a)gw\\n timhto/s there were two questions decided by separate votes: (1) the guilt of the accused, (2) the amount of the penalty. Miltiades was found guilty on the charge of deceiving the people, but on the second point the people was favourable to him. The penalty of death proposed by Xanthippus was reduced to a fine of fifty talents, which was probably proposed by his friends. They would suggest a large sum so as to secure the rejection of the death-penalty (contrast the case of Socrates). The suggestion of Nepos (Ephorus) that fifty talents was the cost of the expedition is a mere guess. The exaggerations of later writers, e.g. that Miltiades died in prison (Nepos, Milt. 7; Diod. x. 30; Plut. Cim. 4), and that Cimon was imprisoned, are baseless fictions (Meyer, F. ii. 25 f.) unknown to H. The Pelasgi in Attica and in Lemnos. Miltiades secures Lemnos for Athens. Stein approves the suggestion of E. Meyer (F. i. 14 f.) that the conquest of Lemnos and Imbros was not the work of the great Miltiades, but of his namesake and predecessor, the son of Cypselus (cf. vi. 34 f.), oekist of the Chersonese. If so, he acted as the agent of Pisistratus (cf. vi. 37) in seizing Lemnos and expelling the Pelasgi. This would fit in with the prediction (ch. 140. 1), which regards the conqueror of Lemnos as representing Athens. Meyer urges that there was no time for the conquest and Hellenizing (cf. viii. 11) of the island during the troubled period of the Ionic revolt, so that he would in any case date the settlement of Attic cleruchs there, even if ascribed to Miltiades II, to the period of Pisistratid rule, before the Persian conquest of the islands (v. 27). But H. distinctly says that up to that time the Pelasgi still dwelt there (v. 26 a)mfote/ras e)/ti to/te u(po\\ *pelasgw=n oi)keome/nas). It seems therefore better to accept the solution of Busolt (ii. 531; iii. 415) that the Pelasgi, already weakened by the Persian conquest, were expelled by Miltiades after 500, who settled the island as tyrant of the Chersonese, and that the Attic cleruchy in Lemnos (Thuc. vii. 57; C. I. A. i. 443, 444) is to be connected with the reduction of the tribute circ. 447 B. C. Previously, as in the Chersonese, there had been settlers from Attica, not a formal Attic colony. The rest of the chapter is a long parenthesis, to explain ei)/te dikai/ws ei)/te a)di/kws: then the subject *pelasgoi/, is resumed loosely 138. 1. *(ekatai=os a)di/kws. Hecataeus used the expression \"unjustly\" in his ch. 53. 2; on Hecataeus cf. Introd. \u00a7 20. On the Pelasgi cf. App. XV. 5. E. Meyer holds that there was no old Attic tradition about the Pelasgi, the story given here being a mere reply to Hecataeus (F. i. 8 f.). tou= tei/xeos. Probably the early tradition here followed made the 'Pelasgic' wall run right round the Acropolis (D'Ooge, p. 21). On the more special sense of Pelasgicon cf. v. 64 n. *)ennea/krounos. The name is here an anachronism, since only in the days of the tyrants was the spring Callirhoe walled in and renamed 'Nine-Spouts' (Thuc. ii. 15. 5). The position of CallirhoeEnneacrunus is much disputed. That there was a Callirhoe on the Ilissus is clear; the Acropolis, near the (later) Olympieium, would suit this passage, since it should be outside the old city and towards Hymettus. The ordinary interpretation of Thucydides (ii. 15. 5) favours the same position. But Pausanias (i. 14. 1) mentions an Enneacrunus, apparently in the Agora, somewhere near the Pnyx and the Areopagus. Most topographers believe in a break in the narrative of Pausanias (Leake, Curtius) or a mistaken identification of Enneacrunus on his part (Frazer, ii. 112 f., v. 485 f.; Gardner, Athens, 28 f., 535 f.). But D\u00f6rpfeld (for whose views cf. Harrison's Primitive Athens) interprets the older authors, and especially Thucydides, in conformity with the natural meaning of Pausanias, and believes he has found the true Callirhoe-Enneacrunus in a cistern, conduit, and other water-works hewn in the rock below the Pnyx (Primitive Athens, 111-36 and 153 f.). tou=ton to\\n xro/non. The Pelasgians are said by Strabo (401) to have been driven from Boeotia to Attica by the Boeotian immigration, i. e. some two generations after the Trojan war (Thuc. i. 12; cf. vii. 176. 4). The Pelasgian sojourn in Attica would thus be dated circ. 1100-1000 B. C. oi)ke/tas. H. is not thinking of the fancied golden age when there were no slaves (Athen. 263, 267), but contrasting primitive simplicity (cf. viii. 137) with the large households of later days. There were slaves even in Homeric days, but in the more backward parts of Greece, Phocis, and Locris, there were but few even as late as the time of Aristotle (Timaeus, fr. 67, F. H. G. i. 207; Athen. 264, 272). a)lla/. Placia and Scylace on the Propontis (i. 57. 2), Samothrace (ii. 57. 3), Imbros (v. 26), and perhaps near Creston (i. 57. 1) and at Antandrus (vii. 42. 1). Cf. Myres, J. H. S. xxvii. 191 f. The story may be a reminiscence of primitive customs, marriage by capture and exogamy, on which see McLennan, Studies in Ancient History (ch. vii, f.), and Westermarck (ch. xiv), and (especially on exogamy) Frazer, Totemism and Exogamy (vol. iv). Brauron lay on the east coast of Attica, between Prasiae and Marathon, probably at the modern Vraona (Frazer, Paus. ii. 446). Attic legend (Eurip. Iph. in 1435 f.) identified Brauronian Artemis Tauric Artemis brought by Orestes (but cf. Paus. iii. 16. 7, as well as i. 23. 7, 33. 1, and Harrison, Ancient Athens, p. 395 f.). The implied dependence of Brauron on Athens, and possibly the festival itself, belong to a later date than the legendary expulsion of the Pelasgi. a)/rxein. The legend invented to justify Athenian dominion over Lemnos treats these Attic boys as its natural lords and masters; cf. the tale of Cyrus i. 114. *qo/anti. The ordinary legend was that King Thoas was concealed by his daughter Hypsipyle, but afterwards discovered and killed by the other women (Apollodor. i. 9. 17; iii. 6. 4). H. may be only summarizing, not differing from this account. Cf. Aesch. the curse of fruitlessness cf. iii. 65. 7, v. 82. 1, ix. 93. 3; and for similar visitations i. 167. 1; iv. 151. 1. e)canu/sh|: abs. to 'arrive at'. Cf. vii. 183. 3, and katanu/sas, ch. 140. 1. pollo/n: far, about 140 miles. to/te: at least five hundred years before the Ionian revolt by the ordinary computation; cf. 137. 3 n. katesthko/twn: during the prevalence of the Etesian winds, which blow from the north-east during July, August, and September. Hephaestia and Myrina are the two towns of the islands. The former in the north-east (Palaeopoli), though not very strong for defence, was well situated for commerce (Tozer, I. Aeg. p. 268); the latter (Kastro) in the south-west occupies a striking position which marks it out as the natural capital (ib. p. 246). The former paid twice as much tribute as Myrina to Athens in 444 B. C. and later. The capture of Lemnos forms an admirable finale, making a pause in the history before the great war, and recalling the great services of the hero Miltiades instead of closing the book with his miserable death. BOOK VII Further preparations against Greece. Dispute about the succession to the Persian throne. Death of Darius. There is an obvious break between the sixth and seventh books. Indeed, it is probable that the story of the Invasion of Xerxes was written before the rest of the history (cf. Introd. \u00a7 12). th\\n e)s *sa/rdis e)sbolh/n. For the 'attack on Sardis' cf. 8. b 3 and especially v. 99 f. kata\\ po/lis. H. writes like a Greek here, though at times (e.g. 8. g 3) he remembers that there are tribes as well as cities in the East. No real attempt was made to 'urbanize' the interior of Asia before Alexander. pollw=| ple/w. Nothing is said in iii. 89f. of Persian subjects furnishing contingents, but no doubt this had been part of Darius' organization. Cf. App. VI. 8. ne/as: war-ships, and especially triremes (cf. viii. 1, 2). ploi=a: transports, to carry horses (i(ppagwga/, cf. 21. 2, 97) and provisions (sitagwga/, cf. 186. 1, 191. 1). e)pi\\ tri/a e)/tea. For the chronology cf. vii. 20 n. no/mon. There is no hint of any such rule or law, when Cambyses invaded Egypt (ii. 1; iii. 1), Darius Scythia (iv. 1. 83), or Xerxes Greece, though Xerxes clearly made his uncle Artabanus viceroy during his absence (ch. 52). On the other hand, Cyrus is said to have named Cambyses as his successor before his last expedition (i. 208). The fact that the monuments call Cambyses 'king of Babylon' in the lifetime of Cyrus (E. Meyer, F. ii. 470-2) cannot be used as an argument, as Babylon was in a special position till the time of Xerxes (i. 183 n.). Perhaps the question arose because Darius was old; on this ground Artaxerxes Mnemon appointed a successor to avoid strife (Plut. Artax. 26): or possibly Plutarch (Mor. 488) and Justin (ii. 10), who call the eldest son Ariamenes, are right in saying that the dispute arose after the death of Darius, and was decided by the intervention of one of his brothers, Artabanus or Artaphrenes. Gobryas was one of the seven (iii. 70). For the family of Darius cf. iii. 88 n.; vii. 11. kata\\ tw)uto/, 'at the same time' (i. e. 487-486 B. C.). Demaratus had gone into exile voluntarily (circ. 491 B. C.); cf. vi. 67-70. Nothing is known otherwise of this alleged Spartan custom. H. himself attaches no weight to this supposed intervention of Demaratus, whose importance he as a rule exaggerates. The true reason doubtless was the influence of Atossa (\u00a7 4) as daughter of Cyrus and chief wife of Darius. She held the position filled by Amestris under Xerxes (ix. 109 f.), and by Parysatis under Darius Nothus. Cf. the influence of Bathsheba with David, 1 Kings i. Darius died in the autumn of 486 B. C. and had reigned thirty-six years (Manetho, fr. 68, 69, F. H. G. ii. 595). Ctesias' statement (Pers. 19, p. 69) that he reigned only thirty-one years is worthless. Weissbach, Z. D. M. G. (1901), p. 195 f., esp. 220, and (1908) 629-47, shows that, the death of Artaxerxes being placed in 425-424 (Thuc. iv. 50), his reign being at least forty years and ten months in length, must have begun in 465, and that Xerxes, since he reigned over twenty years (Ptolemaic Canon), must have come to the throne in 486. Counsellors who urged Xerxes to war. Mardonius, the Aleuadae, the Pisistratidae, and Onomacritus. a)nexw/rhse: like a)nabai/nein (i. 109. 4; vii. 205. 1), a)nalamba/nein (vii. 154. 1), of regular succession by an heir, opposed to perixwre/ein, perielqei=n (i. 7. 1 n.), when a kingdom passes into strange hands. 8. g 3, 16. a 1, 103.4; viii. 68. g, 109. 3; and in general, Introduction, 18. a)ll' ei) prh/ssois.

Goodwin (\u00a7 723) regards these as optatives in a wish with ei), which was probably in origin a protasis, with apodosis timwro/s: better construed 'demanding vengeance' helped him,' for which cf. v. 65. 1; vii. 6. 1. de/ndrea. The Persians took great pride in the cultivation of fruittrees and gardens. Cf. Vendidad, iii, \u00a7 4, l. 12: 'Which is the third place where the Earth feels most happy.' Ahuramazda answered, 'It is the place where one of the faithful cultivates most corn, grass, and fruit'; and iii, \u00a7 23, l. 76. So Xerxes pays great honour to a splendid plane-tree (ch. 31), and Darius commends his servant Gadatas for acclimatizing crops and fruit-trees in lower Asia (Hicks, 20). Kings and satraps rivalled each other in laying out gardens and orchards (Xen. Oecon. 4). *)aleua/dai. This famous and powerful family, which claimed descent from a mythical king of Thessaly, Aleuas (ch. 130. 3, ix. 58. 2; Pind. Pyth. x. 5), was connected with the house of Antiochus of Pharsalus (Theoc. xvi. 34f.) and with the Scopadae of Crannon (Ovid, Ibis 511f.). They do not seem to have been 'kings' of Thessaly, though the title is also used of other Thessalian dynasts (v. 63. 3 n.; Thuc. i. 111), but rather tagoi/ of Thessaly (a title first clearly used of Jason of Pherae, Xen. Hell. vi. 1; cf. ix. 1; Pind. Pyth. x. 70), and kings or dynasts of Larissa on the Peneius. Even in their own district their power seems to have been disputed by the democratic faction. Thorax (cf. Pind. Pyth. x. 64) with his brothers invites Xerxes to invade Greece (ix. 1), is the first to join him (vii. 172; Paus. vii. 10. 2), and actively supports the Persian (ix. 1. 58), whereas the people of Thessaly begged the Greeks to defend their land (vii. 172). The Aleuadae no doubt hoped with Persian aid to establish themselves as kings of Thessaly; though foiled in this, they escaped complete subjection to Sparta by bribing Leotychides (vi. 72; Paus. iii. 7. 9). They had probably been allied with the Pisistratidae when that family ruled Athens (v. 63. 94). prosore/gesqai (Stein), like protei/nesqai (v. 24. 4; vii. 161. 1), proi/sxesqai (i. 141. 1), to 'offer, promise', is middle rather than passive =proskei=sqai (L. & S.; Abicht), 'to be urgent with.' like Musaeus, 18. 34), and to the learned and skilled interpreters of ancient sayings and oracles (ch. 142. 3), whose advice in times of crisis had great weight (Thuc. ii. 8). Of the latter class was Onomacritus who collected and arranged a number of oracles currently ascribed to the mythical seer Musaeus, which with the similar collection ascribed to Orpheus were the chief specimens of this apocryphal literature. To him may be ascribed the Pisistratid collection of oracles (v. 90. 2; cf. Introd. \u00a7 24 (3)) and skill in their interpretation (v. 93. 2). He is said to have been commissioned by Pisistratus along with three colleagues to collect and arrange the scattered lays of Homer (Cramer, Anec. i. 6); if so, he must by now (485 B. C.) have been quite an old man. He had a bad reputation as a forger (\u00a7 3) and interpolator (Schol. Harl. Od. xi. 604); indeed, some writers treat the work of Musaeus as wholly or mainly a forgery (Clem. Alex. p. 397, Potter; Paus. i. 22. 7), while others regard it as a compilation from old materials (Plut. Mor. 407 B). In the Pisistratid family Hipparchus appears to have been specially the patron of poets, e.g. Anacreon and Simonides (Plato, Hipparch. 228 f.). *la/sos: a lyric and dithyrambic poet said to have been the teacher of Pindar and inventor of the cyclic chorus, and to have written a treatise on music. The *ne/ai (nh=soi), which lay off the east coast of Lemnos, were raised from the sea by volcanic eruptions (Plin. ii. \u00a7 202, Steph. Byz.), Mount Mosychlos, on the east coast of Lemnos, being active in ancient times. The prophecy was fulfilled, for that part of Lemnos is now submerged, while one of these small islands, Chryse (still existent in 72 B. C.; cf. App. Mith. 77), had disappeared even when Pausanias (viii. 33. 4) wrote. The 'sacred' volcanic isle which appeared (circ. 197 B. C.) between Thera and Planasia, was also the subject of an oracle (Plut. Mor. 399). a)fanizoi/ato: present, because that tense is usual in oracles; cf. ch. 140, 220. sfa/lma fe/ron seems to mean here (cf. viii. 137. 3) 'portending' misfortune, while in ix. 9. 2 it means 'bringing evil on'. th/n te e)/lasin e)chgeo/menos: rather 'expounding the course of the expedition' according to the oracle (cf. e)chghth/s, i. 78. 2) than advising or explaining, as in iii. 4. 3; vi. 135. 2. Suppression of the Egyptian revolt. From Egyptian sources we learn that a native king Chabbasch reigned more than one year, the death of an Apis occurring in his second year, and that some measures were taken to protect the mouths of the Nile against the Persian fleet (Macan). deute/rw| e)/tei+: i. e. in 484 B. C., probably in the spring. doulote/rhn. Darius had treated the Egyptians very well, building and repairing temples, re-establishing the decayed college of scribes at Sais (inscription of Uzahor, cf. iii. 16 n., Meyer, iii, \u00a7 101), completing the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea (ii. 158 nn.), and in general paying respect to the priesthood (ii. 110) and customs of Egypt. Henceforward little or no regard was paid to Egyptian prejudices; in Egypt as in Babylon the Persian king ceases to figure as a national king (i. 183 n.). *)axaime/nei+: cf. ch. 236. He was full brother of Xerxes (vii. 97), and fell at Papremis 459 B. C. (iii. 12. 4). *)ina/rws: for his revolt cf. iii. 15. 3. Persian Council. Speeches of Xerxes, Mardonius, and Artabanus. e)pi/klhton, 'specially summoned,' like the Athenian e)kklhsi/ai su/gklhtoi. Elsewhere it is used of the counsellors ( = su/mboulos summoned to advise the king or general (viii. 101. 1; ix. 42. 2); cf. select council (Liv. xxxv. 34; Polyb. xx. 1 and 10). Those summoned would include the seven councillors or princes (Ezra vii. 14, 15; Esther i. 14; cf. iii. 14. 5 n.), together with the principal officials, satraps, and generals (cf. ch. 8. d, 19. 2, 26. 2). The scene on the famous Darius vase at Naples (found at Canosa 1851) is an ideal representation of such a council, leading to strife between Asia and Hellas. In the upper row are figures of gods, Asia misled by Apate, Hellas defended by Pallas and Zeus, Artemis and Apollo. Below, the subjects of the Persian bring tribute, or express their obedience by kneeling before the king's treasurer. In the middle row Darius sits on a throne; behind him stands a young Persian guard, before him an older man in travelling garb standing on a plinth of gold (Ael. V. H. xii. 62) earnestly warns the king. Five councillors sit or stand round, two in Persian, three in Greek attire. There is no reason to identify this scene with the council described by H.; the king has the name Darius inscribed by him, the warning councillor has nothing to identify him with Artabanus, and half the councillors are in Greek dress. Cf. Baumeister, p. 408. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Demosth. \u00a7 41) quotes this speech of Xerxes as institute.' Cf. ii. 49. 1, 56. 3. For the thought cf. Thuc. v. 105. 2. qeo/s a)/gei. Since the phrase is fatalistic, and as a rule implies impending ruin, it is in the mouth of Xerxes ominous. Cf. Xen. Anab. vi. 3. 18; Soph.

Only small sections of the Indians (iii. 98, 101) and of the African Aethiopians (iii. 97) with the Amyrgian Sacae (cf. ch. 64. 2; iii. 93. 3) and the Eastern Ethiopians (iii. 94, vii. 70) were subjects of the Persian empire. Reliance on mere masses of men and abundance of gold is characteristically Persian. Cf. ch. 48, 103; cf. vi. 43 f., and especially vi. 45 n. H. seems to be putting his own ideas into the mouth of Mardonius (cf. ch. 10. e, 46, &c.). Polybius (xiii. 3) says that the ancients fought on the principles here described from a desire for honourable and decisive battle. Grundy (Thucydides, ch. ix) finds the explanation in the geographical character of Greece, and in the necessity of fighting in the plain to defend its corn-crop. So Pericles says of *)asi/hs and a(pa/sas both belong in sense to plh=qos and ne/as, but to avoid repetition and to preserve the balance of words are attached each to one only. Cf. Hom.

The Persians regarded all Asia as their own (i. 4. 4; ix. 116. 3), but the claim here made may be founded on a mythical descent (ch. 61. 2, 3) from Perseus and Andromeda (ch. 150. 2), daughter of Cepheus, brother of Ninus, who extended the sway of Assyria over Phrygia and Lydia (i. 7). The Persian king might claim to be the legitimate successor of the Assyrian. The dreams of Xerxes and Artabanus finally determine the king to make war. nukti/. To the Greek as to us night expresses doubt (iii. 40. 1), and throws the responsibility for the story on the Persians. The dream is modelled on that sent to Agamemnon (Il. ii. 66).

It would most readily occur to the mind of an Athenian, who had observed the sudden change in the fortunes of Xerxes after the taking of the Acropolis and the destruction of the olive sacred to Athena (viii. 55; cf. v. 82). The change indicated by the fading of the crown, the Magi prudently ignored. The chronology here implied for the ten years (cf. Thuc. i. 18 between Marathon and Salamis would seem to be the following: 490 B. C. (autumn). Marathon. 490 B. C. (winter)\u2014487 B. C. (spring).

H., our oldest authority, holds that this movement included both Teucrians and Mysians, and that they passed from Asia to Europe by the Bosporus, and conquered Thracians as far as the Peneius and the Adriatic. His grounds appear to be (cf. Stein): (1) The Paeonians regarded Teucrians from Troy as their ancestors (cf. v. 13. 2). (2) Paeonian and kindred races were settled in scattered groups from the Propontis to the Illyrian mountains, e.g. in North Thessaly, in the Pelagonian (i. e. Paeonian) Tripolis; cf. the local legends of Dyrrhachium and the Cestrini on the Adriatic (Appian, B. C. ii. 39; Paus. ii. 23. 6). (3) The Bithynians claimed to be Thracians driven from their homes on the Strymon by Teucrians (vii. 75) and Mysians. (4) A number of similar names are found on both sides the Hellespont (Strabo 590), e.g. in Thrace a river Arisbus, in Lesbos and the Troad towns called Arisba, at Troy a Scaean gate, in Thrace a Scaean fort and river. (5) In Homer Priam's allies extend from Western Asia Minor to the Axius. (6) The musical skill and orgiastic rites of Phrygia are attributed to the earliest Thracians. Strabo, in fact (470-1), completely identifies the two civilizations. But, as Macan points out, all of these (except (1), which is itself disputable) are consistent with a 'Mysian' migration from Thrace to Asia, while (2) and (3) distinctly favour the idea that the earlier habitat of the tribes in question was European. We may therefore prefer the later view (Strabo 295, 566), which represented the Mysians as immigrants from Thrace or Moesia. This is supported by H.'s statement (vii. 75) that this Teucro-Mysian movement drove the Bithynians from the Strymon to Asia, and by the earliest use of the word Mysian in Homer (Il. xiii. 5), where the race is placed in Thrace or Moesia. [In later passages (Il. ii. 858; x. 430) their habitat is doubtful, though presumably in Asia.] The tradition that the crossing was by the Bosporus is confirmed by the statement of Strabo (566) that it was named of old the Mysian Bosporus, and by the fact that this would be the natural crossingplace from Moesia to maritime Mysia near Cius (E. Meyer, Troas). Again, the Teucrians seem to have had no connexion with the Mysians before they met in the Troad, but are best derived from Cyprus (Meyer, i, \u00a7 491 n.). Finally, H. is led to date the migration before the Trojan war by the presence of Mysians in Homeric Thrace and their absence from the Troad. The rival theory naturally dated the movement into Mysia later, as Mysians and Teucrians are not found in the Troad in Homer. For a fuller discussion cf.

The use of the whip was repulsive to the free Greek. It is, however, well attested for the Assyrians (Layard. Nineveh and Babylon, 110-13), the Persians (ch. 56. 1, 223. 2; cf. 103. 4 and especially Xen. Anab. iii. 4, \u00a7 25), and the modern Turks. kath=kon: reaching right down to the sea; so of a cape, ch. 33, but of the vale of Tempe Sane on the Acte, which (with the five other small towns mentioned below, and Thuc. iv. 109; Strabo 330, fr. 33) belonged later to the Athenian confederacy, and is named on the Tributelists without any qualifying epithet; but H. (ch. 123) and Strabo (330, fr. 27) also mention a Sane on the western coast of Pallene. H. distinctly affirms both the completion (ch. 37) and the use of the canal (ch. 122); cf. Thuc. iv. 109. The ridicule cast on the assertion in antiquity (Juv. x. 174; Lucian, Dial. Mort. 20) is entirely undeserved, and the doubts whether it was ever completed (Stein, Wecklein) are unwarranted. Demetrius of Scepsis, indeed (Strabo 331, fr. 35), declared that after passing through ten stades of earth the canal must have been stopped by a bank of rock a stade broad. At present there are said to be 'about 200 yards in the middle where the ground bears no appearance of ever having been touched. . . . But it is probable that the central part was afterwards filled up to allow a more ready passage into and out of the peninsula' (Wolfe, ap. Mayor, Juvenal, x. 174). 'Captain Spratt (R. G. S., 1847) found distinct traces of the ancient cutting almost across the whole isthmus, only failing where the canal approached the sea, and somewhat indistinctly marked in the alluvial plain north of the hills (cf. also Leake, N. G. iii. 145; Hauvette, p. 291). The canal forms a line of ponds from two to eight feet deep and from sixty to ninety broad. It was cut through beds of tertiary sands and marls, being probably where it was deepest not more than sixty feet below the natural surface of the ground, which at its highest point rises only fifty-one feet above the sea-level' (Rawlinson). The work was not great but easy, hence Stein's comparison with the Corinth canal (cf. App. XVI, \u00a7 4), where there is a mile of rock and the land rises 255 feet above the sea, is misleading. The distance across, 2,500 yards, agrees nearly with the 'twelve stades' of H., but its breadth may have been less than he implies (ch. 24). Demetrius gives 100 feet, which agrees better with the modern remains (cf. sup.). With the making of the canal may be connected the hoard of 300 Darics found in the neighbourhood before 1840 (Borell, Num. Chron. vi. 153). (See note, p. 415.) e)pi\\ ba/qrwn: rather steps or stages in the side of the canal than ladders. The ascription to the expert Phoenicians (cf. vi. 47) alone of the only possible way of making the canal shows that H. is here repeating a popular story (Hauvette, p. 291; Macan, ii. 147). ka/tw For the canal of Darius cf. ii. 158. 1 n. Xerxes may no doubt have wished to rival his father (ch. 8 a), but that his motive was pride is avowedly a suggestion of H. Indeed, the importance attached to the canal seems due to the historian. Aeschylus never mentions it, though he refers repeatedly to the Hellespont Bridge (Pers. 69 f., 130, 723, 745). Only later did the turning of land into sea as well as sea into land by Xerxes become a rhetorical commonplace (Juv. x. 173; Mayor, ad loc.). But in the opinion of Leake (l. c., quoted in full by Grote, Abridgement, p. 170) Xerxes was perfectly justified in cutting this canal as well from the security which it afforded his fleet (cf. ch. 22. 1) as from the facility of the work and the advantages of the ground, which seems made expressly to tempt such an undertaking. The canal (if renewed) would be useful for the navigation of the Aegean, since there are between the Hellespont and Salonica no harbours protected against the South-West wind (Scirocco), while if the canal were available, ships might shelter from it in the bay of Acanthus, and from the North wind in the Singitic gulf (Anderson, Papers of Univ. Coll., Sheffield, 1897, p. 221). For such transportation cf. the famous *di/olkos at Corinth, traces of which still remain (Thuc. iii. 15, viii. 7 and 8; Polyb. iv. 19, v. 101), and the similar transport at Leucas (Thuc. iii. 81, iv. 8) and Tarentum (Polyb. viii. 36). But the operation would have taken time and might have been difficult for so vast a fleet. *strumo/na: cf. ch. 114. o(/pla: cables (ch. 36. 1. 3; ix. 115, 121). bu/blina: cf. ii. 92. 5 n. leukoli/nou: parallel to bu/blina (cf. ch. 34); the adjective leukoli/nhs is first used 349 B.

Now Serrhium is near Doriscus (Liv. xxxi. 16) and Cape Serrhium (ch. 59. 2) = Cape Makri, but Tyrodiza belongs to the Hellespontine not the Thracian district, and such a situation is more in accordance with its dependence on Perinthus, hence Stein seems right in identifying it with *teiri/stasis, placed by Scylax (68), just after Leuce Acte, and in interpreting the common Thracian termination diza equivalent to stasis. At Doriscus (ch. 58), Eion 113), and Therma (121) the army halted. e)pi\\ *strumo/ni: added to distinguish this Eion (cf. viii. 118. 1; Thuc. i. *mendai/wn a)poiki/a (Thuc. iv. 7), apparently Chalcidice on the Thermaic gulf. The march from Critalla to Sardis. The riches of Pythius the Lydian. a(/pas. Clearly the contingents from Western Asia Minor would not join the king till he reached Sardis or Abydos, but H. insists on the muster at Critalla. Critalla, otherwise unknown, must have been at some great meeting-place of roads in Eastern Asia Minor. Macan (ii. 128 f.) identifies it with Tyana, believing that Xerxes kept south of the Halys and the desert, along the route followed by the Roman road from Tyana to Iconium, and thence to Tyriaeum and Celaenae. But this route, whether in this form, or in that described by Strabo (663), seems to be no earlier than the fourth century. As Xerxes crossed the Halys (\u00a7 3), Critalla should be somewhere on the Royal road (cf. v. 52), perhaps at Caesarea Mazaca, and Xerxes must have followed the circuitous route of that road by Pteria, Ancyra, and Pessinus. He must then have turned south into the Maeander valley to avoid the rough and difficult route by Satala and the Hermus valley. (See note, p. 416.) *kelaina/s: an important town in the plain at the junction of the Marsyas and the Maeander. To the north-east was its acropolis on an outlying spur of the range Djebel-Sultan. Xerxes, on his return from Greece, is said to have built him a palace by the source of the Marsyas and a fortress on the acropolis above, while the younger Cyrus had a palace at the source of the Maeander and a large park round it (Xen. Anab. i. 2. 7, 8). Apameia was built by Antiochus I (circ. 275 B. C.) above the old town on the banks of the Marsyas. [For a full description see Ramsay, C. B. pp. 396-483.] Its most striking feature is the group of springs that form the headwater of the Maeander. A coin of Apameia, struck under Gordian, shows the local goddess surrounded by four river-gods entitled *mai/andros), *marsu/as), *qe/rma), *)orga/s). Of these the Therma must be the modern Ilidja, the only hot-spring of the place, while the Orgas may be the modern Norgas Chai; the Maeander is probably the Sheik Arab Su, rising in or near a lake behind a protruding ridge of Mount Djebel-Sultan, thence rushing down a ravine into the plain, but afterwards flowing gently round the spur of the protruding ridge and through the plain till it is joined by the Marsyas in the lower city of Celaenae. The Marsyas, called by H. *katarrh/kths, was a rapid stream 25 feet broad, rising in a cave beneath the acropolis, and flowing through the city; cf. Xen. Anab. i. 2.7; Strabo 577-8. Clearly this is the Dineir Water, described by Hamilton (i. 499): 'At the base of a rocky cliff a considerable stream of water gushes out with great rapidity. . . . It appeared as if it had formerly risen in the centre of a great cavern and that the surrounding rocks had fallen in from the cliffs above.' This entirely agrees with the descriptions of undoubted eyewitnesses, Xenophon and Strabo, who state that it rose from beneath the Acropolis hill. Possibly the Agora was just below, but more probably H. is in error. For a full discussion of the streams, with many references, cf. Ramsay, C. B. 397-412, 451-7. Xenophon (l. c.) says he saw the skin of Marsyas in the cave where the stream rose. Perhaps the local river-god, Masnes or Masses (M\u00fcller, F. H. G. iv. 629), whose stream made music and whose symbol was a water-skin, was confused with the spirit of flute-music. At any rate the mythical contest of Apollo and Marsyas typifies the struggle between the wilder Phrygian flute-music and the soberer music of the Greek lyre. Hence Marsyas is connected with other local heroes, 'inventors' of the flute and Phrygian mode, Hyagnis and Olympus, and also with the worship of the Mother of the Gods, and of Dionysus. *silhnou=. Marsyas is also called a Satyr, but this is a distinction without a difference, according to Miss Harrison (Prolegomena, p. 388). u(pokath/menos, 'awaited'; usually of lying in wait for (viii. 40. 2). *pu/qios: probably a son of the unfortunate son of Croesus (i. 34), who had inherited the colossal wealth of the Mermnad kings, since in the days of Cyrus it was not customary to confiscate the goods of conquered monarchs, and the Mermnadae had apparently taken no part in any revolt against Darius. The name Pythius might be due to Croesus' relation with Delphi (cf. v. 94 n., and the sons of Cimon Lacedaemonius, Eleius, and Thessalus). Plutarch (Mor. 263 B), in his moralizing tale, makes him governor of a city and an owner of gold mines. platani/stw| a)mpe/lw|: both were believed to be the and were renowned less for size than for the workmanship and precious stones, e.g. the bunches of grapes on the vine (Athenaeus xii. 514 f.). The date of the artist (cf. i. 51. 3; iii. 41. 1) shows that they must have been made for Alyattes and inherited by Pythius. After their transference to the treasury at Susa they became wonders of the world, though Antiochus the Arcadian, anxious to depreciate the resources vii. 1. 38). Their fame continued even in the middle ages, long after they had been melted down by Antigonus, 316 B. C. (Diodorus, xix. 48). *dareikw=n. On the gold 'Daric' cf. iii. 89. 2 n. *)/anaua.

Hamilton, i. 503: 'Owing to the great evaporation constantly going on the salt crystallizes on the surface and is scraped off with large wooden spades.' Colossae, three miles NNW. from the modern Chonas (*xw=nai), lies on the banks of the Lycus on rising ground that overhangs the river at the point where it enters a deep and picturesque gorge. It remained in 401 B. C. a populous city, prosperous and great (Xen. Anab. i. 2. 6), but decayed after the foundation of Laodicea (probably 260 B. C.), and was in Strabo's time a small town (po/lisma) (Strabo 576). H.'s account of the underground course of the Lycus is improbable compared with Strabo's, who says (578): 'It flows for the greater part of its course underground, and thereafter appears to view and joins other rivers.' This is the modern native account, according to which the source of the Lycus is in the lake of Anaua (just as that of the Maeander is in that of Aurocrene; cf. sup.). It issues from its underground course near Dere-Keui from beneath a chasm, where the sound of a subterranean river can be distinctly heard (Hamilton, i. 507). There is no probability that the Lycus ever flowed at Colossae through an underground channel five stadia long, or that arches were formed over it as over some smaller streams by petrifaction; but the stream does pass through a deep and narrow cleft of about that length, and in places goes underground for a few yards. H. has erroneously combined these facts; cf. G. Weber, M. A. I. (1891), xv. 196 f.; and for a more far-fetched B. 209-11. *ku/draran: identified by Radet (Lydie, p. 324 f.) with the Caraura of Strabo (578), on the boundary of Phrygia and Caria, but the name is interchangeable with Hydrela (Liv. xxxvii. 56), the variation of r and l being common. If so, it lay north of the Lycus, and southeast of the Maeander near Hierapolis (Steph. Byz.). A position in the valley of the Lycus, just before it joins the Maeander, suits H.'s narrative (Ramsay, C. and B. 85, 172-5). *kalla/thbon. Clearly in the Cogamus valley, probably near Ine G\u00f6l, since the tamarisk-tree, which gave the inhabitants their staple industry, is very abundant in the neighbourhood, but does not grow in the mountain passes to the south-east (Hamilton, ii. 374 f.). Radet's restoration of the name in an inscription found at Baharlar is shown to be most improbable (Anderson, J. H. S. xviii. 87-9). The 'honey' was made by thickening the tamarisk syrup with wheat-flour; cf. i. 193. 4; iv. 194. For the Persians' pride in the cultivation of trees cf. ch. 5. 3 n. Pliny (xvi, \u00a7 240) saw a similar tree near Apamea-Celaenae, and Hamilton (i. 517) 'the half-ruined trunk of one of the most gigantic he had ever seen' near Laodiceia ad Lycum. So a Lycian tree was honoured by the legate Licinius Mucianus for its girth and shade (Plin. xii, \u00a7 9). The Chinar or oriental plane is honoured in Persia (Yule, M. Polo, i. 135). a)qana/tw|. When the appointed guardian died, a successor was ready to take his place (Abicht), so there was always a guardian. 'Le roi est mort, vive le roi.' It was for the same reason that the 10,000 were called 'Immortals' (ch. 83. 1), but it does not seem likely that one of them was detailed for this duty (Rawlinson). With this account of Xerxes' march from Celaenae to Sardis should be compared the Anabasis of Cyrus in the opposite direction (Xen. Anab. i. 2. 6-9) and the distances there given (Macan, ii. 130).

This is the distance given by almost all ancient authors (iv. 85. 4; Plin. H.

The measurement can never have been correct except for the very narrowest part, which now measures over 2,000 yards, i. e. over ten stades. The difference may be explained by the washing away of the coasts by the strong currents which strike the European shore near Sestos and then rebound on the Asiatic at Abydos (cf. ch. 36 n.). H., from the way he gives the measurement here, seems to have held that both bridges were placed on each occasion at the narrowest part of the strait, but his view would seem to neglect the following considerations (see note, p. 416): (1) That the different number of ships used for the two bridges (ch. 36. 1) implies a difference of site or of angle. (2) That the current would be strongest in the narrowest part. (3) That not the cape itself, but the little valleys on either side would be the most convenient landing-places for the host. e)pike/sqai ma/stigi = mastigw=sai, hence with Soph. O. T. 809. Clearly to H. the implication was that the Hellespont was a slave to be scourged and chained; cf. Juv. x. 183, Mayor ad loc. The scourging, has, however, been interpreted (Spiegel, Eranisch. Alter. ii. 191) as a religious ceremony, or an attempt by magical rites to compel the Hellespont to submit. Again, the chains have been supposed to be an over-literal interpretation of Aeschylus' figurative description of who found the supposed branding suspicious, considered the other punishments (again alleged, ch. 54. 3; viii. 109. 3) a natural trait in Xerxes, in consonance with other rewards and punishments bestowed or inflicted by Persians on irrational or inanimate things iii. 16; vii. 54, 88). Religious and legal survivals show us how common the idea once was. Thus at Athens animals which had killed a human being, as well as inanimate instruments of death, were tried for murder (Ath. Pol. 57, ad fin.; Dem. Aristocr. 76, p. 645), and this old-world practice is approved by Plato (Laws, pp. 873-4). So Pausanias has recorded the punishment of two statues for accidental homicide (v. 27. 10; vi. 11. 6). The same point is illustrated by the ritual of the Bouphonia, Paus. i. 24. 4 (Frazer ad loc.), i. 28. 11; the guilt of slaying the ox is cast on the inanimate axe or knife. In the Zendavesta (Vendid. xiii. 5. 31) a dog (cf. Plut. Sol. 24), in the Jewish law an ox (Exodus xxi. 28), might be punished for murder. Animals were frequently tried in courts on the continent of Europe from A.D. 1120 to 1740. Finally, 'an Old English law only repealed in the reign of Victoria ordained that a beast that killed a man, a cartwheel that ran over him, or a tree that fell on him and killed him, was deodand, given to God, i. e. forfeited and sold for the benefit of the poor' (Tylor, P. C. i. 286; Frazer, Paus. ii. 371. 2). h)/dh de\\ h)/kousa: of a variant or additional story not credited by the author; cf. iv. 77. 2 n. stige/as. Runaway slaves were branded on the forehead as a punishment; cf. Arist. Av. 760drape/ths e)stigme/nos, and Juv. xiv. note. The branding of the Thebans (ch. 233. 2 n.) is probably a malicious tale. qu/ei: as to other water and rivers (i. 131. 2, 138. 2; cf. vii. 113. 2). The contempt for salt water, compared with the fertilizing water of springs and rivers, seems a genuinely Iranian view. potamw=|. The narrow land-locked Hellespont, with a stream running some three knots an hour, presents to a person sailing in it the appearance of a river: hence to Homer it is a)ga/rroos, and (for a river) platu/s and a)pei/rwn. This account of the bridges is full of unsolved difficulties. It is impossible to describe mechanism intelligibly without diagrams, as is shown by the obscurities in Caesar's account of his bridge over the Rhine (B. G. iv. 17). Further, since the bridges had long since perished, H. had to rely on hearsay, supplemented perhaps by inspection of the remains of the cables at Athens (\u00a7 3; cf. ix. 121). He adds to the difficulties of the description by attempting to give us the actual process of construction in four stages: (1) 'The putting of the bridge together.' It is significant that of this, the really important operation, he gives no account (\u00a7 1). (2) The securing of the bridge by anchors (\u00a7 2). (3) The stretching cables across to form the support of the roadway (\u00a7 3). (4) The making of the roadway (\u00a7\u00a7 4, 5). Cf. further Macan, ii, App. II, p. 142 f. toi=si timh/: a periphrasis for executioners; cf. ch. 39. 2; iii. 29. 2. a)/lloi a)rxite/ktones. The bridge-builder is said have \u00a7 2): not fastening the ships together as in a pontoon, but 'so placing them, that, while each of them was held in position by its own anchors, they lay in a line under the cables, near enough together to support them, and far enough apart to keep clear of each other in a high sea'. Arrian (Anab. v. 7) describes the operation as carried out by the Romans, contrasting their method with that described by H. The varying number of vessels used in the two bridges is due to the varying breadth of the straits (cf. 34 n.). H. does not mean that one bridge was built of triremes and the other of penteconters, but that both triremes and penteconters were used in both bridges, the triremes being used where the current flowed strongest, while differences in height above the water could be met by differences in loading. u(po\\ me\\n th/n (sc.ge/furan). H. regards the cables with the roadway as the true bridge. th\\n e(te/rhn: the bridge towards the Aegean as distinct from that nearer the Euxine. e)pikarsi/as (cf. i. 180. 3; iv. 101. 3 n.), 'at an angle', and properly at a right angle (L. & S.). The passage is taken in two completely different ways: (1) The whole of it is referred to both bridges (Grote, v. 362 f.; Rawlinson, Macan). 'The boats, which are parallel to the stream of the Hellespont (kata\\ r(o/on), are at a right angle to the Pontus.' The Hellespont in general is of course not at a right angle to the Euxine, or to the Propontis, if the Pontus includes that (cf. ch. 95 n.), though the portion between Abydos and Madytus (but not that between Abydos and Sestos) is. But H., who is often loose in his orientation, may well have believed the Hellespont to be at right angles to the Pontus. (Schweig. thinking the Pontus too remote, conjectured po/rou.) On this interpretation H. states rather loosely an obvious fact. (2) Stein (cf. also Grundy, p. 215; Hauvette, p. 295) takes e)pikarsi/as as referring to the upper (NE.) bridge, and kata\\ r(o/on to the lower (SW.) one. He takes e)pikarsi/as to mean 'athwart the current', and believes that H. has misunderstood or misreported his informants. He thinks the passage refers to the peculiarity of the local currents reported by Strabo (591). The current is not parallel to the banks, but a little south of Sestos, near the tower of Hero, runs right across the strait to Abydos (cf. Polyb. xvi. 29), so that if you want to cross from Sestos to Abydos you row down to the tower of Hero and then are carried across by the current; if from Abydos to Sestos, you row a mile along the Asiatic shore before crossing, so as to avoid meeting the current full. The landing-place near Sestos was called *)apo/baqra, north-east bridge (Strabo 331, fr. 55). Hence the ships of the north-east bridge would have been 'oblique' to the direction of the straits, because their prows were turned to face the strong local crosscurrent, while those of the south-west bridge would be strictly parallel to the banks of the Hellespont. The objections to this interpretation are (1) the inferior meaning given to e)pikarsi/as and the extreme difficulty of separating it from kata\\ r(o/on; (2) the improbability that H., who ignores the current, should thus indirectly and obscurely allude to its action. a)nakwxeu/h| (sc.h( ge/fura): so that the bridge (i. e. here the moored ships) might give the strained cables support (abstract for concrete; cf. \u00a7 4 and ix. 118. 1). B\u00e4hr, however, thinks the cables are those of the anchors mentioned in the next line, and that the current (o( r(o/os was to 'keep e(te/rhs. Clearly each row of ships must have had anchors on both sides to keep it in place. H. is either stating this imperfectly or altogether omits these ordinary anchors in his anxiety to draw attention to those of special size and strength on the side of exposure. The north-east bridge would feel the gales from the Euxine, the south-west one those from the Aegean. e(spe/rhs.

If H. means that the cables were all in one piece, he is of course wrong, as the weight would be too great; doubtless each was made in eight or ten pieces; the length of modern cables is 720 feet. ou)ke/ti, 'not again,' the failure of the first bridge being ascribed to the weakness of the cables. kata\\ lo/gon, 'proportionately' (i. 134. 2). The four byblos ropes were absolutely heavier than the two esparto-grass. ta/lanton: probably the talent of commerce weighing 138/100 of the Attic coinage standard, i. e. according to Hultsch (Metrol.2 135) 3615 Kilo, roughly 80 lb., or, according to Gardner, 377 Kilo nearly 84 lb.

The neglect of these breakwaters would account for the silting up of the canal at its two ends. a(/ma tw=| e)/ari. Early in April, 480 B. C. Xerxes took three months to march from the Hellespont to Athens (viii. 54. 1). He probably reached Athens about the middle of September, and must have taken ten days at least to march from Thermopylae to Athens (about 100 miles), which agrees with the fact that the fighting at Thermopylae took place just after the Olympian festival (Aug. 17-20), that is in the last ten days of August. From Therma to Thermopylae (about 175 miles) Xerxes had marched rapidly in fourteen (or perhaps sixteen) days (vii. 183, 196). If we add the delay at Thermopylae (6-8 days), it follows that Xerxes left Therma at the beginning of August. He had halted there for a good many days (vii. 131), and at Abydos (viii. 51 and sup.) a month. A month is not too long to allow for the march from Sardis to Abydos (250 miles), nor a month and a half from Sestos to Therma (over 300 miles). This calculation agrees with H.'s three months from Sestos to Athens (viii. 51), and adding forty-five days for his return (viii. 115), with the seven months of the king's absence (Corn. Nepos, Them. 5). According to the calculations of Zech and Hofmann (cf. Busolt, ii. 662, 715) five eclipses took place in the years (481-478): (1) Total, April 18, 481, visible on the Indian Ocean (and at Susa). (2) Total, April 8, 480, visible from New Zealand to South America. (3) Partial, October, 480, visible in Corinth and at Sardis; this eclipse is mentioned by H., ix. 10. 3. (4) Partial, Feb. 27, 479, visible in Siberia and the Polar Seas. (5) Annular, Feb. 16, 478, visible in Sardis. Since this is the only one visible in Sardis in spring it has usually been held that it was erroneously pre-dated in local tradition to connect it with the expedition, superstition naturally converting such phenomena into omens (cf. i. 74 and vi. 98). The chronology cannot be altered to suit the eclipse of 478, since its accuracy is guaranteed by the eclipse in the autumn of 480 (cf. ix. 10. 3), and by the fact that the expedition of Xerxes took place in an Olympic year (vii. 206. 2; viii. 26. 2, 72). Meyer (iii, \u00a7 205 n.) follows Judeich (Hist. Zeit. xlii, 148) in the probable suggestion that the error consists in the transference of the eclipse seen at Susa in 481 to Sardis in 480. If so the connexion with Pythius would be due to a false combination by H., but the error would be trifling compared with that of pre-dating the eclipse of 478. o( qeo/s = h(/lios. prode/ktwr, coined from prodei/knumi, 'one who foreshows.' The declaration that the sun is the prophet of the Greeks might be justified to a Greek by the identification with Apollo, the god of oracles at Delphi, Branchidae, &c., but it cannot be a Persian view, since Mithra, the god of light, identified at least in the popular religion with the sun, is next in honour to Ormuzd (cf. ch. 54. 2). Cf. i. 131. n. If Pythius was the grandson of Croesus (ch. 27. 1), he would probably be between seventy and eighty in 480 B. C. For a parallel case of punishment by Darius cf. iv. 84. Gobineau (Hist. des Perses, ii. 195) remarks that it was a Persian custom to make those one wished to preserve from harm pass between two parts of a sacrificed animal (cf. Gen. xv. 10, 17; Jer. xxxiv. 18, 19); the more valuable the victim the greater the efficacy of the charm. Thus the slaughter of the son of Pythius might be a propitiatory sacrifice for the army. But the whole story has the look of a legend. a)nami/c. The tribal levies marched one close upon another, not in well-marked orderly divisions (ou) diakekrime/noi).

The Nesaean breed of horses (iii. 106. 2; ix. 20. 5) was famous throughout antiquity, but the position of the plain is not quite clear. Arrian (Anab. vii. 13, cf. Strabo 525; Diodorus, xvii. 110) identified it with the great pastures (leimw\\n i(ppo/botos, Strabo) on the road from Ispahan and Behistun to Hamadan (Egbatana), where in ancient, as in modern times, great herds of thoroughbreds were kept. This, as H. says, is in Media, and might be the Median district Nis\u00e2ya mentioned by Darius in the Behistun inscription (i. 13. 10). The region Nis\u00e2ya in the Vendidad (i, \u00a7\u00a7 8-26) is much further east, lying in the neighbourhood of Merv, i. e. Margiana; it might then be Nisaea, capital of Parthyene (Plin. vi. 113; cf. Isidor. Charax, p. 254. Miller), placed by Strabo (509, 511) near Hyrcania on the river Ochus. *dio/s: i. e.

Cane is the modern Karadagh, the cape opposite Mytilene, forming one extremity of the bay of Adramyttium, Lectum (ix. 114) being the other. For Atarneus cf. i. 160; vi. 28, 29. *qh/bhs pedi/ou. The beautiful and fertile plain, reaching from the head of the gulf of Adramyttium to Antandrus, is named after the Homeric *qh/bh u(poplaki/h (Il. vi. 396; xxii. 479), the birthplace of Andromache, of which city Strabo (612) saw ruins at the foot of Mount Ida. The chief town of the plain was Adramyttium, where the ejected Delians settled in the Peloponnesian war (Thuc. v. 1; viii. the meaning is that from Antandrus Xerxes turned inland, and after he had reached or occupied Ida, marched to the left, presumably down the valley of the Scamander to Troy. Xenophon, who marched along this route in the opposite direction from Ophryneum near Rhoeteum, past Troy to Antandrus, also speaks of going over Mount Ida (Anab. vii. 8. 7, 8).

We must therefore suppose either that this sacrifice to Athena and the heroes was intended to conciliate the Asiatic Greeks (Hauvette, p. 303; cf. viii. 54, 133; ix. 42), or that H. has misunderstood some Iranian rites (cf. ch. 113. 2; Duncker, vii. 202, v. 175). *ge/rgiqas: the name of the tribe whose chief town (called *ge/rgis, *ge/rgiqa, *ge<*>/rgiqos) lay on the east side of the o)/ros (Steph.

In Xenophon's day still a po/lis e)xura/ (Hell. iii. 1. 15), it had ceased to exist in the time of Strabo though the name was still preserved in the neighbourhood. The tribe may once have inhabited the coast as far as Miletus, since the name was preserved also on the river Caicus and near Cyme (Strabo 589, 616), and the subject population in Miletus was so called (Athen. 524 A).

They waited for the rising of the sun because the appearance of the heavenly light was an auspicious moment for any great undertaking, e.g. for the choice of a king from among the seven (iii. 84. 3). The same observances are again ascribed to the Persians (viii. 99. 1), but the ceremonies are suspiciously Hellenic; holy meat (myazda), placed on the draona or consecrated cakes, holy water (zaothra, the Vedic hotra), prepared with certain rites, and the Haoma (inf.). spe/ndwn. Since libations of wine were not customary in Persia (i. 132. 1) this libation must have been of the holy water zaothra, or more probably of the intoxicating juice of the golden Haoma (Darmesteter, op. cit., p. xix). The drinking of this by the faithful was deemed acceptable to the gods. Though Mithra, the god of the heavenly light, is not invoked along with Ormuzd by any king before Artaxerxes II Mnemon (404-359 B. C.) [in an inscription where he is mentioned along with the goddess Anahita, with whom H. confuses him (i. 131)], yet since Mitra appears in the Veda, and Mithra in the older formulae of the Zend-avesta, we may accept the statement that Xerxes sacrificed to him.

Hell. i. 5. 10). Many of the ships had come far, so that their timbers would be foul; they were now prepared for the actual campaign. The enormous numbers, and the na\u00efve and cumbrous method of counting, make this story as it stands incredible. Indeed the numbering and organization of the whole army cannot have been deferred so long, though such contingents as first joined Xerxes in Europe may have been mustered at Doriscus. List of the tribal contingents composing the army and fleet of Xerxes. This full list of the tribal contingents composing the army of Xerxes with their commanders, and the description of their equipment, not only gives us a graphic picture of that immense host, but also much new and interesting information about the inhabitants of the Persian Empire. Taken in conjunction with the list of Satrapies (iii. 90 f.) and the description of the Royal Road (v. 52 f.) it is our best authority for the ethnography of the Ancient East. The number of the peoples enumerated (including the name omitted in ch. 76 and the Sagartians, ch. 85) is sixty-one, and besides the obvious division into infantry (61-83) from forty-six nations, cavalry (84-8) from eight nations, and sailors (89-99) from twelve nations, a geographical arrangement is discernible. First, after the Medes and Persians, come the Eastern tribes from the Tigris to the Indus (62-8), secondly the Southern (69-71), thirdly the tribes of Asia Minor (72-9), and lastly the maritime peoples of the Levant (89-95). Following Macan (ii. 167-76) we may distinguish seventeen or eighteen types of armour in the army and navy of Xerxes to be grouped in six classes. I. (1) The Medo-Persian (ch. 61, 62; cf. ch. 80). Besides the bow and dagger this includes a short spear, and for defence a wicker shield (ge/rron) and in some cases a cuirass. II. The Iranians rely on the bow and for hand to hand work on the dagger; they have no defensive armour. The varieties are (2) the Bactrians (ch. 64. 1 and 66), with short spears; (3) the Pactyans (ch. 67, 68; cf. the 2); and (5) the Sagartians, with lassos (ch. 85). III. The Anatolians, whose most distinctive weapons are the small round targe and for offence the javelin, though most of them have also spear, dagger, or bow. The chief varieties are (6) the Paphlagonian (ch. 72, 73); (7) and (10) the Lycian (ch. 92). IV. (11) The Assyrians (ch. 63), and (12) Egyptians (ch. 89), who have metal helmets, large shields, and quilted cuirasses, and for offence spears, daggers, and pikes or clubs. With these may perhaps be classed (13) the Phoenicians (ch. 89), though the character of their armour is eclectic. V. (14) The Greeks (ch. 93-5) have metal helmets, greaves, and cuirasses, shields, swords, and spears. To this type the Lydians (ch. 74), Pamphylians (ch. 91), Cypriotes (ch. 90), (ch. 93) conform. VI. The outer barbarians, ill-armed for the most part with bows. Varieties are (15) the Indians (ch. 65; cf. ch. 70); (16) the African Ethiopians (ch. the Libyans (ch. 71); and (18) the Arabians (ch. 69) riding on camels (ch. 87). In details and arrangement this list differs from that of the Satrapies (iii. 90 f.), but is not inconsistent with it. While it is impossible to say from what source H. derived these lists (Introd., \u00a7 21), in both cases the ultimate authority must be official Persian documents such as the king's scribes prepared (ch. 100). The authority H. followed gave the names of the tribes and their commanders, and a description of their equipment, but no numbers (ch. 60). As Meyer (F. ii. 231, 232) suggests, it probably also supplied information as to the march from Celaenae to Therma (ch. 26-131), as may be seen by a comparison of the account to this point with the vague and imperfect reports of the advance through Thessaly (vii. 196, 197), and of the retreat of Xerxes (viii. 113-20, 126-9) and of Artabazus (ix. 89). H. himself added notes (often erroneous) on the origin and early history of the peoples enumerated (cf. ch. 61. 2, 3, 62. 1, 74. 1, 75. 2), as he does in the case of the Greeks (viii. 43 f., 72, 73). He supplied numbers from conjecture (vii. 184 f.) or tradition (vii. 89); he inserted conversations of Xerxes with Artabanus and Demaratus, intended to explain the character and purpose of the great invasion; but there is no reason to suppose that he used any literary source except the Persae of Aeschylus, or drew much from the list of the host of Darius engraved at Byzantium (iv. 87), or the picture of it dedicated by Mandrocles in the Heraeum at Samos (iv. 88). o( tia/ras (Att. h( tia/ra; i. 132. 1): a Persian word meaning a soft felt or cotton hat projecting at the top a little in front, as seen in the Persian sculptures at Persepolis. a)page/as: opposed to pephgw/s (ch. it stiff (Xen. Anab. ii. 5. 23; many colours' can hardly be the same as cuirasses, nor can the words lepi/dos . . . i)xquoeide/os well refer to mere ornaments on a tunic. Hence it seems necessary to distinguish the tunic and the corselet as is done elsewhere 1 and Anab. i. 5. 8, 8. 6). We must then insert some words, e.g. kai\\ qw/rhkas. Such corselets of scale armour are represented on Egyptian and Assyrian monuments, and at Nimrud Layard found a great quantity of scales which might well be sewed on a felt or quilted linen jerkin. Not all the Persians would have such a costly panoply (cf. viii. 113. 2), but H. describes the most characteristic armour. The sleeved tunics are well shown on sculptures from Persepolis (Perrot et Chipiez, Persia, fig. 192, p. 402, E.T.), and the many colours on the archer frieze from Susa now in the Louvre (op. cit. pl. xii, p. 500). lepi/dos, 'made with iron scales like the scales of a fish.' a)nacuri/das: cf. i. 71. 2 n. ge/rra: cf. ix. 61. 3. Probably oval shields with holes at the side (as in the Boeotian), for some of the Persepolis guards carry shields of the kind. (See note, p. 416.) The spears represented on the monuments at Susa and Persepolis seem to be seven feet long, and the bows rather less than four feet; but the expressions 'long' and 'short' are relative to the corresponding Greek weapons. e)gxeiri/dia: cf. ch. 54. 2 n. No historical conclusions can be drawn from this confused jumble of myths and names. The Cephenes are a mythical people identified with the Eastern Ethiopians (Apollod. ii. 4. 3). Possibly H. means them to be Assyrians (vi. 54), and then by a further confusion connects the Assyrians with their successors in the lordship of Asia (cf. ch. 11. 4), the Medes and Persians. But the explanation of the whole matter is the likeness of the names *perseu/s and *pe/rshs, which led the Greeks to make the eponymous *pe/rshs son of Perseus (vii. 150. 2; cf. i. 125. 3; vii. 220. 4), and then, since Perses is related to Cepheus, to identify the Persians and the Cephenes. This genealogy is inconsistent with that given in i. 7, since Belus is grandfather (in-law) to Perseus, and Perseus great-grandfather to Heracles, and yet (in i. 7) Belus is grandson of Heracles. Cf. also vi. 54 n. *)artai=oi (a proper name; cf. 22. 2, 66. 2): derived from arta, high, noble, good. Cf. Artaxerxes (vi. 98. 3 n.), Artabanus, &c. Perhaps it is connected with *)/arioi (E. Meyer in Pauly-Wissowa, ii. 1303). Hellanicus invented from it a region of Persia, *)artai/a (Steph. Byz.). au)tou=. In the kingdom of Cepheus, which, however, is placed by the earlier mythographers on the coast of Palestine, or at Nineveh or Babylon, and by the later in African Ethiopia, and never, except here, in Persia. th\\n au)th/n (sc.stolh/n): as in ch. 72, 84. For this dress cf. i. 135 n. *tigra/nhs fell at the head of the Persian army at Mycale (ix. 96, 102). *)/arioi. To be distinguished from the *)/arioi or *)/areioi of ch. 66. 1 n. (cf. iii. 93. 3 n.). The word used here in Aesch. Choeph. 423 = Persian ariya, Zend airya, Sansk. \u00e2rya = the worthy, noble (cf. E. Meyer, i. 572 n.), and would apply to all Iranian races who thus distinguished themselves from the unclean barbarians (Zend anairya). So Darius calls himself on his tomb at Nak-shi-Rustam 'an Achaemenid, a Persian, the son of a Persian, an Arian of Arian race'. In Vend. i. 3. 6, Airyana-Vaego, the first land created is the garden of Eden and paradise of the Iranian religion. *mhdei/hs. This legend, which arises from yet wilder etymological guesswork than that of Perses, seems to be for *mh=doi in Pind. Pyth. i. 78. For its developed form cf. Paus. ii. 3. 8; Apollod. i. 9. 28. The authority of the Medes can hardly vouch for more than the existence of the name *)/arioi; but H. clearly believed that the Oriental nations claimed, or at least accepted, these mythical connexions with Greece, so the Persians (i. 1 n.; vii. 61, 150; vi. 54), the Egyptians (ii. 91, 98. 2, 113 f.), &c. Yet only Hellenized interpreters can have done so. mitrhfo/roi. The mitra seems to have been a kind of turban, covering the head from the forehead to the nape of the neck and the chin, under which it passed, as seen on a Persian in the Pompeian mosaic of Issus. Rawlinson, however, thinks it may have been a mere fillet, as seen on Assyrian bas-reliefs and on the frieze from Susa. *)ota/new. Stein distinguishes Otanes, father of Amestris (ch. 40, 61, 82), not only from the son of Sisamnes (v. 25, &c.), but also from the conspirator of Bk. III (cf. vi. 43). The latter would no doubt have been old for a command, as he must have been about eighty in 480 B. C., since he had a marriageable daughter in 522 B. C. (iii. 68). But probably Stein is wrong. The Otanes here must have been a person of great importance, since he was the king's fatherin-law, and he may have been only nominally general of the Persians, like the colonels of English regiments. His sons, too, have high commands, and one of them, Anaphes or Onophas, has the same name as the son of the conspirator (cf. iii. 68 n.). Macan suggests that the fact that H. seems only to know of one Otanes in Bk. VII, as contrasted with the full knowledge in Bks. III and V, points to the earlier composition of Bk. VII. *(urka/nioi: cf. iii. 92. 2 n. *)assu/rioi. For the extent, &c., of Assyria cf. i. 178. 1 n. Crested helmets of round or conical shape may be seen on Assyrian bas-reliefs, but those found have been of iron, not of bronze. peplegme/na: probably made of leather thongs, cf. 85. 1; and for similar helmets 72. 1, 79, 89. 3. No such thing appears on the monuments. tetulwme/na: clubs studded with broad iron nails; cf. appear on Assyrian monuments, though maces are represented. line/ous: cf. iii. 47. The monuments make much of Assyrian archers, but H. does not mention the bow among the national weapons. *su/rioi: cf. i. 6. 1 n.*)assu/rioi: Semit. Ash\u00fbr, Pers. Athur\u00e2. The last sentence is clearly an interpolated marginal note of later date. Its want of connexion, the strange use of metacu/ for meta/, and the inconsistency in the use of *xaldai=oi (cf. i. 181. 5 n. betray this. *ba/ktrioi: cf. iii. 92. 2 n. kurbasi/h = tia/ra. Compare v. 49. 3 ad fin. with vii. 61 ad init. and Arist. Aves 487. e)s 'stiff, upright' (ch. 70. 2, ad fin.). The apparent inconsistency of this with the statement that the great king alone wore the upright tiara (ch. 61. 1 n.) is removed by the facts that the Sacae are not Persians, and that they naturally wore the high-peaked felt or sheep-skin caps of their country, as does the Sacan captive in the sculptures at Behistun. For Scythian dress cf. Minns, Greeks and Scythians, pp. 54 f., and for arms, pp. 66 f. a)ci/nas in apposition to saga/ris explaining the foreign word (cf. iii. 12. 4). *)amurgi/ous with *sku/qas. The name is preserved Byz. pedi/on *sakw=n, while Amorges the time of Cyrus (Ctes. Pers. \u00a7 3) or of Darius (Polyaen. vii. 12). Apparently (Meyer, i, \u00a7 578 n.) H. confuses three tribes distinguished by Darius in the inscription on his tomb at Nak-shiRustam, i.e. the Sak\u00e2, Haumavark\u00e2, and the Saka tigrakhauda probably = Scyths with pointed caps (cf. iii. 93. 3). They are of course distinct from the Scyths of Europe, though, like them, nomads of the steppes. The Indians, like the Persians, called them \u00c7ac\u00e2. *)indoi/: cf. iii. 94. 2 n. a)po\\ cu/lwn: i.e. cotton; cf. iii. 47. 2, 106. 3 n. kalami/nous: for the bamboo cf. iii. 98. 1 n. *)/arioi: cf. iii. 93. 3 and vii. 62. 1 n. For these peoples cf. iii. 91. 4 n. and 93. 3 n., and on Artabazus, viii. 126 n. *ka/spioi: cf. ch. 86. 2; probably those of iii. 93. 3 (cf. n.), not of iii. 92. 2. sisu/rnas: cloaks ofhide (iv. 109. 2). *sara/ggai (iii. 93. 2 n.) . . . e)ne/prepon. Their dyed robes made them conspicuous among their hide-clad companions. *pa/ktues: cf. iii. 93. 1 n. For these three tribes cf. iii. 92. 1 n. and 93. 2 n. *)ara/bioi: cf. iii. 88. 1 n. zeira/s (cf. 75. 1): apparently a Semitic word, means a long flowing mantle held in by a girdle (u(pezwsme/noi), like the burnous of the modern Arab. pali/ntona. In the ordinary Greek bow, as in the modern, stringing merely increased the natural curve; but there was also another form (pali/ntona), which when strung was bent back wards against the natural curve. This must have given it tremendous power. The bow of Odysseus, which is called both pali/ntona (Od. xxi. 11, 59) and kampu/la (xxi. 359), was (xxi. 395) apparently made, like that of Pandarus, of two goat's-horns joined together by a straight stock in the centre (Il. iv. 105 seq.). Similar is the 37). pro\\s decia/: at the right side, an unusual position. foi/nikos spa/qhs: a long strip of split palm-wood probably hardened in the fire (Strabo 822), not the stem of the palm-leaf (Rawlinson, L. & S.). The length of the bow would make it unnecessary to bend it much, so small arrows would be appropriate. tulwta/: cf. 63 n. Wooden clubs made of acacia or ebony are still used by Ethiopians. These clubs and garments of skins loosely girt on (e)namme/noi) characterize Ethiopians in Egyptian paintings, Cf. woodcuts in Rawlinson on iii. 97. tw=n u(pe\\r *ai)gu/ptou: the Nubian tribes just above Egypt. Cf. ii. 29. 4 f.; iii. 97. 2 f.; and iii. 17 1 n. Arsames is said to be governor of Memphis by Aeschylus (Pers. 37). For the division of Ethiopians cf. iii. 17. 1 n. For the Asiatic Ethiopians cf. iii. 94. 2 n. o)rqa\\ pephgo/ta: cf. ch. 64. 2 n. problh/mata: cf. iv. 175. 1 ad fin. *li/bues (cf. iii. 13. 3) . . . goatskins'; cf. iv. cf. ch. 63. 1 n. Xen. Anab. 13kra/nh oi(=a/per (mod. Kutais) in Colchis a Ligurian city, which leads many modern writers to identify them with Strabo's *lh=gai (p. 503), the modern Lesghians in the Eastern Caucasus (cf. the Sigynnae, v. 9 n.). But the tribes here connected with them belong to the middle and lower Halys, and this people might have disappeared from the Halys basin after the Gallic immigration (278 B.C.), as apparently do the Western Matieni (i. 72. 2 n.). *mariandunoi/: cf. iii. 90. 2 n. *su/rioi: cf. i. 6. 1 n., 72. 1; Cappadocians. For this immigration cf. i. 7. 3 n.; App. I, \u00a7 8. The Macedonians, however, rather succeeded than dwelt with long discredited, is more acceptable now that the primitive home of the Aryans is held by many to be the steppes of Southern Russia, not the Asiatic plateau. In any case the relationship seems certain. So Gen. x. 3, Togarmah (Armenia) is brother of Ashkenaz (Phrygia; cf. the Phrygian hero Ascanius, and the lake and district Ascania). The name Armenia (Armina) appears first in the inscriptions of Darius; cf. i. 15 n. For the Maeonians cf. i. 7. 3 n. and App. I, \u00a7 3. a)/poikoi. In i. 171. 6 kasi/gnhtoi and a)delfeoi/. For the 'Mysian' invasion cf. vii. 20 n. *)olu/mpou. The Mysian Olympus is just south-west of the Propontis. *qrh/ikes: not exactly defined till 2 ad fin. as oi( e)n th=| *)asi/h|; cf. ch. 69. 1 69. 1. pe/dila nebrw=n, 'deer-skin buskins'; cf. iii. 9. 1. pe/ltas. Apparently the first time this light shield, afterwards so famous, appears in history. The European Thracians wore a similar costume suited to the rigour of the climate; invasion of Bithynia may be regarded as a later continuation of the Phrygian immigrations; cf. v. 13. 2; vii. 20. 2 n. and 73. Obviously a name is lost at the beginning of this chapter. The older editors for the most part follow Wessling in supplying *xa/lubes from the spurious list in i. 28, but clearly a tribe in the immediate neighbourhood of the Cabalees and Milyae is required to complete the command of Badres. The hardiest warriors of that region were the *pisi/dai, whose name may have been left out by the scribe from its likeness to a)spi/das. As, however, H. never mentions these unruly mountaineers, who probably never as a people acknowledged Persian sovereignty (cf. iii. 90. 1 n.), it may be better to take from iii. 90 the name of one of the smaller tribes there mentioned, either the *laso/nioi (whose name seems to have been wrongly put into the text in ch. 77. 1), or the *(ute/nnes, or both (Stein). (See note, p. 416. probo/lous: like probo/laion (ch. 148. 3) a variant of probo/lion, a hunting-spear. lukioerge/as: an emendation in Athenaeus, p. for lukoerge/as, 'wolf-destroying.' The sense 'made in Lycia' is supported fin.). The oracle of Ares is probably an indication of a northern origin; cf. v. 7; iv. 59, 62. *kabhle/es: cf. iii. 90. 1 n. Perhaps *laso/nioi has been erroneously transferred to this passage from 76; cf. n. ad loc. *ki/lici: cf. ch. 91. *milu/ai: cf. i. 173. 2 n.; iii. 90. 1. e)nepeporpe/ato, 'had their cloaks fastened by brooches.' The retention of the plaid and fibula is the characteristic noted, appropriate to highlanders. to/ca *lu/kia: cf. ch. 92 and 76 n. For these tribes, independent in Xenophon's time (Anab. vii. 8. 25), and for the Mares (ch. 79) cf. iii. 94 n. Xenophon also (Anab. v. 4. 12, 13; cf. the Macrones, iv. 8. 3) gives the Mosynoeci lances 9 feet long, and adds steel battle-axes, leather helmets, and large wicker shields (ge/rra). *)artau+/kths: cf. ix. 116 f. plekta/: cf. ch. 63 n. *ko/lxoi (on Darius' inscriptions Karka) were a semi-independent tribe (iii. 97. 4). Apparently a trade-route led from Persia through Media by Ecbatana and Lake Urmia to the upper Araxes and the Saspeirians, and thence over the mountains to Colchis and the Euxine (i. 104; iv. 37). deute/rw| e)/tei+ tou/twn: the next year after this (vi. 46. 1), i.e. 479 B.C. For the facts cf. viii. 130. 2; ix. 102. 4 ad fin. te/los is a regiment, i.e. an organized body of troops of a particular kind (i. 103. 1), horse (ch. 87; ix. 20, 22. 1, 23. 1) or foot (ch. 211. 3). It is much the same as ta/cis (cf. ch. 212. 2 with 211. 3; ix. 42. 1), and is contrasted with the e)/qnos or tribal contingent; cf. ix. 33. 1. In all probability the words *smerdome/nhs o( *)ota/new should come after a)neyioi/, as otherwise we must suppose that Otanes (cf. ch. 40) was a brother of Darius, or married his sister, of which we hear nothing elsewhere. Further, the relationship of Mardonius to Xerxes noticed above (ch. 5. 1) would here be strangely omitted. a)delfew=n would seem to include brother and sister, since Tritamaechmes was son of Darius' brother, and Mardonius of his sister. *masi/sths: cf. ix. 107, 113. *mega/buzos: cf. iii. 160. *ge/rgis. The name of this otherwise unknown man comes in strangely here and in ch. 121 among members of the families of the king and of the Seven (iii. 84). The whole army (excluding the guard) is divided into six corps, or perhaps into three divisions each commanded by a pair of generals; cf. ch. 121. Golden ornaments were common among the Persians; cf. ix. 80; Xen. Anab. i. 2. 27, 8. 29, &c. *(ippeu/ei de\\ tau=ta ta\\ e)/qnea. The natural meaning of this is that all the nations already named were accustomed to fighting on horseback, though only those enumerated below furnished horse for this particular expedition (cf. 87. 1). Stein, however, thinks it impossible that all of them can have been horsemen, and would therefore make tau=ta equivalent to ta/de, 'the following' (cf. i. 125. 1 n.). He believes H. to promise a complete account of all the horsemen of the Empire and then at once to correct himself by restricting the list to those who actually furnished cavalry on this occasion. For a similar na\u00efve correction cf. v. 99. 2; and for plh/n, vii. 32. poih/mata: cf. iv. 5. 3; prob. helmets of beaten bronze and iron (e)celhlame/na) and curious in shape (cf. ch. 63) instead of the tia=rai (ch. 61. 1). *saga/rtioi: cf. iii. 93. 2 n. kai\\ fwnh=|. If these words are not a note later thrust into the text, something like ge/nei te must have fallen out before them (van Herwerden), or xrew/menon *persikh=| after them (Stein). metacu/: half Persian (ch. 61), half Pactyan (ch. 68). For metacu/ cf. ii. 42. 4. For the use of the lasso by Sarmatians cf. Persians by the Shahnahmeh, to the Parthians by Suidas, and is represented on Assyrian monuments (Macan). It was also practised by the Huns and Alans, as it still is by cowboys and Indians in America. o)/noi a)/grioi. Wild asses are represented on bas-reliefs in Assyria and at Persepolis. They are still found in desert plains from northwest India and Baluchistan to Persia, Syria, and Arabia. The wild ass is, however, like the zebra, difficult to tame (cf. Job xxxix. 5). a(/rmata. These war-chariots are never heard of in the actual fighting. Cf., however, for African war-chariots, iv. 193, and warchariots in general v. 113 n. kai\\ *ka/spioi o(moi/ws: *sa/kai (Munro, J. p. 297), for (1) otherwise the Sacae who specially distinguished themselves as cavalry at Plataea (ix. 71. 1) would be omitted from the list of horsemen; (2) the Sacan infantry is brigaded with the Bactrians (vii. 64). *k*a*i *s*a*k*a*i might easily be corrupted into *k*a*s*p*i*o*i through reduplication of kai/ and the proximity of *ka/spioi in \u00a7 2, where it may stand if emended in \u00a7 1. The emendations attempted 1) and *ka/sioi, a tribe from Cashmere (Ptol. vi. 15), are inadmissible, since the horse are said to be armed like the foot, so the tribe must have been already mentioned among the infantry (cf. ch. 67). The speed of the best camels does not exceed ten miles an hour, but H. is consistent if wrong; cf. iii. 102. 3. Camels are mentioned ch. 83, 125; ix. 81. *su/roisi. The Philistines on the coast south of Mount Carmel; cf. iii. 5. 1 n. For the linen corslets cf. ii. 182; iii. 47. ou(=toi de/. This does not distinguish these Phoenicians from others, but merely introduces the author's own ethnographical and historical additions to the official list of contingents; cf. esp. ch. 91 ad init. et fin., 93. 1, 95 ad fin., and in the Greek list, viii. 45, 46. 2. For the Phoenician migration cf. i. 1. n. The Egyptians, perhaps in consequence of their recent revolt (ch. 1), were not employed as land-troops till after Salamis; cf. ix. 32. 2. They are most effective (viii. 17) as marines, perhaps on account of their heavy armour, 'boarding-pikes and pole-axes.' xhleuta/ = plekta/ (ch. 79. 1), 'plaited.' a)spi/das. The Egyptians in the earliest times carried gigantic shields; in the time of the Theban empire moderate sized bucklers rounded at the top were substituted, but a concave shape or a large rim of metal is rare. Shield and lance are to Plato (Tim. 24 B) their national weapons. do/rata nau/maxa: boarding-spears are represented in the sea-fight of Rameses III (monument at Med\u00eenet Habu). tu/xous: a pole-axe, with a single head and a shaft 2 to 2 1/2 feet long, was often borne by officers. qwrhkofo/roi: probably wearing quilted cuirasses; scale armour is, however, represented in the tomb of Rameses III at Thebes. maxai/ras mega/las: large trowel-shaped daggers are borne by the troops of Rameses II. oi( basile/es: cf. v. 110 n. kiqw=nas. de Pauw's conjecture kita/rias is probable. The ki/taris, a kind of felt hat (cf. Pollux, x. 163 and esp. vii. 58), is contrasted with the mi/tra of the kings. The population of Cyprus contained Anatolian, Greek, and Phoenician elements; cf. v. 104 n. *salami=nos. Salamis is a Mycenean centre and afterwards took the lead among the Greek settlements in Cyprus. The supposed connexion with the island of Salamis may be an inference from an accidental similarity of name. The Aeacid Teucer was said to have fled from home with some Trojan captives and settled in Salamis. Honours were paid to Teucer as their heroic ancestor by the Gergithes of the Troad (ch. 43. 2 n.), and the existence at Salamis of a class called *ge/rginoi, who claimed to be Gergithes (Athen. pp. 255, 256) was held to prove the connexion. *)aqhne/wn: because Salamis, like its Aeacid heroes, was treated as Attic. *)arkadi/hs. Agapenor, king of Tegea, was held to be the founder of Paphos (ch. 195 n.). The Cypriote dialect resembles the Arcadian, i.e. the oldest Peloponnesian (cf. v. 113 n.). *ku/qnou. Fugitive Dryopes were believed to have emigrated from Cythnus, a small island among the Cyclades, to Cyprus; cf. viii. 46. 4; Diod. iv. 37. *ai)qiopi/hs. For conquests of Cyprus by Egypt cf. ii. 182 n. The statement here, however, seems to rest on a legendary genealogy connecting Cinyras, the founder of the temple at Paphos, with the Asiatic Aethiopia, i.e. Assyria. Cyprus submitted to Sargon of Assyria, 709 B.C., and paid tribute to Esar-haddon and Assurbani-pal (cf. v. 104 n.). a)gxota/tw pepoihme/na=w(moiwme/na: hence with dative, whereas elsewhere in H. a)gxou=, &c., are followed by the genitive. *(upaxaioi/: probably a native name assimilated by the Greek settlers to the familiar *)/axaioi. The Greek colonies in Cilicia seem somewhat later than those in Pamphylia and Cyprus; Tarsus was ascribed to Argives led brother of Europa, Phoenix, and Cadmus, seems merely the mythical representation of Phoenician colonization in Cilicia. Cf. iv. 147. 4 (Thera) and vi. 47. 1 (Thasos). Cilicia Pedias was naturally connected with Syria, and was conquered by Sargon of Assyria; but the extent to which the Phoenicians settled in the land is very doubtful, though some names and cults would seem to show their influence. Strabo, 668, seems to have had a fuller text of H. before him. sup. and iii. 91. 1 n. In accordance with this legend most of the Greek settlements in Pamphylia were believed to be Argive, though Side was colonized from Cyme. The Greek settlers there forgot their own tongue and spoke a barbarous dialect (Arrian, Anab. i. 26). Cut off from Hellenism, they were gradually assimilated by the neighbouring Pisidian and barbaric tribes. So the legends on the (later) coins of Aspendus, Perga and Side are Pamphylian not Greek (Head, H. N. 700). pi/lousktl. The feathered cap is characteristic of the peoples of the sea (among them the Lycians) who invaded Egypt in the days of Meneptah and Rameses III; cf. App. X. 8; W. Max M\u00fcller, Asien und Europa, p. 362 f. dre/pana: the Carian weapon; cf. ch. 93; v. 112. 2.

For the meaning of the phrase cf. v. 36. 4 n.; Introduction, p. 51. *)axaii/hn. For this tradition cf. i. 145 n. Why Danaus, who settled in Argos, is here mentioned in connexion with Xuthus and the Ionians is obscure, especially as he would appear to be two generations later in date (cf. i. 98. 2 n.). For the legend of Xuthus cf. Paus. vii. 1. Xuthus, son of Hellen, driven from Thessaly by his brothers Aeolus and Dorus, fled to Athens, and there married Creusa, daughter of the king Erechtheus, and by her had two sons, Ion and Achaeus. After the death of Erechtheus Xuthus fled to Aegialus and died there; Achaeus regained the throne of Thessaly, while Ion married Helice, daughter of Selinus, king of Aegialus, and at his death succeeded to the throne. *pelasgoi\\ *ai)giale/es: as later *)/iwnes *ai)giale/es (Paus. vii. 1); for *ai)giale/es cf. v. 68. 2 n. For Pelasgi here and in ch. 95 cf. Appendix XV. nhsiw=tai, usually in H. a wide term, may here signify specially the Cyclades, the nhsiwtiko\\s fo/ros of the Athenian Empire. The small number of the contingent must be explained by the fact that these recently conquered Greeks (cf. vi. 31, 49, 99) were far from loyal to Persia. Indeed some fought on the Greek side (cf. viii. 46, 66). Diodorus (xi. 3) puts the islanders' contingent at fifty ships. *pelasgiko/n. H. apparently forgets that many of the Aegean islands, e.g. Thera (iv. 147), Melos (viii. 48), were Doric. The islands close to Asia Minor are probably to be included in the Ionian, Dorian, and Aeolic, contingents. u(/steron: lo/gon, 'on the same grounds as.' The criteria that they came from Athens and celebrated the Apaturia (i. 147) applied to these islanders as much as the Ionians of the Dodecapolis, whose claims to be the only true Ionians H. vigorously disputes (i. 143 f.). On the origin of the Aeolians cf. an ancient home of the Pelasgi; cf. Pelasgiotis, Pelasgic sense (cf. iv. 38. 2 n.; v. 1. 1); apparently e)k tou= ix. 115 ad fin., and Madytus) are not mentioned probably because they are included in the Aeolians (\u00a7 1). e)peba/teuon: besides the e)pixw/rioi e)piba/tai (cf. 184 n.). The sen tence reads like a later insertion as it breaks the connexion; cf. tou/twn and tou/toisi. e)ce/rgomai: naturally 'I am precluded from', negative, as apparently in ix. 111. 1, 'prevented from refusing by the custom,' has here positive force, 'I am constrained by' (cf. ch. 139), and is equivalent to e)canagka/zomai (ii. 3. 2, cf. ch. 99. 1). e)s i(stori/hs lo/gon, 'for the purpose of my history.' Here only in H. does i(stori/h bear the meaning history which later became common. To avoid this Macan would translate, 'I am not compelled by the necessity of my argument to give any account of my inquiries on that head.' e)pa/cioi, 'worthy of mention'; cf. 224. 1; ii. 79. 1 n. So the strathgoi/ of the whole army and the a)/rxontes of the tribal contingents are distinguished in ch. 82. On the four admirals and their squadrons cf. Appendix XIX. 2. For Aspathines cf. iii. 70. 1 n. Probably this Prexaspes is grandson of the executioner of Smerdis, who revealed the deceit of the Magi (iii. 74, 75). *megaba/tew: cf. v. 32. *)axaime/nhs: cf. iii. 124 and ch. 236. *)ariabi/gnhs fell at Salamis (viii. 89). He is son of the daughter of Gobryas mentioned ch. 3. 2. The numbers of transports and light vessels seem out of place here. For the Persian custom of ruling by vassal-kings of the old royal race cf. iii. 15. 2 n. These kings (cf. viii. 11, 67) appear elsewhere at the head of their contingents; under Conon at Cnidus, 394 B.C. (cf. Diodorus, xiv. 79), and in the Aegean, 332 B.C., Autophradates 13). *tetra/mnhstos: a Phoenician name Hellenized on the analogy of *)ari/mnhstos (ix. 64. 2, 72. 2), *polu/mnhstos (iv. 150. 2). *matth/n = Mattan = a gift, Hebrew and Phoenician (2 Kings xi. 18). *sirw/mou = Hiram, LXX. *xeira/m, probably a shortened form of Ahiram = brother of the exalted one. Hiram III was a member of the ancient royal family of Tyre which had been taken captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He succeeded his brother Merb\u00e2l on the throne of his fathers 551 B.C., and reigned as a vassal first of Babylon and then of Persia till 532 B.C. *me/rbalos = Merb\u00e2l, Latin Maharbal, 'gift of Baal.' Aradus (cf. Strabo 753, 754) lay on an island like Tyre and Sidon, next to which it ranked at this time. *sue/nnesis: cf. i. 74. 3 n. According to Aeschylus, Pers. 326-8, he fell with the greatest glory at Salamis. *kuberni/skos. E. Meyer (iii, \u00a7 95 n.) reads *ku/bernis *kossi/ka. The name *ku/bernis appearing on a later inscription (Hicks1 161) and *k*u*b on early coins (Six), while *kossi/kas = Lyc. Cheziga. *go/rgos: king of Salamis (viii. 11), who remained true to Persia when Cyprus revolted (v. 104, 115). *(istiai=os: no doubt restored to the lordship of Termera (cf. v. 37) after the Ionic revolt. *damasi/qumos: lord of the city Calynda (i. 172. 2; viii. 87. 2). For its site cf. J. H. S. xv. 97. Two more leaders are mentioned in ch. 195, one Cypriot, the other Carian. strateusame/nhs. That Artemisia took part in the expedition was the more remarkable as she had a son of an age to serve (nehni/hs and might have stayed at home to safeguard her throne. On the dynasty cf. Introd. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3. *ni/suros: a small volcanic island just south of Cos. *kaludni/wn. The island *ka/ludna or *ka/lumna (the latter form is the commoner, e.g. in Inscriptions, perhaps to distinguish it from the town *ka/lunda; cf. i. 172. 2; viii. 87. 2) is north of Cos, between Cos and Leros. gnw/mas a)ri/stas: cf. viii. 68 f., 101 f. a)pofai/nw, 'I declare' (cf. ii. 16. 1). As a Halicarnassian himself H. speaks confidently. The ascription of the foundation of Halicarnassus to Troezen seems to rest on the family tradition of the *)anqea/dai, who held by right of birth the priesthood at the Posidonion (C.I.G. 2655) and claimed descent from Anthes, son of Poseidon. Strabo (656) attributes the Halicarnassus certainly honoured Troezen as its mother-city (Paus. ii. 32. 6), but the connexion does not prove Dorism, both cities being half Ionic. A bond of connexion between Epidaurus and Cos may be found in their devotion to the worship of Asclepius, under the charge of the Asclepiads, among them Hippocrates (Plato, Phaedr. 270 C, Prot. 311 B). Apparently before the Dorian immigration Cos had already been colonized from Thessaly (Il. ii. 676 f.; Tac. Ann. xii. 61). Calymna and Nisyros were later occupied from Cos (Diod. v. 54). Xerxes talks with Demaratus. The feats of Boges and Mascames. The conversations with Demaratus illustrate the confidence of Xerxes (ch. 101, 209) and contrast the servile subjects of the 'great king' with the Greeks, whose watchwords, 'freedom under the law' and 'loyalty to 5), anticipate Thermopylae. a)pe/grafon oi( grammatistai/: cf. viii. 90. 4. That such lists existed is certain (cf. App.), but in supposing they were first made at Doriscus, H. sacrifices truth to picturesqueness. ne/a *sidwni/hn: cf. ch. 128. 2. The Sidonian ships and crews were the best in the fleet (ch. 44 ad fin., 96. 1, 99. 3). Sidon at this time outstripped Tyre in trade (Meyer, iii, \u00a7 85); her king took precedence of the Tyrian in the council of war (viii. 67). e)nto/s: i.e. inside the line of ships between them and the shore. mh\\ e)o/ntes = ei) mh\\ ei)/hsan. Modifying a)/rqmioi, 'united, leagued together'; cf. vi. 83. 2; ix. 9. 2, 37. 4; Hom. Od. xvi. 427. mh/ is used with a(lw/setai because the relative has the force of a consecutive clause; cf. iv. 166. 1. su/ntrofos: specially of congenital citizen body (L. & S.) rather than the 'constitution of the state' (Stein). kata\\ no/mous. Xerxes, with a knowledge of improbable exactitude, alludes to the Spartan kings' double portion at feasts (vi. 57. 1 and 3); double service might therefore be expected of them. Xerxes pictures a battle as a number of isolated combats in which each Spartan will be surrounded by a thousand Persians. But five million Persians is a great exaggeration on the author's own reckoning (ch. 185), unless the camp followers be included (ch. 186). For the Spartans' numbers cf. ch. 234. 2 n. ta\\ kath/konta: how it is with the Spartans; cf. i. 97. 2. ta\\ nu=n ta/de e)storgw\\s e)kei/nous, as the text stands, must sarcastic; 'how I now chance to love them,' e)kei/nous being governed by e)storgw/s (cf. ix. 113. 2) and ta\\ nu=n ta/de adverbial. Stein, however, conjectures that a participle, a)postuge/wn has fallen out after e)kei/nous, and construes 'how well pleased I am with my present condition (cf. ste/rgein ma/listainfr.). and honours.' For the ge/rea cf. vi. 56 f., and for the deposition vi. 61-70. ou)de\\n Doriscus, though not mentioned since ch. 59, is the scene of the review and of the conversation with Demaratus (cf. i. 120. 1; vi. 42. 1). a)/ndra toio/nde geno/menon. These words give not a reason for Xerxes' action, but a later reflection of the author 'Mascames, left in charge by Xerxes, so bore himself that', toio/nde being explained by the relative clause; cf. i. 202. 2. pa/ntwn: i.e. in Thrace and on the Hellespont as stated in \u00a7 2. *maskamei/oisi: a patronymic rare in Prose, but cf. Plato, Gorg. 482 A o( *kleini/eios ou(=tos. *(ellhspo/ntou depends on pantaxh=| (cf. ch. 126) = in all the strong places such as Sestos (ch. 33). e)caire/qhsan, 'were driven out'; e.g. from Sestos (ix. 118) 478 B.C. spring, Byzantium (Thuc. i. 94. 128) 478 B.C. autumn, Eion (ch. 107) 476-475 winter, and later, apparently after the battle of Eurymedon, from the Thracian Chersonese (Plut. Cim. 14; C. I. A. i. 432). The many attempts to drive out Mascames show the length of these operations. The whole passage indicates that Mascames died in possession of Doriscus, but that it was later lost to Persia. As there is no sign that it ever fell into the hands of Athens, K\u00f6hler (Hermes, xxiv. 89) conjectures that the Thracians took it. The fact that Artaxerxes sent the gifts to the descendants of Mascames shows that Mascames must have died after his accession (465 B.C.). oi( pe/mpetai. H. writes loosely in speaking as if the gifts were still sent to Mascames; really the gifts, originally sent to him, were continued to his descendants. *)hio/nos: on the Strymon (ch. 25 ad fin.). The taking of Eion was the first achievement of the allied fleet under Athenian leadership (Diod. xi. 60; Thuc. i. 98). The siege began apparently in the summer of 476, and lasted to the spring of 475. fire cf. i. 86 n.) This account is supported by the inscriptions on Hermae quoted by Plutarch and Aeschines in Ctes. 183. On the other hand, the division of the river, the stratagem ascribed to Cimon (Paus. viii. 8. 9), is probably a later invention, explaining the inscription (Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff, A. and A., i. 156 n.; Meyer, F. ii. 61). The region was rich in precious metals; cf. v. 17; vi. 46; vii. 112; ix. 75. The advance of the army and fleet from Doriscus to Therma. Anecdotes of the feeding of the host. kai\\ pro/teron: cf. v. 1 f.; vi. 44 f. me/xri *qessali/hs dasmofo/ros. The country, including Macedon (cf. vi. 44. 1), was subject and tributary, though under native princes. *megaba/zou: cf. iv. 143. 1. ta\\ *samoqrhi/kia tei/xea: forts securing for Samothrace a strip of the island; cf. ch. 59. 2; similarly Thasos (ch. 109. 2 n.; vi. 46. 2 n.; vi. 33. 1); and in Asia, Chios (i. 160) and Lesbos (v. 94; Thuc. iii. 50, iv. 52). *mesambri/h: perhaps at Tekieh, to be distinguished from the town on the Euxine (iv. 93. 1; vi. 33. 2). *li/sos. The only river of any size passes through Dede-Agatch (Doriscus?), but there is a smaller stream near Cape Makri (Serreion), which may be the Lisus. *gallai+kh/. *galai=oi are mentioned in Thrace on the Athenian tribute lists (Hicks, 48, 64). *briantikh/: Liv. xxxviii. 41 as Doriscus (ch. 109. 'just title' of the Cicones (cf. ch. 59. 3 n.) is no doubt the earliest mention of Ismarus in Homer, Od. ix. 39. *marw/neia: colonized by Chians Chius, 197; Plin. xiv. 53 f.), after the Ciconian town Ismarus (Od. ix. 40). There is now no lake between Stryme and Maroneia. Ismaris is placed by Kiepert in the marshes west of Maroneia. *bistoni/da, named after the Bistones (Scym. Ch. l. 674), is really a lagoon (Buru Gyul) connected with the sea. *trau=os: perhaps better *trau=sos as the inhabitants are *trau=soi (v. 4), the Yardymly Dereh. *ko/myatos: Ael. H. A. xv. 25 *kossi/nitos; in the Antonine Itinerary, Cosintus; it now reaches the sea a little west of the Buru Gyul. *)/abdhra: cf. i. 168 n.; usually placed, after Ptolemy, ten miles east of the Nestus, though Scylax (Peripl, 68) and Strabo (331, fr. 46) imply a site just east of the river, as apparently does H. (ch. 126). There are now no ruins near the mouth of the river Nestus (Kara Su). *qasi/wn (cf. ch. 118) must be read for the meaningless i)w/n, otherwise they are paraqalassi/as (\u00a7 2), but cities on the mainland in opposition to the islands, Thasos and Samothrace (cf. i. 151, of the cities of Aeolis). *pi/sturos. The name is connected with *bi/stones; cf. 108. 3 n. for the change of b to p. The form *kusti/rioi appears on a quota list, C. I. A. i. 243. The place may be marked by a salt-lake ten miles from the Nestus. For Xerxes' route cf. ch. 121 n. The tribes are enumerated roughly from east to west. *pai=toi: near the mouth of the Hebrus; cf. Arrian, Anab. i. 11. 4. *ki/kones: near Mount Ismarus; cf. 59. 3, 108. 3 n. *sapai=oi (cf. Appian, B.C. iv. 105): east of Philippi (Daton) and opposite Thasos. *dersai=oi (cf. Thuc. ii. 101): apparently an inland tribe north of the Sapaei. *)hdwnoi/: reaching to the Strymon (v. 11. 2 n.; vii. 114. 1; ix. 75). They had once dwelt between the Axius and the Strymon in Mygdonia, but had been driven thence by the Macedonian kings (Thuc. ii. 99). *sa/trai: in the hill country behind the Edonians between the Nestus and the Strymon. mou=noi *qrhi/kwn is too strong, even though Darius nominally made the country subject (iv. 93), and the Odrysian princes dominated most of the tribes (Thuc. ii. 95-7). The Odrysae at least were free and powerful; cf. iv. 80. *dionu/sou: cf. v. 7 n. The empire of Augustus over the world was foreshown by a portenthere, as had been that of Alexander (Suet. Aug. 94). *bhssoi/, or *bessoi/, were, according to Strabo (318), a race of mountain robbers, stretching from Mount Rhodope to the Illyrian frontier. Livy (xxxix. 53) and Pliny (H. N. iv. 40) also regard them as a distinct race. They retained the custody of the oracle till it was transferred to the Odrysae by Crassus in 29 B.C. (Dio Cass. li. 25). Possibly (Macan) the name of the religious order (Bessi) superseded the tribal name, Satrae. oi( profhteu/ontes: that is the class from whom the profh/ths came. The profh/ths is the interpreter of the meaning of the god; if the oracle be given by dreams or signs, he explains their significance; if by speech, he puts together as an ordered whole the cries which the pro/mantis lets fall in her state of ecstasy. He stands between the god and the people (cf. Pind. fr. 118 manteu/eo *moi=sa profateu/sw d' e)gw/), and is the president and manager of the temple. Cf. viii. 36 ad fin., 37, and for pro/mantisad init. vi. 66. 2; vii. 141. 2; i. 47 n. H. seems to use the two words indifferently in viii. 135. 2 and 3. These priests living in retirement in caves seem to have received almost divine honours in Thrace, and to have had great political Rhesus 970; Strabo The priestess gives answers just as at Delphi; there is nothing more extraordinary about it. Apparently there were exaggerated notions current in Greece about this oracle of Dionysus. H., jealous for the honour of Delphi (cf. i. 48), declares it is just an ordinary oracle, using the same means as Delphi, not dreams, omens or the lot. For Xerxes' route cf. ch. 121 n. The Pierians, like the Edones (ch. 110) and the Bottiaei, were driven from their homes in Macedonia, just north of Mount Olympus (cf. ch. 131), by their old home. *fa/grhs: the first place east of the Strymon's mouth river lying between its tributary the Angites and the sea; cf. v. 16. 1. *)odo/mantoi: cf. v. 16. 1 n. *do/bhras: west of the Sapaean pass, on the left bank of the Angites, between Philippi and Amphipolis, to be distinguished from the larger Paeonian tribe in the land. Doberus, between the upper Axius and the Strymon (Thuc. ii. 98). *paio/plai: cf. v. 15. 3 n. H.'s orientation is, as often, loose. He seems to conceive the Strymon as flowing from west to east, and the Angites as flowing into it from the north, but really the Strymon here flows from north-west to south-east and the Angites joins it from the north-east. H., by making the Angites flow into the Strymon not into a lake, implies that Lake Cercinitis did not then exist, or was of small importance; similarly Thucydides (ii. 98) ignores it, and only speaks of to\\ limnw=des tou= *strumo/nos (v. 7). It is first clearly mentioned by Arrian (i. 11. 3), and has apparently increased in size greatly since ancient times (Kiepert, Map XVI, p. 4). kallire/esqai: to offer sacrifice in order to learn the will of the gods (vi. 82. 2; vii. 167. 1); the active kallire/ein (impersonal in H.) is used of the sacrifice itself = xrhsta\\ gi/nesqai, vi. 76. 2; vii. 134. 2; ix. 19. 2, 38. 2, 96. 1. The offering of a horse is genuinely Persian (i. 133. 1; Tac. Ann. vi. 37; Xen. Anab. iv. 5. 35), and water, especially running water, was sacred (i, 131. 2, 138. 2 n.); but Strabo (732) says that when the Persians come to a stream or spring, they dig a pit, and there sacrifice their victim, taking care that the pure water near them is not stained with the blood, since that would be pollution. It would seem then that if H. is right, the Magi were following not Persian but local custom (cf. vi. 97. 2; vii. 43. 2; viii. 133; ix. 37. 1). The Strymon received divine honours from Greeks; cf. rivers cf. vi. 76; viii. 138. 1, and especially of the river Scamander secret rites, spells, or incantations which accompanied the sacrifice (i. 132. 3), which made the Greeks use the word ma/gos for 'wizard' (Soph. Oed. stades up stream from Eion, where the Athenians built Amphipolis in 437 B.C. For the bridge cf. ch. 24. *persiko/n. Human sacrifice is certainly not Zoroastrian, nor does it seem to have been common in Persia, though there are the instances of Cambyses (iii. 35. 5), Parysatis (Ctes. Pers. 55, p. 77), and another of Amestris (Ctes. Pers. 41, p. 74). For human sacrifice among the tribes north of Thrace cf. iv. 62, 73, 93. punqa/nomai. This note is clearly a later addition. It is usually dated very late, since Ctesias (Pers. 43, p. 75) puts the death of Amestris in extreme old age shortly before that of Artaxerxes (425 B.C.). This, however, proves nothing. Amestris (cf. ix. 112), as daughter of Otanes and chief wife of Xerxes, was probably born some years before 500 B.C.; hence she would be for an Eastern woman old any time after 440 B.C. The story may have come from Zopyrus (J. H. S. xxvii. 37 f.). tw=| qew=|: cf. ii. 122. 1. Ahriman, the opponent of Ormuzd, resembles Hades as being author of death, and dwelling in hell beneath with his legions. *)/argilon. Like Stagirus and Acanthus an Andrian colony (Thuc. iv. 84, 88, 103). *bisalti/h. The Bisaltae, though conquered by Macedon (Thuc. ii. 99), preserved their nationality for centuries (Liv. xlv. 29, 30). They were famed for bravery; cf. viii. 116. *sule/os pedi/ou. Apparently the valley through which the waters of Lake Bolbe reach the sea (Thuc. iv. 103); probably Xerxes marched up this valley and then by Lerigova, not along the coast (cf. W. F. Anderson in Papers of the University College, Sheffield, 1897). Syleus was a son of Poseidon (cf. *posidhi/on), slain by Heracles for mishandling strangers (Apoll. ii. 6. 3). *sta/giron has been placed at Nisvoro (Bowen) and at Stavros (Leake), but the identifications are quite uncertain (Anderson, op. cit. p. 226). *)/akanqos: Hierissos; a most important station, as in the expedition of Mardonius (vi. 44. 2). It has an excellent harbour, giving shelter in all weathers, an advantage not found elsewhere on this coast (Anderson, op. cit. p. 221). o(moi/ws 110. This vetus via regia was still in use 185 B.C. (Liv. xxxix. 27). No doubt the well-made Persian road (cf. v. 52) was a precious possession to the inhabitants. ceini/hn proei=te: not here 'imperavit hospitia' (cf. ch. 119. 1, 120. 2), but declared them his sworn friends, as is shown by the context and by ch. 29. 2; viii. 120. e)sqh=ti *mhdikh=|: must be excised (Kr\u00fcger) or emended (Hude), or (2) something must be inserted, e.g. (Gomperz Stud. Her. ii. 65) speu/dontas before a)kou/wn. The Acanthians naturally took part in digging the canal (ch. 22). Artachaees was eight feet high, the ideal height being but four cubits (Ar. Frogs, 1014; cf. i. 60. 4). Respect for mere size is an oriental characteristic (ch. 187. 2; 1 Sam. ix. 2); thus the Mamelukes wondered at Napoleon's shortness. Though the identification of the tumulus (Spratt, Journ. R. G. S. xvii. 149) is very doubtful, there is no reason to suspect the real existence of Artachaees. H. is not embodying a mythical figure (Winckler, Gesch. Israels, ii. 175), nor borrowing from Alcaeus (Diels, xxii. 425). w(s h(/rwi: cf. v. iv. 35. 3. o(/kou ge, 'seeing that,' 68. 2. h)pei/rw|: cf. ch. 109. 2, 108. 2. a)rairhme/nos: chosen to provide the banquet. In performing this 'Liturgy' he was probably expected to assist the State out of his own pocket. For the wealth of Thasos cf. vi. 46 n. tetrako/sia. Athenaeus (iv. 146 C), quoting Ctesias (fr. 11, p. 227) and Deinon (fr. 19, F. H. G. ii. 93), gives the same estimate for the cost of the king's supper, and puts the number of his guests at fifteen thousand. Heraclides of Cyme (fr. 2, F. H. G. ii. 96; ap. Athen. iv. 145 B) says this seems very magnificent, but is really economical, since this maintenance is really part of the pay of the king's guards and retinue. For eating of the king's meat cf. Daniel i. 5, 8, 13 f., and of his salt Ezra iv. 24; Meyer iii, \u00a7 54. These details as to 'Purveyance' in the Persian empire are very significant. Cf. the frequent complaints of this method of exaction in mediaeval England. pare/xein a)/n: imperfect = would have had to choose.' *qe/rmh|. Perhaps a Greek colony, yet always, save for a few months (Thuc. i. 61; ii. 29), a Macedonian town. It became of great importance when Cassander founded there (in 305 B.C.) Thessalonica (Strabo 330, fr. 24), a city as great in Roman times (Liv. xlv. 30; Acts ch. xvii) as it still is as Saloniki. Kiepert (Map XVI, p. 3) would, however, place Therma six miles south-east of Thessalonica. tau/th|, 'because the way by this town was he learned the shortest'; cf. iv. 86. 3; v. 17. 2. The division of the army of Xerxes into three columns (cf. ch. 131) and the account here given, imply a march by three routes, at least from Doriscus to Acanthus, and in all probability to Therma (ch. 124 n.). But it is not easy to find in the actual narrative more than two separate routes. In ch. 110 it seems clear that the centre under Xerxes went a little inland by the route later famous as the Via Egnatia, while the left column followed the coast. H., however, does not realize that the left column, unless it was ferried across Lake Bistonis, must have returned to the Via Egnatia at the head of the lagoon, and in any case must have done so at Neapolis. After Neapolis the left column clearly marched south of Mount Pangaeum, while another must have followed, as did the Via Egnatia, the valley of the Angites, north of Mount Pangaeum. The third column presents a difficulty. W. F. Anderson, Papers of the University College of Sheffield (1897), ingeniously accounts for its disappearance by suggesting (p. 250) that it had already marched from Doriscus right up the Hebrus, and that it only rejoined Xerxes at Therma by the valley of the Axius (ch. 124 n.). Macan, arguing that no third route is indicated by H. between Doriscus and Acanthus, suggests that the third division was on board the fleet. Thus Xerxes might march along the coast (ch. 113) and yet be with the centre column (ch. 121). On the other hand, the confusion of routes in ch. 124 makes it more probable that a part of the army marched far inland by the Upper Strymon and Echeidorus. Clearly H. is right in his view that the Persian army marched by more than one route, but he has not succeeded in keeping the different columns and routes distinct. For the generals in command of the columns cf. ch. 82. die/xousan, 'reaching through to'; cf. iv. 48. 2. On the canal and its completion cf. ch. 23 n. *)/assa: at the head of the gulf; on the Attic tribute lists *)/asshra (Hicks, 33, 48). *si/ggos: the only important town mentioned gave its name to the gulf (Thuc. v. 18; Plin. iv. 37). a)pie/menos paramei/beto: apparently the main fleet after rounding Cape Ampelus, near Torone, sailed straight across (123. 1) the Gulf of Torone, leaving the cities on its right (cf. ch. 42. 1, 109. 1); but it may well have sent a detachment to pick up their contingents. H.'s statement, though loose, is quite intelligible. *torw/nh lay near the mouth of the gulf and had an excellent harbour (Liv. xlv. 30), while Sermylia (now Hormylia) was near the inmost recess. This Galepsus, unless H. has blundered, must have been between the two, and cannot be the better known Thasian colony near the Strymon, for which cf. Thuc. iv. v. 6; and Strabo 331, (Molivo) was taken by the Olynthians (Thuc. v. 39) and became their port (Strabo 331, fr. 29). For Olynthus cf. viii. 127 n. sunta/mnwn (sc.th\\n o(do/n) (cf. loosely to cf. iv. 23. 3; v. 92 a. *potidei/hs *qera/mbw. On the east side of Pallene, on the Gulf of Torone; only Potidaea on the Isthmus also had a harbour on the Thermaic gulf, and was of importance (Thuc. i. 56 f.). Aphytis is Phormio's base against Potidaea (Thuc. i. 64). *qera/mbw. On Attic tribute lists *qra/mbaioi is often coupled with Scione (cf. C. I. A. i. 227, 229, 237). *skiw/nhs *sa/nhs: cf. Strabo 330, fr. 27; on the west side of the peninsula. Scione, a colony from Pellene in Achaia (Thuc. iv. 120), and Mende, an Eretrian colony just east of Cape Posideum (Thuc. iv. 123, 129), both suffered greatly in the Peloponnesian war (Thuc. iv. 130 f.; v. 32). On Sane cf. ch. 22. 3. kaleome/nhn: i.e. in epic it was taken as the site of the battle between the gods and the giants, *fle/gra being connected with fle/gein, as were the Campi Phlegraei in Campania (Polyb. iii. 91. 7), and for the same reason, the volcanic character of the country. *ai)/neia is the only town of any importance (Liv. xliv. 10. 32). *mugdoni/hn: east of the Lower Axius as far as Lake Bolbe (Thuc. i. 58; ii. 99). *si/ndon: prob. at the mouth of the Echeidorus. *xale/strhn: elsewhere *xala/stra, at the mouth of the Axius (Strabo 330, fr. 21). *bottiaii/s, or *botti/a, a land called after its earlier inhabitants, driven by the Macedonians into Chalcidice (viii. 127. 1; Thuc. ii. 99); it lay between the lower courses of the Axius and the Haliacmon (ch. 127. 1). The small wedge-shaped plain coming down to the sea was divided between Ichnae and Pella. The latter, under Philip capital of Macedon, lay 120 stades from the short way across the land.' This curious phrase, repeated in ix. 89. 4, is perhaps colloquial. Both ta/mnein me/shn o(do/n and me/shn gh=n would mean to way; hence phrases like ta\\ su/ntoma th=s o(dou= (i. 185. 7; iv. 136. 2) are natural, as again is vii. 121. 3 h)/ie . . . th\\n meso/gaian. Here we seem to have a confusion of the two expressions; cf. iv. 12. 3 e)s meso/gaian th=s o(dou= trafqe/ntes. *paionikh=s. The Siriopaeones (v. lived just above Lake Cercinitis on the Strymon and other Paeonians near the source of that river. Crestonia or Grestonia (Thuc. ii. 99, 100) is the hilly country round the source of the Cheidorus, or Echeidorus (now Galliko), and the upper valley of that river. This, of course, is far from the shortest route from Acanthus to Therma. H. probably distorted the whole lie of the country, exaggerating the size of Chalcidice and shortening the inland distances by a misconception as to the direction of the rivers (ch. 113 n.). He also confused the route of the three columns. In fact only a detachment can have gone with Xerxes to Acanthus which is off the line: one column doubtless marched along the road by Apollonia and Lake Bolbe (cf. Aesch. Pers. 494 for the return), another probably went inland by the Upper Strymon and the sources of the Echeidorus, and so down the Axius (ch. 121 n.). bo/es a)/grioi: since their horns are described as immense, these would seem to be the uri of Caesar (B. G. vi. 28), the aurochs. Though these long-horned oxen were found chiefly in Western Europe, they are represented as caught in nets on the Vaphio cups. Again, Trajan dedicated to Jupiter Casius the horn of an urus which formed part of the booty won from the Getae (Anth. Pal. vi. 332). The Bonasus of Aristotle (H. A. ix. 45, 630 a), the bison of Seneca (Phaedr. 69; Paus. x. 13), &c., had comparatively short horns, and a long shaggy mane of hair on its neck and breast; it was found in Paeonia as well as Western Europe (cf. Keller, Thiere des klassischen Altertums, pp. 53-65). foite/onta: coming as articles of commerce, iii. 115. 1; vii. 23. 4. For H.'s interest in trade cf. Introduction, \u00a7 15. toi=si le/ousi. The view that lions existed at that time in Europe has been ridiculed by Colonel Mure (Lit. of Greece, iv. 402), but H.'s statement is precise, and is repeated by Aristotle, a native of the district (H. A. vi. 31, 519 a), and by Pliny (H. N. viii. 45; cf. also Paus. vi. 5. 4, 5), while Dio Chrysostom (Orat. xxi, p. 269 c) says that by his time (A. D. 120) lions had disappeared from Europe. Fossils of lions are found in Europe, but they are of prehistoric date. di) *)abdh/rwn: for the site of Abdera cf. ch. 109. 1 n., but H. may mean only the territory of Abdera; cf. i. 15 e)s *mi/lhto/n 20 ad fin.). e)/mprosqe. To speak of the east as the front of Europe would only be natural to an Asiatic, but H. might use the expression (1) from early associations, or (2) because he is following an Asiatic source. The expression does not prove that he was actually writing in Asia. *ludi/hs (also *loudi/as and *loidi/as) is the Karasmak or Mavronero from Almopia through lake Borborus. *(alia/kmwn is the Vistritza, rising in Orestis. At present the Lydias joins the Axius (Vardhar) near its mouth. From the time of Scylax (550 B.C.) to that of Ptolemy (A. D. 140) all three streams seem to have had distinct mouths (Scylax, Periplus 67; Strabo 330, fr. 20; Ptolemy, iii. 12 f.). In alluvial plains and marshes (as e.g. Babylonia) such changes in the courses of rivers are frequent. oi(\\ ou)ri/zousi: i.e. after their union; further up the Lydias was the boundary. *makedoni/da: the supposed original home of the Macedonians, to be distinguished from the wider term *makedoni/h (v. 17. 2, &c.). It includes only the original principality of the Temenid house (cf. viii. 138. 2), i.e. the plain between the Haliacmon and the Axius with the spurs of Mount Bermius; its capital is Edessa or Aegae. With Pieria and Bottiaea it is called (ch. 173. 1) h( ka/tw *makedoni/h in contrast with h( a)/nw *makedoni/h (ch. 128. 1, 173. 4), yet apparently this upper country was the home of the true Macedonians (cf. Thuc. ii. 99). The king's visit to Tempe. With Xerxes' desire to see the vale of Tempe we may compare Darius' visit to the Cyanean rocks (iv. 85). His march would not bring him into the neighbourhood of Tempe (cf. infr.). There are three roads from lower Macedonia into Thessaly. (1) East of Mount Olympus along the coast to the mouth of the Peneius, and up that river to Gonnus through the pass of Tempe; (2) through the depression between western Olympus and the Pierian hills, called the pass of Petra, leading to the sources of the river Europus or Titaresius, and down that river through Perrhaebia; (3) making a much longer circuit round the mountains up the valley of the Haliacmon, and then turning south-east through a deep cleft in the Cambunian Mountains (the pass of Volustana or Servia) to the upper valley of the Titaresius. There is also a difficult mountain path over southern Olympus from Heracleum to Lake Ascuris near Lapathus, descending xxxvi. 10; xlii. 54. 67. H. would appear to have imagined there was only one pass besides Tempe (cf. 173. 4), but if so his account is confused. The repeated emphasis on para\\ *go/nnon po/lin (128. 1, 173. 4), and the great labour involved in cutting a road (ch. 131), point to the mountain path (cf. Liv. xliv. 3 'ardua et aspera et confragosa via fuit'; cf. ib. 5), but it is hard to see how a route so difficult and easily blocked could be described as a)sfale/staton (cf. inf.), or could possibly have been used by the whole Persian army (ch. 151. 1, 173. 4). Again, the expressions e)s *perraibou/s, dia\\ *perraibw=n (131. 1, 173. 4), though possible of the mountain path, are more appropriate of the two other passes, since after crossing the passes of Volustana and Petra a force coming from Macedonia to Oloosson (Elassona) has still to traverse the lower passes of Perrhaebia, i.e. the region between Mount Pindus and the Peneius, south of Tripolis, to which in 480 B.C. the Perrhaebi were confined. Again, the phrases oi( *makedo/nes oi( katu/perqe oi)khme/noi, h( a)/nw *makedoni/h (cf. 127 n., 173. 4) apply properly to the mountain regions of Orestis, Lyncestis and Elimia. The Persians would not reach even the nearest of these districts Elimia unless they went round by the pass of Volustana (cf. Liv. xlii. Further, if Xerxes intended to march by the mountain path which led to Gonnus close to Tempe, why did he make a special excursion to it from Therma? On the whole it would seem almost certain that Xerxes must have used the easier passes of Volustana and Petra for his main force, though a detachment may have gone by the mountain path. The mountain path as the shortest circuit would naturally be used in turning the position of a force holding Tempe (cf. ch. 173), as the Anopaea path was at Thermopylae, and would therefore be the best known. Its fame may have obscured the existence of the more distant passes. a)sfale/staton, 'the safest way.' The way along the marshy strip of coastland and through the narrow cleft of Tempe could be easily held by an enemy (Livy xliv. 6), and presented many difficulties for a large army even if undefended (cf. ch. 173). Even if the mountain path were also used, the exit from it and from Tempe might be closed by holding Gonnus (Liv. xxxvi. omits the Titaresius or Europus, the most important tributary of the Peneius on its left side, either from forgetfulness or because it belongs to Perrhaebia (ch. 128 n.), and inserts the obscure Onochonus (196) between the Apidanus and Enipeus, which certainly belong together (ch. 196 n.). The Pamisus is the modern Phanari, or Piliuri, flowing from Southern Pindus, the Peneius, the main river, is the Salambria. Probably H. knew well the lower course of the river through Tempe, but not the upper courses of the tributary streams. H. wishes to emphasize the fact that all these streams pour their waters through one narrow outlet (the vale of Tempe) into the sea, and at first speaks as if they still retained their separate names till they reached Tempe; he then (\u00a7 3) corrects this by pointing out that they lose their individual names when they join the main stream of Peneius. *boibhi/da: the modern lake of Karla, on the western boundary of Magnesia, in a deep depression closed on three sides by hills; it is fed chiefly by overflow from the Peneius. When that river is much swollen, its waters find their way by a channel below Larissa into Lake Nessonis (now Karatjair), and thence by the river Asmak to the lake of Karla. oi)ko/ta: the view is consistent and reasonable (cf. iii. 111. 1; vii. 167. 1), but H. leaves the intervention of the Deity an open question, he does not himself adopt the opinion of the pious believers in Poseidon (cf. Introduction, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 32). Philostratus (Imag. ii. 17) finds the best proof that the cleft was made by an earthquake in the zigzag shape of the cliffs. The ups and downs on either side the valley correspond closely to each other, and the rocks are of the same kind and appearance. Modern geologists would agree with H., except that they might substitute a series of volcanic movements for a single earthquake. H. is at his best in such questions of geology and physical geography (cf. ii. 10-12). tau=ta. Lest it should be thought that the conformation of their land was the only reason for the Thessalians' submission, kai\\ ta)=lla (e.g. my might) is added, and then tau=ta a)/ra is resumed and explained by o(/ti a)/ra cf. ch. 35. 2). pro\\ pollou=: as a matter of fact the Thessalians had only finally 'come to a better mind' at the very last moment, when deserted by the other Greeks (ch. 172, 174), but Xerxes believed that they had been the first to invite his intervention (\u00a7 3). e)pei=nai: immittere; cf. ch. 176. 4. The whole anecdote gives a striking picture of the geography of Thessaly, with its flat central plain walled in by mountains. Return of the Heralds. List of the Greeks who Medized. Story of Sperchias and Bulis. *pieri/hn. The small strip of coastland between the mouths of the Haliacmon and Peneius, with the well-wooded hill country on the right bank of the Haliacmon below the Cambunian Mountains, and the northern and eastern slopes of Mount Olympus, was called Pieria after its early inhabitants (*pi/eres, cf. ch. 112), though later included in lower Macedonia (ch. 127. 1). Hence the Pierian hills are here called o)/ros *makedoniko/n. Its chief towns were Methone, Pydna, and Dium. e)/keire: compare the road made by Sitalces (Thuc. ii. 98). trithmori/s: for the triple division cf. ch. 121. *qessaloi/: in the narrow sense, the tribe that, migrating from Thesprotia (ch. 176. 4), seized the valley of the Peneius, and compelled the peoples round about to acknowledge its suzerainty, so that the whole country within the limits given in ch. 129 was called Thessaly. *do/lopes: an ancient people living in the mountain region on both sides of Mount Pindus, from the upper Achelous (Thuc. ii. 102 to Lake Xynias. They are known as early as Homer (Il. ix. 484), and remained distinct till the Roman conquest (Liv. xxxviii. 3 f.; xli. 22). South-east of them, at the north of Mount Oeta in the upper valley of the Spercheius (ch. 198. 2), were the *)enih=nes (so also Il. ii. 749) or Aenianes (Thuc. &c.), while the Malians (*mhlie/es, cf. ch. 198. 1) lived round the mouth of the Spercheius, at the western end of the Maliac Gulf, reaching as far as Thermopylae. On the coast, to the east of Thermopylae, were the Locrians (Epicnemidian and Opuntian), while in Pthiotis Mount Othrys the north dwelt the *)axaioi/ (ch. 173. 1, 196 f.), the old Hellenic stock who followed Achilles, surnamed *fqiw=tai to distinguish them from the Achaeans of Peloponnese. All these tribes belonged to the Pylaic Amphictyony (ch. 213. 2). e)/tamon o(/rkion: Homeric, probably from the cutting up of the victim; cf. iv. 201. 2, and in middle iv. 70. This famous oath, said by Diodorus (xi. 3) to have been taken by the su/nedroi assembled at the Isthmus, must either have been general in its terms, and have been directed against oi( mhdi/zontes without naming them individually, or must be placed after the battle of Thermopylae. Thebes was not openly on the Persian side till that time (ch. 205), and the Opuntian Locrians seem to have resisted till after 203. 1; viii. 1. 31. 5); even the Thessalians did not Medize till Tempe was evacuated (ch. 172). Yet the indicative o(/soi e)/dosan (not o(/soi a)\\n dw=si) would seem to refer to a definite list of states, such as that given just above. Abicht would therefore identify this oath with that said to have been sworn before the battle of Plataea (Polyb. ix. 39) and given by Diodorus (xi. 29) and Lycurgus (in Leoc. 81). But this oath before Plataea seems to be a later invention. (1) It is not mentioned by H. (2) It is attributed by Diodorus (xi. 29) to the Greeks assembled at the Isthmus, whereas the Athenians did not join the army till it reached Eleusis. (3) Theopompus (fr. 167, F. H. G. i. 306) declared it to be an Athenian invention, an assertion supported by the fact that its formula seems borrowed from the ephebic oath at Athens. (4) The clause forbidding the restoration of temples destroyed by the barbarians is most improbable. It seems better therefore to hold that the oath of the confederates, whose reality is supported by the proverbial phrase to\\ pa/lai lego/menon dekateuqh=nai *qhbai/ous (Xen. Hell. vi. 3. 20, 5. 35), was taken just before the invasion as H. and Diodorus (xi. 3. 2) state. H. may have committed a slight anachronism in giving at this point a definite list of Medizing states, and not a general formula, or possibly the Thebans and Locrians were added later to the list of the 'proscribed' made just before the invasion. If we could believe Diodorus (xi. 3), the hill-tribes\u2014i.e. the Aenianes, Dolopes, Malians, Perrhaebians, Magnetes\u2014Medized while the Greek force was still at Tempe (and so caused its withdrawal), whereas the Achaeans, Opuntian Locrians, Thessalians (proper, cf. \u00a7 1), and Boeotians only Medized when the Greeks withdrew. But the silence of H. shows that this was unknown to him. dekateu=sai cannot mean merely to exact a tithe from (Abicht, B\u00e4hr), as even if a tenth of the population was dedicated to the god, as Strabo relates of the Mysians (572) and of the Chalcidian colonists of Rhegium (257), as well as of their property, the penalty would be far milder than was usual in such cases. No doubt the original meaning of a dekateu/ein is to 'tithe' exact a tenth of goods, revenue, or produce (Xen. Anab. v. 3. 9 f.), and the most usual occasion for exacting such a tithe was the dedication to god of a tenth of the booty won in war (cf. v. 77. 4; viii. 27. 5; ix. 81. 1). Here, however, the meaning is surely the total destruction of the cities, involving the sale of the population into slavery and the confiscation of all goods and lands: from the proceeds a tenth would be dedicated to the god. This was the doom of traitors at Athens (cf. the Hermokopids, Hicks, 72; the generals condemned after Arginusae, Xen. Hell. i. 7. 10, 20); this is the procedure of Camillus at Veii (Liv. v. 21, 23, 25), and is implied in the tale of the capture of Sardis (i. 89). This seems a better way of accounting for the total confiscation implied than merely to take dekateu=sai in the vague sense = 'dedicate' (Stein). And that total destruction was vowed against the traitors can hardly be doubted; in the case of Thebes it became proverbial; cf. Polyb. ix. 39. 5; Xen. Hell. vi. nu=n e)lpi\\s to\\ pa/lai lego/menon dekateuqh=nai *qhbai/ous. This by the proposal to evict the Medizers and take their lands for the Ionians (ix. 106). Doubtless it was not carried out as most of them could shelter themselves under the proviso mh\\ a)nagkasqe/ntes, and the Aleuadae saved themselves by bribery (cf. vi. 72). a)neqe/lhton = a)/xari: cf. ch. 88. 1. Later tradition supplied this omission in H.; cf. Paus. as the tradition (Plut. Them. ch. 6) that Themistocles was responsible for the death of the interpreter Arthmius of Zeleia (cf. ix. 3. 1 n.), are clearly later embellishments of the story, due to the desire to connect famous men with a famous (or infamous) act. H. perhaps thought that Athens was destroyed as a punishment for the burning of Cybebe's temple at Sardis (v. 102). That it was the wrath of Talthybius which showed itself in the unfavourable omens may have been guessed from his function as protector of heralds, or declared by an oracle. For Talthybius cf. Hom. Il. i. 320, and for the adoption in Dorian Sparta of traditional glories from the Epics v. 67 n. i(ro/n: an h(rw=|on such as Talthybius also had in Achaean Aegae (Paus. iii. 12. 7; vii. 24. 1). The Achaean clan of the Talthybiadae must have been admitted into the Spartan community like the Cadmeian Aegidae (iv. 149. 1). For these hereditary state-heralds and other similar positions cf. vi. 60 n. tau=ta: the murder of the heralds. kallierh=sai: cf. ch. 113. 2 n. a(li/hs: any public assembly (v. 29. 2 n.); here the Spartan Apella. a)pe/pemyan. The departure of Sperchias and Bulis from Sparta seems to have been celebrated in song; cf. Theocr. xv. a)ri/steuse. For Hydarnes cf. vi. 133. 1 n., and for his office v. 25. 1 n. e(/kastos u(me/wn: not e(ka/teros, because u(me/wn, like u(mei=s above, refers not only to the envoys but to all Spartiates present. w)qeo/menoi 35. 5, 3. megalofrosu/nhs. For other instances of magnanimity cf. ch. 27 f., 146 f. That the vengeance should fall on ambassadors was natural enough since the offence had been committed against ambassadors, but that it should fall on the sons of the very men who had taken the guilt of the community on themselves, but had not been allowed to expiate it, was a striking fulfilment of the law that the children must suffer for the sins of the fathers (Ezekiel, ch. xviii; St. John ix. 2, 3), and that the divine Nemesis, which had apparently slept, must in the end manifest itself against the guilty race; cf. vi. 86 and Introduction, \u00a7 36. o(\\s ei)=le. The feat was the more remarkable as Aneristus had only a merchantman. Halieis was a small port on the southern point of the Argolic Acte, in the territory of Hermione, opposite the island now called Spetzia. Its capture must have occurred after the destruction of Tiryns by Argos (after 468 B.C., cf. vi. 83. 2), as tou\\s e)k *ti/runqos would naturally refer to refugees from the fallen city, and in 468 an Olympic victor is still styled *tiru/nqios (Ox. Pap. ii, pp. 89 and 93 n.), and before the second year of the Peloponnesian war, when Halieis was allied with Sparta (Thuc. ii. 56) and Aneristus was seized and put to death (inf.). Presumably it would fall in the years when Athens and Argos were allied against Sparta, 461-50 B.C. For the facts cf. Thuc. ii. 67. He adds three other victims\u2014a Spartan Stratodemus, a Tegean Timagoras, and an Argive Pollis\u2014 whom H. omits, lest they should spoil the moral of the story of retribution, already weakened by the inclusion of Aristeus the Corinthian (for whom cf. Thuc. i. 60 f. and Introd. \u00a7 30 (c). Thucydides further ascribes the treacherous arrest of the envoys, not to Nymphodorus and Sitalces (for whom cf. iv. 80 n.), but to his son Sadocus. Nevertheless the intervention of Nymphodorus is quite probable, since he as Athenian Proxenus induced his brother-in-law Sitalces to make alliance with Athens, and obtained Athenian citizenship for Sadocus (Thuc. ii. 29), and in any case Sadocus must have gained his father's consent. It would seem probable that this striking example of the doctrine of Nemesis drew H.'s attention in 430 B.C. to the fate of the Persian heralds, and led him to insert the story in the part of his history which he was then revising, and not in its proper place (vi 49). Though there are suspicious points in it (e.g. that the barathron and the well would supply earth and water, Wecklein, Sitz. der Bayer. Akad. 1876, p. 230) there seems no sufficient reason for rejecting the whole story (as Macan, Herod. iv-vi, vol. ii, pp. 98-100), or even for denying that Athens emulated Sparta's violation of the sanctity of heralds (Wecklein, loc. cit.; Duncker, vii. 108; Busolt, ii. 571). It does not seem incredible (pace Macan) that even after the rejection by Athens of Persian demands for earth and water (v. 73) and for the restoration of Hippias (v. 96), and even after the burning of Sardis (498 B.C.) and the anger caused by it (v. 102, 105), Darius should have in 492 B.C. given Athens a last chance of repentance, when he was sending heralds round Greece (vi. 48), even though the mission of Mardonius (vi. 44 f.) and the levying of a fleet (vi. 48) show that he expected war. It is difficult to see when or why this story of the maltreatment of heralds should have been invented, and there is nothing incredible in it, especially if (Hauvette, p. 231) they were Greek interpreters, who might be regarded by an angry people as traitors. The Spartans at least, as Macan admits, had something on their conscience, or we should hardly have had this story of the wrath of Talthybius. *bisa/nqh: a Samian colony (later *(raidesto/n, now Rodosto) on the Propontis, here included in the Hellespont (cf. iv. 38 n.).

This apologia was probably written soon after the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war. The charges prompted by fear and envy of Athens, and the pleas she urged in her own defence, are admirably summarized in the speeches of the Corinthian and the Athenian before the Spartan assembly in 432 B.C. (Thuc. i. 68-78). H. is conscious that his opinion will be unpopular in Hellas; cf. viii. 144. teixe/wn kiqw=nes: poetical, perhaps taken from a verse of an oracle, but cf. i. 181. 1, vii. 223. 1, and Demades, ap.

Sparta is throughout the leader (Macan, ii. 219). meta/ ge qeou/s. The salvation of Greece is to the pious historian primarily the work of Heaven (cf. viii. 109). H., though in this part of his work rather regardless of chronological order (Hauvette, p. 323), clearly places these gloomy oracles before the expedition to Tempe (ch. 172-4), in the spring of 480 B.C., and apparently even before the first meeting of envoys from the patriotic Greek states at the Isthmus (ch. 145. 1) in the autumn of 481. But both the tone and the substance of the oracles point to a date when the hope of holding Thessaly has been abandoned, when Delphi has despaired of the Greek cause, and when Attica is menaced by immediate invasion, i.e. between the abandonment of Tempe and the resolution to hold Thermopylae (Hauvette, p. 327; Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 306). After the loss of Thermopylae (pace Macan, ii. 232) Athens would have no time for a double consultation of the oracle. The authenticity of the first oracle is proved by the fact that no one would later have invented gloomy predictions and advice falsified by the event, as well as by the adaptation in Aesch. Pers. 83 f. to\\ i(ro/n: not the temple itself, but the whole precinct (vi. 19. 3) with its varied contents. Here the inquirers, after lustration with water from the Castalian spring and coronation with laurel, prayed and sacrificed, and unless they possessed the right of promanthi/h (i. 54. 2 n.) waited for the turn assigned them by lot. They then were taken into the sanctuary (a)/duton, me/garon), in which was a golden statue of the god, and in the dark background the tripod on which the Pythia sat (cf. i. 47. 2 n.). The plural ka/qhsqe as well as the dual i)/ton (\u00a7 3) refers to the twoqeopro/poi, whereas the singular feu=ge applies to the people they represent. The style and words as in other oracles are derived from the old Epic, gai/hs cf. Hesiod, Theog. 732. The god counsels a general migration, perhaps to South Italy (cf. viii. 62. 2), such as Bias had recommended to the Ionians (i. 170 n.; cf. i. 164-8). troxoeide/os.

Very probably the Persian chariot (ch. 40, 41) was modelled on the Assyrian. oi(: perhaps the temples (cf. l. 15); in Delphi the roof of a temple, in Sybaris the pavement ran with blood (Heraclides, F. H. G. ii. 199), so too an altar of Neptune sweated (Liv. xxviii. 11). Or it may be the gods themselves, i.e. their statues, which often ran with sweat or blood. Cf. sweat.' e)piki/dnate = 'spread your mind on evils', i.e. steep your souls in woes (Stein, Abicht, Macan), seems the meaning rather than 'bear a brave heart amidst your evils' (L. & S., B\u00e4hr, &c.). The tone of the oracle is throughout despairing. proba/llousi, 'in utter despair.' The idea comes from the action of throwing themselves on the ground in despair; cf. Cic. Tusc. ii. For the threat of self-starvation cf. Eur. Iph. Taur. 972, and sitting dharna (Maine, Early Institutions, p. 40), Macan. For the intercession of Pallas cf. Hom.

The Pythia quite naturally names the boundary towards Delphi. *tritogenei=: cf. iv. 180. 5 n. *dhmh/thr: like Ceres = corn. 'When the corn is scattered or gathered,' i.e. in seed-time or harvest; but there may be also an allusion to Eleusinian ritual; cf. viii. 65 Macan. The last two lines have been generally regarded (e.g. by Busolt, Meyer, and even by Hauvette) as an ex post facto addition to the oracle, but in their favour it may be urged (1) they follow naturally the promise e)/ti toi/ pote ka)nti/os e)/ssh|, (2) they admit of a double interpretation (cf. i. 53. 3), (3) the time is vague; only the place is definite. Delphi must have known that the Peloponnesians wished to defend the Isthmus, and that Salamis would be a natural port for the fleet (cf. Munro, J.H.S. xxii. 306). cf. i. 71. 1 a(martw\\n tou= xrhsmou=, and 2. sunesthkui=ai, 'opposed' as combatants; cf. i. 208. 1; iv. 132. 2. r(hxw=|: probably 'palisade'; cf. the gloss fragmo/s.

Others (L. & S.) take it as 'thorn-hedge', the ancient equivalent of modern wire-entanglements. e)/sfalle, 'perplexed'; the same idea reappears with a different metaphor in sunexe/onto, confundebantur. The soothsayers interpreted the last two verses of a naval defeat at Salamis; how then could salvation be found in the fleet, how could that be the wooden wall which was to escape destruction? xrhsmolo/goi: cf. ch. 6. 3 n. It was the official interpreters who clung to the letter of the oracle; cf. ch. 143. 3. As Munro (Cl. Rev. vi. 333) has pointed out, there seem to have been two distinct systems of chronology for the life of Themistocles, differing by ten years. The confusion may have been caused by the fact that the two Persian invasions were just ten years apart, and the two Athenian expeditions to Cyprus and Egypt were also ten years apart. The fixed points in both are that Themistocles died at the age of sixty-five, and that he was archon suo anno, i.e. at the age of thirty. The better chronology runs as follows: 523 B.C. Themistocles born. He belonged to the old Attic family of the Lycomidae, but his mother was a Thracian or Carian (Plut. Them. 1). 493 B.C. Themistocles archon eponymus (Dion. Hal. vi. 34) begins the building of Piraeus (Thuc. i. 93; Paus. i. 1. 2). 490 B.C. Fought in command of his tribe at Marathon (Plut. Arist. 5). 483 B.C. Carried through the decree for the building of a great navy (ch. 144; Ath. Pol. 22); his chief rival Aristides (cf. viii. 79; Ath. Meyer, iii. \u00a7 286 n.). 467 B.C. Flight from argos, since he goes up to Susa when Artaxerxes has just become king (newsti\\ basileu/onta, Thuc. i. 137), i.e. in 465 B.C. Later writers say Themistocles was introduced to Xerxes by Artabanus (Plut. Them. 27; Diod. xi. 56, following Ephorus). This mistake is best explained if Themistocles reached Asia while Xerxes was still alive, and Susa after his death, while Artabanus was still in power. 459-458 B.C. Death of Themistocles (Thuc. i. 138). The early tradition that he poisoned himself (Ar. Eq. 83. 4; Thuc. 1. 138), because he could not fulfil his promise of subduing Hellas, points to some such crisis as the Athenian expedition to Cyprus and Egypt. On the other hand, Plutarch (Them. 31; Cim. 18) connects the death of Themistocles with Cimon's expedition in 449, and since he gives his age at sixty-five, presumably placed his archonship in 483-482, a date modified by Busolt (ii. 642 n.) to 482-481, and the Ath. Pol. (ch. 25) represents him as still at Athens in 462 B.C., and presumably placed his ostracism in 462-461. But this date for Themistocles' ostracism has been proved impossible (Walker, Cl. Rev. vi. 95 f.), and that for his death is most unlikely. The only difficulty in the chronology preferred, apart from newsti\\ pariw/n (inf.), is the long separation between the fortification of Piraeus (493) and the building of the fleet (483). But we must remember that little may have been done at Piraeus for a time, since between 493-483 Athens had much to engage her energy and resources. Indeed, though Hippias had made a beginning at Munychia (Ath. Pol. 19), Phalerum was still the port of Athens in 490 B.C.; cf. vi. 116. In any case it is clear that a better port and dock than that open roadstead was a necessary preliminary to the creation of a great navy. newsti\\ pariw/n: the participle is an imperfect, 'who had but lately come to the front'; cf. Dem. Phil. iii. 24 parelqou=sin ei)s th\\n au)th\\n dunastei/an. The word newsti/ has been used as an argument for bringing down the archonship of Themistocles to 482 B.C, but the expression cannot be pressed in H. (cf. vii. 148. 2), or, if it were it might refer to the recent triumph of his naval policy and the ostracism of Aristides. ei)=xe ei)rhme/non: according to mean 'that if the verse had been spoken of and really applied to', unless with Kr\u00fcger we bracket ei)rhme/non. min: neuter, 1. a)lla/ (sc.e)ke/leuon, ch. 104. 5). The official interpreters tried to harmonize the two oracles by supposing that the second also recommended flight (e.g. to Siris, cf. viii. 62), only particularizing the ships as the means of flight and promising eventual safety. Very possibly this was the meaning primarily intended by the Delphic priesthood (Hauvette, p. 326), but the oracle could also be interpreted in Themistocles' sense, and was thus safe in either case. e(te/rh gnw/mh e)/mprosqe tau/ths. Dated in Ath. Pol. ch. 22 to 483-482 B.C. Though this date may be connected with the later chronology for Themistocles' life (cf. sup.), it is confirmed by other notices in H. The creation of the navy is clearly later than the expedition to Paros (490-489 B.C.), for which Miltiades has but seventy ships (vi. 132), even if that number be accepted; it is also later than and due to the war with Aegina (probably 488-486 B.C.), in which the Athenians had but fifty ships of their own (cf. vi. 89 n.). e)n tw=| koinw=|, 'in the treasury'; cf. ix. 87. 2. Laurium (on which see Ardaillon, Les Mines du Laurion) is the name given by the ancients to the whole hilly and metalliferous region ending in Cape Sunium, and bounded on the north by a line from Thoricus to Anaphlystus (cf. iv. 99 n.). The mines produced silver and lead in abundance. They had been worked from time immemorial (Xen. de Vect. iv, \u00a7 2), and from them Pisistratus (i. 64 n.) drew great wealth, as did Nicias and Hipponicus later (Xen. de Vect. iv, \u00a7 14). They were still important in the Peloponnesian war (Thuc. vi. 91ad fin.), but were less productive, though by no means exhausted, in the time of Xenophon (Vect. iv. 35. 25 f.; Mem. iii. 6. 12). They had been long abandoned in the days of Pausanias (i. 1. 1). Since 1860 much ore has been extracted from the stones and slag formerly thrown aside, an operation already attempted in the days of Strabo (399). The workings, in which only slaves were employed, consisted of shafts and galleries, whose roof was supported by columns (Ardaillon, op. cit. 25 f.). The mines were the property of the State, but were leased to individuals (usually for three years, Ath. Pol. 47), a net sum being paid down (often a talent), and also one twenty-fourth of the produce annually. o)rxhdo/n: in a row, viritim; cf. ei)lado/n, i. 172. 1; h(bhdo/n, i. 172. 2; vi. 21. 1. de/ka = denas. If the citizens be reckoned at 30,000 (v. 97. 2 n.) this would amount to fifty talents, but that sum would only suffice to build a fleet of fifty ships (cf. inf.). th=s diaire/sios pausame/nous. H. leaves it uncertain whether this distribution was exceptional or regular. Plutarch (Them. 4) speaks of a regular, and Cornelius Nepos (Them. 2) of an annual, distribution; this was the custom at Siphnos (iii. 57. 2), and perhaps at Thasos (vi. 46. 3). The Atthis, which is followed by Ath. Pol. 22 and Polyaenus, i. 30, spoke, probably rightly, of an exceptional surplus amounting to one hundred talents, due to the discovery of a fresh mine at Maroneia, a village in the district of Laurium. This sum was handed over to one hundred rich citizens, that each of them might build a trireme. dihkosi/as. This is H.'s figure for the full strength of the Athenian navy (viii. 1 and 14, 44 and 46, 61; cf. Justin, ii. 12), and should not therefore be struck out. He apparently forgot that the navy already amounted to at least fifty ships (vi. 89 n., 132). The later writers, quoted above, while increasing the sum spent to one hundred talents (Ath. Pol. 22; Polyaen. i. 30), all reduce the number of new ships to one hundred. Macan (ii. 214), combining the different versions, suggests an annual increase of fifty ships for two or three years. to\\n pro\\s *ai)ginh/tas le/gwn. Thucydides (i. 14) also gives this war as one of the motives for the creation of the navy, though he evidently thinks the expected Persian invasion more important. Probably Themistocles really looked forward to naval supremacy and empire in the Aegean (th\\n a)rxh\\n eu)qu\\s sugkateskeu/ase, Thuc. i. 93), but wisely preferred in his speeches to the Athenians (Plut. Them. 4) to insist on the need of the moment, rather than on less pressing dangers or more distant hopes. H.'s next words probably mean that it was the Aeginetan war which induced the Athenians to listen to Themistocles, while Thucydides (i. 14) insists more directly on Themistocles' foresight. e)/dee (cf. viii. 6. 2). These ships were intended to form a reserve to take the place of those lost or damaged. Thus, in spite of losses at Artemisium (viii. 16, 18), the Athenian fleet is still reckoned as two hundred strong at Salamis. But was there time to build more ships? The figures can be explained otherwise (cf. App. XIX, \u00a7 1). Congress of patriotic states. Dispatch of spies to Sardis. e)s tw)uto/. Though Pausanias speaks of a meeting at the Hellenium in Sparta (iii. 12. 6), this meeting of delegates in the autumn of 481 B. C. was probably held at the Isthmus, where in the spring of 480, both the council and the forces were gathered together (cf. ch. 172. 1, 173. 4, 175. 1). Plutarch (Them. 6) makes Themistocles the author of this wise resolution, supported by Chileus (cf. ix. 9). The statement is not improbable, but may well be a mere guess. e)gkekrhme/noi: cf. v. 124. 1 e)gkerasa/menos prh/gmata mega/la, vii. 151 fili/hn sunekera/santo, and iv. 152. 5. meta\\ de/: probably in the autumn of 481 B. C., since Xerxes is in Sardis still when the spies reach him (ch. 146). Macan (ii. 219) points out that the congress was summoned (as H. realizes) for the purpose of creating a new Pan-Hellenic Unity, and complete cooperation among the loyal members of the race. ou)damw=n tw=n ou) = pu/ntwn, on the analogy of ou)dei\\s o(/stis ou) (iii. 72. 3; v. 97. 2), ou)damw=n *(ellhnikw=n being assimilated to the case of the relative.

Cf. the similar story of Scipio and the spies of Hannibal before Zama (Polyb, xv. 5; Liv. xxx. 29). i)di/hn implies that freedom is peculiar to the Greeks, other nations being already subject, or prepared to be so (ch. 8 g). e)k tou= *po/ntou. From the Tauric Chersonese and the south coast of Scythia the Greeks (and especially Athens) imported corn largely (cf. iv. 17, and for later times Dem. Lept. ch. 31 f.; Xen. Mem. iii. 6. 13). This made the Hellespont and its trade so important (cf. Grundy, Thucydides, pp. 71-9, 159-61). Aegina, a small and populous island with a barren soil, must always have imported corn, but even as early as 480 B. C. Attica would have been a more natural destination for Pontic corn ships, though complete control of the route was only won by Athens after the formation of the Delian league (Grundy, op. cit., pp. 76, sunwmo/tai e)pi\\ tw=| *p<*>/rsh|, 'the confederates bound together by oath against the Persian'; for the phrase cf. ch. 235. 4, and for the facts ch. 132. 2, 145. 1. newsti/: probably about the year 494 B. C.; cf. vi. 76. 1 n., and App. XVII, \u00a7 3. tw=n dh\\ ei(/neka. The Argives were evidently anxious to absolve themselves of the charge of Medism. Hence they allege that they were only led to consult the oracle at all by the deplorable straits to which they had been reduced through their defeat by Cleomenes. They then were expressly warned to remain neutral, but nevertheless were willing to join the alliance, if Sparta would grant a peace for thirty years, and recognize their claim to an equal share in the leadership. There is no sufficient reason for doubting the genuineness of the oracle, which was in H.'s opinion given about 482 B. C. (au)ti/ka kat' a)rxa/s, cf. ch. 220. 3), but may really date back to the earlier Persian invasion, and sending of heralds in 491-490 B. C. (vi. 49), for had it been an Argive fiction it would have been disowned at Delphi after the defeat of Xerxes. The attitude of the Delphic priesthood, whether from fear or treachery, was before the war one of hostility to the league of patriots. Again, the negotiations with Sparta are a very pretty piece of diplomacy. Argos knew that Sparta would not concede equality, and could therefore safely use the demand to cover her Medism and justify her neutrality. H. does not explicitly reject the special pleading of Argos because he is influenced by Athenian tenderness for a city which later became a useful ally (cf. Introd., \u00a7 30 e). ei)/sw e)/xwn, 'with spear drawn in,' i. e. remain at home on the defensive. probo/laion: rare form = probolh/, pro/bolos (ch. the remnant of the ruling class, the sw=ma being the mass of the population of semiservile origin; cf. vi. 83. 1. kata\\ to\\ di/kaion. In the days of the Trojan war Agamemnon had a widely extended suzerainty, and Argos claimed to succeed to the hegemony held by the Mycenaean king. Further, when the three sons of the Heraclid Aristomachus cast lots for the lands of the Peloponnese, Argos fell to the eldest son Temenus. For similar claims founded on legendary history cf. v. 43, 94, and above all the dispute between Athens and Tegea, ix. 26f. Pheidon (cf. vi. 127. 3n.) had revived the ancient claim of Argos to hegemony. The hope of reasserting it still lived at Argos in the Peloponnesian war (Thuc. v. 27, 28), and made the Argives constantly ready to ally themselves with the enemies of Sparta, e. g. Athens in 461 and 420 B. C. (Thuc. i. 102, v. 44-7). th\\n boulh/n. This council which decides the foreign policy of Argos cannot well be the later democratic boulh/ (cf.

The ultimate decision lay with the Apella (called a(li/h, ch. 134. 2). Cf. App. XVII, \u00a7 2. According to Pausanias (ii. 19. 2) the Argive kings in the second generation from Temenus lost all real power [Pheidon's reassertion of royal power later being regarded as a Tyranny], and ten generations later, Meltas, the last Heraclid, was deposed. Plutarch (Mor. 340 C) says that Aegon was made king after the fall of the Heracleids. Presumably the monarch only retained the old royal right to priesthood and other formal honours, perhaps presidency of the Boule. Since the law said to have been passed in the days of Cleomenes I (cf. v. 75), that only one king should go with the army, was observed in practice, the Spartan reply is a mere evasion. H. would seem to have forgotten his earlier statement. e)/sti lego/menos, 'is current'; cf. ii. 48. 3; iv. 179. 1; vii. 167. 1; viii. 118. 1. That there was some truth in this story is proved not only by the reception of the Argive embassy at Susa (ch. 151), but also by the message to Mardonius (ix. 12), which distinctly implies that Argive co-operation had been promised. Indeed, the vain excuses put forward by the Argives cannot cloak their Medism; connexion between the Argive Perseus and the Persians is no doubt a Greek fiction. It has appeared already in various forms; cf. vi. 54 n.; vii. 11. 4 n., 61. 3 n. prh=gma poih/sasqai, 'to make much of, value highly'; cf. vi. 63. 2, and for prh=gma i. 79. 1. ou)de/n goes both with e)paggellome/nous and metaite/ein; cf. v. 39. 1.

There is no reason to doubt that Callias went to Susa to negotiate for a peace about 448 B. C. (Aristodemus, xiii. 2; 2; Plut. Cim. 13). Nor is there any question that after the death of Cimon peace in fact existed between Athens and Persia, as is shown by the regular trade with Phoenicia (Thuc. ii. 69; viii. 35) and with other parts of the Persian Empire (Ps. Xen. Pol. Ath. ii. the fact that H., a subject of the Athenian empire, travelled freely in the East. Indeed, the Athenians at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war have hopes of help from the Persian king (Thuc. ii. 7), and repeatedly send envoys to him (Arist. Ach. 61 f.; Thuc. iv. 50). The question whether a formal peace was concluded is more doubtful. The earliest distinct mention of it is by Isocrates, Panegyricus, \u00a7\u00a7 117-20, circ. 380 B. C., who repeats the terms in the Areopagiticus, \u00a7 80 (355 B. C.) and the Panathenaicus, \u00a7 59 (340 B. C.). It is mentioned also in the Menexenus (242 A) and twice by Demosthenes (pro Rhod. 29 and de Fals. Leg. 273), as well as by Lycurgus (in Leoc. 73). Its omission by Thucydides in his brief account of the period has been deemed by many fatal to its reality. But it should be noticed that the indignant rejection in 411 B. C. by the Athenians (who were prepared to give up Ionia) of the demand that the Persian should be allowed to sail where he would along his own coasts (Thuc. viii. 56), proves the existence of some convention excluding the Persian fleet from the Aegean. Further, it appears almost certain that a treaty was made with Darius II soon after his accession (circ. 423 B. C.), since not only does Andocides state that Epilycus, his own first cousin, made peace and eternal alliance with the king (Andoc. de Pace 29), but on a contemporary inscription, Heraclides of Clazomenae is thanked for his help in securing the success of the embassy to the king (C. I. A. (vol. iv.) ii. 5 c). It would be extraordinary that Thucydides should omit all mention of this, unless it was a mere renewal on the accession of another king of an older convention. It may therefore be argued that Thucydides indirectly confirms the fact of an understanding with Persia about 448 B. C. The fact which led Theopompus (fr. 168, F. H. G. i, p. 306) to question the existence of a peace, viz. that the inscription recording it was in Ionic letters, indicates at most that the record was not contemporary (though some Attic inscriptions even before 403 B. C. were written in Ionic letters (Hicks 36, 50, 73)); in any case it was accepted as genuine by Craterus, who gave a copy in his collection of Inscriptions. For the terms we are unfortunately dependent on the fourthcentury orators and late historians who are undoubtedly guilty of gross exaggerations. The limits fixed for ships of war, the Cyanean rocks (Dem. de supported by the fact that Phaselis was a member of the Delian league), are probably correct, though Demosthenes (l. c.) and Plutarch (Cim. 13) substitute for Phaselis the more conspicuous landmark of the Chelidonian isles. On the other hand, the stipulation that the king's armies should not come nearer the coast than one day's march for cavalry (Dem. Plut. l. c.) or three days for infantry (Diod. l. c.) 'if ever made' must often have been broken, and Isocrates' limit, the Halys, is a gross and foolish exaggeration. Finally, the notion that the peace secured autonomy for all Greek cities (Lycurg. l. c.; Diod. xii. 4, 5. 26. 2) is clearly a later invention designed to heighten the contrast with the peace of Antalcidas. It is contradicted by the abandonment of Cyprus to the Persian, and by contemporary evidence that the great king never formally relinquished his claims even to Ionia (Hdt. vi. 42 n.; Thuc. viii. 5). This is the reason why H. makes no mention of the peace here, covering it over with the vague phrase e(te/rou prh/gmatos ei(/neka. In the fifth century it was discreditable to Athens to relinquish Cyprus and Egypt, to give up the crusade against Persia and turn her arms against other Hellenes (Thuc. iii. 9. 4), and to obtain from the great king only a grudging recognition of undeniable facts, but in the fourth century this same convention could be elevated by contrast with the base betrayal of Greece by Sparta at the peace of Antalcidas (387 B. C.) into a triumphant assertion of Greek liberties and Greek empire. On the peace of Callias cf. further E. Meyer, F. ii. 71-82; Busolt, e)mme/nei (sc.h( fili/a): cf. i. 74. 4; Thuc. ii. 2. The question gains point if it be remembered that Argos had been since 462 B. C. in alliance with Athens, the enemy of Persia (Thuc. i. 102). About 450, however (Thuc. v. 14, 28, 40), Argos made a thirty years' peace with Sparta, and apparently aimed at returning to her old position of neutrality. For the form of this gnw/mh cf. iii. 38. 1. The attempt to excuse the Argives by the suggestion that others, perhaps the Thebans, were yet more guilty is not convincing. While H. anxiously disclaims all responsibility for the stories which implied most clearly the guilt of the Argives, he seems to condemn them in his heart; cf. viii. 73. 3; Introd. \u00a7 30 c. Since oi)kh/ia kaka/ should mean misfortunes (i. 153. 1; iii. 14. 10; vi. 21. 2), whereas ai)sxra/ implies misdeeds, Macan suggests that H. has confused two ideas. Peoples constantly believe that their own troubles are worse than their neighbours' and as often that their neighbours' vices are worse than their own; more careful study might in each case convince them of error; but the two cases are distinct, though H.'s doctrine that wretchedness is the natural result of sin may account for his confusion between them. Stein would identify kaka/ with ai)sxra/. For this principle of Herodotean criticism cf. ii. 123. 1; iv. 195. 2; Introd. \u00a7 28 (4). Disbelief is implied of the story that the Argives originally invited Persian intervention. Negotiations with Gelo of Syracuse. His origin and rise to power (153-6); his interview with the Greek envoys (157-62); the mission of Cadmus (163-4); and the defeat of Carthaginians in Sicily (165-7). oi)kh/twr o( e)n *ge/lh|, 'he a settler Gela,' in apposition to pro/gonos. This ancestor of Gelo was probably named Deinomenes, who is said to have joined Antiphemus in founding the colony (Etym. M. *ge/la, Schol. ap. Pind. Pyth. ii. 27), since the name is borne by Gelo's father (ch. 145. 2) and by his nephew, the son of Hiero (Pind. Pyth. i. 58, 79). *th=los: half-way between Cnidus and Rhodes, now Dilos or Episkopi. *triopi/w|: cf. i. 144. for Freeman, Sicily, i. 400 f. tw=n xqoni/wn qew=n: Demeter and Persephone (cf. vi. 134. 1). In their worship at Eleusis the Hierophant conducted the ceremonies and showed the sacred objects to the initiated (cf. ii. 171 n.). h)\\ au)to\\s e)kth/sato: or possessed himself of the sacred symbols without help from others, i. e. by direct inspiration or by his own inventive powers, cf. ii. 49. 2. According to the scholiast on Pindar, Pyth. ii. 27, Deinomenes (cf. sup.) brought the rites from the Carian Triopium. It would seem that the position of Hierophant must of necessity belong to the holder of the i(ra/ and his descendants; probably what had been a mere family worship was raised to the rank of a mystery recognized by the state, the priesthood remaining hereditary in the family of Telines (cf. iii. 142. 4; iv. 161. 3), as at Eleusis it was confined to the Eumolpidae. The priestly office was held by Gelo and Hiero (Pind. Ol. vi. 95 with schol.), the former building from the spoils of his victory over Carthage two temples in one precinct to the goddesses in Syracuse (Diod. xi. 26; xiv. 63). There was a great oath by the goddess described by Plutarch, Dion. c. 56; cf. Diod. xix. 5. kai\\ tou=to. The second cause for wonder is that a man of so weak a character should have accomplished so great a deed (cf. viii. 37. 2); the first, apparently that any one should have produced a great political result by the mere display of sacred emblems; cf. H.'s remarks on the restoration of Pisistratus by sacred means (i. 60). pro/s goes with tw=n oi)khto/rwn. The Greek settlers in Sicily are meant. Not only this story of the rise of Gelo (cc. 153-6) but those of Cadmus (c. 163 f.) and of the battle of Himera (165-7) are clearly drawn from local Siceliot sources, probably while H. was at Thurii. The traditions followed are not favourable to the great house of Deinomenes, and need not be Syracusan. They are of the greatest importance, since our only full and connected version of Sicilian history is the late and stupid compilation of Diodorus, who apparently made most use of the fantastic and arbitrary Timaeus. Cleandrus deprived the oligarchs restored by Telines of power and made himself tyrant with the help of the people, circ. 505 B. C. (Ar. Pol. v. 12, 1316 a 35 f.). *panta/rhs. To him would seem to belong a dedicatory inscription found at Olympia, I. G. A. four brothers, Gelo, Hiero, Polyzelus, Thrasybulus (Simon. fr. 142), tyrant of Gela 491, of Syracuse 485-478 B. C., was succeeded by his brother Hiero first at Gela and then at Syracuse. *ai)nhsidh/mou tou= *patai/kou. Clearly he is singled out for mention because he was a prominent man connected with Gelo. He may therefore probably be identified with the father of Thero, afterwards tyrant of Acragas and ally of Gelo (ch. 165). Some words, perhaps *qhrw=nos de\\ patro/s, have fallen out of the text. The genealogy of Thero, however, given by the scholiasts on Pind. Ol. ii. 16 and 82, does not contain the name of Pataecus, calling Aenesidemus son of Emmenides. It would seem from Ar. Rhet. i. 12 that Aenesidemus too dreamed of tyranny at Gela but was forestalled by Gelo; he may well be the tyrant of Leontini (Paus. v. 22. 7), established by Hippocrates. The family of the Emmenidae traced their origin back to Theras (cf. iv. 147 n.). One of Thero's ancestors came from Lindus in Rhodes to Gela, and thence to Acragas, where Telemachus, his grandfather, overthrew the tyrant Phalaris in Ol. 57. Callipolis, a Naxian settlement, not far from its mother-city, perished before Strabo wrote (273). Naxos, said to have been the earliest Greek colony in Sicily, founded 735 B. C. by Thucles from Chalcis in Euboea (Thuc. vi. 3). Possibly Naxians joined in the colony and gave it its name (Hellanicus, fr. 50, F. H. G. i. 51; cf. Freeman, S. i. 570). It lay on a headland a little south of Tauromenium (Taormina), and was razed to the ground by Dionysius. A stream of lava has overspread the site. *zagklai/ous: cf. vi. 23 n. *leonti/nous: founded from Naxos, circ. 729 B. C. (Thuc. vi. 4). Two hills or acropoleis rise from the famous plain; these are still covered with ruins. For a description cf. Polyb. vii. 6. pro/s, 'besides'; adverbial. Cf. v. 20. 4; vii. 166. 1. Corinthians, under Archias, had founded Syracuse, 734 B. C. (?). Corcyra joined Corinth once again to save Syracuse by the dispatch of Timoleon (Plut. Tim. 3). On this occasion Hippocrates had occupied the Olympieium (Diod. x. fr. 28; cf. Freeman, S. ii, pp. 117 f.). *)elw/rw|: also Helorus (now Tellaro), with a town of the same name near its mouth, is a river whose deep valley (Pind. Nem. ix. 40 baqukrh/mnoisi d' a)mf' a)ktai=s *(elw/rou) was spanned by a bridge over which passed the Helorine coast road from Syracuse (Thuc. vi. 70; vii. 80). *kama/rina: near the mouth of the Hipparis on the south coast between Gela and Cape Pachynus. The lake has become a marsh and the city on the hill lies desolate. For its history cf. ch. 156, and fr. 17, F. H. G. i. 186, 187. In the Peloponnesian war it played a hesitating part; cf. Thuc. vi. 75, 88; vii. 33. Its history is a typical example of the jealousy of great cities against their neighbours; cf. Thebes and Plataea, and in mediaeval times Milan and Pavia. i)/sa e)/tea: for seven years, 498-491 B. C. There were in Sicily three towns called Hybla all originally Sicel. The first was superseded by the Greek colony Megara (Strabo 268), on the coast ten miles north of Syracuse; the Sicel town stood on a little height north of the hill of Megara. Thucydides calls the town Megara (vi. 49, 94), and H. its citizens Megarians (ch. 156. 2); both record its destruction by Gelo in 483 B. C. (ch. 156; Th. vi. 4). The second, called by Thucydides (vi. 62) *gelea=tis, was in his time still a Sicel town (vi. 94); it is called by Pausanias (v. 23. 4) *gerea=tis, and by Steph. Byz. s. v. and Cicero (de Div. i. 20, 39) apparently *galew=tis. It lay in the territory of Catana (Paus. l. c.), between Catana and Centuripa (Thuc. vi. 94), and may be placed at Paterno, where an inscription has been found, 'Veneri victrici Hyblensi.' The third, called *(hrai/a, on the road between Gela and Syracuse (Itin. Anton. p. 89), may be placed at or near Ragusa; almost certainly it is the place here meant. Cf. further Holm, G. S. i. 363, 365; Freeman, S. i, pp. 512f. *sikelou/s: cf. ch. 170. 1. gamo/roi. The name, Doric in form, clearly comes from local Sicilian sources. Like the gewmo/roi of Samos (Thuc. viii. 21), they were a land-holding aristocracy. Probably the earliest settlers secured for themselves exclusive possession of the full rights of citizenship, and especially of holding land (e)/gkthsis gh=s). Their holdings were cultivated by serfs (dou=loi), probably the relics of the old native population reduced to a position of villeinage. The *kullu/rioi or *kalliku/rioi, who drove out their masters the *gamo/roi (Timaeus, fr. 56; F. H. G. i. 204), were compared by Aristotle in his Syracusan constitution to the Helots, the Penestae in Thessaly, and the Clarotae in Crete (F. H. G. i. 170). The gamo/roi formed a high court of justice like the comitia at Rome (Diod. viii. 11). The fall of the gamo/roi is connected by Aristotle (Pol. v. 4. 1, 1303 b 20) and Plutarch (Mor. 825 C) with a private feud. It probably took place but a few years before Gelo mastered Syracuse, perhaps only after the defeat of the Syracusans on the Helorus (ch. 154). Clearly the excluded Demos, the town population mainly of Greek origin, joined with native serfs against their masters (cf. Dionys. Hal. vi. 62; Ar. Pol. v. 3, 5, 1302 b 32; and in general Freeman, S. ii. pp. 11-15, 436-9). *kasme/nhs, or Casmenae, founded from Syracuse in 645 B. C. (Thuc. vi. 5); it is to be placed probably at Spaccaforno (Freeman, S. ii. 25, 26). e)/sxe. Gelo reigned seven years (Ar. Pol. v. 12, 1315 b 36); probably 485-478 B. C. He is still called Geloan on his offering for victory at Olympia in 488-487 B. C. (Paus. vi. 9. 4). Hence Pausanias' statement that he became lord of Syracuse in 491 B. C. is a confusion between the beginning of his rule at Syracuse and his first attainment of tyranny at Gela (cf. Busolt, ii. 779 n. 3). h)=sa/n oi( pa/nta, 'was everything to him'; cf. iii. 157. 4 and less exactly i. 122. 3. Syracuse was the centre and capital of his dominion which extended over eastern Sicily, and since to the Greek mind city and state were inseparable, he increased the city at the expense of other communities (\u00a7\u00a7 2, 3). The creation of this greater Syracuse, henceforward the chief city in Sicily, probably saved the island from Punic domination. to\\ a)/stu: the town as opposed to the citadel, v. 64. 2; viii. 51. 2; i. 14. 4. *megare/as: cf. c. 155. 1 n. paxe/as: a popular term for the well-to-do oligarchs; cf. v. 30. 1, 77. 2; vi. 91. 1. The harsh treatment of the Demos is probably to be explained by the fact that it was in part at least of non-Hellenic origin, but the military Sicilian tyrants are throughout less favourable to the people than the tyrants of Greece proper (cf. App. XVI, \u00a7 1). e)p' e)cagwgh=|: sold to slave-traders 'for diakri/nas: distinguishing as at Megara between the nobles and the commons. sunoi/khma: unpleasant to live with; so Aesch.

Hiero's transference of the men of Naxos and Catana to Leontini, his foundation of Aetna, and the later case of Leontini (Thuc. v. 4). That there were negotiations with Gelo is almost certain, but the account here given is clearly unhistorical, whether we trace its origin to some Syracusan satirist (Freeman, S. ii. 515 f.) or to some funeral oration in the Ceramicus with its customary laudations of Athens. Cf. ix. 26 f., and Meyer, F. ii. 219 f. Nor are matters mended by transferring the scene to Corinth and rationalizing H.'s account, as seems to have been done by Timaeus (Polyb. xii. 26 b; fr. 87; F. H. G. i. 213). The essential points, the debate about hegemony and the self-laudations of both sides, remain the same. pa=san th\\n *(ella/da: the whole of Hellas including the colonies. There is some exaggeration here as in pa/nta just above. h(/keis mega/lhs.

Gelo's alliance with Thero (c. 166) served to extend his influence in the west of Sicily. The title is given to Dionysius by the Athenians in official degrees, 393-368 B. C.; cf. Hicks 91, 108, 112. pollo\\s e)ne/keito, 'attacked them vehemently'; so Thuc. de Cor. 199; Theocr. xxii. 90. For pollo/s cf. i. 98. 1. nei=kos. (1) Many writers (e.g. Abbott, ii. 446) follow Holm (G. S. i. 416) in identifying this strife with the great campaign which culminated at the Himera, placing that battle in 481 B. C.; but this is absolutely opposed to the clear meaning of H. (Freeman, ii. 478). Again, the synchronism between the Persian and Carthaginian invasions seems well established (cf. 166 n.); H. makes the Himera coincide with Salamis (ch. 166), and is followed, though more cautiously, by Aristotle (Poet. 23); Diodorus (xi. 24) places it on the last day of the fighting at Thermopylae. Further, there is a high probability that there was some concerted arrangement between the Persian and the Carthaginian (Ephorus fr. ch. 166 n.). (2) Others Meltzer, Karthager, i. 495; cf. Busolt, ii. 790 n.) see in this earlier war a mis-dating of the great invasion by some writer anxious to deprive Gelo of all excuse for refusing his aid to the mother-country, but if so, H. is strangely careless. (3) Freeman (ii. 479), feeling it difficult to find room for the war after Gelo became tyrant (i.e. after 491 B. C.), holds that he refers to some fighting in which he took part as a subordinate of Cleandrus or Hippocrates, but this is surely an impossible interpretation of Gelo's words. Most probably, Gelo and Thero attempted to conquer the Carthaginian strongholds in Western Sicily, Motye, Soloeis, and Panormus, with their Elymian ally Segesta, circ. 483 B. C., and so provoked the great Carthaginian expedition of 480 B. C. (ch. 165 f.). It is true that Diodorus (xi. 1) assigns three years to the Carthaginian preparations, but these are probably only an inference from Xerxes' three years of preparation (vii. 1). *dwrie/os. The story of Dorieus (v. 42-6) contains no reference to this effort of Gelo, and seems to be drawn from an independent source. ta\\ e)mpo/ria: probably the ports of Western Sicily held by the Carthaginians (cf. sup.), but Gelo may well have had wider schemes of opening the trade of the further West, and especially Spain (i. 163; iv. 152), to Hellenic commerce and colonization, breaking the Phoenician and Punic monopoly. He may have thought of a great pan-Hellenic alliance to meet the Semite in the West, and then the Persian in Eastern Greece. dihkosi/asktl. The numbers are suspiciously uniform, though not perhaps incredibly large. Similar numbers appear in Polyb. xii. 26 b, schol. Pind. 111), or v. sup.). At the battle of Himera Diodorus (xi. 21) makes Gelo command 50,000 foot and over 5,000 horse. i(ppodro/mous yilou/s: probably light infantry who fought interspersed among the cavalry like the Boeotian a(/mippoi (Thuc. v. 57; Xen. Hell. vii. 5. 24). Caesar adopted at Pharsalia (B. C. iii. 84) this device, which he found in Gaul (B. G. vii. 18, 36, 80), and which seems to have been a regular practice among the Germans (B. G. i. 48, vii. 65, viii. 13; Tac. Germ. ch. 6). The large proportion of light-armed troops and cavalry shows the higher level of military science in the West. The Sicilian tyrants, making large use of mercenaries, can put in the field a well-equipped force of all arms, not the mere hoplite-phalanx and ill-armed light troops mustered to meet Xerxes. Borrowed Il. vii. 125h)= ke me/g' oi)mw/ceie ge/rwn i(pphla/ta *phleu/s. In Homer Agamemnon of course king of Mycenae, though brother of Menelaus of Sparta. But just as Aeschylus transferred the scene of his play from destroyed Mycenae to Argos (Aesch. Ag. 24, 503, 810), while Euripides wavers between the two, Stesichorus and the Lyric poets, under Dorian influence, made Agamemnon live and die at Amyclae or Agamemnon was shown at Amyclae (Paus. iii. 19. 6) as well as at Mycenae (Paus. ii. 16. 6); there were cults of Agamemnon in Laconia, especially of Zeus Agamemnon at Sparta. For the parallel transference of Orestes cf. i. 67 n. Sparta as head of 'Pelops' isle' naturally claimed the race of Pelops for her own. The comparison is with the Spartans only, and is justified if the numbers in ch. 158 be accepted. *)=w basileu=. To H., speaking in his own person, Gelo is tu/rannos (156. 3, 163. 1), though Scythes is basileu/s (vi. 23. 3 n.), but the Sicilian tyrants like Polycrates (iii. 42. 2) would be flattered by being addressed as 'king' (cf. Pind. Pyth. i. 60, iii. 70; Ol. The 'salutation of Gelo as king' (Diod. xi. 26, 38) was in any case after the battle of Himera, and may well have been, in spite of Diodorus' statement, informal. Probably the official position held by Gelo, as by Dionysius, was that of strathgo\\s au)tokra/twr (Diod. xiii. 94; Polyaen. i. 27. 1). This is confirmed by the fact that Bacchylides (v. 2) addresses Hiero as stratage/; cf. Bury, Cl. xiii. 98; Freeman, S. ii, note 1; Jebb, Bacch. 465. For the alleged claim of Athens to naval hegemony cf. viii. 2 n. pa/ralon, unparalleled in the sense of nautiko/n, is perhaps poetic, as the sentence can be scanned as an iambic. metana/stai, 'land-loupers'; cf. Il. ix. 648; xvi. 59. It was a frequent ground for self-laudation among the Athenians that they, unlike most other Greeks, had always inhabited the same country and could claim to be autochthonous. It forms a regular topic in funeral orations (cf. 157 n.), e. g. that of Pericles (Thuc. ii. 36); in accepted in substance by Thucydides (i. 2) and by H. (i. 56 n.), though the latter considers the Arcadians and Cynurians also autochthonous (viii. 73). saying this.' Gelo had treated the Greek claims as insulting (160. 1). ou)k a)\\n fqa/noite, 'you could not be too soon in,' i. e. the sooner the better, a polite but emphatic exhortation; cf. Arist. Plut. \u00a7 894.) The simile is twice ascribed by Aristotle to Pericles in a funeral oration (cf. Plut. Per. 8, 28), probably that over those who fell in the Samian war 440 B. C. (Meyer, F. ii, pp. 221, 222); cf. Ar. Rhet. iii. 10 and the figure from Pericles is rendered probable by the other resemblances to funeral orations in this passage (cf. 157. 1 n.; 161. 3 n.). Even if the simile be older H. may well have been reminded of it by the striking application of it in Pericles' oration. Here it is far less appropriate, as seems to have been felt by the reader who appended the clumsy explanation which has since been interpolated in the text. Gelo might, however, compare the youthful vigour of the colony, Sicily, to the spring, and the effete mothercountry to the later duller months of the year. *sikeli/hs tu/rannos. Here and elsewhere (ch. 157. 2) Gelo is regarded as suzerain of all (Greek) Sicily. Scythes is probably the lord of Zancle, driven out by Hippocrates, who had found asylum with Darius and died at his court at an advanced age (vi. 24). The friendly relations of Scythes with the Persian court would make his son a most suitable envoy. The special information and favourable verdict of H. on both father and son may be explained by the close connexion between Cos and Halicarnassus. e)s *delfou/s. Delphi was at the time for submission to Persia as seems proved by the oracles (ch. 140, 148, 169). Grundy (pp. 247-56) suggests that Gelo had no sufficient motive for buying off Persia, and sent the treasure to Delphi (if it was sent) for security; the baser motive was subsequently attributed to him by patriotic Greeks who hated tyranny. But is it incredible that Gelo should try to purchase Persian neutrality by a nominal submission? para\\ *sami/wn: the reading of the better MSS. must be adopted, for if meta/ be read Cadmus is made to take a part in the treachery of the Samians through which Scythes (presumably his own father) lost his city and for a time his liberty (cf. vi. 23, 24 n.). But with the reading para/ an intelligible reconstruction is possible. Scythes, leaving the lordship of Cos, bestowed on him by Darius, to his son Cadmus, went to Sicily and made himself ruler of Zancle, becoming apparently (circ. 495 B. C.) a vassal of Hippocrates. In 494 B. C. Samians (and some Milesians) came on his invitation to colonize Kale Acte (vi. 22, 24; Thuc. vi. 4), but on the suggestion of Anaxilas of Rhegium treacherously seized Zancle. Hippocrates, who came as suzerain to aid Zancle, ended by selling it to the Samians. Then Anaxilas, still hoping to make himself supreme in Zancle, stirred up Cadmus to take the city from the Samians (for e)/sxe cf. v. 46. 2; vi. 23. 2, 36. 1, &c.). Cadmus came from Cos with a number of followers (among whom we are told by Suidas (s. v.) was Epicharmus as a baby in arms), and with the aid of Anaxilas recovered Zancle (circ. 490 B. C.). He must, however, have been a mere subordinate of the tyrant of Rhegium, since in all other accounts Anaxilas alone is mentioned (Schol. Pind. Zancle-Messana is fully confirmed by its coinage. Further, it would seem that Cadmus must have been driven from Messene by Anaxilas before 481, otherwise he could hardly have been the trusted envoy of Gelo, the chief foe of the Rhegine tyrant. th\\n metabalou=san. The change of name apparently took place when Anaxilas first put the Samians in possession of Zancle (494-493 B. C.), not as Thucydides implies when he ejected them. This seems proved by the fact that coins on the Euboic-Attic standard, with a lion's head Samian in style on one side, and a calf's head on the other, are inscribed with the word *messhni/wn (Holm, G. S. iii, p. 574; further, Hill, Hist. Greek Coins, 29-35, and C. H. Dodd in J. H. S. xxviii. 56-76). These, which resemble closely the contemporary coins of Rhegium (Head, H. N. 108), must belong to the time when Anaxilas was on friendly terms with the Samians, while those with a running hare and the inscription *messhni/wn on one side and a mule-chariot on the other were introduced by Anaxilas from Rhegium later (Holm, G. S. iii. 576). These types, according to Aristotle (Jul. Pollux, v. 75), commemorated a victory at Olympia, and the introduction of the hare into Sicily (Hill, op. cit. p. 33). Macan prefers the reading meta\\ *sami/wn. He thus makes Cadmus co-operate with the Samians in depriving his own father of the lordship of Zancle. He suggests that there may have been a deep laid plot between the father, the son, and Hippocrates, Scythes being anxious to return to the Persian court and his imprisonment at Inyx (vi. 23) a pretence. Hippocrates certainly behaved strangely in making a bargain with the treacherous Samians at the expense of Zancle (vi. 23), but there is not sufficient evidence of the alleged plot. Subsequently on this supposition Cadmus was driven out along with the Samians by Anaxilas, and then found refuge with Gelo. tw=n e)n *sikeli/h| oi)khme/nwn: i. e. the Greeks; cf. 153. 4.

For descriptions of the site cf. Polyb. ix. 27, and Freeman, S. ii. 224-31, and for the temples id. ii. 79-81 and 402-7. The Carthaginian army here, as elsewhere, is composed mainly of mercenaries (Polyb. i. 67). The Phoenicians are native Carthaginians, the Libyans their African subjects. Spaniards and Ligurians recur frequently in the Punic armies (Diod. Polyb. i. 17, 67, &c.). Diodorus mistakenly adds (xi. 1) Italian mercenaries, troops not employed by Carthage before 409 B.C. (Diod. xiii. 44, &c.), and Celts who are first really used in 343 B. C. (Diod. xvi. 73). *)elisu/kwn: reckoned by Hecataeus (fr. 20; F. G. i. 2; Steph. Byz. s. v.) a Ligurian tribe, a view confirmed by his statement that Massilia was Ligurian, inhabited the coast from the Pyrenees to the mouth of the Rhone, until they were destroyed by the Celtic incursion (third century B. C.). Narbo was their capital (Avienus, Ora Marit. 586). The Ligurians (cf. v. 9. 3) had once also stretched from the mouth of the Rhone to that of Arno (Scyl. 41; Polyb. ii. 16. 2; Nissen, It. i. 470. 1). The number, 300,000, though repeated by Diodorus (xi. 20) following Timaeus (?), may be only an effort of Siceliot patriotic imagination unwilling that Hamilcar should have less troops than Mardonius (H. ix. 32), as the 3,000 transport-ships equal in number those of Xerxes (vii. 97, 104), though 200 triremes are likely enough (cf. Meltzer, Karthager, i. 193). to\\n *)/annwnos. According to Trogus Pompeius 1) the son basile/a: i. e. suffete. Aristotle distinguishes 'the kings' from the generals (Pol. ii. 11), but the offices seem to have been held together in great emergencies (Diod. xiii. 43; xiv. 54). He compares the suffetes to the Spartan kings, save that the office was not hereditary, but elective (cf. kat' a)ndragaqi/hn, ch. 166). Nepos distinctly declares (Hann. 7) there were two suffetes elected annually, and this is confirmed by their comparison with the consuls (Liv. xxx. 7) and the parallel case of Gades (Liv. xxviii. 37). For full details cf. Meltzer, op. cit. ii. 64-72, 482-7. Both H. and Aristotle speak as if the coincidence was accidental; cf. Poet. dates the battle of Himera to the same day as Thermopylae, asserts there was an alliance between Persia and Schol. Pind. Pyth. of these two versions of the alliance can be traced back beyond the fourth century, their divergence in language is rather in their favour as suggesting an independent origin. Nor is the language of Ephorus unsuitable. The great king would very probably treat the colonists of his Phoenician subjects as though he were their sovereign, and the Carthaginians might not care to dispute the form so long as they secured the real advantages of an alliance. We cannot safely argue from the silence of H. and Aristotle that they were ignorant of any co-operation, much less that it did not exist in fact. The enemies of the Greeks would naturally plan a simultaneous attack, and in concerting their plans the Phoenicians would be useful intermediaries. The alliance may then be accepted (with Meltzer, Freeman, Busolt, E. Meyer, and Grundy) as against the Beloch, Hauvette, and Macan. e)n th=| *sikeli/h|. H. is equally vague in 167. 1. The battle was near Himera (Pind. Pyth. i. 79). According to Diodorus (xi. 20 f.), Hamilcar, after losing through a storm his cavalry and chariots on his voyage, landed at Panormus. Thence he marched to Himera and, after a victory, besieged the town, which was defended by Thero. Gelo coming to its aid with 50,000 foot and 5,000 horse, surprised and captured many Carthaginian stragglers. Then hearing that Hamilcar expected a force of cavalry from Selinus, he sent his own horsemen to personate them. These troops slew Hamilcar at the beginning of the action, while he was sacrificing, threw the Carthaginian army in the seacamp into confusion and set fire to the fleet. Meanwhile Gelo fell on the main Punic army near the land-camp, and after a stubborn fight slaughtered the enemy to the number of 150,000. This account (given in detail by Grundy, pp. 422-5) is irreconcilable with H. as to the time and manner of Hamilcar's death (cf. Freeman, ii. 186-99, 518-22), and shows clear signs of rhetorical exaggerations in the number of the slain and in the account of Gelo's stratagem, which is compared with that of Themistocles. On the other hand, the two camps and the burning of the fleet (cf. Polyaen. i. 27) look like genuine local tradition. Probably Timaeus overlaid such a tradition with his own rhetoric. The account is regarded as untrustworthy by Meltzer, E. Meyer, Beloch, and Busolt, though sw/mata o(/la. The practice of burning the whole body of the victim was originally common to the Phoenicians and Jews (Porphyr. de Abst. iv. 15; Lev. vi. 23); later the Carthaginians, like the Greeks, burnt only certain parts (cf. Meltzer, op. cit. ii. 147-9), but the older ritual might naturally be followed on so great an occasion. For the Oriental self-immolation of the Punic version cf. i. 86 n. oi( qu/ousi. Hero-worship seems to have been as unknown to the Phoenicians as it was to the Egyptians (ii. 50. 3); nor even if Hamilcar's self-sacrifice was regarded as heroic could it account for a cult in all colonies. Hence Movers and Meltzer suggest that H. has confused Hamilcar = Abd-Melqart, servant of Melcarth, with the Phoenician god Melcarth, whose worship is closely connected with such passing through the fire. Compare Moloch, and the story of Dido. mnh/mata: probably pillars like that in the temple of Melcarth at Tyre (ii. 44. 2). Fruitless embassies to Corcyra and Crete (with excursus on Minos in Sicily). du/namin ou)k e)laxi/sthn: so in 433 B. C. The Corcyrean cf. i. 14). They had 120 ships in 435 B. C. (Thuc. i. 25). The Etesian winds (cf. ii. 20), which are said to blow very hard off Cape Malea from the north-east (cf. vii. 188; viii. 12), lasted for about forty days in August and September. The battle of Salamis took place about Sept. 25. It is remarkable that the Corcyreans are not taunted by the Corinthians (in Thuc. i. 37-43) with this instance of selfishness and double-dealing. But the dislike and suspicion felt by the rest of Greece for the western island is patent. The Corcyrean envoys themselves admit that their traditional policy of splendid isolation has proved a failure. Thuc. 323) charitably suggests that the Corcyreans may never have promised to do more than protect the southern Peloponnese from attack, if the Persian admirals detached a squadron for the purpose; then their subsequent neutrality caused their absence from the line of battle to be misinterpreted. But it seems more likely that Corcyra did aim at avoiding compromising alliances, and was loth to send her navy to resist the Persian, when she might so soon need it for her own defence against the Carthaginian. koinh=|. The island was divided between a number of city-states. a)/meinon gi/netai: the regular form of inquiry; cf. i. 187. 2, iv. 15. 3, &c.; Thuc. i. 118ad fin. 'Fools, do ye find ought to complain of in the woes brought on you by Minos in his wrath for the help ye gave Menelaus?' The god by an ironical question (for me/mfomai ironically used cf. viii. 106. 3 ad fin.) reminds them how they had suffered in the past for similar conduct. The words timwrhma/twn *mi/nws e)/pemye mhni/wn dakru/mata seem to have been taken as they stand from the oracular response (cf. iv. 163. 3; v. 79. 1 n.; vii. 178. 2). Stein and Busolt (ii. 658 n. 6) suspect it of being a later forgery, like the response to the Cnidians (i. 174. 5), mainly because it is in iambic metre. H. clearly believed it genuine, and probably for that reason does not blame the Cretans for refusing help. Doubtless the lying Cretans would have had no scruple in inventing later an oracle to exculpate their conduct; but that here given is of the same tenor as the better attested response to Argos (ch. 148), and may well be in substance genuine. *sikani/hn. While Beloch (i. 178) and Nissen (i. 548) maintain, after Niebuhr, that Sican and Sicel are mere variants of one name and one race, Freeman (i. 472 f.), who has converted Holm (Cl. R. v. 423), strongly argues that Thucydides (vi. 2) and Philistus (ap. Diodor. v. 6; fr. 3, F. H. G. i. 185) are right in saying that the Sicans are Iberians, though they claimed to be autochthonous (Thuc. l. c.; Timaeus; fr. 2, F. H. G. i. 193). It seems clear that the Sicels were later immigrants from Italy who drove the Sicans to the west of Sicily, and were in turn pressed by the Greeks into the centre and north of the island. Minos found Daedalus in Camicus, the city he had built for Cocalus the Sican king. He was hospitably received by Cocalus, but enticed into a warm bath and there slain by the king or his daughters. Of Sophocles' play the *kami/kioi but two small fragments remain. For later versions cf. Diod. iv. 79; Strabo 279. *poli/xnh: a small place near Cydonia in Western Crete on the north coast; cf. Thuc. ii. 85. *prai=sos: high on the central plateau near the east end of Crete. Two 'Eteocretan' inscriptions have been found there in recent excavations (J. H. S. xxi. 340). That these two cities took no part in the expedition is no historical tradition, though it may have been derived, like the notice of the newer colonists, from Praesus (cf. 171. 1), but merely an inference from the fact that their inhabitants belonged to the pre-Hellenic 'Minoan' race (Hom. Od. xix. 176; Strabo 475, 478), and therefore presumably had not been affected by the migration preceding or following the death of Minos. The words sto/lw| mega/lw| imply a large migration which left Crete empty (cf. 171. 1); this hypothesis explained the disappearance of the 'Minoan' people, and the existence as early as Homer of Achaeans, Pelasgians, and Dorians in Crete. For other Minoan traditions cf. i. 171-3; iii. 122 nn. *kamiko/s (Strabo 273, 279) may perhaps be placed at Caltabelotta (cf. Freeman, i. 503), if that stronghold on the hill be within the territory of Acragas (Diod. iv. 78). Later writers (Paus. vii. 4. 6; Steph. Byz.) inaccurately substitute *)/inuc or *)/inukon (cf. vi. 23. 4 n.). Freeman (i. 113, 502) believes that this whole legend grew up in Acragas, the existence of Minoa (cf. v. 46. 2 n.) suggesting the presence of Minos (but cf. iii. 122. 2 n.). Thero is said to have sent back to Crete the supposed remains of Minos (Diod. iv. 79). *(gri/hn. Probably the Uria of Strabo (282) (modern Oria), on a ridge between Tarentum and Brundisium, still containing in his day the palace of an early king, not Veretum, close to the heel of Italy, cape Leuca; cf. Nissen, Ital. ii. 875, 884. Iapygia (cf. iv. 99) is the promontory south of Tarentum and Brundisium, the Messapii being the tribe nearest Tarentum (Nissen, op. cit. i. 539-40). Other accounts make these Cretans found Brundisium (Strabo 279, 282) and even cross the Adriatic and Illyria, to settle on the Thermaic gulf as Bottiaeans (ch. 123. 3). This disaster is dated by Diodorus (xi. 52) to the year 473 B. C. It was to some extent balanced by a Tarentine victory over Messapians and Peucetians (Paus. x. 13. 10). Probably Micythus made alliance with Tarentum in the hope of opposing a barrier to the growing power of Syracuse. fo/nos *(ellhniko\\s me/gistos.

It is unlikely that a slave (or even a freedman) should add his father's name on his offerings at Olympia (v. inf.) and call Rhegium and Messana his fatherland (Paus. l. c.). Probably he was a low-born dependant of Anaxilas (cf. Maeandrius, iii. 142). For e)pi/tropos cf. the case of Aristagoras at Miletus (v. 30. 2), and again Maeandrius (iii. 1) e)pitropai/hn para\\ was clearly regent of Rhegium and Messana for the young sons of e)kpesw/n. Paus. oi)/xoito. Micythus had been regent nine years (476-467), his wards, instigated by Hiero, demanded an account of his stewardship. Through this, his honesty was so strikingly proved that they begged him to keep on the administration, but Micythus, preferring to retire, lived in honour at Tegea till his death. This is a little inconsistent with H.'s e)kpesw/n. The offerings of Micythus at Olympia seen by Pausanias (v. 26) were in three groups, comprising in all fifteen figures (besides some removed by Nero) by Argive sculptors, Glaucus and Dionysius. Fragments of pedestals have been found bearing inscriptions restored by Roehl, I. G. A. 532, 533, and better by Kaibel (Hermes, xxviii. 60), showing that the offerings were made for the recovery of his son from sickness. tri/th| geneh=|. In Homer (Il. xiii. 451 f.; Od. xix. 178 f.), Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans before Troy, is the son of Deucalion the son of Minos. For his exploits cf.

For these cf. ch. 6, 130, and for H.'s attitude towards the Thessalians Introd., \u00a7 30 e. pro/bouloi (cf. vii. 145 n.). Presumably these Probouloi settled the general plan of campaign, which was determined by political as well as by military considerations. They are distinct from the separate councils of admirals (at Salamis) and of generals (at Plataea), which are merely advisory to the Spartan commandersin-chief (cf. Macan on ch. 145). cf. 132. 1 n. and 196-8. e)strath/gee. The command in war was a royal prerogative (vi. 56 n.; Ar. Pol. vi. 14. 2 f., 1285 a), but on distant or less important expeditions, it was at times given to private Spartans, e. g. Anchimolius (v. 63) and Brasidas in Thrace. Possibly the number of Spartans sent to Tempe was not great, for Sparta was unwilling to send large forces so far from home (ix. 8-10). For *eu)ai/netos Diodorus (xi. 2) reads *su/netos, surely by a clerical error (J. H. S. xxii. 305 n.). The polemarchs were, next to the king, the highest Spartan officers (Thuc. v. 66), commanding the lo/xoi at Mantinea in 418 B. C. (Thuc. v. 71), and later the mo/rai (Xen. Hell. v. 4. 46).

In two places Thermopylae is a(macito\\s mou/nh (176. 2). The average breadth of Tempe between Mount Ossa and the Peneius is about 150 feet, but in many places the river leaves so little room that the modern road has been cut through the rocky slopes of Mount Ossa. The way must have been very rough though not impassable in 480 B. C. Herodotus clearly means to insist on three points of advantage at Thermopylae: (1) there was only one pass (cf. 173. 4), and that was both (2) narrower than Tempe, and (3) nearer home. gh=s th=s *(istiaiw/tidos depends on *)artemi/sion. The north of Euboea is the territory of Histiaea (viii. 23. 2). The name Histiaeotis was also given (cf. i. 56. 3 n.) to the land of the Perrhaebi in N. Thessaly (ch. 128. 1 n.). tau=ta: i. e. Thermopylae and Artemisium. The fleet at Artemisium guarded not only the Euripus (ch. 183. 1; viii. 15. 2), but 'the only landing-places which give practicable access to the interior of the country north of Marathon' (J. H. S. xxii. 304). Munro (J. H. S. xxii. 312) further brings out admirably not only that 'Thermopylae could not have been held without Artemisium, for it would have been at once turned by the enemies' fleet, but also that Artemisium was useless without Thermopylae, for the Persians would never have attacked the Greek fleet but simply sailed past it outside Euboea, if the land road to the Isthmus had been open. All they wanted was to get their army and fleet to the Peloponnese at the same time'. Cf. also App. XX, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, and 5. tou=to me/n, 'firstly,' answered by de\\ au)= (2); cf. 106. 2. to\\ *)artemi/sion. The construction is loose, *)artemi/sion being put forward as the main subject of the following description. It was a beach looking northwards towards Olizon. The name no doubt comes from the temple of Artemis Proseoa (cf. inf., Plut. Them. 8). *trhxi/s is used by H. for the city elsewhere (ch. 199, 201, and probably 203. 2), but here for the country Trachinia (ch. 199, 201; viii. 31), as also in viii. 21. 1, 66. 1; and Thuc. iv. 78, v. 12, 51. th=s a)/llhs. By an idiomatic compression the 'narrowest part' is included in the rest of the country with which it is really contrasted. Cf. Tac. Agr. 34 'ceterorum Britannorum fugacissimi' and Milton's 'fairest of her daughters Eve'. Though there is a verbal contradiction in saying 'the pass through Trachis where narrowest is fifty feet broad, yet this is not the narrowest point but before and behind where it is only some six feet', the meaning is pretty clear. Herodotus is first describing the best known and most defensible part of the pass, 'the Middle Gate,' near the Phocian wall (inf.), and the little hill where the last stand was made (ch. 225), which was about fifty feet wide; and then inconsistently adds further statements as to the western and eastern gates, in front of and behind the pass proper, where there was in his day but just room for the road. [Macan's suggestion that H. meant by h( dia\\ *trhxi=nos e)/sodos the entirely different pass up the gorge of the Asopus into Doris (cf. viii. 31 n.; vii. 199 n.) is impossible.] H. here gives us in broad outline a general description, reserving details for ch. 198-200, chapters which should be studied in connexion with this. But the main points are here. The pass between mountain and sea has at either end an extremely narrow gate; the western gate, however, near Anthela, could be easily turned by crossing a projecting spur of the mountain, the eastern near Alpeni (ch. 216) is clearly behind the Greek position. In the three miles between them lay a double amphitheatre contracting about halfway at the Middle Gate; this is the true Thermopylae where are the hot springs and the Phocian wall (cf. 241 n.). For a full description cf. Grundy, p. 284 f. Clear and good as is this description in general, the direction of the coast is wrongly given. H. evidently thought that the road through the pass ran from north to south, since he here describes various features on either side as lying east or west of it, and later (ch. 199, 200. 1, 201 ad fin.) speaks of points on the road as lying north or south of each other. In reality the coast and road bend to the east near Trachis. But the error is natural if, as appears likely from the route-map given (ch. 198-200), and from the expression 'before' and 'behind' Thermopylae (\u00a7 2), H. visited Thermopylae while on a journey from the north to Greece, since the road from Lamia runs due north and south across the plain, and the bend in the ancient road may have been more gradual than that in the modern. Macan is surely wrong in doubting whether H. had been at Thermopylae (cf. Grundy, Quart. Rev., vol. ccii, p. 136). The head of the Maliac gulf has now receded about four miles, and the pass itself is now separated from the sea by a tract of marshy ground a mile or more in width formed of the alluvial deposits brought down by the rivers and encircled by the precipitous sides of Mount Oeta and Callidromus (cf. ch. 198; Strabo 428). Even now, however, between the Asopus and the Middle Gate of Thermopylae the ground to the left of the road is impassable marsh. For H.'s sea and marsh cf. qerma\\ The hot springs, which are copious and over 120\u00b0 F. in temperature, rise on the side of Callidromus, a great cliff mounting almost sheer to a height of 3,000 ft. and on the edge of a great fan-shaped mass of stream d\u00e9bris. The stream, which is of a bright clear green (cf. Paus. iv. 35. 9), first enters the baths and then turns two mills (cf. Grundy, p. 286). *xu/troi: two 'cauldrons' or baths devoted in ancient times one to male and the other to female bathers; cf. being created by Athene or Hephaestus, according to different myths, to refresh the weary hero. So Peisander, ap. district was the scene of many incidents in the life of Heracles and of his death (cf. ch. 193. 2, 198. 2, 216; and Sophocles, Trachiniae). For the wall cf. ch. 208, 223, 225. The existing remains of wall foundations on the neck by which the first mound is attached to the mountain side are believed by Grundy (pp. 288, 289) to be relics of a wall identical, at least in site, with the one which the Phocians built. It lies a little east of the Middle Gate and of the springs. It seems clear that the Phocians used the springs to channel (\u00a7 4) the road in front, i. e. west of the wall, and so to hinder the Thessalian cavalry. At this period Phocis no longer extended to the pass; the Malians who dwelt west of it were dependents of Thessaly, and east of the pass the Locrians dwelt (cf. 216. 1). But in old days the Phocians may have reached the Spercheius, as the names Anticyra and Trachis occur both in this region and in Phocis proper. Later the Phocians were driven out by Malians and Locrians, losing even their northern coasts except round Daphnus. *)isqmou=.

For similar reminiscences cf. ch. 169. 2 n.; Verrall, Cl. Rev. xvii. 98 f. *qui/h: daughter of (or according to Delphic legend of Castalius; cf. Paus. x. 6. 4) and mother by Apollo of Delphus. She was believed to have been the first to sacrifice to Dionysus, hence the Attic and Delphic women who served that god with orgiastic rites were called *qui=ai or *quia/des (distinguished by Rapp from the purely mythological Maenads); cf. Paus. x. 6. 4. The name means 'stormy' (cf. qu/ella); hence she is naturally connected at Delphi with the winds. First naval operations. Advance of the Persian fleet to Sepias (179-83). Estimate of the Persian forces (184-7). The three days' storm (188-91). The Greek fleet returns from Chalcis (183) to Artemisium, the Persian moves to Aphetae (192-3). The Greeks take a squadron of fifteen (194-5). pare/bale: intransitive, 'crossed over'; cf. Thuc. iii. 32ad fin. H. writes as if the whole fleet had taken the course followed, in fact, by the vanguard (ch. 183) of ten ships. One of these vessels is declared to have been Sidonian (viii. 92), and they were the best sailors (vii. 96. 1). e)/nqa: not close to the island but further north, on the line between Therma and Sciathos, opposite the mouth of the Peneius (ch. 182), unless indeed (Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 308; cf. Blakesley) the Phoenician squadron kept well outside Sciathos at first, and then approaching the channel between it and Magnesia from the south, drove the Greek look-out ships northwards. diade/cion: best taken as decio/n (ai)/sion), laetissimum omen captantes (Blakesley). They may have gone on the maxim 'Who spills the foremost foeman's life, that party triumphs in the strife' (Scott), cf. Tacitus, Germ. 10; but the act is more probably simply a sacrifice of the first-fruits of victory such as Procopius ascribes to the Scandinavian Thulitae (de Phoenicians cf. ch. 167, and among the Persians ch. 114. 2 n. ta/xa d' a)/n, 'perhaps he may have had his name to thank in part for his fate.'

Clearly it was one of the duties of this squadron to make the way safe (cf. kaqaro/n for the main body. Scyros, an island about twenty-three miles off the east coast of Euboea, was then inhabited by the semi-barbarous piratical Dolopes, later driven out by Cimon. Cape Sepias is generally and rightly identified with the modern Cape St. George opposite Sciathos. Mr. Wace prefers Cape Pori, but his reasons are not convincing (J. H. S. xxvi. 143-8). If Cape Sepias be Pori, then Casthanaea, which lay north of it, under Mount Pelion (Strabo 443), must be Keramidhi (Tozer, Highlands of Turkey, ii. 104); but if it be Cape St. George, Casthanaea may more probably be placed at Zagora or Khorefto (Tarn, J. H. S. xxviii. 211). The voyage would seem to be 90-100 miles direct across the sea, or, if we allow for coasting, perhaps 120 miles (Cl. R. xxiii. 186). Such a distance would not be beyond the powers of a single ship on a long summer's day, e. g. 15-16 hours. We are told that a trireme could be rowed from Byzantium to Heraclea (150 miles) in a long day (? 18 or 24 hours; Xen. Anab. vi. 4. 2), and the second Athenian trireme sent to Mitylene must by extraordinary exertions have accomplished the voyage of 210 miles in something like 24 hours (Thuc. iii. 49). Further, a merchant ship (nau=s stroggu/lh) could, with an absolutely favourable wind, do some 150-160 miles in 24 hours, e.g. from Abdera to the mouth of the Ister (nearly 600 miles) in four days and nights, i. e. a little more than 6 miles an hour (iv. 86; Thuc. ii. 97). So, again, the voyage round Sicily (510 miles) takes not much less than 8 days (Thuc. vi. 1), while that from Thasos to Amphipolis, or rather Eion (50 miles), is reckoned at half a day's sail (Thuc. iv. 104). These instances seem to prove that a single merchantman could do 6 miles an hour and a warship something more, say 8 miles an hour. But single-ship voyages are no evidence for fleets, since the pace of a fleet is that of its slowest member. Now (Xen. Hell. i. 1. 13) Alcibiades took a whole autumn night and up to a)/riston next morning (i. e. 16-18 hours) to sail with 86 ships from Parium to Proconnesus (not 35 miles), while Agathocles (Diod. xx. 5) took 6 days and nights from Syracuse to Cape Hermaeum (circ. 300 miles). Similarly, the voyages of Caesar's fleet from Lilybaeum to Ruspina (Bell. Afr. 34) and from Utica to Caralis (ch. 98) work out at 2 miles an hour or less, while those of Scipio (Liv. xxix. 27) and of Caesar (Bell. Afr. 2) from Lilybaeum to Africa, though regarded as quick and good voyages, work out under 3 miles an hour. The Athenian fleet in Sicily sailed 36 miles from Catana to Syracuse during the night (7-8 hours; Thuc. vi. 65), and Philip V's fleet of swift Illyrian lembi when panic-stricken fled (Polyb. v. 110) from the mouth of the Achelous to Cephallenia (circ. 180 miles) in about 36 hours; these fleets in a great hurry do something like 5 miles an hour. It is true that Aemilius Paulus states (Liv. xlv. 41) that he sailed from Brundisium to Corcyra in 9 Roman (i. e. 11 1/2 English) hours, and that if Corcyra be the town this would mean 10 miles an hour, and if the nearest point of the island 8 miles an hour; but this isolated and doubtful record time does not justify us in ascribing so high a rate of speed to the unwieldy Persian armada. Cf. Grundy and Tarn, Cl. Rev. xxiii. 107 f. and 184 f. For a discussion of the numbers of Xerxes' army and fleet cf. App. XIX. 2 f. Here we may remark that the moment chosen by H. for his enumeration is appropriate. The great host had now gathered to itself contingents from Europe, and had not yet suffered loss either in storm or battle. The separation of the description of the forces (ch. 61-99) from the estimate of their number indicates that H. found no numbers in the official Persian lists (cf. ch. 60. 1, 61. 1 n.). For the number of the triremes he relied on tradition (ch. 89), as also for that of the Asiatic land forces (ch. 60), but the enormously exaggerated numbers of the forces from Europe rest on mere conjecture (185. 1 and 2); the over-estimate of the crews of the smaller vessels (184. 3) is a rough guess from the supposed number of such vessels, and the addition to the armed force of an equal number of attendants (ch. 186) is a purely gratuitous assumption. H. is clearly dominated by the popular belief (c. 228. 1) that Xerxes led three million warriors against Greece. He makes no allowance for losses through sickness or desertion on the march. After plh=qos h)=n (sc.tou= stratou=, ix. 96. 2) the numbers would naturally be given in the nominative, but the words to\\n me\\n . . . o(/milon, which repeat the idea, are put in the accusative as though dependent on the verb of the w(s . me/n, answered by tou= de\\ pezou= (\u00a7 4), gives the division into land and sea forces. The latter are then subdivided into native contingents (\u00a7 1) and Persian marines (\u00a7 2). a)rxai=on (cf. iv. 99. 2): the original native crew in contrast to the added Persian Epibatae. dihkosi/ous: 200 was the regular complement of a Greek trireme (viii. 17; Xen.

They are not separately reckoned since they are included in the crew of 200. Since the primitive method of fighting at sea was by boarding (cf. ix. 98. 2; viii. 90. 2; and especially Thuc. i. 49), every trireme carried a large number of marines, each Chian ship at Lade 40 (vi. 15. 1), each trireme here 30 Persians, Medes, or Sacae (the best troops in the army, cf. viii. 113. 2), besides the native levies, though, if we may believe Plutarch (Them. 14), the Athenians at Salamis had only 14 hoplites and 4 archers on each ship. Later sea captains aimed at sinking the enemy by ramming, after disordering them by the die/kplous (vi. 12 n.). Accordingly the Athenians in the Peloponnesian war reduced the number of Epibatae on each ship to 10 (Thuc. ii. 92 compared with ii. 102; iii. 91 with iii. 95; iv. 76 with iv. 101). poih/sas, 'putting them at' (cf. \u00a7 4, and ch. 186. 2). o(/ ti ple/on = plus minus, i. e. on the average. pro/teron: cf. 97 ad fin. The three thousand vessels there mentioned included, besides penteconters, thirty-oared galleys, light boats, and horse transports; now though a crew of eighty may be a reasonable assumption for a penteconter, counting in officers, sailors, and marines, it is far too large a number for the smaller galleys and boats. e)mple/ein and e)nei=nai are used of the crew, especially of the rowers in the hold of the ship; e)piple/ein and e)pei=nai of the marines on 119. e)k tw=n nh/swn: i. e.

The number of men rests (1) on the assumption that all the ships were triremes; (2) on the conjectural and exaggerated number of ships (120). *pai/ones: cf. ch. viii. 115; v. 1.

In a Greek army (cf. ix. 29. 2) each hoplite was accompanied by an attendant (u(phre/ths, ch. 229. 1), who carried his baggage, provisions, and shield (hence u(paspi/sths, Xen. Anab. iv. 2. 20; Hell. iv. 5. 14, 8. 39), and each horseman by a groom to look after his horse. Thus the addition of an equal number of non-effectives was the rule for a Greek force. Nor need we doubt that the Persian king and grandees brought with them large trains of servants. But to suppose that all the barbarous tribesmen enumerated in Xerxes' host brought each an attendant is absurd. The doubling of the sailors is based on the assumption that the crews of the transport ships were as numerous as those of the triremes. *ce/rchs o( *darei/ou. The patronymic is added here not to distinguish this Xerxes from others of the same name, but to emphasize the dignity of the master of the great host just enumerated; cf. iii. 66. 2, 88. 1; vi. 137. 1; vii. 1. 1; ix. 41. 1, 64. 1; and Thuc. ii. 19, 34, 47, 71, &c.

H., who has been wonderfully accurate in his calculations hitherto, here makes a blunder in dividing. A choenix a day given to each of 5,283,220 men amounts (at 48 choenices to the medimnus) not to 110,340 medimni but to 110,067 1/2. He divided the 528 myriads correctly, getting the result 1,100, but in dividing the 3,220 by 48 he put his penultimate remainder 340 in place of the true quotient 67 1/12, as may be seen by doing the sum. For other errors of calculation cf. i. 30 n. Tarn (J. H. S. xxviii. 212-15) regards the whole account of the storm as a blend of two irreconcilable stories. In one, the Persian fleet is rightly regarded as strung out along the little beaches of Magnesia, and the loss fell chiefly on the supply-ships driven ashore at many places from Meliboea to Cape Sepias (188. 3, 191. 1); in the other, a poetical invention, Homer is closely imitated. The whole fleet comes to a harbour too small for it, and is drawn up, more Homericopro/krossai, and defended with a bulwark (e(/rkos of wreckage (188. 1, 191. 1). Further, the losses are greatly exaggerated. Even if we reject this hazardous analysis, we must recognize the patent imitation of Homer, and the evident exaggeration in the account of the storm and of the losses caused by it. pro\\s gh=| and e)p' a)gkure/wn are opposed, the innermost row of ships was moored to the land, the outer rows swung at anchor. pro/krossai: probably 'with beaks turned seawards'. kro/ssh = ko/rsh head (cf. ko/rus, ko/rumbos) is used apparently for battlements (Hom. Il. xii. 258, 444; and cf. H. ii. 125. 1). Thus in iv. 152. 4 the griffin-heads encircling the bronze bowl in the Heraeum stood out in relief. Here the ships are in eight rows, and the high prows turned seawards stand out like battlements; cf. Eustathius observes, is completed and interpreted by this passage. The Achaean ships were drawn up in parallel rows on the beach, row behind row landwards, just as the Persian ships here lay at anchor in eight rows off the shore. Aristarchus takes kro/ssai as 'ladders', and explains that the ships in the Iliad were drawn up on the shelving beach one above the other, like the audience in a theatre, but the explanation is inapplicable here. Schweigh\u00e4user, however, would construe 'in quincuncem dispositae'. a)phliw/ths: east. *kaiki/hs (north-east) would be more 121 'Caecian aliqui vocant Hellespontiam'). The icycold north-easter blowing from the of Russia over the Euxine is meant. The Athenians living further south call it Boreas (north wind); cf. vi. 44. 2; Meliboea, a considerable city (Hom. Il. ii. 717) in a shallow bay (Strabo) at the foot of Ossa (Liv. xliv. 13). It is proved by inscriptions to be Thanatu, where there is a long stretch of beach (J. H. S. xxviii. 210). a)/llou: besides the two already given (ch. 140, 141). gambro/n: here in its original meaning a relation by marriage, khdesth/s, affinis. Erechtheus, father of Oreithyia, was ancestor as well as king of the Athenians. The legend was that Boreas seized her, as Hades did Persephone, while she strayed in the fields picking flowers, and carried her off to his home in wintry Thrace, where she bore him two sons, Zetes and Calais, the Argonauts. For the rationalization of the myth cf. Plato, Phaedrus, and Ruskin, Queen of the Air. Oreithyia evidently became a wind-goddess as Persephone became chthonic. The ordinary derivation from o)/ros and qui/ein (cf. ch. 178. 2 n.) = montivaga is improbable. Miss Harrison (Myth. and Mon. Athens, lxxiv-ix) declares her originally a Nereid (as in Hom. Il. xviii. 48-9), daughter of the old sea-king Poseidon-Erechtheus. Boreas courting the sea-nymph is the wind sporting among the waves. Later both she and her father become Attic. The popularity of the myth just before and after the Persian war is shown by its appearance on nine archaic vases (Paul. Wiss. iii. 727) and by its frequency on red-figure vases. peri\\ *)/aqwn: cf. vi. 44. 2, 3. ou)k e)/xw ei)pei=n. This touch of scepticism a)/llws . . . e)ko/pase, ch. 191. 2).

Stein points out that the consecutive clause w(/ste ktl. must refer, not only to the words sitagwgw=n . . . a)riqmo/s, but also to the loss of war-ships and crews specified in ch. 190. 1. It looks as if the story of Ameinocles, noted in the margin by the author (or some early reader), had later been thrust into the text. For such sacrifices to appease the winds cf. ii. 119. 2, 3; Verg. Aen. ii. 116 f.; loc.) distinguishes absolutely between these attempts to appease the wind by sacrifice and prayer, and attempts to subdue it by force or by magic (Paus. ii. 34. 2 n. and Golden Bough, i. 220 f.); but surely there are in many of these cases, and especially here, clear traces of magic. If go/hsi be retained it must mean 'by wizards', while boh=|si means presumably sacro ululatu, and kataei/dontes (followed by the dative a)ne/mw|) would seem equivalent to e)paei/dw, 'to sing a spell to'. Again, the Magi as early as H. have begun to acquire in western eyes the character of sorcerers (cf. farmakeu/santes, 114. 1 and App. VIII. 3). How deeprooted this belief became may be seen from the use of the word and its derivatives, magic, &c., in Greek, Latin, and modern languages. Once more the words au)to\\s e)qe/lwn rather suggest as an alternative the compelling force of magic. teta/rth| h(me/rh|.

The clause *poseide/wnos . . . nomi/zontes reads like a marginal note, thrust later into the text. The name 'Saviour' is given to many Olympian deities (e.g. Apollo), but most often to Zeus. a)/krhn. The south-west corner of Magnesia, Cape Aeantium (Plin. *tisai/h a)/krh, Ap. Rhod. i. 568. Aphetae is generally placed just inside the Gulf of Pagasae near Cape Aeantium and opposite Cape Posidium, but Munro (J. H. S. xxii. 310) and Wace (J. H. S. xxvi. 145) would put it outside near Olizon. Pagasae was near the inmost recess of the gulf. The commoner tradition was that Heracles was left behind in Mysia on the Propontis, seeking for his darling Hylas, who had been carried off by the Naiads. a)fh/sein. The name Aphetae probably gave rise to the legend that the Argonauts put off from there. But since tradition was strong that the expedition started from Pagasae, a reason (u(dreusa/menoi) must be found for putting in at Aphetae. H. regards the putting out into the high sea as the true a)/fesis, not the voyage down the Pagasaean gulf; Hellanicus (St. Byz.) na\u00efvely assumed calls Aphetae near Pagasae. o( a)po\\ *ku/mhs. Stein argues from the title u(/parxos that Cyme must have been in 480 B.C. the capital of the Ionic satrapy, which included Aeolis (iii. 90. 1), but there is no clear evidence for a satrap of Ionia, independent of the satrap of Sardis (v. 25 n.). The title u(/parxos, though it often represents satrap (iii. 70, 120, 126; iv. 166; ix. 113), is also used for the commandant of an island (v. 27), a city, or fortress (vii. 105, 106, and perhaps vii. 33, 78; ix. 116), and for an undergovernor (Thuc. viii. 16; e.g. of Aeolis, Xen. Hell. iii. 1. 10) cf. Meyer, iii, \u00a7 29 n. Further, Cyme, at the time of the Ionic revolt, was ruled by a Greek tyrant, Aristagoras (v. 37), who commanded its fleet in the Scythian expedition (iv. 138). Probably, therefore, Sandoces was only governor of the town Cyme or of the district Aeolis.

Thessaly was famous for its horses (cf. v. 63), an emblem often used on the coins of its cities; cf. Schol. to Il. n.). *)hpidano/s (129. 2), like the Enipeus, rises in Mount Othrys. They join together in the Thessalian plain and then fall into the Peneius. The united stream, now the river of Pharsala, was called by the ancients sometimes Enipeus, sometimes Apidanus. H. names the western branch, now Sophaditiko, Apidanus, and the eastern, now Phersaliti, Enipeus. Further, since he limits the Apidanus to Achaia, he must have called the united stream the Enipeus. Thucydides (iv. 78) calls the western stream the Enipeus, as does Strabo 432. *)/alos or *(/alos, an ancient city (of the Myrmidons, Hom. Il. ii. 682) to the north-east of Mount Othrys, on the river Amphysus near the Pagasaean gulf (cf. 173. 1), was said to have been founded by Athamas (Strabo 433). Xerxes no doubt led his detachment from Larissa by Pherae to Phthiotian Thebes. If he marched thence along the coast to Lamia, he must have passed Halus, if he turned inland by Itonus, he would go within 60 stades of it (Strabo, l. c.). e)pixw/rion lo/gon, 'a local The story of Athamas, a tradition of pre-Hellenic Minyan origin, is associated with both the homes of the race, Orchomenus in Boeotia and the shores of the Pagasaean gulf (Iolcus). In Boeotia, 2 1/2 miles from Coronea, stood the shrine and statue of Zeus Laphystius, where legend said Phrixus had been saved by a ram from being sacrificed (Paus. ix. 34). Mount Laphystius stood over against Orchomenus, and on the opposite (eastern) side of Lake Copais there was, near Acraephia (viii. 135. 1 n.), a pedi/on *)aqama/ntion (Paus. ix. 24. 3), while Mount Ptoon was named after Ptous son of Athamas (Paus. ix. 23. 6). Near 31. 7; vii. 18. 12. Human sacrifices were regarded by the Greeks as impious and only practised by barbarians (cf. iv. Athamas' and the worshippers of Zeus Lycaeus in Arcadia; cf. Paus. viii. 38. At Orchomenus in Boeotia the priest of Dionysus Laphystius every year at the festival of the Agrionia pursued the young women of Minyan descent, known as Oleae, with a drawn sword, and within Plutarch's memory had slain one (Plut. Mor. 299 F; Quaest. Gr. 38). Again in Chios and Tenedos in early times a man was torn in pieces as a sacrifice to Dionysus Omestes (Porph. de Abstin. ii. 55), and for Attica cf. \u00a7 3 n. Human sacrifices were frequent among the Carthaginians (cf. ch. 167 n.; Plato, l. c.). The burning of their children in honour of Baal and Moloch was common among the Canaanites (Deut. xii. 31; xviii. 9, 10), and the Israelites frequently relapsed into the abominable practice (2 Kings xvii. 17; Jer. vii. 31; xix. 5; xxxii. 35). The kings themselves, Manasseh and Ahaz, made their children pass through the fire in the valley of Hinnom (2 Chron. xxviii. 3; xxxiii. 6), while the king of Moab when hard pressed 'took his eldest son and offered him for a burnt-offering (2 Kings iii. 27). Frazer (Golden Bough, pt. iii (the dying God), ch.6), argues from this and from Micah vi. 6, 7; Ezek. xx. 26, 31, as well as from the consecration of the firstborn among the Israelites (Exod. xiii. 1, 12; xxxiv. 19) and the feast of the Passover, that the Semitic custom was to sacrifice the firstborn as here, but that the custom was mitigated by the permission to redeem the child (Numb. xviii. 15; iii. 44 f.), or by the vicarious sacrifice of a lamb (cf. also Gen. xxii. 1-13). In the legend here the ram that saved Phrixus points to the substitution of a ram for the human victim. So at Salamis in Cyprus an ox took the place of a man, and at Syrian Laodicea a deer that of a maiden (Porphyry, de Abstin. ii. 54-6). At Potniae goats were substituted for boys (Paus. ix. 8. 2), and in a sacrifice to Munychian Artemis for a girl. But the man rescued must henceforth be treated as under God's ban and flee from his home; cf. the Italic ver sacrum Festus, p. 158, and especially 379. The legend here is an explanation of the ancient ceremony, and an attempt to find a reason for an abhorrent worship in the wickedness of men (cf. inf.). *fri/cw|. Apparently his sister Helle was unknown in the earliest form of the myth. Again in the later writers it is Ino, the wicked step-mother, who by getting the seed-corn roasted secretly caused a famine in the land; she then bribed the messenger sent to inquire of the Delphic oracle to say that the children of Nephele, the first wife of Athamas, must be sacrificed; but they were saved by the ram with the golden fleece who bore Phrixus to Colchis (Apollodorus, i. 9. 1). a)e/qlous. The word implies there was some feat to be performed (cf. i. 126. 2; iv. 10. 2), but H. writes obscurely here and elsewhere in the chapter, perhaps from sacred reserve. Possibly undetected entrance into the Prytaneion established the claimant's right to the enjoyment of the consecrated land (te/menos, \u00a7 4). lh/iton inf.). H. seems only to give us an account of the penalty in<*>olved in failure. The representative of the old Minyan house, if taken in the act of entering the town hall, was shut up there till the <*>east of the god came round, when he was led to the altar; but apparently he was as a rule allowed to escape and a ram sacrificed in his stead. Henceforth, however, he must live in exile under the ban of the god, and if he returned, the ceremony was repeated, and in times of calamity the human sacrifice really offered (cf. sup. \u00a7 1 n.). w(/s t' (sc.e)/legon, as with mete/peita d' w(/s, \u00a7 de\\ tou/toisi (e)/legon) w(s. If the text be sound e)chge/onto takes up the e)/legon already understood in the previous sentences, while the resumption of the singular instead of the plural fixes attention on the single victim in each particular case. In Hesiod's Eoae, Phrixus married Iophassa, daughter of Aeetes, with whom he took refuge, and had four sons, Phrontis, at Athens (Schol. Arist. Eq. 1136) at the festival of the Thargelia two men worthy of death were offered as farmakoi/, i. e. to make atonement for the people. The ceremony was annual, though perhaps the victims were only put to death in time of plague or famine. Athamas in this local legend is himself about to be offered, and so Sophocles in his *)aqa/mas stefanh/foros represented him as led to the altar, a victim to the vengeance of Nephele, but saved by Heracles (Schol. Arist. Nub. 257). But in the local myth it would seem that he was to suffer not for his wrongful treatment of Phrixus (a motive apparently borrowed by Sophocles from the Epic poets), but for a famine or plague due to the wrath of Zeus with the whole house, since he is saved by the son of Phrixus, Cytisorus, who thus brings down the wrath of heaven on himself and his posterity. This return of Cytisorus is an expedient necessary in this form of the myth to make Athamas, who had lost all his children, the ancestor of the race. In the ordinary form of the legend, Athamas after the escape of Phrixus goes mad, shoots one son Learchus, and forces Ino to throw herself and her other son Melicertes into the sea. Then he wanders over the earth till he finds a home in Thessaly in the Athamantian plain. *)axaiw=n: the men of the Thessalian Achaia; in the days of the myth the Minyae. *ai)/hs (cf. i. 2. 2; vii. 193. 2).

At the head of the Malian gulf, where the shore is very low and flat, the phenomenon is peculiarly remarkable' (Grundy, p. 277). For the topography in general cf. c. 176. 3 n. *trhxi/niai pe/trai: cliffs west of the Asopus ravine, forming the face of Mount Oeta near Trachis. prw/th *)antiku/rh. Lamia is in Achaia. Anticyra (to be distinguished from the better known Phocian city on the gulf of Corinth) was apparently at the place where the road crossed the Spercheius, but not at the mouth, the muddy marshy shore being unfit for habitation. e)c *)enih/nwn: cf. 132. 1 n. H. here gives us a route-map from the point of view of a traveller from Achaia (cf. ch. 176 n.; Grundy, 280), but we cannot test its accuracy as the coast-line and the courses of the rivers have changed since his day. The Dyras must be identified (Leake, Northern Greece, ii. 25. 6) with the Gourgopotamo, and the Melas with the Mavra Neria (Black water). Now the two streams join in the middle of the plain and together fall into the Spercheius. In ancient times they were 2 1/2 miles apart where the road, which must have made a wide d\u00e9tour to avoid the swamps at the head of the gulf, crossed them (Grundy, p. 281). kaiome/nw|. Heracles was burnt to death on a pyre on Mount Oeta; cf. ch. 176. 3 24-31. Apparently the lower town lay on the Thermopylae road (Grundy, p. 282), five stades from the Melas, west of the Asopus ravine. Thucydides (l. c.) makes it clear there was no real change of site, but apparently in Roman times (Strabo, Paus. l. c.) the name Heraclea was confined to the fortified hill (cf. Liv. l. c.) and the ruins of the lower town, six stades away (Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 313), were called Trachis. We should expect a measure of length after eu)ru/taton, but if so the numeral is corrupt, as 22,000 plethra = 420 miles. Hence Leake, Stein, and others take it as a measure of the surface of the plain of Trachis (over 5,000 acres), in which the king pitched his camp (ch. 201). pro\\s mesambri/hn: really east; cf. 176. 3 n. 'The defile of the Asopus issues abruptly on to the Malian plain nearly four miles west of the Western Gate of Thermopylae. Its bottom is merely formed of the stony river bed, at first some fifty yards wide, but rapidly contracting, until a little farther up the chasm it is only twelve feet wide between absolutely sheer cliffs from 700 to 900 feet high. This winding rift in the mountains continues for some three and a half miles from the entrance and then suddenly broadens out into a wide upland valley' (Grundy, p. 261). The Asopus (or Karvunaria) still flows through the plain at the foot of the hills (th\\n u(pw/rean) which bound it to the south, but now falls into the Spercheius, which has turned south through the alluvial deposit below Thermopylae. The Phoenix is 'a little stream which issues from the rocks of the west gate, whose bed is of a ruddy-brown colour, owing no doubt to its being impregnated with oxide of iron' (Grundy, p. 284). It now joins the Spercheius rather more than half a mile below the point where that stream receives the Asopus. It is almost exactly fifteen stades from the Middle Gate and principal hot-springs at Thermopylae. de/dmhtai. The word implies an artificially constructed road, probably as now on a causeway (cf. ii. 124. 3 n.), contrasted with o(do\\s tetmhme/nh (iv. 136. 2 n.). Anthele was placed by Leake on a great accumulation of d\u00e9bris brought down by the stream which issues from the great ravine about half a mile west of the hot springs. But this site is impossible, for it is traversed in every direction by ever-shifting branches of the torrent, so that anything built on it would soon be carried away, and it would be excessively malarious. It should be placed on the fairly level piece of land just inside the West Gate, under the old Turkish cavalry barracks. The temples and the seats of the Amphictyons may have been above the village on the projecting shelf of hill, where the barracks stand.

The fighting took place in defence of this Middle Gate (ch. 223), though on the last day the Greeks at first advanced into the broader part of the pass (ch. 223. 2), and finally fell back to the mound just behind the wall (ch. 225. 2). borh=n. The points here given as north and south should be east and west; cf. 176. 3 n. The Greek army under Leonidas at Thermopylae. H. enumerates only 3,100 Peloponnesians. Elsewhere (viii. 25. 1) he mentions Helots and seems to imply (vii. 229. 1) that each Spartan was attended by one Helot. But it is unlikely that the 4,000 Peloponnesians of the epigram (vii. 228. 1) are to be made up by adding Helots, whom neither the inscription nor the historian would be likely to include. Diodorus (xi. 4=Ephorus) adds 1,000 assigns that number of Perioeci, along with 300 Spartans, to Pausanias at Plataea. On the whole the addition of 900 or 1,000 Perioeci seems probable (Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 307). There was no connexion between Tegea and Mantinea, which, though lying near together on the upland plain of Tripolitza (i. 66. 2 f.), were always opposed to each other. On Mantinea cf. Paus. viii. 8 f. with Frazer, iv. 201 f., and on Tegea (i. 66. 2 n.) Paus. viii. 45 f. with Frazer, iv. 422 f. On Arcadian Orchomenus (to be distinguished from the Boeotian, viii. 34, ix. 16) cf.

Thuc. v. 57). Pausanias (x. 20. 2) absurdly estimates them at 'not more than 6,000', Diodorus (xi. 4) more sensibly at 1,000. On the attitude of the Locrians cf. c. 132. 1 n. e)c a)rxh=s ginome/nw|: statim nascenti. For the sentiment cf. i. 31. 3 n.; v. 4. 2 n.; vii. 46. iii. 610-25. 1 n. Munro (J. H. S. xxii. 313) most ingeniously suggests that the Locrians (of whom we hear nothing after this muster at Trachis) remained there as a garrison. We are told (ch. 201) that Xerxes commands all north of Trachis. Again he argues that the defensible road up the gorge of the Asopus into Doris (199 n.; viii. 31; ix. 66. 89) must have been held to prevent Xerxes turning Leonidas' position at Thermopylae. He concludes that the citadel of Trachis was for this purpose held by the Locrians since, as Grundy (pp. 262-4 n.) has shown, the defence of Thermopylae on later occasions against Brennus in 279 B. C. (Paus. x. 20 f.) in 224 B. C. (Polyb. ii. 52), in 208 B. C. (Polyb. x. 41, 42), and against the Romans in 191 B. C. (Liv. xxxvi. 15. 23, 24), regularly included the occupation of Heraclea. The full genealogy is given as a mark of the honour; so of Leotychides (viii. 131), Alexander of Macedon (viii. 139), and Pausanias (ix. 64), while that of Xerxes is introduced dramatically (ch. 11). For this ancient mark of honour cf. Homer, Il. x. 68patro/qen e)k geneh=s o)noma/zwn a)/ndra e(/kaston, and H. vi. n. For the genealogy cf. Paus. iii. 1-3, who for Eurycratides substitutes a second Eurycrates (iii. 3. 5). Eusebius (Chron. vol. i, pp. 221-5, ed.

For this festival cf. vi. 106. 3 n.; viii. 72. This year it took place just before the Olympic festival, which at that time lasted four whole days, i. e. in 480 Aug. 16-19 or 17-20, ending with the full moon Aug. 19 or 20. Leonidas' march was apparently just before the Carneia, and the fighting at Thermopylae near the end of August (Busolt, ii. 673-4). H. here as elsewhere represents the Peloponnesians as selfishly indifferent to the fate of Greece north of the Isthmus. But he does not represent the panic, which may have been real enough among the men, as infecting the general. Still less does he, as in the case of the fleet, speak of actual retreat (vii. 183; cf. viii. 4. 9; App. XX. 7). The Persians before Thermopylae. Xerxes and Demaratus. Is this contemptuous disregard of the scout the counterpart of Xerxes' dismissal of the Greek spies, ch. 146?

The representatives of the various states or tribes which composed the Amphictyony were charged with the whole jurisdiction of the league. They, along with the Hieromnemones, who administered the Delphic temple, met twice a year, in spring and autumn, at Thermopylae and Pylagorae seem to have been replaced after 280 B. C. by a)goratroi/ (C. I. A. ii. 551). That Thermopylae was the original meeting-place is shown by the names Pylagorae, Pylaea, which are applied to the deputies' meetings at both places, and by the existence of a shrine there to the eponymous hero Amphictyon (ch. 200 ad fin.). It is also confirmed by the geographical position of the twelve 'surrounding' (*)amfikti/ones = perikti/ones) tribes who belonged to the Amphictyony. To the incomplete list in Herodotus (vii. 132. 1 n.) we may add from Aeschines (de Fals. Leg. 116) Dorians, Busolt, i. 681 f.). As the Amphictyons were primarily concerned with religion, the treachery of Ephialtes may have been regarded as an offence against the gods; it may, however, be the earliest instance of Amphictyonic intervention in politics, later so ruinous. A meeting may possibly have been held immediately after the battle of Plataea (Bukatios, August-Sept.) 479 B. C., but the spring meeting of 478 B. C. is probably the one meant. For a full account of the Amphictyonic Council cf. Busolt, Griech. Staats. ii. 1292-1310. kath=lqe: returned home (v. 30. 4; cf. i. 60. 5), since Anticyra was a Malian city (ch. 198. 2 n.). The omission to fulfil this promise is the strongest argument for the view (Stein, Curtius, Kirchhoff) that H. intended to continue his work beyond 479 B. C. E. Meyer has, however, shown (F. i. 189 f.; cf. ii. 217) that a continuation beyond the transference of hegemony is impossible, and even one so far as this unlikely, in spite of Wilamowitz-M\u00f6llendorff, A. and A. i. 26 f.; Wachsmuth, Einl. 513. The omission is due not to incompleteness but to forgetfulness; cf. Introd. \u00a7 14; Hauvette, p. 56 f.; Busolt, ii. 614. If there was a traitor, the proclamation of the Amphictyons makes it probable Ephialtes was the man, and so later authors held (Paus. i. 4. 2; Diod. (Ephorus) xi. 8), but the path must have been known to Thessalians (cf. ch. 215) in Xerxes' train. Cf. Ctes. Pers. 24, p. 70 *qw/rac d' o( *qessalo\\s 'one might further urge against this view that Onetes was no Malian and so would not know the path, but this objection would have no weight, since he might have learnt of it if he had often visited the district.' For ei)dei/h a)/n cf. i. 70 ad fin. peri\\ lu/xnwn a(fa/s, 'the lighting of the lamps.' For Greek notes of time cf. iv. 181. 3 n. a)trapo/n. The track is rough and narrow, and often steep and rocky (Plut. Cato 13; Grundy, pp. 2. Ameiosis for 'pernicious', so long ago (cf. v. 88. 3 n.) had the path's capabilities for mischief been discovered by the Malians. Stein would, however, take ou)de\\n xrhsth/ with its ravine cf. ch. 199 n. It is generally assumed that Hydarnes began by ascending the Asopus ravine, and these words, though they should not be pressed (as by Grundy, p. 299), favour that assumption. If so, Trachis must have been previously captured by the Persians (cf. ch. 203. 2 n.). But Pausanias (x. 22. 8) starting above Trachis' Munro (J. H. S. xxii. 313) recognizes the original of the modern high road. But the other was the path by which Hydarnes, and afterwards Brennus, turned Thermopylae (Paus. x. 22. 1 and 8). It was easier for an army and led through the territory of the Aenianes, i. e. round the western end of the Trachinian cliffs. Presumably it passed behind Trachis and connected with the Anopaea path in the valley of the Asopus above the gorge. The expression to\\n *)aswpo\\n diaba/ntes (ch. 217. 1) in Herodotus distinctly supports Pausanias' view given above, which is adopted by Munro (l. c.). Munro explains his views on the path taken by Hydarnes and on the position and conduct of the Phocians in C. A. H. iv. 293-7 with map. *)ano/paia, 'upwards'; cf. Hom. Od. i. 320. Later writers call the mountain Callidromus (Plin. H. N. iv. 28; Strabo 428; after one of its peaks (Liv. xxxvi. 16). It is now named Saromata, while the path is said to be called *mounopa/ti. *)alphno\\n po/lin. More properly a village (kw/mh, ch. 176. 5) by name *)alphnoi/ (ch. 176. 2, 229. 1). It is suitably identified by Grundy (p. 290) with the remains of a walled acropolis on a hill which stands out into the plain . . . about half a mile beyond the East Gate. If this were captured, the defenders of Thermopylae would be cut off from supplies (ch. 176. 5) and all hope of retreat. *melampu/gou *kerkw/pwn. The Cercopes were two thievish mischievous dwarfs who stole the arms of Heracles while he slept on the rock here named and attacked him with them. But Heracles seized them and hung them head downwards from a pole he carried on his shoulders. In that position they jeered at the hinder parts of the hero tanned with exposure, and recognized in him the mela/mpugos against whom their mother had warned them. Heracles amused at their droll way of telling this tale released them. The story is very old, appearing in a poem ascribed to Homer by Suidas (yeu/stas, h)peroph=as, a)mh/xana archaic vases; cf. Lobeck, Aglaophamus, 1298. Probably some curious rocks fixed the place of the legend. For Heracles cf. 176. 3 n. to\\ steino/taton: cf. 176. 2 n. ta\\ *oi)tai/wn ta\\ *trhxini/wn. These geographical terms, as well as the phrase h( peri/odo/s te kai\\ a)na/basis (ch. 223. 1), are more natural if Hydarnes made the d\u00e9tour described by Pausanias (cf. ch. 216 n.). If he went right up the Asopus ravine, the heights held by the Oetaeans must be those above the left bank, and the Trachinian mountains must belong to the range of Mount Callidromus (Leake, N. Greece, ii. 55). a)krwthri/w| tou= o)/reos. Grundy 303) confidently places the Phocians 'at an old frou/rion which evidently guarded the pass in former days. . . . It is at the true summit of the pass . . . and accords with the little H. tells us of the scene, save that the trees hereabout are not oaks but firs.' 'When the Persians reached that point . . . they would have traversed two-thirds of the whole distance' (p. 311 n.). He would thus explain H.'s statement (ch. 223. 1) that the descent is much shorter than the way round and the ascent (but cf. sup.). Munro (J. H. S. xxii. 314), however, argues forcibly that o)/reos, ch. 216; to\\n ko/rumbon, ch. 218) cannot be pressed, since H., though he had doubtless travelled along the coast road, only refers vaguely to the Anopaea path. He thinks the Phocians defended Pausanias' 216 n.) as well as the Anopaea. He would therefore post them near the intersection of these paths, not far from the monastery Panagia. He holds that this is confirmed by the large number of oaks (ch. 218) in the forest just above it (Grundy, p. 302). The Phocian apology given by H. is but a lame one. At best they allowed themselves to be surprised and retired in confusion, leaving the way clear for Hydarnes. 'At worst they bartered away the safety of Hellas and the lives of their allies for the security of Delphi and its treasures' (Munro). H., here perhaps inspired by Delphi, does his best for them; he parades their spirited reply to the Thessalians, and their resistance in the fastnesses of Parnassus (viii. 29 f., and vindicates their bravery even in the camp of Mardonius (ix. 17-18). Clearly all this is an answer to current charges of Medism and cowardice (Munro, J.H.S. xxii. e)pi\\ temporal, 'and afterwards'; cf. ix. 35. 2. ou<*>=toi: i. e.

Doubtless H. regarded the epitaph (ch. 228. 3) as good evidence of the constancy of Megistias, in face of his own prediction of disaster. The idea that he might have escaped is confirmed by the escape of his son. But the incident is slender evidence for the inference drawn by H., that all who retreated did so by the king's orders (cf. inf.). It is clear that H. in these chapters aims at excusing the allies for deserting Leonidas by explaining that his death was fated by heaven and foretold by the oracle. This official explanation that Leonidas, like Decius Mus (Livy viii. 10; x. 28), devoted himself to save his country, was designed to make his defeat and death an omen of future victory. At the same time it was a convenient excuse for all concerned, for the Athenians who had urged pushing forward the line of defence to Artemisium and Thermopylae, for the Spartans who had sent but inadequate support to their heroic king, and for the Peloponnesian allies who had failed him in the hour of trial. But the oracle is plainly a vaticinium post eventum. It is inconsistent with the account of Leonidas' expedition previously given (ch. 202-7; for even 205. 2, toi=si e)tu/gxanon pai=des e)o/ntes, if not a later adscript (cf. J. H. S. xxii. 316 n.), only implies danger not self-immolation): it assigns no reason for the resolve of the Thespians to share his doom, and false or inadequate reasons for the Thebans' action, and even for that of Leonidas himself, since it was no disgrace for a Spartan commander to retreat when sound strategy demanded it (cf. Eurybiades, Pausanias), although perhaps his bodyguard were bound to remain with him to the last (cf. Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 317). Diodorus (xi. 4) carries out consistently the view here indicated in the oracle, but this completion of a process begun in H. shows us that the explanation is an afterthought gradually perfected by later ages. Grundy (op. cit. 306-9, 315-17; improving on a suggestion made by Bury in the Annual of the British School of Athens, ii. 102) argues strongly that the 2,800 allies dismissed were really detached to meet Hydarnes on the Anopaea, but failed to perform this duty. His great point is that otherwise the conduct of the Thespians (and of the Thebans) is inexplicable; cf. App. XX. 10, and for another suggestion Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 317-19. *qhbai=oi. Diodorus (xi. 9) omits the Thebans, as 2), who adds the Mycenaeans. e)n o(mh/rwn lo/gw|. Plutarch (de Malign. Her. 31, Mor. 865) rightly attacks the view that the Thebans could have been detained as hostages, a course which would only have added to Leonidas' own danger. Further, Plutarch here makes an effective apology for his countrymen; he urges that they sent 500 men under Mnamias to Tempe and the contingent demanded by Leonidas to Thermopylae, treating Leonidas with special honour. And with reference to the tradition that Leontiades and the other Theban captives were branded by Xerxes, Plutarch remarks (1) that Anaxandrus and not Leontiades was in command, (2) that branding would be a proof not of Medism but of fidelity to the Greek cause, (3) that the story was unknown before H. On the whole, in spite of Grundy's doubts (pp. 294-6) and Hauvette's rather half-hearted defence of H. (Herodote, pp. 360-4), we must admit that H. has been misled by malignant Athenian gossip, and that Leontiades, like Adeimantus, has suffered for the sins of his son (vii. 233 n.; Introd. \u00a7 30 c, d; J. H. S. xxii. 317). E. Meyer (F. ii. 211) holds the Thebans remained in order to desert with more effect, but it may well be that the Medizing oligarchy at Thebes furnished as their contingent men of the opposite party (Diod. xi. 4 th=s e(te/ras meri/dos) loyal to the Greek cause. The existence of such a party at Thebes seems proved (in spite of H. ix. 87) by the Theban orator's speech against Plataea (Thuc. iii. 62). For the dispatch of political opponents to the front to get rid of them, we may compare the attempt of the Corcyrean democrats to enlist their opponents for naval service (Thuc. iii. 75), the sending of 300 oligarchic knights to Thibron by the restored Athenian democrats (Xen. Hell. iii. 1. 4), and of oligarchs to Cambyses by Polycrates (H. iii. 44. 2 n.). Boeotian loyalists were doomed if Thermopylae was lost, and so would be likely to fight to the last. Cf. also clauses taken together and is opposed to to/te. Previously the Greeks had held the Phocian wall (ch. 176. 3 n.), at the Middle Gate, as their base, and, whenever pressed, had drawn back into the Narrows just in front of it; now they boldly attacked in the open ground further in front of the Middle Gate by the modern baths. The anacoluthic change of subject here and in \u00a7 3 (for . . e)ma/xonto (sup.) and must refer to the Greeks, to whom we again return abruptly, \u00a7 3 ad init.) has caused suspicions of a lacuna or dislocation in the text (Stein, Macan).

In the year 440 B. C. the remains of Leonidas were removed to Sparta, and on his tomb there a stele was set up inscribed with the names of the three hundred. There Pausanias (iii. 14. 1), and probably H., read their names. The stele may, however, be older than the hero's tomb (cf. Kirchhoff, Entstehungszeit, &c., 52 f.). The passage illustrates H.'s interest in mighty deeds (i. 1), and shows that he had reserves of knowledge besides the facts inserted in his history. *fratagou/nh: translated by Ctesias and later authors to *(rodogou/nh, Vrad being Persian for r(o/don.

A lion was later set up over the Thebans who fell at Chaeronea (Paus. ix. 40. 10 with Frazer, v. 209-10, and v. 141). There Pausanias interprets it of their ill-fated valour. Individual exploits. Epitaphs over the fallen. The coward Aristodemus. Surrender of the Thebans. H., who tells us of the heroic death of Leonidas with a simplicity which is the highest art, is rightly sparing in the record of exploits. For this wise reticence Plutarch (de Mal. Her. 32; Mor. 866) reproaches him with lack of patriotism. The epitaph might naturally be taken to mean that 4,000 Peloponnesians fell and were buried at Thermopylae, and so H. elsewhere (viii. 25. 2) assumes. It only says, however, that 4,000 Peloponnesians fought there, and this is true, if we add to the numbers he gives 1,000 Perioeci (202 n.). H. may have carelessly included the 700 Thespians (cf. toi=si pa=si and viii. 25. 1); but they were not Peloponnesians and had a separate stele with an epigram by a Megarian, Philaidas, since Strabo (425) quotes as the inscription on one of the myriads cf. c. 185. 3; 186. 1 n.

Each Spartan was attended by a Helot, who carried his baggage and his shield (hence u(paspisth/s, Xen. Hell. iv. 5. 14, and 8. 39). They were also employed as light-armed troops (ix. 10. 1, 28. 2, 29), and for menial duties (vi. 80. 1; ix. 80. 1). There is no reason to suppose there was a large number at Thermopylae, <*>hough some fell there (viii. 25. 1). The 4,000 slain (viii. 25. 2) are better explained as a misunderstanding (cf. ch. 202 n., 228. 1 n.), and light-armed Helots would be useless at Thermopylae owing to the nature of the ground, even if their fidelity were above suspicion. o(/kws h)/gage='when he had led him'; cf. ix. 66. 2. Elsewhere it is iterative, as a rule with optative (i. 11. 1). lipoyuxe/onta elsewhere (Thuc. iv. 12; Xen.

Lac. ix. 4-6) and Plutarch (Agesilaus, ch. 30). The Spartans who surrendered at Sphacteria were much more lightly punished (Thuc. v. 34); those who lost the battle of Leuctra escaped scot-free (Plut. l. cf. 71. e)n prw/toisi: among the first of the Greeks: for the phrase cf. viii. 94. 4; ix. 86. 1, for the facts ch. 132. 1 n. e)/stican basilh/ia. For branding cf. ch. 35. 1 n. It is clear that the Thebans here are branded in the forehead with the king's mark as slaves (cf. drape/ths e)stigme/nos,Arist.

Gal. the placing of the arms or crest of the city on captives or galley-prow figuring on coins of Samos about the date of its capture by Athens (440 B. C.), and the free horses on a Syracusan coin, struck soon after the Athenian expedition to Sicily, while the owl is the regular arms or crest of Athens. It would seem, however, that the Athenians would brand with an owl, the Samians with the galley (so Aelian, V. H. ii. 9; Duris, fr. 59; F. H. G. ii. 483). Thucydides (ii. 2-6) gives us a fuller and more correct account of the Theban surprise of Plataea in the spring of 431 B. C. (March or April). He corrects H. on the following points. (1) The number of the Thebans was not 400, but rather more than 300, of whom 180 were taken captive and executed. (2) Eurymachus was not in command (though he planned the coup) but two Boeotarchs, Pythangelus and Diemporus. For the animus of this passage cf. Introd. \u00a7 30 a, and ch. 222 n.

If Messenia and Cynuria are included in Laconia there are said to have been about a hundred Lacedaemonian cities; sixty are known. *lakedai/moni: i. e. Laconia; cf. vi. 58. 2. o)ktakisxili/wn. This estimate (defended by Macan (ad loc.); cf. Grundy, Thuc. 213 f.) agrees with the tradition that Lycurgus assigned 9,000 lots to Spartiates (Plut. Lyc. 8); with H.'s statement (ix. 10. 1, 28. 2) that 5,000 Spartiates fought at Plataea. But in 371 B. C. there seem not to have been more than 1,500 (Xen. Hell. vi. 1. 1, 4, 15, 17; Ages. ii. 24), and in Aristotle's time (cf. l. c.) not 1,000. Hence most modern writers, following Beloch (Bev\u00f6lkerung, p. 131 f.; cf. Klio vi. 58-73), regard H.'s numbers as exaggerated. In the Peloponnesian war at Mantinea, 418 B. C. (Thuc. v. 68), and at the battle of Corinth, 394 B. C. (Xen. Hell. iv. 2. 16), Spartiates and Perioeci together amounted to some 6,000. Isocrates puts the number of Spartiates in early times at only 2,000, and contrasts Sparta with muri/androi po/leis (Panath. 255 f.). a)/lloi: i. e. Perioeci, who contributed at least half the hoplite force of Sparta, e. g. 5,000 at Plataea (ix. 11. 3, 28. 2). The value of Cythera as a naval base of operations against Laconia is obvious, and Tolmides is said to have seized the island in 455 B. C. (Paus. i. 27. 5; Bus. iii. 325 f.). Hence it is quite unnecessary to suppose that this passage was written after, or even shortly before, the Athenians occupied it in 424 B. C. (Thuc. iv. 53); cf. further, Introd. \u00a7 9. For Chilon cf. i. 59. 2 n. oi)khi/ou, 'a war of their own close to their own doors'; cf. v. 23. 2 n.; Thuc. i. 118. tw=n: some emendation, such as B\u00e4hr's, is necessary.

The genitive is used, not the accusative in apposition, to show that a reason for the command is given; cf. iv. 97. 6. With the treatment of the body of Leonidas (cf. ix. 78) we may compare that of the corpse of Amasis by Cambyses (iii. 16). Artaxerxes similarly maltreated that of his brother, the younger Cyrus (Xen. Anab. i. 10. 1; iii. 1. 17), and the Parthian general or Suren, that of M. Crassus (Plut. Crass. 32). Though the story is in marked contrast with the generous treatment of Pytheas (vii. 181; viii. 92), these parallels make it unlikely that it is a Greek invention as contended by Wecklein (Ber. Bayer. Akad. (1876), p. 285) and Duncker (vii. 258). The whole chapter is with reason regarded as an interpolation by Kr\u00fcger, followed by Abicht, Gomperz, Van Herwerden, and Macan. There is no proper transition to Bk. VIII, a fact which leads Stein to suspect an omission in the text. The formula introducing the digression is strange, but as Macan points out, this anecdote is not intended to be a resumption of the main thread of the story but to supply an omission, and the words mean 'I will here return to a place in the story where before I was guilty of an omission'. The author is excusing himself for putting in the story here, where the only ground for its appearance is its connexion with Demaratus, instead of in ch. 220, where it was required to explain how the Spartans had early information of the intended Persian invasion. Kr\u00fcger also regards as suspicious the postponement of the actual story in favour of a disquisition on Demaratus' motives and the author's assertion that the motive was ill-will, and subsequent willingness to leave it an open question. Such hesitation, however, may be easily paralleled from the genuine work of H. (cf. ii. 123. 1; v. 45. 2). Kr\u00fcger's arguments from language are stronger. The asyndeton e)pu/qonto is intolerable, to\\ e)s *delfou\\s di/ptuxa in this sense is late, and elsewhere H. uses de/ltos (viii. 135); e)pe/thce and e)kkna=n nor summa/xetai (middle) till Xenophon, or o(dofu/lac till Eustathius. It may be said that some of these strange words are quoted by Pollux (Onom. x. 58) from H., and that the story, though without names, goes back at least to (350 B. C.) Aeneas Tacticus (l. c.), but these stylistic peculiarities and late words surely betray a forger. The existence of an anonymous version of the story in Aeneas, and a variant in Trogus Pompeius (Justin, ii. 10. 12-17), in which 'a sister of Leonidas' figures, and Demaratus' motive is patriotic, really discredit the story, as suggesting that the narrative as here given is a gradual and relatively late fabrication (Macan). It is inferior to the similar stories of Harpagus (i. 123. 3, 4) and Histiaeus (v. 35) on which it may have been modelled. Finally, the extremely unfavourable impression given of Demaratus seems un-Herodotean. It appears highly probable that some part of the text connecting Books VII and VIII was early lost, and into the gap this chapter was thrust by an interpolator. Even if it be a genuine fragment it is misplaced here. BOOK VIII The story of Artemisium. 1-3 The fleet and its leadership. 4, 5 Bribery of Themistocles. 6-11 First engagement. 12, 13 Storm, wreck of Persian squadron off Euboea. 14-17 Second and third days' fighting. 18-23 Retreat of the Greek and advance of the Persian fleet. Throughout there is a close parallel and connexion between the accounts of the operations on sea and on land and of the forces at Thermopylae and Artemisium. First, we have the description of the double position (vii. 175-7) supplemented by a more detailed topography of Thermopylae (vii. 198-201), secondly the story of the movements of the fleets (vii. 179-95) and a brief account of the march of Xerxes' army (vii. 196-7), finally a narrative of the struggle at Thermopylae (vii. 202-33) and of the contemporary (ch. 15) seafights at Artemisium (viii. 1-23). Yet, as it stands, the opening of Book VIII is abrupt and not connected with the end of Book VII. Probably the connexion and implied contrast between the land and sea forces has been obscured by the later insertion of ch. 234-9 (Macan). The summary of the Greek forces here given is parallel to that prefixed to the fighting at Thermopylae (vii. 202). Similar lists are given of the Greek fleets before Lade (vi. 8 n.) and before Salamis (viii. 43 f.), and of the Greek army before Plataea (ix. 28). But whereas at Plataea H. follows the line of battle from right to left (as at Lade from east to west), and at Salamis adopts a geographical order (Peloponnese, northern Greece, islands, &c.), here he arranges the states according to the number of ships furnished (ch. 2. 1), thus incidentally justifying the claim of Athens to command at sea (ch. 3). ne/as. Triremes, line-of-battle ships, excluding not only transports (vii. 97) but even penteconters, which are not included in the total by H. (viii. 2. 1, 48), though Diodorus (xi. 12) carelessly speaks of 280 triremes. For the Plataeans cf. vi. 108. For the Athenian cleruchs in Chalcis cf. v. 77. 2 n. *lakedaimo/nioi.

Reiske's o(/son, adopted by many editors, is bad, since there is more point in calling attention to the order in which the contingents are arranged (ch. 1 n.) than to the obvious fact that the strength of each contingent has been given. Hence ei)/rhtai should be emended to ei)re/atai (vii. 81, 82) or regarded as a plural (cf. Bechtel, Ion. Ins. 18. 17 ai( di/kai e)n toi=s no/mois ei)/rhtai): 'They have been named according to the number of ships supplied by each.' Cf. for the parallel use of w(s e(/kastoi, viii. 21. 2, 67. 2; ix. 49. 3; cf. A. G. Laird, Cl. Rev. xviii. 97-8. The traditional position of Sparta made the Greeks (especially the Peloponnesians who formed the kernel of the league, though only furnishing 113 ships) willing to accept her leadership, when they would follow no other state. That Athens made some claim to naval leadership and withdrew in face of the opposition of the allies, is highly probable. Yet the assumption that it was natural that Athens should lead at sea and Sparta on land (vii. 157 n., 161 n.) belongs to the years after 478 B. C. The magnanimity of Athens in yielding up the command is lauded by Isocrates (Paneg. 72), Lycurgus (in Leoc. 70), Aristides (Panath. i. 217, Dind.); it is ascribed to the wise advice of Themistocles (Plut. Them. 7). The claims of Athens were asserted later by her orators, especially in the funeral orations in the Ceramicus, of which we have echoes in vii. 161; ix. 27 (Meyer, Forsch. ii. 219 f.). But at the time it must have been clear that to divide the command would be dangerous from a military point of view. kat' a)rxa/s: probably 481 B. C., autumn.

No doubt the Peloponnesian sailors may have grumbled, but Eurybiades could not leave Leonidas in the lurch. Cf. App. XX, \u00a7 6; Grundy, p. 329; Munro, J. H.

This story is repeated with additions from Phanias by Plutarch (Them. 7), though attacked in de Herod. Malign. 34. It is in accord with the charges made against Themistocles (ch. 112) elsewhere, but is probably an invention of the time when Themistocles had fled to Persia and had been proclaimed a traitor. Such stories necessarily rest on scanty evidence and are quite unverifiable. The bias of H. (i. e. of his sources) against him, as against Adimantus, is patent (Introd. \u00a7 31). Themistocles is the master of craft and wiles (ch. 110, 124), Aristides the true patriot (79, 95). Special reasons for suspecting this story may be found in the improbability of the Euboeans squandering so large a sum as thirty talents on a subordinate when they might have bought the commander-in-chief cheap (five talents) (cf. Bauer, Them. p. 25); in the fact that Adimantus, who is supposed to have been bribed by Themistocles, continues to be his chief opponent (ch. 59 f.), and that Eurybiades (cf. \u00a7 1 n.) must surely have intended to hold his position at Artemisium whether bribed or not (Munro, l. c.); and finally in the fact that the Euboeans made no use of the opportunity they are supposed to have bought so dearly (ch. 19). h)/spaire: here only 'resisted': the literal meaning (i. 111. 3; ix. 120. 1) is 'struggled convulsively'. There is an implied threat that Adimantus might be accused of treachery and corruption; cf. ix. 41. 3. For a more elaborate story of the same kind cf. Plut.

App. XX, \u00a7 6 (2)), or from the fact that the Greek fleet ran before the storm for shelter (Grundy, G. P. W., p. 324-5). au)lisqe/ntas.

Many voluntarily did more than this (Thuc. vi. 31), but to undertake the whole expense was a proof of great wealth and liberality. dihkosi/oisi: i. e. the whole crew; cf. vii. 184. 1. nekrw=n e)pekra/teon: this was regarded as a sign of victory (i. 82. 5 f.; Thuc. iv. 97 f.). drhsmo\\n dh/, 'at length they resolved'; for the phrase and previous resolution cf. ch. 4. 1 n.

Ar. Probl. 1, least three prophets called Bacis, one being Attic and one Arcadian (Schol. Arist. Pax 1071), but the most famous and oldest, said to have been inspired by the nymphs (Arist. Pax 1071; Paus. iv. 27. 4; x. 12. 11), came from Eleon (v. 43 n.) in Boeotia. A collection of oracles, similar to those ascribed to Laius (v. 43 n.), Orpheus, and Musaeus (vii. 6. 3 n.), passed under his name from the end of the seventh century, and was carefully edited under the Pisistratidae. Nevertheless many later forgeries and interpolations were inserted in it (ch. 77. 1 n., 96. 2; ix. 43). Bacis was parodied by Aristophanes (ch. 77. 1 n.), but held in reverence by Pausanias (l. c.) and Cicero (Div. i. 18. 34). proesa/canto (sc.si/tia kai\\ pota/ (i. 190. 2; v. 34. 1) for a siege): cf. v. 34. 1 n.

It is most unlikely that such an obvious fraud was ever attempted: the storyis a Greek invention intended to bring Xerxes into contempt. The Greek dead, according to the story, were all gathered together, probably on the hillock where the last stand was made, the barbarians left scattered about the pass. The number 4,000 (if genuine) must be derived from that given by the inscription for the Peloponnesian combatants (vii. 228. 1 n., 202 n.): since most of these had retired in safety, H. brings in Helots (vii. 229. 1 n.) to make up his erroneous total. au)to/moloi. These Arcadians have been identified with the inhabitants of Caryae on the borders of Laconia, who are said to have been all killed or enslaved for Medism (Vitruvius, i. 1. 5, explain ing 'Caryatides' in architecture). They would seem, however, to be a band of adventurers seeking service as mercenaries; the Arcadians, like the Swiss at the end of the Middle Ages, often earned a livelihood thus (Thuc. iii. 34; vii. 57, 58). *)olu/mpia a)/gousi. The anecdote, whether true or false, goes to prove that the fighting at Thermopylae took place at the time of or just after the Olympic games, i. e. the end of August; cf. vii. 206. 1 n.; the prize.' In early days, as in the Homeric games (Il. xxiii), more substantial prizes were given, but at this time the four national festivals were all a)gw=nes stefani=tai. The victor, however, received more material rewards from his own city, e. g. a sum of money, or the right to maintenance for life in the Prytaneum, as well as Proedria. Tritanaechmes (cf. vii. 82, 121. 3) speaks in the same spirit as his father Artabanus (iv. 83; vii. 46. 4 n.). The dramatic warning resembles that given to Croesus (i. 71). The feud between Thessaly and Phocis. For Thessalian enmity to Phocis cf. vii. 176. 4, and for Thessalian allies vii. 132. 1 n. The date of this war cannot be fixed, but is probably after 510 B. C. Plutarch (Mor. 244) implies that the Thessalians had previously subdued the Phocians and set up tyrants in their cities; these the Phocians slew when they revolted. The Thessalians in revenge stoned 250 Phocian hostages and then invaded Phocis through Locris. Pausanias (x. 1) makes the war begin with (1) the disaster to the Thessalian cavalry described in ch. 28, and end with the stratagem of Tellias given here (4). Between the two he inserts (2) the destruction of a picked Phocian force of 300 by the Thessalian horse, and (3) a desperate resolve of the Phocians to conquer or to die themselves, and to devote their wives and families to the flames, which leads up to a brilliant victory (cf. Plut. Mor. 244). Though Pausanias is a little confused, these stories seem to belong to this war, and not to an earlier struggle before 570 B. C., when the Thessalians were defeated near Thespiae by the Boeotians (Plut. Camillus 19; cf. de Mal. Her. 33). For full criticism and reconstruction cf. Macan, ad loc. e)s to\\n *parnhsso/n: cf. ch. 32. 1. *telli/hn: probably of the family of the Telliadae (ix. 37. 1; cf. ix. 33. 1 n.). Abae, too, was an oracle of Apollo; cf. i. 46. 2; viii. 33 n., 134. 1. h( deka/th: the customary tithe; cf. v. 77. 4 and c. 26. 2 to\\n dido/menon ste/fanon. sunestew=tes: probably like peri/ local, 'standing face to face,' but with the implied sense of hostility, which the word bears elsewhere in H. For a full description cf. Paus. x. 13. 7. Heracles and Apollo were struggling for the tripod, Leto and Artemis trying to calm Apollo, and Athena Heracles. The struggle for the tripod was represented also in the gable of the Cnidian or Siphnian treasury at Delphi (Frazer, Paus. v. 274), in relief at Lycosura (Paus. viii. 37. 1), and is frequent on vases (Baum. i. 463). Pausanias also tells us (x. 1. 10) of other offerings for the victory numbered (3) above. poliorke/ontas governs e(wutou/s and agrees with pezo/n (collective); cf. vii. Paus. v. 442-5) was founded by the pre-Hellenic Hyantes when expelled from Boeotia (Strabo 401, 424). It lay near Abae on the road leading from Thessaly through Opuntian Locris to the valley of the Cephisus near Parapotamii. The festival Elaphebolia there celebrated to Artemis was believed to commemorate the victory here described.

Herod. 35) attacks H. fiercely for this judicious remark. The historian, in spite of his tenderness for the Phocians (vii. 218 n.), is not blind to their failings. Advance of the Persians through Doris, Phocis, and Boeotia. H. writes as if the whole Persian army used this road through the Asopus ravine (vii. 199 n.), which, 'after winding through the mountains some three and a half miles, suddenly broadens out into a wide upland valley behind the range of Oeta, from which there is a long but not difficult passage to the Dorian plain (Grundy, p. 261). [Probably this approach from Malis is the 'narrow strip' of Doris.] Thence this route, which entirely avoids Thermopylae, passes along the valleys of the Pindus and the Cephisus to Phocis and Boeotia. But it may be deemed certain that Xerxes also used the coast-road through Thermopylae, which turns inland near Atalanta in Locris and reaches Parapotamii by Hyampolis (ch. 28). This is the only route suitable for a force of cavalry and a large baggage train. It would take the invaders to Hyampolis and Abae (ch. 33), which lie off the Doris route, the only one mentioned by H. Pro bably he regarded the use of the main coast-road as an obvious sequel of the capture of Thermopylae, which need not be explicitly stated in his narrative. Two other rough routes, which lead from Alpeni and Thronium on the Locrian coast to Elateia and the valley of the Cephisus, may possibly have been used by the Persians. For the connexion of Dryopis (Doris) with the Dorian invasion cf. i. 56 nn. Tithorea H. seems to regard as merely a mountain peak above the city Neon, and so Pausanias (x. 32. 8) understood him. But the heights in the immediate neighbourhood can easily be scaled from Daulis, and Plutarch (Sulla 15) distinctly the slopes of Parnassus expanded into the city Tithora, shown by late inscriptions to be the modern Velitsa, which is still surrounded by fine Greek walls. This town seems to have superseded the older Neon (perhaps *palaia\\ *qh/ba in the plain three and a half miles away), which was destroyed after the Phocian war (Paus. x. 2. 4, 3. 2). For a full description cf. Frazer, v. 402-7. Amphissa (Salona), the chief town of the Locri Ozolae (Thuc. iii. 101; Paus. x. 38. 4), lay at the north-west end of the Crisaean plain. Remains of Greek towers, walls, and gateways may still be seen in the extensive Frankish fortifications of Salona (Frazer, Paus. l. c.). *drumo/s: called Drymaea (Paus. x. 33. 12), on the south face of a small hill projecting from the chain bounding the valley of the Cephisus on the north, with well-preserved walls and towers, five miles north-west of Amphiclea; cf. Frazer, ad loc. *teqrw/nion (Paus. l. c.): Moulki, in the plain north of the Cephisus, defended on three sides by its tributary the river of Dernitsa; cf. Frazer, ad loc. *)amfi/kaia: Amphiclea (Paus. x. 33. 9; cf. Frazer), now Dadi, at the foot of an outlying spur of Parnassus. H., giving (ch. 33-5) fifteen names, seems to have mentioned every town in the district: indeed *pedie/as and *trite/as are otherwise unknown names, and Plutarch only speaks of thirteen cities laid waste (de Malig. Herod. 35). Abae stood on a nearly isolated rocky hill over 500 feet high a mile south-west of Hyampolis (28 n.). The scanty remains of the temples of Apollo are about a quarter of a mile to the north-west of the hill; cf. Paus. x. 35. 1-3; Frazer, ad loc. Though the burning of the temple is affirmed also by Pausanias, who adds that it was not restored, it is difficult to see how such complete destruction can be reconciled with the preservation of the statues, apparently dedicated earlier (viii. 27) but seen by H. after this time, or with the consultation of the oracle by the Carian Mys (viii. 134). Probably the gold and silver were carried off and the woodwork burned, but the Greek temple had no arched vault to spread destruction in its fall. Its walls and pillars would suffer comparatively little from fire and could be easily restored. Parapotamii lay on a low hill above the defile leading from Phocis to Boeotia. The pass through which the Cephisus flows is about a mile and a half long and a quarter of a mile in width (Frazer, v. 419). Near the southern end of the pass lay Panopeus (Paus. x. 4. 1; Frazer), the border town of Phocis, only twenty stades from Chaeronea, and like that town on the southern edge of the plain. The road running south-east leads thence to Chaeronea and the territory of Orchomenus, that westward to Daulis and thence by the Schiste (ch. 35. 1 n.) to Delphi. diatetagme/noi: 'dispositi per urbes'; cf. vii. 178. 1.

From Daulis (Paus. x. 4. 7, with Frazer) the road skirts Mount Parnassus for about five miles. Where it turns west it is met by the road from Thebes; these with the road to Delphi form the famous 'Schiste or Triodos' (Soph. O. T. 730, 733) where Oedipus slew Laius. Thence it ascends a deep valley enclosed by the steep and rocky slopes of Mount Parnassus (north) and Mount Cirphis (south). Near the top of the pass are the ruins of a Greek fortress, perhaps Aeolidae. Thence one road leads down the valley to Cirrha and Amphissa, another to the right along the steep slopes of Parnassus to Delphi (Paus. x. 5. 3 f., with Frazer). ta\\ *kroi/sou a)naqh/mata: cf. i. 50 f., 92. From the stadium at the north-west end of Delphi an ancient steep and rugged path, 'the evil staircase,' ascends in a zigzag cut in the rock, including more than a thousand steps, over a ridge to a small upland plain. On the east are the upper slopes of Parnassus, on the north a lower line of hills. In the face of the most easterly of these next Parnassus is the Corycian cave, about 500 feet above the plateau, perhaps eight miles (three hours) from Delphi. It was sacred to Pan and the Nymphs (Paus. x. 32. 7; Inscr.). The great chamber is some 200 feet long, 90 feet broad at the widest point, and 20 to 40 feet high. Dripping water has formed a grove of stalagmites and stalactites. It must have provided an admirable refuge, being connected by a narrow passage with an inner cave. tou= profh/tew: cf. vii. 111. 2 n. a)pw/rwn, 'saw from afar' (ix. 69. 2). They only reached the temple of Athene Pronaia (\u00a7 3, ch. 39 n.) near the eastern entrance of the town, while the temple of Apollo stood on a high terrace beyond a valley in the north-western part of Delphi. For the portent of the arms cf. those of Heracles at Thebes before Leuctra (Xen. Hell. vi. 4. 7; Diod. xv. 53; Polyaen. ii. 3. 8). In the repulse of the Gauls (279 B. C.) besides Phylacus, Pyrrhus son of Achilles and two Hyperborean heroes played a part (Paus. x. 23. 2). For similar appearances cf. Frazer, ad loc., and App. XVIII. 1. 3 (Marathon). The road is the sacred way coming from Daulis, the modern road from Arachova. The temple of Athene Pronaia is the last of the five at the Marmaria just outside the sanctuary (Paus. x. 8. 7; Dem. in Aristogit. 34). It is now identified with a temple in antis built of local limestone. For the epithet Pronaia cf. i. 92. 1 n. The pool of Castaly is in a rock cut basin 36 feet long by 10 feet wide, to the right of the road near the mouth of a gorge in the rocks. Among the olives in the glen below are some large masses of reddish-grey rock, which might be those said to have come hurtling from the cliffs above. Facing each other across the gorge rise two perpendicular cliffs with peaked summits (Phaedriades; cf. Diod. xvi. 28), the eastern being called Hyampeia, the western Nauplia. H.'s account of the deliverance of Delphi is obviously a temple legend told the author by the Delphic priests (cf. 35. 2, 39. 1, 2), who would also have furnished the inscription recorded by Diodorus (xi. 14). That the legend was widely accepted is shown by its repetition with minor variations when the Gaul attacked Delphi, 279 B. C. (Paus. x. 23). The stories in Ctesias (Pers. 25, 27, p. 70) of an attempted sack by Mardonius who fell there (after Plataea but while Xerxes is marching to Athens) and of actual spoliation by the eunuch Matacas dispatched by Xerxes after his return to Sardis deserve no credit. Even H.'s story is open to grave suspicions. The oracle had certainly shown strong signs of favouring the Mede (cf. vii. 140, 148, 169), and the bulk of the tribes forming the Delphic Amphictyony (cf. vii. 132 n.) had now joined Xerxes; it would therefore be impolitic (cf. Meyer, iii. p. 384) for the Persians to plunder Delphi. This fact they seem themselves to recognize though perhaps not till a year later (ix. 42). The certain fact seems to be that the Persians could have plundered Delphi and did not do so; tradition strongly supports the view that a Persian force marched on Delphi. Three interpretations have been given of this difficult problem. 1. Xerxes, seeing that Delphi, tempted perhaps by the promised tithe (vii. 132), wavered (cf. the encouragement to the Greeks vii. 178, 189), and the second answer to Athens (vii. 141-3), sent a detachment to take it, which was repulsed on the difficult mountain-road by the Phocians aided by a storm and some manifestations held to be supernatural. Since the priests forbade any defence (cf. 36) and Delphi was an open town, Xerxes might have sent quite a small force expecting no resistance (Duncker vii. 276 n.; Grundy, pp. 349, 350). Afterwards the Persians saw how impolitic any attack on Delphi was. 2. The Persians who attacked Delphi were a mere hand of disorderly plunderers acting without orders (Pomtow, Jahr. kl. Philol. cxxix. 227 f.). This is, however, opposed to H.'s statement, ch. 34, 35. 3. The force was sent to protect Delphi from casual plunderers (Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 320), but was perhaps harassed by Phocian zealots from Mount Parnassus. This view assumes that Delphi had come to a definite agreement with Xerxes (Curtius, Wecklein, Meyer), and afterwards put out the legend to cloak its Medism. Casson (C.R. xxviii. 145-51, xxxv. 144) suggests that Xerxes sent a force to Delphi to make an inventory of the temple treasures. The Greek fleet at Salamis. Evacuation of Attica (41). The navy list (42-8). Council of war (49). u(pokathme/nous: transitive here only, 'awaiting'; cf. vii. 27. 1. E. Meyer (iii, \u00a7 222) holds that this idea only grew up after the campaign of Plataea, and that immediately after Thermopylae no one would have contemplated a pitched battle in Boeotia with Xerxes (cf. App. XX, \u00a7 2). The Spartans had no doubt promised that Attica should be defended, but they meant to fulfil their promise at Thermopylae and not on Mount Cithaeron. And whatever the 'man in the street' at Athens may have expected, the leaders must have known that resistance in Boeotia was out of the question, and must have ordered the evacuation of Attica as soon as they heard that Thermopylae was lost, since the people had time to emigrate en masse before Xerxes reached Attica. *troizh=na. may note that the places of refuge were all commanded by the Athenian fleet, so that the refugees would not become hostages in the hands of the Peloponnesians (Grundy, 353). tw=| xrhsthri/w|. The advice to flee given vii. 140. 2, 141. 4. This snake was known as the legend Erichthonius (Erechtheus) was the sacred serpent (Paus. i. 24. 7; J. H. S. xxi. 329); later he becomes the child of Earth and foster son of Athena hidden in a chest, being half-man, half-serpent (Hyginus, fab. 166), or a child guarded by serpents (Eur. Ion 20 f., 267-74; Apollodorus iii. 14. 6). For further discussion of the myths of Erichthonius cf. Frazer on Paus. i. 18. 2; Harrison, Mythology of Athens, xxvi-xxxvi; and on the deity as a snake Harrison, Prolegomena to Greek Religion, pp. 17-21, 325 probably 55; v. 72. 3 n. w(s e)o/nti.

H.'s figures, 180 as against 198 from all other states, compare favourably with those of the Attic orator in Thucydides (i. 74), a little less than two-thirds of 400, and with those of Demosthenes (de Cor. \u00a7 238), 200 out of 300. mou=noi. At Artemisium the Plataeans had helped to man the Athenian ships (ch. 1); now the Athenians are said not only to have made good their heavy losses there (ch. 16 and 18), but to have filled the places of the Plataeans. According to Aristotle (Ath. Pol. ch. 23; cf. Cic. de Off. i. 22. 75) the Areopagus enabled the fleet to be fully manned by providing eight drachmas for each man; Cleidemus (fr. 13, F. H. G. i. 362) ascribed this, too, to a stratagem of Themistocles, but his story deserves little credit (Plut. Them. 10). *kranaoi/, 'dwellers on the rock, or on the height' (kra (=ka/r, head) and? nai/w). ai( *kranaai/ and with special reference to the Acropolis, the po/lis proper (cf. 6); Lysist. 481.

Hence he does not make the earth-born Cecrops founder of the Acropolis and first king of Athens (Thuc. ii. 15), as do most Attic antiquaries, and Cranaus his successor (Paus. i. 2. 6), but apparently reverses the order. On these old Attic genealogies cf. Harrison, Mythology and Mon. of Athens, xxi f. *)erexqe/os: cf. ch. 55. We might expect *)erexqei=dai (cf. Pind. Isth. ii. 19, &c.), instead of *)aqhnai=oi, but the name *)aqhnai=oi might well be given to the people of Erechtheus (Erichthonius), the foster son of Athena (Hom. Il. ii. 548). strata/rxew: to Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 3. 2; cf. Paus. i. 31. 3) he was polemarch and (Philoch. fr. 33; F. H. G. i. 389; Strab. 383) gained the victory for the Athenians in the war between Erechtheus (his grandfather) and Eumolpus of Eleusis. The accepted tradition represented him as of foreign origin, the son of Xuthus or Apollo and Creusa daughter of Erechtheus, and king of the Aegialees (v. 68. 2; vii. 94). Yet his sons give their names to the four old Attic (Ionic) tribes (v. 66. 2 n.). Clearly Ion played too important a part in old Attic mythology to be altogether ignored, but he could not be fitted into the received genealogy of the Attic kings, which ran in unbroken line from Cecrops to Theseus. Hence his ambiguous position (Strabo, Pausanias, l.c.) and foreign origin, which is strongly affirmed by Euripides. The Bacchiadae of Corinth are said to have claimed suzerainty over Megara till Orsippus headed his countrymen in a successful revolt a little after 720 B. C. (Paus. i. 44. 1, with Frazer, Hicks, No. 1). Leucas and Ambracia, as well as Anactorium, were founded by sons of Cypselus, and Potidaea by a son of Periander (Appendix XVI), but the theory that there is a separate list of Corinthian allies either here or on the inscription at Delphi (ix. 81. 1 n.) is untenable (cf.

The additional twelve ships would make the Aeginetan contingent (42) second to the Athenian, as Pausanias (ii. 29. 5) states, bringing it above the Corinthian squadron (40). Munro, however, prefers Cobet's a)llai i/ ne/es, partly on palaeographical grounds, partly because the special squadron in Aeschylus (Pers. 340) is one of ten ships. The addition of ten ships would make the Aeginetan contingent equal to the Corinthian, and H. may have inadvertently reckoned the two deserters (ch. 82. 2) twice over; cf. J. H. S. xxii. 322 a)po\\ *)epidau/rou: cf. v. 83 n. *oi)nw/nh is the name of the desert island to which Zeus carried the nymph Aegina (cf. v. 80 n.); there she bore Aeacus its first inhabitant (Paus. ii. 29). Pindar (Isth. vii. 21) in telling this story calls the island Oenopia, though elsewhere (Nem. iv. 46; v. 16; viii. 7) Oenona. Oenone seems to be connected with oi)=non, and may be, like Calliste (iv. 147), rather a descriptive epithet than an earlier name. a)po\\ *)aqhne/wn: cf. vii. 95. 1 n. For Democritus cf. six ships ascribed to the Naxians by Hellanicus and the five of Ephorus (Plut. l. c.) come from an imperfect recollection of this epigram. Plutarch makes H. speak of only three Naxian ships. Thucydides (vii. 57) is probably wrong in reckoning the men of Styra as Ionians, since Pausanias (iv. 34. 11) confirms H. Ceos, Cythnos, Seriphos, Siphnos, and Melos are the most western Cyclades nearest Greece. The Thesproti (cf. ii. 56; vii. 176. 4) occupied the coast of Epirus as far south as the gulf of Ambracia (Strabo 323). The river Acheron (cf. v. 92. h 2) flows through their land (Thuc. i. 46). *fa/u+llos: cf. Plut. Alex. 34 Phayllus as a noted runner of the olden time, and probably refers to the hero of the Persian wars, though if so the scholiast is wrong in calling him *)olumpioni/khs. The epigram (Anth. Pal. App. 297) ascribing to him a jump of 55 feet and a discus throw of 95 feet appears to be late, and is worthless as an authority (N. Gardiner, J. H. S. xxiv. 77-80). It is noticeable that but one trireme came from Greater Greece, and that furnished by a volunteer who had a special connexion with the mother country through his athletic victories. Melos was believed to have been colonized from Lacedaemon at the time of the Dorian invasion (Thuc. v. 84. 112) before 1100 B. C.; cf. the colonization of Thera, iv. 147 f.

Though the regular dating by archons is believed by many to go back to the institution of the annual archonship, 683 B. C., and almost certainly extends as far back as Solon, no trace of its use is found in the fragments of historians earlier than H. H. employs it here only, and Thucydides twice (v. 25, ii. lower town as opposed to the Acropolis, i. 14. 4, &c. tw=| i(rw=|. Here and elsewhere (cf. ch. 55 n.; v. 72. 3 n.) most naturally taken of a double temple of Athena and Erechtheus on the site of the later Erechtheum (D'Ooge, Acropolis, 43 f.; Frazer, Paus. vol. ii, Appendix). Since, however, no traces exist of any building there older than that erected during the Peloponnesian war (420-408 B. C.), D\u00f6rpfeld and his followers (including in this case E. A. Gardner, Ancient Athens, 76-83) interpret this of the old Hecatompedon; cf. v. 72. 3 n. tami/as tou= i(rou=. These officials had charge of the temple property, especially of the costly offerings and treasures kept in the temple. From 434 B. C. the lists of the treasures of Athena and inventories of the treasures in their charge are preserved on Inscriptions (Hicks, 49, 66, &c.). The treasurers (in H.'s days ten in number) were taken from the time of Solon from the richest class, Pentacosiomedemni (Ath. Pol. 7. 3, 8. 1; Gilbert, G. C. A. 241 n.). fraca/menoi. This barricade must have been at the western end where the Propylaea were later built; the other sides were protected by precipitous rocks and the old Pelasgic wall. Possibly the old gateways (cf. ta\\s pu/las, ch. 52. 2) of the Pelargicon or e)nnea/pulon (v. 64. 2 n.) still remained and were barricaded (D'Ooge, Acropolis, 27 f.). katanti/on: i. e. north-west and nearly opposite the principal entrance of the Acropolis which is on the west. The Amazons attacking Theseus are said to have seized this hill (Aesch. Eum. 688 f.). H.'s description of this way up as in front of the Acropolis but behind the gates has caused some confusion (e. g. Leake, Top. Athens, p. 264, thinks it implies that H. regarded the north side as the front). The entrance, however, to the subterranean passage (cf. inf.) faces west, the same direction as the main entrance (pu/lai), and is about seventy yards to the rear of it (o)/pisqe). Thus H.'s description is both accurate and obvious (E. Gardner, Ancient Athens, p. 47 ff.). a)ne/bhsan kata\\ to\\ i(ro/n. Pausanias (i. 18. 2) repeats this, adding the myth of Aglauros (Agraulos) and her sisters who opened the chest in which Erichthonius was hidden (cf. ch. 41. 2 n.) and then cast themselves down from the rocks above the precinct of Aglauros. 'It has generally been supposed that the escalading party either climbed up in the open, where they could hardly have escaped notice, or else ascended by the direct but narrow staircase that may still be seen above the grotto of Aglauros; but so obvious a way if not strongly barricaded, could hardly have been left unguarded. Recent excavations have shown a much more likely route. A natural cleft in the rock runs under or within the northern wall of the Acropolis; its western entrance is in the projecting face of rock just to the west of the cave of Aglauros; it has also an outlet at the eastern end, nearly opposite the west end of the Erechtheum. Where this cleft is within the wall of the Acropolis, it has an opening at the top which gives access to the plateau above it; but there is a sheer drop of about twenty feet, which might well lead the defenders to regard it as needing no guard; and an attacking party, once within the cleft, could ascend at their leisure with scaling ladders or ropes' (E. Gardner, l. c.). Bury (Cl. Rev. x. (1896) p. 416) argues that the defence of the Acropolis was undertaken by a regular garrison at the command of the Athenian generals. He lays stress on the length of the defence (suxno\\n xro/non, 52 ad fin.), reckoned by Busolt (ii. 695) at about a fortnight, on the desirability of satisfying both the rival interpretations of the wooden wall (c. 51 2; vii. 142), and above all on the consternation caused at Salamis by the capture of the Acropolis (ch. 56). Munro (J. H. S. xxii. 321) accepts this view, though he admits that a fortnight's siege is hard to reconcile with the movements of the Persian fleet (ch. 66, 70), and the regular occupation of the Acropolis inconsistent with the decree recorded in Plutarch p. 256 (Dind.). Moreover, the terror in the Greek fleet may be discounted as prevailing among the Peloponnesians always anxious to retreat to the Isthmus, and the suxno\\s xro/nos may only mean a long time under the circumstances (cf. Grundy, op. cit. 358, 359); so it seems better to accept H.'s account. Ctesias (\u00a7 26, p. 70), who otherwise agrees with H., makes the defenders escape by night, a suggestion uncritically accepted by Wecklein (Ber. Bayer. Akadem. (1876), p. me/garon cannot be distinguished from to\\ i(ro/n (ch. 51. 2 n., 55 n., and v. 72). Artabanus was regent during the king's absence (vii. 52 ad fin.). e)nqu/mion: whether he felt remorse for; cf. ii. 175. 5; Thuc. vii. 50. Possibly the real motive was a desire to conciliate the Attic exiles, his future subjects. Erechtheus the earthborn, though by genealogists made the son or grandson of Erichthonius, is really his double, the son of Earth and Hephaestus, and foster-child of Athene (cf. ch. 41. 2 n., 53. 1 n.). For the i(ero\\s lo/gos cf. Apollod. iii. 14. *)aqhnai/wn. Traditionally he is an ancient king of Athens (cf. 44. 2), founder of the worship of Athena, conqueror of Eumolpus of Eleusis, &c., but he is also identified with Poseidon. [For arguments against the identification cf. Farnell, G.C. iv. 47-54.] So a seat in the Dionysiac theatre (Block E. 1; C. I. A. iii. 276) belongs to the priest *poseidw=nos *gaiho/xou kai\\ *)erexqe/ws, cf. the altar of Poseidon in Erechtheum, 'on which they sacrifice also to Erechtheus' (Paus. i. 26. 5), and a dedication to Poseidon Erechtheus found there (C. I. A. i. 387). Butes, brother of Erechtheus and worshipped in his shrine (Paus. l. c.), is the son of Poseidon and Oreithyia, the daughter of Erechtheus, originally a sea-nymph (cf. vii. 189. 2 n.). e)lai/h. For the sacred olive as the life-tree of the state cf. Harrison, Cl. Rev. ix. 89, 90. As round the world-ash in the Edda twines the great snake Igdrasil, so the Attic serpent may have coiled round the sacred olive (Macan). The sacred olive (Paus. i. 27. 2 (cf. Frazer); Apollod. iii. 14. 2) stood in the Pandroseum just west of the Erechtheum proper (Philoch. ap. Dionys. Hal. de Dinarcho, 3; F. H. G. i. 409). qa/lassa: the well of sea-water which, when the south wind blew, gave forth the sound of breakers (Paus. l.c.), is believed to be the large cistern beneath the Erechtheum proper, i. e. the western division. H. certainly speaks as if both olive and sea were in an actual shrine of Erechtheus presumably ruined by the Persians, but the olive seems to have been outside the later Erechtheum, which was not begun till about 420 B. C.; cf. also v. 72. 3 n.; viii. 51. 2 n. The myth (cf. Apollod. iii. 14. 1) was that Poseidon came first, and, striking with his trident, created the salt well on the Acropolis (sup.), then Athena made the olive (sup.); cf. martu/ria qe/sqai (inf.); and the land was adjudged to Athena by the witness of Cecrops. The scene was represented on the west gable of the Parthenon (Gardner, op. cit., p. 293 f.; Collignon, S. G. ii. 34 f.) at the moment of Athena's triumph. There seems no earlier authority for the legend, which may be a reminiscence of a struggle between the worshippers of Poseidon and of Athene (cf. Farnell, op. cit. i. 270).

Invocation of of the Eleusinian procession. to\\ prokei/menon. The matter laid before the council of war, i.e. the place where they should fight (cf. inf. and ch. 49). Since the same council appears to have received the news that Xerxes had entered Attica (ch. 50), and also that he had taken the Acropolis, though the siege took some time (52 ad fin.). H. must have merged into one two councils of war (cf. Appendix XXI, \u00a7 1). The proposal to leave Salamis and retire to the Isthmus attributed to the first council (ch. 49) is far more probable after the fall of the Acropolis, but the panic of the Greeks is as usual exaggerated. In the suggestions that the absolute necessity of fighting at Salamis was seen first by Mnesiphilus, and that Themistocles adopted his plan without acknowledgment (ch. 58. 2), we may see the prejudice of H.'s Attic informants (cf. ch. 4. 2 n.; Introd. \u00a7 31). We may set against the story Themistocles' reputation for matchless wisdom immediately after Salamis (ch. 124), and his dedication after the battle of a shrine to Artemis Aristoboule (Plut. Them. 22; de Mal. Herod. 37), and above all Thucydides' insistence on his whether statesmanship was innate or acquired became a favourite topic in philosophic circles (Xen. Mem. iv. 2. 2; Symp. viii. 39; Plat. Men. 93 B, 99 B), and Themistocles was a leading instance (Bauer, Them. p. 72). We may see the result of this in Plutarch, who by silence (Them.) or explicitly (de Mal. l.c.) rejects the intervention of Mnesiphilus on this occasion, and yet retains him as the pupil of Solon and teacher of Themistocles in politics (Them. 2; Moral. 154, 795 C). The anecdote here is surely apocryphal (cf. Busolt, ii. 641 n.; Meyer, iii. \u00a7 223 n.). All the later (Plut. Them. 11; Aelian, V. H. 258, Dind.) except Pseud. Plut. Mor. 185 B represent the scene as taking place between Eurybiades and Themistocles, thus unduly emphasizing the rivalry between Sparta and Athens and obscuring the hostility of Corinth. They add more picturesque detail, the signal,' and 'those left at the post'. Themistocles should have waited till the president called on him. r(api/zontai are beaten by the r(abdou=xoi (constables) at the orders of the stewards (a)gwnoqe/tai). Thus Lichas was beaten for a breach of the rules at Olympia (Paus. vi. 2. 2; Thuc. v. 50; Xen. Hell. iii. 2. 21). *)en soi/. This recalls the address of Miltiades to Callimachus (vi. 109. 3). a)nazeu/gch|s: in Attic intransitive, in H. (cf. ix. 41. 2, 58. 3) transitive. Here an expression proper only for an army and its baggage train is transferred to a fleet. barute/ras, 'of heavier build,' is quite suitable to the argument here, and should not be emended (as by Stein) to bradute/ras in deference to Plutarch's description of the Greek ships as lower and lighter, and the barbarian as heavy and unwieldy, with lofty decks and poops (Them. 14). This description is not borne out by anything in H. (cf. viii. 10. 1) and may have been taken from some later battle, e.g. Actium. In the open sea the enemy could surround the weaker Greek fleet (ch. 16), in the narrows their very numbers would be against them as well as their ignorance of the fairway. The Greek ships were inferior to the enemy in manuvring (ch. 10. 1). Only the great superiority in this acquired by the Athenians between 480 and 430 B. C. (cf. Thuc. i. 49) justified the opposite tactics of Phormio (Thuc. ii. 90). Without a fleet Xerxes would be driven to retreat by lack of supplies, as well as by the fear that he might be cut off from his kingdom. lo/gion: cf. vii. 141. 4. H., after a clear statement of the arguments for fighting at Salamis, makes Themistocles end with a piece of proverbial wisdom similar to that ascribed to Artabanus, vii. 10. d 2. e)piyhfi/zein a)po/li a)ndri/ means 'to take a vote on the motion of a man without a city' (cf. Thuc. vi. 14), the point being that Themistocles, no longer representing a city, has no right to make a motion (sententiam dicere). For gnw/mas sumba/llesqai cf. v. 92. a 2. Siris, fabled to be of Trojan origin (Strabo 264), was on the river of the same name half-way between Sybaris and Tarentum. Apparently it was colonized from Colophon and imitated Sybaris in wealth and luxury (Athen. 523). Probably it also resembled Sybaris in the possession of an overland trade, since we find alliance coins with the names of Siris and Pyxus on them (Hill, G. and R. C., p. 104). It is said to have been conquered by its Achaean neighbours, Sybaris, Croton, and Metapontum (before 510 B. C., Justin xx. 2; cf. Pais, Ancient Italy, pp. 67-86). Later, after 440, Siris was refounded by Thurii and Tarentum jointly, though accounted a Tarentine colony. Finally, 433-431 B. C., most of its inhabitants removed to Heraclea, Siris remaining the port of that colony. h(mete/rh e)k palaiou=. The claims of Athens to Siris seem shadowy, resting only on her headship of the Ionic race. But that the idea of westward expansion, afterwards so popular at Athens, had occurred to Themistocles is suggested by the names of his daughters Italia and Sybaris (Plut. Them. 32), by his supposed relations with Hiero (Plut. Them. 24, 25), if they be not fictions of Stesimbrotus and Theophrastus (Schaefer, Philol. xviii. 187), his interest in Corcyra (Plut. Them. 24; Thuc. i. 136). It is, however, possible that Themistocles, following the oracle, only threatened westward emigration vaguely, and that the precise spot was fixed on later, when Athenian interest had become centred on New Sybaris (450 B. C.) and Thurii (445 B. C.). At that time there would be many old oracles, real or spurious, encouraging colonization there. The idea of emigration en masse had been mooted more than once in Ionia (i. 170), but would have been hard to carry out in this case. a)krobolisa/menoi: a metaphor from 'skirmishing', as lo/gwn w)qismo/s (78) from hand-to-hand fighting. For this summons to the Aeacidae cf. v. 80. The idea clearly is that the coming of the image would ensure also the spiritual presence and aid of the heroes; cf. the coming of the ark to the camp of Israel (1 Sam. iv. 3). Apparently only Aeacus and Phocus were regarded in legend as inhabitants of Aegina, and possibly the images are of these two heroes, but their descendants in Thessaly (Peleus, &c.) and Phocis (Paus. ii. 29. 2) would have a share in their honours. The Eleusinian plain lies south-west of Mount Parnes, being divided from the Attic plain by Mount Poikilon and Daphni, and bounded on the north and west by Cithaeron and the highlands of Megara. It is called Thriasian (ix. 7. b 2; Thuc. i. 114, ii. 19-21) from the important deme of Thria, which lay probably at Kalyvia, three miles east-north-east of Eleusis. The regular route from Thebes, by which the Persian infantry would naturally come, led to the Thriasian plain a little north of Eleusis. Plutarch (Them. 15) puts this vision on the day of the battle, which would thus be on the 20th Boedromion (Plut. Phocion 28, Camill. 19). It is, however, evident that Plutarch derived all the details of his account, except 'a great light that shone from Eleusis', from H., and that the historian believed that Dicaeus saw the portent at least a day, and perhaps several days, before the battle. Busolt (ii. 703-4) argues that the battle took place a few days after the 20th Boedromion (= Sept. 22) and some days before the eclipse (Oct. 2, 480), which prevented Cleombrotus from molesting the retreat of Xerxes (ix. 10), probably Sept. 27 or 28. trismuri/wn. The number is the conventional estimate for the Athenian citizen-body in the days of H. (v. 97. 2 n.), since citizens were expected to accompany the procession en masse (Plut. Alc. 34). The old temple or hall of initiation destroyed by the Persians was, as is shown by excavations, only about 82 feet square, and could not hold any such number; indeed, even the larger hall begun by Pericles (about 170 feet square) only seems to have provided seats for some 3,000 on the eight tiers of steps round it (Frazer, Paus. ii. 503). Of course, many Athenians were not initiated. The poetical words, a)dah/mona, si/nos, a)ri/dhla, may be derived from the source used by H. They clearly suit the tone of the story. The great procession from Athens to Eleusis along the sacred way took place on the 20th Boedromion (Eur. Ion 1076, cf. sup.). It bore the name Iacchus because in it the statue of the child Iacchus, with his cradle and playthings, was borne, escorted by Ephebi and followed by the Mystae bearing torches and singing hymns (Arist. Ran. 398-413). Frequent sacrifices and ceremonies on the road made the procession last from daybreak till late at night. All through the day there was constant invocation of the god (*)/iagx' w)= *)/iagxe, Arist. l. c.). For the worship Kore at Eleusis cf. Farnell, Greek Harrison, ch. ad fin., ch. x ad fin. *di/kaios o( *qeoku/deos. This isolated anecdote was surely preserved by oral tradition. It gives no support to P. Trautwein's hypothesis that Dicaeus left memoirs from which H. drew freely (Hermes, xxv. 527-66). Persian fleet at Phalerum. Council of War. Decision to fight against Artemisia's advice. This resumes the diary of the Persian fleet, broken off in ch. 25, and takes it from Aphetae to Phalerum in nine days, six given here, one spent in going from Aphetae to Histiaea (ch. 23), one at Thermopylae, and one in returning to Histiaea (ch. 25) (Macan). The reinforcements which reached the land army, which H. (ix. 32. 2) estimates at 50,000, may well have balanced the losses. Accordingly Tarn (J. H. S. xxviii. 204 n.) would save H.'s credit by taking him to refer not to ships or crews, but solely to fighting men, including marines. For the fleet the idea of compensation is absurd. H. has reckoned the loss from storms (vii. 190; viii. 13) at 600 ships, besides mentioning losses in battle amounting to perhaps a hundred more (vii. 194; viii. 11, 14, 16), thus reducing his grand total of 1,327 (cf. vii. 89. 1, 184. 1, 185. 1) to some 600 (cf. Diod. xi. 19, 27). He then found himself confronted with Aeschylus' computation of the fleet at Salamis (1,207; Pers. 341), which he had used earlier (vii. 89. 1) and reverted to it, setting against the enormous losses (cf. sup. and especially ch. 13 ad fin.) the scanty contingents of a few islands of doubtful loyalty (\u00a7 2; cf. vii. 95). kai\\ ma/la, 'and further'; cf. i. 134. 3.

The word implies an artificially constructed way (cf. vii. 115. 3), but there was no carriage road till Hadrian made one, of which some traces remain (Paus. i. 44. 6), though according to Megarian legend, Sciron made a footpath for travellers. Now there is a highway and railroad, but fifty years ago the path still deserved its modern name, Kake Scala. It was indeed the shortest of the three ways across Geranea into the Peloponnese, but 'for six miles it ran along a narrow crumbling ledge half-way up the face of an almost sheer cliff at a height of six to seven hundred feet above the sea. . . . Nothing was easier than to make such a path impassable' (cf. Frazer, Diod. xi. 16). This wall, from the materials and haste with which it was built, would seem to have been a temporary field-work. Neither Thucydides nor Xenophon alludes to any such impediment to the march of troops across the Isthmus. In 369 B. C. (Diod. xv. 68) an ineffectual attempt was made to bar the Isthmus against Epaminondas by making a palisade and trench from Cenchreae to Lechaeum. A wall seems to have protected the Peloponnese against the Gallic invasion, 279 B. C. (Paus. vii. 6. 7), and more certainly in the days of Valerian (253 A. D.) there was a wall, repaired later by Justinian, and last used by the Venetians in 1463 and 1696. It may still be traced from sea to sea running along a line of low cliffs, a little south of the modern canal, and is best preserved near the Isthmian sanctuary; cf. Frazer, Paus. iii. 5-6. h)/neto: the work does not seem to have been finished till the following summer; cf. ix. 7.

The old Asine was on the coast (Paus. ii. 36. 4) near Nauplia (Strabo 373), probably at Tolon, five miles south-east of Nauplia. It was destroyed by the Dorian Argives during the first Messenian war, and its Dryopian inhabitants taking refuge with the Spartans were given a new home in the conquered Messenian land on the west coast of the Coronaean Gulf near its southern headland Acritas (cf. Paus. iv. 14. 3, 34. 6 f.). This is the city here meant, Cardamyle lying just across the gulf on the Laconian coast. *parwreh=tai: in Triphylia (cf. iv. 148. 4 n.); they were Minyan immigrants from Lemnos (iv. 145 f.). The meaning seems to be: 'The Cynurians being autochthonous, appear to be Ionians, and the only ones left in the Peloponnese' (the Aegialians having been driven out). Pausanias from the preDorian inhabitants of Argos. It is probable that they belong to the aboriginal population, but there seems no special reason for holding them to be Ionic. H. here as elsewhere (cf. i. 56) makes Ionians a branch of Pelasgi. Apparently the town Orneae (about thirteen miles north-west of Argos) was reduced by Argos to a status similar to that of the Laconian Perioecic towns under Sparta. Hence all the other Perioeci of Argos were termed Orneatae; cf. the Caerites at Rome. Stein holds that kai\\ peri/oikoi is an adscript, on the grounds that Cynuria had belonged to Sparta at least since about 550 B. C. (i. 82; Thuc. v. 41), and that the Argive Perioeci, some of whom are said to have been enfranchised (Ar. Pol. 1303 a 8), and who were all, including the Orneatae (Thuc. v. 67), treated as su/mmaxoi (Thuc. v. 47, 77), had been united with Argos (Paus. viii. 27. 1).

Losses at Thermopylae and elsewhere (vii. 222; ix. 30) had so much diminished the number of Thespians that the city was glad to welcome immigrants (e)poi/kous). That Sicinnus was a Greek is stated by Aeschylus (Pers. 355) and supported by his enfranchisement. Plutarch (Them. 12) must be wrong in calling him a Persian, though he may have been an Asiatic Greek (Grote). Aeschylus (Pers. 353 f.) rightly attributes the king's resolution to advance on Salamis to this message. On its purport and on the differences between Aeschylus and Herodotus cf. App. XXI. 3. On the occupation of Psyttaleia and the other movements cf. Appendix XXI. 4 f. *ke/on kai\\ *kuno/souran. These names cause a difficulty. They seem to be taken from the oracle of Bacis (ch. 77). That oracle may well have had reference originally not to Salamis but to Artemisium; if so, Ceos would be the well-known island, Cynosura the promontory near Marathon, and the temple of Artemis that at Brauron (cf. Munro, J. H. S. xxii. 306 n.). Afterwards the prophecy was applied to Salamis and the temple of Artemis identified with that at Munychia. Blakesley, following Larcher, believes that H. intends to describe the closing up of Persian squadrons from these distant points, but the nearest of them, Ceos, is forty miles off Salamis, while Cynosura is sixty miles away, so that the supposed movement is impossible. It seems probable that Cynosura (dog's tail) really was the name of the long tongue of land reaching out from Salamis towards Psyttaleia, and that Ceos and Munychia are mentioned because the prophecy must be fulfilled. Stein and Hauvette believe Ceos to be identical with Cynosura, the former, as the regular name, coming first and explaining the obsolete synonym; for this use of te kai/ cf. ch. 43, 73. 3. Beloch's (Klio viii. 477) suggestion that Ceos is the old name of Lipso Kutali (Psyttaleia) and his attempt to find the true Psyttaleia in the isle of St. George are not acceptable (Appendix XXI. 5 n.). (See note, p. 416.) Aeschylus implies that the Persians sent a squadron round the island to enclose the Greeks. It must have been these detached ships from which Aristides had to flee (79, 81), yet they are never clearly mentioned in H. Psyttaleia, said by Aeschylus to have been occupied by the flower of the Persian host, is described Pers. argument drawn from this as to the site of the battle cf. Appendix XXI. 4, 5. ou)de\\n a)pokoimhqe/ntes, 'without having refreshed themselves with sleep'; cf. Aesch. Pers. 383. This is perhaps the strongest profession of faith in oracles to be found in H., often as he delights to notice the fulfilment of prophecy (cf. ch. 20. 1 n., 96; ix. 43). His faith is in marked contrast with the scepticism of Thucydides (ii. 17, 54; v. 26). Probably the ordinary Athenian leaned to the side of faith. During the Peloponnesian war, oracles attributed to ancient seers, above all to Bacis (ch. 20. 1 n.), were widely current at Athens (Thuc. ii. 8, 21). The keenness of the conflict between superstition and scepticism is shown by the frequent parodies of oracles in Aristophanes (Eq. 120 f., The beginning a)ll' o(/tan common in oracles (i. 55. 2; iii. 57. 4; vi. 77. 2), and was therefore (with the variation a)ll' o(/potan) affected by the golden sword' (Il. v. 509; xv. 256) transferred to his sister. i(ero\\n a)kth/n: in Hesiod, *)/erga 597, 805 = the holy corn of Demeter, here 'the hallowed shore'. gefurw/swsi. The great Persian fleet might seem to stretch like a bridge across the straits, either (1) at Salamis, which H. plainly understands the oracle to mean, there being temples of Artemis both at Salamis itself (Paus. i. 36. 1) and at Munychia on the Attic shore (Paus. i. 1. 4); or (2) if the oracle referred to the fighting off Euboea, (a) at Artemisium (vii. 176), or (b) between Euboea and Attica, or finally across the bay of Marathon from Cynosura to Halae Araphenides and Brauron, the sites of to Artemis (Eur. Iph. Taur. 1450 f.; Strabo 399). But the oracle is best regarded as a vaticinium post eventum of Salamis. *(/ubrios ui(o/n: and a)napi/esqai, 'swallow up,' rare and late.

The narrative of H. suggests, though it does not assert, that this was the first return of Aristides to his country after his ostracism, which took place at the time of Themistocles' increase of the fleet (Ath. Pol. 22) in 483-482, or a little before (484-483, Jerome, Eusebius). But it appears that the general return of exiles must be placed in the archonship of Hypsichides, i. e. before June 480 (Ath. Pol. 22), though Plutarch (Arist. 8) makes it synchronize with Xerxes' march through Thessaly and Boeotia (July-August). Again, Xanthippus, who had also been ostracized, returned before the evacuation of Attica (Plut. Cato maj. 5; Philoch, fr. 84, F. H. G. i. 397). Finally, in the capture of Psyttaleia, Aristides acts as general in command of a large force of Attic hoplites, i. e. appears to be one of the strategi (ch. 95 n.). If so, he must have been sent to Aegina on some mission, perhaps to take Athenian refugees thither (Grundy, p. 390), or to fetch the Aeacidae thence (Bury, Cl. Rev. x. 414 f.). The objection that while Aristides reached Salamis overnight, the trireme with the Aeacidae is not reported to have arrived till next morning (viii. 83), is parried by Burrows' remark (Cl. Rev. xi. 258) that Aristides did not arrive till after midnight (viii. 76, 81), so that the sailors would have already turned in, and so would not welcome the Aeacidae till daybreak. Nor is it easy to see how any ship could have evaded the Persian blockade after Aristides. The objections remain that the trireme which fetched the Aeacidae must surely have been Aeginetan (viii. 64, 83, 84), and that, had Aristides been commissioned to escort the Aeacidae, H. would have known and mentioned so interesting a fact. With this character of Aristides cf. Plut. Arist. 3, where the people in the theatre apply to him the line of Aeschylus about 46. 1), but 'standing at the doors of', since he calls Themistocles out (cf. e)ch=lqe, \u00a7 2). Probably only the commander-in-chief of Athens, Themistocles (vii. 173. 2; viii. 4, 19, 61), would have the right to attend the council. au)to/pths. The new fact hitherto unknown to which Aristides can bear witness, is the complete envelopment of the Greeks by the Persian squadron sent round Salamis, blocking retreat to the west (cf. Appendix XXI. 5). The advance of the main body to block the eastern straits could hardly have escaped notice. e)kplw=sai implies that Aristides had a difficulty in putting out from Aegina, hence diekplw=sai (cf. Plut. 17) speaks of a Samian sent by the Ionians, and Plutarch, or his copyist (Them. 12), of a Tenedian ship, but Tenos duly appears on the snake supporting the tripod dedicated at Delphi (ix. 81 n.) as well as on the base of the statue of Zeus at Olympia (Paus. v. 23).

App. XXI. 7). *pallhneu/s (cf. 93. 1): from the well-known deme Pallene (i. 62. 3). According to Plutarch (Them. 14) he was of Decelea, and according to Diodorus (xi. 27; cf. Ael. V. H. v. 19, and vit. Aesch.), he was a brother of Aeschylus, but since the poet was thought to be of Eleusis (vit. Aesch.; schol. Ar. Ran. 886), this is perhaps a confusion. If Aeschylus is relating his brother's exploits, the simplicity of Pers. 408 f. has a double charm. He probably believed the Athenians began the battle, since the Phoenician ships were arrayed against them (85. 1; Pers. 410). If the Aeginetans were on the other wing of the Greek fleet (Diod. xi. 18), each city might be honestly convinced that their champions had begun the battle. Very possibly the Aeginetans, who won the prize for valour, were right in their claim, yet the mention of the trireme bearing the Aeacidae looks like the invention of a happy omen. e(spe/rhs. The true points of the compass are north-west and south-east; cf. vii. 36. 2, 176. 3. H. is probably under the misapprehension that the two fleets were ranged along the sides of the straits, but the true explanation would seem to be that each fleet pushed forward its right wing (Aesch. Pers. 399, 409, and App. XXI. 7; Grundy, p. 397), which could be supported by troops posted on the shore behind it. The Athenians, as at Plataea, had the left wing, the post second in honour (ix. 26 f.), the Lacedaemonians the post of honour on the extreme right. Diodorus (xi. 18) wrongly stations the Lacedaemonians with the Athenians, and puts the Megarians and Aeginetans on the right. He agrees in putting the Phoenicians on the right and the Ionians on the left of the Persian line (xi. 17), adding that the Cyprians, Cilicians, Pamphylians, and Lycians were between them arranged in that order (xi. 19). This geographical order may be taken from the list of ships in vii. 90-2. ta\\s e)ntola/s: cf. ch. 22. The exception is due to the author's peculiar interest in Samos. Theomestor must have received his reward at once and enjoyed it less than a year, since Samos was freed again in 479; cf. ix. 90 f. Enrolment as a benefactor was an honour not uncommonly paid to foreigners by Greek states (cf. 136. 1 n.). It was also a regular Persian custom (cf. ch. 90. 4; iii. 140, 154, 160; vi. 30), as is proved by the book of Esther (vi. 1 f.; cf. ii. 23), the inscription of Gadatas swmatofu/lakes from old 'to guard' and khsh\u00e2yata, 'king,' but Nymphis (fr. 12; F. iii. ce/noi basi/leioi. Rawlinson suggests khur sangha (Zend), 'worthy of praise or record.' H., but for this short chapter on the general disorder and a sentence or two in ch. 89, gives us no description of the movements in the battle, such as we get at Mycale, as well as at Marathon and Plataea. In his account the fighting resolves itself into a series of individual exploits without connected plan. The general picture in Aesch. Pers. 412 f. is 25. 5) seems to mean 'they proved themselves better men than when off Euboea, and, indeed, surpassed themselves'. sunh/neike, 'which turned out to her advantage'; cf. ix. 37. 4.

But such co-operation would have been difficult, and must surely have been more distinctly mentioned. Probably the Aeginetans, belonging to the advanced right wing (cf. App. XXI. 8), worked round the left flank of the Persian fleet. Grundy (p. 400), however, believes that they were stationed next to the Athenians, and thus, since the Phoenicians got in advance of the rest of the Persian line, were able to take them in flank, while the Athenians attacked them in front. th\\n e)pi\\ *skia/qw|: cf. vii. 179 f., and for Pytheas vii. 181.

These words repeat, after the interruption, the conclusion of ch. 92. That this Athenian story was a late and malicious invention is hinted by H. himself in the words (\u00a7 4) marture/ei de/ e)/xei is itself a note of uncertainty; cf. vii. 3. 2; ix. 84. 2. There is no trace of any such charge elsewhere, and immediately after the battle the Athenians allowed the following epitaph to be placed on the tomb of the Corinthians buried at Salamis (Hicks, 18; cf. couplet given by Plutarch (of which there is no trace on the stone) is a later addition, as shown by the no reason to suspect the epitaphs taken by Plutarch (l. c.), cf. Dio Chrys. xxxvii, p. 459, from the cenotaph erected to the Corinthians at the Isthmus and from grave that Adimantus, here as elsewhere (cf. viii. 5. 59), suffers for the sins of his son Aristeus, one of the most active enemies of Athens at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war (cf. vii. 137. 3; Thuc. i. 60, 65, ii. 67). We should not, with Plutarch (l. c.), ascribe such tales to the malignity of H. but to the bitter feelings of his Athenian informants (cf. Introduction, p. 39). For the real mission of the Corinthians cf. App. XXI. 8. ta\\ i(sti/a a)eira/menon: hoisting sail was a proof of flight (cf. vi. 14. 2; viii. 56), since in battle the trireme took down mast and sail and used only oars.

Solon 9), and would thus interpret Plutarch's Mor. 870 B) ta\\ lh/gonta th=s *salamini/as, 'the end of the land of Salamis,' but this phrase may better be applied to the territory of the town Salamis, and the temple placed two miles north of the town on Cape Arapis, near the modern arsenal and the isle of Leros (cf. Appendix XXI. 8). Aeschylus distinctly put this exploit after the defeat of the Persian fleet, when the Greeks can surround the island with their ships and land from them (Pers. 455 f.). H. seems to date it at the time of the Persian rout (e)n tw=| qoru/bw| tou/tw|, cf. ch. 91). Plutarch mistakenly makes Aristides land from boats with some picked volunteers at the beginning of the sea-fight, and adds other untrustworthy details from Phanias (Them. 13; Arist. 9). Bury argues forcibly that Aristides, being given so important a duty, must have been a Strategus (ch. 79 n.). e)/ti e)o/nta: many had been carried over to the Attic shore still held by the enemy (cf. \u00a7 2). Cape Colias is wrongly placed by Strabo (398) near Anaphlystus. Since Pausanias (i. 1. 5) makes it twenty stades from Phalerum, it is probably Cape Cosmas (Kiepert, xiv. 6), a narrow tongue of land with shelving beach, not Trispyrgi (Leake; Milch\u00f6fer), a rocky headland only 600 yards from the probable site of Phalerum. Vessels would be thrown on this part of the coast by such a wind as appears from H. and Plutarch (Them. 14) to have blown on the day of Salamis. But no doubt the particular spot is named to bring out the fulfilment of the oracles, the completeness of which H. emphasizes the words a)poplhsqh=nai . . . n. e)lelh/qee, 'whose meaning had escaped all the Greeks before the battle of Salamis.' fru/cousi, 'the Coliad women shall roast a distinctive token of the housewife. Xerxes meditates flight. Account of the Persian post and of the reception at Susa of the news of defeat. H. gives no details of the losses on either side, Ctesias (Pers. 26) gives the Persian loss in ships as 500, Diodorus (xi. 19, Ephorus) says 40 Greek ships were destroyed and over 200 Persian besides those captured. Ctesias (Pers. 26) and Strabo (395) make Xerxes begin the mole before the battle. But it is unlikely that he would engage in a lengthy and laborious operation of such doubtful utility, while he had confidence in the superiority of his fleet. Again, after the loss of the battle and the retreat of his fleet, he could not hope to carry through the undertaking. Alexander, indeed, succeeded at Tyre (Arr. Anab. ii. 18), though only after defeating the Tyrian fleet, but there the channel was less than half a mile in width and three fathom deep, whereas at Salamis, even at the narrowest point by the Heracleum (Ctesias, l. c.), it is nearly a mile broad and four fathom at least in depth. H. is therefore justified in regarding it as a mere pretence to mask the retreat, unless indeed the whole story is a mistaken inference from some preparations for making a wharf or pier, or, again, an invention on the analogy of Xerxes' other violations of nature (Isocr. Paneg. 89; Juv. x. 174 f.), the Hellespont (J. H. S. xxii. 332). Xenophon (Cyrop. viii. 6. 18), too, says the Persian post is the quickest travelling accomplished by man on land. We may compare 'The prairie post or pony express' in Mark Twain's 'Roughing (Macan), and, better, the description of the Great Khan's post (Marco Polo, bk. ii, ch. 26; Yule, i. 433 f.): 'These men travel a good 200 or 250 miles in the day . . . the despatch speeds along from post to post always at full gallop with a regular change of horses.' lampadhfori/h. Torch races were held at the Panathenaea, and the festivals of Prometheus, Hephaestus, Pan (vi. 105. 3), Bendis (Plato, Rep. i. 328 A), Hermes, and Theseus. They appear to have been of two kinds. In the simpler, a number of runners each with a lighted torch started abreast, and the one who first carried his torch alight to the goal won (Paus. i. 30. 2). The other was a relay or team race. There were several lines of runners; the first man in each line had his torch lighted at the altar and ran with it at full speed to the second, to whom he passed it on, the second to the third, and so on till the last man carried it to the goal. The line of runners which first passed its torch alight to the goal was the winning team. Cf. Lucr. ii. 79; Aesch. Ag. 312 f.; and of the also Laws 776 B). The torch race arose from the custom of transmitting a new and sacred fire from the altar to hearths polluted by death or the enemy's presence (Plut. Arist. 20). In such cases the old fire was extinguished and new pure fire carried as quickly as possible by runners to the hearths awaiting it (cf. Frazer, Paus. ii. 392). a)/ggaros, 'post-rider,' is a Babylonian loan-word (Meyer, iii, \u00a7 39 n.), the pure Persian being a)sta/ndhs. It is 6. 17. For this post cf. also Esther viii. 10, iii. 13. For the offerings cf. vii. 54. 1 n., and for the first message viii. 54.

Perhaps the preposition adds the idea of hitting the mark. e)s *)/efeson: the starting-point of the great road by Sardis to Susa; cf. v. 52 f., especially 54, 55. Stein and Duncker (vii. 291) argue that the entrusting by Xerxes of his sons to Artemisia and Hermotimus shows that he had not determined to retreat, and consequently that the consultation of Artemisia is a fable. The suggestion is plausible but not convincing, since there are many reasons why Xerxes might prefer to send his sons by sea and go himself by land. no/qoi: sons of concubines.

This notice of Pedasa (cf. v. 121 n.) is a repetition of one already given (i. 175), and was probably originally added in the margin by some reader who remembered the earlier chapter, and thence crept into the text.

Ephesus and Sardis were the starting-points of the Royal Road to Susa (v. 52 f.). Also at Sardis there was a temple of Cybele (v. 102), 'the great mother,' served by eunuch priests called 'Galli' (Juv. viii. 176; Mayor), and at Ephesus the eunuch-priests Megabyzi, were held in honour (Strabo 641). th=s pa/shs, 'in every respect.' This view of the fidelity of eunuchs is ascribed by Xenophon (Cyrop. vii. 560 f.) to Cyrus, while Ctesias (Pers. 5 and 9) makes Pesitacas and Bagapates have influence with Cyrus, Ixabates and Aspadates with Cambyses, &c., but the preponderant influence of the eunuch and the harem in Persia seems really to begin with the reign of Xerxes (cf. ix. 108). For their extensive use and functions at court cf. iii. 77, 92, 130, and i. 117. The custom is said to have been derived from Babylon (cf. iii. 92 and Hellan. fr. 169, F. H.

Macan thinks the Greek fleet cannot have sailed to Andros, leaving Salamis unprotected, while Xerxes was still in Attica, nor have attacked the islands without an express resolution of the council passed at Salamis, but a reconnaissance to Andros by the main fleet, while a few ships guarded Salamis, is not improbable, and the decision of the council is taken there according to H. *eu)rubia/dhs. Macan doubts whether Eurybiades should figure as the opponent of Themistocles in this debate, but the substitution of Aristides (Plut. Them. 16; Arist. 9) reads like a later fiction devised by some one anxious to add another occasion for their constant differences; and the transfer of the conversation to Salamis seems almost accidental. For the scourging of the sea cf. vii. 35 n. The burning of temples is proved by the instances adduced (v. 102. 1 n.) and by the ruins of temples never restored seen by Pausanias (x. 35. 2 f., with Frazer).

Themistocles seems to assume that the Persians will at least retreat from Attica. a)poqh/khn poih/sesqai. In Thuc. i. the story of Themistocles' banishment and flight to Persia see Thuc. i. 135-8. He was probably ostracized 471-470, and fled to Persia five years later (Meyer, iii, \u00a7 286 n.). H. is evidently here under the influence of traditions hostile to Themistocles. There is no special reason to suspect him of double dealing in this case; he may quite well have been honestly in favour of breaking down the bridge and stirring up revolt among the Greeks of Asia, and yet have resolved to sacrifice the project rather than make a breach in the alliance with the Peloponnesians. It is, however, hard to believe that he seriously contemplated sending the fleet to the Hellespont while the Persian army was still in Attica. Possibly he proposed the plan when Xerxes had begun his retreat; cf. further \u00a7 2 n. With this character of Themistocles cf. Thuc. Arist. 9) and Polyaenus (i. 30. 4) substitutes a captive eunuch, Arnaces. Thucydides (i. 137; cf. 109. 5 n.) speaks of this second message as sent from Salamis. A. Bauer (Them. pp. 22, 49) and Wecklein (Ber. der bayer. Akad. (1876) p. 296; with whom Meyer, iii, \u00a7 226 n., seems disposed to agree) regard this second message as an invention of the enemies of Themistocles, designed to cloud the glory of the first. But Thucydides (l. c.), rightly construed, implies that some message warning Xerxes to retreat was sent. It may have been, however, as Duncker (vii. 295 f.), following Ephorus ruse to hasten the departure of Xerxes, although in his letter (ap. Thuc. i. 137) Themistocles later claimed it was a benefit conferred on the king. It is certainly odd that Xerxes should again accept advice from Themistocles when Sicinnus' first message had had such disastrous results. nhsiwte/wn: cf. vii. 95. 1. xrh/mata: clearly the fleet exacted war indemnities from islands that had supported the enemy (cf. 66. 2). These would be used for the pay and provisions of the crews. Such a)rgurologi/a was a common practice in the Peloponnesian war (Thuc. ii. 69; iii. 19; iv. 50, 75, &c.). H. unfairly (cf. ch. 4. 2 n.) represents the whole matter as if it had to do with the private gain of Themistocles (ch. 112). No doubt some money may have stuck to the fingers of the most influential leader (Timocreon, fr. 1), but these exactions were in the main public. e)s ta\\s a)/llas: with the exception, of course, of the loyal states (cf. ch. 46). u(perbolh/: here and Polyb. xiv. 9. 8, 'delay' u(perba/llesqai.

Considerations of transport and supply must have made it necessary for Mardonius to retire to Thessaly for winter quarters, and it was now October (a)nwri/h). Only Artabazus' corps really escorted the king on his homeward way (ch. 126). For the force retained by Mardonius cf.

The Greeks were convinced that Xerxes started homewards with the greater part of his Aesch. Pers. 803plh=qos e)/kkriton and a mere handful of men; hence multitudes must have perished by the way. But in all probability Xerxes left Mardonius the bulk of the land force; otherwise what need was there for Artabazus with a corps from Mardonius' army to escort him (ch. 126?). And that corps, whose original strength was 60,000 (ch. 126), is estimated, even after its heavy losses in the winter campaign (ch. 127 f.), as 40,000 strong (ix. 66. 2). It would seem then that, even in Herodotus, the losses and sufferings of the retreat have been much exaggerated. Yet more incredible are the horrors in Aeschylus, the losses from hunger and thirst in Thessaly, where Mardonius wintered, and the disaster through the melting of the ice on the Strymon (Pers. 495 f.); cf. Grote iv. 489 f. From the first the contrast between the proud advance and the miserable retreat of Xerxes struck the Greek imagination, and the contrast got more and more exaggerated as time went on. Cf. Justin ii. 13 'ipse may see from the scarcity of details, as well as from the suspicious character of some of those given, both in H. and Aeschylus, how slight was the knowledge the Greeks had of the retreat of Xerxes, as compared with the full account of his advance (vii. 61 n.).

The Bisaltae lived above Argilus (vii. 115. 1), and the Crestonian land reached as far as the sources of the Echeidorus (vii. 124, 127. 2, and v. 3. 2 n.), but it may have touched Bisaltia at its other end and have been subject to the Bisaltian prince. e)ntetame/nas: cf. vii. 34 n.

The third star here may have represented (Preller, Gr. Myth. i3. 207; ii3. 106) Apollo Delphinios, also a saviour from storms at sea much worshipped at Aegina.

The proposals of Alexander as envoy of Mardonius (ch. 136) and the Spartan reply would give occasion for dragging in Themistocles' relations with Sparta. Diodorus declares (xi. 27) that the Athenians were so angry with Themistocles for accepting gifts from the Spartans that they deprived him of his command and gave it to Xanthippus, but the statement is only an inference drawn by Ephorus from the facts in H. *belbini/ths. Belbina is a rocky islet about ten miles south of Sunium at the entrance of the Saronic gulf, now St. George. It remained a separate community (Scylax, 52), paying tribute as late as 425 B.C. (C. I. A. i. 37; Hicks, 64). It is here a mere example of an utterly unimportant place (Teles Athenian (\u00a7 2) of Aphidna (\u00a7 1), and the saying meaning, 'I should not have received this honour had I been of Belbina, nor will you though you are (like me) an Athenian.'

H. is so fully informed about his movements and views (ix. 41 f., 66, 89), and judges him so favourably, that some special connexion with him or his descendants may safely be assumed; H. seems to have found one of his sons, Tritanaechmes, satrap of Babylon (i. 192), while Artabazus himself was given (circ. 477 B. C.) the satrapy of Dascyleum, to promote the treacherous intrigues of Pausanias (cf. v. 32 n.; Thuc. i. 129), and was succeeded in his satrapy by his descendants, the genealogy being probably i-v. 1 and Anab. vi, vii) tau/thn.

The Bottiaei coalesce with the colonists and act in close conjunction with them (Thuc. i. 57 f.; ii. 79, 99, 101; iv. 7). The cities of Pallene were in alliance (\u00a7 2 ad fin.); so Scione (vii. 123. 1 n.) furnished a contingent for the defence of Potidaea. o(/kws gra/yeie, 'as often as'; for the optative 52. 1; i. 17. 2 ad fin. glufi/das: probably the points on each side of the notch, where the arrow is held by the fingers.

Aeneas Tacticus 31, repeating this story, reads peri/, but that would mean that the notch was wrapped round, which would make the arrow so clumsy as to be useless. For a similar method of communication cf. Caesar, B. G. v. 48. parh/isan. The town reached across the Isthmus, so the Persians, being without ships and wishing to get to the side towards Pallene, tried to pass along the marshy shore at low tide, but when they got two-fifths of the way were caught by the tide. Aristeus was more successful (Thuc. i. 63). Potidaea was under the special protection of the god from whom it was named, Posidon, whose image, taken perhaps from this very statue (Head, H. N. p. 212), was on its coins. Such extraordinary tidal waves were naturally ascribed to him, as were earthquakes (vii. 129. 4). No doubt it is this remarkable sign of the wrath of the god which leads H. to dwell on an unimportant episode. Persian fleet mustered at Samos.

The old city of Lebadeia stood at the mouth of a wild gorge, probably on the eastern bank of the Hercyna, about ten minutes north of the modern town, while the grove of Trophonius was on the western bank (Strabo 414; Paus. ix. 37. 5, with Frazer, v. 196 f.). The legend of Trophonius is the common folk-tale of the Clever Thief (cf. ii. 121 b; for his end cf. i. 31. 3 n.). Trophonius appears to have been originally the chief local god of Lebadeia (Paus. i. 34. 2); later, in accordance with a common tendency of Greek religion as it became systematized, he was degraded into a hero. On inscriptions he is sometimes distinguished from and sometimes identified with Zeus Basileus: Strabo (l. c.) speaks of an oracle of Zeus Trophonius, and Livy (xlv. 27) of a temple, yet Pausanias (ix. 39. 5) distinguishes Zeus Basileus and Trophonius. Cicero seems to identify Trophonius with Mercury (de Nat. Deor. iii. 22. 56). His statue by Praxiteles had the appearance and attributes of Aesculapius, particularly the snake, perhaps the earliest representation of the god (cf. Paus. ix. 39. 3). Pausanias (l. c.) describes the way of consulting the oracle from his own experience. The inquirer had first to live some days in the shrine of 'Agathos Daemon' and Tyche, to eat sacrificial meats and wash in the water of the Hercyna, and to sacrifice a ram. Then at night he was taken to the springs of Lethe and Mnemosyne, to drink forgetfulness of the past and memory for the revelations to come. Thence the priests took him to a vaulted cave on the hill; from the upper chamber he climbed down a small ladder into a pit some six feet across and twelve feet deep, bearing honey-cakes in his hands to appease the chthonian deity. There, lying on his back, he worked his way feet foremost through a small opening into the inner shrine and returned in the same way afterwards. While still bewildered and under the influence of the deity, the priests placed him on the chair of Mnemosyne, and asked him what he had seen and heard. His answer was interpreted and versified (Paus. iv. 32. 5) by the priests. For Trophonius cf. Farnell, Greek Hero for 'he visited Thebes first and when he was come there'; cf. i. 17. 2. *)ismhni/w|: cf. i. 92. 1 n.; v. 59. i(roi=si = e)mpu/roisi: 'burnt sacrifices'; in Thebes omens were taken from the flame or the ashes of the victim burnt (Soph. Oed. Tyr. 21mantei/a| spodw=|). So the Iamidae (ix. 33. 1) took auspices at the altar of Zeus at Olympia; cf. Pind. Ol. viii. 2. katekoi/mhse e)s *)amfia/rew. Amphiaraus was consulted by sleeping in his shrine on the skin of a sacrificed ram (Paus. i. 34. 5). Mys probably visited not his most famous shrine near Oropus (Paus. i. 34) but one near Thebes. Amphiaraus, probably originally a chthonian deity, became in legend an Argive hero, one of the Seven against Thebes. The earth was said to have swallowed him up, by some at Harma (Paus. l. c.; ix. 19. 4), by others at a place between Potniae and Thebes, where there was a shrine (Paus. ix. 8. 3). This would seem to be the place meant here, since the offerings made by Croesus to Amphiaraus were transferred to the temple of Ismenian Apollo at Thebes (i. 52), and the refusal to permit Thebans to consult the oracles reads like a taboo against natives. Strabo expressly tells us (404) that the oracle of Amphiaraus was brought to Oropus from Cnopia in the Theban territory, and this may have happened just after H. wrote (cf. Frazer, v. 31). In any case the usages would seem to have been similar. We may compare the oracle of Calchas at Drium in Apulia (Strabo 284) and of Faunus Aen. vii. 81 f.; Ovid, Fast. iv. 649). Amphiaraus was consulted chiefly by the sick; grateful patients cast gold or silver coins into the sacred spring (Paus. i. 34. 4); for parallels cf. Frazer, ad loc. Plutarch (Arist. 19; Mor. 412) says that Mardonius' envoy to Amphiaraus was a Lydian, and that the vision vouchsafed to him foretold that Mardonius should be slain by a stone. *ptw/|ou. Mount Ptous was said to be named from a son of Athamas and Themisto (Apollodorus i. 9. 2). It is a range with three peaks (trika/rhnon, Pind. fr. 70 ap. Strabo 412) between Lake Copais and the Euboic sea. On a conspicuous hill connected with it by a ridge is the ruined acropolis of Acraephia (Paus. ix. 23. 5 with Frazer), north of the Athamantian plain (cf. vii. 197. 1 n.). Fifteen stadia away from Acraephia, in a little valley beneath the true summit of Mount Ptous (Mount Palagia), was the temple of Apollo, excavated by the French School (1885-6, 1891). For an account of it cf. Frazer, v. 100-3. The oracle declined after the destruction of Thebes (335 B. C., Paus. ix. 23. 6), and disappeared before the days of Plutarch (Mor. 412-14). The miracle lay in the fact that the god answered the inquirer in his own tongue, which was doubtless unknown to the Promantis. He also apparently answered so clearly that there was no need of skilled priests to interpret the wild and whirring words. Pausanias (l. c.) spoils the story by making Mys inquire of the god in Carian. For Alexander and Bubares cf. v. 21. 2. e)/sxe, 'had her to wife'; cf. iii. 31. 6, 68. 3, 88. 3, &c. *)ala/banda was always a Carian city, and was ruled by a Carian, Ariodolis (vii. 195).

The Proxenoi received the ambassadors of the states they represented, procured for them admission to the assembly, and in general looked after the interests of the state by which they were appointed (cf. ix. 85. 3). The title pro/cenos kai\\ eu)erge/ths was often bestowed as an honour in recognition of such services as Alexander implies (ch. 140. b 1) he had rendered Athens. It was eagerly sought by foreign princes and powers (Xen. de Vect. iii. 11); a number of such honoured benefactors are to be found in decrees conferring such honours at Athens are of the middle of the fifth century. Cf. Hicks, 39; C.I.A. cases Hicks, 77, 89, 97, 111, 113; Xen. Hell. vi. 1. 4.

Alexander himself is included (cf. ch. 139). It is usual in ordinals to count in both the beginning and the end, but the method seems strange when it causes a man to be counted among his own ancestors (cf. i. 91. 1) or descendants (i. 13. 2). Thucydides agrees as to the number of the Macedonian kings and in tracing their descent from Temenus of Argos (ii. 99 f.; v. 80); but in the fourth century another account was current, probably derived from Theopompus (fr. 30, F. H. G. i. &c.). By this Caranus ('head leader'), son or brother of the Argive king Pheidon (cf. vi. 127. 3 n.), is made the founder of the Macedonian dynasty, and is succeeded by *koi=nos and *turi/mmas (Satyr. fr. 21, F. H. G. iii. 164), who precede the first Perdiccas. The object of this lengthening of the line was to make the Macedonian dynasty at least as old as the Median (cf. vi. 127. 3 n.). e)c *)/argeos. Argos in the Peloponnese appears as the ancestral home of the family in all versions of the legend (Isocr. Phil. 32). But the Argos with which the Steph. Byz.), near the source of the Haliacmon. They first held the fruitful valleys there (valley of Kastoria), and the hill country as far as the source of the Erigon; this is the Upper Macedonia (cf. vii. 128. 1 n.) where the three brothers served (inf.), and to which Caranus went by order of an (Euphorion, vii. 8. 9) later made Aegae their capital, and established an hegemony over the kindred tribes (cf. Thuc. ii. 99) in Upper Macedon, the Lyncestae, Orestae, Elimiotae, as well as over the coastlands as far as the Axius. The likeness of name (Argos and Argeadae) led the Macedonian kings, at least from the time of Alexander I (cf. v. 22. 2 n.; ix. 45. 2), to claim descent from the Heracleid kings of Peloponnesian Argos, just as the princes of the Lyncestae did from the Corinthian Bacchiads, those of the Molossi from Achilles (Strabo 327), and the Illyrian Enchelees (cf. v. 61. 2 n.) from Cadmus. Yet their names are not even Greek, and their origin is at least doubtful (cf. v. 22. 2 n.). In the legend the name Argos is misinterpreted, and Temenus is falsely inserted. Probably e)s *)illuriou/s is put in because these Argives are believed to have come to Macedon by land from the West. Otherwise the story is a folk-tale, current among the Argeadae, about their earlier homes and the claim of their princes to their possession. *gaua/nhs: probably = bouko/los, since in Sanskrit g\u00f4 = bou=s.

Another point of resemblance is the superiority of the youngest brother. u(perbalo/ntes. The Scardus range, stretching south from the source of the Axius (Vardar), is crossed by two passes (Tozer, Highlands of Turkey, i. 350), one at Kalkandele, the other leading by Lake Lychnitis (Okhrida) eastwards to Aegae (Vodena), later the Via Egnatia (op. cit. i. 149). This route would take the brothers to the Lyncestis; Lebaea is otherwise unknown. ta\\ lepta\\ tw=n proba/twn: sheep and goats (i. 133. 1). For this primitive simplicity cf. Od. vi. 57 f.

Perdiccas symbolically claims possession of the hearth (e(sti/a) of the house and thus of the whole estate of its master, and then calls the sun to witness his claim to house and land. The primitive Germans seem to have looked on the sun as the original source of all rights to land; so Grimm says of a symbolic taking possession of a new fief: 'The new holder early in the morning rode out fully armed and with his naked sword (cf. ma/xaira) made three strokes crossways in the air as soon as he saw the sun rise'; cf. also iii. 86. In Euripides' play, Archelaus, an exile from Argos, destroys Cisseus, the treacherous king of Macedon, in his own snare, and fleeing thence founds a city, named, from the goat which led him, Aegae (Hygin. 219). He appeared on the stage as a goatherd (Dio Chrys. p. 70-1). In the other version Caranus, after helping Cisseus, the king of Orestis, to conquer the Eordi, guided by a goatherd surprised the stronghold which he renamed Aegae. Both stories emphasize the part played by a goat, and it is significant that the goat remained the standard of Macedon and the device on its coins. a)/llhn gh=n *makedoni/hs. *makedoni/s proper, the district round Aegae, the home and burial-place of the Temenid kings.

Cf. vii. 73 n.; Euphor. fr. 24; Strabo 330, fr. 25, 680. Midas here is the mythical founder of the royal house (cf. i. 14. 3 n.), son of Gordias and Cybele. He invented the flute (Plin. N. H. vii. 204), founded the worship of his mother, and was judge of the contest between Apollo and Marsyas; cf. Hygin. fab. 191; Orphica (Abel), fr. 310. Silenus ordinarily figures as the oldest and wisest of the rout of Satyrs (cf. vii. 26. 3 n.); perhaps he was originally a deity of fruitful streams (Lat. silanus) and fertile gardens. He unites the wisdom of the sage with drunken sensuality, and can inspire both music and prophecy (cf. Marsyas, vii. 26. 3 n.). h(/lw: by Midas who put wine in the spring from which Silenus was wont to drink (Xen. Anab. i. 2. 13; Paus. i. 4. 5). The fact that Pausanias places the fountain at Ancyra and Xenophon at Thymbrium, while Bion (ap. Athen. 45 E) puts it in the Paeonian land near the borders of the Maedi, is one more argument for an early migration (vii. 20 n. and App. I, p. 371 f.). Silenus is said to have been asked what was the best thing for man, and in reply to have pointed out the futility of human hopes and endeavours, and to have praised death. (Aristotle ap. Plut.

The use of the dative with e)nora=n instead of the accusative (as in i. 170. 2) is without parallel; Stein justifies it by its use with the kindred word suneide/nai (ix. 60. 3; v. 24. 3, &c.). xei/r is joined with du/namis as a symbol of power in iv. 155. 4; cf. Isaiah lix. 1, 'Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save'; cf. l. 2, and for kings Ovid, Her. xvii. 166 'An nescis longas regibus esse manus?' The term 'long-armed' is therefore to Eastern kings (so Nala, ii. 12 'Bhimas ma`h\u00e2b\u00e2hur' and Artaxerxes makro/xeir), though the term was in this case supposed by some to refer to a physical peculiarity (Plut.

Such a reference to the Athenian Empire is too na\u00efve an anachronism, nor is it supported by the praise of Athens as a liberator (Blakesley, Rawlinson), for this refers to the Epigoni and the Heracleids in the mythical age, as is shown by to\\ pa/lai (\u00a7 3), cf. ix. 27.

Both Alexander and Mardonius (or rather his master Xerxes) were really legitimate national kings, not tyrants, and H. himself calls the kings of Macedon basileu/s, though he styles the monarchy turanni/s (ch. 137. 2). The opprobrious term is dramatically appropriate in the mouth of an enemy (cf. for the opposite case vii. 161 n.). Further, the tyrants of Ionia had been the natural allies of the Mede (iv. 137, &c.), and, as the 'Holy Alliance' and Dreikaiserbund have shown, there is a certain natural affinity between monarchies. This answer to Mardonius as well as that to the Spartans (inf. is said by Plutarch (Arist. 10) to be due to Aristides, but this is no doubt a mere conjecture. For the formula cf. v. 92 a 1 n. and especially Soph. Phil. For Persian disregard of gods and heroes cf. ix. 76, and for destruction of temples ch. 109. 3 n.

This noble assertion of Hellenic nationality may be unhistorical, but it is in harmony with the spirit of the struggle against the Mede. As Myres points out (Anthropology and the Classics, p. 134), 'H. here first gives us a reasoned scheme of ethnological criteria.' 'Common descent, common language, common religion, and common culture, these are the four things that make a nation one, and conversely the things which, if unconformable, hold nations apart.' He further thinks that H. gives the four criteria in what he regards as the order of their relative importance, and contrasts the somewhat similar order, laying stress first on physical characteristics, adopted by H. (iv. 23) in describing the Argippaei, with that of Aeschylus in the Supplices (234 f.). u(mi=n e)kpeplh/rwtai, 'the kindness on your part is complete.' u(mi=n and u(mew=nsup. are put forward for emphasis.

The relative clause shows that this union is no mere possibility, but certain to occur, as it had before. perigi/nesqai, = 'conquer', governs the accusative on the analogy of nika=n. H. clearly holds that the idea of throwing Persian gold into the scale, and of gaining by bribery what they had failed to win by force, dates from the defeat of Salamis (cf. ch. 5, 41 and Diod. xi. 28). Nor is it improbable that the question was then mooted. But the first clear instances of such bribery, the missions of Megabazus (457 B. C.; cf. Thuc. i. 109) and of Arthmius of Zeleia, are later. Though Plutarch (Them. 6) seems to place the latter at the time of Xerxes' invasion, and attributes the man's punishment to Themistocles, the words of the decree inscribed on the pillar 271; Ael. Aristid. Dind. i. 310), make it probable that Athens was then at variance with the Peloponnesians. Again, though Plutarch ascribes the decree to Themistocles, Craterus (quoted by the scholiast on Aristides, l. c.) assigned it to Cimon. If so, Arthmius' mission must be placed after the outbreak of the war between Athens and the Peloponnese and the subsequent recall of Cimon, i.e. after 457 B. C. (cf. E. Meyer, iii. \u00a7 337; Busolt, ii. 653, n. 3). a)gnwmosu/nhs: cf. v. 83. 1 n. pursoi=si. The use of fire-signals has its origin in the beacon lighted to warn the neighbourhood of a foe's approach. It was frequent in the fifth century (cf. vii. 183. 1; Thuc. ii. 94, iii. 22. 80; and esp. Aesch. Agam. 280 f. the signals telling the fall of Troy). Apparently the numbers and direction of a hostile force could be signalled (Thuc. l. c.); yet for want of an adequate code, only more or less foreseen contingencies could be signalled even in the days of Polybius, though much attention had been paid to the art (Polyb. x. 43 f.). dia\\ nh/swn without article = the mid-Aegean isles (cf. iii. 96. 1; vii. 95. 1), but those west of Delos were no longer in Persian hands (viii. 132).

Probably the reckoning is inclusive (Busolt, ii. 722, n. 2), so that as Xerxes took Athens about Sept. 25, 480 B. C.

R. xxiii. 36 f.) that the Greek writers are in substantial agreement as to the fate of Cyrsilus or Lycides, and that the transference of this famous case of lynching to the previous year (480 B. C.), when the Athenians retired before Xerxes, is a confusion due to Cicero's (de Off. iii. 11, \u00a7 48) misinterpretation of Demosthenes (de Cor. \u00a7\u00a7 202, 204). It is clear from H. and Lycurgus (in Leocratem, \u00a7 122) that the lynching took place in Salamis, and was a well-known case recorded in a decree. Demosthenes' date (\u00a7 202) is vague, 'when the Athenians had the hardihood to abandon their land and city and take to their ships,' but may as probably refer to the continued or repeated exodus of 479 as to 480 B. C.; and by stating (\u00a7 202), in language reminiscent of H. (viii. 140), that Athens had received offers from the king of Persia, by which she might have kept her own land and been given more, Demosthenes really fixes the event to 479, since in 480 Xerxes never offered Athens any such terms. Cicero has blundered, and H. is confirmed by the Greek orators. Probably, however, he has inadvertently substituted an ominous (cf. vii. 180) patronymic (Lycides = son of Lycus, 'wolfling') for the victim's true name Cyrsilus. The lynching of Cyrsilus is paralleled by the fury of the Hollanders in tearing De Witt to pieces. An Athenian embassy to Sparta ends Sparta's hesitation and leads to the dispatch of a Spartan force. e)/pempon. Plutarch says (Arist. ch. 10) that this was done on the motion of Aristides, and that the envoys named in the decree were Cimon, Xanthippus, and Myronides; cf. Busolt, ii. 721, n. 5. The Hyacinthia fell in the Spartan month *(ekatmobeu/s. They followed shortly after the Isthmian games (Xen. Hell. iv. 5. 1 f.), which took place in the early summer (Thuc. viii. 3, 9, 10). Apparently they usually fell in Thargelion (May), but this year, through intercalation in the Spartan Calendar, in Skirophorion (June); Busolt, ii. 722, n. 2. This prae-Dorian festival was celebrated annually at Amyclae in honour of Apollo and of Hyacinthus, the beautiful youth whom he had slain accidentally by a cast of his quoit. Hyacinthus seems to personify the vegetation dried up by summer's heat. On the first day the offerings of the dead were made to Hyacinthus; his urn, which was behind a closed iron door beneath Apollo's altar, was opened, and his ashes drenched with wine and milk (Paus. iii. 19. 3). Abstinence and melancholy marked the day; no garlands were worn, no paeans sung, and only plain unleavened cakes were eaten. The second day was a joyful festival sacred to Apollo; boys celebrated the praises of Apollo in anapaestic measures to the accompaniment of cithara and flute; there was a horse race of boys and a solemn procession of maidens in chariots. Probably the robe woven by Spartan women (Paus. iii. 16. 2) was then presented to the god. Of the third day no details are known; the importance of the whole festival is shown by the anxiety of all Spartans and especially the Amyclaeans to return home to keep it even in time of war (Xen. Hell. iv. 5. 11; Paus. iii. 10. 1, iv. 19. 4). h)=gon.

H.'s account of the long delay and sudden dispatch of the Spartans is obviously inadequate. The wall was probably defensible in the autumn of 480 B. C. (viii. 71). Again, there can have been no need for a Tegean to show the Spartan government that 'a great door to the Peloponnese was open' from the sea, if the Athenian navy changed sides (cf. Plut. de Mal. 41. 871 E). But the delay, as well as the secrecy and speed of the mobilization can be explained if we remember (1) that Argos had an understanding with Mardonius (ch. 12), (2) that the Eleans and Mantineans were at least wavering, since they arrived too late for the battle of Plataea (ch. 77), and afterwards banished their generals, presumably for Medism; indeed no Arcadians except the men of Tegea and Orchomenus (ch. 28) fought at Plataea. The Argives may have hoped to anticipate the strategy of Alcibiades in 418 B. C. (Thuc. v. 57 f.) by cutting off the Spartans from their northern allies. This explains why the Spartans marched by Orestheum (ch. 11. 2 n.) well away from the Argive frontier. It may, however, well be true that the Ephors were at last induced to risk an attack from Argos and a rising in Arcadia, by the fear that the loyalty of Athens would stand no further strain. H. puts the whole Spartiate force at 8,000 (vii. 234. 2 n.). The 5,000 here may be meant for two-thirds of the host, a common proportion (Thuc. ii. 10; iii. 15), or for a corps of 1,000 from each Spartan village (cf. ch. 53 n.). For the Helots cf. ch. 28. 2 n. and Appendix XIX. 2. The eclipse, which was partial, was on October 2, 480 B. C. (Busolt, ii. 715). Cleombrotus must have contemplated attacking the Persians as they retreated from Attica, probably by marching through the Megarid to occupy the passes of Cithaeron in their rear (cf. ch. 13, 14). But to risk all that had been won at Salamis in another battle was utterly opposed to the cautious policy of Sparta. The eclipse only justified a timidity in keeping with the situation and with the orders no doubt given to Cleombrotus. The return home was due to the approach of winter, during which a Greek force was always disbanded. They then came back to complete the wall in the spring. *eu)rua/nakta. The genealogy implied seems to be but if Euryanax be the son of Dorieus who fell in Sicily (cf. v. 41-6) he should have been king before Leonidas. Perhaps Dorieus by going abroad (cf. vi. 70. 1 n.) forfeited the throne or renounced it for himself and his descendants, or possibly the Dorieus here mentioned belonged to a younger branch of the royal house. pai/zete: of the music, dances, and processions on the second day of the Hyacinthia cf. ch. 7. 1 n. e)p' o(/rkou: a curious and unparalleled variant for su\\n o(/rkw| (Xen.

S. xv. 27 f.) above the little plain of Alea between Marmaria and Papari. It lay not on the direct route from Sparta to Tegea and the north, which led too near the Argolid and through Mantinea, but on an alternative route up the Eurotas towards Megalopolis, which turned near Oresthasium to Area Pal lantium and the plain of Tegea and Mantinea (cf. Loring, op. cit. route c, pp. 47-52). It was used by the Spartans again in 418 B. C. (Thuc. v. 64) for the same reason, and served then as a musteringplace for their Arcadian allies. cei/nous: Cic. de Off. i. 12. 37 (cf. ch. 53. 2, 55.

The lower town, the Acropolis having been burnt down in 480 B. C. (viii. 53. 2).

Either (1) by the long and narrow defile through Mount Cithaeron, starting from Eleutherae and passing through Dryoscephalae (ch. 39. 1 n.), or (2) by the even more difficult path across Mount Parnes by Phyle and Panactum, or (3) by the circuitous route followed by Mardonius according to H. (ch. 15). The Peloponnesians might cross Cithaeron direct from Megara either along the coast by Pegae and Aegosthena, or by the Vilia pass near Plataea, and so cut Mardonius' connexion with Thebes. It is most unlikely that Mardonius, who had determined to fight in Boeotia, led his whole army, or indeed any large portion of it, back towards Megara in the hope of cutting off the Greek vanguard. He merely threw out a cavalry screen to cover his own retreat and to prevent the Greeks advancing through the Megarid (ch. 13 n.). Pausanias (i. 44. 4) preserves a tradition that Persian archers reached the neighbourhood of Pegae. e(kasta/tw. For a similar remark cf. iv. 204. H. is, as often, weak on the points of the compass\u2014the Persian force was further west in Thessaly or at Thermopylae, not to speak of Delphi\u2014but he is right if he means that this detachment of cavalry penetrated furthest into Greece towards the south-west. Decelea, on a hill near Tatoi, commands the road leading from the Attic plain over Mount Parnes to Oropus and Tanagra. The road ascends to the summit of the pass through wooded ravines, but is not difficult. Probably H. only gives us the route of the main column under Mardonius, and the Persians used other passes also (Delbr\u00fcck, Perserkriege, p. 143 f.). boiwta/rxai, eleven in number, formed the executive of the Boeotian league (Thuc. iv.

Pausanias (ix. 4. 4) puts it forty stades down the Asopus from the point where the road from Plataea to Thebes crossed the stream. Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 153-4) follows Leake in placing it near Darimari, and thinks the Persian fort guarded the Asopus where the road from Attica by Panactum crossed it. Grundy (p. 449 n., 463 n.) would place Scolus not far east of the road from Dryoscephalae to Thebes, and the Persian camp, on the Asopus where that road crosses it; this seems the more probable view. e)n gh=| *qhbai/wn. Strabo (409) extends the territory of Thebes over the Asopus to Mount Cithaeron, and includes in it not only Scolus but Erythrae and Scaphae (Eteonus) also. Yet these townships would seem to have been traditionally united to Plataea (cf. vi. 108). They are so regarded by some authorities quoted by Strabo (l. c. and by Pausanias (ix. 2. 1, 4. 4). At some date before 424 B. C. (perhaps only when Plataea fell in 427) these small places became subject to Thebes, and doubtless remained so till the peace of Antalcidas, 387 B. C. (cf. Oxyr. Papyr. v, p. 171, and notes, pp. 223-7). e)/keire. He had to cut down trees, even fruit-trees (ch. 97), to build his square wooden fort (ch. 65. 1, 70. 1). The fort was not, however, merely a place of refuge; doubtless it commanded the passage of the Asopus, the bridge being further defended on the south side by a bridge-head. Both here and in ch. 65 it is distinguished from the camp, which was clearly larger, and which must have been entirely on the north side of the Asopus. The sites of Erythrae and Hysiae are still matters of controversy. Munro (l. c.) again follows Leake in placing Hysiae close under Mount Cithaeron, just to the right of the main road from Athens and Eleutherae to Thebes, and Erythrae at Katsula about two miles east of his site for Hysiae. Grundy (pp. 458-60 and 464) would put Hysiae just above Kriekouki and Erythrae above the road from Eleutherae to Thebes. The two towns would thus be within a mile of each other. H. probably only means that the Persians occupied the valley over against Erythrae and Hysiae, as we find the Greeks in possession of Erythrae a little later (ch. 19. 3). Attaginus, along with Timagenidas, led the Medizing oligarchy of Thebes (ch. 86. 1, 88). Stories of the banquet at Thebes, and of the testing of the Phocians. *qersa/ndrou. The story is notable because it is one of the four cases (cf. ii. 55; iii. 55, and iv. 76) in which H. gives the name of his informant (cf. Introduction, p. 29). The fifty 'Thebans' doubtless included men from other cities of Boeotia. kli=nai. The subject must be Attaginus, who as host would arrange this.

Probably the Persians had lost confidence, as is shown by the evacuation of Attica and by the fortification of the camp; possibly, too, they were divided amongst themselves, Artabazus disapproving of the designs of Mardonius (ch. 41, 66).

The Greeks may have expected to find Mardonius still in Attica: indeed, the repeated sacrifice would seem to imply that the advance into Boeotia was beyond their original plan. Yet, in any case, they would naturally turn aside to Eleusis to pick up the Athenian troops, and would cross Cithaeron by the good road thence. *)eruqra/s: cf. ch. 15. 3 n. e)pi\\ th=s u(pwre/hs. This position on the foothills of Cithaeron would give them protection against the attacks of the Persian cavalry, and would also cover the passes and roads to Attica and the Megarid, by which supplies and reinforcements reached them (ch. 28. 2, 38. 2, 39. 2). *masi/stios (cf. vii. 79).

They charged successively by squadrons (vii. 81 n.), not all together (ch. 23). gunai=kas: the bitterest taunt; ch. 107. 1, cf. viii. 88. 3 The station of the Megarians open to cavalry attack was doubtless the comparatively level ground where the road from Eleutherae to Thebes comes down from the pass. Grundy (p. 458 f.) rightly holds that the Greeks had come over the Dryoscephalae pass, and now were drawn up with their centre astride of the road, the Megarians being in the left centre of the Greek line (ch. 28. 6, 31. 5). Macan's suggestion that the Greeks were but just emerging from the pass in a column headed by the Megarians or by the Athenians is opposed to the clear statement of H. (ch. 19. 3). Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 157) puts forward the over-elaborate hypothesis that Pausanias marched with the bulk of his forces by Oenoe and Panactum, and finding himself checked by the Persian stockade, deployed his army to the left along the base of the mountain, continually extending his left flank westward as more troops came into line. Thus the Megarians might temporarily form the extreme left of the army. The Athenians would next come up (to take post to their left), and on them would naturally fall the duty of relieving the distressed Megarians. oi( trihko/sioi. There is no evidence that there was at Athens a permanent picked corps of 300, as the oi( would naturally imply, though we hear of the selection of 300 picked men for special service before Syracuse (Thuc. vi. 100). The full details given of this cavalry skirmish were probably told to H. by some near relation of Olympiodorus. He was no doubt the father of the more famous Lampon, the seer and interpreter of signs and oracles, derided in comedy (e.g. Arist. Av. 521), especially by Cratinus for superstition, but the friend and adviser of Pericles. Lampon was one of the ten commissioners sent out to found Thurii; hence H. would naturally have met him there, even if he had not in Athens. tou\\s toco/tas (cf. ch. 60; Aesch. Pers. 463). These archers were citizens of the Thetic class (C. I. A. i. 54. 79 toco/tai a)stikoi/), not the Scyths who were first enlisted by Pericles. E. Meyer (iii. 408) suggested that they numbered 800, and thus explained convincingly the redundancy in H.'s total of light-armed troops at Plataea (ch. 29). At the beginning of the Peloponnesian war (Thuc. ii. 13; Ath. Pol. 24) these archers numbered 1,600: hence Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 147) would assign the other 800 at this time to the Athenian fleet, since we learn from Plutarch (Them. 14) that four archers served on each ship at Salamis. proe/xwn, 'being in front of the others'; cf. iv. 120. 3; Hom.

Such unbridled exhibitions of grief were characteristic of Persians (iii. 66. 1; viii. 99. 2 n.) as of other Orientals (vi. 58). Shaving the head as a sign of mourning was a common custom (ii. 36) among Greeks (vi. 21) as well as Persians (Q. Curtius x. 17) and other Orientals (Job v. 20). Cutting off the manes of horses was a Macedonian and Thessalian form of mourning (Plut. Pelop. 34; Eur. Alc. 428 f.), an honour paid, along with others of the same kind, by Alexander the Great to Hephaestion. Advance of the Greeks to a second position. Dispute between Athens and Tegea for precedence. Battle array of the Greeks and Persians, and composition of their forces. Apparently the wagon bearing Masistius' body was drawn along a road behind the Greek lines, i. e. from Erythrae towards Plataea, though Macan, believing that the Greeks were still in column in the pass, thinks it went up the road through the pass to the rear. e)pikatabh=nai. They moved towards Plataea, but also forwards down into the plain. H. does not understand at all the importance of this movement; by it the Greeks assumed the offensive and tried to provoke a battle. Yet if they really hoped to turn the Persian right by forcing the passage of the Asopus (Grundy, p. 473; Munro, J. H. S. xxiv. 158), this advance into the plain was absurdly rash in face of the superior Persian cavalry. Cf. App. XXII. 5. *gargafi/hs *)androkra/teos. We cannot be certain that the two points given are intended to mark the extreme limits of the Greek position, though the spring Gargaphia is clearly held by the Spartans (49. 3), the right wing of the army (28. 2), and the precinct of Androcrates, a Plataean hero (Plut. Arist. 11), very probably defines the position of the left wing. Neither spring nor precinct can be identified with certainty. Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 37-8) still maintains that Apotripi, the traditional site, is the true Gargaphia, but Grundy (p. 465 n.) and Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 159) seem right in preferring Leake's Gargaphia, a more abundant spring in a much more conspicuous position. The heroon of Androcrates is placed by Grundy (466 f.) within three-quarters of a mile of Plataea, to the right of the road to Thebes (cf. Thuc. iii. 24). Munro (l. c.) and Macan follow Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 38-40) in placing it at the church of St. John, a conspicuous site (cf. Plut. Arist. 11), and therefore preferable. They believe that Thucydides (l. c.) is distinguishing two roads to Thebes, which passed to the right and the left of the shrine. to\\ e(/teron ke/ras. The right wing as the post of honour belonged to the Spartans as leaders (ch. 28. 2; cf. vi. 111. 1 n.); the left wing is here in question. Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 41) argues strongly that the story of this quarrel for precedence is an Athenian invention. The dispute, if historical, must have taken place earlier, i. e. directly the Greeks fell into position on Mount Cithaeron. Now the Athenians were probably then already on the left (ch. 21), as they succour the Megarians. Further, the Tegeans are found occupying the position next the Spartans not only here (ch. 28) but at Mantinea in 418 B. C. (Thuc. v. 71) and at Corinth in 394 B. C. (Xen. Hell. iv. 2. 19). The tactical reasons for posting the Athenians on the left as the largest single corps of hoplites (8,000) with the best archers are obvious, if we remember that the left wing was most exposed to cavalry (ch. 49). *eu)rusqe/os: cf. ch. 27. 2 n. *)iw/nwn: cf. i. 146 n. to\\n *)isqmo/n. The fight took place on the boundary between the territories of Megara and Corinth (Paus. i. 44. 10). e(kato\\n e)te/wn, 'within a century' (for the genitive of time cf. ii. 115. 6) = the fourth generation. Temenus, Aristodemus and Cresphontes, the Heracleid leaders of the successful Dorian invasion were the fourth generation from Hyllus, as is seen in the genealogies (vii. 204; viii. 131). For Echemus cf. Pind. Ol. xi. 66 (of the foundation of the Olympic games by Heracles, o( de\\ pa/la| kudai/nwn *)/exemos *tege/an). This combat (cf.

As E. Meyer has shown (F. ii. 219), we have here an echo of the laud of Athens usual in funeral orations in the Ceramicus and in other panegyrics (cf. also vii. 161. 3 n.). These three mythical instances of valour and unselfishness were, along with Marathon (\u00a7 5), the regular themes of patriotic Athenian orators. Cf. 8. Similarly in the Tegean speech there is a little history and a large admixture of myth. proe/qhke, 'has laid on us the task of.' The idea seems to be that the Tegean has instituted a contest in self-laudatory panegyrics. Cf. Diod. iv. 57, 58, and especially Apollodorus, ii. 8. The Athenians refused to surrender the Heracleids to Eurystheus, and slew his sons in battle, while Hyllus came up with Eurystheus as he fled by the Scironian rocks and slew him. For another version cf. Euripides, Heraclidae. Apparently in the oldest form of the legend it was Adrastus who persuaded the Thebans to allow the Argive heroes to be buried at Thebes (cf. Pind. Ol. vi. 15 with schol.); at any rate the grave of Tydeus was there (Paus. ix. 18. 2, quoting Il. xiv. 124, a spurious line); then the Attic tragedians, &c., made Adrastus flee to Theseus at Athens, *)eleusi/nioi; Plut. Thes. 29; 58; Euripides, Supp. 634 f.), recovered the bodies and buried them at Eleusis (Euripides, op. cit.), where their tombs were shown (Paus. i. 39. 2). Thus the story was turned into a panegyric on Athens. Theseus is said to have carried off the queen of the Amazons, Antiope or Hippolyte (cf. iv. 110. 1 n.), from her land, going thither either as a companion of Heracles (Paus. i. Philoch. fr. 49, F.H.G. i. with his friend Pirithous (Pind. fr. 161). The Amazons in revenge invaded Attica and fought long and fiercely with Theseus near the Pnyx and Museum. These daughters of Ares seized the hill of Ares (Aesch. Eum. 688 f.) to attack the Acropolis thence (cf. viii. 52). In that neighbourhood was the Amazoneion (Diodor. iv. 28; Aesch. Eumen. 655 f.) and the graves of the Amazons (Plut. Thes. 27). Graves of Amazons were also to be seen at Cynoscephalae and Scotussa in Thessaly, at Chaeronea in Boeotia, (Plut. Thes. 27), and at Troezen (Paus. ii. 31. 4, 32. 9). Amazons are favourite subjects of sculptors and vase-painters. The fight with them was represented by Phidias on the shield of the Parthenos (Paus. i. 17. 2) and on the metopes of the Parthenon, and by Micon in the Stoa Poikile (Paus. i. 15. 2) and the Theseion (Paus. i. 17. 2). It is treated as the mythical counterpart of the Persian invasion. a)po\\ *qermw/dontos: cf. iv. 110. 1. ou) ti proe/xei, 'it avails naught.' The Athenian speaker glides gracefully away from the Trojan war, in which his countrymen played no great part; cf. vii. 161. 3 n. mou=noi dh/: very emphatic (cf. viii. 124. 3 n.). This insistence that the Athenians won Marathon by themselves ungratefully forgets the help of the Plataeans (cf. vii. 10. b 1). Attic orators follow the example of their advocate here; to the number of those who served on foot in the host of Xerxes (vii. 61-80). The assumption that they all fought at Marathon is purely gratuitous. The studied variety of phrases used by H. to express the same idea, viz. the juxtaposition of the various Greek contingents, is remarkable, especially if it be compared with the monotonous repetition of ch. 31. The great importance of this chapter for the question of Greek population is admitted even by Beloch (Bev\u00f6lkerung, p. 9), though he holds, probably wrongly, that the numbers of hoplites given rest on a mere estimate made by the historian. The repeated assertion that there were seven Helots to each Spartiate (ch. 10. 1, 29. 1, 61. 2) evidently rests on something more than mere conjecture. The words e)fu/lasson most naturally would mean that they were in personal attendance on their master, but elsewhere each Spartiate has but one squire (qera/pwn, cf. vii. 186. 2 n., 229. 1 n.). Kr\u00fcger would take it to mean that the light-armed Helots covered the right wing from the attacks of the Persian horse and archers; but though H. regards them as combatants (ma/ximoi, ch. 30; cf. 29. 8), there is nowhere any indication that they played an effective part in the fighting, though archers, and presumably other light troops, were urgently required (ch. 60). Hence at best they can only have been an army service corps (ch. 39, 50); cf. Appendix XIX. vii. 123. 1; viii. 127 f.) was a colony of Corinth (Thuc. i. 56). E. Meyer (iii. 235 n.) holds that it is unlikely that any Potidaeans fought at Plataea, and that H. put them in erroneously because he found their name on the memorial at Delphi (ch. 81 n.), while Beloch (l. c.) would derive the whole list of names from the same source. Both views seem unlikely; cf. ch. 81 n. Obst (Der Feldzug des Xerxes, pp. 62-6) accepts the numbers given by Herodotus for the contingents of hoplites, and argues for the presence of the Paleans and Potidaeans at Plataea, which Munro (C. A. H. iv. 323) now doubts. The only Arcadians who fought at Plataea were the men of Tegea and Orchomenus (cf. ch. 10 n.), though Mantineans and other Arcadians followed Leonidas (vii. 202) and Cleombrotus (viii. 72). The men of Tiryns and Lepreum were the only new recruits from Peloponnese. For Lepreum cf. iv. 148. 4. Tiryns and Mycenae were at the time of the Persian war independent communities; for their subsequent destruction cf. vi. 83 n. *xalxide/es. Macan holds that these are probably the native inhabitants and not Athenian Cleruchs, since the latter would naturally have been brigaded with the Athenians. In viii. 1 and 46, however, Chalcidians serve on ships provided by Athens. *pale/es. Beloch (l. c.) suggests that *pale/es is a misreading of the valei=oi (Eleans) extant on the Delphic serpent (ch. 81. 1 n.), but it seems far more probable that Pale really sent hoplites to Plataea, and, like Croton, Lemnos, and Seriphos, which each sent a single ship to Salamis, was not inscribed on the Delphic memorial because of the insignificance of its contingent. *megare/wn trisxi/lioi. Beloch (op. cit. and Klio vi. 52-7) holds that the 5,000 hoplites assigned to Corinth (\u00a7 3) and the 3,000 to Sicyon (\u00a7 4) and Megara are all exaggerated estimates. He points out (Bev\u00f6lk., p. 119) that the field army of Corinth in the Peloponnesian war and later is not much more than 3,000 strong (Thuc. i. 27, iv. 42-4, v. 57; Xen. Hell. iv. 2. 17), while Sicyon, whose force in 394 B.C. is but 1,500 (Xen. l. c.), and Megara he considers (pp. 118, 173) even less able to provide the contingents here given. But all these towns must have lost very much in strength during the period of the Athenian empire; all had been very important in the 6th century. *plataie/es e(cako/sioi. In spite of Beloch's doubts (p. 165) this number agrees very well with the data in Thucydides, for the Plataeans much outnumber their 300 Theban assailants (ii. 3), and still number 400 after the removal of all but those necessary to garrison the town (ii. 78). As the campaign was in their territory, they would come in full force, pandhmei/ (vi. 108) or panstratia=| (Thuc. v. 57). o)ktakisxi/lioi. If allowance be made for the hoplites serving on board the fleet (ch. 99 f.), this number agrees very well with the 9,000 or 10,000 said by late authors to have fought at Marathon (vi. 117 n.) and with the field army of 13,000 hoplites in 431 B. C., however we may explain the large number of men then used only for garrison duty (Thuc. ii. 13). For the whole number of citizens cf. v. 97 n. This calculation rests on the ordinary Greek assumption that each hoplite was accompanied by a light-armed attendant (cf. vii. 186. 1 n.). Mere camp-followers are not included (cf. maxi/mwn, ch. 30).

Grundy (p. 470, n. 473) still clings to his view that H. uses the Asopus in two senses. Here and in ch. 40 he admits that it refers to the main stream, the 'Thespian' Asopus, but in line 1 and elsewhere (especially in ch. 51. 1) he insists that H. uses the name for the brook marked 'A. 1' on his plan, the 'Plataean' Asopus. This cutting of the knot has not found favour with other writers (Woodhouse, J. H. S. xviii. 56; Munro, J. H. S. xxiv. 161; E. Meyer, iii, p. 413). The name is throughout applied to the main stream. Mardonius' foot was stationed on the left bank (ch. 36, 40, 59), to protect the road to Thebes, which was threatened by the Greeks in their second position (25. 2 n.).

No doubt the countries named might have furnished 50,000 men, but it is a suspicious circumstance that the European and the Asiatic forces of Mardonius are each just onesixth of those absurdly ascribed to Xerxes (vii. 184, 185 n.). Again, the fact that their line faced only the Athenians, Plataeans, and Megarians (11,600 hoplites with over 12,000 yiloi/) points to a force of some 25,000. The seers on either side, Tisamenus and Heges<*>tratus. (kai/ giving emphasis (i. 74. 3)); one would not have expected it of Persians. The Iamidae, who traced their descent from Iamus, son of Apollo (Pind. Ol. vi. 35-72; Paus. vi. 2. 5), were the most famous of the great families of soothsayers in Elis. They took auspices at the altar of Zeus at Olympia (Pind. Ol. vi. 5, 70; viii. 2, quoted viii. 133 n.) and furnished soothsayers to many Greek states (v. 44. 2; Paus. iv. 16. 1, vi. 2. 5, viii. 10. 5). They had a family tomb in Sparta (Paus. iii. 12. 8). *klutia/dhn here is a late gloss, and does not occur in Paus. iii. 11. 6, a passage obviously derived from this. Further, Cicero plainly distinguishes the Iamidae and the Clytidae; De Div. the Telliadae (ch. 37. 1). Again Pausanias, who traces the Iamidae to Iamus and Apollo (vi. 25), makes Clytius, the ancestor of the Clytids, a descendant of Melampus (vi. 17. 1), as does Homer (Od. xv. 241) though with a different pedigree. lewsfe/teron: a a(/paclego/menon, probably derived from lew/s, meaning full citizen (\u00a7 4). peri\\ go/nou. Probably, being childless, he adopted his brother's son (\u00a7 5), for Pausanias (iii. 11. 5) says that his grandson Hegias was with Lysander at Aegospotami as seer. cf. v. 102. 3. a)ske/wn de\\ penta/eqlon: cf. vi. 92. 2 n. The order of events in the Pentathlum seems to be best given by Eustathius the running metri gratia. Certainly the wrestling came after all the other contests; cf. Xen. Hell. vii. 4. 29; Bacchyl. ix. 30 f., especially h)\\ teleutai/as a)ma/rugma pa/las. Pausanias (iii. 11. 6) says that Tisamenus beat his opponent Hieronymus in running and jumping, but he was no doubt beaten by him in throwing the spear and the discus; hence the wrestling, the last event, was decisive. The wrestling then, as now, was decided by the best of three falls (Aesch. Eumen. 589 f.; Eur. 277 D; Anthol. Pal. xi. 316). Each had won a fall in this, so all depended on 'a single fall' (e(\\n pa/laisma), the last; this is better than to take e(\\n pa/laisma in a more general sense of 'the odd event'. For a full discussion cf. E. N. Gardiner, J. H. S. xxiii. 54 f. He shows that any competitor, e. g. Aristomedes of Phlius (Bacchyl. l. c.), who won three events, must have won outright (cf. that, if at the end, two or more competitors had scored an equal number of wins, account was taken of second and third places as apparently in the mythical pentathlum of Peleus (Philost.

This cannot mean that the seer was to share the actual command in war, for in comparison with this the grant of citizenship would be nothing. It seems to refer to the position of the kings as priests, since they offered sacrifice before all important undertakings (Xen. Rep. Lac. 13). Tisamenus was to act with them in this. xrhsmosu/nhs: here concrete 'request'; so keleuomosu/nh, i. 157. 2. tou/toisi mou/noisi: added to give clearness and emphasis to ou(/tw, 'on these conditions only.'

The legend is told with many variations of detail, but the general outline is as follows. The three daughters of Proetus, king of Tiryns, provoked the wrath of Dionysus by refusing to take part in his orgies (Hesiod, fr. 41, 42; ap. Apollodor. ii. 2. 2) or that of Argive Hera by contempt for her image and temple (Acusilaus ap. Apollodor. l. c.; Pherecydes, fr. 24; F. H. G. i. 74), and were punished with madness. They wandered in the wilderness and were joined by more and more Argive women, so that in despair the Argives summoned Melampus from the court of Neleus at Pylos (Apoll. i. 9. 11; Diodor. iv. 68). Melampus, well acquainted with the mysteries of Dionysus (cf. ii. 49), healed and purified the maidens, perhaps with Melampodium, black hellebore (Plin. N. H. xxv. at the temple of Artemis at Lusi (Paus. viii. 18. 8 with Frazer), or at that of Apollo in Sicyon (Paus. ii. 9. 8). For representations of the scene cf. Roscher, ii. 2573. As a reward one princess with a third of the kingdom was given by her brother, king Anaxagoras, to Melampus, and another to Bias (\u00a7 2) (Diod. iv. 68; Paus. ii. 18. 4). The legend seems to be Argive, and is ignored by Homer (Od. xv. 238 f.); Pindar (Paean iv. 28 in Oxyrh. Pap. v, p. 37) makes Melampus refuse the kingdom of Argos. proetei/nato: here not 'offered' but 'demanded'. Both meanings come from the original sense, propono (cf. vii. 6. 2 n.), while e)pore/getai = 'raises his demands'. mou=noi dh\\ polih=tai. This statement is clearly inaccurate, since Helots were occasionally admitted to citizenship as Mothakes (Phylarch. fr. 44; F. H. G. i. 347), though not as Neodamodeis (Thuc. vii. 19, 58, &c.). Again, in mythical times H. himself records the admission of the Minyae to citizenship (iv. 145), and implies the same of the Aegidae (iv. 149). To these cases, and perhaps also to the non-Dorian Talthybiadae (vii. 134) and the Epeunacti (Theopompus, fr. 190; F. H. G. i. 310), Aristotle may refer when he declares that in the days of the early kings the Spartans bestowed the citizenship freely (Pol. ii. 9. 17, 1270 a 35). H. must be taken to mean that Tisamenus and Hegias were the only foreigners admitted to Spartan citizenship in historical times, a striking example of an exclusiveness eventually fatal to the state; cf. Tac. Ann. xi. 24. H. clearly knew nothing of the alleged grants to Tyrtaeus (Plato, Leg. 629 A; Plutarch, Mor. 230 D) and to Alcman (Plut. Mor. 600 E). This brief summary is our earliest and most authentic record of an anti-Spartan movement in the Peloponnese, which does much to explain the free hand allowed to Athens in the Aegean after 476 B. C., and the rapid growth of her power. The most certain point in the movement is the sunoikismo/s at Elis before 470 (Diodor. xi. 54; Strabo 337) with the democratic changes that accompanied it, especially the formation of ten local tribes (Paus. v. 9. 5) and the establishment of a boulh/ of 500, later increased to 600 (Thuc. v. 47); cf. Busolt, iii. 116 f. The democratic constitution of Argos, with its popular assembly (Thuc. v. 28, 31), boulh/, and law court, may date from this time; certainly it is not later than 460 B. C. (cf. Busolt, iii. 114 f.). On the other hand the sunoikismo/s (Strabo 337) and the democratic movement at Mantinea (Ar. Pol. 1318 b 25-7), placed circ. 470 B. C. by Busolt (iii. 118), should be dated ten years later, since Mantinea took no part in the battle of Dipaea, and assisted Sparta in the Messenian war, i. e. at Ithome (Xen. Hell. v. 2, 3); cf. Meyer, iii. \u00a7 285. On the battles of Tegea and Dipaea later writers (e. g. Paus. iii. 11. 7; viii. 8. 6 and 45. 2; Isocr. Arch. 99) add little or nothing of value to H. Both should be dated near together in the time of the movement against Sparta, i. e. circ. 473-470 B. C. (Busolt, iii. 121 n. 1; Meyer, iii. \u00a7 285). Themistocles would then be in Argos intriguing against Sparta, if the traditional date for the fall of Themistocles (470 B. C.) refers not to his ostracism (as Meyer, iii. \u00a7 286 n.) but to his final expulsion and flight (Busolt, iii. 112 n. 2). Tegea would seem to have been hostile to Sparta just before as well as after the Persian war. At any rate, Hegesistratus found refuge there before 480 B. C. (ix. 37), and Leotychides afterwards (vi. 72). Apparently the Tegeans, though defeated in the battle here mentioned, defended their city with success (Simonides, fr. 103). They were, however, induced then or later by Cleandridas to accept oligarchy and Spartan hegemony. Yet they seem to have been still in alliance with Argos at the time of the destruction of Mycenae, i. e. circ. 464 B. C.; cf. vi. 83. 99), on the river Helison (Paus. viii. 30. 1), in the district Maenalia (Paus. iii. 11. 7), perhaps the modern Dabia. The Argives are believed to have been kept away from this battle by the siege of Tiryns (cf. vi. 83. 2 n.), and the Mantineans stood aloof, doubtless from hostility to Tegea (Meyer, iii, \u00a7 285). The Spartans, though greatly outnumbered (Isocr. l. c.), gained a decisive victory, which restored their prestige in the Peloponnese. *)isqmw=|, the reading of the MSS., is combining this passage with Thucydides' (i. 101-3) account of the third Messenian war and the siege of Ithome. It is therefore uncritical (with Paulmier) to correct to pro\\s *)iqw/mh|, especially as we know only of a siege and not of any battle at Ithome. The combat here mentioned is, like that of Stenyclarus in this war (ch. 64), elsewhere unnoticed.

In any case this Isthmus would seem to be an otherwise unknown place in Messenia. Stein is reminded of the legendary king of Messenia, Isthmius (Paus. iv. 3. 10).

The use of his overwhelming cavalry to cut communications was the obvious course for Mardonius (cf. App. XXII. 5). Even a temporary cutting of the lines, by such a raid as is here described, was serious, and might at any time be repeated. Dryoscephalae is usually rightly identified with the pass of Gyphto Kastro (cf. Grundy, 447, 493 n.; Frazer, Paus. v. 2), through which the main road from Athens and Eleusis by Eleutherae to Thebes passed in ancient as in modern times. This is the natural interpretation of Thucydides (iii. 24), and a modern traveller (Vischer, Erinner aus Griech. p. 533) states that the 'three heads' after which the Boeotians named the pass can be plainly distinguished from their side. On the other hand, the words ai( e)pi\\ *plataie/wn fe/rousi hardly suit this pass. Hence Munro would include under the name the whole group of passes (J. H. S. xxiv. 155 n.), and others, e. g. Stein and Rawlinson, identify 'Dryoscephalae' with Grundy's second pass. Through this came probably the main road to Thebes from Megara and the Peloponnese over Mount Kardyes by the modern Vilia (J. H. S. xxiv. 155, 156). Cleombrotus used it in 378 B. C., and thus avoided touching Attic territory (Xen. Hell. v. 4. 14, 19). Grundy's third road (called by him the Plataea-Megara road; cf. p. 456 n.) seems to be a rough track of no great importance, used as a short cut by travellers on foot or on horseback. peribalo/menoi: either 'surrounding' (Stein; cf.

It is, however, a suspicious circumstance that throughout the story of this campaign H. reckons in periods of ten days, i. e. in Greek weeks. The Athenian envoys are ten days in Sparta (ch. 8), the Greek army is in position inactive for ten days, it advances on Thebes ten days after the battle (ch. 86), while Thebes surrenders after a siege of twenty days (ch. 87. 1); cf. Busolt, ii. 726 n.; Meyer, iii. \u00a7 236 n. Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 58) further argues that the point of departure in H.'s chronology is uncertain; the words a)ntikathme/noisi e)n *plataih=si (cf. ch. 39. 1), usually and naturally taken to refer to the occupation of the second position by the Greeks (ch. 25), he would refer to the opening of the campaign when the Greeks seized their first position on the slopes of Cithaeron. He also suspects H. of duplicating the interval of two days between the closing of the passes and the final battle, regarding the two days of waiting as purposeless, and the Persian Council, the visit of Alexander, and the challenge of Mardonius as fictitious. He thus compresses the campaign from the occupation of the first position to the final battle within a space of eleven days. Such bold reconstructions must of necessity be hypothetical. We may, however, agree that H.'s chronology is too vague to be satisfactory, and that there is more than one improbable incident in his narrative. Especially we may note with Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 160) and Macan (ii. 349, 369, 376) the improbability that the Greeks remained so long in their advanced position on the Asopus Ridge, and that Mardonius on his part delayed so long the cutting of their communications (cf. Appendix XXII. 5). cf. viii. 126. 1 n. His prudent counsel is contrasted with the infatuation of Mardonius. He is to him what Solon is to Croesus, Croesus to Cyrus, or Artabanus and Demaratus to Xerxes. The idea is not that the whole army should or could find refuge within the walls of Thebes, but that the city should be made the base of the army, and the wooden fort on the Asopus (ch. 15. 2 n.) be given up. In view of the Greek advance, a base on the Asopus may well have seemed too far forward. The existence of plentiful supplies at Thebes is inconsistent with Alexander's report of a shortage on the Asopus (45. 2), since with superior cavalry it must have been easy to maintain communication between them. The statement here is probably accurate, as it comes from a better source (Busolt, ii. 730 n.) and is more in accord with the care of the Persians for their commissariat (cf. vii. 25). Grundy (pp. 476, 477), however, holds that the Phocians, who were threatening Mardonius's communications (ch. 31. 5), may have caused supplies to run short. For the suggestion of bribery cf. ch. 25 with 3. 1 n. Plutarch (Arist. 13) declares that there was at this time an oligarchic plot among the Athenians to overthrow the constitution, and if necessary to betray Greece to the Persian. The statement is regarded as probable by Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 36) and Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 149), and as at least possible by E. Meyer (iii. \u00a7 233) and Busolt (ii. 730); but it may be a mere anecdote designed to illustrate the great services of Aristides in quelling the conspiracy, or transferred from some other occasion, e. g. Marathon (Macan, ii. 88). ou)damw=s sugginwskome/nh: probably repeats and strengthens the idea of foolish obstinacy expressed in a)gnwmoneste/rh (cf. vii. 9. b 1), though it may mean 'in no way agreeing with Artabazus' (v. 94. 2; vi. 140. 2). sumba/llein, like doke/ein, be favourable, by repeated consultation. tw=n e)piklh/twn: cf. vii. 8. 1 n. This story may well be another attempt to explain why Delphi was not plundered by the Persians. Mardonius' knowledge of this oracle seems inconsistent with the expedition to Delphi in the previous year (cf. viii. 35 f., and especially 39 n.), unless we assume that he only heard of it when inquiring of the oracles (viii. 133 f.) in the winter of 480-79 B.

Glisas, mentioned in Homer (Il. ii. 504), lay north-east of Thebes, just south of Mount Hypatus and above the Aonian plain (Strabo 412; Paus. ix. 19. 3 with Frazer); its ruins are perched on the rocky hill of Tourleza. The Thermodon seems to be the Calamites, rising west of Harma and flowing through the Aonian plain to the lake of Hylica (Frazer, Paus. v, p. 62). The fight between the Thebans and the Epigoni was said to have taken place in this region. proelh/lato: impersonal = nocte multum pro/sw h)=n th=s nukto/s. There seems no reason to doubt that the Macedonians were opposite the Athenians on the Greek left (ch. 31. 5), or to disbelieve in the phil-Hellenism of Alexander (cf. v. 22. 1) or in his friendship for Athens (viii. 136. 140 b). Yet this story of his midnight visit is open to suspicion. Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 43) asks how he could have eluded the Persian sentinels, or, if he was believed to be the bearer of dispatches, where was the alleged risk. More serious objections are the improbability of his assertion that supplies were running short, and the falsification of his warning that Mardonius would fight the decisive battle next day. Macan (ii. 373) points out that Alexander has already given one friendly warning to the Greeks (vii. 173), and notes the tendency to justify the conduct of the Macedonian, yet he rightly holds that there was probably some communication and collusion between Alexander and the Athenians (ii. 384). toi=si strathgoi=si.

Twelfth day (46-51). Athenian and Spartan change of positions (46, 47). Challenge of Mardonius (48). The Greeks, harassed by cavalry, resolve to retreat to the Island (49-51). Few critics or historians will now accept this story of marching and countermarching as the literal truth. These manuvres could not be carried out by large bodies of troops in face of the enemy in a single day (Hauvette, p. 469). Such conduct on the part of Spartans is unexampled (Grote), and would surely have demoralized the whole Greek army. The foundation of the story is probably some manuvre whose purpose was misunderstood by H. (Grundy, p. 470), or wilfully misrepresented by his Athenian informants (Woodhouse, J. H. S. xviii. 47, &c.). The simplest hypothesis is that of E. Meyer (iii, p. 40), that the Spartans moved to the left wing because when the Greeks advanced that was the post of danger. Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 159, 160) suggests that the troops marched to the second position by brigades, and that the Spartans, moving first, marched by the Athenians, and then the Athenians in turn pushed on behind this screen of troops and again formed the left wing near the Asopus. It is no doubt literally true that no living Spartan had fought in a pitched battle against the Persians, since Aristodemus, the sole survivor from Thermopylae (ix. 71), took no part in the fighting there (vii. 229); but we can hardly believe that the Spartans, after Thermopylae, feared the Persian\u2014they certainly had more reason to fear Thessalians (v. 63); nor is it true, so far as we know, that they had fought with the Boeotians, whereas the Athenians had defeated them utterly (v. 77). Plutarch treats Pausanias' unwillingness to face the Persians as ridiculous (de Mal. Herod. 42, Mor. 872 B), and (Aristides, ch. 16) makes the Athenians grumble at his orders till reconciled to them by Aristides. The latter variant is evidently designed to glorify Aristides. e)pi\\ tou= eu)wnu/mon (sc.e)poi/ee). Mardonius did likewise on the left wing. The taunt and challenge of Mardonius seem to be reminiscences from Homer (Il. iii. 67 f.; viii. 161 f.). We may, however, compare the combat for Thyrea (i. 82 n.).

Notice that the Spartans are made solely responsible for the loss of the fountain Gargaphia, on which cf. ch. 25 n. Since the successful raid of the Persian cavalry, the Greek transport dare not leave the shelter of the hills. The enemy's horse might at any time sweep down upon them if they attempted to cross the open ground between the pass and the Greek position. At the present day there is no such 'island' as H. describes near Plataea. But the Greeks felt no objection to calling a peninsula an island; cf. Peloponnesus, Chersonesus, &c. Leake and Vischer identified as 'the island' a level stretch of meadow land intersected by several streams, which later unite to form the Oeroe. Grundy (p. 481 f.) objects that in September, when the battle was fought, these streams would be dry before they reached this part of the plain, and that their beds offer no obstacle to cavalry. Further, in order to reach this supposed refuge from the cavalry, the Greek army, already shaken, would have had to cross a mile of open country exposed to its attacks. Finally, this tongue of land is surrounded by good cavalry ground, so that in case of defeat, the Greek army would have been in a hopeless position. Grundy, therefore, rightly prefers (p. 484 f.) the ridge or ridges at the foot of Cithaeron between the upper courses of the same streams, because this position is almost unassailable by cavalry, and lies (pro\\ th=s *plataie/wn po/lios) east of Plataea, the side towards which the city looks, and from which it is naturally approached. The only difficulty is the statement that it is ten stades from the Asopus. If we reject Grundy's use of the name for the tributary stream from Apotripi (ch. 31. 1 n.), we must either with Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 57) insert k/ = 20 after *)aswpou= before kai/, or with Munro hold that the sentence means, 'the island is distant from the Asopus, or rather from Gargaphia, at which they were then encamped, ten stades'; cf. J. H. S. xxiv. 161. sxizo/menos [o(] potamo/s. Since the river referred to must be the Oeroe, the article is better away. There is now no trace of such a division of the stream. The Oeroe is a small and sluggish stream, formed of brooks from Mount Cithaeron and flowing west to Creusis. o(/son per, 'as much as' (cf. ii. 170. 2; is more Herodotean. w(/sper katiqu\\ e)o/ntwn, 'as they did when they were directly exposed to them.' The remark would apply specially to the Athenians who had advanced furthest on to the plain. H. speaks as if the whole force was first to take position on the island behind the Oeroe, and then the right wing was to move sideways along the hills to the pass or passes over Cithaeron. It is, however, far more likely that only a part of the army was intended to occupy the island, probably only the Athenians, while the Spartans themselves undertook the difficult operation of relieving the provision trains blocked in the passes, and thus reopening the communications of the Greek army (Grundy, p. 492; Woodhouse, p. 53). They would also permanently secure the passes for the future. Night of the twelfth day. Flight of the Greek centre (52). Retreat of Pausanias and of the Athenians delayed by the obstinacy of Amompharetus (53-7). H. evidently believed that the Greek centre, including all the troops from the Corinthians to the Megarians (cf. ch. 28 and 69), fled in a panic. But, if so, it is not easy to see why they halted and piled arms before Plataea, instead of making directly for the PlataeaMegara pass (Grundy, p. 490). Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii, p. 50 f.), followed by Munro and Macan (ii. 382), suggests that the centre really occupied its intended position. Hence it was readily reached by a messenger from Pausanias (ch. 69), and then, in accordance with its orders, split up into two brigades. po/lin. Plataea had been burnt by the Persians (viii. 50), but no doubt parts of its walls still were standing, and would cover the left flank of the Greek position. *(/hraion. Probably on the site of the large temple found by the American excavators. It lies east of the fortified north-west corner of the town, identified by Grundy as fifth-century Plataea, and yet within the larger later city, as is implied by Pausanias (ix. 2. 7, with Frazer ad loc.). It is eighteen stades from Grundy's Gargaphia and fifteen from Apotripi. It is natural to suppose that the largest temple at Plataea was dedicated to its chief goddess, Hera Teleia (cf. Paus ix. 2. 7 f.). According to Plutarch (Aristides, ch. 11 and 18), Hera was called also Hera Kithaironeia. The story of Amompharetus reads like a camp tale. It is no doubt a fact that he remained behind with a detachment; it is very possible that in a council of war he opposed the plan of retreat. But the whole scene here described is opposed to the high repute of Spartan discipline, and the maxim that it is a disgrace to retreat before the enemy is as mythical as 'the Guard dies but never surrenders'. Probably he was left behind with a rear-guard to cover the delayed retreat (cf. 57 n.). kata/, 'after them'; cf. i. 84. 5; ii. 70. 2; iii. 4. 2; ix. 59. 1. The expression is loose, but H. clearly believed all the Greek brigades were to converge on 'the island'. The existence of a Pitanate lo/xos is totally denied by Thucydides, i. 20 (cf. vi. 57. 5 n.), who is echoed by Hesychius young Spartans into a lo/xos *pitana/ths, believed himself to be imitating ancient usage (Herodian, iv. 8). There is a good deal of evidence for the view that the earliest lo/xoi at Sparta were local corps, probably five in number (cf. Gilbert, G. C. A. p. and Hesychius, who cites Aristotle as the authority for five lo/xoi. H.'s 5,000 Spartiates (cf. 10. 4) perhaps represents a corps of 1,000 from each Spartan village. We may explain the direct contradiction in Thucydides by supposing that H. has made a mistake as to the name of the lo/xos, since Pitana, though an important suburb (cf. iii. 55. 2), was not, according to the scholiasts, one of the 'quarters' after which the lo/xoi were called, or less probably by the fact that the organization of the Spartan army, which was kept a secret (Thuc. v. 68), had been changed before Thucydides wrote, probably at the time of the Helot revolt (circ. 464 B. C.), so that a denial true for his own day might be false for the time of the Persian war. cei/nous: cf. ch. 11. 2 n. ou) parageno/menos. This looks like a hypothesis invented to explain absence of opposition earlier, but Amompharetus may have been on outpost duty with his regiment. *eu)rua/nac: cf. ch. 10. 3 n., 55. 1. The Spartans and Tegeans formed together the right wing. The excuse put forward by the Athenians to explain their own failure to reach their appointed post on the 'island' does not hold water (Woodhouse, J. H. S. xviii. 52; Macan, ii. 383). Why should Pausanias after ordering a general retreat expose his own division unsupported to Persian attack? Probably in the end he reached, or all but reached, his appointed station (App. XXII. 6; Macan ii. 382). If he delayed to start, it was probably because he intended himself to cover the retreat of the other divisions, and the Athenians, by their own admission, were not yet moving. It is probable enough that already in 479 B. C. there was mistrust of Sparta at Athens, caused by the delay in sending help, and justified perhaps by the jealousy shown in Sparta's attempts to prevent the rebuilding of the walls of Athens (478 B. C.; Thuc. i. 89 f.; cf. App. XXII ad fin.). Yet the phraseology of H. recalls the charges of treachery current at Athens in the Peloponnesian war, satirized by Aristophanes (Acharn. 308; Pax 1067), and reflects Athenian prejudice (cf. viii. 144. 4 n.) of the kind which made Punica fides proverbial at Rome, and perfide Albion in France. ta\\ e)ntetalme/na: the questions he had been ordered to ask; cf. 54. 2. The Athenians were to close up to the Spartans and conform their movements to those of Pausanias. In H.'s opinion the purpose would be to close the gap left by the retreat of the centre, but most probably it was throughout intended that in the new position the Athenians should be next the Spartans and 1; viii. 7. 2, 13. 1. Grundy (p. 504) rightly holds that the Athenians were posted on the Asopus Ridge, and descended its western slope into the plain, thus starting their march in the opposite direction to the Spartans (ta\\ e)/mpalin, cf. vii. 58. 1). Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 54) holds that Amompharetus was left behind with a rear-guard to cover the retreat of the right wing, and perhaps also of the Athenians who were evidently still trailing across the plain at sunrise (Munro, J. H. S. xxiv. 164). He retreated slowly (ba/dhn) only just in front of the Persian cavalry (\u00a7 3). periei/xeto, 'kept on insisting' that they should they were (Macan). i)qe/h| te/xnh|: outright; cf. ch. 37. 4. If Hude is right in adopting the conjecture d/ = 4 for de/ka = 10, there can be little doubt that Grundy's identification of the temple of Eleusinian Demeter (p. 496) with the modern church of St. Demetrius should be accepted, as it is some four and a half stades from his Gargaphia. The church is, however, nearer his stream A 5, with which he at first (1894; cf. Topography of Plataea, p. 33) identified the Moloeis, than the more important stream A 6, which he now (G. P. W. p. 495) prefers. The *)argio/pios xw=ros is unknown. If the MS. reading de/ka be retained (cf. App. XXII. 6), it would seem probable that there is a confusion between two temples. There were at least two temples of Demeter within the field of operations, (1) near Plataea, cf. Paus. ix. 4. 3; (2) near Hysiae, Plut. Aristid. 11. It would seem then that the Demeter temple here, if ten stades from Gargaphia, should be looked for under the rocky foot of Cithaeron, either on some high ground about fifteen stades from Plataea, where now are the foundations of a large Byzantine church (Hauvette, p. 476, cf. Amer. Jour. Arch. vi. 467), or just east of Kriekouki and west of the Eleutherae-Thebes road, where two inscriptions have been found relating to the worship of Demeter (Frazer, Paus. v, p. 5; Munro, J. H. S. xxiv. 163), while that mentioned in ch. 65 would be the modern Demetrion. Grundy, although he retains the ten stades from Gargaphia, is convinced that only one temple is meant throughout, that which is now the church of St. Demetrius. Battle of Plataea. Mardonius attacks the Spartans and Tegeans and is defeated (58-65). e)le/gete. H. does not ascribe such a saying directly to the Aleuadae, though they may be included in the phrase (48. 1) u(po\\ tw=n th=|de a)nqrw/pwn. From a Persian point of view they might be regarded as neighbours of Sparta. For this boast of the Spartans cf. vii. 104. 4, 5, 209, 234; ix. 53. e)napedeiknu/ato. Stein would supply an object (e. g. e)/rga, a)reta/s), but the middle may have the force of 'approved themselves', se ostentabant. For the genitive e)paineo/ntwn after the cf. i. 3. 2; viii. 69. i. sunh|de/ate, 'of whom you knew somewhat'; cf. ch. 60. 3; v. 24. 3; 74. 2. For the facts cf. ch. 41. a)nazeu/cantas: cf. viii. 60. a n. The Athenians having descended into the plain to the west of the Asopus ridge (ch. 56. 2 n.) would be hidden from the enemy by the northern extension of that ridge (Grundy, p. 504 n.). ko/smw|: the discipline and order of the separate corps or regiments. ta/ci: their position and use in the army as a whole (cf. viii. 86 n.). Doubts have been thrown on this message of Pausanias. Its wording has clearly been altered to suit Athenian prejudices, exalting Athens and condemning the other allies. But it is quite natural that Pausanias, who probably thought he was attacked by the whole force of the enemy, should ask for reinforcements from his nearest allies, and especially for archers (\u00a7 3) to help him against the Persian cavalry (cf. ch. 22. 1 n.). de/doktai. There is no need for a new resolution, because their course has already been determined; cf. iv. 68. 4; v. 96. 2; vi. 109. 3; ix. 74. 1. Only one light-armed soldier is reckoned for each Perioecus and Tegeate; cf. ch. 29. 2 n., but there were seven for each Spartiate (ch. 20. 2 n.). ge/rra: light wicker shields (vii. 61. 1; Xen. Anab. i. 8. 9; ii. 1. 6). R\u00fcstow supposes that the Persians fixed them in the ground with the help of their short spears, but, as Stein points out, some more elaborate and effective arrangement seems required. They are described as a considerable obstacle to the Greek hoplites (ch. 62. 2, 102. 2, 3) and a real protection for the Persians (ch. 99. 3). It is only when the Greeks have broken through this shield-wall that the Persians are defenceless. The Heraeum (cf. ch. 52 n.) would be above and behind him, to the left. It is clear that Pausanias showed great tactical skill, and the Spartans their usual courage and discipline in remaining passive under the hail of arrows, till the Persian infantry was thoroughly engaged, so that a battle at close quarters was inevitable. He thus rendered the Persian cavalry practically useless, except in covering the retreat (ch. 68), and might confidently count on the superiority of the Greek hoplite in arms and discipline (62. 3, 63. 2). to\\ *dhmh/trion: cf. ch. 57. 2 n. a)/noploi need only mean 'without shields', though the strong expressions below (63. 2) seem to imply that they were also without cuirass or corselet. This was true of the Bactrians, Indians, and Sacae, but some at least of the Persians and Medes wore cuirasses (viii. 113; vii. 61. 1 n.) quilted with scales of metal. The skill (sofi/h) of the Lacedaemonians may have been shown as at Thermopylae (vii. 211. 3) by a feigned retreat, as is definitely stated in Plato, Laches 191 C. For similar tactics against a shieldwall cf. the Normans at Hastings. xili/ous. The regiment of horse picked in viii. 113. 2. For the oracle cf. viii. 114 n. The genealogical remarks serve to show and enhance the importance of the Greek leader (cf. vii. 186. 2 n.). For Leonidas' genealogy cf. vii. 204. *)arimnh/stou. Plutarch (Aristid. 19) says Arimnestus slew Mardonius by striking him with a stone, but a distinguished Spartiate would be unlikely to use a stone as a weapon. Stenyclarus is the name given to the northern or upper plain of Messenia, divided from the southern by low hills, as well as to the deserted town once the capital of the district. Arimnestus fell in the Helot revolt known as the third Messenian war, probably in its opening engagement (464 B. C.). Macan, reading *)aeimnh/stou, thinks he may have been a Plataean 'well known in Sparta', since Thucydides tells us of a Lacon, son of Aeimnestus at Plataea (iii. 52) and also of a Plataean contingent sent to help Sparta in the Helot revolt (iii. 54). But how came a Plataean to be fighting among the Spartans, and not on the other wing? Cf. however ch. 72. 2 n. tei=xos: cf. ch. 15. 2 n. Grundy (p. 503) holds that this incidental statement strongly supports his view that the temple stood on the site of the church of St. Demetrius (cf. ch. 57. 2 n.), as the barbarians would naturally flee on both sides of the hill on which the sanctuary stood. For this caution in dealing with things divine cf. ii. 3. 2 n. a)na/ktoron. This is the first mention of the destruction of the temple at Eleusis. to\\ i(ro/n is a gloss on a)na/ktoron, the proper term for the cella or shrine containing the statue of the god (Pollux i. 9); cf. Eur. Ion 55, Iph. Taur. 41, 66, &c., and specially used for the sanctuary of Demeter, at Celae (Paus. ii. 14. 4) and 213 D. Possibly the great hall of initiation is meant (Frazer, Paus. ii, p. 510; iii, p. 82). Flight of Artabazus (66). Victory of the Athenians and defeat of the Greek centre (67-9). Storming of the Persian camp (70). Losses on both sides. For Artabazus cf. viii. 126, ix. 41. Munro (J. H. S. xxiv. 165) suggests that when the battle took place he may have been still several marches in rear, and that his absence was later ascribed to prudence. The suggestion though ingenious seems over bold. In viii. 126. 1 Artabazus commands a complete army corps of 60,000: the missing 20,000 must have fallen at Potidaea, or been detached on garrison duty, cf. Appendix XIX. 5. oi( mhdi/zontes tw=n *qhbai/wn. These words seem incidentally to admit that there was a non-Medizing party at Thebes; cf. vii. 222 n. tw=n a)/llwn summa/xwn. This probably refers only to the barbarian allies or subjects, who would naturally follow the Persians like a flock of sheep (ch. 68, 70, 1). We hear only of barbarians fighting and falling in the fort (ch. 70. 4, 71). The thirty myriads (ch. 70. 5) are the barbarian forces, exclusive of the Greek contingents (ch. 32. 2). But as only the Boeotians fought zealously, the other Greeks may have been forgotten by H.; probably they scattered to their homes as quickly as they could. tosau=ta explained by the succeeding participles; cf. v. 16. 3. a)gge/lletai. Woodhouse (J. H. S. xviii. 50, 51) argues that this message was in fact an order from Pausanias, sent to his central division posted in the position they had been instructed to occupy (cf. ch. 52 n.). The right section, headed by the Corinthians, was ordered to join the right wing, the left, including the contingents from Phlius, Megara, and all those posted between them, was to support the left wing. He also ingeniously suggests that the Phliasians and Megarians are named to give us the two extremes of the section (cf. ch. 28 n.). This would imply, however, that the Plataeans were throughout brigaded with the Athenians, which is nowhere stated by H. (cf. however Diod. xi. 32 (i. e. Ephorus). Possibly Corinth, Megara, and Phlius are named simply because they supplied the most considerable contingents to the right and the left centre. th\\n fe/rousan a)/nw: i. e. across the ridges coming down from Cithaeron towards the Asopus. th\\n leiota/thn: across the plain, perhaps along the road from Plataea to Thebes. *)aswpo/dwros: perhaps the same mentioned by Pindar (Isthm. i. 34) as father of a Herodotus, who won a chariot-race at the Isthmia. The Megarians who fell in the Persian war, at Artemisium, Mycale, Salamis, and Plataea, were buried within the city (Paus. i. 43. 3, Frazer, ad loc.) and honoured with sacrifice as heroes. This we learn from the heading to the inscription added by the highpriest Helladios, who (circ. A. D. 300) restored the epigram over them, attributed by him to Simonides, their courage in facing cavalry at Plataea may well be a later addition: in any case conventional praise of the dead cannot outweigh H.'s distinct statement of their rout (but see Appendix XXII. 1, 6, 7). e)n ou)deni\\ lo/gw|, 'perished unheeded'; cf. iv. 135. 1; vii. 223. 2 H. accordingly refuses to count them among those who fell in the battle. teixomaxe/ein. Spartan inefficiency in siege operations is borne out by the facts that they were obliged to blockade Ithome (Thuc. i. 104 and Plataea (Thuc. ii. 75-8), and that they fail to take even the hasty and incomplete fortifications at Pylus (Thuc. iv. 4, 5, and 11, 12). Whether Athenian skill in siege work, such as it was, was developed so early as this has been doubted; cf. however Thuc. i. 102. Hauvette (p. 481) sees in the Athenians the sappers, in the Tegeans the scaling party, of the Greeks. Delbr\u00fcck (Perserkriege, p. 112) and Busolt (ii. 737 n.) suggest H. has put together without reconciling two local traditions. skhnh/n. This tent of Mardonius is probably that left by Xerxes (cf. ix. 82). The Odeum of Pericles is said to have been built in imitation of it (Plut. Pericles 13; Paus. i. 20. 4, Frazer). i. 66. 4 n. a)lukte/w. Perhaps the Greeks spared only 3,000 of those who took refuge in the fort; but doubtless many barbarians, besides the corps of Artabazus, fled elsewhere. Diodorus (xi. 32) estimates the Persian loss at Plataea at more than 100,000, Ctesias (Persica, ch. 26, p. 70) the whole loss after Salamis at 120,000, but these numbers deserve no credit. The massacre was, however, great and indiscriminate; numbers of the Greeks slain are incredibly small, even if it be granted that H. gives only those who fell in the actual battle, disregarding previous operations. He certainly omits the Megarians and Phliasians, and probably the Perioeci and all light-armed troops. Even so the numbers are inconsistent with the many Spartans who fell (61. 3, 63. 1), and the long struggle between the Spartans and Persians (62. 2) and between the Athenians and Boeotians (67. 1). Probably H. misunderstood the inscriptions on the monuments erected over the fallen (ch. 85). If the fifty-two Athenians all belonged to the tribe Aeantis (Clidemus ap. Plut. Arist. 19; F. H. G. i. 362), H.'s error in their case may have consisted in mistaking the stele of a single tribe (cf. Hicks 26) for the full muster-roll of the Athenian dead. Plutarch (l. c.) reckons the Greek dead at 1,360, a small but possible total. Individual feats of valour. This vague expression of opinion as to the superiority of the Spartans in valour becomes in Diodorus (xi. 33, i. e. Ephorus) a definite award of the prize to the Spartans and Pausanias from favouritism. Plutarch (Arist. 20; de Malig. Herod. 42, Mor. 873 A) speaks of a bitter rivalry between Spartans and Athenians as to the Aristeia and setting up the Trophy, happily settled by the mediation of Aristides and by the ingenious suggestion of the Corinthian Cleocritus, to award the prize to the Plataeans. But this story seems due to the late and untrustworthy Idomeneus. It was clearly unknown to H., and Thucydides would surely have made some allusion to it in the speech of the Plataeans to their Spartan judges (iii. 53-9), had he ever heard of it. For Aristodemus and his dishonour cf. vii. 229-31. The order in which the names are given is clearly that of merit, hence below only Posidonius is compared with Aristodemus. *spartih=tai. The MSS. *spartih/ths is impossible, as it would imply that the other two were Perioeci. ti/mioi: probably besides a public funeral and monument, 'heroic honours,' i. e. offerings to the dead; cf. tima=n, i. 30. 5; v. 67. 4. For these cf. v. 47. 2 n.; ix. 69. 2 n. Imitated from Il. 2 n. kath/menos might only mean 'stationary', but it seems to have been quite usual to sit down in the ranks; cf. Eurip. Suppl. 357, commanded the Plataean contingent, and Pausanias (ix. 4. 2) says that he did so at Marathon also, and that his statue was set up in the temple of Athenea Areia built with Persian spoils. But it is not easy to see how the Plataean commander (or indeed any Plataean) could have been in the Spartan ranks, since their station was on the left wing with the Athenians (ch. 28; Plut. Lacon, Spartan Proxenus at Plataea, and so the name is given in some MSS. here; cf. c. 64. 2 n. *dekele/wn repeats and emphasizes *dekeleh=qen; cf. ix. 92 a)ndro\\s *)apollwnih/tew, *)apollwni/hs de/, vii. 80. For Decelea cf. c. 15. 1 n. The old Attic myth is but loosely connected with the anecdotes of Sophanes; cf. vi. 121. It is probably a temple legend serving to explain the worship of the Dioscuri in Athens (as Anakes in the Anakeion, near the precinct of Aglauros; cf. viii. 53. 1 n.). It is given in fuller if later forms by Plutarch (Theseus, 31 f.), Diodorus (iv. 63), Pausanias (i. 17. 5), and was treated by the poets Alcman (Paus. i. 41. 4), Stesichorus (Paus. ii. 22. 6), Pindar (Paus. i. 41. 5), and on the chest of Cypselus (Paus. v. 19. 3; Dio Chrys., p. 163). Theseus, with his comrade Peirithous, seized the girl Helen as she was dancing at the feast of Artemis Orthia, and placed her under the care of his mother Aethra in the hill-fort of Aphidna. Whilst he was away, having gone with Peirithous to carry off Persephone, the Dioscuri came to Attica to rescue their sister. *dekelo/s, eponymous hero of Decelea, may have had treachery imputed to him on account of his name (deiknu/nai); the insolence (u(/bris) of Theseus consisted in his deposition of the local princes and unification of Attica under one ruler (Plut. loc. cit.). The later versions (cf. Plut. l. c.), which made the Dioscuri besiege Athens itself (following Alcman), substitute Academus for Decelus, and the Academy as the spot spared by the Spartans. *)afi/dnas (*)afi/dna), one of the twelve Cecropian townships (Strabo 396), a deme of the tribe Acantis, is probably the ruined fortress on the isolated hill Kotroni, six miles east of Decelea (Frazer, Paus. ii. 163). *titako/s: eponymous hero of the deme *titaki/dai, not far from Aphidna; like all the deme heroes he is regarded as autochthonous. proedri/h: seats of honour at public games, and a)telei/h, exemption from the tax on foreigners, were often granted as marks of honour to benefactors; cf. i. 54. 2; Hicks 89, 126, 134, 165. Here they are regarded as such distinctive marks of friendship that H. rather ungrammatically attaches to them the crowning proof of Sparta's favour, abstention from wasting the land of Decelea in the Peloponnesian war. e)s to\\n po/lemon. H. elsewhere (vii. 137. 1) refers in similar terms to the Peloponnesian war, implying it was going on while he was writing. The sparing of Decelea no doubt refers to the five early invasions (431-425 B. C.); in 431 at least Archidamus wasted the country surrounding it; cf. Thuc. ii. 23. H. did not live to see Decelea occupied by Agis (413 B. C.); cf. f. dicou/s: 'the two stories told' had their origin in Scolia (drinking songs) in honour of the famous warrior. e)de/dokto: instituerat; 'it was his wont to'; cf. ch. 60. 2 n. Before a)/gkuran most editors with some MSS. read e)pi/shmon 'as a device on his shield', and some such word is required. For such devices cf. i. 171. 4; Aesch. Sept. c. Thebas 375-652; Eur. Phoen. 1107-38. For Eurybates, his exploits and death, cf. vi. 92 n., and for the Pentathlon ix. 33. 2 n. Leagrus belonged to a good family. His son Glaucus commanded the reinforcements sent to Corcyra 433 B. C. (Thuc. i. 51; Hicks 53), and had been general in 440 B. C. (Busolt, iii. 199 n.), and his granddaughter was wife of Callias da|dou=xos (Andoc. Myst. 117). *da/tw|. *da/tos or *da/ton was apparently a name given originally to the whole district east of Mount Pangaeum and west of the Nestus, from the mountains north of Philippi to the sea. It was fertile, well timbered, and rich in gold mines (Strabo 331, fr. 34, 36). The name is so used here and in Isocrates, de Pace 86. The people are called *dath/noi (Harpocration). The town *da/ton was not founded by the Thasians till about 360 B. C. (Diodorus xvi. 3. 7; Ps.-Scylax 68), probably on the site of the older mining settlement Crenides, called afterwards Philippi (Appian, B. C. iv. 105; Ephorus and Philochorus ap. Harpocr., cf. Busolt, iii. 197, n. 5 and Pauly-Wissowa), though Kiepert and others place it on the coast near Neapolis; cf. Strabo l. c.; Plin. iv. 42. Thucydides twice tells us (i. 100; iv. 102 that the Athenian colonists were destroyed at Drabescus (cf. Diod. xi. 70<//bibl>, xii. 60; Paus. i. 29. 4), probably the modern Drama, ten miles north-west of Philippi at the end of the plain (Busolt, iii. 203 n.). The disaster is dated by Thucydides thirty-two years after the death of Aristagoras (498-497 B. C.) and twenty-nine before the foundation of Amphipolis (cf. Diodorus xii. 32), i. e. 465 B. C. The attempted settlement is connected with Cimon's expedition against Thasos, which had revolted owing to disputes with Athens about its mines and possessions on the opposite coast (Thuc. i. 100, 101); cf. Busolt, iii. 198 f. Stories of Pausanias, the lady of Cos, and Lampon of Aegina. Mantineans and Eleans too late for the battle. *faranda/teos: cf. vii. 79. He was a nephew of Darius. kosmhsame/nh.

R. xvii. 99-101) has ingeniously argued that this speech is a transcript from an inscription, explaining a picture or bas-relief dedicated by the lady and representing her as a suppliant before the 'king', with Persian corpses (one named *faranda/ths *tea/spios) on the ground, and two maids on the one side balancing two ephors on the other. The inscription would the generic daimo/nwn for h(rw/wn (cf. viii. 109. 3 n.) and disguised the verse by writing ai)xmalw/tou for dorilh/ptou, though even so the expression remains poetical; cf. viii. 114. 2 n. H.'s interest in this lady of Cos may be explained by the close connexion between Cos and Halicarnassus (vii. 163 n.); both were under Artemisia (vii. 99). basileu=. Pausanias, though only regent (ch. 10), might well be addressed as king (cf. vii. 161 n.). For Pausanias cf. v. 32 n. In Xenophon's time at least the king was regularly accompanied by two ephors on all European expeditions (Xen. Rep. Lac. xiii. 5; Hell. ii. 4. 36), and it may be that this custom is as old as the time of the Persian war. Yet Pleistoanax (445 B. C.) is accompanied to Attica not by Ephors but by a number of councillors, the chief of whom is appointed by the Ephors (Plut. Per. 22), and Agis after his failure by ten councillors (Thuc. v. 63, 418 B. C.). The apparent freedom from any control enjoyed by Pausanias and Leotychides, as well as by Archidamus at the beginning and Agis at the end of the Peloponnesian War (Thuc. viii. 5) is also remarkable. We must either suppose that the Ephors, though present, did not interfere with the king, but only reported on his conduct, or that the custom is later and the presence of Ephors on this occasion accidental. au)ti/ka meta\\ tau=ta. H. uses a standing formula (viii. 108. 1; ix. 93. 3 n.) intended to emphasize the fact that the Mantineans and Eleans arrived from the Peloponnese just too late when all was over (e)p' e)cergasme/noisi, cf. iv. 164. 3; viii. 94. 4). Probably the two states were infected with Medism, and waited for the issue of the battle of Plataea before joining the victors. The banishment of the generals perhaps indicates a democratic revolution against a ruling oligarchy (cf. ch. 10 n. and Munro, J. H. S. xxiv. 148). a)/cioi zhmiw=sai, 'deserved that men should punish them'; cf. iv. 42. 1. tou\\s *mh/dous: generic; Persians, not the special people, the Medes. e)di/wkon, 'were minded to pursue'; but e)di/wcan (2, 3; cf. i. 68. 5), 'banished.' The Eleans, however, though not the Mantineans, who had been at Thermopylae (vii. 202), contrived to have their name inserted in the inscriptions on the national memorials (ch. 81 n.), not only at Olympia but at Delphi. Possibly they owed this to Spartan favour, since it appears that the Spartans were responsible for the list of names on the Delphic memorial (Thuc. i. 132), and both the dialect and lettering of that inscription are Laconian. *la/mpwn o( *puqe/w. Pytheas, father of Lampon, is not likely to be the heroic son of Ischenous, captured at Sciathus and released at Salamis (vii. 181; viii. 92). It is, however, tempting to identify Lampon with the father of the Pytheas, whose victory as a youth at Nemea (before 480 B. C.) was celebrated both by Pindar (Nem. v.) and by Bacchylides (Ode xiii), while those of his brother Phylacidas at the Isthmus (480, 478 B. C.) were sung by Pindar (Isthm. iv and v). The objection is that Pindar (Isthm. v. 16) speaks of Lampon as son of Cleonicus, but Cleonicus may be a remoter ancestor (cf. Isthm. iv. 55) or a title given to Pytheas from the numerous athletic victories of the family (Isthm. iv. 17 f.; v. 60 f.). Lampon belonged to the great house of the Psalychidae (Isthm. v. 63) and was famous for hospitality (Isthm. v. 70; Bacch. xiii. 191). If the Lampon here mentioned be not Pindar's friend, he must have been a contemporary and relative. For ta\\ prw=ta cf. vi. 100. 3 n. The tale here told of Lampon illustrates two tendencies in H. or his sources: (1) a prejudice against the Aeginetans (v. 81 n.), to whom Athenian opinion was most hostile when H. wrote (cf. ch. 80. 3, 85. 3; vi. 87, 91 nn.); (2) a wish to contrast Greek and barbarian (cf. ch. 82; vii. 134 f.). For the fate of Leonidas' corpse cf. vii. 238 n. Mardonius seems to have been brought in by the apocryphal story in viii. 114. The booty. The dedicatory offerings. The tombs at Plataea. For the gold cups and vessels cf. vii. 119. 2, 190. The Persians, especially the guard of 'Immortals', were splendidly attired (vii. 83; viii. 113). tou\\s a)kina/kas. The article is inserted (cf. iii. 118. 2; ix. 107. 2) because the acinaces (vii. 54. 2 n.) was well known to be a Persian weapon. The Swiss, after the defeat of Charles the Bold at Granson (A. D. 1476), are said to have been equally ignorant. (P. de Commines, M\u00e9moires, v. 2) 'Il y en eut qui vendirent quantit\u00e9 de plats fut d'estaing'. The point of the story, 'and that is the way the Aeginetans first grew rich,' reveals its character as a malicious Attic witticism, invented in days when Aegina's commercial greatness had been so completely eclipsed by the new power of Athens that the distant and profitable voyages of the earlier Aeginetan traders (ii. 178. 3; iv. 152. 3; vii. 147. 2) had been forgotten. The famous golden tripod at Delphi and the statues at Olympia (and at the Isthmus) were dedicated from the spoil won at Plataea, and hence were regarded by Pausanias (v. 23. 1; x. 13. 9) as trophies of that victory alone. But the words which head the list of states inscribed on the bronze triple serpent supporting the tripod. [*t]o[i/de to\\n] po/lemon [e)]pol[e/]meon, as well to\\n ba/rbaron e)/sthsan to\\ a)na/qhma, show that it was regarded as a memorial of the whole war (cf. the inclusion of states which fought at Salamis only, viii. 82. 1 n.). Either on the stone pedestal of the column or, less probably, on the thirteenth coil of the serpent, which has been flattened to receive the words given above, Pausanias had originally in koinh/ and in the third person by Thuc. i. 132, &c.). Probably the place of this erased inscription was taken by the couplet quoted by Diodorus (xi. the three feet of the tripod rested on the three serpents' heads, though there is no mark of a join on the top of the one still extant. It is less likely that the feet of the tripod rested on the stone base, and that the serpent column was merely the central prop of the golden cauldron supported by the tripod. In the sacred war (355 B. C.) the Phocians stole the golden part of the monument but left the bronze (Paus. x. 13. 9). Constantine carried off the serpent column and placed it in the Hippodrome (Atmeidan) at Constantinople, where it still remains. It was apparently converted into a three-mouthed fountain by a later emperor. It was seen and described by travellers from 1422 on, but in 1700 was thrown down and the serpents' heads were broken off. The base of the column was excavated by Sir C. T. Newton (1855) and the inscription published in 1856 by O. Frick and Dethier; a revised version is due to Fabricius (1886). Of the twenty-nine serpent coils fifteen had been underground, the inscription beginning on the thirteenth coil and ending on the third; the twelfth and thirteenth coils have been scarred and dented with sabre cuts, so the inscription is hardly legible. The list of states on the serpent column should be compared with that on the trophy at Olympia and with those given by H. of the Greeks who fought at Plataea and Salamis, as is done on the opposite page. It will be noticed that five names found in H. are not given on the Delphic inscription, and that four more are omitted by Pausanias. Prof. A. Bauer (Wiener Studien, 1887, p. 223 f.) would explain the omissions by the suggestion that the right to have names inscribed on a monument was earned not by fighting but by contributing to the cost of the monument. But this view is contradicted by the heading of the Delphic inscription (sup.) and by the words of Thucydides (i. 132 sup.), as well as by H.'s statement. It is far more likely that states whose contingents were very small were left out, unless, like the Tenians, they rendered signal service (cf. viii. 82). Indeed, it would appear from the fact that the names N.B.\u2014Those italicized in list 3 do not appear on either inscription; those in list 1 are not found in list 2. * indicates a marked difference in order from list 1. of the Tenians and Siphnians are written irregularly, and in each case make a fourth name on the coil, three being the usual number, that these states were inserted later. The thirty-one names on the Delphic tripod is the precise number given by Plutarch (Them. 20) as fighting against Persia. Whether the four omissions in Pausanias are due to faulty copying of the inscription at Olympia, or whether here, too, the comparative insignificance of the contingents caused the omissions, must remain doubtful. Domaszewski's explanation (Neue Heidelberger Jahrb\u00fccher, i. 181-7) of the arrangement as three groups, (1) Tegea to Tiryns, Peloponnesian allies (Spartan); allies; (3) Potidaea to Ambracia, Corinthian colonies, is untenable, as neither Mycenaeans, Chalcidians, nor Eleans are specially Athenian allies, and the order is different at Olympia. In both lists the compilers seem to have been guided at once by the importance and services of the states, and by geographical considerations, but they applied the principles rather differently. Tegea, for instance, is put specially high on the Delphic list because of the bravery of her hoplites at Plataea (cf. ix. 61, 62, and 70; cf. also ix. 26); cf. in general Frazer on Paus. ix. 13. 9; R\u00f6hl, I. G. A. 70 (with a picture); Hicks, 19. tou= bwmou=. Cf. ii. 135. 4 n. On the level space near it, northeast of the temple just above the Sacred Way, stands a huge base with two pedestals, one recording the dedication of a tripod and a Victory by Gelo, in commemoration of the battle of the Himera (Diod. xi. 26), the other probably dedicated by Hiero (Jebb, Bacchyl. p. 452 f.). Just above this stands the base on which the Plataean trophy is believed to have rested. tw=| e)n *)isqmw=|. Poseidon (cf. viii. 121. 1 n.). Probably there was a list of names on this offering too. kai\\ tou/toisi: as well as to Pausanias. pa/nta de/ka: tenfold, almost proverbial; cf. iv. 88. 1. This contrast (cf. ch. 78 n.) between Persian luxury and Spartan hardiness is rather strangely assigned to Pausanias, who himself within a year or two fell into the luxurious and despotic habits of an Eastern Sultan (Thuc. i. 130). For a similar story cf. i. 71. e)fa/nhktl.: ch. 83. 2 and 84 as well as this sentence are rejected by Kr\u00fcger and Gomperz as containing a collection of disconnected notices here out of place, and also because of some strange or corrupt words and phrases, e. refuge in his usual theory of notes incorporated in a second edition, a suggestion more applicable to ch. 81, 82, since the words u(ste/rw| me/ntoi xro/nw| and kai\\ tw=n *plataie/wn suxnoi/ have no point unless the sentence follows immediately on the end of ch. 80, the contrast being with the Helots and Aeginetans. The notice may be modelled on iii. 12. Albrecht Achilles, Margrave of Brandenburg 1486 A. D., had a skull without a suture (B\u00e4hr), Pyrrhus, and a son of Prusias of Bithynia, an upper jaw with the teeth all of a piece (Plut. Pyr. 3; Plin. vii. 69). The connexion is defective and the words e)pei/te de/ meaningless. Stein suggests e)pei/ ge dh/ on the assumption that the gigantic skeleton was that of Mardonius. This can hardly be true, for there is nowhere a suggestion that Mardonius was a giant, though no doubt other Persian leaders are big men (vii. 117. 1, 187. 2; ix. 25. 1, 96. 2). Pausanias, who repeats this story (ix. 2. 2), saw a grave of Mardonius to the right of the road from Eleutherae to Plataea near the battle-field. h)/dh h)/kousa: cf. iv. tinas: very intensive, cf. 2. pantodapou/s, 'of all nations.' Pausanias (l. c.) makes all the successful claimants 'Ionian'. toiou/tw|: i. e. secretly, if the reading is sound. The opening sentence is clearly connected with the end of chapter 81. e)/qapton xwri\\s e(/kastoi. Pausanias believed there were only three tombs had disappeared from neglect. i)re/nas. Iren is the term for a young Spartan between twenty and thirty years of age. These youths had no part in the meetings of the assembly and no right to a household of their own, but they were free from the discipline of the boys, and were indeed expected to inspire them by precept and example. They were also largely employed on military service. But it is impossible that all the Spartiates who won the highest distinction at Plataea were irens, and in particular that Amompharetus, colonel of his regiment, with a voice in the council of war (ch. 53, 55), should be so young a man. (This has led Blakesley to suspect the clause e)/nqa 11. 3) are left out in H.'s scheme. It seems more likely that the first tomb contained all the Spartiates (the majority of whom may have been irens; cf. ch. 12. 2), the second the Perioeci, and the third the Helots. *)aqhnai=oi: so too Pausanias (l. c.). Thucydides (ii. 34) says that those who fell in war, except at Marathon, were buried at Athens, but it is a mistake to regard this as a deliberate contradiction. Marathon was the only purely Athenian battle-field on which the victors were buried, but Plataea was a Pan-Hellenic triumph. The particular fact that the Aeginetan tomb was erected ten years after the battle by Cleades, their proxenus (viii. 136. 1 n.) at Plataea, is no doubt true enough, but the inference drawn by H. is unfair. It is probable enough that there were many cenotaphs erected later. Only where the dead fell thick and fast in a single spot, as in the case of the states previously named (\u00a7 2), could their bones be gathered for burial. Those who fell in the earlier fighting, or even in the skirmishing of the day just before (ch. 49, 52) the battle, would be scattered over a wide area. In such cases it was customary to set up a cenotaph in memory of the dead; there would be no attempt at deception. The siege, surrender, and fate of the Thebans. The retreat of Artabazus. For Timagenidas cf. ch. 38, Attaginus, ch. 15. The constitution of Thebes is described by a Theban orator (Thuc. iii. 62) as having been at this time a a)naplh/sh|, 'let not the land of Boeotia suffer any more for us'. For the expression implying evil cf. v. 4. 2, vi. 12. 3; for such negative exhortations cf. Goodwin, \u00a7 tw=| koinw=|, 'with the assent of the whole state' (v. 109. 3; viii. 135. 2 n.). H. insists that the whole Theban state Medized eagerly (cf. introduction, p. 40), but apparently there were two parties there (cf. Thuc. iii. 62 the commons of Medism. kai/: the penalty must be paid by the state since the offence, Medism, was also general. tou\\s de\\ a)/llous is assimilated to case of the relative (tou\\s . . . e)ce/dosan); cf. supplied (B\u00e4hr). a)ntilogi/hs: causae dictio, both of the prosecution (87. 2) and of the defence. This expectation of a trial is interesting; it may be compared with the case of the Plataeans in the Peloponnesian war (iii. 52-68). Pausanias, when in his turn accused of Medism, hoped to escape by bribery (Thuc. i. 131); indeed the corruptibility of the Spartans was notorious (cf. vi. 72 n.); nor were the other Greeks much better (Thuc. viii. 45). Blakesley makes the unlikely suggestion that Pausanias was already Medizing, and so was glad to put Timagenidas out of the way lest he should disclose his treachery, while he spared the children of Attaginus to conciliate their father, who was still at large. But H. takes a simpler and more generous view of his action, nor does even Thucydides (i. 128 f.) hint that his treachery began before the fall of Byzantium, 478 B. C. Pausanias let the innocent go free, but foresaw and defeated the devices of Timagenidas and his friends. *ko/rinqon: strictly to the Isthmus where the council of allies met; cf. vii. 172. 1, 173. 4, 175. 1, 195. Macan suggests that this taking to Corinth means that the prisoners were duly tried (presumably by the Council), and that Pausanias merely executed the sentence of the Court. The representation of his action as arbitrary and autocratic may come from a hostile tradition current after his fall. *)arta/bazos feu/gwn: through Phocis (cf. \u00a7 2, c. 66. 3) to Thessaly. It is difficult to believe that Artabazus arrived in Thessaly before the Thessalian cavalry reached home, and before any rumour of the defeat at Plataea had spread there. Again, in his speech to the Thessalians, he is absurdly vague and fails to lie with circumstance. th\\n meso/gaian: taking the straight way across the land (vii. 124 n.), e. g. from Therma to Perdiccas of Macedon, who did not come to the throne till 454 B. C. Possibly Alexander of Macedon may have turned against the beaten Persians. e)k *buzanti/ou. Why Artabazus did not cross the Hellespont at Sestos is not made clear. If the Greek fleet was already besieging Sestos (ch. 114), it is curious that he should have made no effort to save it, though such timidity is in harmony with the caution ascribed to him by H. The sequel of Plataea and that of Mycale are to H. two quite independent stories. (See note, p. 417.) Samian envoys reach the Greek fleet at Delos. Story of Euenius. to\\ trw=ma: as in vi. 132. 1. H. does not explicitly say the disaster was Persian. kate/ato, 'lay inactive'. The story is resumed from viii. 132. The Persian fleet had been 'stationed' (kath/menoi, viii. 130. 2) at Samos, and an embassy from Chios had already asked for help from the Greeks (viii. 132). For Theomestor cf. viii. 85. 2 n. a)/grhn, 'they would never make such a catch again.' The Persian fleet, if surprised by an attacking force from the sea, supported by a revolt in the island, might be captured or destroyed at a blow. This disparagement of the barbarian fleet comes from interested Ionians. It is in contrast with the view of Themistocles (viii. 60 a n.); but that was before Salamis, this after. klhdo/nos: cf. ch. 101. 3 n. kata\\ poieu=ntos, 'by chance 74. 1), through God's doing'; equivalent to qei/h| tu/xh| (iii. 139. 3). For the play on the name cf. vi. 50. 3 n.; Aesch. Ag. 689. For names as omens cf. vii. 180 n. Stein would bracket the clause meta\\ sfe/wn . . . a)popleu/seai (91. 2). It may, however, be an intentional correction of that statement, Leotychides having after all decided to keep Hegesistratus with his own fleet (meta\\ sfe/wn) and send on = e)w\\n e)c *)apollwni/hs; cf. ch. 73. 1 n. The addition is necessary to distinguish this Apollonia from that on the Euxine (iv. 90, 93) and from some twenty other less distinguished towns (Steph. Byz.). It was a colony of the Corinthians (Thuc. i. 26) founded in the days of Periander (Plutarch, 552 F). The Corcyraeans forced their way in here as in other Corinthian colonies, and claimed credit as joint or sole founders (Strabo 316; Scymn. Chius 440; Paus. v. 22. 4). It lay ten stades from the river Aous and sixty from the sea (Strabo l. c.). As one of the termini of the Egnatian Way it became very important in Roman days, and also had a reputation as a place of education (Suet. Vit. Aug. 8). i(ra\\ h(li/ou pro/bata: doubtless sheep (\u00a7 2), 350 or 360 in number, to correspond with the days of the year; so Homer speaking of potamo/n: apparently the Aous, which rises in Mount Lacmon, the central part of Pindus (Strabo 271), and flows by Apollonia though nowhere near Oricum. Possibly H. has confused this 'river' with the little stream which enters the sea at Oricum. ge/nei+ dokimw/tatoi: cf. Ar. the original settlers was a necessary qualification for citizenship; cf. iv. 161. 3 n. We may compare the feeling of the Boers towards the Uitlanders in the Transvaal. For such visitations cf. vi. 139. 2 n. pro/fanta: cf. v. 63. 2 n. = xrhsth/ria (94. 1) and qeopro/pia (94. 3). tou\\s profh/tas ignores the custom at Delphi (viii. 36. 2 ad fin.), where there was but one profh/ths, and at Dodona (ii. 55. 1), where there were priestesses. It is a scholiast's attempt to explain au)toi/ (inf.), which plainly refers to the gods consulted, Zeus and Apollo, who speak in person; cf. i. 47. 3; vii. 141. 3. The cause of Euenius' anger is explained by the words w(s e)capathqei/s; had he known the whole state of the case, he would have asked for more. e)/mfuton mantikh/n. This is the promised gift of the gods (93. 4 ad fin.). Euenius was the inspired seer like Calchas (Il. i. 72) or Iamus (Pind. Ol. vi. 65), not the learned interpreter. For the contrast cf. Cicero, Div. i. 18, quoted vii. 6. 3 n. a)go/ntwn *korinqi/wn: cf. ch. 36, and for the connexion with Corinth ch. 92. 2 n. h)/dh h)/kousa gives a variant discredited by the author; cf. iv. 77. 1; vii. 35. 1, 53. 3. e)pibateu/wn, 'relying on'; cf. iii. 63. 3, 67. 2; vi. 65. 4. e)cela/mbane is correlative to e)kdi/donai, and the whole expression recalls e)rgola/bos, and implies one who works for hire as a daylabourer; cf. Hom. Od. xvii. 383. Such soothsaying for hire was viewed with contempt. For e)pi\\ th\\n *(ella/da, round about all Hellas, cf. Od. a)/stea dinhqh=nai. Battle of Mycale. 97-9 Advance and landing of the Greeks. 100-5 The battle. 106, 7 The Greeks return to Samos to hold council. The Persian leaders quarrel at Sardis. *kala/moisi: Alexis of Samos (ap. Athen. 572 f.; F. H. G. iv. 299) mentions a temple of Aphrodite e)n kala/mois, which might well be the marshy ground near the mouth of the Imbrasus, between the Heraeum and the city of Samos. Perhaps the phrase to\\ *(/hraion to\\ tau/th| is meant to indicate this position outside Samos; in any case the great Heraeum is meant, as is shown by H.'s usage elsewhere (i. 70. 3; iii. 123. 1; iv. 88. 1, 152. 4), and by the fact that no other Heraeum near Samos is known. The Greek fleet would naturally take post on the east side of the island near the town of Samos and opposite Mycale, as the Persian had done before. a)nh=gon: put out to sea across the narrow strait dividing Samos from Mycale (cf. i. 148. 1). pro\\s th\\n h)/peiron gives the result of their action, viz. to reach the mainland. a)ph=kan a)pople/ein. Probably H. is right in holding that after Salamis the Persians dare not face the Greeks at sea, particularly as the Ionians were untrustworthy (Meyer, iii, \u00a7 238), and so sent the Phoenician ships home to secure their safety. Delbr\u00fcck (Perserkriege, p. 104) strangely ascribes their departure to over-confidence caused by the long inaction of the Greek fleet, while Domaszewski (Neue Heidelberger Jahrb\u00fccher, i. 188) suggests that they may have been sent to guard the coast of Thrace. Whether H. is right in postponing the departure of the Phoenicians till the Greeks reached Samos, or at least were sailing from Delos, is more doubtful (Stein). Diodorus (xi. 19; cf. viii. 130 n.) seems to mean that they sailed straight home from Salamis; at latest they must have gone at the first news of the Greek advance. kataleleimme/nos tou= a)/llou stratou=: left behind by the rest of the army, either when it marched on Greece, or when it was disbanded after its return. Kr\u00fcger regards stratou= as a partitive genitive (cf. vii. 170. 3 n.), since the construction is used elsewhere with the simple verb (vii. 168. 4; viii. 113. 2; ix. 19. 1). e)/ruma: cf. ch. 15. 2 n. *po/tnia in the singular is applied to any goddess just as a)/nac is to any god; but the plural po/tniai is used only of the Eumenides (Aesch. Sept. c. Theb. 887; Eum. 951; Soph. Oed. Col. 84), or as Kore (Oed. Col. 1050; Arist. Thesm. 1149; Paus. Besides the temple of Demeter on Mycale (ch. 101. 1) there was one at Priene, recently excavated by Wiegand (Priene, p. 147 f.), at which the goddesses were called qesmo/foroi a(gnai\\ po/tniai (Boeckh, C. I. G. ii. 2907). For Thesmophoria near Ephesus cf. vi. 16. *gai/swn or *gai=sos is probably the brook running by Domatia south of Mount Mycale, which flows into a marsh bordering on the sea. Ephorus, fr. 91, ap. Athen. 311 E; F. H. G. i. 260; Mela, i. 17; Plin. N. H. v. 31, \u00a7 113. Probably the word potamo/n has fallen out of the text. *skolopo/eis. Placed by Wiegand (Priene, p. 17), arguing from an inscription at Domatia, on the east bank of the Gaeson, while the Persian stockade, to which perhaps it owes its name, must have been lower down on the west bank (Kiepert, Formae, No. vii n.). For Neleus cf. i. 147. 1. e(/rkos. Diodorus (xi. 34) adds a deep ditch. h(/mera. The destruction of fruit trees, although there was a large forest close by on the hill, showed reckless disregard of the Milesians' property, but cf. ch. 15. 2 n. If the words bracketed by Kr\u00fcger be retained in any form, they must mean that the Persians were prepared to stand a siege in defence of their fleet and to strike a blow for victory with their army (cf. 101. 3 ad fin.). a)poba/qras, 'gangways', here 'boarding-bridges'. Clearly the Greeks intended to fight in the old-fashioned way by boarding (Thuc. i. 49), not trusting to the new manuvres. For these cf. vi. 12 n. sunqh/matos, 'watchword' in battle or on the march, usually the name of a deity; cf. Xen. Anab. i. 8. 16; vi. 5. 25; vii. 3. 39. *(/hrhs is an almost certain conjecture, as the famous Heraeum (ch. 96. 1 n.) had been the starting-point of the Greek fleet, and stood behind their line of battle. The passage appears to be an interpolation modelled on viii. *milhsi/oisi. This re-appearance of the Milesians, who had all been killed or led away captive (vi. 19, 20 n.), is paralleled by that of the Eretrians who fought at Salamis (viii. 46. 2) and Plataea (ix. 28. 5), in spite of the similar fate that befell them in 490 B. C.; cf. vi. 101 n., 119. Doubtless H. exaggerated in both cases the completeness of the destruction wrought by the Persians. The dative after katedo/keon, 'whom they suspected,' seems to be on the analogy of katakri/nein (cf. vii. 146. 2). ge/rra: cf. ch. 61. 3 n. fh/mh. As has been shown by Grote (v. 47 f.), the multitude in all ages is subject to 'sudden unaccountable impressions', whether of panic or encouragement, which in an age of faith are naturally attributed to divine intervention. The fh/mh here is paralleled by that in Aeschines (in Timarch. \u00a7 128 f. and de Fals. Leg. \u00a7 144 f.; cf. also Paus. i. 17. 1) and by the o)/ssa of Homer (Il. ii. 93; Od. xxiv. 413). If, however, we are to find any real foundation for the report, we must either suppose with Grundy (p. 526) that it referred to one of the earlier successes of the Greeks in Boeotia, e. g. the death of Masistius, or we must give up the precise synchronism between Plataea and Mycale (\u00a7 2, ch. 101. 2). Either is better than the rationalizing suggestion of Ephorus (Diod. xi. 35; Polyaen. i. 33) that Leotychides invented the report to encourage his men, while the Persian generals told their troops that Xerxes was coming to their aid with a large force. The traditional precise synchronism between Plataea and Mycale (cf. Diod. xi. 34; Justin ii. 14) is a little discredited by the similar record as to the Himera and Salamis (vii. 166 n.), or the Himera and Thermopylae (Diod. xi. 24). Further, though no exact chronology is possible, if Mardonius was at Athens in June (ch. 3 n.), the battle of Plataea probably took place at the beginning of August (ch. 41. 1 n. and Busolt, ii. 725, n. 4). The dates in Plutarch, third Boedromion (Camill. 19, Moral. 349 F) and twenty-sixth Panemos=Metageitnion (Aristid. 19), seem to be those on which the victory was celebrated at Athens and at Plataea (cf. vi. 106. 3 n.). Mycale, on the other hand, is more naturally placed in the middle of August (Busolt, ii. 742, n. 2), since by the time that the Athenians have settled down to besiege Sestos it is autumn, i. e. mid-September, ch. 117 n. A fortnight's interval would give time for the rumour to cross the Aegaean. th=s au)th=s h(me/rhs. H. rather awkwardly confuses two ways of stating the same fact.

The Greek leaders apparently landed to the east of the Persian camp, and, finding the beach too narrow for the deployment of their troops, marched the left wing along it straight against the enemy, while the right wing made a turning movement (perih/isan) on the hills above. Then followed the breaking through the shield-wall and the rout of the Persians, and finally the capture of the camp. xara/dran. Perhaps the Gaeson, which served the Persians as a natural moat to their camp (ch. 97 n.). For Tigranes cf. ch. 96 and vii. 62. 1 n., for the other Persian leaders viii. 130. 2. e(teralkh\\sni/kh (or *)/arhs) means in Homer and Aeschylus (Pers. 930) 'decisive victory', but here and in viii. 11. 3 (e(teralke/ws 'inclining now this way and now that, anceps, undecided'. Ephorus, being from Cyme, was led by local patriotism to emphasize, and probably to exaggerate, the share of the Asiatic Greeks in the victory. He makes the appearance of the Samians and Milesians the turning-point in the battle, and declares that the Aeolians and others took part in the pursuit and slaughter of the Persians (Diod. xi. 36. 4, 5). *(ermo/lukos. Pausanias saw on the Acropolis a statue of Hermolycus, the Pancratiast, who is probably to be identified with the one here mentioned (cf. Frazer on Paus. i. 23. 10). pagkra/tion e)paskh/sas: cf. vi. 92. 2 n. The Pancratium was a mixture of boxing and wrestling. For a detailed account cf. E. N. Gardiner, J. H.

It was subdued by Athens in the war here mentioned, placed by Thucydides (i. 98) after the capture of Scyros and before the revolt of Naxos, i. e. circ. 472 B. C. (Busolt, iii. 140, n. 6).

Thessalians, Malians, Locrians, and Boeotians (except Thespiae and Plataea), but we may suppose many islands to be included, e. g. Andros, Tenos, Paros, and Carystus in Euboea (vii. 95 n.; viii. 66, 111 f.), and perhaps those Peloponnesian states whose neutrality savoured of treachery (viii. 73. 3 ad fin.), especially Argos (vii. 148 f.) and Achaia (vii. 94. n.; viii. 73. 1 n.). The idea of evacuating Ionia had been suggested by Bias (i. 170), and even partially carried out both in 546 B. C. (i. 164-8) and in 494 B. C. (vi. 17, 20). Hence there is nothing improbable in its suggestion here. Possibly, too, it might be regarded as a military measure within the competence of Leotychides and his council, though a question of such far-reaching importance as the expulsion of the Medizers should surely have been referred to the Probouloi at the Isthmus. Diodorus (xi. 37), in saying that both Ionians and Athenians at first agreed, and that the latter repented only when the Ionians and Aeolians had made all their preparations to emigrate, is guilty of foolish exaggeration, since the assent of the Ionians is not in accord with their strong attachment to their native land (cf. i. 165; vi. 3). H. distinctly limits admission into the league to the islanders present with the Greek fleet. We have already heard of the Chians and Samians (viii. 132; ix. 90 f.), but the Lesbians are here first mentioned. Presumably they had previously joined but H. omitted their adhesion, just as he omits to mention the presence of allies as well as Athenians at the siege of Sestos (ch. 114. 2 n.). The other loyal islanders (enumerated in viii. 46 and n.) must have been long before formally admitted to the league (cf. vii. 145). There is a difficulty as to the position of the Greeks on the mainland. H. here appears to exclude them, and in ch. 101 ad fin. makes 'the islands' and the Hellespont the prize of victory, yet Ionia (in which Miletus is included) has already 'revolted from Persia' (ch. 104 ad fin.), and, according to Thucydides (i. 89), allies from Ionia and the Hellespont helped the Athenians to take Sestos, while Ionians and others lately freed from the king are foremost in promoting the transference of the hegemony to Athens (i. 95). Diodorus (xi. 37) cuts the knot by admitting to the league all Aeolians and Ionians without distinction, which has led Steup to insert kai\\ tou\\s h)peirw/tas here. But Diodorus in this chapter is full of errors, and it seems better to suppose that such Greeks of the mainland as revolted from Persia were at first informally under the protection of Athens, and that they were only granted a formal alliance later, probably when the hegemony was transferred to Athens (cf. Busolt, iii. 39, 40). Of course many Greek states in Asia remained subject to Persia for years after this (cf. vi. 42 n.). ta\\s gefu/ras. The bridge had perished ten months before (viii. 117), but the Greeks may well have been ignorant of the fact so long as the Hellespont was in the hands of the enemy.

This would be most interesting if true, but Xenagoras cannot well have been satrap of Cilicia, because that country, though called a satrapy (iii. 90), remained till at least 400 B. C. under the rule of its native princes (Xen. Cyrop. vii. 4. 2), who bore the title *sue/nnesis. Cf. i. 74. 3 n. (585 B. C.); v. 118. 2 (500 B. C.); vii. 98, and Aesch. Pers. 326 (480 B.

So the strati/h of Masistes (ch. 113 ad fin.) can hardly have been more than a guard. For birthday feasts cf. i. 133. Plato (Alcib. i, p. 121 C) says that the birthday of the king's eldest son was celebrated with feasting throughout the Empire. tukta/ = Persian tacht. sma=tai: cf. iv. 73. 2. It would seem that the king, who at all other times appeared in full royal dress crowned with the tiara (cf. vii. 61. 1), on the day of this feast showed his head bare, and, like his companions at table, smeared it with ointments. *pe/rsas dwre/etai.

Thucydides (i. 89) speaks as if the Peloponnesians had sailed straight home from Mycale, but adds the significant fact that Ionians and Hellespontines helped to the fuller account should be followed. Thucydides omits the fruitless voyage of the Peloponnesians, but supplies an omission in H. (cf. ch. 106). Sestos was of great importance to Athens as commanding the corn-route to the Euxine (vii. 147. 2 n.), and as the strongest (ch. 115) place in the Chersonese (Thuc. viii. 62; Xen. Hell. iv. 8. 5), on which Athens had claims founded on the dominion of Miltiades (cf. vi. 34 f.); App. XVI, \u00a7 8. e)o/ntos: for the case cf. viii. 69. 1 n.

Artayctes is also leader of the Macrones and Mossynoeci (vii. 78); cf. Masistes, vii. 82, ix. 113; Meyer, iii, \u00a7 42 n. Protesilaus of Phylace in Phthiotis was slain as he landed on the Trojan shore (Il. ii. 701to\\n a hero at Phylace (Pindar, Isthm. i. 58) and generally (cf. Wordsworth, Laodamia) so regarded (Paus. iii. 4. 6), yet at Elaeus he was worshipped as a god (ch. 120. 3; Paus. i. 34. 2). Probably he was a native deity identified with the Greek hero from similarity of name. His oracle, like those of Amphiaraus and Trophonius (with whom Pausanias, i. 34. 2, compares him), was frequented by the sick (Philos. Her. 670, 678 f.). For Elaeus cf. vi. 140. 1 n. Cf. vii. 5. 2 n. The request for a man's house was so natural that the king had no suspicion of the sacrilege intended.

This barbarity, unusual on the part of Greeks, may be explained by the enormity of the outrage or by Athenian deference to local feeling. The ruggedness of Persia proper is frequently insisted on in antiquity, rightly in the main; cf. i. 71. 2 f.; Plat. Laws 695 A; Anab. in more points (Stein); cf. a(/pasi (i. 1. 2, 91. 6). H. ascribes to Cyrus the teaching of Hippocrates peri\\ throughout assumes the influence of climate on character and on institutions. Differences between one folk and another he would trace in part to differences in physical and geographical environment, since he is convinced of the relativity of human institutions (cf.

It recalls the fact that the Persians, though now defeated, were a famous race of warriors; it perhaps is intended to warn the conquerors that they too may suffer decline and fall if they relax their discipline (cf. vii. 102). No doubt the moral is a little obvious, the literary artifice somewhat na\u00efve, but is not all "}
