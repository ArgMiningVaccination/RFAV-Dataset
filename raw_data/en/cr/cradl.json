Feeling tired and in pain? I was there too. I am a Functional Medicine Certified Health Coach, and creator of Inspired Living with Autoimmunity, helping people create lifestyle changes to reduce their inflammation and allow them to reclaim their full lives. I coach motivated people who are ready to do the work, take their power back, and reclaim their lives. I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in 2004 and spent a decade declining under the care of conventional doctors. At my lowest point I was taking ten prescriptions, while still in pain and exhausted. I had believed the doctors when they said that there was nothing I could do but take my meds and expect to decline. As a single mom with three kids, I knew I had to find another way. Out of desperation I took action. I researched and studied and implemented all of the changes that my western trained doctors said wouldn't help. Over time, I began to heal. I sought out a Functional Medicine doctor and took back my life. I am now on none of those prescriptions and have returned to full health. I am not the exception; I am the rule. Working on diet, stress management, sleep, exercise and environmental detox supports the body to function as designed and heal. Through my journey, it has become my mission to educate and support people to find true wellness. In 2017 I became a Certified Human Potential Coach and have continued on to become a Functional Medicine Certified Health Coach in order to best support my clients. I am a Certified Autoimmune Protocol Coach as well in order to best understand autoimmunity and how to support healing. I work with clients one-on one over the phone and via Zoom to support individualized lifestyle changes that reduce inflammation. Inspired Living with Autoimmunity is my four-month program that combines individual and group coaching and includes educational resources for you to move through the five lifestyle areas to create healing.
