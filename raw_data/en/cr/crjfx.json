Programs for All Encountering the Living God | 10-Week Program A 10-week program of prayer and reflection, under the personal guidance of one of the Murphy Center's trained spiritual directors. This program is open to Fairfield students, faculty, staff and members of the larger community. Its method and content are inspired by the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius o f Loyola. Participants meet weekly with a spiritual director for ten consecutive weeks. 19th Annotation, Spiritual Exercises in Everyday Life (SEEL) | Year-Long Program A guided retreat accompanied by a Spiritual Director, the 19th Annotation, Spiritual Exercises in Everyday Life (SEEL) program helps participants better discern God's presence in their everyday life. The SEEL retreat usually lasts at least a year, during which time the retreatant meets weekly with a director and follows the model of prayer outlined by St. Ignatius of Loyola. The retreatant commits to daily prayer, while continuing his or her normal routine. This is known widely as \"The Retreat in Daily Life\" or \"The 19th Annotation Retreat.\" Ideally, participants should be in spiritual direction before undertaking the SEEL in this form. Life After the Exercises Intended for those from the University and Prep community and beyond, who have completed the full Exercises of St. Ignatius and who seek to nourish and refresh the graces received during the Exercises. Includes an annual retreat, regular study sessions on themes of Ignatian Spirituality, and small groups for faith-sharing. [Request Information](mailto:mcis@fairfield.edu) Monthly Spiritual Direction Is for anyone, of any faith, who is seeking a deeper connection with God. Participants meet monthly with a spiritual director who can assist them in developing the skills needed to recognize the presence of God in their life. A spiritual director is a companion who aids in listening for the movements of the Sacred. The spiritual director helps a person pay attention to God's personal communication, respond, grow in intimacy with God, and live out the invitations that emerge from that relationship. Walking Examen Fairfield University's Walking Examen is the first of its kind on a Jesuit campus. Beginning on the plaza of Egan Chapel, this mile-long prayer and meditation trail was designed to cultivate prayerful discernment and an awareness of God's presence around us. The Examen is a contemplative prayer practice made popular by St. Ignatius of Loyola that invites us to see God in our everyday lives. There are five steps to the Walking Examen identified by five large rocks with a plaque. Each step signifies the five movements of the Examen prayer: Thanksgiving, Illumination, Examination, Contrition, and Hope. Bookmarks with maps are available in the Library, Campus Ministry, Admission, and in the Murphy Center for anyone who would like to follow the route.
