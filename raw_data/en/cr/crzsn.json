It generated lots of media interest in Wolfson and the Challenge Team. This September marks the end of the College's 50th Anniversary fundraising campaign, as well as the term of our President Sir Richard Evans. The outcome of the campaign is described by Sian Cook on page 10 in her introduction as our new Development Director. And our Vice-President Graham Allen on page 7 introduces our next President, Professor Jane Clarke, who will start her term on 1 October 2017. This academic year featured another very successful Wolfson Research Event, an illuminating Lee Seng Tee Lecture by Neil MacGregor, formerly Director of the British Museum, attractive and colourful Art exhibitions, and many and varied musical performances as described in the 'Lectures and Events' section. 'Wolfson Society' covers the activities of the wide range of College societies, and the contributions under the heading 'My journey to Wolfson' are a snapshot of how just some members of our diverse community made it to the College. This Easter Term we welcomed five new Press Fellows to Wolfson, and two of them, Rebecca MacFie and Lidiana Rosli, describe their research projects on Climate Change and Islamic Finance, respectively. The 'Sport' section reflects growing sporting interest and success and now includes Athletics, Cross-Country and Social Rowing as new activities. Social Rowing tries to cater for rowers of all abilities, from complete novices to current and former College rowers. And W1 won blades in the May Bumps. As Editor, I must once again express my deep gratitude to all the contributors for their keen interest in this Wolfson Review, and for submitting their pieces on time, facilitating my editorial tasks. This issue wouldn't appear without the help of our Communications Officer, Sheila Betts, who is retiring in October after 14 years at the College. Her keen eye for detail and in particular the quality of all the illustrations is greatly appreciated. And H2 Associates have done the College proud again in producing another attractive Review. editor@wolfson.cam.ac.uk www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 5 College Reports6 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017From the President Professor Sir Richard Evans frsl fba On 30 September 2017 I shall reach the end of the seven-year tenure of the office of President of Wolfson prescribed by the College's Statutes. It's been an exciting and enjoyable time, with the 50th Anniversary celebrations in 2015 as its centre-point. It was wonderful to see so many friends and former students and colleagues at the Anniversary weekend in Wolfson as well as meeting alumni of the College in many parts of the world, from Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to New York, Boston, Washington and Berlin. Everywhere I've been struck by how much warmth and loyalty the College has inspired in its former students and Visiting Fellows. Part of the remit given to me in 2010 was to help raise Wolfson College's profile in Cambridge and beyond. I hope my own publications, radio and television appearances, and newspaper articles have contributed to this, including (whichever way you take it) my very public row with Michael Gove over his misguided attempt to reform the History curriculum in 2013. More importantly, beginning with the superb exhibition of Richard Deacon maquettes in the anniversary year, our Fine Arts Committee, which I established shortly after my appointment, has done wonders in putting the College on the map, most recently with superb exhibitions of works by Eileen Cooper and Richard Sorrell. Other cultural highlights have included my podium discussion in 2014 with Martin Amis about his novel The Zone of Interest, and this year's Lee Seng Tee Distinguished Lecture by former British Museum Director Neil MacGregor, a curtain-raiser for his radio series, book and exhibition on the coercion of belief and its representation in art. Finally I hope I will be excused for admitting that I could not have done the job without the active and energetic involvement of my wife, Dr Christine Corton, whose own book, London Fog: The Biography was published to widespread acclaim at the end of the anniversary year. It's wonderful that the College has (unprompted!) recognised her essential contribution by commissioning a double portrait of us both by Susan Ryder to hang on the Gallery wall from September. As all this suggests, the College has now established itself as a vibrant and exciting centre of contemporary culture. I'm delighted to hand it over to my distinguished successor Professor Jane Clarke, who I know will take the College from strength to strength over the next seven years. College Reportswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 7The Sixth President: Professor Jane Clarke FMedSci FRS Graham Allen, Vice-President I approached the task of running the election of a new President for Wolfson with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. Contrary to normal 'HR' practice the job description is skeletal, there are few 'selection criteria' and the decision is in the hands of a diverse and sophisticated electorate, namely the 120 Fellows who constitute the Governing Body. Happily and thanks to the support of many colleagues, and the patience of our outstanding candidates, my worst fears proved groundless and I was delighted on 1 March 2017 to announce the election of Professor Jane Clarke to a packed Governing Body. Professor Clarke was brought up in Cambridge and obtained a first-class honours degree in Biochemistry from the University of York in 1972. After completing a PGCE at Cambridge, she became a science teacher and, for a time, served as Head of Science at an inner-London comprehensive school. She moved to the United States in 1987 and was bitten by the research 'bug' . On returning to Cambridge she joined the research group of Professor Sir Alan Fersht FRS in the MRC Centre for Protein Engineering and was awarded a PhD in 1994. She has held a highly prestigious Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship since 2001 and was promoted to a personal Chair in Molecular Biophysics in 2010. Her pioneering work as an international research leader in the field of protein folding has been recognised by her election as a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2013, and as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2015, as well as the award of numerous international prizes. She is passionate about increasing diversity in higher education and supporting the personal and professional development of students, young researchers, and academics, irrespective of background or origin. She serves on the Education and Diversity Committees of the Royal Society. Her career and inclusive collaborative leadership style have a particular resonance with the ethos and values of the College. We are delighted that Jane and her husband Chris, a retired banker, have already been able to join us for a number of significant College events, including the final of University Challenge. Professor Clarke will be installed as President at the Governing Body meeting on 11 October 2017. \u00a9 University of CambridgeCollege Reports8 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017From the College Officers Christopher Lawrence, Bursar This is my 11th such annual report. Each year I have written about the College's finances, and I will do so here again, but this year I want to mention the College's accommodation. Our financial year ends on 30 June, and the audited accounts for 2016-2017 will be available on the College's website in November 2017. So let me give you the key numbers from our most recent audited accounts, for 2015-2016. Total income was \u00a38.7m, and total operational expenditure was \u00a36.7m, with a further \u00a31.5m of capital expenditure and \u00a30.9m of new investments. The main sources of income were academic fees (\u00a32.5m) and catering /accommodation (\u00a33.5m), and the main area of expenditure was staff costs (\u00a33.2m). Endowment investments, which are mainly invested in the Cambridge University Endowment Fund (CUEF), were valued at \u00a320.2m at 30 June 2016, and in addition the College held a further \u00a31.5m in the CUEF, bringing the total of endowment and other investments to \u00a321.7m. The main thrust of our 50th Anniversary Campaign has been student support, in particular the provision of bursaries, scholarships, grants and prizes. In 2015-2016 we disbursed funds of \u00a3281k to over 200 students (plus a further \u00a3217k of funds from the Isaac Newton Trust and the University), a marked increase on the equivalent figure for 2005-2006 of just \u00a366k. Our ambitions for the future include larger awards to more students, in particular bursaries and scholarships that encourage students to apply to Wolfson and enable them to benefit from a Cambridge education, which they might otherwise not be able to afford. Turning now to our accommodation, we have 410 units of student accommodation, five family flats, and a further 38 rooms for visitors. All of Wolfson's accommodation is on our College site, so we don't have any far-flung houses in other parts of Cambridge, and the compact nature of our College is one of its many benefits. At the moment, supply and demand are in balance, and Wolfson is normally able to offer accommodation in College to all undergraduates for all years of their course; to all Master's students; and to PhD students for three years. This accommodation offer for postgraduates makes us unique among the Cambridge colleges and is one of our major selling points. College Reportswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 9Of the 410 units of student accommodation, 367 are in the purpose-built blocks A to V and the other 43 units are in the various houses on site. Taking into account all 453 units of accommodation, if they were all full we would have 520 people of all ages sleeping on site - a far cry from our earliest days when the College consisted of Bredon House alone, with just a few bedrooms in the attic. Jane McLarty, Senior Tutor What makes Wolfson unique? I regularly hear that we offer postgraduates far more than other Colleges, such as our range of seminar programmes, and College accommodation for up to three years (four years for someone who has been with us for their MPhil studies). Postgraduate students are at the centre of our interests, which is not the case for most other Colleges. For our undergraduates, as the mature College with the largest intake, we can offer a real sense of community. Our Academic Skills programme (see page 36) runs sessions tailored to undergraduates, such as essay-writing and exam revision. In a recent brainstorming meeting for overhauling our website, students commented that Wolfson is a close-knit community, inclusive, diverse, modern and open to the world. (They also think we should promote the lovely gardens, where none of us is banned from the lawns.) We are presently advertising for a Student Recruitment Officer for the College whose task will be to ensure that our offering is enthusiastically promoted: our student intake remains healthy at present, but Brexit looms on the horizon and around 30% of our current postgraduate students are from the EU. This year, we revised our induction weekend and on the Sunday afternoon put on a range of seminars that students could choose from, with subjects from how to find books and articles to working in a lab. For the 2017 intake we will bring in the mature undergraduates a couple of days earlier for induction tailored specifically for them, which will enable them to get to know one another as a cohort. We have expanded our welfare provision this year. Dr Martin Vestergaard, our Deputy Senior Tutor, has been liaising with the Samaritans to arrange regular drop-in evening sessions in College to offer emotional support. We are also participating in a three-year pilot scheme with the University Counselling Service where we have a College-based Counsellor, employed by the UCS, located in College for one day a week. Our counsellor has been fully booked with a short waiting-list since the service began, so there is clearly a demand for this provision. College Reports10 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017On the academic side, Meg Westbury, our College Librarian, has been running her popular 'shut up and write' sessions again this year. Students wanting to work on an extended piece of writing gather together in one of our seminar rooms, talk about what they aim to achieve, write for an hour, have a break, and then repeat the process: a great way to break writer's block. We are about to recruit an Information Skills Librarian whose role will be to oversee an innovative programme of information and digital literacies support, keeping Wolfson at the cutting edge of support for students. There is then a great deal that distinguishes Wolfson: and we are committed to keeping the College at the forefront of graduate and mature undergraduate provision in the collegiate University. Sian Cook, Development Director I was delighted to be appointed as Development Director and to join the Wolfson team in June. A huge thank you to everyone for your warm and generous welcome. It is a tremendously positive time to join the College - with the 50th Anniversary Campaign drawing to a close, the impact of its fundraising success can be clearly seen through an increase in student support and the improved facilities Wolfson can now offer. Over the past nine years, the amount of funds raised through the Development Office has steadily grown. All this provides an excellent foundation from which to raise our sights and to be even more ambitious for the future. My working life has been spent in National Museums, the British Heart Foundation and at the Royal Institute of British Architects - organisations where equality and excellence are at their core. This has made me passionate about education and opportunities for people from all backgrounds to achieve their full potential, and the difference that education makes to life chances. Wolfson is a great place to be and I hope that together we can do much more and make a greater impact. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible. College Reportswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 11Emma Adlard, Deputy Development Director Earlier this year, I was honoured to be asked to step up as Acting Development Director while the College sought Karen Stephenson's successor. I am writing this piece on the day that I have returned to the Deputy Development Director's office in order that Sian Cook can take up the reins of the Development and Alumni Relations Office. The last academic year has been a particularly lively one for the Development Office. The establishment of the Deputy Development Director role, expanding the team from three to four members of staff, has allowed us to host a good dozen events throughout the year and also to launch some new initiatives. Our new Member of the Month feature on the Wolfson College LinkedIn page and our adoption of the #throwbackthursday trend have helped to engage Wolfson members all over the world in the daily life, community and history of our College via social media; and a new donation platform has allowed individuals to make Direct Debit gifts online for the very first time. A particular highlight of the year was Wolfson's first City Party in May - a drinks reception and professional networking event for College members based in London - and its associated Student Bursary Appeal, which has raised cash and pledges worth \u00a330,787 to support Wolfson students in hardship. The end of September will see our seven-year 50th Anniversary Campaign draw to a close with a special event for all the Campaign's donors on 17 September. As at 15 June 2017, the Campaign has raised just over \u00a35.2m in cash, with a further \u00a31.9m pledged, and a total of 1197 individuals, trusts, foundations and corporate bodies have made a gift to the Campaign. Since 2010, donations have enabled us to refurbish blocks A to G and M to P to a high specification. Moreover, this year, we have been able to allocate nearly \u00a3500k to student support in the form of merit-based scholarships, hardship bursaries, prizes and other grants - more than ever before. This academic year, over 200 of our students received some form of student support. It is hard to capture in the written word just how immensely grateful we are to all our donors for their support during this Campaign period. A generous early gift of \u00a31.25m from the Wolfson Foundation funded the refurbishment of accommodation they had helped to build in the 1970s; and a further boost came in the form of a pledge from The ALBORADA Trust worth \u00a31.62m over ten years to support Veterinary and Medical Science students. Yet, we have been equally reliant on smaller, regular gifts - it is the significant impact we can achieve together as a cohesive community that really matters. We appeal to you, therefore, to help us maintain the momentum we have achieved via the 50th Anniversary Campaign by making a gift online at www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk/alumni/donations or by completing the enclosed form. And thank you, once again, for your valued engagement with Wolfson College and for playing an active role in its distinctively supportive community. College Reports12 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017The Library Meg Westbury, Fellow and Lee Seng Tee Librarian Increasingly these days I am reminded that a library is more than the housing, discovery and consumption of information - though it is of course, still all those things - it is also in the business of creating and sharing knowledge, and very much in the relationship business. Through the library's ongoing interactions - such as helping with navigation of research resources and use of various tools for managing information and, of course, providing a friendly face and safe space to work - we help develop students' nascent identities as researchers. So the library is more than its building, collections, website and staff - it is all of those working in concert, whilst staying abreast of students' changing academic needs and the ever-evolving digital landscape of higher education. In line with this perspective, we recently created a position for an Information Skills Librarian which we hope to fill by the end of the summer. This librarian will provide training and advice on research skills and management, and help students find a tool and skill set that best meets their course and personal preferences. We continue to teach workshops and hold bespoke consultations on a wide-range of information-seeking and management skills and have started to hold regular thesis-writing sessions for postgraduate students. I feel grateful this year to have a student advisory group generously organised by WCSA. This group has proved invaluable already in making some good improvements to the library - we now have a kettle and fridge, for example - and helping develop the Easter Term desk-use policy. The library is carrying on its tradition of holding weekly teas for students during Easter Term, which are always well attended, and this summer we plan to add comfortable seating to the Sir David Williams Room and to re-carpet the library reading room. And lest you think that we no longer deal with books, we do! The 2016-2017 academic year saw an addition of some 1300 new books to our collection, more than 200 books over the previous year's acquisitions. College Reportswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 13The College Archive Frieda Midgley, Archivist and Records Manager This year, the College Archives are helping to celebrate the 40th anniversary of a number of important milestones in the development of the College, which mark its coming of age as an institution. On 1 January 1977, the College's Royal Charter and new Statutes came into effect and Wolfson College became an independent College of the University. Governing Body held its first meeting on 10 January, and 19 January saw the final meeting of the Trustees, who had overseen our journey to becoming an independent college with our own buildings and accommodation, well on the way to financial security. But the ceremonial highlight of the year was undoubtedly the official Opening of the College by Her Majesty the Queen on 9 November, in the year of her Silver Jubilee. Her Majesty the Queen unveils the commemorative panel, which was then placed in the Dining Hall \u00a9 Cambridge NewspapersCollege Reports14 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017The President, John Morrison, observed in the College Magazine that the fortnight leading up to the occasion had seen a 'growing momentum of completion...handsome iron railings and gates; the car-park; the turfing and planting of the Library [sundial] garden; and the appearance of two lions surmounting the pillars of the inner gates'. Fortunately for us, student Martin Pick documented these preparations and the day itself in a wonderful series of photographs. We also have film of the speeches, and the unveiling of the commemorative panel that now hangs in the Dining Hall. The College had adopted a policy of allowing members to wear the gown of their highest degree on scarlet days, within the College. This was of particular significance to those such as Mary Hesse, then Vice-President, whose highest degrees were from other universities, and therefore not generally recognised in Cambridge at the time. So the Royal Opening is remembered by many as being particularly colourful, though unconventional. So do take a look at the commemorative gallery on the website, and it would be lovely to hear from you if you have any information or items that you think may be of interest - please email archivist@ wolfson.cam.ac.uk Chef Ray Palmer and colleagues prepare the celebratory luncheon Unloading turf to put the finishing touches to the Library [sundial] garden Martin Pick Martin PickCollege Reportswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 15Wolfson Gardens: gardening is good for the heart, soul and mind Philip Stigwood, Head Gardener Gardening has been a big part of my life for the last 40+ years and I am blessed to have a job that I love. I grew up driving tractors from the age of 12 and collecting eggs on my dad's poultry farm but I was always happiest when cutting the grass and pruning dad's much-loved roses in the farmhouse garden. After College I worked at the National Institute of Agricultural/Plant Botany (NIAB), Cambridge, for the next 18 years, as a plant pathologist. In my spare time I was gardening in private gardens in Cambridge, and also learning a great deal from my horticultural friends at NIAB, who undertake growing trials on plants in over 100 genera specialising in roses, dahlias, herbaceous perennials, woody plants and a wide range of basket and container plants. The role of NIAB is to see if new varieties meet the criteria for plant breeders' rights (must be distinct from other varieties, stable and not revert to parent types, etc.) Perennials and shrubs, Lee Garden Ornamental grasses and Phormium 'Jester' College Reports16 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017NIAB also do gardening trials for Which? Gardening to establish the best of the new varieties available to the domestic gardener. I was thrilled to get my dream job at Wolfson 16 years ago. The College gardens have developed greatly in my time here, now having a diverse range of plants and much year-round colour, structure and interest. This has been possible with the great support of Chris Lawrence, who realised the importance of our gardens as a place of serenity and relaxation for students and staff. He has invested heavily in the Garden Department, allowing me to employ the best gardeners available and plant many new areas and borders during this time. We now have around 60 different varieties of roses, as opposed to around 10 when I arrived. Roses are a passion of mine, especially repeat-flowering, scented shrub roses. I recently had my 'mid-life' health MOT with my GP , and it highlighted a problem, high cholesterol. I assumed statins would be prescribed to reduce this but to my surprise she asked what my profession was. When she heard I had a physical job as a gardener she stated that this was the best 'preventative medicine' for heart disease and sent me on my way! So not only do I have the best job in the world but also the best job for my heart, soul and mind!

The lecture series was endowed in 2005 on the occasion of the College's 40th anniversary by Dr Lee Seng Tee, the Singaporean businessman whose granddaughter is an alumna of the College. This year's Lee Seng Tee Lecturer, Neil MacGregor, left his job as Director of the British Museum at the end of 2015 to set up the new Humboldt Forum in Berlin. He is well known for curating major exhibitions concerning the relationship between faith and society, first at the National Gallery and then at the British Museum, accompanying them with book publications and radio broadcasts. Best known is his History of the World in 100 Objects where he gave 'voice' to significant objects and their 'witness' of their culture and times. This autumn he is embarking on a major new exhibition, radio series and book publication in partnership with the BBC and the British Museum. Entitled Living with the Gods, here, again, he will be using objects from the Museum to illustrate the interactions between art, culture and religious belief. The starting point, he says, is that \"Questions of faith have, in recent decades, moved to the centre of the global political stage - an unexpected return to a centuries-old pattern. But\", he asks, \"what are the connections between structures of belief, and the structures of society?\" The lecture gave us a foretaste of some of the answers Neil MacGregor is going to provide, by focusing on two seventeenth-century persecutions of foreigners by strongly centralising governments following periods of civil unrest. These were signalled by two objects. In Japan a government notice of 1682 offered rewards for identifying and reporting Christians who were then rounded up and martyred. In France the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 led to the destruction of the Temple at Charenton, recorded in a print, and the harsh suppression of Protestants forcing them into exile or recantation. The destruction of holy sites in the conflicts between Hindus and Muslims, especially the destruction of the Ayodhya Mosque in 1992, invited contemplation of our own times and how we deal with integration. The lecture with its fresh insights and unusual illustrations whetted the appetite for the much larger treatment MacGregor is going to give the subject this coming autumn. Living with the Gods starts on 23 October 2017 on BBC Radio 4.Neil McGregor John NaughtonLectures and Eventswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 21Wolfson Research Event Matthias Wong (2013), Student This year's Wolfson Research Event (WRE) took place on Friday 24 February, and consisted of two keynote talks, as well as 12 presentations and 12 posters from both Wolfson and our Oxford sister college, St Antony's. As befits our reputation as the University's most cosmopolitan college, this year's line-up featured researchers from as far afield as India, Malaysia and Ghana. The presentations covered an impressive range of subjects and disciplines, a distinctive aspect of the WRE that makes it unique in the University calendar. Our opening keynote speaker was the renowned Cambridge economist and Wolfson alumnus Dr Ha-Joon Chang, who shared his experience of writing for the general public. As a bestselling author whose books have reached millions, Dr Chang offered useful and practical advice on the important subject of public engagement. Our twelve speakers covered topics including Russia-EU relations, female Holocaust perpetrators, Chechen refugees, protests against austerity, artisanal gold-mining, Southeast Asian literature, musicians' injuries, cellular reprogramming, diabetes and obesity, and human genomics. Our poster session ranged from posters on ferromagnets and Chilean literature, to Parkinson's disease and women's rights in India. In the concluding keynote address, Professor Jane Clarke FMedSci FRS about her personal journey through academia. Despite starting her PhD relatively late, at the age of 40, she has built a distinguished career in research. She spoke about the importance of family and friends in supporting her work, and of the challenge in aiding young women to pursue their passion in science. This year's event broke new ground on various fronts. With over a hundred individuals participating, it was the best-attended since the first WRE in 2007. This year's committee has striven to further professionalise the event with a newly-designed logo, and a standardised visual identity used across print and online media. Thanks to the generous support of Senior Member Dr Terry Hart, the keynote addresses are available for viewing at www.wolfson. cam.ac.uk/previous-research-events. The committee would also like to acknowledge the support of the College and in particular Meg Westbury, Fellow and Lee Librarian, in making this event a resounding success. \u00a9 University of CambridgeWolfson Research 22 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Modelling autistic neurons Aicha Massrali (2015), Student Aicha presented her PhD research at this year's Wolfson Research Event and won the presentation prize. Here she describes her journey into the subject. I was first introduced to autism when my baby cousin was diagnosed with it. This ignited my interest in the condition and learning about autism was my window to understanding his world and to connecting with this special boy. After studying biotechnology in Egypt, my home country, I went on to a Masters in molecular biology and medical genetics in the UK. Alongside my education, I became involved in autism advocacy and awareness, and started campaigning for autism inclusion programmes at Egyptian universities. Next, I decided to pursue a research career in autism biology and was delighted to be given the opportunity to join the Autism Research Centre here in Cambridge for a PhD under Simon Baron-Cohen at the Department of Psychiatry. Autism is often referred to as an enigma because of its complexity and unidentified cause. Although signs appear at the age of two, autism already starts in the womb. In order to figure out how this condition affects early brain development, we need a live model system. Recently, scientists developed a Nobel Prize-winning method to rejuvenate or reprogramme adult somatic cells (hair, skin or blood) to an embryonic-like state (induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSC for short); these iPSCs are then differentiated into any other cell type (e.g. neurons). This means that scientists can take a hair sample from an autism patient and, from it, grow autism brain cells in a dish - a useful live model system to study autism during early brain development. In my PhD research, I rely on this technology to derive neurons from autism patients as well as controls. I then perform experimental investigations on these neurons to identify the cellular pathways involved in autism, and hopefully find new drug targets. The warm and welcoming environment of Wolfson College has made my Cambridge experience very exciting. Taking part in the WRE gave me an opportunity to communicate my research to students from various fields, as well as learn about their research and make new friends from Wolfson and St Antony's. Wolfson Research www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 23Jet engine aerodynamics and turbomachinery design Wen Yao Lee (2014), Student Wen Yao presented his PhD research at this year's Wolfson Research Event and describes how he became fascinated by his subject. After encountering the Concorde, the SR-71 Blackbird and the Space Shuttle at a very young age, I was captivated by the idea of flight and became fascinated with aircraft. Some of my earliest memories were of me visiting the local airport in Ipoh, Malaysia, to watch the planes take off and land. Naturally, I pursued science in school but I only made the decision to study engineering at university, after turning down offers to do medicine. At Imperial College London, I studied aeronautical engineering and specialised in wing design. Upon graduating, I joined Rolls-Royce plc and worked in design, manufacturing, testing and even spent some time in Toulouse, France with the flight test team for the Airbus A350. My final role was in their strategy and future programmes team before moving to Cambridge to pursue my MRes and PhD in Engineering. I am always looking to further develop my technical abilities and the idea of being at the forefront of technology excites me. Therefore I joined the Whittle Laboratory, a centre dedicated to the aerodynamics of turbomachinery (jet engines, gas turbine generators, turbochargers, etc.). My current research interest is in creating a holistic approach to the design and manufacturing of high-pressure turbine blades for jet engines for passenger planes. These blades are geometrically intricate and operate in an environment hotter than the melting point of most metals, whilst producing a massive amount of power. Efficiency is the primary driver of design and in order to make further advances, the performance of real engine components needs to be understood to ensure that intended performance benefits are not eroded by manufacturing uncertainty and re-design costs. Wolfson College has been instrumental in creating a community for postgraduates outside their research groups. The WRE and the College have facilitated the creation of a diverse, global network of individuals with a whole spectrum of interests, something truly unique to Wolfson. I am grateful for what I've experienced so far and look forward to meeting many more people along my PhD journey. Wolfson Research 24 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Management studies Todd Bridgman (2001), Visiting College Research Associate and School of Management, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand Spending my sabbatical year as an academic Visitor to Wolfson has been a wonderful way of reconnecting with the College, where I lived between 2001 and 2005 whilst undertaking a PhD at Judge Business School, followed by a Wolfson Junior Research Fellowship. The faces of the students have changed, but it was great to see a number of the same (albeit slightly older) faces amongst the College staff and to renew those friendships. The staff play a key role as carriers of Wolfson's past and transmitters of its values, and really do make Wolfson such a magical place. It has been special to share the experience with my wife, Maria, daughter Sierra (who was born the day before the family flats opened in April 2005 and was their first resident), and her three siblings, Savannah, Leo and Zac. Whilst we have outgrown College accommodation, we have all been regular visitors to Wolfson throughout the year - the final of University Challenge and Saturday brunches being highlights. I have also enjoyed being part of Wolfson Cricket once again, playing on the finest cricket grounds that a very average cricketer could ever dream of! During the year I have been continuing to research the history of my field, management studies, and in particular, how this history is recorded in undergraduate textbooks. I am critical of the ideologically blinkered view of history that is presented to management students, where the ideas of those the field draws upon are twisted to fit a free-market capitalist, managerialist worldview. I suspect that Adam Smith, Max Weber, Kurt Lewin, Abraham Maslow and others would be appalled by their characterisation in management textbooks. In other cases, it is the absence that is jarring. During the year I researched Stanley Milgram's famous obedience experiments, which feature prominently in social psychology textbooks yet are missing from most management textbooks. It seems that while social psychology believes its students should understand the dangers of people following blindly those in authority, management studies do not. Management students therefore miss the rich insights we can draw from Milgram's experiments for understanding organisational life - knowledge that would, in my view, make them better managers. During my time at Wolfson I have sought to address these deficits and others, in a monograph A New History of Management (Cambridge University Press), to which I have been putting the finishing touches.. Wolfson Research www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 25Conspiracy and democracy Sir Richard Evans frsl fba, President Wolfson College has played a major role in the five-year research programme Conspiracy and Democracy, funded to the tune of \u00a31.58 million by the Leverhulme Trust. The President and (in 2013) Vice- President were Principal Investigators, one of the postdoctoral researchers is a College Research Associate, and the College has played host to the many Visiting Fellows and speakers who have come from all over the world to deliver the project's Tuesday evening public lectures. It's been an ideal collaboration between CRASSH (Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities), where the research is based, and the College. When we started, conspiracy theories were mainly of academic interest, and our investigation covered many areas of the topic, from 'big data' analysis and opinion polls (which we commissioned from YouGov) to historical examples from the 18th and 19th centuries and the place of conspiracy theories in literature and in political thought. But since the election of Donald Trump as US President, our research has taken on a more urgent contemporary significance. For Trump himself is a genuine conspiracy theorist, promoting the theory of a conspiracy to cover up the 'fact' that his predecessor Barack Obama was not born in the USA, or a conspiracy to send huge numbers of Mexicans to the USA, or the involvement of the father of his opponent for the Republican Presidential nomination, Ted Cruz, in a supposed conspiracy to kill President Kennedy in 1963, and many, many more. The rise of Donald Trump has been accompanied by a deluge of 'post-truth' and 'alternative facts' where Presidential aides have dealt with attacks on the veracity of Trump's statements simply by reasserting them irrespective of the evidence - for example, when photographs showed that the crowds in Washington's Mall at his Inauguration were far smaller than those at his predecessor's, Trump's spokesperson said that the declaration that they were not just amounted to a presentation of 'alternative facts' . The Internet seems to be acting as a leveling influence here, ironing out the difference between facts and opinions until it becomes impossible to distinguish between the two. When we started our project we thought that the growth of Internet-fuelled conspiracy theories propagated by cultures of alternative belief about governments might not be such a threat to democracy; after the advent of Trump to the Presidency, however, it is starting to look as if a conspiracy theorist is in power. Wolfson Research 26 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Climate change Rebecca Macfie is a senior writer with the New Zealand Listener , a weekly current affairs and arts magazine. She writes feature-length articles on the environment and economy, and was a Wolfson Press Fellow in Easter Term 2017. Despite President Donald Trump's decision to quit the Paris climate accord, the December 2015 deal stands as a seminal moment in human history. It was the point at which the community of nations (now with the exception of just three countries) committed themselves to a revolution. Achieving the target of less than 2 degrees of warming, and staying as close as possible to 1.5 degrees, calls for profound change in every facet of human endeavour. And this revolution must occur within the lifetime of my twenty-something children, if their children are to have a viable future. Economies will have to be fuelled by new energy forms; our modes of transport must radically change; food production systems must be retooled. The revolution must reach even into our home kitchens and rewrite our meat-heavy western menus. In corporate boardrooms, the pursuit of profit must be recalibrated to take account of more frequent and extreme storms and wildfires, and to the risk of financial losses on assets that will be obsolete in a zero carbon future. And even if we manage to unpick the complex economic and behavioural systems that keep us addicted to fossil fuels in time to avoid catastrophic climate change, the world that my grandchildren will inherit will still be warmer and more unstable than today's. As a reporter, no story is more important than the climate story. But it's a hard sell. News - including long-form feature writing - feeds on immediacy, conflict and tension. Turn in a story shouting with acronyms (COPs, REDDs, BECCCs), or laden with '2050 scenarios' , and the editor is likely to spike it. Convey an apocalyptic or moralistic tone and your readers will abandon you before the third paragraph. How to dig through the complexities of climate change to find the stories that resonate? How to tell small stories of change that both reporter and reader can cope with, while keeping the zero carbon endgame in clear view? How to convey the optimism that humanity needs, while remaining alert to greenwash and snake oil? These questions have been my pre-occupation during the 10 weeks of my Press Fellowship. They will continue to challenge me for the rest of my career, but Wolfson has given me the gift of time and fresh ideas to fuel my own contribution to humanity's biggest story. Wolfson Research www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 27Islamic finance Lidiana Rosli is a journalist at Malaysia's oldest English daily, the New Straits Times, founded in 1846 as The Straits Times during the British colonial rule of Malaya. She was a Press Fellow in Easter Term 2017. As I write this, the memories of the tragedy of the London Bridge and Manchester Arena bomb attacks are still very fresh and painful. A global terrorist group, the so-called 'Islamic State' has claimed responsibility. Terrorism, or in fact, terrorism financing was never a point of my research when I arrived at Wolfson as a Press Fellow in April. My research was about the growing Islamic Finance (IF) market in the United Kingdom, its potential towards nation building and its relationship with the local mainstream media. My research however brought me to the most uncomfortable conclusion that the (almost) complete absence of IF coverage in mainstream media in this country is inextricably related to IF being linked to terrorism financing. This realisation, for me at least as a journalist from Malaysia, is incredibly distressing. Malaysia is currently the biggest IF market in the world. This is not an empty claim as data from rating agency, Ram Ratings Services showed that global Islamic bond (sukuk) issuance reached US$22.2 billion, with Malaysia maintaining its leadership by accounting for 38.5 per cent of the total issuances as of 31 March 2017. Outstanding global sukuk meanwhile totalled at US$346.7 billion also in the same quarter, with Malaysia commanding 48 per cent of the amount. IF has for the last three decades been a huge part of Malaysia's economic, finance and nation building; thus to go from a world where IF is adored to one where IF is misunderstood and regarded with suspicion, as well as accused as a mechanism of terrorism, is quite an eye opener. Interestingly enough, the UK has the biggest IF market in the whole of Europe and it is expected to grow even more post-Brexit. Sources close to the UK government told me that the government is prepared to revisit former Prime Minister David Cameron's IF agenda as an investment and funding option post-Brexit, since the government anticipates an outflow of funds from its traditional Western investors. Cameron was particularly ambitious and wanted London to stand alongside Dubai and Kuala Lumpur as one of the great capitals of IF in the world. Indeed, in June 2014, Cameron's government issued Britain's first sovereign Sukuk thus cementing Britain as the western hub for IF. Lectures and Events28 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Art at Wolfson Margaret Greeves (2006), Emeritus Fellow, and Meredith Hale (2009), Fellow The programme of temporary exhibitions continued throughout the year and was remarkable for its contrasts and variety: contemporary British and Russian paintings; twentieth-century social realism and figurative 'inventions'; new and renewed partnerships. Michaelmas began with Alexei Lantsev: Counterpoints (9 October 2016 to 19 February 2017), an exhibition curated and supported by Dr Anna Dempster, College Research Associate. Lantsev's large colourful abstractions inspired by food, wine and music, many of which were created specifically for this exhibition, filled the Dining Hall. His tempera 'Travel Sketches', which hung in the Gallery, introduced another aspect of his work. Alexei and Natasha, his wife, installed the exhibition and generously donated two sketches of Cambridge to the College collection. By contrast, Dr Owen Edwards, Emeritus Fellow mounted an exhibition entitled Valley of Vision (21 January to 16 April 2017) on the theme of the now vanished world of the mines of South Wales. The exhibition was inspired by six key loans, three paintings by amateur artist and miner, Nicholas Evans (1907-2004) and three paintings by George Chapman (1908-1993), who made mining in the Rhondda Valley his primary subject matter. Valley of Vision explored the landscape and the life of the miners and was organised in partnership with the University of South Wales.

Paintings, collages and bronzes exploring the themes of the monumental female figure, symbolic space, and totemic nature, were generously lent by Eileen Cooper OBE RA, Keeper of the RA Schools, and others. The exhibition opened with a podium conversation between the artist and the curator, Dr Meredith Hale, Speelman Fellow, followed by a dinner surrounded by the works. Finally, at the suggestion of Anthony Green RA (Honorary Fellow), Richard Sorrell lent over 30 paintings for the Dining Hall and Gallery clothing the walls with an array of figures arrested and captured in lucid colours while going about their daily lives. The exhibition is open from 27 May to 24 September. It has been a rich and stimulating year for the College and its visitors that would have been impossible without the generosity of the artists, lenders, curators and College staff who devote their time to the fine arts. Richard Sorrell \u00a9 Eileen Cooper RA, New Hall Art Collection, Murray Edwards College, CambridgeLectures and Events30 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Music at Wolfson Juan Pablo Robledo del Canto (2014), Student and Music Society President The 2016-2017 academic year was full of exciting musical events, and we welcomed an increased number of talented Choral Scholars, including soprano Emily Potter, mezzo-sopranos Gwen Davis and Laura Shen, tenors Thomas Stell and Andrei Smid, and baritone Alexander Busch, complemented by organist, pianist and violinist James Downs, who was awarded the Brian Moore Accompanist Scholarship. Wolfson Jazz Nights, held in collaboration with WCSA, became an important addition this year in response to the growing interest in jazz by our student community. Thus, Sam Leak Piano Trio and the (Con)Temporary Quintet delighted us. This latter ensemble featured two new fine additions to Wolfson's musical talent, students Alexis Deighton Macintyre (guitar) and Franz Nowak (piano), who attracted a large and enthusiastic audience which filled our Club Room. Music and Madeira recitals included the amazing Charivari Agr\u00e9able and the virtuosic Duo Bayanello. The Lunchtime Concert Series included performances by our Director of Music, Lynette Alc\u00e1ntara, and pianist Patrick Hemmerl\u00e9 in a fine selection of Lieder, a varied and fun concert by Wolfson Students, and The Mellanie Trio performed sparkling chamber music. World-class pianist Ervin Nagy appeared in collaboration with the Cambridge Szeged Society. Organist and harpsichordist Dan Tidhar gave life to various Early Music Recitals. Both the Wolfson Choir and Wolfson Baroque chamber ensemble - the latter led by resident virtuoso violinist Er-Gene Kahng - delighted the audience with Bach's Cantata BWV 80, as part of the Lent Term Concert A Mighty Fortress is our God, commemorating 500 years since the Reformation. The Music Society would also like to thank Roger Briscoe and Linda Wicker and wish them all the best on their return to their homeland. They not only donated the Steinway grand that now graces the Lee Hall stage, attended and supported every single concert held in College, and sang in the Choir and Chamber Singers, but were also always warm, welcoming and generous to all of us who had the privilege of sharing the stage with them.

The major events for the College included the election of the new President. Not being members of the Governing Body, the Emeritus Fellows had no formal role, but members did attend the interviews and presentations and we had opportunities to express our opinions. The choice of Professor Jane Clarke FMedSci FRS has been enthusiastically supported by the Emeritus Fellows. The Society has organised a wide range of visits to places of interest, which are open to all members of the College and their guests. They included the Fitzwilliam Colour Exhibition of Medieval manuscript illustrations, the North Norfolk Walk, and a visit to Christchurch Mansions Ipswich. Information about our programme of future visits and external events is now available on the College website at www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk/efs. Senior Members Lynn Hieatt (2001), Senior Member Observer Senior Members enjoyed another year of participating in events and supporting the College in a variety of ways. Wolfson's rich offering of lectures, seminars, art exhibits, musical events, dinners, beautiful gardens and interesting outings continued to provide the membership with considerable cultural (and gastronomic) enrichment. Our own series of monthly informal lunches enables us to get to know each other better, and our termly meetings with invited speakers remain highlights. This academic year we invited Mirza Baig, Wolfson's IT Manager; Sheila Betts (Communications Officer) and Fiona Brown (College Secretary); and David Frost (Tutor for part-time Students). Our Summer Garden Party for College Visitors, including CRAs and their families, was held on a stunning, sunny Sunday afternoon in May. Providing practical support is something the membership continues to demonstrate, such as offering assistance to students with hospitality and English-language support. The recent departure of Karen Stephenson as Development Director was marked by generous donations from a number of Senior Members to the Wolf50n Bursary Fund, which was set up by longstanding Senior Member Margaret Whichelow. Wolfson Societywww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 33Humanities Society Mary Newbould (2013), Fellow and Organiser The Humanities Society is Wolfson's prime forum for showcasing the wealth of academic research in the arts and humanities that takes place in Cambridge, and which promotes the College's prominent role within it. Members from Wolfson and Visitors from across the University are invited to offer engaging talks across these disciplines to audiences assembled from the College community and beyond. 2016-2017 has seen yet another successful programme of talks thanks to the organisation of its dynamic committee. Talks have ranged from music, to history, to literature, to law, encompassing the combination of highly distinguished and early career academics invited by the Humanities Society each term. Speakers have included Cambridge-based scholars such as Wolfson's James Westbrook, who spoke on David 'Jose' Rubio, an 'illustrious' maker of guitars; Helen Roche, who addressed childhood under the Nazi regime; Heather Webb, whose illustrated talk on Dante and Botticelli was warmly received; former President Gordon Johnson on scholarly publication in seventeenth-century Oxford and Cambridge; Alex da Costa on Chaucer's 'Pardoner's Tale'; and committee member and Wolfson JRF Boyd Brogan, who presented aspects of his work in the College Research Associates Jocelyn Probert (1998), CRA Secretary Wolfson has 70 College Research Associates, with 10 post-docs joining each year through competitive application and others moving on elsewhere. We generally hold termly meetings and proceed to Formal Hall afterwards. Our Michaelmas event is particularly lively as we welcome new members and Visiting CRAs; this year we also invited Senior Members to join us for social networking. In early 2017 we conducted a survey to discover what motivates Cambridge post-docs to become Wolfson CRAs, the interactions members currently have with the College, and their interests in future activities. The results revealed how much post-docs value having a college affiliation and in particular the social opportunities this brings. There was popular desire to open our meetings and social activities to other Wolfson members. Some CRAs are active participants in the various College research seminar series and a number have taken enthusiastically to the water with the Social Rowing Club. To help future CRAs integrate more easily, we are working with the Research Convenor to develop an information pack that covers all essential aspects of College life.Wolfson Society34 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Science Society Ant\u00f3nio Rodrigues (2014), Fellow Our Science Society aims to promote science and technology among the Wolfson community as well as the public in general. Our lectures on Friday evenings foster a friendly environment for debate and the exchange of ideas. We encourage communication between different disciplines, as we believe that this is crucial for the flourishing of novel scientific ideas. Our talks embrace a broad range of science and engineering topics. We had another exciting academic year with many interesting speakers who covered diverse areas and topics. For instance, Wolfson Fellow George Salmond gave a fantastic talk on the molecular basis of the social lives of microbes and showed how microbial self-sacrifice might work as a weapon against the spread of bacteriophages - the parasites of bacteria - among bacterial populations. Joel Peck explained how evolutionary biology may be used to understand the nature Mary-Ann Middelkoop, Andrea Greve, Alexis Deighton-Macintyre, Rasha Rezk, Ant\u00f3nio Rodrigues, Christine Corton and the President.history of science. The Humanities Society also attracted its typical range of prestigious guest speakers from institutions beyond Cambridge, including Jackie Watson of Birkbeck and Oxford Spires, who spoke on early modern law and literature; Ornit Shani of Haifa University, who gave a talk about 'The Origins of India's Democracy'; and Tanya Aplin, on privacy law. The final meeting of this year of successful and well-attended talks was crowned by the outgoing President, Sir Richard Evans, whose presentation on art and architecture in Nazi Germany provided a fitting College farewell to a significant scholar of the humanities, and a positive gesture towards another fruitful year of Society talks promised in 2017-2018. Wolfson Societywww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 35Lunchtime Seminar Series Christine Corton (2010), Senior Member and Chair The Wednesday lunchtime seminar has heard talks this year on topics including 'The Hidden Heritage of Central Otago's Gold Rush'; 'Same-sex Schoolgirl Josephus upon Christian Art' 'Courts, Constitution and Democracy in Bangladesh'. Wolfson and Kettle's Yard archivist Frieda Midgley argued that 'There should be a Kettle's Yard in every University' while Graham Allen, our Vice-President, raised the question 'Are Dons still a Self-governing Community of Scholars?' College Research the City', featured Nayanika Mathur on wild animals roaming the public places of India, whereas Toby Smith chased cuckoos to highlight their declining numbers. We received advice on our rights as air travellers, while literature was represented by talks on the essays of R L Stevenson and on 'Editing Shakespeare in Translation', Debbie Pullinger investigated the value of the memorised poem, and Burne-Jones's illustrations for the Kelmscott Chaucer were detailed by Alison Syme. We have also enjoyed CRA Philip Loft on British politics from 1689 to 1750, Bernard Collette on 'Ancient Democratic Conceptions of Freedom', Mary-Ann Middelkoop on 'Impressionism and Foreign Cultural Policy in Weimar Germany, 1918-1933', Ghassan Moazzin on 'German Bankers and the Rise of International Banking in China (1885-1919)', Henri Schmitt on the French chanson and Aliandra Barlete on 'the Role of Higher Education in Latin America'. of human societies and ultimately promote cooperation by changing societal environments. Milica Vasiljevic provided many intriguing insights into the complexities of addiction cessation strategies and gave us some evidence that e-cigarettes, as a strategy to stop smoking, may be less effective than previously thought. Nattan Zaccai showed how neutron scattering analysis provides valuable information about the mechanisms underlying the transport of proteins within the cell membranes of bacteria. As always, the discussions after the talks were lively and enlightening. The Society also staged its first debate, which proved extremely popular. Given this success, we aim to replicate this format in future years. We are already planning the list of speakers for the next academic year; you can find our programme online at www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk/seminars/science, and we are also present on Facebook and Twitter. Finally, we are delighted that the University's Vice-Chancellor and Wolfson Honorary Fellow Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz has agreed to become Honorary President of the Science Society. The invitation was sponsored by Dr Christine Corton (Lady Evans) and we are extremely grateful for her support. Wolfson Society 36 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Skills for Academic Success Gillian Sanders, Postgraduate Administrator The Skills for Academic Success programme is now in its fourth year, and was again put together by Jane McLarty (Senior Tutor), Sally Church (Tutor) and Meg Westbury (Lee Librarian), assisted by Gillian Sanders (Postgraduate Administrator). The informal workshops are a forum for friendly debate and take place from 6 to 7pm on Thursdays during Full Term. Following the success last year of extending the invitation beyond Wolfson, we were again pleased to welcome a good number of students from the other mature colleges. Although the main focus is on developing and improving students' skills in oral presentation, academic writing and computing skills, we also introduced sessions that would be of interest to the wider Wolfson community. Twenty workshops were organised. Speakers included Fellows, CRAs and University staff. Some sessions, for example on time management (Jane McLarty and Alun Williams) and keeping mentally well (Caitlin Hitchcock), were relevant to students' academic studies while others focused on interview preparation (Ana Toribio) and the academic publishing landscape (Philip Meyler, Cambridge University Press). Richard Berengarten's practical workshops offered tips on improving writing skills and effective revision, while Ann Copestake's workshop on statistical results helped students recognise the quality of results. David Frost's class addressed the challenge students face of engaging in critical analysis and argument, while Giles Yeo and Charles Jones led a class on the First Year Report. The advantages of keeping up to the minute with social media, discovering the best starting places for effective literature searches and avoiding plagiarism were covered in Meg Westbury's workshops while others focused on writing effective grant applications for research (Alexei Lapkin) and open access and data sharing (Marta Teperek, Research Data Facility Manager, UL). The principles of organising and working more effectively with data were covered by Sergio Martinez Cuesta in his class entitled Managing Research Data. And a small group of students enjoyed a gentle tour of the University Library, from secluded desks to grand reading rooms, guided by Meg Westbury. We wish to thank all the speakers and of course our students whose support made the programme a success. Ideas for future topics are always welcome, so feel free to suggest one that interests you!My journey to Wolfson Reham Elwakil (2016), Student As an MPhil student, I have rooted my academic experience in the seeds of my research. Accordingly, my journey to Wolfson really began in 2013, the moment I was handed a very special mudbrick, handmade by a generous man from New Gourna village on the west bank of Luxor, Egypt. I carried the brick back to the UK and carefully examined it throughout my final year as an undergraduate student. This seemingly simple artefact began to unravel a series of critical socio-political discourses around the effects of modernisation on marginalised communities, fighting for self-sufficiency in a rapidly shifting urban context. These findings became my BA in architecture dissertation, and I eventually carried this investigation further into my MPhil in Architecture and Urban Design course here at Cambridge. Experiencing closely the irreversible physical and psychological impact of social injustice and political unrest on people's lives, I aimed to focus on the important mediating role and social perspective that architects can offer. My work became highly driven by community-based architecture that works on providing people with a sense of cultural ownership as a result of a participatory process. Upon completion of my undergraduate course, my final project was awarded the RIBA NWLSA (North West London Society of Architects) Live Project Award. Shortly afterwards, I moved to Malaysia for a year where I worked on various environmentally and socially driven architectural projects around Southeast Asia. This was followed by an experimental year of working on small-scale interdisciplinary projects including a cultural exchange programme (Tandamize2.0) funded by the British Council and based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. During my stay in Sri Lanka I received an important email from Wolfson College, that instantly recognised my interest in cultural diversity, and warmly welcomed me in. Much like my encounter with the handmade mud brick, I am constantly searching for more seeds of inspiration to drive my academic and professional quest. Luckily, when many people with similar dispositions surround you, the journey naturally gains momentum and value, and this is exactly what my stay at Wolfson is giving me. My journey to Wolfson www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 37 38 The Wolfson Review 2015-2016My journey to Wolfson Adeeba Aziz Khan (2016), Fellow During my teenage years I attended the United World College of South East Asia boarding school in Singapore. Thereafter, I studied for my LLB and UK Bar exams in London and then lived and worked in New York, Dhaka and Singapore before returning to England for my Masters and PhD studies. Given my international background and research focus on law, society and culture, I have always been in the realm of 'overlap' - both in terms of the cultural overlaps within my personal life and the interdisciplinary nature of my research. After obtaining my PhD at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, I joined Wolfson as a Junior Research Fellow. I was born and raised in Bangladesh so I have a natural association with my area of research: constitutionalism in Bangladesh, with a focus on the interaction between formal and informal institutions. I developed a keen interest in politics and cultural factors, such as how patronage can impact on the quality of governance and judicial decision-making, during my time as a Junior Associate at a law firm based in Dhaka. At the time Bangladesh was being governed by a caretaker government under a state of emergency. I practised in the field of constitutional law and public interest litigation, which made me realise that it is necessary to understand the existing social and power relations. Otherwise the puzzle of weak electoral institutions and failing democratic consolidation in Bangladesh cannot be understood, and nor can questions be answered, such as whose interests formal institutions are representing, or what channels of influence are being used, and why these channels exist. College life at Wolfson has truly been a novel experience because for the first time I'm interacting with researchers from many different fields. This has been a unique learning opportunity and being exposed to this level of diversity has strengthened my abilities as a researcher. Although I have lived in a number of countries and have balanced many identities and cultures, this is not always easy. But the diversity of Wolfson and the easy acceptance of difference by its members and staff have made it home for me. Wolfson is the natural College for international students and researchers and I am so grateful that I was given the opportunity to continue my post-doctoral research at this wonderful and most eclectic of colleges. My journey to WolfsonMy journey to Wolfson www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 39My journey to Wolfson Annabel Lawson (2015), Student Every Wolfson mature undergraduate comes with some kind of past, but I was surprised to find I had so very much more of it than most: I was three times as old as the student with whom I shared my first supervision. At the initial Wolfson interview I was asked: 'why do you want to put yourself through this?''What?' I wondered. 'The stress and the pressure' they said. Stress and pressure. Mind-rewind. Financial crash of 2008. Customer dies in North Africa. Mudslide cuts off Machu Picchu. Volcanic ash clouds ground all air travel: groups (with our staff) stranded from Sicily through Turkey to Syria. King of Morocco ejects all tourists from Fez. As unrest grows in the Maghreb and Near East we devise day-long emergency drills together with the Foreign Office. Then one day it happens. The group staying on Green Square in Tripoli, Libya find themselves in the middle of a gun battle. All telephone contact lost. One mobile still working of a group member, who lends it to our archaeologist guide. British Embassy closes and staff are gone when our guide batters on their door. I sleep surrounded by telephones and laptops. Colleagues in Tunisia and Egypt are waiting to help if we can get the group along the rebel-held coast road in either direction. But oh wonder! Our agent in Malta knows the owner of the catamaran sent to pick up US Embassy staff, there may be space. Fifteen triumphant customers made the ten o'clock news as they finally arrived. But it does not stop. Problems keep increasing as the company grows. Thirty years earlier I had set up a cultural travel company, fired by the story of the human past and flushed with a fresh PhD in Archaeology. I drove small groups (and big picnic hampers) around rural Wessex in a minibus: all innocent of the dangers lying in wait. Yet something interesting emerged from them: I had survived those days of stress and pressure by reading poetry and reassuringly unexciting Trollope novels; turning to literature for solace and interest. Perhaps I could start again? It was a thrilling thought. But which university might offer exactly what I wanted? Which might believe in and support this particularly 'mature' student returning as a novice - an undergraduate? Well, you know the answer! The one I chose was Wolfson, and, mirabile dictu, Wolfson chose me. My journey to Wolfson 40 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017My Journey to Wolfson Julia Aldridge, n\u00e9e Moss (1987), Alumna Reading 'My Journey to Wolfson' by Dennis Mubaiwa in the 2015-2016 Wolfson Review was a reminder of just how much Wolfson comes to mean to all those who pass through its doors but particularly to those mature undergraduates who reach Cambridge via more unusual routes. My own journey began in 1986 with an exploratory letter to all the colleges at Cambridge that take mature students. I was lucky enough to receive the most encouraging reply from the then acting Senior Tutor Dr Marie Lovatt who was interested in my previous seven-year career in nursing and recent acquisition of a third A Level in History at evening classes. Like Dennis I didn't feel that my interview went well - Dr Franklin was pretty scary - and I was resolved to going to Leicester instead. It was only when a letter of unconditional offer to read History arrived that I realised how much I wanted to go to Wolfson. The next three years were hard work but wonderful. After I graduated with a 2:1 in 1990 I went to Leicester University to do a PGCE. I then worked as a history teacher for 12 years in an 11-18 comprehensive just south of Birmingham. For much of that time I really enjoyed being in the classroom and teaching a subject I loved. For the last six years I was Head of History and worked with some wonderfully committed colleagues. I finally decided to leave in 2003, I was still happy teaching but not with the relentless pace of change and felt that I needed to do something different. So it was back to college to study horticulture followed by working for a few years as a professional gardener. Wolfson and Cambridge gave me so much - greater self-confidence, a second career, a lovely husband, Roger, and a life-long love of learning. Whilst studying horticulture I became interested in garden history and I am now passionate about the history of art. In turn these interests have given rise to some fascinating travels. Roger and I live just outside Worcester with a half -acre garden and a succession of cats and dogs. This means we don't often get to visit Cambridge but each time we return and I climb the stairs to the Combination Room I see my 25-year old self sitting in one of the big leather armchairs hiding behind a newspaper waiting for my interview. At one point in that interview I was asked why I wanted to go to Wolfson in particular. Maybe it was my answer to that question that helped secure my place - I wanted to go somewhere that was truly cosmopolitan and international, somewhere with a broad range of students from all kinds of backgrounds. Today that is just as important as it ever was, perhaps even more so. Wolfson and Cambridge have shaped my life in so many positive ways. For which many thanks.Wolfson Societywww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 41University Challenge Justin Yang (2015), Student The 2016-2017 BBC University Challenge series was an especially eventful one for Wolfson College as the College's team captained by Eric Monkman and consisting of Ben Chaudhri, Paul Cosgrove and Justin Yang, advanced to the televised rounds. Britain was gripped by 'Monkmania' as the team won fans and supporters from the College, throughout the University, and across social media. Wolfson survived the first round after a nail-biting tiebreaker against the School of Oriental and African Studies then won, more convincingly, against Jesus College, Cambridge in the second round. During the quarterfinals, Wolfson defeated Balliol College, Oxford, before losing to the University of Edinburgh. After a decisive victory against the University of Warwick, Wolfson advanced to the semi-finals where they won against a very strong team from Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In the finals, despite a strong performance, the team lost to the series champions, Balliol College, Oxford. Serendipity seemed at times to favour the Wolfson team. During a break from filming, Eric visited the Imperial War Museum North and learned about the Dardanelles which ended up being the answer to a starter only a few hours later. Similarly, having visited Brussels only a week before a match, Justin was able to recall that it was the Atomium which was 'neither tower, nor pyramid, a little bit cubic, a little bit spherical, half-way between sculpture and architecture' during the tense match against Emmanuel College. Of course, the biggest challenge for the team was keeping the results secret as the show is pre-recorded. Paul notes, \"My family and friends knew only that I had played the first match and not the outcome. However, my mum was a bit more sneaky - I repeatedly asked her for my bank details to make expenses claims - by which she realised and figured out we had been to Manchester three times!\" Above: The Wolfson team with University Challenge presenter Jeremy Paxman Left: The team with Jeremy Paxman and Professor Stephen Hawking, who met the finalists in Cambridge and presented the trophy to Balliol College.Wolfson Society42 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Wolfson College Students' Association Justin Yang (2015), Student and WCSA President, Jason Phan (2015), Student and WCSA Vice-President, and Ben Chaudhri (2014), Student and WCSA Junior Treasurer This was a highly productive and successful year for our WCSA Committee. At the end of Michaelmas, Ents Officer Christian Harvey held a highly successful 'Bridgemas' event which will hopefully be the start of a festive tradition for future Wolfson students. During Lent Term, Christian and Second Ents Officer Sian Bradshaw produced a compelling and memorable series of events, including National Hug Day, Wolfson's Got Talent, and Chocolate Tasting. External Officer, Sebastian Wrobel organised a number of successful swaps during Lent and Easter Terms with Trinity, St John's, Pembroke and Magdalene, in addition to an extended swap to our sister College, St Antony's, Oxford. Alain Kilajian led WCSA's contribution to the Green Impact competition and piloted a highly successful composting program. Alain also organised a Green Week event to raise awareness about sustainable food sourcing and waste reduction in College. Equality & Diversity Officer Azita Chellappoo led initiatives to provide sexual consent and active bystander training in partnership with the Tutorial Office. LGBT+ Representative, Eric Swanson, continued WCSA's successful LGBT group while Disability Representative Aisja Mahmood initiated Wolfson's 'Self-Care Sundays' event during Easter Term. Sports & Societies Officer Dennis Mubaiwa has focused on a major project aimed at improving the College gym facilities, including removal of damaged or defective equipment and acquiring state-of-the-art equipment to help our athletes excel.The 2016-2017 WCSA Committee Row (L-R): (Ents Officer), Sebastian Wrobel (External Officer), Azita Chellappoo (Equality & Diversity Officer), Eric Swanson (LGBT+ Representative).

Secretary Zenas van Veldhoven helped improve WCSA's external communications and kept the Committee organised. Finally, President Justin Yang initiated the inaugural WCSA Student Life Survey to gather vital information about College life at Wolfson and proposed a number of constitutional changes to streamline WCSA governance. The Committee extends a warm thanks to the Wolfson community for continued support and co-operation - we could not have achieved so much without you! We now look forward to inducting newcomers to WCSA in Michaelmas 2017. June Event Brian Robertson (2014), Student After a gap year, the Wolfson June Event was back with a Big Bang on Friday 23 June 2017. This year's event, entitled Aeons , took guests on a journey through the ages of the Earth from the molten landscape of the Hadean to the watery depths of the Palaeozoic. The lucky 750 were guided by a very popular dinosaur through the unique and diverse scenery of the most momentous phases of our ever-changing planet. Lasting till 5am the next morning, it was a busy night filled with music, comedy and entertainment, as well as all-inclusive food and drink. Entertainment was in abundance: laser-tag, life-drawing, water zorb racing, a giant slide, bucking bronco, shisha, casino, silent disco, and Wolfson's very own Howler. Guests also enjoyed a wide range of live music on four stages, with the headliner being The Subways , a British rock band whose lead singer is a Wolfson student. It might well have been the best night in aeons.Wolfson Society44 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Wolfson Reading Group Kim Allen (2008) and Christine Corton (2010), Senior Members It has been an exciting year for the Wolfson Reading Group. We began with What I Loved (Siri Hustvedt, 2003). Hailed by one reviewer as 'a ferociously clever book', it prompted extreme reactions averaging at 6.1. Eight Months on Ghazzah Street (Hilary Mantel, 1988), describing an English woman who feels trapped living in Saudi Arabia, also elicited strong feelings, with a higher score of 7.45. The 2016 Booker Prize winner Sellout (Paul Beatty) failed to arouse the same admiration with the lowest mark of the season at 5.1. Sweet Caress (William Boyd, 2015) was agreed to be a perfectly enjoyable read, but was also felt to lack depth: it scored a creditable 7 out of 10. The highly rated Golden Hill (Francis Spufford, 2016) is a rollicking, picaresque novel with more than a nod towards Tristram Shandy. The discussion in the Group was very lively, but the novel was not universally admired and ended up with an average score of 7.8. Most recently two books were discussed: Burial Rites, (Hannah Kent, 2013) and The Sea (John Banville, 2005). For such seemingly different books, one set in 1820s Iceland, based on the true story of a murderess and the other set from the 1950s up to near-present times in Ireland, they had much in common: the influence of the sea and the presence of early death as an initiator of the plot. Kent's excellent novel accrued the highest mark of the season at 8 with Banville's at 7.5 out of 10. Wolfson Latin Nights Brian Tan (2014), Student Wolfson Latin Night is a thrilling experience, transforming ordinary people into passionate learners of dance under the persuasion of impassioned Latin music. This is where bodies sway sublimely and hearts beat merrily in tandem to the catchy cadences. These weekly occasions are wildly popular among students and dancers in Cambridge. Multi-level salsa or zouk classes are conducted from 8pm and bachata lessons are taught from 9pm. The evening will only end after free and exhilarating social dancing till 11pm! The high-quality lessons, creative dance steps, friendly and fun-loving instructors and dancers make these evenings memorable. Latin Nights are the quintessential dancing experience that will transform you and expand your social circle. We welcome all levels of dancers so see you there!Wolfson Societywww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 45Ballroom Dancing Society Susie Hoelgaard (1976), Senior Member and Organiser Ballroom dancing has been going on at Wolfson for many decades and continues to attract new students and Visitors every year. A steady group of participants joined our weekly sessions in Michaelmas Term and we all had a great time. Our instructor Calla and I do our best to make the lessons fun in a relaxed atmosphere so those who have no dancing experience do not feel intimidated. We did our usual double act introducing beginners to basic steps and routines in the various dances. At first newcomers struggle to coordinate their footwork with the rhythm, hold, leg and hip action, but they have fun together laughing at their first clumsy attempts. We were lucky to have some advanced couples with us to help them learn faster, so before long everyone was happily swinging around the floor to lively Latin rhythms of the jive, cha-cha and swaying to the gentler strains of the waltz, foxtrot and rumba. Dancing serves a valuable function in an international environment like Wolfson as it enables people from all sorts of backgrounds to communicate and make friends across cultural barriers. It's an excellent fitness strategy too for book-weary scholars who can step away from their desks and screens to stretch their legs and minds on the dance floor. Wolfson Society46 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Wolfson Howler Shahid Padhani (2013), Student The current academic year has been another successful one for the Wolfson Howler. For those not familiar with Wolfson's very own comedy night, the event is perhaps best summarised in the words of Varsity (30 May 2016): 'the Wolfson Howler presents a comedy club vibe unlike any other found on the Cambridge scene. It gives rising student comics a place alongside award-winning up-coming names in the wider comedic world. The mixture is a delight to watch.' This year the Howler played host to many brilliant comedians, professionals and students alike, with headliners including John Kearns, Lolly Adefope, Jamali Maddix and Andrew Hunter Murray. In addition, there have been some changes to Howler - regular comp\u00e8res Ed Gamble and Nish Kumar passed the torch to two new ones, Pierre Novellie and Ahir Shah. Both are Cambridge alumni, who first performed at the Howler as students, and who have gone on to be award-winning comedians in their own right. With something for everyone at each event, ranging from geeky to political to just downright weird, combined with the amazing atmosphere created by the comp\u00e8res, the Wolfson Howler is an event not to be missed! Wolfson Societywww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 47Board Games Society Matthias Wong (2013), Student and Society Organiser The Society hosts the weekly Wolfson Games Night, which brings enthusiasts and casual players together for an evening of tabletop adventures. We introduce all types of games, thematic concepts, and game mechanics. These include stalwart classics like the train adventure game Ticket to Ride as well as new releases like the award-winning deduction game Codenames. Every week features a different theme. One week could see a Zen journey along the famous coastal road in Tokaido, and the next a frantic race across Europe in the gothic horror-themed Fury of Dracula. The Wolfson Games Nights are a regular fixture in the College's social calendar, and over the past year they have provided a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for College members to meet new friends. We offer something for everyone looking to have a good time, whether you are a fan of deep strategy or just looking to roll some dice. Noodle Club Corinne Duhig (1981), Director of Studies in Archaeology and College Research Associate Laurence Smith (1985), Library Assistant and College Research Associate Noodle Club is an informal gathering every Friday lunchtime, in which we discuss news items and general themes, serious and lighthearted. And eat noodles and snacks! Many members come to improve their conversational English, to clear up questions about English grammar or improve pronunciation. Importantly, we all enjoy meeting people in different subjects, from different countries and cultures. This year we have welcomed 25 people, from 1 1 different countries, and topics have included elections (including the US, France and the UK's Brexit vote), air pollution, euphemisms, the end of Obamacare, earlier forms of English and even the history of Cambridge University. Noodle Club members with their 'Welcome' messages, outside Fuchs HouseWolfson Society48 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Tea Society Eric Swanson (2015), Student and Society Treasurer The Tea Society began its second year with continuing members as well as many new faces. The weekly gatherings on Sundays brought close friends and new acquaintances together to relax, try new teas and enjoy the company of others. We made some departures from classic British teas this year with sessions dedicated to Chinese floral tea, Japanese matcha tea and Colombian mate tea along with the associated customs for preparing and drinking these teas. The society also sponsored a 'Paws for Tea' bake sale to support the animal welfare charity, Blue Cross. The Tea Society remains a place to gather for the appreciation of tea and conversation.Plant Society Gabriela Doria (2015), Student The Wolfson Plant Society brings together College members fascinated by the diversity of plants and passionate to learn more about them. We want to promote interest in botany, plant sciences, plant diversity, natural history and the uses of plants. During our first year of activities we have walked the Wolfson gardens with Head Gardener Phil Stigwood, visited the 'Orchid Show' at the University Botanic Gardens, and explored Cambridgeshire's woodlands looking for wild orchids. At the University Herbarium, we had the privilege of seeing Darwin's own botanical specimens, which he collected on the voyage of HMS Beagle. In collaboration with Green Week and with the support of WCSA, we provided plants and materials to design mini-rockery gardens of cacti and succulents for our students to bring some green into their rooms. All plant lovers, in and out of College, are invited to enjoy with us the wonders of the plant world! Designing mini-rockery gardens at the launch of Wolfson Plant Society (November, 2016)SportSport50 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Wolfson Sports Dennis Mubaiwa (2015), Student and WCSA Sports and Societies Officer Last year was by all measures a fantastic year for sport at Wolfson, but this year was even better. We are grateful to all our club and societies organisers for the excellent work they've done in running their teams and in creating a positive environment that fosters friendship and community whilst nurturing physical and mental wellbeing. A high number of Blues and Half-Blues were awarded to Wolfson students across a range of sports, showcasing the immense breadth and depth of our sporting talent. The Blues recipients include Tom Kearns (Athletics), Angus Lockhart (Athletics), Veldhoven (Half-Blue, Lightweight Rowing) and Samuel Mann (Half-Blue, Skiing). For the second year running, Midfielder Stefan Wolf and Sports and Societies Officer Dennis Mubaiwa were both awarded Full Blues in Football and Powerlifting, respectively. Wolfson's sporting scene has further expanded: in addition to the wide range of already available sports, students are now able to participate in Cross-Country running and Women's Football. More generally, reports from the captains reflect strong, competitive performances across the board. Stand-out achievements include pool and badminton, whilst cricket, squash, table tennis and badminton have enjoyed lively participation. This undoubtedly reflects a growing interest in College sport, as well as the College's commitment to providing an environment conducive to both physical and mental wellbeing. Thanks to the hard work of the sports captains, who have balanced demanding academic schedules alongside organising matches and training sessions, Wolfson has enjoyed a competitive year. Their efforts leave us in a good position to continue our upward trajectory. Similarly, our high-achieving athletes continue to be a source of inspiration, and in raising the College's profile, a source of pride - we sincerely hope that this continues. Finally, I'd like to thank the College for its continued support in cultivating a positive sporting spirit at Wolfson.Full Blue in Powerlifting went to Dennis Mubaiwa Sportwww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 51Athletics Angus Lockhart (2015), Student and Captain The Achilles Athletics Club (Oxford and Cambridge's combined club) was hosted by the universities of Harvard, Yale, Cornell and Pennsylvania on its tour to the East Coast of the United States this April. Every fourth year a combined Oxford and Cambridge team visits the US, and for two of the three intervening years the British universities host the visiting US teams. The first match was against the combined Harvard and Yale team, and the second against a Cornell and Penn team. These matches were a great experience but sadly both Men's and Women's teams were narrowly beaten in their matches. Wolfson College was also represented at the 143rd Athletics Varsity Match. Tom Kearns and Angus Lockhart were selected to compete as part of the Cambridge University Athletic Club (CUAC) Men's Blues team, and Gunther Klobe in the Men's Second team. The match was held in Cambridge and some fantastic performances were recorded. Gunther Klobe out-jumped both the Oxford Blues and Second team to win the Second team match with a strong performance of 1.80m, finishing narrowly behind the Cambridge Blue's top jumper. Faced with strong competition from Oxford, Tom Kearns ran a personal best of 10.19.99 minutes in the 3000m Steeplechase, coming fourth in the Blues match. Angus Lockhart fielded two personal bests in the Shot Put (14.81m) and Discus (40.86m), winning both of the events in the Blues match, and gaining Cambridge University Full Blues. Despite these successes, Oxford took home the overall match trophies in both Men's and Women's Blues and Second matches, drawing strength from the depth in their squad. Nevertheless, with many new athletes coming into the Cambridge ranks, the future is bright, and CUAC looks forward to future contributions from Wolfson College to its success. Angus Lockhart in the Shot Put final at the British Universities Championship, 19 February 2017Sport52 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Badminton Joachim Dias (2012), Student and Captain This is my last year as Captain of the Wolfson Badminton team as I am finishing my PhD. I'd like to thank everyone who played for us and made all those years so enjoyable. I couldn't have asked for better team mates - all great players and talented people. As usual, our team performed well and reached the semi-finals of the Cuppers tournament. I would like to thank WCSA for providing us with the ability to keep on playing our favourite sport at a good standard. We are now looking for someone to take on the badminton team and club. If anyone is interested, please get in touch with me at jovd2@cam.ac.uk so I can organise the handover. Basketball Xianwei Shi (2014) and Jyothish Soman (2013), Students and Captains This academic year has been very tough as our rebuilding year. Due to injuries of some key players and sometimes a lack of players, we did not manage to get back to the First Division. However, we had some very competitive matches against the best teams in the League. As Captains, we would like to thank the team for standing together and playing some great games, and the College for its strong support throughout the year. Special thanks go to Professor Robert Edelman, who coached us in the Michaelmas Term. We aim to become more competitive and return to the top division next academic year, with the remaining core players and any new players to join us in the future. Looking forward to another great year of Wolfson Basketball.

Wolfson's own James Sutherland now takes up instruction as the Club fosters a beginner-friendly atmosphere while still providing competitive development. Though we have not competed as a club this year, individual members have gone on to succeed at competitions across the UK. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and self-defence system that focuses on grappling to achieve control and submission. Wolfson College BJJ trains at least twice a week during term and membership is open to anyone affiliated with the University of Cambridge, and is free for Wolfson members. For more information please visit www.facebook.com/groups/wolfsonbjj Cricket Karthik Suresh (2016), Student and CaptainThe Wolfson Cricket Club had a tough year after a host of seasoned veterans left our ranks last year. The Club is now in a transition phase as we try to establish a fresh group of keen Wolfson cricketers. This year saw Wolfson re-enter the University Cuppers tournament. After a good win in our first game against Churchill, Wolfson couldn't do enough to get past Girton which saw us exit the tournament prematurely. Our last game of the season was the annual match against the President's XI. The students unfortunately succumbed to an enthusiastic staff and alumni side, but it was a good summer's day that was enjoyed by all. President's Cup Cricket Match 2017 Christopher Lawrence, BursarThe 18th annual cricket match between the Wolfson President's XI and the Wolfson Students' XI took place on Sunday 11 June, with the President's XI coming out as the victors. This was the fourth win by the President's XI in the seven years of Professor Sir Richard Evans' Presidency, bringing the results over the 18 matches to six wins for the President's XI and 12 wins for the Students' XI. This year the President's XI fielded a strong side comprising six alumni, two Fellows, two members of staff and a former Visiting Scholar. Batting first, they got off to a strong start and maintained momentum throughout their innings, reaching 148 for 6 off 20 overs. When the Students went into bat, they were pegged back by an accurate bowling line-up who bowled four maiden overs in the first five overs. The Students never recovered from this slow start, eventually reaching just 92 runs for 6 off their 20 overs, resulting in a 56-run winning margin for the President's XI. Man of the Match was Zabhir Moghal, a Land Economy MPhil student from 2012, who scored 51 not out for the President's XI before then taking three wickets in one over.Sport54 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017The game was played in bright sunshine, and both sides enjoyed the traditional post- match hospitality back at the President's Lodge. Cross-Country Tom Kearns (2015), Student and OrganiserThe newly formed Wolfson Cross-Country club concluded its first season with both the Men's and Ladies' teams finishing in the top half of the Intercollegiate League rankings. Notable individual performances include Tom Kearns who ran for the winning Men's Third VIII at Varsity XC and in the 3k Steeplechase at the British Universities Athletics Championships, and Libby Marchant who ran for the winning Ladies' Mob match team at Varsity XC, and ran the Boston Marathon this year in 3 hours 33 minutes. The Club has used its WCSA funding to purchase team vests which we look forward to getting muddy in next year's Cross-Country season.

This is a great way to meet new people not only from Wolfson but also from Darwin. Training is once a week with two matches (one per team) on the weekend. The teams are not strictly divided into first and second team; we train together and players are selected for matches based on availability, training attendance, and level of play. The season takes place during Michaelmas and Lent Terms however, we organise weekly kickabouts during Easter Term. If you are keen on playing competitive football that still leaves you with sufficient time for your studies - come and join Wolfson College Men's football teams. Ninjutsu Society Antonio Lombardo (2014), Fellow and OrganiserThe aim of the Ninjutsu Society is to study and teach the Japanese martial art of Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu. The Bujinkan system consists of nine separate schools, whose techniques have been transmitted from generation to generation for over 900 years through an unbroken line of grandmasters. Ninjutsu is the martial art practised by legendary Japanese Ninja, includes both armed and unarmed fight and is an excellent self-defence system. Practising Ninjutsu helps develop self-confidence, perseverance, awareness of one's own body, as well as the ability to handle stressful situations. We practise every Saturday and the classes are open to every level. Pool Ioannis Menikou (2014), Student and CaptainWe were very competitive and challenged for first place in the League, right up to the last game of the season, exceeding even our most optimistic expectations. Unfortunately we were defeated in that last and most important game against Downing College. This caused great disappointment in the team, however, it has left us with even more motivation and determination to work harder next year. Our performance in Cuppers was not as successful as in the League, as we were eliminated in the second round. Given that half of the team has now graduated, our aim for next year is to recruit talented and enthusiastic new members and to work together to return to the First Division. Many thanks to all the members of the team, who contributed to a successful and enjoyable year.Sport56 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Squash Louis Ashworth (2015), Student and Captain It has been an interstitial year for Wolfson's squash club. The graduation last year of the formidable Saadiq Moledina, a huge champion and promoter of College squash, was unfortunately compounded by several other key players finishing their studies. A smaller club has operated this year, with Thomas Mullners serving as Captain until Louis Ashworth took over at Christmas. Games have been few as we rebuild, but a tight loss against Jesus College at the end of Michaelmas Term showed there is still strength in Wolfson. We have invested in new racquets, and have the luxury of using the world-class courts at the University Centre. New players are always welcome, and we hope that the next academic year will bring renewed interest and competition into what, in recent history, has been one of Wolfson's top sports teams. Table Tennis Jason Too (2015), Student and Society PresidentThe Society had a fine year as the 2016-2017 academic year saw a big influx of new College members interested in Table Tennis. As a result, we performed strongly again this year, with our team placed second in the Second Division. Currently the Society has close to 20 members and we hold practice sessions in the Lee Hall every Sunday from 8pm to 10pm. All Wolfson members are welcome to join us in these. We are grateful to WCSA and our new members in organising out-of-hours training sessions with our Robo-pong. Zumba, Aerobics and Pilates Society Tessa Stewart (2013), Student and Society Organiser The Zumba, Aerobics and Pilates Society has had a great year: growing in numbers and acquiring beautiful new mats. It has been great to see new members becoming regulars, and we can all feel the benefits of weekly classes! With the quiet period over exam time, we paused our Aerobics and Zumba classes, but still offered weekly Pilates: a great antidote to hours of studying and exam stress. Sadly, we said goodbye to our Zumba instructor, so will be looking for a new instructor to continue Laura's energising classes at the start of the new academic year. We are still very lucky to have Jane as our Aerobics and Pilates instructor: she continually pushes us, providing stimulating and challenging classes.Sportwww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 57Social Rowing Marie Kent (2016), Fellow and Captain Wolfson's newly formed Social Rowing Team (WSRT) took to the water for its inaugural row on Sunday 22 January 2017 and has been meeting at the Wolfson College Boathouse every Sunday morning since. Founded by Fellow Marie Kent, the WSRT is a new venture that caters for members of the College whose commitments prevent them from training with the College crew during the week, or who perhaps have wanted to row but previously have not been able to do so. The team is open to all members and associate members of the College provided they can swim, and meets at 10.45am for an 11am start every Sunday (river closures excepted) to enjoy two hours' rowing on the Cam until 1pm. WSRT has rowers of all abilities, from complete novices to current and former College and City rowers, and we are indebted to our several coaches and coxes from Wolfson and the City clubs who generously donate their time to help us every week. After a few preliminary lessons on the erg and in 'the tub', newcomers progress to 'the eight' where they join the more experienced rowers and everyone practises their skills together. Although the purpose of the WSRT is primarily social, we do have some ambition! As well as striving to emulate the College crews who row past with such panache, we are considering forming a crew to trial for the Bumps next year, and have plans to challenge other Oxbridge Colleges to social rowing events. So together with our Boathouse parties and post-rowing gatherings at the pub, the future is looking eventful! Whatever your ambition, age, ability or experience, you are very welcome to join us at the Wolfson Boathouse on Sundays. We try to row on a weekday evening if our Sunday morning outing is cancelled due to a river closure. Please email the Captain (mek40@cam.ac.uk) to join - we look forward to seeing you there. Inaugural gathering of the Wolfson Social Rowing Team, Wolfson College Boathouse, Sunday 22 January 2017Sport58 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Rowing Valtteri Tulkki (2013), Student and WCBC Captain Wolfson College Boat Club entered three boats for May Bumps this year. Our M2 had a rough start as they got bumped in the first three days. Both M1 and W1 had a strong campaign and both crews entered the last day with a potential of getting blades. W1 had bumped Sidney Sussex W1, Corpus Christi W1 and Emmanuel W2. M1 had taken down Trinity Hall M1, Hughes Hall M1 and Fitzwilliam M1. Hughes Hall M1 had four rowers from the First University boat which is why bumping them was quite an achievement for our M1. On the last day our M2 salvaged their whole campaign with an amazing over-bump. M1 got painfully close to Girton M1 and missed bumping them by just a few strokes as St Catherine's M1 was caught by Girton before Wolfson managed to bump them. In their race W1 easily caught Robinson W1 and continued blading traditions at Wolfson. Up seven positions in total, fourth position in the Pegasus Cup and Blades for W1. Yet another successful May Bumps campaign from Wolfson.

financial support for our students. Below, some of them recount the ways in which grants and scholarships have made a difference to them. Thank you to all donors who have made support such as this possible. Sitong An (2014) Yidi Lu Bursary After finishing high school in Singapore, I wanted to go overseas to continue studying physics. However, I faced great difficulties in the application process due to financial constraints. Wolfson College offered me a place as an undergraduate in the Natural Sciences Tripos, and more importantly, a Yidi Lu Bursary to alleviate my financial burden. It was a life-changing offer, without which I would not have had such wonderful opportunities to continue pursuing my dream at Cambridge and beyond. This year I am on an exchange at MIT and plan to pursue further studies in physics after graduation. I am deeply grateful for this support. Shai Caspi (2013) Yidi Lu Bursary I am a second-year Psychology student, interested in social and developmental Psychology. Due to a change of circumstance back home I ran into financial difficulties and had a hard time paying the high tuition fees. The generous support of Wolfson and the Yidi Lu Bursary enabled me to stay in Cambridge and fulfill my dream. I am extremely grateful for their amazing support and hope to use this experience to empower others as well. Yue Chen (2016) Santander Universities Scholarship As an engineering undergraduate, transferable skills are as pivotal as technical knowledge. I am immensely grateful for the Santander Scholarship awarded by the College. It has given me many opportunities to develop my transferable skills. With my funding, I can take extra foreign language lessons to develop my language skills, and sign up for additional technical courses for my future professional development. It has also enabled me to implement school development projects in Kenya to contribute towards sustainable educational development in Africa. Thus, the award has enabled me to realise my passion as an engineer and has helped me explore future career interest. Newswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 65Philanthropy in Action continued Janina Eberhart (2016) Travel Grant Thanks to my Wolfson Travel Grant I had the chance to attend the Biennial meeting of the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) in Austin, Texas. This conference is one of the biggest on child development and I was thrilled to attend sessions with world leading researchers. Furthermore, I was able to establish contact with two research groups, which use observational measures that are relevant for my PhD research. With one of the groups I am exploring a possible collaboration and with the other I am discussing the option of being trained on their observational tool. Zenobia Ismail (2013) Travel Grant The Wolfson travel grant enabled me to fly to South Africa twice to conduct in-depth interviews with politicians and focus groups with young people for my PhD research on dominant party states. The research found that the youth have divided opinions about the government performance under President Zuma. Corruption and the proposed nuclear deal with Russia are perceived as threats to the economy and employment prospects. The legacy of apartheid is alive and the lingering inequality among black-and-white people remains a serious barrier to the rainbow nation. I am grateful to the College for supporting my fieldwork trips. Andrea Kocsis (2016) Santander Universities Scholarship After graduating in Communication, Archaeology and History in Budapest, Prague and Paris, I joined Wolfson College to read for an MPhil in Archaeological Heritage and Museums. I am immensely grateful to Santander for the award, because without their financial help I would not have been able to start my studies here in Cambridge. I am pleased to continue in Wolfson as a PhD student next year. Antonina Kouli (2015) ALBORADA Scholarship I joined Wolfson College in October 2015 to begin my PhD in Clinical Neurosciences. My work is focused on better understanding the underlying cause of Parkinson's disease, aiming to get one step closer to a cure. However, my educational pursuits would not have been possible without the generous support of the ALBORADA Trust. Thanks to their continued generosity I can devote myself to my goals and focus on my studies relieved from financial burdens and for that, I am truly grateful. Rebeka Reti (2015) ALBORADA Scholarship I am a second year undergraduate Medical student. Coming from a country which is relatively poor by European standards meant that financing myself was a challenge, due to the exchange rate and the difference in wages between Hungary and the UK. Being awarded an ALBORADA Scholarship has enabled me to fully dedicate my attention to my studies and to further pursue my academic interests, for which I am immensely grateful. News66 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Luke Tattersall (2016), Professor Sir David & Lady Williams Law Fund I am grateful to Sir David (dec.) and Lady Williams for their financial support in enabling me to study for a Master of Law degree at Wolfson. Whilst on the LLM programme I have had the opportunity to represent Cambridge's Law Faculty in London, Belgrade and Vienna at the Willem C Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot, which has been a highly rewarding experience. Philanthropy in Action continued Newswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 67The Morrison Society The Morrison Society, named after the College's first President, John Morrison, was established in 2008 for all those who notify us that they have included a legacy to Wolfson College in their Will.

She came to Cambridge from UCL in 1960, as Lecturer in the Philosophy of Science. As this was the era before co-education, Mary was shut out from College life by the mere fact that she was a woman, and so not allowed to dine in any of the men's colleges, even as a guest. She thus remained without a College affiliation for her first five years, until the foundation of Wolfson, then University College, changed the situation for her. She finally found a home in a College that offered men and women Fellowships on an equal basis. Mary joined Wolfson as a Fellow in December 1965, the year of its foundation. In 1976 she was elected Vice-President and in due course chaired the search committee that found David Williams as successor to John Morrison as President. Mary's term as Vice-President came to an end just as David Williams took up the Presidency. In 1985, dissatisfied with the sociological turn that her department was taking, she opted for early retirement. By this time she had attained enormous distinction in her field, having been appointed Professor of the Philosophy of Science at Cambridge, Fellow of the British Academy, and a member of the then University Grants Committee. In 2002 she was awarded an honorary doctorate of science by Cambridge University. Mary was elected Honorary Fellow of this College in 1994, and she continued to be closely engaged with Wolfson as an Emeritus Fellow until shortly before her last illness. Mary came regularly into College for lunch, and was always approachable and had a gift for friendship. In the mid-1980s, she took Certificates in Archaeology and then in Landscape History at Madingley Hall and subsequently researched the place names and medieval field patterns of Cambridge and surrounding districts, reinterpreting significant entries in the Domesday Book. This led her to be elected President of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society. She thus achieved eminence in two entirely separate fields, a rare achievement. Many of those with whom she worked as a landscape historian had no idea that she was an internationally famous philosopher of science. Always unassuming, she seemed genuinely Artist: Peter MennimNewswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 83surprised when she was accorded the many honours which she gathered during her later years. Fittingly, the College commissioned this portrait of her, a reminder of one of our most distinguished, loyal and committed members. Bridget Allchin BA PhD MA FSA Emeritus Fellow 10 February 1927 - 27 June 2017 Gordon Johnson Bridget Allchin was an energetic and distinguished archaeologist and pre-historian of South Asia. She published nearly fifty papers and getting on for twenty books, some in collaboration with her husband, Raymond, that opened up entirely new fields of study. Although she never held University office there is hardly a grant giving body that did not, at some time or other, support her work, and in 2014 she was awarded the Royal Asiatic Society's highest award for her lifetime's contribution to research. She was a founder of the Ancient India and Iran Trust and as its first Secretary did more than anyone to ensure its successful establishment. She was elected a Fellow of Wolfson in 1967 and served as a Tutor 1968-1975. The College, with its egalitarian and cosmopolitan ethos, was ideal for her, and she was particularly sensitive to the needs of students from overseas, especially those from India and Pakistan. After my election to the Presidency, she took pleasure in reminding me that it was she who had first introduced me to the College - in the late 1960s; and for my part I admired her scholarship, her dedication to intellectual endeavour, and her no-nonsense and generous friendliness in everything she did. The College was fortunate to have her among its early Fellows, influencing the growth of the young society in all the best ways. Professor Ernest Jackson Lawson Soulsby, Baron Soulsby of Swaffham Prior Honorary and Emeritus Fellow 23 June 1926 - 8 May 2017 James Wood Baron Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, previously Professor Lawson Soulsby, Head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine, died at home on 8 May 2017. Lawson was an eminent, internationally recognised veterinary scientist and parasitologist. Born in Yorkshire, he came first to Cambridge as a lecturer in Animal Pathology in 1954, a post he held until 1963. He returned to Cambridge to take up the post of Professor of Animal Pathology in 1978, after 15 years at the University of Pennsylvania, and was elected a Fellow of Wolfson. He was Obituaries continuedArtist: Jane Allison Royal Asiatic SocietyNews84 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017subsequently appointed Head of Department and Dean of the Cambridge Vet School until his retirement in 1993 when he became an Emeritus Fellow. During his career he received numerous international parasitology awards and prizes. Soulsby was a member of the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons from 1978 and its President from 1984-1985. He was also President of the Royal Society of Medicine (1998-2000). He was created a conservative life peer in 1990 - and was the first veterinary peer and the first individual to be President of both the RCVS and the RSM. He was in addition the President of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee and the President of the Royal Institute of Public Health until 2008, when it merged with the Royal Society of Health to become the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH). He served the new body as President until the end of 2009 and became an Honorary Fellow of the RSPH. He was a founding Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. Throughout his career, Lawson pioneered the concept of One Health in Britain, recognising the interconnectedness of human and animal diseases. He sat on and chaired the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, notably identifying as a key threat to human health the uncontrolled use of antimicrobials in animal feed as growth promoters. Norma Bubier MA DPhil Senior Member 22 October 1956 - 9 August 2016 Harry Bradshaw An Oxford-trained Ecologist, it was my wife Norma's desire for social justice and appreciation of nature and culture that led her, by the 1990s, to work with the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon, Guyana in South America. As Executive Director of Pro-Natura UK she worked in partnership with local communities and a visionary Makushi leader, Sydney Allicock. By 1998, Bina Hill Institute was conceived and constructed in a remote region, the first training centre for Indigenous youth focussed on natural resource management, sustainable forestry and much else (see Guyana newsletter 2015, http:// www.pronatura.org). Following Guyana's May 2015 General Election, Sydney Allicock became Minister for Indigenous Peoples' Affairs, the first Indigenous person to occupy this post. In October Norma was appointed Programme and Scientific Advisor to this Ministry, the plan being to build training centres, based on Bina Hill, across the Amazon region. She worked on this right to the end. Norma's legacy includes an archive of Makushi and Wai-wai artefacts (Horniman Museum, London), an archive of interviews with Leach-related potters (British Library Sound Archive, London; C1330 at http://bit.ly/1UkpKm3) and the College's signature studio pottery collection (Wolfson Review 39 page 30). She also cherished Cornwall, sacred music and retreats with Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh.Obituaries continuedNewswww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 85 John Cathie BA MLitt MA PhD Emeritus Fellow 10 October 1946 - 15 November 2016 Marie Lovatt I first met John after I became a Tutor at Wolfson in 1981. He was sitting at his desk in his office in Bredon House, wreathed in cigarette smoke. Behind him hung a vast print of an enormous and very stylish pig. He turned out to be a funny, intense, immensely kind man utterly devoted to the interests of his students, and he held firm views about almost everything. John was, first and foremost, a Scot. He gained a BA Hons (1974) and a PhD (1985) from the University of Strathclyde in Economics, and an MLitt from St Andrews (1976). He became a Senior Member of Wolfson in 1978, subsequently holding a Cambridge MA (1980) and a Fellowship and Tutorship in the College from 1981. In 1991 John became Acting Senior Tutor and Senior Tutor in October 1992, but resigned after serious disagreements with John Tusa, then recently elected as President of the College. He was also Assistant Director of Research in the Department of Land Economy from September 1976 and for a time directed studies in Land Economy at Wolfson. His own academic interests lay in Food Aid, on which he wrote copiously, and he was very interested in the economics of the developing world. John continued to come into College after 1992 for some years, but infrequently due to his increasing ill health. Away from his academic life, John had also had many other interests, as his wife Margaret remembers. The life and works of Robert Burns were his continuing passion, as were art, music, wildlife, politics (especially Scottish), and the world in general. Indeed the very last thing he did was to enjoy a glass of Scottish Malt Whisky. Christopher Barker PhD Former Fellow 19 May 1938 - 12 May 2017 John Rees Chris Barker was a past Fellow of the College and a distinguished scientist in the field of cancer research. He took a degree in chemistry at Nottingham University in 1960 and went on to complete a PhD in Nottingham's Cancer Research Laboratory in 1964. His interest in the mechanisms of cancer development led him to a research chemist post in the Department of Medicine at Cambridge in 1967 at the old Addenbrooke's hospital site. When the newly formed Department of Haematological Medicine moved to the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Chris joined the team as a lecturer and Senior Research Fellow. His early work gained him an opportunity to take up a Research Obituaries continuedNews86 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017Fellowship at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California in 1973-1974 and 1979-1980 where his interest shifted towards immunology and the role of T-Cells in haematological malignancies. He has published influential work in journals including Nature and Blood. In his latter years Chris served as Secretary to the Joint Degree Committee of the Medicine and Veterinary Medicine faculties. He also took on the role of Radiation Protection Officer for the University of Cambridge, a difficult role requiring diligence and diplomacy in equal measure. Chris was married to Pat and they had three children. He has been described by his family as very 'laid back' and he was certainly the voice of reason and calm in his relationships with his colleagues.

Like fiercely-flickering, bright yellow flames, Resisting the wind with its cutting, chilly sweep, As I finally climb Wolfson's stairs to its august Hall of Feast,Where scholars from far-flung lands I meet, A rare, fascinating cosmopolitan mix, Of people not caring to wear their scholarship on their sleeves, Wrapped in conversation exuding warm camaraderie, Making me exclaim: Here, indeed, is 'God's Plenty' .www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 101 Membership Membership102 The Wolfson Review 2016-2017 MembershipWolfson College As at 31 July 2017 College Officers President: Richard Evans Kt MA (inc) Christopher Lawrence MA MSc ARCM Senior Tutor: Sian Cook Praelector: Brian Cox BSc MA PhD Dean Students Raymond Bujdoso BSc PhD Tutors Anna Bagnoli BSc PhDDavid Frost BEd MA MA PhDKevin Greenbank MA PhD Lesley MacVinish BSc MA PhD Mary Newbould BA MPhil PhD (Postgraduates)Michael MA PhD (Undergraduates, Arts and Humanities) Lesley MacVinish BSc MA PhD (Undergraduates, Sciences) College Teaching Officers Michael Hrebeniak BA MA PhD (English)Astron Douglas BComm LLB of Music Lynette BA AMusA MA Press Fellowship Director John Naughton BE MAwww.wolfson.cam.ac.uk 103 MembershipNew Fellows 2016-2017 Honorary Fellow Professor Spyridon Flogaitis was born and brought up in Lefkas, Greece and went to the Universities of Athens, Paris II and Paris I.
